The Conservatives have been keen to recruit Woodhead ever since his abrupt resignation from Ofsted on November 3.

He would supersede Theresa May, who may retain her shadow education role in the House of Commons. With the new year's honours list due to be published on Saturday, there is intense speculation that Woodhead's return to public life is imminent.

More recently, Woodhead had high-decibel spats with Blunkett and his officials over alleged financial waste in the school system, and over Labour grassroots resistance to the abolition of local education authorities. He has also been scathing about education action zones and other inititiatives he dismisses as gimmicks.

Like the other celebrities who have featured, she concedes that she is not up to the task. </p> <p>As well as boosting applications, a Home Office survey in dicates that the advertisements have painted a more complex picture of police work in the minds of the public. </p> <p>The police service has been battered by bad publicity in recent years and is suffering from poor morale. </p> <p>Figures released when the recruitment campaign was launched in August showed the number of police officers in England and Wales had dropped from 127,158 in 1997 to 124,418 by March this year. </p> <p>Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens warned this week that pressure on resources was leading to police on the beat being transferred to answer emergency calls and carry out administrative tasks. </p> <p>He said 200 officers had been transferred off the streets and that by February, the Met would be short of 1,000 civilians and 2,500 uniformed officers on six years ago. </p> <p>However, yesterday's figures showed that Sir John's force, hardest hit by the recruitment crisis, has enjoyed the most interest with 1,127 applicants. </p> <p>New government figures released separately showed that the number of new police trainees entering colleges had risen by 41% from April to November this year. </p> <p>Home Office minister Mike O'Brien said the government was keen not only to raise numbers but to show the public the difficult and challenging circumstances in which police officers worked. </p> <p>But critics have pointed out that the crucial problem is not in generating interest but in recruiting and retaining officers. </p> <p>In March the home secretary, Jack Straw, announced that recruits to the Metropolitan police would be offered a bonus of up to \u00a33,000 to ease the cost of living in the capital. </p> <p>The extra cash was to make up for a London housing allowance that was scrapped five years ago and took a new constable's pay package to \u00a323,500 a year.</p>",

The campaign continued last night with a 60-second slot on ITV featuring the broadcaster Joan Bakewell, who is asked whether she could remain emotionally detached while interviewing a suspected rapist. Like the other celebrities who have featured, she concedes that she is not up to the task. As well as boosting applications, a Home Office survey in dicates that the advertisements have painted a more complex picture of police work in the minds of the public. The police service has been battered by bad publicity in recent years and is suffering from poor morale. Figures released when the recruitment campaign was launched in August showed the number of police officers in England and Wales had dropped from 127,158 in 1997 to 124,418 by March this year. Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens warned this week that pressure on resources was leading to police on the beat being transferred to answer emergency calls and carry out administrative tasks. He said 200 officers had been transferred off the streets and that by February, the Met would be short of 1,000 civilians and 2,500 uniformed officers on six years ago. However, yesterday's figures showed that Sir John's force, hardest hit by the recruitment crisis, has enjoyed the most interest with 1,127 applicants. New government figures released separately showed that the number of new police trainees entering colleges had risen by 41% from April to November this year. Home Office minister Mike O'Brien said the government was keen not only to raise numbers but to show the public the difficult and challenging circumstances in which police officers worked. But critics have pointed out that the crucial problem is not in generating interest but in recruiting and retaining officers. In March the home secretary, Jack Straw, announced that recruits to the Metropolitan police would be offered a bonus of up to \u00a33,000 to ease the cost of living in the capital. The extra cash was to make up for a London housing allowance that was scrapped five years ago and took a new constable's pay package to \u00a323,500 a year.",

The blast was relatively small, but it inevitably revived dreadful memories of the wave of suicide bomb attacks on Israeli buses in the spring of 1996. There has as yet been no claim of responsibility, but suspicion clearly centres on Islamist militant groups which have vowed to sabotage the crumbling peace process. Even before today's Tel Aviv blast, tension was running high in Israel and the Palestinian territories as leaders backed away from a key US-brokered summit meeting in Egypt. The summit was abruptly cancelled after Israel apparently decided that it was not worth attending. The Palestinians had earlier signalled their strong objections to US draft proposals for a final settlement - proposals which the Israelis had accepted in principle, but with serious reservations of their own. On the face of it, President Bill Clinton's last desperate attempt to secure a peace deal before he leaves the White House on January 20 has comprehensively foundered. Yet in the byzantine world of Middle East diplomacy, nothing is ever that certain. The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has flown to Cairo for talks with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, who longs to host a successful peace summit. The political survival of the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, depends on a deal, and he has not ruled out a meeting with Mr Arafat. And President Clinton, still seeking the holy grail of a final settlement, says he believes the two sides are \"closer than they have ever been before\". Both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders know that the US proposals are the best - maybe the last - chance they have of rounding off the peace process which began in 1993. But both also know that a deal on Washington's terms would be wildly unpopular with their own peoples. For Israel, it would mean the creation of a full-fledged Palestinian state on their doorstep, the forced evacuation of thousands of Jewish settlers from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and, most dramatically, a Palestinian presence in Jerusalem. The proposal which has most inflamed militant Zionists and Jewish zealots is that Israel should hand over sovereignty to the Palestinians over most of al-Haram as-Sharif, the mosque complex which is Islam's third most sacred place, but which is also the most holy site in Judaism. Jews call it the Temple Mount, and although they would retain the part which is most important to them, the Western or Wailing Wall, the loss of the rest of the site is simply unthinkable to many Israelis. Equally unthinkable to Palestinians is the American proposal that they drop their demand for up to 4m refugees to be allowed back to their homes in Israel and the occupied territories. The refugees' right of return is embedded in modern Palestinian lore. Most of the refugee families, scattered in mostly squalid camps throughout the region, still possess title deeds and even keys to homes long since occupied or demolished by Israelis. Their continued exile, more than 50 years after the creation of Israel, is the most potent symbol of Palestinian humiliation. These issues are central to the peace process. Only by constantly putting off discussion of them, has that process managed to limp along for seven frustrating and often bloody years. Now there are fears that Clinton's imminent departure from office will remove the last element of momentum from the interminable negotiations. Another body-blow could be struck if, as widely predicted, Mr Barak loses the prime ministerial direct election on February 6 to his rabidly rightwing rival Ariel Sharon. With nerves scraped raw by political uncertainty, the only ray of light in recent days has been a sharp diminution of the Palestinian \"intifada\", or uprising, which has claimed more than 350 lives in three months. But even as the daily confrontations subside in scale and ferocity, the Tel Aviv bus bombing is a reminder of the dark forces which are hellbent on a final, violent, solution.

      "bodyText": "While London commuters may begrudge paying \u00a33.90 for a day's travel on the underground, Hollywood directors are queuing to pay \u00a3200 an hour to turn the Tube into a film set. Last year, London Underground received over 200 filming requests and provided the backdrop for scenes from this year's hit, Billy Elliot. Previously it has been used as a location for films ranging from action blockbuster Mission Impossible to Sliding Doors, a romantic comedy starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and The Wings of the Dove, set at the beginning of last century, with Helena Bonham Carter and Linus Roache. Now, the Tube's directors plan to further boost its movie appeal and have launched a marketing drive to entice the film industry's big names to the delights of London's subway. London Underground has launched a glossy brochure, ranging from the grandeur of 1930s art deco stations to the futuristic Jubilee Line extension. London Underground's commercial filming facilities manager, Kate Blow, said: \"We hope this new brochure will help promote London Underground as a premier film location. \"We don't make a vast amount of money from filming but at \u00a3200 an hour it is certainly a useful money spinner.\" Most film-making takes place at night or at stations normally closed at weekends. Canary Wharf station was the most popular film set last year because of its futuristic appeal. However, the Waterloo and City line has also proved attractive because it is closed on Sundays, making it ideal for uninterrupted filming. While London Underground has been able to accommodate most film-makers' requests such as the need to redecorate platforms, some were turned down on safety grounds or in the interests of taste. One company wanted to feature a stuntman performing somersaults over the track, but was diplomatically told that the 640 volt current made this impossible on health and safety grounds.",

His contribution over the last two decades has been absolutely crucial in reformulating the psychoanalytic project to meet the intellectual and emotional demands upon it a century after its birth.</p> <p>In 1983, Mitchell published the first of many books which bore the hallmark of his intellectual approach. With Jay Greenberg, he wrote Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory, in which they brought both a generosity and a rigour to the work of other theorists whose various attempts to understand the structures of the inner world had resulted in a profusion of concepts that looked similar, even sounded similar, but often meant very different things in theory and in practice.</p> <p>Mitchell and Greenberg looked for the links, the strengths, the arguments that the psychoanalysts themselves were trying to make about their theories, often setting them out better than they had themselves, in order to draw a historical and philosophical picture of the mental world individuals create within themselves to handle distress and conflict. They argued that there were two dominant tendencies within the field, a drive model in which the mind is prestructured to use relationships with parents and others as a source of drive gratification, and the relational model in which it is the actual interaction with others that creates the structures of the mind.</p> <p>In Relational Concepts in Psychoanalysis (1988), Mitchell proposed a paradigm shift within psychoanalysis, elegantly and persuasively arguing for the insistence on relationship as the determining feature in human psychological life. Without sacrificing Freud's great contributions to our notions of the unconscious, of the role of conflict, of sexuality, and of infancy, Mitchell determinedly and persuasively insisted that the complexity and subtlety of human relations are best understood within the individual's inevitable struggle both to connect with others and yet be autonomous. He understood that individuality and uniqueness comes out of and is expressed in relationship; that the concept of individuals coming together to form a society is a nonsense, for the individual emerges out of human relatedeness and is always embedded within it.</p> <p>Drawing on the work of the Scottish analyst, WRD Fairbairn, he addressed the problem of human agency, the individual not simply as a tabula rasa, but as a figure whose idiosyncratic and deeply personal responses and reactions within the relational matrix are an expression of her or his unique will.</p> <p>He saw the complexity of defence structures both as they were expressed in the patients he saw and supervised, and through the relational demands that were thrown up within the analytical relationship. He helped a whole generation of analysts recognise that one of the critical dilemmas of treatment, those moments when the analyst privately experiences her- or himself as embroiled with the patient's inner world, were the inevitable consequence of addressing relational theory in the consulting room.

His contribution over the last two decades has been absolutely crucial in reformulating the psychoanalytic project to meet the intellectual and emotional demands upon it a century after its birth. In 1983, Mitchell published the first of many books which bore the hallmark of his intellectual approach. With Jay Greenberg, he wrote Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory, in which they brought both a generosity and a rigour to the work of other theorists whose various attempts to understand the structures of the inner world had resulted in a profusion of concepts that looked similar, even sounded similar, but often meant very different things in theory and in practice. Mitchell and Greenberg looked for the links, the strengths, the arguments that the psychoanalysts themselves were trying to make about their theories, often setting them out better than they had themselves, in order to draw a historical and philosophical picture of the mental world individuals create within themselves to handle distress and conflict. They argued that there were two dominant tendencies within the field, a drive model in which the mind is prestructured to use relationships with parents and others as a source of drive gratification, and the relational model in which it is the actual interaction with others that creates the structures of the mind. In Relational Concepts in Psychoanalysis (1988), Mitchell proposed a paradigm shift within psychoanalysis, elegantly and persuasively arguing for the insistence on relationship as the determining feature in human psychological life. Without sacrificing Freud's great contributions to our notions of the unconscious, of the role of conflict, of sexuality, and of infancy, Mitchell determinedly and persuasively insisted that the complexity and subtlety of human relations are best understood within the individual's inevitable struggle both to connect with others and yet be autonomous. He understood that individuality and uniqueness comes out of and is expressed in relationship; that the concept of individuals coming together to form a society is a nonsense, for the individual emerges out of human relatedeness and is always embedded within it. Drawing on the work of the Scottish analyst, WRD Fairbairn, he addressed the problem of human agency, the individual not simply as a tabula rasa, but as a figure whose idiosyncratic and deeply personal responses and reactions within the relational matrix are an expression of her or his unique will. He saw the complexity of defence structures both as they were expressed in the patients he saw and supervised, and through the relational demands that were thrown up within the analytical relationship. He helped a whole generation of analysts recognise that one of the critical dilemmas of treatment, those moments when the analyst privately experiences her- or himself as embroiled with the patient's inner world, were the inevitable consequence of addressing relational theory in the consulting room. For Mitchell and the group working around him, the analyst moved from being an external, evaluating, neutral observer of the patient's distress to being a co-participant in the dramas and struggles of the patient to develop. The patient needed not just to be witnessed, heard and interpreted by the analyst as a transference figure, but also needed recognition and a palpable emotional relationship in which the analyst was unafraid to become entangled by the very issues that perplexed the patient. More books followed, including Freud and Beyond with his wife Margaret Black (1995), and a new book, The Degradation of Romance (to be published in 2001), addressed to a more popular audience. Born in New York, Mitchell graduated from Yale with philosophy as his main subject, and took a doctoral degree in clinical psychology from New York University (NYU) in 1972. In 1977, he completed his psychoanalytic training at the William Alanson White Institute. At NYU he became an adjunct professor and clinical supervisor of postdoctoral studies in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, and at the White Institute he was a training analyst. While his lucidly written books had a wide readership, most psychoanalysts know Mitchell through the innovative scholarly journal Psychoanalytic Dialogues (PD), which he founded in 1991. Each new issue was the most avidly awaited journal of the field: the articles were well written, with thoughtfulness and originality encouraged; they often addressed the leading edge of clinical practice, so that the preoccupations of practising analysts - their subjectivity, their erotic countertransference, issues of dependency - could be rigorously questioned from fresh perspectives; part of each issue was organised as a dialogue in which leading thinkers would engage with one another over critical issues in theory and practice; and there was the sense that PD represented a community of analysts hard at work, in dialogue to create new understandings and to push their field forward. The excitement that came off the pages was palpable. The element of dialogue was particularly apt: although avowedly relational, Mitchell invited analysts of other persuasions who had things to say to think through their arguments on the pages of PD, and allow themselves to influence and be influenced by the positions of colleagues from another idiom. This allowed psychoanalysts, so good at listening to others and so often inadequate at listening to one another, to really take on and hear the strengths in each other's positions and the historical and philosophical basis of those positions. The work of theory-making, in relation both to theory about practice and theories of development and change, thus reflected Mitchell's intellectual commitment, purpose and passion for dialogue, listening and learning. The energy generated by the journal encouraged Mitchell and others to start an even more participatory organisation, the International Association for Relational Psychoanalysis, of which he was to be the first president. For those of us 3,000 miles away from the New York scene, this was a welcome way in which to participate in developments in relational practice. Stephen's loss is incalculable. Those who spoke to the thousand and more people at his funeral said that his loss will be as large as the space that he occupied. All of us who have been touched by his intellectual acuity and generosity echo that sentiment. Stephen Mitchell is survived by his wife, and their daughters Caitlin and Samantha.",

      "bodyText": "George W Bush's incoming administration is preparing for a more aggressive onslaught on guerrillas and drug traffickers in Colombia, a confidential speech by a senior adviser reveals. Robert Zoellick, who is to be appointed to an international policy post in the Republican administration - possibly chief trade representative - said: \"If the Colombian people are willing to fight for their own country, then the US should offer serious, sustained and timely financial, material and intelligence support.\" His speech, which was delivered to the Council on Foreign Relations a week before the November 7 presidential election, suggests a big shift in Washington's policy on Colombia, just as President Andres Pastrana appears to be on the verge of making peace with the country's second-biggest leftwing rebel force, the National Liberation Army (ELN). The Clinton administration's tried to stay out of the 36-year civil war while giving multimillion-dollar aid packages intended for action against drugs. Rightwing critics such as Mr Zoellick say that policy is soft on leftwing guerrilla movements such as the ELN and the larger Farc. \"We cannot continue to make a false distinction between counter-insurgency and counter-narcotics efforts,\" Mr Zoellick said. \"The narco-traffickers and guerrillas compose one dangerous network.\" Leftwing critics, on the other hand, say the Clinton policy gives the Colombian armed forces too much leeway to divert US aid to rightwing death squads waging a largely unchecked war against the guerrillas. Death squads have carried out three-quarters of the 4,000 annual political killings. One critic, Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, said this week that the Clinton administration's refusal to attach human rights guarantees and conditions to Washington's latest $1.3bn (\u00a3870m) aid package to Colombia \"sent a terrible signal\". When the issue comes up for review next month, Mr Wellstone says, no aid should be given until all human rights terms are met. But Mr Zoellick's tough speech suggests such that an effort is doomed. It ignored human rights conditions, and called on the \"forces of democracy\" to combat \"new threats to security\" in Colombia. Such a policy appears to align the new administration with the Colombian military and the death squads against Mr Pastrana and the left. The prospect of a change in US policy could hardly come at a more delicate time in Colombia's long-running crisis, which has claimed more than 35,000 lives in the past 10 years and creates 300,000 refugees each year. Thousands of Colombians have also been kidnapped, by both sides. Last weekend the ELN freed 42 police officers and soldiers, a Christmas gesture which appeared to crown Cuban-brokered talks between Bogota and the ELN aimed at establishing a demilitarised enclave run by the ELN in Bolivar region in the north. If it is finally agreed, the land-for-peace deal with the 5,000-strong ELN will be similar to a pact two years ago between Mr Pastrana and the Farc. That deal was criticised because of the continuing claim of human rights abuses by Farc and because the armed forces have never accepted the deal's legitimacy. That has led Bogota to press for tougher terms in any agreement with the ELN. Residents of Bolivar are demanding such conditions, because they fear a demilitarised zone could lead to increased violence. The land-for-peace deals with the guerrillas are intended to be a prelude to full-scale peace talks. The deal with Farc laid down two years of peace talks which have not so far led to any hoped-for agreement. The Farc has until January 31 to return to talks or see the military allowed back into the demilitarised zone. A deal with the ELN would involve promises by both sides to hold full peace negotiations within nine months, Mr Pastrana said this week.",

      "bodyText": "It is all very well for Michael Scott-Joynt (A defender of the only faith, December 27) to claim that \"tolerance... owes a great deal to the Church of England\", but I belong to a tradition (Baptist) that was persecuted by the state (hand-in-glove with Church of England) until the end of the 17th century and was looked down on with disapproval by the same Church of England for long after that. Tolerance in British society actually owes far more to the dissenting tradition than it does to the C of E. Philip Clements-Jewery, Basildon, Essex \u0095Tom Lewis (Letters, December 27) is mistaken to claim that Henry VIII \"went after the Catholics\" and to describe Catholics as a \"minority\". Henry VIII may have ruthlessly annexed church property and authority in England, but he regarded himself as a Catholic until he died and vigorously persecuted protestant \"heresy\". And Catholics were certainly still in the majority at the end of his reign and quite possibly into that of his Anglican daughter Elizabeth, never mind that of his Catholic daughter Mary. He would have been with Lewis on the killing of animals for sport, though. He just wouldn't have described it as \"culture\". Stephen Brasher, London \u0095Supporters of field sports are not the largest minority to have their culture abused in the last 400 years; that would be the racists and the homophobes. Like the pro-hunting lobby, they are in the wrong. Colin Beveridge, St Andrews, Fife",

Black people are more likely to be detained in locked wards, more likely to be given high doses of medication, and less likely to be offered appropriate services.</p> <p>A welcome measure in the white paper is the recognition that people subject to compulsory treatment should have a right to an independent advocate. If black people had access to an advocate who has an understanding of their culture during the assessment period, this could help reduce the sort of misunderstandings and racist assumptions that are now all too common. However, the proposals appear to promise an advocate only after assessment has been completed. Unless these issues are addressed when the bill is published, the proposals to allow compulsory treatment in the community are likely to impact more severely on black and ethnic minority patients. No doubt I shall not be the only Labour MP making representations.</p> <p>Helen Brinton MP</p> <p>\u0095The government's plans for the mentally ill and those deemed to have a personality disorder are shameful. It seems that the mentally ill are not as human as \"us\" and their rights can be truncated accordingly. The mentally ill are sick, not sub-human, and many Guardian readers will suffer from one mental illness or another at some point in their lives. Suicide rates among this group of patients are already unacceptably high, but how many more will be driven over the edge by this government- decreed stigma. There are already many attacks by the \"normal\" on the ill, now some legitimisation has been offered to these acts.</p> <p>Hilary Eddy, Penzance, Cornwall</p> <p>\u0095Psychiatric disagnosis is not exact: you cannot diagnose a disorder as you can a broken leg. Yet people are now to be locked up on the basis of what are no more than educated guesses. Meanwhile, those patients who remain free are to be deprived of the right to decide for themselves whether their medication - which can be harmful - is suitable or necessary. It is no use talking of \"safeguards\". Anyone who, like me, has been through the psychiatric system, knows how difficult it is to get professional people, like doctors, to accept that their colleagues are capable of error. And the stigmatising of mental patients implicit in these proposals makes it that much more unlikely that the patient's views will be listened to.</p> <p>Justin Horton, Loughborough, Leics</p>",

Black people are more likely to be detained in locked wards, more likely to be given high doses of medication, and less likely to be offered appropriate services. A welcome measure in the white paper is the recognition that people subject to compulsory treatment should have a right to an independent advocate. If black people had access to an advocate who has an understanding of their culture during the assessment period, this could help reduce the sort of misunderstandings and racist assumptions that are now all too common. However, the proposals appear to promise an advocate only after assessment has been completed. Unless these issues are addressed when the bill is published, the proposals to allow compulsory treatment in the community are likely to impact more severely on black and ethnic minority patients. No doubt I shall not be the only Labour MP making representations. Helen Brinton MP \u0095The government's plans for the mentally ill and those deemed to have a personality disorder are shameful. It seems that the mentally ill are not as human as \"us\" and their rights can be truncated accordingly. The mentally ill are sick, not sub-human, and many Guardian readers will suffer from one mental illness or another at some point in their lives. Suicide rates among this group of patients are already unacceptably high, but how many more will be driven over the edge by this government- decreed stigma. There are already many attacks by the \"normal\" on the ill, now some legitimisation has been offered to these acts. Hilary Eddy, Penzance, Cornwall \u0095Psychiatric disagnosis is not exact: you cannot diagnose a disorder as you can a broken leg. Yet people are now to be locked up on the basis of what are no more than educated guesses. Meanwhile, those patients who remain free are to be deprived of the right to decide for themselves whether their medication - which can be harmful - is suitable or necessary. It is no use talking of \"safeguards\". Anyone who, like me, has been through the psychiatric system, knows how difficult it is to get professional people, like doctors, to accept that their colleagues are capable of error. And the stigmatising of mental patients implicit in these proposals makes it that much more unlikely that the patient's views will be listened to. Justin Horton, Loughborough, Leics",

Awards for books and for beauties, for wine and for poets, for businesswomen and for dogs; even, incredibly, awards for journalists. What we need is fewer awards, not more.</p> <p>On the other hand, does not this very profusion argue for the creation of additional prizes, to honour all those categories that have mysteriously been overlooked? If, say, bottoms have their own celebrated annual award - then why not life peers? If slimmers, who have powerful health reasons to shed their bulk, are eligible for prizes, then why not baronesses who accept their most solemn duties out of a simple desire to serve? If the lowliest \"parliamentarian\" stands the chance of public recognition for this futile and now thoroughly discredited activity, then why not one of our new placemen and placewomen, who are doing so much more to bring about Blair's vision of \"a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege or class or background, but on the equal worth of all\"? What backbench MP, this year, has done a 10th as much as the prime minister's former cohabitee, Lord Falconer, to make this a model parliamentary democracy of which we can be proud?</p> <p>One of the great difficulties, of course, in choosing a <b> Placeperson of the Year </b> , lies in detecting what exactly has been achieved, and by whom. With Tony Blair creating around 80 peers a year, and the creation of more than 300 task forces, staffed by more than 2,000 unelected placepersons, it is almost impossible to keep up with the quantity of good work being done.</p> <p>Naturally, not having been elected, placepeople do not answer to the House of Commons, nor is membership of the House of Lords any guarantee of transparency. One thinks, for example, of his secretive lordship, Lord Levy, whose quiet diplomacy in the Middle East as the unofficial emissary of Tony Blair, was unknown to most of us until the Sunday Times decided to ask him about his tax arrangements.</p> <p>And then some of their lordships are so unassuming as they go about their work as to be almost invisible. Which brings us to the first of our awards, the <b> Mystery Prize for Entirely Inexplicable Promotion </b> , which could easily have gone to Lord Birt, a bespectacled man formerly connected with the BBC. Tony Blair, unlike many of Lord Birt's former employees, discerned some talent in this devotee of management consultants. In July Blair appointed Birt his new \"crime tsar\", \"tasked\" (to adopt placemanspeak) with advising on the long-term causes of crime. The reason Birt does not win the prize is that we have no idea whether he is advising well or badly. To date, there has been no word of Birt's progress whatsoever. There were unconfirmed rumours of a lunch-date with the former Tory home secretary. After that, nothing. Some say he is still awaiting reports from his consultants. Others that he has gone undercover, the better to inform himself on his area of expertise. Either way, anyone who believes that the best peer is an invisible peer will surely welcome Lord Birt's outstanding contribution to 21st-century Britain.</p> <p>Instead, the Mystery prize goes to Lord Matthew Evans, the publisher, who, despite having no discernible expertise or experience in the field of museums, was appointed chairman of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Commission. In his first utterance in the post, he accused his audience of museum curators of being, among many undesirable things, regressive, isolationist, and in danger of becoming \"cultural versions of Marks and Spencer . . .\" Well done, Lord Evans!</p> <p>As Lord Evans discovered, placemanship can be a hard row to hoe, a theme which was movingly explored this year by Lord Bragg, who made a plea for enhanced pay and conditions for working peers such as himself. As \"the 19th-century mills of Lancashire are to silicon valley\", he pointed out to a Houseful of weeping colleagues, \"so are the conditions of your Lordship's House to the way the 21st century really conducts its business\". Perhaps, he ventured, if these put-upon operatives of the legislative spinning jenny were paid more, they might be better respected. \"I am convinced that the quaint antiquity of our remuneration is part of the reason that, in the public eye, your Lordship's House receives less respect than its achievements merit.\"</p> <p>And if, as he suggested, there were \"more and better phones, faxes, e-mails, privacy . . . message systems\", then - who knows - perhaps his young colleague, the millionaire Lord Alli, might not have to use the House as a business address in any of his future advertisements for dot.com employees?</p> <p>In fairness, however, the <b> Luvvie Award for Closer Links between Government and Showbiz</b> must go to Lord Puttnam, who now devotes himself to helping the teaching profession, not least through the presentation of \"education Oscars\" for especially deserving pedagogues. But Lord Puttnam, who left school at 16, does not forget the runners-up, exhorting them to \"develop a more enlightened attitude to the manner in which you are perceived by the public\", suggesting that they take advice on performance from actors, and, most memorably, declaring that \"you can't bully people into doing good work. You can love them into doing it.\"</p> <p>Unless those people happen to be MPs, about whom Lord Puttnam recently had some uncharacteristically harsh things to say. \"I have to say, the percentage of those who are fine people is depressingly slender,\" he said this year. \"I often wonder whether the problem of Britain isn't in the failure of imagination in their elected representatives. A lot of them suffer from poverty of imagination.\"</p> <p>Had Lord Puttnam not amply earned himself the above award, he would certainly have won another, for <b> Best Placeperson's Coat of Arms </b> , having favoured a badge flanked by two birds. \"There was no device to represent my career in film so I persuaded them to put celluloid collars on the stork and the curlew,\" he said, imaginatively. Instead the award goes to Baroness Rendell of Babergh, who chose to feature polar bears.</p> <p>Lord Levy, whose crest shows three trumpet bells, symbolising his career in the music business, wins our <b> Prudence Award</b> <b> for Showing the Rest of Us How To Live Well on Limited Means </b> . When the news broke that this former donor, previously thought to be very rich indeed, had paid only \u00a35,000 in tax in 1998-99, the same as someone earning the national average salary of \u00a321,000 a year, the life peer put out a statement explaining that he had earned nothing during that year: \"I was living off my own savings on which all tax owing had been paid.\"</p> <p>Another millionaire, the economist Gavyn Davies, wins the <b> Placeperson's Award for Superhuman Objectivity </b> . After he was appointed vice chairman of the BBC, the government stressed that the economist had not been involved in any important political activity in the past five years. His wife works for Gordon Brown, at whose wedding Davies' daughter Rosie and son Ben served as bridesmaid and pageboy. In fact, the award would have gone to Lord Winston, the working peer who criticised Labour's health policies, pointing out the superiority of the Polish health service, had he not immediately retracted his comments after pressure from Alastair Campbell, earning himself, instead, the award for <b> Doormat of the Year </b> .</p> <p>No such indecision surrounded our next award, the <b> Marie Antoinette </b> , which went instantly to Baroness Margaret Jay, the closest thing Labour possesses to a hereditary peeress. The difficulty lay in choosing her most egregiously ill-chosen comments. Should it be her claim to having attended a \"fairly standard\" grammar? Her advice to the less fascinatingly employed on the joys of the wonderful world of work? In the end, it had to be that \"little cottage\" which has afforded her so many insights, of a weekend, into the rural way of life.</p> <p>The only possible competition had come, inevitably, from Lord Falconer, who regretted having caused such inconvenience, last year, to \"VIPs and ordinary people\". But since Lord Falconer's greatest achievement is his staying power, despite a year's plebeian clamour for his resignation, the only suitable award must be the <b> Elastoplast</b> <b> for Steadfast Defiance of the World's Non-Placemen </b> .</p> <p>Even Dame Helena Shovelton, who could genuinely see no reason to step down despite having been convicted of \"conspicuous unfairness\" in choosing a lottery regulator, could take lessons in indifference from Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who so far from suffering from his unpopularity, is tipped to be promoted still further by his friend and creator, that great egalitarian, hammer of privilege and herald of a new age, Tony Blair.</p>",

His wife works for Gordon Brown, at whose wedding Davies' daughter Rosie and son Ben served as bridesmaid and pageboy. In fact, the award would have gone to Lord Winston, the working peer who criticised Labour's health policies, pointing out the superiority of the Polish health service, had he not immediately retracted his comments after pressure from Alastair Campbell, earning himself, instead, the award for Doormat of the Year . No such indecision surrounded our next award, the Marie Antoinette , which went instantly to Baroness Margaret Jay, the closest thing Labour possesses to a hereditary peeress. The difficulty lay in choosing her most egregiously ill-chosen comments. Should it be her claim to having attended a \"fairly standard\" grammar? Her advice to the less fascinatingly employed on the joys of the wonderful world of work? In the end, it had to be that \"little cottage\" which has afforded her so many insights, of a weekend, into the rural way of life. The only possible competition had come, inevitably, from Lord Falconer, who regretted having caused such inconvenience, last year, to \"VIPs and ordinary people\". But since Lord Falconer's greatest achievement is his staying power, despite a year's plebeian clamour for his resignation, the only suitable award must be the Elastoplast for Steadfast Defiance of the World's Non-Placemen . Even Dame Helena Shovelton, who could genuinely see no reason to step down despite having been convicted of \"conspicuous unfairness\" in choosing a lottery regulator, could take lessons in indifference from Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who so far from suffering from his unpopularity, is tipped to be promoted still further by his friend and creator, that great egalitarian, hammer of privilege and herald of a new age, Tony Blair.",

As Muslims worldwide celebrated Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Islam's holiest month, clerics also urged Muslims to send zakat (alms) to the Palestinians. In Mecca, the imam of Masjid al-Haram, Islam's most holy site, declared that \"the tragic events\" in the Palestinian territories - where 350 people, mainly Arabs, have been killed in the past three months - were a \"source of sorrow to every Arab, Muslim and fair minded person in the world\". \"The Jewish invaders have violated the forbidden, desecrated the sacred and usurped our land in Palestine while the whole world has stood idle,\" Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Sabeel said in a sermon after the Eid prayers. In Cairo, the imams who led millions of worshippers in mosques and city squares asked that the traditional Eid alms be given to Palestinians who lost relatives in the uprising in Israel and the Palestinian territories. After prayers, Egyptians exchanged good wishes while some activists sold pictures of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem to raise funds for the Palestinians. Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told tens of thousands of worshippers gathered in and around a north Tehran mosque: \"It is a human, religious, wise and historical duty for all the Muslim nations to support the oppressed Palestinian nation as much as possible.\" Some hardliners responded with calls of \"Death to Israel! Death to America!\" The leader of the Sunni Muslims in Lebanon, Sheikh Mohammed Rashid Kabbani, denounced Israel in his sermon, saying the intifada must continue \"until Palestine and Jerusalem are liberated from the foreigner Jewish enemy\". In a number of Middle Eastern countries, the festivities marking the end of Ramadan were subdued this year, while all over the West Bank and Gaza Palestinian families were mourning their dead.

      "bodyText": "Next year Tony Blair faces the loneliest choice a British prime minister ever makes. He has to decide whether to go ahead with the expected general election this spring and, if so, exactly when. Or should he opt for caution and postpone it until early June, October or even as late as June 2002? By modern standards he still enjoys an astonishing dominance in the opinion polls, 10% ahead in this month's Guardian/ICM poll, a 13.1% lead according to Gallup in the Daily Telegraph, the latter figure almost exactly the percentage lead which delivered Labour's extraordinary 179-seat landslide on May 1 1997. The government's protracted honeymoon ended in 1999 amid familiar problems over jobs, crime, ministerial squabbles, the NHS, road and rail chaos, the dome. Not even baby Leo's arrival prevented the healthy onset of political mortality. Mr Blair is no longer as trusted as he was. Yet William Hague, fighting his first leader's election (as is Charles Kennedy), seems unable to profit more than briefly from Labour's discomfort. His populist forays on asylum, on Europe and even the murder of Damilola Taylor strike an uneasy note, even among many Tories. To survive as Tory leader with a chance of victory in 2005-6, Mr Hague knows he must cut Labour's lead to below 100. He must also quash Liberal Democrat pretensions to be Labour's near-permanent, shot-calling progressive partner. Labour ought to be brimming with confidence. Yet there is unease. Every minister knows that the three centre-left landslides of the 20th century - 1906, 1945, 1966 - collapsed entirely or were hamstrung at the next election. Has Labour done enough to prevent mass abstentions or defections next time round? With probably just a few months to go, the Guardian has tested the water in two key marginals which Mr Hague must win to survive, let alone be prime minister. He still has a long way to go.",

We could be in French Guyana, the most recent addition to McDonald's prolific empire, or Kuwait, or Russia. It is only when you spot a small sign on the wall that you realise this is India. It reads: \"No beef or beef products sold at this restaurant.\"</p> <p>Four years after arriving in Delhi and Bombay, McDonald's is poised to launch a massive expansion programme in India, its last great frontier. There are plans to expand the existing 24 restaurants to 80.</p> <p>That McDonald's has come here at all seems curious. The subcontinent, after all, has revered the cow for thousands of years. The creatures are everywhere in India - on traffic humps, grazing in rubbish dumps, in temples - everywhere, that is, except on your plate. To give an idea of how highly the animal is revered, nobody thought it odd when, earlier this month, 634 cows, en route to a slaughterhouse in Muslim Bangladesh, were rescued from a train by animal rights activists. The sight of naked Hindu saints holding pro-cow rallies is not unusual.</p> <p>McDonald's, by contrast, is the world's largest user of beef. Hundreds of thousands of animals have died since Ray Kroc, McDonald's founder, first opened a modest burger parlour in Des Plaines, Illinois, back in 1955. From humble beginnings in the US, Kroc set out on an epic voyage of expansion that was to take McDonald's into 119 countries, sweeping aside barriers of ideology, language and taste. But in recent years there has been resistance to his global vision from, for example, the two London Greenpeace activists who took on McDonald's in Britain's longest ever libel trial; high-street conscious Hampstead residents; and concerned environmentalists around the world.</p> <p>As the stand-off between anti-globalists and multinationals continues, India has become the last great battleground. If McDonald's can succeed here, without beef, it can succeed anywhere, so the reasoning goes. To woo customers, McDonald's has devised a unique marketing strategy. India is the only country in the world where McDonald's does not offer beef. With 140m Indian Muslims, pork is off the menu, too. This leaves chicken and mutton - the ingredient of McDonald's flagship \"Maharaja Mac\". There are other additions to the menu specifically designed to lure India's middle-class - such as the tantalising McAloo Tikki burger. All foods are strictly segregated into vegetarian and non-vegetarian lines. Even the mayonnaise has no egg in it, so as not to offend India's vegan sensibilities.</p> <p>Sitting in a first-floor office, incongruously decorated with Hindu friezes and posters of the ever-grinning Ronald McDonald, Vikram Bakshi - McDonald's managing director in India - admits that beef had been a \"complete no-no\" from the start. \"We have to be sensitive to the culture here. No beef and no pork. We are absolutely politically correct. The point is to be commercially viable. Using beef would take us away from 80% of our customers.\"</p> <p>McDonald's had been drawn to India because of its huge potential market of 1,000 million people, he says. Bakshi points with pride to the new McDonald's on the road between Delhi and Agra, which allows customers to munch Maharaja Macs en route to the Taj Mahal. More branches in north India will follow, he says.</p> <p>But Indian critics complain that McDonald's food is \"bad\", \"expensive\" and, well, \"unIndian\". They also allege that McDonald's - together with other fast-food outlets that arrived in the mid-90s, is losing money. \"India has a very ancient food culture. We are not going to change to American patterns of consumption. McDonald's will never become part of mass culture in India because most people can't afford to eat there,\" says Dr Vandana Shiva, director of the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology. People in India are gradually \"waking up\" to the threat posed by foreign multinationals, including Monsanto, to traditional methods of farming and ecology, she adds.</p> <p>India's fledgling fast-food industry has been keeping a low profile because of such opposition. Five years ago, Kentucky Fried Chicken found its new restaurant in the eminently westernised city of Bangalore under siege from farmers and anti-globalisation protesters. Customers had been staying away too - put off by what they regarded as high prices and inedible food. The mob ended up vandalising the restaurant. A hundred people were arrested. KFC eventually abandoned India altogether. \"India is no Thailand, where we could create the Kentucky magic within two years of operations,\" its former MD in India, Sandeep Kohli, conceded. \"We closed because the economics didn't work out.\"</p> <p>Many of the multinationals that came to India following liberalisation in the early 90s made the same mistake as KFC. They overestimated the size of India's middle class. It is around 100 million - though the figure of 200 million is often bandied about. And it is discerning. Domino's Pizza, McDonald's, TGI Fridays and others discovered to their horror that their new restaurants were rarely full. They embarked on a desperate round of price cuts. A Big Mac lamb wonder today sells for the lowly sum of 19 rupees (30p), while the cost of a Domino's pizza with cheese toppings has plunged from 90 rupees (\u00a31.40) to 49 rupees (75p). This has not deterred other aspirational entrants to the market: Pizza Express, the British chain, recently opened its second Delhi restaurant.

In neighbouring Japan, which was assimilated into the Kroc empire 30 years ago, there are more than 3,000 branches of McDonald's.</p> <p>There are few countries in Asia where McDonald's has yet to penetrate. To avoid the chain entirely you would have to go somewhere really remote: Afghanistan, perhaps, with its landmines, civil war and Islamic fundamentalism.

She added that the MCA had \"previously attracted high-calibre candidates from industry\", including its chief executive, Keith Jones. Dr Jones was formerly a director of Merck, Sharpe and Dohme Rahway in the United States. But there will be concerns over the appointment among consumer groups and those who are critical of the MCA's secretive ways of operating. Although the MCA claims to be moving towards greater openness, few details have been divulged about evidence given that has meant approval or otherwise for drug licences. The agency argues that the data it sees from clinical trials are commercially sensitive and must be kept secret to assure protection from competitors to the companies developing the drugs. The MCA makes its decisions following advice from the committee on safety of medicines, a group comprising doctors and scientists, the majority of whom have links to the drugs industry in the form of research grants, consultancies or other financial support. All members of the CSM are asked to declare both personal interests in drug companies, such as shares or fees, and non-personal interests, such as funding for clinical trials. Any member with a personal financial interest is expected to leave the room when the CSM starts to discuss drugs connected with the company involved. Critics say, however, that the problem runs deeper than personal interests because most of the scientists are steeped in a culture which does not tend to question the drugs industry.

      "bodyText": "The elder son of the late French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand will stay in jail for at least another five days while the police continue to investigate his alleged involvement in money laundering and illegal arms dealing. A Paris appeal court accepted the public prosecutor's argument yesterday that the case against Jean-Christophe Mitterrand would be better served if he stayed in jail for the time being, and postponed its ruling on his request for bail until January 2 at the earliest. Mr Mitterrant's lawyer, Jean-Pierre Versini-Campinchi, denounced the decision as a politically motivated attempt to discredit the Mitterrand family and said his client was \"morally burned out\" by the dishonour of his imprisonment, which he was at a loss to understand. \"There is nothing in the file, nothing at all,\" he said. \"If his continued imprisonment is justified, we should be told why. There is no evidence whatsoever at this stage that would allow him to be detained.\" Mr Mitterrand, who as head of the Elys\u00e9e Palace's secretive \"Africa cell\" from 1986-1992 was his father's chief adviser on African affairs, was jailed last week on suspicion of influence peddling, complicity in arms trafficking and abuse of funds. The potential charges relate to sales of Russian arms and military equipment to Angola in the early 1990s. The illicit deals, worth \u00a3350m, were allegedly put together by Brenco International, a company run by the French businessman Pierre Falcone, who was jailed on December 1 on suspicion of illegal arms dealing. Investigators claim that Mr Mitterrand's privileged contacts with African leaders were crucial to these deals, and possibly several more, and say that Brenco paid \u00a31.3m into his numbered Swiss bank account in the late 1990s. Mr Mitterrand has denied knowledge of any arms deals, saying the money was his reward for legitimate consultancy work which helped Brenco to help President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos's government in Angola borrow money on the world market against future oil income. Mr Versini-Campinchi said his client had \"arranged introductions\" for Mr Falcone in Angola which allowed him \"to exchange contracts relating to inter-governmental bank loans for oil\". He added: \"This type of operation is worth billions of dollars and leads to certain commissions.\" Angola has been devastated since its independence from Portugal in 1975 by a civil war between Mr Dos Santos's leftwing MPLA and Jonas Savimbi's Unita movement, which was backed for 15 years by the US and the South African apartheid regime. An estimated 92% of Angola's national income comes from crude oil production. The lack of transparent accounting means there is no way of knowing exactly how much money is involved, or how it is spent, and allegations of kickbacks, corruption and theft by high-ranking officials are rife. Some observers believe the oil-for-arms scam allegedly set up with Mr Mitterrand's help by Mr Falcone and his supposed associate Arkadi Gaidamak, a Russian businessman currently wanted under an international arrest warrant, is still in place. Simon Taylor of Global Witness, a British NGO which has studied Angola in depth, believes at least one firm with a stake in Angolan oil may have links with Mr Falcone and Mr Gaidemak, both of whom are said to have been given Angolan citizenship. Mr Mitterrand's arrest has come as yet another blow to his father's deteriorating reputation in France. In an unusually hard-hitting editorial, Le Monde said last week that the secret deals hatched in the Elys\u00e9e under Mr Mitterrand and others - and carried out in a complete legal vacuum - were \"a disgrace for France and for Africa\".",

      "body": "<p>We expected the future, but it feels like the past: as yet, I am still not sure whether I have yet seen any truly 21st-century art. I guess I was looking for something futuristic, preferably with fins, gizmos and telepathic auras. Instead, I think it was a patch of light on a glass in a Chardin painting and a film of Steve McQueen playing with his nipple that really got to me. </p> <p>The year 2000 was a year of buildings: the opening of the small but perfectly formed New Art Gallery in Walsall, refurbishments for the National Portrait Gallery, Dulwich Picture Gallery and the British Museum, and the opening, in May, of Tate Modern. This last, surely, was the most significant art event in Britain in 2000. </p> <p>One snooty American commentator - Jed Perl - decried what he saw as the confusion of Tate Modern, and how hard it was for the public to actually find their way beyond the Turbine Hall into the galleries themselves. Well, upwards of 3m people have made it to the Claude Monet-meets-Richard Long moment, around the Fluxus fun-zone and into the minimalist hardware area, though some might find it odd that all that industrially fabricated metal is in the portion of the Tate devoted to the body. Yet a glance at the walls themselves, the heel scuffs and bum-marks, provide proof that lots of sweaty, grubby bodies have indeed been here. </p> <p>Tate Modern has several problems, not the least being the sheer numbers that pass through it every day. It is always showtime. Behind the scenes, we hear of curators run ragged, of too much expected of too few, disaffection and machinations in the vault. At Tate Britain, the mix-and-match hang is a disaster. Playing games with history, with genres and movements can work, but only if there's a genuine point to be made. It also needs to be done with a sensitive eye. Curatorship and scholarship in an art museum need to be allied with an acute visual sense - which involves, among other things, a sensitivity to space and placement, to visual rhymes and contrasts, and an acute appreciation of what happens when you juxtapose one thing with another, and how oppositions and alignments and changes in scale and material generate new meanings all their own. Too many curators can't deal with this, even though they like to think of themselves as working on equal terms with artists. Which is precisely why they're not. </p> <p>I remain unashamed at shedding a tear outside Tate Modern on opening night last May. It wasn't just the drink, or the hilarity of a surreal moment when Tony Blair's bodyguards got tangled up with Yoko Ono's designer minders, and the surgically improved French artist Orlan wandered oblivious - with her budding horns implanted in her forehead - through the melee. It felt for a moment there as if the opening of Tate Modern signified the centrality of contemporary art to British culture in a way it that had never been acknowledged before. London felt like a big important European city, and one with high cultural ambitions. That night felt like a vindication. But maybe it was only the drink after all; buildings and parties are one thing, looking at art another. </p> <p>Some of the best shows I have seen in 2000 aren't tractable to the oversimplifications of the explanatory wall panel or a neat little curatorial theme. Close to Tate Modern, in the Delfina project space, Turner prize-winner Steve McQueen showed an alarming film that focused entirely on the artist's fingers and thumb tweaking and pulling at his tit, which filled the screen. Why was this so compelling, such an extraordinary work? I wrote about it, at some length, at the time, but still its meaning - in part undeniably erotic, but certainly not only so - remains elusive. It is a work which refuses to be contained, or killed, by its interpreters. It was a work that didn't illustrate anything, didn't have a message, but that had all sorts of unexpected resonances. </p> <p>The same can be said of the Royal Academy's Chardin exhibition. For all that focus on dead game, and still lifes of objects which have little intrinsic interest in themselves, Chardin is still elusive, breathtaking, disquieting and moving. It isn't even a matter of his undeniable skill and perspicacity as a painter, so much as it is that sense of unerring focus, an almost fixated contemplation of the world revealed by light, of degrees of opacity and transparency, which his paintings declare. And when he painted people - including himself - they were invariably people in that same state of hesitancy, contemplation, of a kind of irreducible being, that the painter evinced through the act of painting. What complex paintings he made, and without recourse to steamy subject matter, flashiness, appeal to fashion or this or that issue, gridlocked by theory. </p> <p>Every year, the Turner prize manages to garland itself with just the above qualities, yet the feeling was that the show was a trifle dull this year. The new Euro-Turner - the Vincent, held in Maastricht - was a much more intelligent, if low-key exhibition. The only British-based artist, Oladele Ajiboye Bamgboye, was the youngest in the shortlist, yet there was a genuine sense that the line-up (which also included Luc Tuymans, Karsten Holler, Miroslaw Balka, Eija-Liisa Ahtila and Pedro Cabrita Reis) had all achieved a level of artistic maturity and individuality which made the question of who should win irrelevant. It was a serious show of serious art. Maybe it wasn't sexy enough. </p> <p>At least this year's Turner, with three foreign contenders, acknowledged the fact that art is intellectually - as well as commercially - international. I hate the bolstering of Britishness, however good some British artists are, even though we've all got to come from somewhere. Good for Wolfgang Tillmans, too, for delivering the only elegant speech I have ever heard from a Turner winner. The context, however, is bigger than these islands, and the continuing vitality of current Britart depends on its dialogues with elsewhere, even if - like Richard Billingham, whose work couldn't be closer to home - one's subject is determinedly local. </p> <p>As a dialogue with elsewhere, and with history, Rachel Whiteread's Holocaust Memorial, finally unveiled last month after five and a half years of wrangling and Austrian intrigues, demonstrated that art does have a place in the moral consciousness, and that modern art, like the art of the past, has a place in the world. And that it can have dignity, reserve, and a kind of endurance. Like Lutyens' Cenotaph, it is a kind of locus for feelings and beliefs, even if we aren't always sure what those feelings are, what beliefs we ought to have.</p>",

This went to the Diary for its stewardship of Corniche Convertible RR1. Within 30 minutes of getting the \u00a3250,000 car in Crewe, I had broken the cassette player. An hour later, I drove it into the wall of a Leeds car park.</p> <p>Returning to London on the M1, finally, I put the engine into reverse at 90. By way of revenge, the RR press office limited itself to dobbing me to the police when the speeding ticket reached Crewe (the second ticket of the year following an earlier effort in a BMW).</p> <p>\u0095 <b>When Taki-George</b> bought a bunch of red grapes to the table, Dr Liam Fox was reminded of a joke: a man with terrible piles is told by his friend to pack tea leaves around his bottom, but when this fails he goes to the doctor (a man Liam portrayed as having a Peter Sellers comedy Indian accent). The doctor examines him very closely and does some tutting. \"I'm very sorry I can't do anything for your piles,\" he tells him, \"but you're going on a long journey.\"</p> <p>\u0095 <b>It was at this stage </b>that matters moved out of hand again. The Rev Steve Chalke, an Anglo-Indian who runs a large charity on the sub-continent, took offence at this gag and lapsed into some startlingly unChristian language. Another break was enforced before Dr Fox made his customary apology and we reconvened to decide the remaining awards, news of which will be here tomorrow.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Paul Johnson recalled the BBC dinner party at which Mr Tony's adviser on European policy announced that the government had no European policy at all. Later, when asked about rumours of tension between Mr T and Gordon Brown, Roger snorted and said they loathed each other like poison. The rest of the panel agreed with my sane and rational friend, so hats off Roger! \u0095 The panel was split over Letter of the Year. Rizla Rosie Boycott, giggling alarmingly and sending Taki-George out for a family size bar of Whole Nut, proposed Michael Henderson for his \"capacious arse\" letter to me. Although Paul Johnson agreed, Hendo settled for second place again (he was runner up in the soothsaying category) when Rev Steve and Liam Fox supported Barbara Roche's nomination. Peter Hain wins for the letter to the editor savaging our claim that he had \"blocked\" a humanitarian flight to Iraq on the grounds that he had in fact \"placed it on hold\". \u0095 There was no dispute over the Andrew Ridgeley Silver Shuttlecock for Motoring. This went to the Diary for its stewardship of Corniche Convertible RR1. Within 30 minutes of getting the \u00a3250,000 car in Crewe, I had broken the cassette player. An hour later, I drove it into the wall of a Leeds car park. Returning to London on the M1, finally, I put the engine into reverse at 90. By way of revenge, the RR press office limited itself to dobbing me to the police when the speeding ticket reached Crewe (the second ticket of the year following an earlier effort in a BMW). \u0095 When Taki-George bought a bunch of red grapes to the table, Dr Liam Fox was reminded of a joke: a man with terrible piles is told by his friend to pack tea leaves around his bottom, but when this fails he goes to the doctor (a man Liam portrayed as having a Peter Sellers comedy Indian accent). The doctor examines him very closely and does some tutting. \"I'm very sorry I can't do anything for your piles,\" he tells him, \"but you're going on a long journey.\" \u0095 It was at this stage that matters moved out of hand again. The Rev Steve Chalke, an Anglo-Indian who runs a large charity on the sub-continent, took offence at this gag and lapsed into some startlingly unChristian language. Another break was enforced before Dr Fox made his customary apology and we reconvened to decide the remaining awards, news of which will be here tomorrow. diary@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>The blade caught the morning sun. Despite the gloom beneath the bridge, I'd seen enough to know that it was at least the size of a carving knife. This man meant business. Even though we were on the other side of the river talking with other homeless men, he had clearly decided he was going to see to us. With a roar he grabbed his old bicycle, charged up the embankment and headed straight for us.</p> <p>There was a block of flats a few hundred yards away. Our film crew of four split up, and headed for different stairwells. Four floors up Mayu, a Japanese journalist working with us, was hammering on doors begging to be let in. The crazed knife wielder was closing in.</p> <p>As suddenly as he had come after us, he disappeared. We sneaked down the hallways and out on to the street again. In seconds he was back - but this time he had the police with him. An amazing sight, here was a dishevelled vagrant, ordering first two, then three, then five, and finally eight policemen to arrest us. And arrest us they did. Two squad cars, and even the superintendent's limo attended the scene.</p> <p>Our first night in Kyoto was spent in the cells. In the chaos of our arrest, Mayu had become separated, so that only the three white men of our team found themselves behind bars. The complainant arrived, still on his bicycle, but with no knife, about 10 minutes after our arrest.</p> <p>Our lingually-challenged confinement and eventual release lasted three and a half hours, and occupied the attention of all eight of the arresting officers. There is little crime in Kyoto, but there is much homelessness. Yet even the homeless have powers when foreigners come to call. They may have no social security, but they can still make a citizen's arrest.</p> <p>Somehow, you don't expect this rich, successful, country to sport rows of cardboard box homes with desolate hungry men and women beneath every span in town. Ten bridges in Kyoto, 10-20 beneath each - I suppose we met at least 200 homeless people, and there were clearly many more that that. It is a new phenomenon that has hit a society that has almost no provision for coping. For pride is the Japanese watchword and nothing assaults pride so much as the loss of everything else, hence the ire and fury that accompanied the threatening blade beneath the city's most westerly road bridge over the Kamog river.</p> <p>Japan is in unreported trouble. Sure, the statistics reveal little more than 0% growth for the past 10 years, a massaged 1.5% this past six months that has already dribbled to nothing. But they tell you nothing of the precipice this country is hurtling toward.</p> <p>Back under the next bridge, Hajime Tanaka, slurped tea. He had run a small business, lost it, lost his wife and his three children, and now he had lost his home. His pride, like his dirty white gloves, was still just about intact as he scoured the river banks for cans. He can make \u00a37 a day selling them in a country where the average wage is \u00a3500 a week.</p> <p>Takashi Matsuta is only a fraction luckier. A kimono weaver, his breathtakingly fine woven wasteband lies on the table in front of his loom in the upstairs room of a sweatshop. He earns no money, but is kept by the factory owner, a distant cousin. The bottom has fallen out of the Kimono industry.</p> <p>We were travelling the Tokaido Way - the old 400-mile imperial route that led from the former capital to Tokyo. Travelling in a G7 economic powerhouse, an industrial miracle maker - the birthplace of my hi-fi, my microwave, my television, even the Walkman on my belt - yet now an undiscussed disaster on its knees. Even so, we don't know it, and many of them don't either. We had been sent here to find out if the recession was over, if Japan was coming back.</p> <p>The dense elongated concrete coastal sprawl that spawned Japan's success still feels prosperous, the trains run, the neon flashes and the cranes sprout above the skyline. But, like the white gloves of the homeless scavenger, appearances in Japan are deceptive. Beyond the convenience stores, the gambling halls and the noodle bars, there is an event taking place that dwarfs any postwar recession Britain has experienced.</p> <p>You can hear the factory in Hamatsu where Yamaha makes grand pianos long before you enter it. Infernal robotic fingers drum the keyboards for hours on end to see if they fall apart. It is strange to see so singular a thing as a concert grand in unfurnished rows of twenty. Four hundred people work here, four hundred jobs for life. Like all old Japanese businesses, Yamaha looks after its workforce from the cradle to the grave. Except that suddenly it can't. It has already laid off more than 1,000. The world's appetite for grand pianos is sated. Mayu sat at a \u00a37,700 grand and played sumptuous Schubert. Tears welled in the manager's eye. He knows there's a problem; I don't think the workforce does.</p> <p>Further along the Tokaido, as we arrived in Toyota, they announced the closure of its biggest superstore, Sogo, and another 20 elsewhere in Japan. Sogo is the heart of Toyota. The next day the country's second biggest life assurance company went belly up with debts of \u00a325bn.</p> <p>Have we hit a particularly unfortunate week in Japanese history, or is this business as usual?</p> <p>The Japanese bubble, when times were good, saw the Toyota car company so pressed for labour that Japanese migrants who had gone a century earlier to Brazil were encouraged to come home.</p> <p>Past the doomed Sogo store and up the hill we could hear the Saturday night partying as soon as we opened the car door. Inside there were entirely Japanese-looking people cavorting around doing the samba and the bossanova. Many of these \"returnees\" speak not a word of Japanese. The quiet, introverted, indigenous Japanese resent the bizarre bangs, crashes and whoops that accompany a good time for these people. The conflict has turned so tense that a police unit has been formed to bring the two communities together.</p> <p>Japan is ageing so fast that the UN estimates that 600,000 immigrant workers will be needed over the next couple of years to keep the place going even in a recession. Yet as the tension in Toyota shows, even their own forebears have a rough time. Traditional Japanese xenophobia is unlikely to take any more kindly to the Indians, Chinese and Vietnamese knocking at the country's door.</p> <p>The piledrivers, barge cranes and construction boats dominate the Takonome skyline. Out at sea they are building yet another multi million pound airport. Nobody needs it - the new, offshore Kyoto airport is just down the road. But the mayor, Seikoh Ishibiashi, has secured the deal as a means of boosting the local economy. The construction companies have already been prosecuted for paying wads of yens to local officials, who have got away with suspended sentences. The whole project is adding to the 700 trillion yen (\u00a34.3 trillion) national debt which leaves Japan the most indebted industrialised country in the world.</p> <p>So who's worried? Certainly not the upper political echelons; for them it's business as usual. Certainly not the managing dirctor of the telecom offshoot NTT DoCoMo. Keiji Tachikawa told me: \"Leave us alone for another 10 years and we'll fix it.\" Other, younger Japanese men and women are not so sanguine. Junichi Izumi is a young internet entrepreneur. Japanese does not fit well with the internet revolution and he is toiling against the stream. But he is convinced the old guard who run Japan don't even understand what it is. \"In the summer,\" he told me \"prime minister Mori kept calling the IT revolution the it revolution.\"</p> <p>The day we left Tokyo the minister of economic planning, Taichi Sakaiya, announced a \u00a364bn economic renewal programme. \"It's focused on IT,\" he told me. Closer inspection revealed still more construction projects. Sure, the new Tokyo sewerage system does have an IT element, sophiticated computer sensors for checking sewage levels. Japanese politicians, alas, appear to be subject to no such monitoring system.</p> <p>So why don't people talk about Japan's perilous economic state? Is it just too big to worry about, too far away, too impenetrable, too threatening to the global financial structures?</p> <p>As I was leaving the minister's office, another vast life assurance company, Kyoei, had just announced that it too was going bust with debts of \u00a330bn.</p> <p>\u0095 Snow in Japan is on Channel 4 on Saturday at 8pm</p>",

But he is convinced the old guard who run Japan don't even understand what it is. \"In the summer,\" he told me \"prime minister Mori kept calling the IT revolution the it revolution.\" The day we left Tokyo the minister of economic planning, Taichi Sakaiya, announced a \u00a364bn economic renewal programme. \"It's focused on IT,\" he told me. Closer inspection revealed still more construction projects. Sure, the new Tokyo sewerage system does have an IT element, sophiticated computer sensors for checking sewage levels. Japanese politicians, alas, appear to be subject to no such monitoring system. So why don't people talk about Japan's perilous economic state? Is it just too big to worry about, too far away, too impenetrable, too threatening to the global financial structures? As I was leaving the minister's office, another vast life assurance company, Kyoei, had just announced that it too was going bust with debts of \u00a330bn. \u0095 Snow in Japan is on Channel 4 on Saturday at 8pm",

Reuters, Manila Border patrol for African troops West African defence ministers and army chiefs met in the Nigerian capital Abuja yesterday to finalise plans to deploy troops along the borders of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone to prevent the region sliding into instability. The members of the Economic Community of West African States, including these three countries, were due to decide the size of the force and number of troops each country will contribute to their effort to quell the unrest which has displaced tens of thousands of refugees and local residents. AP, Abuja Toxic waste inquiry closed A Spanish judge ended an inquiry into Spain's worst environmental disaster yesterday, finding that the 25 people under investigation had no criminal responsibility. Nearly 7m cubic metres of toxic material from a mine near Seville owned by their company, Boliden Apirsa, contaminated a river, damaging surrounding farmland and killing thousands of fish and other wildlife.

Museums and galleries are expanding, public buildings are being spruced up after years of neglect, a theatre has come back into the limelight after three dark years, and the city's symphony orchestra is looking forward to a stable financial future under a new conductor. Much of the effort is concentrated in the heart of the city. Last week the Heritage Lottery Fund announced a \u00a310m grant towards a \u00a315m project to restore St George's Hall, one of the grandest public buildings in Britain. A week earlier, the Playhouse, the oldest continuously running rep theatre in Britain until it collapsed in debt in 1997, reopened with a critically acclaimed production of A Christmas Carol after a \u00a31.5m clean-up. The Liverpool Museum, Walker art gallery and Museum of Liverpool Life are being expanded and improved in a scheme costing almost \u00a334m and aided by a \u00a324m lottery grant, the second largest so far awarded to a museum project. The Philharmonic Hall has been refurbished and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Hall has received most of the \u00a35.8m it was promised under the Arts Council's stabilisation programme and is emerging from years of battling with debts. Gerard Schwarz, at present chief conductor of the Seattle Symphony, arrives as music director in September with plans for building audiences. In the area known as the Ropewalks, new media industries snuggle up against new private art galleries. \"All this should ensure that we are able to mount a full range of cultural activities if we are successful in our bid to become European capital of culture in 2008,\" said Peter Toyne, former vice chancellor of John Moores University and chair of the bid committee. \"Within one week, there has been good news about two of the city's greatest architectural and cultural assets.

Less than a year ago E-xentric was valued at \u00a370m. The company, a technology investment vehicle for Punch Taverns boss Hugh Osmond and a number of other well-known entrepreneurs, said it had scrapped plans to become an internet services group and was returning to its previous status of a cash shell. The announcement represents an about-turn for Mr Osmond and his partners in the venture, who included fellow PizzaExpress founder Luke Johnson, internet entrepreneur Charles Nasser and Edward Spencer-Churchill, son of the Duke of Marlborough. At the start of the year they announced a radical plan to cash in on booming demand for internet shares by transforming the stock market shell that once housed the Blakes Clothing menswear chain into a hi-tech investment company. Thousands of private investors made a frenzied dash for the shares as bulletin board postings talked of big deals ahead and the tiny firm's share price leapt in value by 18 times in a single day. However, as a more cautious approach towards investing in internet stocks developed over the year, E-xentric shares have fallen back from a high of 225p to around 12p. Mr Osmond and his partners are returning to the drawing board. A spokeswoman said: \"They have seen how conditions have changed and decided to cut their losses. \"A number of options with the objective of maximising shareholder value are now being considered,\" a statement added. E-xentric shares closed up at 13p. Under the terms of a complex deal, MCA Holdings, which was bought by E-xentric for \u00a312m in March, will be sold back to former owners Ian and Linda McAllister and Segun Ogunsheye for \u00a31. The three will return 15m of the 17m E-xentric shares they were given as part of the transaction but will retain an interest in E-xentric through various loans. E-xentric will be left with cash reserves of \u00a339m, which values the company at around 17p per share, the spokeswoman said. Most of the cash is left over from a \u00a340m fundraising in March. Mr Osmond is likely to use the shell to give another privately owned business a route on to the stock market. Early trading in E-xentric shares was reminiscent of the initial rush to buy into Knutsford, the bid vehicle for former Asda boss Archie Norman which a few months earlier had seen its shares jump from 9.5p to 150p in a day. It later abandoned ambitious plans to buy a retailer and instead purchased an online investor relations service. \u0095Job cuts at US dot.com firms rose 19% to a record high of 10,459 this month, according to figures released yesterday. Recruitment firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas said the previous record was November's 8,789 job losses. Since December 1999 Challenger has recorded 41,515 job cuts at 496 companies.

Mr Woodhead will be released from his contractual requirement to remain silent about his views and experiences at Ofsted next month, after his early departure from the job. He has indicated to friends that he plans to expose financial waste in education and Labour's resistance to the abolition of local education authorities. William Hague has been so keen to enlist the services of Mr Woodhead that his advisors have been pressing the Conservative leader to sack his shadow education secretary, Theresa May, and appoint Mr Woodhead in her place. That would depend on Mr Woodhead accepting a peerage, which Conservative Central Office is known to be keen on. The New Year's honours list is to be announced on Saturday, although the number of new peers may be curtailed by the government's plan that at least eight should be appointed following nominations from the public. Under the Tory plan, Mrs May would stay as education spokeswoman in the Commons, but Mr Woodhead would become the Tories' chief spokesman on education. Central Office believes the Conservatives are still failing to achieve a breakthrough on education and regards Mr Woodhead as the one man capable of quickly turning round the polls in Labour's strongest policy area. The education secretary, David Blunkett, has been praised for raising literacy and numeracy standards, but Mr Woodhead has told friends Mr Blunkett is excessively dependent on departmental advisors and is only implementing policy started by the Conservatives. Disagreements between Downing Street and the Department for Education which Mr Woodhead may expose centre on the role of the private sector in city academies and the tolerance given to Mr Woodhead to stray from his school inspections brief. Mr Woodhead has always insisted he is not a Tory, but in a recent interview backed Mr Hague's key education policies, including his ideas of \"free schools\" and the reduction of waste through abolition of local education authorities. He supports the Conservative proposal that local schools rather than a central bureaucracy should determine performance related pay. Mr Woodhead said: \"It is clear to everyone that successful headteachers want the freedom to manage their own destiny. Tory plans for more autonomous schools do chime with many in the profession.

      "bodyText": "John Prescott last night attempted to quell anger over a new wave of rail fare increases and demanded that train companies justify their decision to put up ticket prices as passengers face severe disruption. Passenger groups were furious at the above-inflation rises of up to 4.9% which come in on January 7, given that travellers have endured the worst disruption in the history of the British network. During a tour of Leeds station - where a \u00a3165m regeneration programme is seriously affecting services - the deputy prime minister said he had asked the strategic rail authority for a report into the increases. He also asked for a report into why more than 600 passengers were stranded at Stansted airport on Tuesday night because rail services ended at 7pm and there were no seats on coaches. Mr Prescott, who arrived at Leeds station by car, passed queues of passengers waiting for buses because many trains were not stopping at Leeds from today until January 1. Signalling work at the station meant passengers on lines to Wakefield, Huddersfield, Sheffield, Pontefract and the Calder Valley had to get buses to other stations. He said: \"It's certainly not integrated and it's not a good example if we want people to use an integrated transport system,\" he said. But he stressed: \"The regulated fares have had a reduction in prices. Many companies are able to offer cheap fares which are unregulated. Some have decided to freeze them, others have decided to increase them. \"I have asked the rail authority to give me a full report on it. I know it has caused a great deal of concern.\" The Capital Transport Campaign group said that under the fare-capping system every train operating company could increase commuter fares in 2001, even when their performance had become dramatically worse. The group is particularly incensed that the Silverlink company, which operates to north London and the Midlands out of Euston station, London, has put up prices by 4.3% despite finishing bottom in a recent customer satisfaction poll. First Great Eastern, which operates out of Liverpool Street station, London, to Essex and East Anglia, is raising some fares by 3.3%. \"This is a particularly insensitive time to impose a large price rise,\" said Brian Cooke, chairman of the rail passenger council's Great Eastern sub-committee. \"For passengers to pay an above-inflation rise at this time seems like a complete smack in the teeth. It is appalling.\" Rises at other companies include a 4.9% increase on some off-peak fares on South West Trains, a 3.3% increase on Connex peak fares, and 3.3% increases on Central Trains' off-peak tickets. Fares have been frozen by east coast operator GNER and by Virgin on its west coast main line and CrossCountry services. All these routes have been particularly badly hit by speed restrictions imposed after the Hatfield crash in October, in which four people died. The Liberal Democrats' transport spokesman, Don Foster, said the increases were \"the last straw\" and demanded government action against the rail companies. News of the fares hike came as airport officials launched an investigation after more than 600 Boxing Day travellers were stranded at London Stansted for several hours. An airport spokeswoman said rail services into London ended at 7pm and it was thought that coach firms would be able to handle passengers flying in after that time. By 9.30pm managers realised there was a major problem and organised extra coaches out of the airport. The coaches carried more than 600 people into central London, with the last one leaving at 1.30am. The spokeswoman said train operator West Anglia Great Northern had advertised the fact that Boxing Day services would end at 7pm well in advance. It is believed that around eight flights arrived at Stansted after 7pm from destinations including Glasgow, Rome and Stockholm. A spokeswoman for West Anglia Great Northern said information about the ending of the Stansted Express service at 7pm on Boxing Day had been put on the Internet, on posters, and the airlines and airport had been told. She added: \"The message didn't get through and we will be looking at that.\"",

The weather, though hardly a sophisticated bellwether for stock-picking, was about as technical as it got yesterday. Private investors dominated, as most fund managers took an extended Christmas break. </p> <p>A rally in telecom stocks helped push the FTSE 100 up a hefty 120.7 points to 6218.2, leaving behind Friday's seven-month closing low. </p> <p> <strong> Vodafone</strong> was the busiest stock amid thin volumes, rising 5.25p to 237.25p after a report that it could be planning a \u00a36.5bn bid for Cable &amp; Wireless's offshoot Optus, which is Australia's second largest mobile phones carrier. C&amp;W is keen to sell the business, as it concentrates on data communications, and any prospect of further global domination cheers Vodafone's followers. </p> <p> <strong> British Telecom</strong> rallied 2p to 579p as the market digested news of an investigation by the government's red tape basher, Lord Haskins. The Labour peer was giving few hints as to whether he is moving towards a relaxation of the regulatory environment, or imposition of fresh measures to create fair play in the industry. </p> <p>Few were prepared to extend seasonal goodwill to hi-tech stocks. Some traders muttered that the current phase of the internet sell-off could be reaching an end but there was little relief for the big players yesterday. <strong> Autonomy</strong> fell 26p to a new low of \u00a318.74, <strong> Bookham</strong> dropped 10p to 970p and <strong> Freeserve</strong> slipped 0.75p to 97.25p. </p> <p>Optimists suggested that private investors would be snapping up a few hi-tech bargains before the end of the year and there was a rare rally for software company <strong> Misys</strong>, up 46.5p to 661.5p. </p> <p>On the retail front, cautious optimism prevailed about seasonal till receipts, helped by a statement from Asda, which announced a 20% rise in sales in the week before Christmas. <strong> Tesco</strong> edged up 6.75p to 282.75p and <strong> Sainsbury</strong> increased 0.25p to 399.5p. Even <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> was in positive territory, up 3.5p to 192.5p despite unconfirmed reports of a further dive in takings. </p> <p>A clearer picture on the retail front is expected in the new year, as stores issue their crucial like-for-like trading figures. </p> <p> <strong> Bank of Scotland </strong> took a battering, down 5p to 707.5p with a relatively high volume of shares traded, as doubts surfaced about plans to merge with <strong> Abbey National</strong>. The banks are awaiting news from the Office of Fair Trading on their proposals, and one report yesterday suggested that Barclays could re-open talks with the Scottish bank should the deal fail. </p> <p>Amid sparse corporate activity, <strong> Retail Decisions</strong> concluded a deal to help BT Cellnet avoid credit card fraud. It will provide services to scrutinise orders for top-up cards on pre-paid phones. Retail Decisions jumped 9.5p to 127p. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Israeli technology firm <strong> Zen Research</strong> leapt 14p to 112.5p after saying it had signed a licensing agreement with a \"global manufacturer of electronic products\". Zen has a method of boosting the speed at which computers can read CD-Roms and DVDs. </p> <p>In the drugs sector, <strong> Glaxo SmithKline</strong> had a quiet opening, up 29p to \u00a318.77 on the first day of trading following the completion of its merger. <strong> Powderject Pharmaceuticals </strong> was more excited about the deal, up 51p to 561p on its hopes that the new industry leader would be interested in its needle-free method of administering vaccines.</p>",

Some traders muttered that the current phase of the internet sell-off could be reaching an end but there was little relief for the big players yesterday. Autonomy fell 26p to a new low of \u00a318.74, Bookham dropped 10p to 970p and Freeserve slipped 0.75p to 97.25p. Optimists suggested that private investors would be snapping up a few hi-tech bargains before the end of the year and there was a rare rally for software company Misys, up 46.5p to 661.5p. On the retail front, cautious optimism prevailed about seasonal till receipts, helped by a statement from Asda, which announced a 20% rise in sales in the week before Christmas. Tesco edged up 6.75p to 282.75p and Sainsbury increased 0.25p to 399.5p. Even Marks &amp; Spencer was in positive territory, up 3.5p to 192.5p despite unconfirmed reports of a further dive in takings. A clearer picture on the retail front is expected in the new year, as stores issue their crucial like-for-like trading figures. Bank of Scotland took a battering, down 5p to 707.5p with a relatively high volume of shares traded, as doubts surfaced about plans to merge with Abbey National. The banks are awaiting news from the Office of Fair Trading on their proposals, and one report yesterday suggested that Barclays could re-open talks with the Scottish bank should the deal fail. Amid sparse corporate activity, Retail Decisions concluded a deal to help BT Cellnet avoid credit card fraud. It will provide services to scrutinise orders for top-up cards on pre-paid phones. Retail Decisions jumped 9.5p to 127p. Meanwhile, Israeli technology firm Zen Research leapt 14p to 112.5p after saying it had signed a licensing agreement with a \"global manufacturer of electronic products\". Zen has a method of boosting the speed at which computers can read CD-Roms and DVDs. In the drugs sector, Glaxo SmithKline had a quiet opening, up 29p to \u00a318.77 on the first day of trading following the completion of its merger. Powderject Pharmaceuticals was more excited about the deal, up 51p to 561p on its hopes that the new industry leader would be interested in its needle-free method of administering vaccines.",

Stelios still owns 32% of the company. </p> <p>Ryanair's <strong> Mike O\"Leary </strong> battered BA in court. He had used adverts branding the UK flag carrier as \"expensive ba----ds\". BA took Ryanair to court, where Mr Justice Robin Jacob described the campaign as \"honest, comparative advertising\". </p> <p>Barclays Bank boss <strong> Matt Barrett</strong> hit the big time when it emerged he had a pay package that could deliver \u00a330m. Barclays was simultaneously diddling its customers out of a proper counter service by closing 170-odd branches. </p> <p>Freeserve and planet online founder <strong> Peter Wilkinson</strong> sold his 14-month-old Sports Internet to BSkyB for \u00a3301m just as all other valuations crashed. Wilkinson - an intensely-private, Ferrari-driving Leeds fan, who smokes roll-ups and guards his privacy jealously - is one of the UK's most successful internet entrepreneurs. He added yet more to his substantial fortune when Freeserve was sold to French rival Wanadoo - and is now doing very nicely with another venture InTechnology, a data warehousing operation. </p> <p><strong> Dr Mike Lynch</strong> had a triumphant homecoming with his Autonomy group. Two years ago the \"intelligent software\" group went for a listing on EASDAQ after being rejected by London as too risky. On its debut in London this year it went straight into the FTSE100 as a \u00a35.5bn company. Despite the rout in tech stocks it is still clinging on to its FTSE premier league status, with a stock market valuation of some \u00a32.7bn. </p> <p><strong> Bob the Builder</strong> hit No 1 and made HIT Entertainment one of the strongest performing media shares of the year. Bob, Scoop, Dizzy and Muck fixed it for the TV producer selling dumper-truck loads of merchandise worldwide. Bob is off to the US in the new year to give white rapper Eminem another kicking. </p> <p><strong> James Dyson</strong> cleaned up when he took rival Hoover to court for infringing his patent. Hoover were ordered to take every offending \"Triple Vortex\" appliance off the market. Mr Dyson now wants millions in damages. </p> <p><strong> Charles Allen</strong> gatecrashed the cosy little get-together planned by ITV's Carlton and United News &amp; Media. Their merger was thwarted and he picked up UN&amp;M's ITV franchises, winning the battle to dominate the network. </p> <p><strong> Tony Ball </strong> at BSkyB put subscriptions into overdrive after several years of zero growth, but then sent shareholders into a spin when he chose to cash in almost every share option he could get his hands on to bank nearly \u00a36m. BSkyB explained he needed the cash because he had financial commitments and a young family. </p> <p><strong> Sir Richard Branson </strong> could have won the licence to run the national lottery, but was instead rolled over by Camelot's <strong> Dianne Thompson</strong>. The diminutive single mum eclipsed \"Britain's favourite entrepreneur\" in the publicity battle. </p> <p>The <strong> Reichmann</strong> brothers were finally vindicated. Their Canary Wharf docklands development, which keeled over in 1992, is now the UK's biggest property company. </p> <p><strong> Michael</strong> and <strong> Yoel Zaoui</strong>, two Moroccan-born brothers, are said to have each banked \u00a320m in this year's round of City bonuses. Yoel heads European mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs. His brother does the same at rival bank Morgan Stanley. </p> <p>AIM-listed <strong> Yeoman</strong> , based in the delightful surroundings of Lymington Marina and manufacturer of marine navigational wizardry, is set to be the best performing stock in the market this year. Shares in January: 62p. Shares now: 610p. </p> <p><strong> Trevor Hemmings</strong> , 64, the entrepreneur who owns Blackpool Tower, Royal Windsor racecourse and Eastbourne Pier bought back Pontins from brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. He is also majority shareholder at Sportech, new owner of Littlewoods Pools. Its shares have rocketed from less than 5p twelve months ago to 27p. Last week he moved in on a more upmarket gambling business, snapping up 5% of ailing casino group London Clubs International, owner of high roller haunts like Les Ambassadeurs and the St James's club. </p> <p><strong> Carlos Ghosn</strong>, \"le costcutter\", has had a good year after being drafted in to turn round the struggling Nissan car company. His recovery programme is on track, but will the former Renault man let the Wearside plant build the new Micra? </p> <p>Germany's finance minister <strong> Hans Eichel</strong> has enjoyed the block-busting revenues from the sale of third generation mobile phone licences while his tax reform programme is opening the door to corporate restructuring in Germany. </p> <p><strong> In the red</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Durlacher Corporation</strong> took a dive in the dot.com rout. The internet financier was touted as a potential FTSE stock - but is now trading 90% off its peak value. Boss Geoffrey Chamberlain's stake has crashed in value by \u00a3300m. </p> <p><strong> Vauxhall's</strong> Luton carworkers were told they were surplus to requirements. </p> <p><strong> Alta Vista</strong> UK boss Andy Mitchell couldn't deliver unlimited internet access and his alta vista career came to an end. </p> <p>The <strong> canary</strong> is extinct. It is an ex-inflation indicator. The Italians always included canary prices in the basket of goods and services used to calculate Italian inflation. Now it has been given the bird and replaced by the motorcycle helmet. </p> <p><strong> Railtrack</strong> put the country's entire rail network on go-slow after it failed to mend a broken rail and the Hatfield crash claimed four lives. Chief executive Gerald Corbett offered to resign, eventually walked and pocketed some \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>Ernst Malmsten and Kajsa Leander, the photogenic founders of <strong> Boo.com</strong>, burned \u00a380m of investors' money and then went belly up as the highest profile dot bomb. Details in their book to follow. </p> <p>One million <strong> Equitable Life</strong> policyholders are facing big losses but 90,000 pensionholders now have a guaranteed annuity. </p> <p>BT boss<strong> Sir Peter Bonfield</strong> has been under fire as the group's share price has plunged more than 60% this year. </p> <p>The future was not bright for <strong> Orange </strong> boss Hans Snook. He lost out when Orange was bought by France Telecom. </p> <p><strong> QXL </strong> became the founder member of the UK branch of the 99% club - dot.com shares which have crashed in value by 99% this year. Once \u00a38, they now grub along at about 8p. </p> <p><strong> Don Cruickshank</strong>, friend of government and action man regulator, has seen his reputation destroyed after a series of blunders in his new role as the chairman of the London Stock Exchange. </p> <p><strong> C&amp;A </strong> called it a day and is going away. </p> <p>Internet service provider <strong> Breathe.com</strong> expired, taking \u00a330m of backer Martin Dawes' fortune with it. </p> <p><strong> John Hoerner</strong>, chief executive of the ailing retail group Arcadia and part-time top dog at Battersea Dog's Home, was fired. Mr Hoerner had presided over ballooning debt and an 80% share price dive in the last three years. </p> <p><strong> Jennie Page</strong>, the former Dome boss, lurched from crisis to crisis as a non-executive director of Railtrack and Equitable Life. </p> <p><strong> Bob Ayling</strong> - the man who fired Ms Page - was axed in her wake. He was then ditched as chief executive of BA. </p> <p><strong> Lord Hollick</strong> was unable to dominate ITV. His plan to merge his United News &amp; Media group with Carlton were blocked and he was lambasted for selling the Daily Express to a porn baron. </p> <p><strong> Tony Illsley</strong> of Telewest refused to take a second fiddle role in the merger with Flextech and jumped although his fall was cushioned with \u00a36m. </p> <p><strong> Wim Duisenberg</strong>, the head of the European Central Bank, now dubbed Dim Wim. Under his stewardship the value of the euro has been in virtual free fall for most of the year. Ill-judged - if logical - remarks about intervention did nothing to turn the tide in the forex market. </p> <p><strong> Elisabeth Murdoch</strong> conceded defeat in the succession battle at News Corp and quit the family firm. </p> <p><strong> David Elstein,</strong> who brought us X-rated terrestrial telly as the chief executive of Channel 5, was replaced by Dawn Airey. </p> <p><strong> Martha Lane Fox,</strong> the woman who epitomised the internet frenzy, went quiet. The flotation of her Lastminute.com group, founded with chum <strong>Brent Hoberman</strong>, marked the return to reality at the dot.com world of big plans and no profits. The shares hit 487p, but are now 78p. </p> <p>The <strong> BBC</strong> lost the rights to Match of the Day. </p> <p>Klaus Esser, the head of <strong> Mannesmann</strong>, lost Germany's biggest ever hostile bid battle. Vodafone's victory meant the dismemberment of the house that Klaus built as the UK group sold Mannesmann's traditional engineering operations as well as the Orange mobile phone operations. </p> <p>The biggest stockmarket faller this year is likely to be <strong> WILink</strong>, provider of online investment products and services. It was previously known as Knutsford, the company which was once tipped to take over Marks &amp; Spencer. It was backed by high profile property and retail businessmen Archie Norman, Nick Leslau, Nigel Wray and Julian Richer - known collectively as the \"awesome foursome\". </p> <p><strong> Alchemy</strong>, the venture capital firm headed by Jon Moulton, seemed certain to buy Rover from BMW until the Germans abruptly ditched their deal.

      "bodyText": "In the black Ginger whinger Chris Evans was quids in after selling Ginger Media Group to Scottish Media Group. He got \u00a375m when Ginger was sold for \u00a3225m - and SMG became the proud owner of shows that sounded good but bombed - like Red Alert and Lock, Stock and ... Thirty three-year-old Stelios Haji-Ioannou turned the easyJet airline he started with a \u00a35m loan from his dad into an \u00a3850m public company. Stelios still owns 32% of the company. Ryanair's Mike O\"Leary battered BA in court. He had used adverts branding the UK flag carrier as \"expensive ba----ds\". BA took Ryanair to court, where Mr Justice Robin Jacob described the campaign as \"honest, comparative advertising\". Barclays Bank boss Matt Barrett hit the big time when it emerged he had a pay package that could deliver \u00a330m. Barclays was simultaneously diddling its customers out of a proper counter service by closing 170-odd branches. Freeserve and planet online founder Peter Wilkinson sold his 14-month-old Sports Internet to BSkyB for \u00a3301m just as all other valuations crashed. Wilkinson - an intensely-private, Ferrari-driving Leeds fan, who smokes roll-ups and guards his privacy jealously - is one of the UK's most successful internet entrepreneurs. He added yet more to his substantial fortune when Freeserve was sold to French rival Wanadoo - and is now doing very nicely with another venture InTechnology, a data warehousing operation. Dr Mike Lynch had a triumphant homecoming with his Autonomy group. Two years ago the \"intelligent software\" group went for a listing on EASDAQ after being rejected by London as too risky. On its debut in London this year it went straight into the FTSE100 as a \u00a35.5bn company. Despite the rout in tech stocks it is still clinging on to its FTSE premier league status, with a stock market valuation of some \u00a32.7bn. Bob the Builder hit No 1 and made HIT Entertainment one of the strongest performing media shares of the year. Bob, Scoop, Dizzy and Muck fixed it for the TV producer selling dumper-truck loads of merchandise worldwide. Bob is off to the US in the new year to give white rapper Eminem another kicking. James Dyson cleaned up when he took rival Hoover to court for infringing his patent. Hoover were ordered to take every offending \"Triple Vortex\" appliance off the market. Mr Dyson now wants millions in damages. Charles Allen gatecrashed the cosy little get-together planned by ITV's Carlton and United News &amp; Media. Their merger was thwarted and he picked up UN&amp;M's ITV franchises, winning the battle to dominate the network. Tony Ball at BSkyB put subscriptions into overdrive after several years of zero growth, but then sent shareholders into a spin when he chose to cash in almost every share option he could get his hands on to bank nearly \u00a36m. BSkyB explained he needed the cash because he had financial commitments and a young family. Sir Richard Branson could have won the licence to run the national lottery, but was instead rolled over by Camelot's Dianne Thompson. The diminutive single mum eclipsed \"Britain's favourite entrepreneur\" in the publicity battle. The Reichmann brothers were finally vindicated. Their Canary Wharf docklands development, which keeled over in 1992, is now the UK's biggest property company. Michael and Yoel Zaoui, two Moroccan-born brothers, are said to have each banked \u00a320m in this year's round of City bonuses. Yoel heads European mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs. His brother does the same at rival bank Morgan Stanley. AIM-listed Yeoman , based in the delightful surroundings of Lymington Marina and manufacturer of marine navigational wizardry, is set to be the best performing stock in the market this year. Shares in January: 62p. Shares now: 610p. Trevor Hemmings , 64, the entrepreneur who owns Blackpool Tower, Royal Windsor racecourse and Eastbourne Pier bought back Pontins from brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle. He is also majority shareholder at Sportech, new owner of Littlewoods Pools. Its shares have rocketed from less than 5p twelve months ago to 27p. Last week he moved in on a more upmarket gambling business, snapping up 5% of ailing casino group London Clubs International, owner of high roller haunts like Les Ambassadeurs and the St James's club. Carlos Ghosn, \"le costcutter\", has had a good year after being drafted in to turn round the struggling Nissan car company. His recovery programme is on track, but will the former Renault man let the Wearside plant build the new Micra? Germany's finance minister Hans Eichel has enjoyed the block-busting revenues from the sale of third generation mobile phone licences while his tax reform programme is opening the door to corporate restructuring in Germany. In the red Durlacher Corporation took a dive in the dot.com rout. The internet financier was touted as a potential FTSE stock - but is now trading 90% off its peak value. Boss Geoffrey Chamberlain's stake has crashed in value by \u00a3300m. Vauxhall's Luton carworkers were told they were surplus to requirements. Alta Vista UK boss Andy Mitchell couldn't deliver unlimited internet access and his alta vista career came to an end. The canary is extinct. It is an ex-inflation indicator. The Italians always included canary prices in the basket of goods and services used to calculate Italian inflation. Now it has been given the bird and replaced by the motorcycle helmet. Railtrack put the country's entire rail network on go-slow after it failed to mend a broken rail and the Hatfield crash claimed four lives. Chief executive Gerald Corbett offered to resign, eventually walked and pocketed some \u00a3500,000. Ernst Malmsten and Kajsa Leander, the photogenic founders of Boo.com, burned \u00a380m of investors' money and then went belly up as the highest profile dot bomb. Details in their book to follow. One million Equitable Life policyholders are facing big losses but 90,000 pensionholders now have a guaranteed annuity. BT boss Sir Peter Bonfield has been under fire as the group's share price has plunged more than 60% this year. The future was not bright for Orange boss Hans Snook. He lost out when Orange was bought by France Telecom. QXL became the founder member of the UK branch of the 99% club - dot.com shares which have crashed in value by 99% this year. Once \u00a38, they now grub along at about 8p. Don Cruickshank, friend of government and action man regulator, has seen his reputation destroyed after a series of blunders in his new role as the chairman of the London Stock Exchange. C&amp;A called it a day and is going away. Internet service provider Breathe.com expired, taking \u00a330m of backer Martin Dawes' fortune with it. John Hoerner, chief executive of the ailing retail group Arcadia and part-time top dog at Battersea Dog's Home, was fired. Mr Hoerner had presided over ballooning debt and an 80% share price dive in the last three years. Jennie Page, the former Dome boss, lurched from crisis to crisis as a non-executive director of Railtrack and Equitable Life. Bob Ayling - the man who fired Ms Page - was axed in her wake. He was then ditched as chief executive of BA. Lord Hollick was unable to dominate ITV. His plan to merge his United News &amp; Media group with Carlton were blocked and he was lambasted for selling the Daily Express to a porn baron. Tony Illsley of Telewest refused to take a second fiddle role in the merger with Flextech and jumped although his fall was cushioned with \u00a36m. Wim Duisenberg, the head of the European Central Bank, now dubbed Dim Wim. Under his stewardship the value of the euro has been in virtual free fall for most of the year. Ill-judged - if logical - remarks about intervention did nothing to turn the tide in the forex market. Elisabeth Murdoch conceded defeat in the succession battle at News Corp and quit the family firm. David Elstein, who brought us X-rated terrestrial telly as the chief executive of Channel 5, was replaced by Dawn Airey. Martha Lane Fox, the woman who epitomised the internet frenzy, went quiet. The flotation of her Lastminute.com group, founded with chum Brent Hoberman, marked the return to reality at the dot.com world of big plans and no profits. The shares hit 487p, but are now 78p. The BBC lost the rights to Match of the Day. Klaus Esser, the head of Mannesmann, lost Germany's biggest ever hostile bid battle. Vodafone's victory meant the dismemberment of the house that Klaus built as the UK group sold Mannesmann's traditional engineering operations as well as the Orange mobile phone operations. The biggest stockmarket faller this year is likely to be WILink, provider of online investment products and services. It was previously known as Knutsford, the company which was once tipped to take over Marks &amp; Spencer. It was backed by high profile property and retail businessmen Archie Norman, Nick Leslau, Nigel Wray and Julian Richer - known collectively as the \"awesome foursome\". Alchemy, the venture capital firm headed by Jon Moulton, seemed certain to buy Rover from BMW until the Germans abruptly ditched their deal. Instead they sold the struggling car maker for a nominal \u00a310 to the Phoenix consortium headed by former Rover chief executive John Towers.",

It had begun to tackle housing, education, and employment in a radical way. The regeneration was having some success.</p> <p>Now, though, the national image is of Peckham as a desolate estate and the focus has been on troublesome gangs. When Nissan used the slogan \"Built to tackle the most inhospitable places on earth. Including Peckham,\" to advertise its cars, it was bad enough. But now the area is the focus of the nation's sympathy as well as the butt of its jokes.</p> <p>As one 15-year-old boy explained: \"They portray Peckham to be a really, really bad place. I have lived in Peckham all my life and I don't think it's a bad place. Young boys don't die every day here and that's the image they try to portray. Gangs exist everywhere but they are making out these Peckham gangs are a brand new revelation.\"</p> <p>Damilola's death is hanging over Peckham. The aftermath is everywhere - in the books of remembrance in the library and in other public places, in the piles of faded flowers lying at the 10-year-old's school, and in the stairway where he collapsed after he had been stabbed.</p> <p>There are now more police on the High Street and in Rye Lane than ever before, and there are notices appealing for witnesses to the murder. On the piazza by the library where the CCTV camera caught Damilola's last moments as he went tripping and jumping along, an older girl is teasing a younger boy, warning him \"You know what happened to Damilola.\" People are fighting to beat exclusion and fragmentation here - factors so clearly manifest in a place where 25% of the people have an income of less than \u00a3100 a week and where 52% of those in employment earn less than \u00a3150.</p> <p>Uanu Seshmi runs the From Boyhood to Manhood project, taking in children excluded from school or on the verge of it, young offenders and \"good\" boys, too. He says: \"The majority of boys who come to us have anger management problems. They have frustration, loss of self esteem. They are alienated, they don't under stand where they belong in terms of society. Some of them are in gangs but lots of boys don't want to get involved and want a way out of gangs.</p> <p>\"The majority of young black boys will be very lucky to come from a background where their parents help to clarify issues about who they are as a black person. They are confused. They are in a real muddle in terms of their father, who is either not there, or confused or contradictory. We clarify issues about their responsibilities as a man.\"</p> <p>Mr Seshmi is a volunteer and, because of lack of space and resources, his project can take only a small number of boys. He says he will have to give up if he does not get proper funding.</p> <p>Decima Francis, who runs SASS, a project for the youth of Peckham, springs to defend the area. She returned from the US to live here because she missed it, and also feels there is not enough going for the local community.</p> <p>She says: \"It's a new area now, more or less because we have got new buildings and we have got new people in the area. It's a community of transition. Our work is to help people settle in and get used to the area. But what isn't here is a theatre, a performing arts base. There isn't a civic centre, there's nowhere for people to congregate or get married or have church events.\"</p> <p>Her concerns are reflected in the niggles felt across the five housing estates that are part of the Peckham Partnership's \u00a3260m, seven-year single regeneration scheme, which is the biggest in the country and involves the largest shift and resettlement of people in Europe. Its aim is to \"make Peckham a place where people choose to live, work and visit\".</p> <p>Hordle Promenade, the flats where Damilola died and other blocks, such as St Briavel's Court where he lived, are being pulled down.</p> <p>But many people find their new, smarter accommodation is not without its problems: they say the walls are so thin they get no privacy, and the rooms are smaller, so much so that you can't always get the furniture through the doors. \"It's still on the cheap, unfortunately,\" said one local resident. Recently, a tenants' group passed a vote of no-confidence in the Peckham Partnership management.</p> <p>Mike Rahman, development manager for Peckham Partnership's tenants' and residents forum, said: \"People still haven't got jobs and health has not improved.\"</p> <p>However, the partnership has achieved some success. There's Peckham Arch and Peckham Pulse, and also the award-winning library designed by Alsop &amp; Stormer and the attempt to create a town square around it. Crime has been reduced; three years ago Southwark had the highest crime rate in London but now it is in joint ninth place. The partnership has spent \u00a32m on community safety, spending \u00a3300,000 on CCTV.</p> <p>Krystina Stimakovits, the coordinator of Peckham voluntary sector forum, has just submitted an application for lottery funding on behalf of 25 groups. \"It's been a very mixed picture in Peckham,\" she says. \"There have been a lot of successes, but there's a lot of frustration because a lot of things that could have happened, didn't. Halls are disappearing, and there had been a lot of support for a multi-purpose community centre - African communities have a lot of social events. But the church halls get booked up over weekends.\"</p> <p>Regeneration was meant to be holistic, but very little has been reflecting the community's needs, she says. There had been many lost opportunities. \"Space is always the key problem. There's a lot of positive energy about and will to do things, but I think it's a struggle to get resources. The people who are good at communicating with youngsters are not necessarily the ones who write good funding applications or reports. It all boils down to listening to what the community is saying.\"</p> <p>After the terrible events of a month ago, it is just possible that Southwark council, Peckham Partnership and others will now be listening more carefully to the community's voice. Somehow, if slowly, Peckham might just get to be \"a place where people choose to live, work and visit\".</p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/\" target=\"_new\">Policing crime</a><br> <b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,404947,00.html\">30 November: Straw appeals to public after 'evil' schoolboy murder</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404836,00.html\">30 November: 'My son is dead and I am bitter'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,404700,00.html\">30 November, leader: Death in Peckham</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404901,00.html\">30 November: Head defends bullying record</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,404903,00.html\">30 November: Estate is 'one of toughest in Europe'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404333,00.html\">29 November: Death of a schoolboy</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4097793,00.html\">29 November: It's lawless out there</a><br><br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Metropolitan police</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">The home office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/100/100821.pdf\" target=\"_new\">Ofsted report: the Oliver Goldsmith primary school</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.southlondononline.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Local media: South London online</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.southwark.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">London borough of Southwark</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.thereal.com/o-041798.html\" target=\"_new\">Photographs of the North Peckham estate</a></p>",

Where there is a political will there is usually a way, and the G7, International Monetary Fund and World Bank worked hard to avoid the embarrassment of missing their target.</p> <p>By Friday, when the World Bank held its last board meeting of the year, 22 countries had had their poverty reduction plans approved, qualifying them for interim debt relief of $35bn (\u00a323bn).</p> <p>They are: Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Guyana, Honduras; Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Sao Tome and Principe, Malawi, Nicaragua, Niger, and Rwanda.</p> <p>Three more - Chad, Ivory Coast and Ethiopia - are likely to be welcomed in early next year, according to staff at the World Bank and IMF.</p> <p>The HIPC initiative, established in 1996 by the World Bank and IMF, originally identified 41 countries for debt relief but it proceeded painfully slowly, offering help to just seven in three years.</p> <p>By late 1998 there was a consensus that the programme needed to be speeded up and made more generous, leading to the launch in 1999 of an enhanced initiative aimed at cut debt servicing by $100bn. Since then the pace has quickened dramatically.</p> <p>Jeffrey Katz, the World Bank's senior economist for the scheme, said part of the reason for the delay was that countries were required to build up a three-year record of good behaviour before they were offered debt relief.</p> <p>But the public commitment by G7 to push 20 countries through by the end of this year was important. \"They didn't make the commitment out of thin air. A high-level public commitment was very helpful to us,\" he said, denying accusations of bureaucratic delay.</p> <p>Of the remaining 19 countries originally identified for relief, four - Angola, Kenya, Vietnam and Yemen - no longer need help, two - Ghana and Laos - have decided not to seek help, Togo is disqualified because it does not have a World Bank/IMF programme, and the rest are involved in armed conflict.</p> <p>A senior IMF official said there was a twofold challenge facing countries receiving debt relief under the programme.</p> <p>First, they had to develop comprehensive poverty reduction strategies. Second, they had to ensure that they used the extra resources wisely.</p> <p>Countries locked in conflict must find peace but even if they do, debt relief is unlikely to be the first priority.</p> <p>The IMF official said the emphasis would be on offering them help in establishing basic governance and ensuring that they had the institutional capacity to handle debt relief when it was delivered.</p> <p>The IMF and World Bank are producing a joint paper for their Spring meetings on dealing with such countries.</p> <p>Clare Short, the British international development secretary, is keen to get across the message that debt relief is not the only answer to poverty reduction. Her globalisation white paper, published earlier this month, pointed out that other forms of assistance, including more generous aid budgets, were necessary.</p> <p>\"Moreover, huge numbers of people live in countries which are not highly indebted, particularly south Asia,\" the white paper said. \"It is vital that their needs are not neglected as a result of our efforts to help the HIPC countries.\"</p> <p>In February the government will host a conference at Lancaster House in London which will bring the IMF, World Bank, Unicef, the UN Development Programme, governments from the developed and developing world, the business community and civil society together to discuss how to step up efforts to meet international targets for poverty reduction by 2015.</p>",

Since then the pace has quickened dramatically. Jeffrey Katz, the World Bank's senior economist for the scheme, said part of the reason for the delay was that countries were required to build up a three-year record of good behaviour before they were offered debt relief. But the public commitment by G7 to push 20 countries through by the end of this year was important. \"They didn't make the commitment out of thin air. A high-level public commitment was very helpful to us,\" he said, denying accusations of bureaucratic delay. Of the remaining 19 countries originally identified for relief, four - Angola, Kenya, Vietnam and Yemen - no longer need help, two - Ghana and Laos - have decided not to seek help, Togo is disqualified because it does not have a World Bank/IMF programme, and the rest are involved in armed conflict. A senior IMF official said there was a twofold challenge facing countries receiving debt relief under the programme. First, they had to develop comprehensive poverty reduction strategies. Second, they had to ensure that they used the extra resources wisely. Countries locked in conflict must find peace but even if they do, debt relief is unlikely to be the first priority. The IMF official said the emphasis would be on offering them help in establishing basic governance and ensuring that they had the institutional capacity to handle debt relief when it was delivered. The IMF and World Bank are producing a joint paper for their Spring meetings on dealing with such countries. Clare Short, the British international development secretary, is keen to get across the message that debt relief is not the only answer to poverty reduction. Her globalisation white paper, published earlier this month, pointed out that other forms of assistance, including more generous aid budgets, were necessary. \"Moreover, huge numbers of people live in countries which are not highly indebted, particularly south Asia,\" the white paper said. \"It is vital that their needs are not neglected as a result of our efforts to help the HIPC countries.\" In February the government will host a conference at Lancaster House in London which will bring the IMF, World Bank, Unicef, the UN Development Programme, governments from the developed and developing world, the business community and civil society together to discuss how to step up efforts to meet international targets for poverty reduction by 2015.",

David Hinchliffe, Labour chairman of the Commons health select committee, said ministers risked a revolt if they did not think again about proposals to abolish community health councils. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, wants to set up a new Patient Advocacy and Liaison Service to handle complaints against hospitals and GP practices. When he announced the plan in July it was criticised by the British Medical Association, law society and consumer groups on the grounds that the advocates would be employed by NHS trusts and might be reluctant to expose their mistakes. He tried to answer the point in the health bill, published earlier this month, by giving the advocacy service statutory recognition and stronger financial muscle.

This idea held sway for some time, until it was eventually realised that the myriad bodies orbiting between Mars and Jupiter (in what is now called the main belt) are simply primordial debris that never managed to accumulate into the planet predicted by Bode's Law.

Fundamentally this was not a new idea, because comets had been known to have planet-crossing orbits for some time. Even as far back as 1694, Edmond Halley (for whom the famous comet is named) had suggested that impact-induced calamities and upheavals must have occurred in the past. But there are few comets, whereas 19th-century astronomers were finding a host of asteroids. Comets are easy to find because they are bright, being surrounded by vast clouds of water vapour.

The rocky asteroid that entered the atmosphere above Siberia in 1908 was only about 60 yards across. When it exploded at a height of around five miles it released energy equivalent to about 15 megatons of TNT, burning and flattening the largely uninhabited forest over an area of almost 1,000 square miles.

      "body": "<p><strong>E-commerce</strong><br></p> <p>At the end of 1999, predicting the year ahead for companies involved in e-commerce was easy: explosion followed by implosion. It happened exactly as expected - a surge of new internet start-ups was followed first by a puncturing of some of the ludicrously high valuations put on the bubble.com companies then by the actual failure of some of the first-wave companies like Boo.com, Boxman and Clickmango. Meanwhile in the business-to-business (B2B) sector, accounting for 80% of all e-business, things purred along nicely, apparently immune from the forces that made it difficult if not impossible for any business-to-consumer start-up to make a profit.</p> <p> Next year will be more difficult to call because it will be a mixture of several forces all happening simultaneously. First, web start-ups will continue to go bust or be rescued by Old Economy players plugging the gaps in their own web strategies. Remember, 50% of all (conventional) small companies fail after their first four years. The casualty rate among dot.coms - often run by inexperienced managers - is bound to be as least as great.</p> <p> Second, there will be consolidation as stronger companies (like the providers of free internet access) gobble up their competitors in order to secure a big enough market share to be able to charge for what they are providing. There's still no such thing as a free lunch.</p> <p> Third, we may see the beginning of a fresh wave of start ups - armed with second-mover advantage - who, having learned from the mistakes of first movers, will try to build companies biologically linked to the web rather than glued on to it. It is very difficult to predict what they will be like - but some, like games companies, will use the new location-based wireless technologies so community games can be played.</p> <p> Meanwhile, the problems of the B2C sector will move to the B2B area where there is bound to be a shake-out among the burgeoning electronic market places each trying to undercut the other in the internet world where the consumer id king. There simply isn't room for all of them and rationalisation is bound to take place. Nor will mainstream B2B companies selling to other businesses be immune from the shakeout in all the other sectors. Nor will they be immune from the slowing down of the US economy, the source of so much world economic growth. And if the US slowdown turns into a serious recession then there will only be one bit of sensible advice. Run for cover.</p> <p><strong>Victor Keegan</strong><br></p> <p> <strong>Computers</strong><br></p> <p>It would be hard to claim nothing happened in a market where thousands of new PCs were introduced, but most new models were indistinguishable from the ones they replaced. There was progress. Over the year, a typical \u00a3699 multimedia PC - actually \u00a3875 including VAT - went from a 500MHz Intel Celeron to an 800MHz Pentium III. The standard hard drive also grew from 13GB to 20GB.</p> <p> There were some new options from the PC industry's building block suppliers, too. Microsoft published a new version of Windows, while Intel launched a new processor family. However, anyone running Windows Me (Millennium Edition) on a Pentium 4 would be hard pushed to spot the differences, except for processor speeds reaching 1.5GHz.</p> <p> In other respects, the Wintel duo had a tough year. Intel sometimes struggled to meet demand for chips, leaving its rival AMD to grab market share with cheaper, faster Athlon and Duron processors. Intel also admitted it might have made a mistake by insisting on high-priced Rambus memory chips for the Pentium 4, and it is now developing support for standard chips. Meanwhile, the long-promised 64-bit version of the Pentium, the Itanium, seemed to disappear into thin air.</p> <p> Microsoft suffered worse indignities as it was dragged through the mire by the US Justice Department, and its share price halved. Ironically, the fall in Microsoft's stock, which followed the guilty verdict, initiated a downturn in the whole tech market, wiping hundreds of billions of dollars off the value of IT shares, stock options and pension funds.</p> <p> Threatened with break up - the DoJ wants to replace one powerful monopoly with two powerful monopolies - Microsoft responded with .Net (dot net), a new strategy that involves redesigning all its products to integrate seamlessly over the internet.</p> <p> But Wintel's rivals failed to benefit, in spite of massive journalistic hype. The Linux version of Unix continued to do spectacularly well in the market for small, single-processor web servers but failed to make ground either against Windows on the desktop or Sun's Unix servers in the serious hosting business.</p> <p> Apple suffered from the failure of IBM's PowerPC processor to keep up with Intel and AMD in the megahertz race, and from the market failure of its new fan-free G4 Cube computer, launched in July. It also failed to ship Mac OS X, the long-awaited Unix-based replacement for its aged desktop operating system, and the beta test version met with a somewhat mixed response.</p> <p> But Apple was not the only company suffering end-of-year blues. Profit warnings from Gateway, Compaq and other PC manufacturers suggest that, at best, the PC market has failed to grow as much as expected, and may have suffered a reverse. Since most leading PC suppliers were planning to grow faster than the market, the result could be a bloodbath in a channel stuffed with unwanted products.</p> <p> The superfast \u00a3999 PC that would have seemed astonishingly cheap a year ago may well cost a good deal less in another couple of months.</p> <p><strong>Jack Schofield</strong><br></p> <p> <strong>Handhelds</strong><br></p> <p>The palmtop computer market had a great year, with Palm machines invading the mainstream market. But while Palm's audience was becoming less geeky, some of the geeks were moving on to better things. </p> <p>The rival with most appeal was the expandable Handspring Visor range, developed by the team behind the original Palm Pilot, rather than the disappointing Clie, which Sony launched in the US.

Both would greatly change the way we use the net, making the online experience more enjoyable and offering a boost to e-commerce. Today most users are still waiting, and many who have tried to get either have had their fingers badly burnt.</p> <p>At the centre of the debacle is Britain's telephone monopoly, British Telecom. Perhaps we shouldn't have believed this year would bring much change, after the company's chairman Sir Iain Vallance likened net users to \"over-exuberant children\". Indeed, that was a theme they persisted with for most of the year, stalling over giving users ADSL and giving rivals access to 'their' exchanges, in order that they might provide what Britain's net community was crying out for.</p> <p>Although, through the summer months, it was possible to have sympathy with Vallance's view. The thought of giving access to the nation's telephone network to eager hopefuls like Breathe.net (the 'lifestyle ISP' which got rid of 500 'heavy' users in July, and called in the receivers in December) and AltaVista (which, in June, said it had 100,000 users, but admitted in August it actually had none) appeared to be the height of folly.</p> <p> But BT's consistent bungling through the year ensures they get most of the blame. Many of those users who have managed to prize ADSL from BT have been badly let down - their connections have failed to work, and support has been non-existant. Oftel, the telecoms regulator often accused of being in BT's pocket, has also finally launched an investigation into alleged anti-competitive moves by BT.</p> <p>Will 2001 bring any change? The \"local loop\" is finally unbundled next summer, which means BT's rivals will have to be allowed access to exchanges. That should mean more choice for consumers, and lower costs. </p> <p>But, after a year when Britain's internet access has been as unreliable as its trains, announcements of new services - from BT and its rivals - should be taken only with a hefty pinch of salt.</p> <p><strong>Neil Mcintosh</strong><br></p> <p> <strong>Mobile phones</strong><br></p> <p>The big disappointment of 2000 was the explosion that didn't happen.

It means we may be surprised if things are better than our low expectations rather than being disappointed because they didn't reach our high expectations.</p> <p>Although the timetable for high speed, broadband phones with powerful internet capabilities has been pushed into the future interactive, let there be no doubt that the longer-term future for mobiles is still awesome.

      "bodyText": "E-commerce At the end of 1999, predicting the year ahead for companies involved in e-commerce was easy: explosion followed by implosion. It happened exactly as expected - a surge of new internet start-ups was followed first by a puncturing of some of the ludicrously high valuations put on the bubble.com companies then by the actual failure of some of the first-wave companies like Boo.com, Boxman and Clickmango. Meanwhile in the business-to-business (B2B) sector, accounting for 80% of all e-business, things purred along nicely, apparently immune from the forces that made it difficult if not impossible for any business-to-consumer start-up to make a profit. Next year will be more difficult to call because it will be a mixture of several forces all happening simultaneously. First, web start-ups will continue to go bust or be rescued by Old Economy players plugging the gaps in their own web strategies. Remember, 50% of all (conventional) small companies fail after their first four years. The casualty rate among dot.coms - often run by inexperienced managers - is bound to be as least as great. Second, there will be consolidation as stronger companies (like the providers of free internet access) gobble up their competitors in order to secure a big enough market share to be able to charge for what they are providing. There's still no such thing as a free lunch. Third, we may see the beginning of a fresh wave of start ups - armed with second-mover advantage - who, having learned from the mistakes of first movers, will try to build companies biologically linked to the web rather than glued on to it. It is very difficult to predict what they will be like - but some, like games companies, will use the new location-based wireless technologies so community games can be played. Meanwhile, the problems of the B2C sector will move to the B2B area where there is bound to be a shake-out among the burgeoning electronic market places each trying to undercut the other in the internet world where the consumer id king. There simply isn't room for all of them and rationalisation is bound to take place. Nor will mainstream B2B companies selling to other businesses be immune from the shakeout in all the other sectors. Nor will they be immune from the slowing down of the US economy, the source of so much world economic growth. And if the US slowdown turns into a serious recession then there will only be one bit of sensible advice. Run for cover. Victor Keegan Computers It would be hard to claim nothing happened in a market where thousands of new PCs were introduced, but most new models were indistinguishable from the ones they replaced. There was progress. Over the year, a typical \u00a3699 multimedia PC - actually \u00a3875 including VAT - went from a 500MHz Intel Celeron to an 800MHz Pentium III. The standard hard drive also grew from 13GB to 20GB. There were some new options from the PC industry's building block suppliers, too. Microsoft published a new version of Windows, while Intel launched a new processor family. However, anyone running Windows Me (Millennium Edition) on a Pentium 4 would be hard pushed to spot the differences, except for processor speeds reaching 1.5GHz. In other respects, the Wintel duo had a tough year. Intel sometimes struggled to meet demand for chips, leaving its rival AMD to grab market share with cheaper, faster Athlon and Duron processors. Intel also admitted it might have made a mistake by insisting on high-priced Rambus memory chips for the Pentium 4, and it is now developing support for standard chips. Meanwhile, the long-promised 64-bit version of the Pentium, the Itanium, seemed to disappear into thin air. Microsoft suffered worse indignities as it was dragged through the mire by the US Justice Department, and its share price halved. Ironically, the fall in Microsoft's stock, which followed the guilty verdict, initiated a downturn in the whole tech market, wiping hundreds of billions of dollars off the value of IT shares, stock options and pension funds. Threatened with break up - the DoJ wants to replace one powerful monopoly with two powerful monopolies - Microsoft responded with .Net (dot net), a new strategy that involves redesigning all its products to integrate seamlessly over the internet. But Wintel's rivals failed to benefit, in spite of massive journalistic hype. The Linux version of Unix continued to do spectacularly well in the market for small, single-processor web servers but failed to make ground either against Windows on the desktop or Sun's Unix servers in the serious hosting business. Apple suffered from the failure of IBM's PowerPC processor to keep up with Intel and AMD in the megahertz race, and from the market failure of its new fan-free G4 Cube computer, launched in July. It also failed to ship Mac OS X, the long-awaited Unix-based replacement for its aged desktop operating system, and the beta test version met with a somewhat mixed response. But Apple was not the only company suffering end-of-year blues. Profit warnings from Gateway, Compaq and other PC manufacturers suggest that, at best, the PC market has failed to grow as much as expected, and may have suffered a reverse. Since most leading PC suppliers were planning to grow faster than the market, the result could be a bloodbath in a channel stuffed with unwanted products. The superfast \u00a3999 PC that would have seemed astonishingly cheap a year ago may well cost a good deal less in another couple of months. Jack Schofield Handhelds The palmtop computer market had a great year, with Palm machines invading the mainstream market. But while Palm's audience was becoming less geeky, some of the geeks were moving on to better things. The rival with most appeal was the expandable Handspring Visor range, developed by the team behind the original Palm Pilot, rather than the disappointing Clie, which Sony launched in the US. The consolation was that both Handspring and Sony adopted the Palm OS operating system under licence, allaying fears that Palm would eventually be isolated and defeated, like Apple. Nonetheless, the summer also saw Microsoft's hardware partners making rapid increases in sales of handhelds, albeit from a very small base. After a miserable start in 1998, Windows CE for palmtops was reborn as the Pocket PC, with colourful products such as the Compaq iPaq, Hewlett-Packard Jornada 545 and Casio E-125 and EM-500 making the Palm IIIc look both underpowered and overpriced. In the UK at least, Psion continued to lead the way in developing handhelds with keyboards. The popular Revo, which looks like a spectacle case, was upgraded to the Revo Plus, and larger Series 7 machines were sold as notebook PC substitutes. However, the Psion Series 5 lost its distinction of having the best keyboard ever built into a pocketable computer: in September, Hewlett-Packard launched the CE-based Jornada 720 Handheld PC, which not only has a better keyboard, but a colour screen too. The year also saw the first glimmers of what could be a new boom as handheld computer technology converges with the high end of the mobile phone business. A Pocket PC or Handspring Visor can be converted into a usable mobile by plugging in a GSM expansion module, and in France, Sagem launched the WA3050: essentially a Pocket PC combined with a dual band GSM/GPRS phone. Microsoft also showed off a slim prototype codenamed Stinger, styled more like a conventional mobile phone. This is intended to compete against mobiles such as the Ericsson R380 smartphone based on Symbian's Epoc - the operating system originally developed by Psion for its handheld machines. Over the year, what was seen as a simple electronic Filofax somehow turned into a combination electronic book reader, MP3 player, games console, camera and GSM phone, to the point where someone loaded the whole Top Gun movie on to IBM's new 1 gigabyte plug-in hard drive (in handy CompactFlash format) and played it on a Pocket PC. Geek heaven? Maybe. But most mainstream buyers would probably settle for a slim monochrome Palm if it cost \u00a399.99 or less - preferably \u00a349.99 including VAT. The barrier to the widespread adoption of handhelds may now have less to do with specification than price. Jack Schofield Getting online In a year when the rush online has barely abated (around 10 million people in the UK logged on for the first time in 2000), it is ironic that the last 12 months have been marked by the greatest dissatisfaction and confusion about the ways to get online since the net was popularised in the mid 90s.

      "bodyText": "A British man has been named by an Islamic newspaper as the suicide bomber responsible for killing nine other people in a bomb attack in Kashmir on Christmas Day. Zarb-i-Momin, the weekly mouthpiece for the militant Islamic group Jaish Mohammed, claimed in a special edition that Birmingham-born Mohammed Bilal, 24, achieved \"martyrdom\" this week by loading a stolen car with explosives and detonating himself outside an Indian army barracks in Srinagar. The blast killed six Indian soldiers and three Kashmiris, in Pakistan's struggle to free Kashmir from Indian rule. Mohammed Bilal, a former student from the West Midlands, is thought to have left Britain to join the separatist movement in Pakistan six years ago, where he received military training from the militant faction, Harkat-ul Ansar. While the Foreign Office said it was investigating the claims alongside the Indian authorities, Islamic leaders in Britain were swift to reject them. Sheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed, leader of the radical al-Muhajiroun group based in north London, said last night: \"It is quite possible that a British Muslim was involved in the car bomb, but Mohammed Bilal is not the correct name.\" He added: \"Bilal refers to whole divisions of fighters, it is a name dating back to ancient times. It does not refer to one man.\" Omar Mohammed confirmed that his organisation sends out \"freedom fighters\" from Britain to Kashmir on a regular basis, and that the last batch, a group of 23- and 24-year-olds, left some two weeks before Christmas. It was \"quite possible\", he said, that one among their number had been involved in the attack. He said that 2,000 British Muslims go abroad each year to join armed Islamic organisations and that 20% of them head for Kashmir to engage in the war against Indian rule.",

      "bodyText": "The mobile phone industry has acquired a formidable new adversary: the lawyer who did much to win billions of dollars in damages from the tobacco and asbestos companies. Peter Angelos, who owns the Baltimore Orioles baseball club, has agreed to represent a doctor who is claiming $800m because, he says, heavy use of mobile phones contributed to his brain tumour. Christopher Newman, 41, also from Baltimore, is suing Motorola, Verizon, SBC Communications, the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association and the Telecommunications Industry Association. \"The phone companies knew and they turned their heads,\" he said. \"They made a choice for me. I would like to see the industry acknowledging the risk and fund research to help solve the problem.\" Mr Angelos said six months ago that he was studying mobile phone litigation but that he would not pursue the matter unless he was 90% confident of victory. Now he is said to be on the point of bringing cases in California, Kentucky and Maryland. But Dr Newman's case cannot have been helped by two studies produced last week, both of which showed that mobile phone users were no more or less likely than anyone else to get brain tumours or cancers. Surveys suggest that mobile phones are used by two in three Britons and one in three Americans. About 16,500 people in the United States develop brain cancer each year. Kenneth Rothman, a professor of epidemiology at Boston University school of public health, said of the two new studies: \"They are the best information to date and they provide much reassurance.\" One was funded by the mobile phone industry, however, though it was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The other was supported by the National Cancer Institute. Both found that, whatever the criteria used to test the data, there was no suggestion of a link between brain cancer and cell phones \"Based on the published evidence to date, I don't think there's any evidence that cell phones cause cancer,\" said Dr Peter Inskip, one of the leaders of the cancer institute study.",

      "bodyText": "The government stands to lose billions of pounds as a result of negotiating soft contracts with the private sector to build Britain's schools, hospitals and transport infrastructure. Inquiries by the national audit office and the public accounts committee have revealed that the Treasury has failed to negotiate clawback clauses in which the taxpayer could share the extra profit if the private sector refinances loan deals. In some cases, refinancing deals mean private sector firms, such as Group Four, are projecting to double their planned rate of return and move into profit within three years of a 25-year contract. The oversight has led one Labour MP, Alan Williams, to describe the right to tender for private finance initiative (PFI) deals as the equivalent of Christmas. The Treasury has now admitted to the national audit office and the public accounts committee that it had failed to negotiate clawback clauses in most of the current \u00a317bn worth of PFI deals. Clawback clauses have not been negotiated in 69% of PFI deals, measured by their monetary value. The Treasury financial secretary, Stephen Timms, has ruled that all future PFI deals must include a clause ensuring the private and public sector share equally in any windfall profit due to refinancing deals. He has also negotiated a clawback deal for the \u00a3100m refurbishment of the Treasury. Private sector firms find it easy to refinance loans at cheaper interest rates and longer repayment times once the initial construction is completed to budget and the project is shown to be running smoothly. At that point the risk of the project falls sharply, making the markets more willing to lend at cheaper rates. There is also evidence that the markets are becoming more confident about the political stability of PFI deals, so making more lenders willing to offer refinancing deals. The national audit office has already highlighted the massively higher than expected profits which will be reaped by Group 4 and Carrilion for the first prison built and run by the private sector at Fazakerley, Liverpool. The companies have refinanced the deal after two years, lifting their expected returns over 25 years from \u00a317.5m to \u00a331.6m - an 81% increase. Only \u00a31m of the extra profit is to be paid back to the prison service. As a result, the projected rate of return for the initial shareholders on a publicly funded project has tripled from 12.8 % to 39%. The contractors have admitted they will be getting a 100% pay-off in two and a half years. The public accounts committee has been told that of 105 signed PFI contracts, only 29% of them measured by value are covered by clawback arrangements. Not one of the 15 Home Office PFI contracts has clawback clauses. Mr Williams, a senior member of the public accounts committee, said he did not object to companies making profits from PFI deals but he did object to taxpayers not getting their fair share of any unforseen windfall profits. The Treasury says all new PFI contracts will insist on 50% clawback of excess profits. It also claims government departments may have powers to withhold consent from refinancing, even if no clawback clause exists, if it can be shown the refinancing will alter the costs to the Treasury of early termination of the contract.",
