      "body": "<p><strong>Name:</strong> Milly Newman <br><strong>Age:</strong> 18 <br><strong>Place of residence:</strong> Devon <br><strong>Occupation:</strong> gap-year student going to study law at Cardiff University</p> <p> I remember reading through the details of the Netjetters competition when my mum handed me the advert and getting quite excited. I was already planning to travel for six months or so before going to uni, so this prize would be brilliant. The next morning, I went on the Guardian website and rambled 500 words about myself. I never expectted to hear about it again - after all, no one really wins these competitions. </p> <p>When, a good month later, I got a letter from the Guardian saying they'd been attempting to contact me and I was on a shortlist, I couldn't believe it. That alone would have been something to tell the grandchildren about (not that I've got any). </p> <p>Anyway, I phoned and arranged to meet the next morning at the Guardian offices in London for a chat. I tried asking how short the list was but no one would tell me. It wasn't until later I found out over 1,000 people had entered. They promised to let me know soon, but I didn't expect my mum to phone me at work the same night to tell me I'd won! I think my main feeling was shock, and that I'd wake up the next day to find out it was either a joke or they'd made a mistake or something like that. </p> <p>Since then, I've been trying to take the whole thing in. At the moment, as well as the excitement of leaving England and its miserable weather, I am very nervous at the thought of travelling alone. If you ask anyone, they would agree that I have little common sense or sense of direction so I can't help feeling that I'll end up alone in a completely strange country with no one to turn to for help. Or at least for the three months before my friends who are leaving later catch me up. </p> <p>I was already firmly set on the route I wanted to take before I entered, and that has been no problem. I exchanged a few e-mails with debs.w from Bridge the World, then went to see her at their big outlet in Camden Town. She couldn't have been more helpful with ideas to get the best from my trip, such as a stop at Ayres Rock and travelling overland from Singapore to Bangkok. For anyone who is travelling, I would definitely say go to the travel agents in person, sit with them for an hour or so and then you can find exactly the right route for you. For a big trip, it's more reassuring than doing everything by computer. </p> <p>Apart from organising my route, I feel scarily unpre pared. I have a new passport - if you're going to Oz, it needs to be valid for six months after you get back - and had injections (ask your doctor for details a good month before you leave), but that's about it. My main aim has really been to raise the money I need, so I've been working full-time - a big hello to everybody at Holes Bay in Poole - and hoping everything else falls into place. </p> <p>One thing I've found about travelling is that everyone knows somebody somewhere I'm going, and has useful advice for me, which is great. Also, other travellers are very sociable. On the train back from London, I met two guys - one from New Zealand and one from England - who had done a lot of travelling and we easily filled a two-hour journey talking about their/my travels. I picked up lots of useful things from their experiences and also got some hope that I won't end up completely alone! </p> <p>So, if anyone else has any advice, particularly about Vancouver, my first stop, please pass it on. How cold is it in Canada? Where are the best bars/caf\u00e9s/hostels/things to do? I promise to try out all the best suggestions so I can pass on my opinion of them! </p> <p>Until next time . . . </p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sam Rowbury <br><strong>Age:</strong> 29 <br><strong>Place of residence:</strong> London <br><strong>Occupation:</strong> civil servant<br></p> <p>My entry was written on a dark, Sunday evening in London. The rain was spattering the window and I was desperately trying to push away the thought of work the next morning. So, I wrote about how frustrated I was with my job and how wonderful it would be to see lions and elephants in Africa. This was very therapeutic but I never for a moment dreamt I would win or what that would actually mean. Fate decided to call my bluff. </p> <p>Most people spend months planning a trip like this. I've just had a few short weeks. Deciding on a route was the first thing. When you're presented with the whole world, it's a little overwhelming - particularly if you have never even been outside Europe. I started off by trying to do everything, but I soon realised it would be better to focus on a few countries. So I listed my priorities: I wanted to visit friends in San Francisco, see Southern Africa, go whale-watching in New Zealand, go skiing (anywhere) and spend lots of time relaxing. </p> <p>Eventually, I fixed on a route that would allow me to do all this. So it's New York and overland by train to San Francisco; then Fiji for New Year; travel down through New Zealand for a month; Sydney for three weeks with a stop-over in Alice Springs, before flying to Johannesburg. I'll spend about three months in Africa and I'll figure out my exact route later but I want to take in Zanzibar, Namibia, Tanzania, Cape Town and, if I can, Madagascar. There's a solar eclipse that will pass through the region next June so, if I still have any cash left, I'll stay on for that. It took me ages to come up with this itinerary and I'm sure it will all change once I'm out there but, for the moment, it sounds pretty exciting to me. </p> <p>I have had to learn about all the different types of immunisations you need. In the past I have had bad reactions to vaccinations so I am spreading the injections out over a few weeks to lessen the effect. My friends have taken great delight in listing all the horrible insects that will be waiting to infest me. These include a horrific creature found in freshwater lakes in Africa. Apparently, it swims up your urine and then attaches itself inside you with a sort of barbed grappling hook. My friends insist I must pee in staccato bursts to reduce the risk. </p> <p>On the practical side, I've fixed everything up at home. Work has been very good and given me six months unpaid leave. I've paid off my bills, cancelled all my standing orders and redirected my post. I've found someone to rent my room (my wise and generous landlady even said I could have it back again when I return). </p> <p>But the hardest thing has been the thought of leaving my girlfriend. I will miss her terribly and, although she is going to try and come out to meet me at some point, it will be months before I see her again. As my departure date has got closer, we have found ourselves spending as much time together as possible - squeezing out every last minute. Small things take on an unusual significance - our last trip to the cinema, our last Sunday morning. But she knows I love her very much and will always be there for her, no matter where I am. </p> <p>So, after all the planning, I'm nearly there. The tickets are booked. I've bought my rucksack and sleeping bag. I've had the jabs. I've got my passport and visas. The world's waiting for me. I wonder what it will be like. </p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sue Stubbings <br><strong>Age:</strong> 51 <br><strong>Place of residence:</strong> Cambridge <br><strong>Occupation:</strong> works for the county council's education department<br></p> <p> I started my entry for the Netjetters competition with the sentence \"I am 50, fairly fit and fed up\". None of it is true any more: yet another birthday has crept up on me; I have started a fitness regime (a grand name for running up and down the stairs every day) and I am certainly no longer fed up. I consider myself to be the luckiest and most excited person I know. </p> <p>I have never won anything before, probably because I've never entered anything. I cut the Netjetters advert out for my son, who is \"resting\" after finishing his degree. Having been desperate to travel for many years, on a whim I decided to enter myself. The words came easily as I imagined travelling for six months and all the places I wanted to go. I then forgot about it. </p> <p>My colleagues at work still laugh about my reaction when the Guardian contacted me. Apparently, I had my mouth hanging open, couldn't utter a word and then started shaking. Since that day my whole world has been turned upside down and it has been a frenzy of activity. There was a trip to the Guardian two days later for an interview where it was confirmed I was chosen. My three children happened to be going to London that weekend and we had a wonderful, very alcoholic time. They are as excited as I am. </p> <p>There were many immediate issues to be tackled: </p> <p>Work - in the jargon of my job in Education Welfare, would I be given \"authorised absence\" or would I be \"taken off roll\"? After an anxious week, I was given six months unpaid leave for which I am extremely grateful. </p> <p>Money - this proved to be worryingly easy as the bank was very accommodating. The fact that I could be 76 when I finish paying off the loan didn't seem to worry them. </p> <p>House - my son is currently in residence so it was decided to get in a couple of lodgers to help pay the bills. This means clearing my and my daughter's bedrooms, a mammoth task as tidiness is not a family trait. I do not know if anyone will fancy her orange and turquoise walls. </p> <p>The most pleasurable decision to be made was my route. Having the whole world to choose from was a bit daunting. The major choice was Africa or South America, as there were not enough air-miles for both. South America won. The final route is India, overland to Nepal, back to India, on to Singapore and around Malaysia, to Bali, Australia and New Zealand. Tahiti was to have been next but was crossed off by the airline no longer flying there (bang goes my fantasy of garlands and a grass skirt). It's straight on to South America and back home with a stop off in Spain. Not bad! </p> <p>I have never travelled alone. It is very scary - but I have been getting loads of advice from experienced travellers. I decided to join an overland trip from Mumbai, where I first land, to Nepal. This will give me time to find my travelling legs and get used to it all. The tour leader does not know yet that he/she will have to help me find a Net caf\u00e9 every week. This tour ends on December 24, so it is going to be Christmas in Kathmandu. </p> <p>I have spent the last decade making a lot of changes in my life and getting to know more about myself. The past year or two I have been restless and frustrated by not having the time or money to travel. Turning 50 did not help. It all no longer matters. </p> <p>This trip and its timing feel so right. I would love to share my luck and this adventure and hope you will join me on the Net! </p> <p> The Netjetters' tickets have been organised by Bridge The World, specialists in around the world travel.

This means clearing my and my daughter's bedrooms, a mammoth task as tidiness is not a family trait. I do not know if anyone will fancy her orange and turquoise walls. The most pleasurable decision to be made was my route. Having the whole world to choose from was a bit daunting. The major choice was Africa or South America, as there were not enough air-miles for both. South America won. The final route is India, overland to Nepal, back to India, on to Singapore and around Malaysia, to Bali, Australia and New Zealand. Tahiti was to have been next but was crossed off by the airline no longer flying there (bang goes my fantasy of garlands and a grass skirt). It's straight on to South America and back home with a stop off in Spain. Not bad! I have never travelled alone. It is very scary - but I have been getting loads of advice from experienced travellers. I decided to join an overland trip from Mumbai, where I first land, to Nepal. This will give me time to find my travelling legs and get used to it all. The tour leader does not know yet that he/she will have to help me find a Net caf\u00e9 every week. This tour ends on December 24, so it is going to be Christmas in Kathmandu. I have spent the last decade making a lot of changes in my life and getting to know more about myself. The past year or two I have been restless and frustrated by not having the time or money to travel. Turning 50 did not help. It all no longer matters. This trip and its timing feel so right. I would love to share my luck and this adventure and hope you will join me on the Net! The Netjetters' tickets have been organised by Bridge The World, specialists in around the world travel.

      "body": "<p>Nothing had prepared me for the view from my hotel by the Dead Sea - the serene, glittering blue that stretched horizontally before me, or the immense canyon wall slowly emerging from the white heat haze beyond. Nothing can be as elemental as this landscape. </p> <p>This is the lowest place on earth, the Valley of Salt, where the Bible meets the Koran and the Dead Sea separates Israel from Jordan. And it is here, in the desert, just along from where John baptised Jesus, that the Sanctuary of London has opened its Zara Spa, in association with the Swiss hotel chain M\u00f6venpick. They have endless supplies of water, as well as copious amounts of salt and mud from the Dead Sea. </p> <p>It is so hot here that flagstone or fabric will burn naked skin; so hot that it seems when you walk into the cool of the spa reception this is the only possible place to be. You are surrounded by pools, themselves surrounded by canopied terraces. The thalassotherapy pool, like the main pool of the resort, is built so the rim overlaps the sea behind, creating the illusion that you could swim into infinity (or at least Israel). It is 3% saline and pumps water through various jets so it pummels each part of your body. </p> <p>The Kneipp foot massage and two Dead Sea pools inside are a quarter pumped from the sea and so have all its mineral and saline properties, softening and antiseptic. \"If you have any problem,\" a high-powered American woman from Cairo assured me, \"anything growing,\" she said mysteriously, looking at her feet, \"it's gone.\" Many people come here from Egypt, Israel and the Gulf for the low humidity and the rich concentration of oxygen in the air. </p> <p>Should you desire more heat, the \"thermarium\" contains a steam room and \"caldarium\" - an elegant green-tiled room with heated benches, each with less invasive heat than a sauna, and plenty of loungers to cool off on afterwards. </p> <p>Then come the treatments. Beginning with a salt rub, in which coarse Dead Sea salt is mixed with almond oil and scrubbed all over the body to rid you of dead skin and stimulate circulation. Each morning, in a diamond-shaped room, I was smeared in the famed mud - camphor and aloe added to its 22 minerals and lavender-scented for relaxation - and left there, wrapped in my slimey envelope, a mummy in her tomb. Then, after a shower, the aromatherapy massage: scents and rhythmic touch combine to induce a state of dreamy euphoria, after which you wander out to the corridor in a daze, joining the other white-robed zombies doing the same. By now, your skin is so soft, your body so supple it feels elastic. </p> <p>Of course, you can always stumble the few yards down to the sea and cake yourself with mud. People sit half-camouflaged like birds on the rocks, their limbs covered in black mud which the sun bakes to green, or bob in the sea. </p> <p>There are delicious buffet banquets to start and end the day, caf\u00e9s and bars, as well as restaurants offering the world's cuisines. After eating, you can smoke apple or strawberry-scented tobacco through elaborate hubbly-bubblies, the coals replaced with tongs throughout the night, as you relax to the strains of Lady in Red, Feelings or Imagine alternating with Jordanian traditional music, all delivered by the in-house crooner. Or you can watch a be-tasselled bellydancer, the more alluring for her intense shyness. </p> <p>Leaving the table, you can flop straight into the huge outside pool, float belly-up and stare at the stars all night. But as the shadows gather in the crevices of the great rock behind, giving slant to the mountain, a restless twitch drives you out of its confines and into the desert or towards Amman... </p> <p>Huge gorges and scorched gulleys run beside you or beneath, streaked pink and red, rising higher and higher until your ears pop and the landscape becomes lunar. </p> <p>Houses ranging from simple bunkers of rough breeze block or concrete squares to ultramodern apartment blocks match the wan colours of the land. The nearer you are to Amman, the more palatial the homes - stucco turquoise paintwork or extravaganzas in marble. Arm in arm, the late King Hussein and his son, the more liberal King Abdullah, grin from signposts. </p> <p>White taxis can take you on set routes back and forth from the city, whereas yellow taxis will take you where you please. The ancient King's Highway winds over desert and mountain, south from Amman into Arabia, with Petra along the way. Mount Nebo is 800m above sea level, the place where Moses was laid to rest. From its summit, the mountains you have just passed look like mere dimples. The roads are good and the tarmac stripes on towards Madaba, a modern town of 65% Christian population with its thriving Bedouin markets. </p> <p>Up here atop the rock, all that's visible are the giant electricity pylons and telegraph poles; in the distance a train with its long straight line of phosphate cargo. Mosques of very modern design stud all roads, next to their domes the green neon-ringed minarets stand new and high, like rockets. </p> <p>Suddenly the road winds downwards and, echoing the jagged cliff edge, is the jutting architecture of a very modern hotel nestling at the bottom of a huge chasm: the Ma'in hot springs. Jordan has many natural hot springs, but none have been exploited to such spectacular effect in such magnificent surroundings. The volcanic springs gush fast on to smooth rust-red rock before falling to shallow streams far below, which are so boiling hot you leap the stones yelping to reach a clearing that lets the spring power down over you. The French-owned hotel is spacious and elegant, Arab chic and state-of-the-art treatments, more medical than beautifying. </p> <p>On the way home, to break the monotony of the road, lone neon tubes in all colours hang in the dark, heralding stops for Bedouin coffee from glinting pewter pots. Sudden caves of light appear, big tents below which men in flowing robes are briefly displayed, wedged comfortably on sofas around a fire, drinking and chatting in the warm night, in the middle of nowhere. </p> <p>You cannot, of course, leave without visiting the stone of Petra, the great city where the smears, creases and holes in the walls of sandstone rock have been fashioned into a neoclassical living wonder. But nothing can prepare you for that - unless it's the feeling of complete surrender induced by the great desert and sea of Jordan itself. </p> <p><strong> Beginner's guide to treatments</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Sauna</strong> - the Swedes' favourite. You sit with others in a room filled with dry-heat to warm and detoxify your body. </p> <p><strong> Steam room</strong> - like a sauna but with \"wet\" heat, ie steam. The effects are the same, it's just a matter of preference. </p> <p><strong> Steam cabinet</strong> - the clich\u00e9 of the health spa. Your body is shut in asteamy cabin while your head pokes out of a hole at the top. Your pores are opened so your body can better absorb theraputic creams and oils. </p> <p><strong> La stone</strong> - hot volcanic stones are placed on various points of the body. A natural therapy for relaxing rebalancing and destressing. </p> <p><strong> Full body wax</strong> - all hair from the neck downwards is removed with the aid of hot wax which is ripped off when it hardens. Yes, it is as painful as it sounds. </p> <p><strong> Seaweed wrap</strong> - you are covered in seaweed then wrapped in a hot towel. This detoxifying therapy is also said to reduce cellulite and aid weight loss. </p> <p><strong> Collagen facial</strong> - the 21st-century version of the traditional facial. A mask soaked in collagen (the stuff used in face lifts) is applied to your face which is then cleansed and toned. Thus, your face can absorb collagen without having to go under the knife. </p> <p><strong> Reiki </strong> - a therapist holds parts of your body looking for problem areas and energy blockages. </p> <p><strong> Body exfoliation</strong> - an exfoliating cream containing tiny granules, is smothered over your body to remove dead skin cells and give you a more polished appearance. </p> <p><strong> Lymphatic drainage </strong> - your skin is brushed abrasively before being massaged with a special oil.

      "body": "<p><strong> This winter I am determined to try snowboarding in powder but is there any way to stop the snow finding its way into my gloves and jacket? </strong> There is a glove designed specifically to prevent that. It works by a three-part process; an inner glove, your jacket and an outer glove. </p> <p><strong> Sounds a bit complicated, how does it work? </strong> First you put on an insulated fingerless glove that has a solid plastic cuff stitched into it above the wrist. Next the jacket is worn over the inner glove with the cuff wrapping around it. Then you pull on the outer glove, and align its plastic quick-release strap with the cuff on the inner glove. The two form a seal that guarantees snow won't get in. </p> <p><strong> Does this mean you have to have a special jacket as well?</strong> No, but the jacket has to have an adjustable cuff to fit over the glove. </p> <p><strong> Is the glove warm and waterproof as well?</strong> Yes.

      "bodyText": "This winter I am determined to try snowboarding in powder but is there any way to stop the snow finding its way into my gloves and jacket? There is a glove designed specifically to prevent that. It works by a three-part process; an inner glove, your jacket and an outer glove. Sounds a bit complicated, how does it work? First you put on an insulated fingerless glove that has a solid plastic cuff stitched into it above the wrist. Next the jacket is worn over the inner glove with the cuff wrapping around it. Then you pull on the outer glove, and align its plastic quick-release strap with the cuff on the inner glove. The two form a seal that guarantees snow won't get in. Does this mean you have to have a special jacket as well? No, but the jacket has to have an adjustable cuff to fit over the glove. Is the glove warm and waterproof as well? Yes. The inner glove has a breathable liner and the outer has Kevlar on the palm, so it is protective as well as fully waterproof. How much does it cost? It's not cheap at \u00a369.95.

      "body": "<p>Scale a frozen waterfall this winter. Ski off the side of the mountain into thin air. Buzz over moguls like a pro on nippy snow blades. The mountains offer so many exciting things that it seems a waste to spend every single day skiing. You probably wouldn't make a whole holiday out of any of these activities, but taking half a day to try something different could end up being the highlight of your week. </p> <p><strong> Ice climbing</strong><br> </p> <p>A frozen waterfall is a formidable sight: a suspended curtain of frozen water hanging hundreds of feet down the mountainside. If you peer through the deep cracks in the ice, you can see the water still running. Scaling the huge, slippery vertical wall is a totally different way of experiencing the mountain. </p> <p>Fitted with unwieldy climbing boots, vicious-looking crampons, harness, crash helmet and ice axes, I drove with my guide, Jean-Phillipe, to a little valley free of pistes and crowds a few miles from Val d'Is\u00e8re. We struggled along it (or I did - JP skipped like a mountain goat) until we reached the shining wall of ice I was to climb. The water freezes in rough bumps, so that some parts of the \"ice fall\" give you a favourable lean into the mountain and you feel like you've got it under control; others curve out, forcing you to climb what looks like a gentle overhang but leaves you clinging on. </p> <p>With ice axes in each hand and crampons on each foot, I was fully spiked up. Once JP had attached me to a safety line and shown me how it is meant to be done, it was my turn. I managed to plant my first axe after several strikes - it wasn't simply a matter of popping it; I had to strike with all my force as high as I could reach, often twice, for the pick to sink in securely. The same went for the crampons. Particularly where the ice was hard, I had to really kick to get a foothold. This made the whole activity aerobic, so I was soon panting. Every movement took a massive effort even though with feet planted properly I could stand fairly easily. </p> <p>It was difficult because it was exhausting and because crampons and ice axes don't always stick in easily. But in other ways it wasn't too hard. It was obvious what you were meant to do and, unlike rock climbing, you could make a handhold where you wanted. I managed to fall off twice when my ice axes slipped out, and swung pathetically from my harness until I managed to get some purchase again. </p> <p>When I finally got to the top, I was as happy to stop as I was to have accomplished the climb. But after a few minutes' rest, I remembered the romantic notion that had made me want to climb a frozen waterfall. The valley was quiet, JP out of sight behind a bump in the ice, and all around were the Alps, the snow and the icy waterfall. </p> <p>Putting my weight and my trust in JP, I leaned against my safety rope and walked backwards down the waterfall in easy, bouncing strides. After the trauma of climbing up, it didn't even occur to me to be nervous about abseiling down. </p> <p><strong> Paragliding</strong><br> </p> <p>On a clear day, I had enviously watched the multi-coloured canopies of paragliders soar above the snowy peaks, twirling and rising and putting us skiers to shame. Such a beautiful-looking sport had to be tried. So, firmly strapped to my guide, Serge, his skis either side of mine and the silk canopy neatly laid out behind, I prepared to float into space. </p> <p>The slope we were on, at the top of the Col de la Loze in Courchevel, was gently skiable for about 50 yards, and then plummeted away into a death-defying couloir. I prayed we would take off before we ended up sliding down it. No fear of that - when Serge gave the word, we let ourselves start moving down the slope for about five feet before we met with resistance from the canopy, which had immediately filled with air and stood puffed up behind us in a billowing wall of silk. Slowly we skied on until suddenly we seemed to be airborne. Then we weren't, and then we'd made it and were floating gently away from the mountainside. </p> <p>I was expecting to be terrified, but the fear was all in the anticipation. Although we were miles above the valley floor - and rising - peering down between our skis at a huge quantity of nothing, I felt quite safe on my makeshift seat jammed in between Serge's legs. </p> <p>Serge used strings to control the angle of the canopy, and before we knew it we were circling higher than the surrounding mountains. The views, of course, were special, though once I started to relax my death grip on Serge's legs I became more aware of the biting cold. </p> <p>The other unexpected problem was air sickness. The gentle swaying motion, compounded with the odd bumpy bit when we hit a thermal, added up to a worrying bout of nausea. Concerned at the prospect of me throwing up over his equipment, Serge brought us down after just five minutes (the normal flight time being 10). As we descended, all worries about high-altitude vomiting faded at the prospect of trying to land in one piece. The cables of the chairlift looked threateningly in the way, and I had to close my eyes as we swooped just above them. </p> <p>We landed with an ungainly thump. I promptly fell over backwards and struggled to my feet with the grace of a pregnant duck. But despite the fear, the sickness and the cold, once safely down I couldn't wait to be swooping above the peaks again. </p> <p> <strong> Snowblading</strong> </p> <p> If you've ever cursed your skis as you lumbered up the road with them slung over your shoulder, poles in hand, or if you've ever fallen having crossed your skis and ended up stuck in a snowdrift in a tangle of metal and fibreglass, you'll appreciate snowblades. Scarcely longer than boots, and not requiring poles, these are the minimalist approach to skiing. </p> <p>I thought I'd give them a quick try on the nursery slopes initally before attempting anything I'd regret. I shuffled to the top of the slope, and tipped myself over the edge. And it was easy! I thundered down, doubtless looking totally unco-ordinated with my feet wide apart and my hands everywhere, but feeling as safe as if I was on my own feet. </p> <p>The whole experience is much more instinctive than proper skis; it is more reminiscent of skidding on patches of ice in the school playground. With less thinking required to control your skis (at about 70cm long, you'd have to try hard to cross them) the sense of balance comes more naturally. I found myself crouching to lower my centre of gravity, and automatically shifting weight from foot to foot. In less than an hour, I was tackling difficult runs with no problem. </p> <p>The shortness of snowblades makes them useless for off-piste, and not terribly fast, though you feel like you are moving like snow off a shovel. But they come into their own on moguls. They turn on a sixpence, they are easy to jump with, a piece of cake to control and if you do bury them in a deep bit of snow, you simply step out of it. Even an intermediate skier like myself can confidently go down icy, bumpy, slushy black runs, something I would be nervous to attempt on regular skis. </p> <p>It feels great having your hands free, although I was a bit at a loss as to what to do with them; I ended up waving at everybody and clicking my fingers in time to any tune going through my head as I grooved down the slope, jumping and turning and whizzing about. </p> <p>I loved snowblades so much, for the convenience and ease and fun of them, that I considered not bothering going back to normal skis again; my only qualm was that while skiing feels like a proper sport, snowblades feel like a toy. But after all, what are the slopes but an enormous playground? </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> All these activities are available in any major ski resort. Snow blades can be hired from any ski-hire shop for around FFr50 for half a day, and can be worn with ski boots. </p> <p>Anna Rockall paraglided from the Col de la Loze, Courchevel 1850, France, and booked it through Chardon Loisirs, 04 79 08 39 60.

The next thing you know, you've garnered worldwide critical praise as the long-suffering mobster's wife in hit TV show The Sopranos. Not that 36-year-old Edie Falco has let it go to her head, as her latest movie, Judy Berlin, proves. It took the director's prize for her long-time friend Eric Mendelsohn at Sundance last year, and sees Falco in the title role; a semi-anonymous jobbing actress from Long Island. And who said truth was stranger than fiction?</p> <p><strong>Did you recognise Judy's plight as a struggling actress?</strong></p> <p>Yes. God knows I was a struggling actress for a long time, but our approaches were very different. It seems clear that Judy has known that this is what she wants to do. I almost fell into this, rather than aiming towards it. I've been acting since I was 18. My mom was an actress in community theatre when I was growing up. I've always done it, but I'd always figured that I'd do it at weekends, and have a real job also. Judy is on more of a ballistic mission than I was. </p> <p><strong>Did you ever have the desire to do the LA thing like Judy? </strong></p> <p>Nah. My family's in New York, my life is there, my house is there and my friends all live within a few blocks in the West Village.

Then he would disappear for hours, and nobody would know where he was, and he'd be in the park talking to a tree.</p> <p><strong>Were you surprised how successful The Sopranos has been? </strong></p> <p>Yes. Very surprised. I still am, only because there's no telling. I was sure I wouldn't get cast, anyway, but I auditioned, and was shocked when I got the part. At that point, I had completely prepared myself to move onto the next project.

We have an extremely snooty middle class, a vociferous, boisterous working class and a nearly invisible underclass. Each is separated from its nearest neighbour by layers of well-nuanced resentment, smugness, irrational fear and mutual contempt.

It's a sickness.</p> <p>Americans would have us believe that they're past all this. They had a revolution, after all, and the Declaration of Independence enshrined social equality as a right shared by all men. But as any slave or woman could have told you in 1776, America had a class system the moment the citizenry briefly tried to make George Washington king.</p> <p>Though they're loath to admit it, Americans have a class system that in its own pseudo-egalitarian way is just as visible and divisive as the British one. We're used to decoding all the social signals that separate, say, Lucinda Lambton from Ricky Tomlinson, but unlike us, Americans don't spend much time attempting to locate precisely and minutely the dodgy social origins and non-U accents of their neighbours and co-workers. </p> <p>It's almost impossible to imagine America breeding an indigenous Mike Leigh to chronicle acute moments of social embarrassment and class awkwardness. Which is not to say these things don't exist. Cultural distance means that we're less adept at analysing those signals in a roomful of Americans, but they're still legible if you know how. Class masquerades as wealth at the top of the scale and is often displaced into race at the bottom end, but in the broad middle there are a zillion finely calibrated distinctions.</p> <p>Look at Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks, in which Brooklyn manicurist Frenchy Winkler (Tracey Ullman) suddenly finds she and her husband Ray (Allen) are rich beyond their wildest dreams and able to hobnob with a better class of person. Frenchy lusts after \"the finer things\" and hooks up with Hugh Grant's crooked art dealer, who has the very thing that guarantees class and style to many Americans: he's English. Thus he can aid her in her quest for \"quality\" and good taste, that indefinable je ne sais quoi allegedly imparted by close association with European culture and cuisine, and with British nobs (he finds her \"unspeakably vulgar\" , of course). So it is that ex-stripper Frenchy (formerly known as \"Frenchy, The Topless Wonder\" ) and ex-con and hapless thief Ray find themselves ineptly serving snails to the kind of people who, unlike them, actually know how to eat them. \"Snails leave a scum trail when they walk,\" whines Ray. \"Not in France,\" snaps Frenchy.</p> <p>The chance to express themselves through expenditure and acquisition is what brings the couple out in all their tacky glory. Money may well be the root of all evil, it may well buy you happiness, but if you have rotten cheap tastes then the one thing you can guarantee is money will find you out.</p> <p>If money can do one thing, many Americans theorise, it can go some way towards erasing the stain of one's origins. The fear that others might discover you have one foot in the trailer-park is a great motivator. Just as the British know precisely what separates South Kensington from, say, Droitwich, Americans are highly alert to the differences between Beverly Hills and Catfish Junction, Alabama - and will move heaven and earth to erase any stigma based on origin.</p> <p>Just look at the Kennedys, America's \"Royal Family\" . There wouldn't have been a President Kennedy or any senators had not their father Joseph Kennedy spent his entire life attempting to break away from his Boston Irish roots and ingratiate himself with the landed American aristocrats of Boston and New York. \"Tell me,\" Rose Kennedy is said to have asked an aristocratic schoolfriend of JFK's in 1939, when her family was already rich but beset by the wildest forms of social insecurity, \"when are the good people of Boston going to accept us Irish?\" In the end they had to accept them, if only because of the sheer force of Kennedy Sr's social ambitions. But it will take generations before the aristocracy Joe wanted his sons to join will let the Kennedys forget that their real roots are in the Irish ghetto and their past is deeply tainted by Joe Kennedy's extensive activities as a bootlegger during Prohibition.</p> <p>Similarly the moguls of young Hollywood. They feared anti-Semitism above all else and skirted it by utterly suppressing their Jewish origins both in their public lives and in the movies they oversaw down to the last detail. Having been kept out of \"respectable\" business activities by anti-Semitism on the part of the kind of people Joe Kennedy aspired to be like, they got their sweet revenge when the \"disreputable\" nickelodeons they'd bought up suddenly began to make them the richest men alive. As movies came of age in the 1930s, the moguls constructed a notion of \"class\" or classiness through the decor, the repartee, the costumes and the social attitude of their productions that came to be seen as uniquely expressive of \"The American Dream\" . Thus all of America came to dream in the terms laid out by a group of socially awkward insecure Jewish immigrants, which must have been supremely gratifying to them, even as they were kept out of gentile neighbourhoods and country clubs till well into the 60s.</p> <p>And at the top of the heap, of course, is the class that kept those country clubs \"restricted\", the class that sneered at the Kennedys' nouveau-riche aspirations, and which still largely owns and runs the United States. America's Wasp aristocracy (of which George W Bush is a Texicanised scion) is based around the Groton and Harvard-educated owners of the great banking and investment houses on Wall Street and the ancient law firms that do their bidding. This is the class Edith Wharton wrote about in The Age Of Innocence and The House Of Mirth. They're the people painted by John Singer Sargent: the Roosevelts, the Vanderbilts, the Rockefellers, the Aldriches and so on. They'd like us to believe that they're all descended from the pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower in 1620, though any fool can tell you that if everyone who claimed to be descended from the Pilgrim Fathers actually was, then the Mayflower must have been a jumbo-supertanker.

Cecil B Demented, Waters' 12th feature, is as inspired as its title, a satire that gleefully pokes fun at Hollywood while offering an alternative history lesson on the radical organisations of late 60s and early 70s America. </p> <p>Waters' would-be auteurs, the Sprocket Holes, are led by Sinclair Stevens, a Baltimore cinema manager by day, who at night becomes Cecil B Demented, guerrilla film-maker and art terrorist. As played by a manic Stephen Dorff, he's so determined to make his first film that he kidnaps A-list star Honey Whitlock, a valiant Melanie Griffith, and forces her at gunpoint to take the lead in his no-budget epic. </p> <p>From then it's an increasingly frenzied ride as the Sprockets shut down multiplexes showing the director's cut of Patch Adams, attack a Hollywood movie that's shooting locally and become cult heroes via a willing media, while all the time making their own film.</p> <p>But if Waters' targets are predictable - the rampant sentimentality and commerciality of most studio product - then his masterstroke is the way the Sprockets mimic the rhetoric and actions of now-forgotten terrorist groups like the Weathermen and the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). </p> <p>Emerging out of the anti-Vietnam war student protests of 1968 and 1969, the Weathermen, who took their name from a line in Bob Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues (\"You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows\" ), were middle-class, mostly white Marxists who in 1970 called for \"an armed struggle against the state\" and immediately went underground to do just that.

      "bodyText": "Film-makers have been biting the hand that feeds them ever since the silent days, but only John Waters would send up his trade by creating a misfit crew of cinematic revolutionaries who are so intent on cleansing the world of bad films that they'll kill anyone who gets in their way. Cecil B Demented, Waters' 12th feature, is as inspired as its title, a satire that gleefully pokes fun at Hollywood while offering an alternative history lesson on the radical organisations of late 60s and early 70s America. Waters' would-be auteurs, the Sprocket Holes, are led by Sinclair Stevens, a Baltimore cinema manager by day, who at night becomes Cecil B Demented, guerrilla film-maker and art terrorist. As played by a manic Stephen Dorff, he's so determined to make his first film that he kidnaps A-list star Honey Whitlock, a valiant Melanie Griffith, and forces her at gunpoint to take the lead in his no-budget epic. From then it's an increasingly frenzied ride as the Sprockets shut down multiplexes showing the director's cut of Patch Adams, attack a Hollywood movie that's shooting locally and become cult heroes via a willing media, while all the time making their own film. But if Waters' targets are predictable - the rampant sentimentality and commerciality of most studio product - then his masterstroke is the way the Sprockets mimic the rhetoric and actions of now-forgotten terrorist groups like the Weathermen and the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Emerging out of the anti-Vietnam war student protests of 1968 and 1969, the Weathermen, who took their name from a line in Bob Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues (\"You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows\" ), were middle-class, mostly white Marxists who in 1970 called for \"an armed struggle against the state\" and immediately went underground to do just that. Unfortunately, though, they weren't very good at the terrorist game. In fact, despite planting bombs at the Pentagon and other defence installations, the only casualties from their campaign were three of their own, who blew up themselves and their swanky Greenwich Village apartment in 1971. This is hardly surprising, given that their real talent lay in winding up middle America with outrageous slogans and a lifestyle that put the \"h\" into hedonism. Loading up on any drug they could lay their hands on, sleeping with each other in rotation and occasionally bounding on stage at rallies to announce, \"We're about being crazy motherfuckers and scaring the shit out of honky America\", the spirit of the Weathermen lives on in the Sprockets. No sex before a mission, the compulsory tattooing of their favourite directors, Preminger, Warhol, Castle and Fassbinder among them, on their arms and the endless chanting of their slogan, \"Demented Forever\", makes for a nicely paranoid and twisted group of daydreaming cine-revolutionaries.

But skiers and snowboarders comparing policies closely will discover ludicrous anomalies. </p> <p>Why does one company regard heliskiing as an extreme sport while another covers it at no additional cost? Why should one policy allow off-piste skiing without a guide, while another excludes it? And why should you get compensation when there is too little snow to ski on, but not if there is too much? </p> <p>Sometimes these absurdities appear to stem from ignorance. Ask your insurers if you are covered to go snowcat skiing. Unless you are insured by a skiing specialist, it is unlikely they will have a clue what you are talking about. </p> <p>Snowcat skiing is an option in many US and Canadian resorts. It involves travelling off piste to untracked snow by a converted piste machine and is usually cheaper than going by helicopter - but the risks are surely much the same. Yet at least one firm, which covers customers taking the cat, demands extra if they fly. </p> <p>Even between firms with acknowledged expertise there can be contradictions. Hamilton Barr, for example, will not cover heliskiing if it is booked before you travel, because of the potentially high cancellation cost. Inghams, however, will only provide cover if you pre-book, to ensure you have booked with a reputable operator. </p> <p>About two things there can be no argument. First, it would be foolish to take no insurance at all. Though many basic medical costs in Europe are covered if you take an E1-11 form, it will not pay for a mountain rescue, which could set you back around \u00a31,000 if a helicopter is needed, and it does not cover additional repatriation costs. Nor does it stretch to North America, where even a relatively minor injury can cost several hundred pounds and the average bill for torn ligaments is around \u00a32,500. </p> <p>And second, it pays to read the small print. If you plan to stick to piste skiing, there are fewer pitfalls. However, there are certain essentials you should check. Does the policy provide a decent level of liability cover - against the risk that you injure someone who then sues you? You ought to have at least \u00a31 million-worth in North America. Will it cover the hire of skis, boots or clothes if your bags go AWOL? Insurance organised by the Ski Club of Great Britain, for example, pays up to \u00a3150 if luggage is delayed - but only if it is more than 24 hours late. </p> <p>Will you get compensation if you are unable to ski? Until recently, most policies coughed up only if customers were frustrated by too little snow. </p> <p>The spate of avalanches two seasons ago caused a rethink. Some insurers now pay out if such hazards force the closure of pistes. One example is the cover organised by tour operator Inghams. It pays compensation of \u00a330 a day if all lifts are closed for any reason - provided it is not possible to transport you to alternative slopes. With admirable precision, it says baby drag lifts or those used to carry non-skiers around resorts do not count. </p> <p>It would also be wise to check whether you are covered for fringe activities, such as racing around on a snowmobile. </p> <p>For those intent on heading off piste, things become trickier. How do you define a piste? Must you stay strictly on groomed snow - or is it safe to take a few turns in the powder alongside? Insurers apply what they call the \"test of reasonableness\". Thus, if a boarder with a policy excluding off-piste skiing was injured on a jump within sight of a prepared run, it might pay out. But if the same customer strayed deep into unpatrolled territory, it probably would not. </p> <p>For regular travellers and families, an annual policy, which covers trips other than winter sports holidays, can be economic. American Express Centurion, for example, covers your children on a school trip. But never renew such policies without checking for changes. Some years ago I dis covered that off-piste skiing had been excluded from mine. The company insisted it had informed policy holders but I could not recall receiving any communication. </p> <p>Insurers often offer two levels of cover with different premiums. Sometimes it is worth paying the extra. Sometimes it is not. Whether you need more than \u00a32m worth of medical cover, for example, is debatable. Who knows of a claim for a higher amount? </p> <p>One example of souped-up cover that would be worth paying for is Hamilton Barr's Excel. At \u00a333.77 for up to 10 days in Europe or \u00a355.86 worldwide it costs only \u00a33.47 or \u00a38.33 more than the firm's respective standard policies. But it pays out up to \u00a3800 if your ski equipment is lost, damaged or stolen - double the amount covered by the cheaper policy. </p> <p>If you are stuck in hospital as the result of an accident, it will pay \u00a330 a day \"inconvenience\" cover, for expenses such as taxis to get friends to your bedside - double the standard figure.

      "body": "<p>Even after several visits, it still comes as a bit of a surprise to happen upon the broad, open fields of Laxton to the east of Ollerton in north Nottinghamshire. All around are the the hawthorn-hedged, tightly-enclosed fields so typical of the Midlands shires, punctuated here and there by copses which often provide the last refuges for wildlife. </p> <p>But as you climb up from the flood plain of the Trent to reach Laxton, which stands at just under 300ft (90m), it feels as if you have been suddenly transported from the East Midlands to the prairies of East Anglia. Horizons broaden, the hedges disappear and the sky opens up as you step back 1,000 years into a unique little bit of Old England. </p> <p>Laxton is the only village in England that still practises the open-field system of agriculture, common throughout the country during the middle ages. This amazing survival is thought to be due to the fact that the two major landowners, Earl Manvers and the Earl of Scarborough, could not reach agreement on how and where the enclosures should take place during the early 19th century. </p> <p>Although some partial enclosure did happen, by the start of the 20th century, Laxton's importance as a unique historical landscape was recognised, and the emphasis changed to the preservation of the old system, encouraged by the county council and the Countryside Agency. </p> <p>Laxton, (or Laxintune or Lexington as it has also been known) was already a well-established village by the time of the Norman conquest. Roman remains have been found at Fiddler's Balk in the West Field, and many of the names still in use, such as toft, flatt, gate and syke, are of Danish origin, showing that Scandinavian invaders also left their mark on this ancient landscape. The name comes from the Anglo-Saxon and means \"the settlement of Leaxa's people\". </p> <p>In William the Conqueror's great land register, the Domesday Book of 1086, \"Laxintune\" is already shown to be a cultivated and populous village, consisting of an adult population of around 35 villiens, bordars and serfs (including, unusually, one female serf or ancilla), supporting a total population of perhaps 100-120 people. The Domesday entry also shows that the people of Laxton were cultivating about 720 acres of arable land, with about 40 acres of pasture for mowing, and woodland providing pannage (acorns and beechmast) for pigs, and for fuel and building timber. </p> <p>The well-preserved earthworks of the Norman motte and bailey castle on the northern edge of the village date from the late 11th century, and feature an unusual extra cone on the summit of the \"motte,\" the mound on which the original timber tower was built. It was from here that King John enjoyed many weeks of good hunting in the royal Forest of Sherwood, which was then stocked with herds of deer and wild boar, packs of wolves and possibly outlaws. </p> <p>The castle proved to be a popular lodge for a succession of medieval monarchs including Henry II and Edward I. It fell into decay in the 14th century, but the Roos family built a three-gabled manor house, now also disappeared, to the south of the site in the 17th century. Today, there are spectacular views from the tree-topped motte across the marching pylons towards the great billowing cauldrons of the power stations of the Trent Valley to the east, and over the village of Laxton and its West Field. </p> <p>The village's open-field system was probably already in place by the time of Domesday. Basically, it relies on a three-field rotation system, where in any one year, one field is sown with winter wheat; the second, a spring-sown crop such as barley, and the third is left fallow. All village farmers have the right to use the land in strips or furlongs in the three great open fields of Laxton: the West Field, the Mill Field and the South Field. </p> <p>Uniquely, Laxton's open-field system is still administered by the Court Leet, a form of manorial government surviving from medieval times. On Jury Day, usually held at about this time of the year, an inspection is made of the open fields, checking that everything is in order. This is followed a week later by the Court Leet held in the Dovecote Inn, where officials and a new jury are appointed and fines are imposed. </p> <p>Our walk starts from the village car park, near the visitor centre. Turn left on to the road past the Dovecote Inn, passing the site of the walled pinfold (for impounding stray animals) in Kneesall Road. Bear right at the junction with the Moorhouse Road and, after about 200 yards, turn right by the second wooden footpath sign on to the broad, muddy trackway known as the Langsyke. </p> <p>This leads up through a gate and an avenue of young beeches into a holloway and out on to Mill Field, the largest of the three great open fields of Laxton. In the summer, if the field is in arable use, you will be able to see different crops growing in the different strips, and there are fine views right back towards the village and the church tower. </p> <p>Ascend the broad green headland for about 500 yards (550m), towards a prominent interpretive sign from which views extend, on a clear day, as far as the triple towers of Lincoln Cathedral, 17 miles away to the east. Turn sharp right at this junction on to a metalled farm track which leads out to the Ollerton Road. This is crossed and you follow a grassy, often wet holloway, turning right at the junction with another towards the end of the main street of the village, with the church tower ahead. </p> <p>Just before reaching the street, turn left on to a farm track. After about 150 yards, leave the track, turning left over a stile by a footpath sign partly hidden by the hedge. Cross another stile which leads across the West Field via Hall Lane, a wet, deeply- hedged green track.

      "bodyText": "Even after several visits, it still comes as a bit of a surprise to happen upon the broad, open fields of Laxton to the east of Ollerton in north Nottinghamshire. All around are the the hawthorn-hedged, tightly-enclosed fields so typical of the Midlands shires, punctuated here and there by copses which often provide the last refuges for wildlife. But as you climb up from the flood plain of the Trent to reach Laxton, which stands at just under 300ft (90m), it feels as if you have been suddenly transported from the East Midlands to the prairies of East Anglia. Horizons broaden, the hedges disappear and the sky opens up as you step back 1,000 years into a unique little bit of Old England. Laxton is the only village in England that still practises the open-field system of agriculture, common throughout the country during the middle ages. This amazing survival is thought to be due to the fact that the two major landowners, Earl Manvers and the Earl of Scarborough, could not reach agreement on how and where the enclosures should take place during the early 19th century. Although some partial enclosure did happen, by the start of the 20th century, Laxton's importance as a unique historical landscape was recognised, and the emphasis changed to the preservation of the old system, encouraged by the county council and the Countryside Agency. Laxton, (or Laxintune or Lexington as it has also been known) was already a well-established village by the time of the Norman conquest. Roman remains have been found at Fiddler's Balk in the West Field, and many of the names still in use, such as toft, flatt, gate and syke, are of Danish origin, showing that Scandinavian invaders also left their mark on this ancient landscape. The name comes from the Anglo-Saxon and means \"the settlement of Leaxa's people\". In William the Conqueror's great land register, the Domesday Book of 1086, \"Laxintune\" is already shown to be a cultivated and populous village, consisting of an adult population of around 35 villiens, bordars and serfs (including, unusually, one female serf or ancilla), supporting a total population of perhaps 100-120 people. The Domesday entry also shows that the people of Laxton were cultivating about 720 acres of arable land, with about 40 acres of pasture for mowing, and woodland providing pannage (acorns and beechmast) for pigs, and for fuel and building timber. The well-preserved earthworks of the Norman motte and bailey castle on the northern edge of the village date from the late 11th century, and feature an unusual extra cone on the summit of the \"motte,\" the mound on which the original timber tower was built. It was from here that King John enjoyed many weeks of good hunting in the royal Forest of Sherwood, which was then stocked with herds of deer and wild boar, packs of wolves and possibly outlaws. The castle proved to be a popular lodge for a succession of medieval monarchs including Henry II and Edward I. It fell into decay in the 14th century, but the Roos family built a three-gabled manor house, now also disappeared, to the south of the site in the 17th century. Today, there are spectacular views from the tree-topped motte across the marching pylons towards the great billowing cauldrons of the power stations of the Trent Valley to the east, and over the village of Laxton and its West Field. The village's open-field system was probably already in place by the time of Domesday. Basically, it relies on a three-field rotation system, where in any one year, one field is sown with winter wheat; the second, a spring-sown crop such as barley, and the third is left fallow. All village farmers have the right to use the land in strips or furlongs in the three great open fields of Laxton: the West Field, the Mill Field and the South Field. Uniquely, Laxton's open-field system is still administered by the Court Leet, a form of manorial government surviving from medieval times. On Jury Day, usually held at about this time of the year, an inspection is made of the open fields, checking that everything is in order. This is followed a week later by the Court Leet held in the Dovecote Inn, where officials and a new jury are appointed and fines are imposed. Our walk starts from the village car park, near the visitor centre. Turn left on to the road past the Dovecote Inn, passing the site of the walled pinfold (for impounding stray animals) in Kneesall Road. Bear right at the junction with the Moorhouse Road and, after about 200 yards, turn right by the second wooden footpath sign on to the broad, muddy trackway known as the Langsyke. This leads up through a gate and an avenue of young beeches into a holloway and out on to Mill Field, the largest of the three great open fields of Laxton. In the summer, if the field is in arable use, you will be able to see different crops growing in the different strips, and there are fine views right back towards the village and the church tower. Ascend the broad green headland for about 500 yards (550m), towards a prominent interpretive sign from which views extend, on a clear day, as far as the triple towers of Lincoln Cathedral, 17 miles away to the east. Turn sharp right at this junction on to a metalled farm track which leads out to the Ollerton Road. This is crossed and you follow a grassy, often wet holloway, turning right at the junction with another towards the end of the main street of the village, with the church tower ahead. Just before reaching the street, turn left on to a farm track. After about 150 yards, leave the track, turning left over a stile by a footpath sign partly hidden by the hedge. Cross another stile which leads across the West Field via Hall Lane, a wet, deeply- hedged green track. Follow the lane for about 500 yards, where a gate and sign leads left across a field towards the earthworks of the castle, surrounded by ageing hawthorn trees. Retrace your steps back to the lane, where you go straight ahead to arrive back into the village nearly opposite the church. The beautiful, mainly 13th-century parish church of St Michael the Archangel had, like the castle, fallen into disuse and \"impious neglect\" until it was remodelled by Earl Manvers in 1854.

      "body": "<p>The waitress is so shocked she can hardly contain herself: I'm not having wine with my lunch? After a few seconds of stunned silence, she adds with further disbelief: \"And I suppose you're not having pudding either?\" </p> <p>Okay, so I'm in France, where not partaking in the finer things in life is practically sacrilegous, but I am in a health spa. Then again, this is the world's only vinotherapy centre and it is dedicated to beauty treatments derived from grapes. Denial is definitely not on the agenda here - as well as a cellar of 13,000 wines, there's a Michelin-starred restaurant and a cigar room. You're even encouraged to join a wine-tasting session at the nearby chateau. </p> <p>The name of this unique spa is Les Sources de Caudalie, and beauticians at the centre, 15 minutes' drive from Bordeaux, believe that as well as imbibing a couple of glasses of wine a day, we should be bathed and massaged in it, too. The theory is that the humble grape pip is highly effective at countering skin damage caused by free radicals (smoking, pollution and sunlight). </p> <p>Which is why, later that afternoon, I find myself lying on a plastic sheet being slathered with wine and honey. The sheet is wrapped around me, then covered with what looks like a thermal blanket and I'm left to doze in a gloopy cocoon for 20 minutes. Not only is this baccanalian-sounding process strangely relaxing, it is meant to render me lithe, toned and youthful to boot. </p> <p>Vinotherapy is the brainchild of Mathilde Cathiard, whose parents own the Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte wine estate. With the help of dermatologists at Bordeaux university, Mathilde launched a line of skincare a few years ago, using the byproducts from her parents' wine-making business. Last year, she opened the spa and diminutive four-star hotel among the vineyards. </p> <p>Think of it as haute rustic - the appearance seems effortlessly country casual, but you can bet your life that every detail has been agonised over. The 23 bedrooms and six suites are each decorated in variations of boho chic. There's one room in a cabinesque building next to a small lake complete with a pair of swans. </p> <p>The Maison de Lievre restaurant is out here, too, in this ridiculously romantic setting. But if a seven-course dinner is too much on a health break, there's the Table du Lavoir. Described as a \"country inn\", it is a casual eaterie with such hearty fare as rabbit stew, but it is still slickly stylish. Non-residents pour in to both places and, of course, since you're not a prisoner of this particular spa, you are free to explore the culinary delights of Bordeaux. </p> <p>The spa itself is in a wooden outhouse, just a short trot from the hotel. Inside, the series of relaxation areas and beauty rooms exude a Zen-like calm - all large, airy spaces, pale wood and stone. While you're left in no doubt that vinotherapy is a serious business - the hushed silence of the spa suggests it is almost a temple to wine - the treatments themselves reveal a sense of humour. They read like a wine list - Sauvignon massage, crushed Cabernet body scrub, Merlot wrap, Premier Grand Cru facial . . . </p> <p>And although you are not exactly frolicking in wine - any chance of a Kate Moss/Johnny Depp-style champange bath is out - the vino references are very much in your face. The barrel bath, for example, is a Jacuzzi clad in wood \u00e0 la wine barrel. Powdered grape extract is added to the spa water so it is frothy and warm, but it is more like soaking in a barrel of British beer than vintage vin. From every treatment tub and table, you look out on to the 163 acres of vines through wooden-slatted windows - you can see out but no one can see in. </p> <p>Alas, the invitingly sounding red vine bath turns out to be a big white tub unnervingly similar to the tubs for the elderly and infirm you see in small ads.

      "bodyText": "The waitress is so shocked she can hardly contain herself: I'm not having wine with my lunch? After a few seconds of stunned silence, she adds with further disbelief: \"And I suppose you're not having pudding either?\" Okay, so I'm in France, where not partaking in the finer things in life is practically sacrilegous, but I am in a health spa. Then again, this is the world's only vinotherapy centre and it is dedicated to beauty treatments derived from grapes. Denial is definitely not on the agenda here - as well as a cellar of 13,000 wines, there's a Michelin-starred restaurant and a cigar room. You're even encouraged to join a wine-tasting session at the nearby chateau. The name of this unique spa is Les Sources de Caudalie, and beauticians at the centre, 15 minutes' drive from Bordeaux, believe that as well as imbibing a couple of glasses of wine a day, we should be bathed and massaged in it, too. The theory is that the humble grape pip is highly effective at countering skin damage caused by free radicals (smoking, pollution and sunlight). Which is why, later that afternoon, I find myself lying on a plastic sheet being slathered with wine and honey. The sheet is wrapped around me, then covered with what looks like a thermal blanket and I'm left to doze in a gloopy cocoon for 20 minutes. Not only is this baccanalian-sounding process strangely relaxing, it is meant to render me lithe, toned and youthful to boot. Vinotherapy is the brainchild of Mathilde Cathiard, whose parents own the Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte wine estate. With the help of dermatologists at Bordeaux university, Mathilde launched a line of skincare a few years ago, using the byproducts from her parents' wine-making business. Last year, she opened the spa and diminutive four-star hotel among the vineyards. Think of it as haute rustic - the appearance seems effortlessly country casual, but you can bet your life that every detail has been agonised over. The 23 bedrooms and six suites are each decorated in variations of boho chic. There's one room in a cabinesque building next to a small lake complete with a pair of swans. The Maison de Lievre restaurant is out here, too, in this ridiculously romantic setting. But if a seven-course dinner is too much on a health break, there's the Table du Lavoir. Described as a \"country inn\", it is a casual eaterie with such hearty fare as rabbit stew, but it is still slickly stylish. Non-residents pour in to both places and, of course, since you're not a prisoner of this particular spa, you are free to explore the culinary delights of Bordeaux. The spa itself is in a wooden outhouse, just a short trot from the hotel. Inside, the series of relaxation areas and beauty rooms exude a Zen-like calm - all large, airy spaces, pale wood and stone. While you're left in no doubt that vinotherapy is a serious business - the hushed silence of the spa suggests it is almost a temple to wine - the treatments themselves reveal a sense of humour. They read like a wine list - Sauvignon massage, crushed Cabernet body scrub, Merlot wrap, Premier Grand Cru facial . . . And although you are not exactly frolicking in wine - any chance of a Kate Moss/Johnny Depp-style champange bath is out - the vino references are very much in your face. The barrel bath, for example, is a Jacuzzi clad in wood \u00e0 la wine barrel. Powdered grape extract is added to the spa water so it is frothy and warm, but it is more like soaking in a barrel of British beer than vintage vin. From every treatment tub and table, you look out on to the 163 acres of vines through wooden-slatted windows - you can see out but no one can see in. Alas, the invitingly sounding red vine bath turns out to be a big white tub unnervingly similar to the tubs for the elderly and infirm you see in small ads. But it is quite a treat none the less. Once submerged, jets start up everywhere, resulting in a sort of turbo-charged Jacuzzi. As with all the treatments here, extracts to \"relax\", \"refine\" and \"slim\" are added so all you have to do is lie there, no effort required. Definitely my kind of exercise. My fellow guests were mainly professional couples of middle youth - impeccably preserved French women with bobbed hair and JP Todd driving shoes with their pot-bellied, expensive watch-wearing husbands.

      "body": "<p>I was not an angry young man, perhaps, since to me the angry young men were all old, 10 years or so older than I was. But I was a niggling one, an uneasy figure struggling in my Englishness, fighting to get out. The British provinces had been swallowing me like an eiderdown; America seemed the great, good place. I left, a young Nottingham intellectual with five published articles to his credit, all in journals of absolutely no importance, and sailed to Florida on a freighter. From there, I took the bus to New York, and rode in the endless elevator up to the top of the Empire State building; below was the great metropolis, looking like a gigantic waffle-iron. </p> <p>Excitement grew; I took the ferry and sailed out to the Statue of Liberty, while fireboats sprayed me with jets of water; I wandered Macy's and bought nylon shirts, then a new invention that made you ping with static electricity when you put them on and off. The Beat Generation was riding high: I went to poetry readings in gloomy bagel shops in Greenwich Village, where poets in dark glasses would look up to the ceiling and cry \"Come, little bird of poetry, fly down to me\" (actually it rarely did). I talked to deviants on benches outside New York Public Library, while dapper secretaries went by, carrying plastic Lord and Taylor's bags. It was different, exciting; yet I still didn't feel I knew what America was. </p> <p>Then one day the revelation came. I was staying with the parents of a Jewish friend in their small apartment in the Bronx. It was not a notable apartment but it did have a notable American kitchen: a shining bulbous icebox, a glinting split-level cooker, Formica worktops, a whirring blender and mixer, a toaster that threw bread in the air as if in sport, and in the middle of the sink, an object called a Dispose-All which consumed the kitchen refuse and sent it all straight to the sewage company. Commonplace now, it was a wonder of the 50s; I used to wander in there frequently, just to experience it all. One day my host came and found me there, staring down the Dispose-All's magnificent orifice, as if seeking the meaning of life. Not speaking, he opened the door of the ice-box, took out an entire uncooked chicken, thrust the chicken into the grinder, and switched on. Standing there, watching the machine consume an entire bird. I knew at last that I had seen the New World, and it worked. </p> <p>I stayed on in the States for a long time, in the American heartland, teaching freshman composition - better known as Readin' Writin', Speakin' and List'nin' - at a university in a cornfield in the midwest. Here I taught coeds in tight sweaters, cantilevered bras and Elizabeth Arden make-up, and seven-foot-tall footballers with crew cuts and huge ears, who could sit in the third row and still put up their feet on my desk (\"Duh, I didn't doe dey was mine,\" said one of them when, after five weeks, I complained). </p> <p>I taught them the simple things of life: how to use human language, how to write on pieces of paper from left to right, how to open books without splitting the spine, how to put in verbs to give a sentence the completeness of a sentence. I taught a lot, but I learned more. My students called for me in cars and took me out on dates, teaching me how to drink milkshakes; they showed me the way to the Doosie Duds, where I washed my socks, and the Piggly Wiggly, where I bought comestibles and acquired free Melamine tableware on food orders of five dollars or more. </p> <p>I thought I was growing American, though the students never quite agreed. \"Pip-pip, old chap,\" they said as they came into a class, \"Bin shootin? How's the Queen?\" Indeed, as time went by, a certain excess of Englishness crept into my character. </p> <p>Though by origin a good deal closer to Jimmy Porter than the Duke of Windsor, I acquired a degree of bearing. My old cheap Harris tweed sports jacket with plastic patches on the elbow (only Oxbridge undergraduates could afford leather) acquired a fine old glow, as if it had been carefully smoked over a peat fire by willing peasants, and then systematically stained with claret by family butlers. I became an expert in politeness, rank, the royal family, hunting, and warm beer. </p> <p>At the same time my literary ambitions were proceeding apace. For in addition to haunting the coffee bars of Nottingham, shouting about Sartre and nibbling the ears of leggy girls named Ernestine, I had spent three years being a student at a certain nameless English provincial university. A strange youth, who wore pink intellectual shirts and clip-on bow ties that kept falling off suddenly into cups of black coffee, and spent most of those three years writing a novel, about, of course, an English provincial university. I used to sit for hours in the university entrance hall, ostentatiously correcting a large sheet of proofs: \"He's a writer,\" my two or three friends would explain to any passing visitor who happened to stumble in, usually under the impression that they had found the public library. I had once seen TS Eliot, or someone very like him, emerge from the offices of Faber and Faber in Russell Square, so I felt alert to everything that was happening in the literary scene; I had even been discovered - by a college friend, the editor of the literary magazine, a man named Michael Orsler, an impressive figure who used to stand naked at the window of his room, shouting \"Sex rules the world\" to occasional passing suburban shoppers. </p> <p>Everyone assured me that a book about an English provincial university would never sell, and this confirmed me in my integrity. It was to these talents that I now turned in my office in the midwestern heartland; passing strangers, wandering close to the English department late at night, would hear the tapping of typewriter keys as I wrote down for posterity the benefits of my Anglo-American experience in articles that went to Vogue and Harper's and Punch and somehow managed to appear in print. </p> <p>It all came to an end, of course. My contract ceased after a year. I posted the final grades on the door of my office and locked myself in, while disappointed students shouted through the keyhole in fury. I said goodbye to my friends, who explained that they had not understood a word I had said all year, because of my foreign accent. I knew, with a kind of dread in my heart, that it was time to go home to England. I knew that going home was always an agony, if not a disaster; that I would miss what I had enjoyed. </p> <p>I had learned much about America, in the Doosie Duds and the Piggly Wiggly and the long car and bus journeys I had taken right across the nation, there to find more Doosie Duds, more Piggly Wigglies, more and more and more. In a dark, or at any rate decidedly ill-lit, night of the soul, I put all my Melamine tableware into my great foot-locker, heaved it lightly under one shoulder, and set off to New York City and the Cunard pier, on that most ancient of quests, the tale of return. Great liners with big red funnels still ran in those days, though plane travel was becoming fashionable in some quarters. </p> <p>Looking forward to six days of leisure, I climbed aboard the great vessel, a haven of Englishness, smelling of marchionesses, carbolic soap, and good old kippers. The freighter I had come on, all those lifetimes ago, would have made one of its lifeboats; \"Directions for Adjustment\" said the notices on the wall of the underwater tourist cabin in which I found myself, showing a picture of a very well-developed girl strapping herself into some apparatus that made her look more well developed still. </p> <p>And adjustment, after a long spell of America, was exactly what I needed. For I looked around at my fellow passengers, and the severe guardians who formed the crew. They appeared to me odd, until I realised that they were simply English. I would need to learn England all over again. </p> <p>This is an edited extract from Malcolm Bradbury's introduction to his book All Dressed Up And Nowhere To Go, his satirical look at Britain at the end of the 1950s. It was republished last month by Picador. His last novel, To The Hermitage, is also published by Picador.</p>",

But I was a niggling one, an uneasy figure struggling in my Englishness, fighting to get out. The British provinces had been swallowing me like an eiderdown; America seemed the great, good place. I left, a young Nottingham intellectual with five published articles to his credit, all in journals of absolutely no importance, and sailed to Florida on a freighter. From there, I took the bus to New York, and rode in the endless elevator up to the top of the Empire State building; below was the great metropolis, looking like a gigantic waffle-iron. Excitement grew; I took the ferry and sailed out to the Statue of Liberty, while fireboats sprayed me with jets of water; I wandered Macy's and bought nylon shirts, then a new invention that made you ping with static electricity when you put them on and off. The Beat Generation was riding high: I went to poetry readings in gloomy bagel shops in Greenwich Village, where poets in dark glasses would look up to the ceiling and cry \"Come, little bird of poetry, fly down to me\" (actually it rarely did). I talked to deviants on benches outside New York Public Library, while dapper secretaries went by, carrying plastic Lord and Taylor's bags. It was different, exciting; yet I still didn't feel I knew what America was. Then one day the revelation came. I was staying with the parents of a Jewish friend in their small apartment in the Bronx. It was not a notable apartment but it did have a notable American kitchen: a shining bulbous icebox, a glinting split-level cooker, Formica worktops, a whirring blender and mixer, a toaster that threw bread in the air as if in sport, and in the middle of the sink, an object called a Dispose-All which consumed the kitchen refuse and sent it all straight to the sewage company. Commonplace now, it was a wonder of the 50s; I used to wander in there frequently, just to experience it all. One day my host came and found me there, staring down the Dispose-All's magnificent orifice, as if seeking the meaning of life. Not speaking, he opened the door of the ice-box, took out an entire uncooked chicken, thrust the chicken into the grinder, and switched on. Standing there, watching the machine consume an entire bird. I knew at last that I had seen the New World, and it worked. I stayed on in the States for a long time, in the American heartland, teaching freshman composition - better known as Readin' Writin', Speakin' and List'nin' - at a university in a cornfield in the midwest. Here I taught coeds in tight sweaters, cantilevered bras and Elizabeth Arden make-up, and seven-foot-tall footballers with crew cuts and huge ears, who could sit in the third row and still put up their feet on my desk (\"Duh, I didn't doe dey was mine,\" said one of them when, after five weeks, I complained). I taught them the simple things of life: how to use human language, how to write on pieces of paper from left to right, how to open books without splitting the spine, how to put in verbs to give a sentence the completeness of a sentence. I taught a lot, but I learned more. My students called for me in cars and took me out on dates, teaching me how to drink milkshakes; they showed me the way to the Doosie Duds, where I washed my socks, and the Piggly Wiggly, where I bought comestibles and acquired free Melamine tableware on food orders of five dollars or more. I thought I was growing American, though the students never quite agreed. \"Pip-pip, old chap,\" they said as they came into a class, \"Bin shootin? How's the Queen?\" Indeed, as time went by, a certain excess of Englishness crept into my character. Though by origin a good deal closer to Jimmy Porter than the Duke of Windsor, I acquired a degree of bearing. My old cheap Harris tweed sports jacket with plastic patches on the elbow (only Oxbridge undergraduates could afford leather) acquired a fine old glow, as if it had been carefully smoked over a peat fire by willing peasants, and then systematically stained with claret by family butlers. I became an expert in politeness, rank, the royal family, hunting, and warm beer. At the same time my literary ambitions were proceeding apace. For in addition to haunting the coffee bars of Nottingham, shouting about Sartre and nibbling the ears of leggy girls named Ernestine, I had spent three years being a student at a certain nameless English provincial university. A strange youth, who wore pink intellectual shirts and clip-on bow ties that kept falling off suddenly into cups of black coffee, and spent most of those three years writing a novel, about, of course, an English provincial university. I used to sit for hours in the university entrance hall, ostentatiously correcting a large sheet of proofs: \"He's a writer,\" my two or three friends would explain to any passing visitor who happened to stumble in, usually under the impression that they had found the public library. I had once seen TS Eliot, or someone very like him, emerge from the offices of Faber and Faber in Russell Square, so I felt alert to everything that was happening in the literary scene; I had even been discovered - by a college friend, the editor of the literary magazine, a man named Michael Orsler, an impressive figure who used to stand naked at the window of his room, shouting \"Sex rules the world\" to occasional passing suburban shoppers. Everyone assured me that a book about an English provincial university would never sell, and this confirmed me in my integrity. It was to these talents that I now turned in my office in the midwestern heartland; passing strangers, wandering close to the English department late at night, would hear the tapping of typewriter keys as I wrote down for posterity the benefits of my Anglo-American experience in articles that went to Vogue and Harper's and Punch and somehow managed to appear in print. It all came to an end, of course. My contract ceased after a year. I posted the final grades on the door of my office and locked myself in, while disappointed students shouted through the keyhole in fury. I said goodbye to my friends, who explained that they had not understood a word I had said all year, because of my foreign accent. I knew, with a kind of dread in my heart, that it was time to go home to England. I knew that going home was always an agony, if not a disaster; that I would miss what I had enjoyed. I had learned much about America, in the Doosie Duds and the Piggly Wiggly and the long car and bus journeys I had taken right across the nation, there to find more Doosie Duds, more Piggly Wigglies, more and more and more. In a dark, or at any rate decidedly ill-lit, night of the soul, I put all my Melamine tableware into my great foot-locker, heaved it lightly under one shoulder, and set off to New York City and the Cunard pier, on that most ancient of quests, the tale of return. Great liners with big red funnels still ran in those days, though plane travel was becoming fashionable in some quarters. Looking forward to six days of leisure, I climbed aboard the great vessel, a haven of Englishness, smelling of marchionesses, carbolic soap, and good old kippers. The freighter I had come on, all those lifetimes ago, would have made one of its lifeboats; \"Directions for Adjustment\" said the notices on the wall of the underwater tourist cabin in which I found myself, showing a picture of a very well-developed girl strapping herself into some apparatus that made her look more well developed still. And adjustment, after a long spell of America, was exactly what I needed. For I looked around at my fellow passengers, and the severe guardians who formed the crew. They appeared to me odd, until I realised that they were simply English. I would need to learn England all over again. This is an edited extract from Malcolm Bradbury's introduction to his book All Dressed Up And Nowhere To Go, his satirical look at Britain at the end of the 1950s. It was republished last month by Picador. His last novel, To The Hermitage, is also published by Picador.",

He has lately published his 13th novel, Ravelstein, an exuberant tale about grand political ideas and our human mortality - not least the author's own, for in the book he discloses he has been recently faced with a life-threatening illness, for which the completion of his novel is a recompense. His central character, Abe Ravelstein, famous gay high-spending Jewish academic and political philosopher, belongs in a long line of Bellovian heroes. He is the suffering joker, a source of huge ideas and serious political wisdom, who is also a figure of clownish excess. </p> <p>Following the advice of the book's narrator, an older writer who is clearly Bellow, Ravelstein has put his inspired academic ideas into print, and suddenly made a fortune. Now he can stay in a suite at the Hotel Crillon in Paris, where the crowds outside are calling for Michael Jackson, and buy priceless jackets from Lanvin over which, in his grand carelessness, he promptly spills his espresso coffee. Ravelstein is dying of Aids, and wants to see a memoir written. </p> <p>Who better to do so than \"Chick\", who is plainly Bellow, the most superb of all recorders of the struggles of the mind in America in its age of closure and mindless plushness? Ravelstein dies, and, thanks to his wife Rosamund, Bellow lives (just). Though, Bellow writes: \"I am a great believer in the power of an unfinished work to keep you alive,\" the book now gets finished. Thus, via print, it is Ravelstein who is kept alive, and is summed up in a final image as he listens to his hi-fi: \"He loses himself in sublime music, a music in which ideas are dissolved, reflecting these ideas in the form of feeling. He carries them down into the street with him. There's an early snow on the tall shrubs, the same shrubs filled with a huge flock of parrots - the ones that escaped from cages and now build their long nest sacks in the back alleys . . . Ravelstein looks at me laughing with pleasure and astonishment, gesturing because he can't be heard in all this bird-noise.You don't easily give up a creature like Ravelstein to death.\" </p> <p>RAVELSTEIN, the chattering philosopher who points to silence, the dying man who gives life, a figure of mind, mortality and the lush vulgar wonder of our age of glossy late modernity, is a natural figure in the great gallery of Bellow's fiction, which has always been strong in thinking heroes and the climate of the times. For over 60 years Bellow has sustained the late 20th century, postmodern American record. In careful detail, every phase of a remarkable cultural growth has been recorded. </p> <p>A fiction that started out in the climate of 30s naturalism has boomed and expanded and grown extravagant to keep pace with the amazing strangeness of modern America itself. There was the dark time of Depression, the search for work, food and the right politics; then there was the mental hiatus of wartime. There was the suddenly booming postwar world, when ideological conflict grew, and America became a superpower. There was the youthful buoyancy of the age of Kennedy, then the cultural revolution of the 60s, the venture into space, the accumulation, the struggles of the mind in the \"terrific posthistorical enterprise of the 60s and 70s\", then the wealth, the mile-high apartment block, the great mall of postmodern abundance, and the era when Abe Ravelstein the philosopher shares a world and a hotel lobby with Michael Jackson. Bellow has over this time offered us various styles of fiction, yet the voice throughout has been complete and consistent, the style a distinctive tone, vernacular and metaphysical, comic and scrupulous, meditative yet narrative, euphoric yet studied. </p> <p>Bellow is a humanist, and his attempt to sustain the humanism that has always been associated with the classic seriousness and worth of fiction is one part of his power. But he is also the writer writing of a post-humanist world: the world of survivors, after Auschwitz; the world where human beings are dwarfed by the cities they live in, by the scale of their urban masses and their lower depths, by the power of science and the new cosmos, by the earth-departure sensations of a genera tion and a nation leaving the earth-mass and heading for the moon. </p> <p>Of all Bellow's novels, Herzog (first published in 1964), has the most complicated and labyrinthine structure. The book is multi-layered, mirroring the mixture of contemplation and frenzy which is the stuff of Herzog's own mind. The story offers to tell us of a few days in Herzog's life as he summers at his house in the Berkshires, an old American literary landscape, beloved of Melville and the transcendentalists, where he has settled down trying to explain, justify, make amends. </p> <p>Herzog lives in a materialist, a narcissistic, a Freudianised and a litigious modern America, where everyone seems to be administering the common medicine now known as Reality or the Truth. Herzog confronts the City of Modern Desolation, with its certainties, its indifferences, its lost futile lives, its crimes. Meanwhile he offers to fight the battles of world historical thought, searching his way beween the lessons of Tolstoy (\"To Tolstoy, freedom is entirely personal. That man is free whose condition is simple, truthful - real\") and that of Hegel (\"History, memory - that is what makes us human, that, and the knowledge of death\"). </p> <p>Herzog, for all his intellect and heart, does not of course resolve the question of the modern condition, or come to a clear philosophical conclusion. The multiplicity of realities, the irreconcilable energies of mind and sexuality, lead to no clear outcome or 10-cent synthesis. \"I go after reality in language,\" Herzog tells us, \"I put my whole heart into these constructions, but they are constructions.\" Like Ravelstein drowned in the chatter of parrots, his ideas subsumed into feeling, Herzog must make his peace. Beyond the insistent self there is also a world: beyond language there is silence and even transparency. </p> <p>HERZOG is the first of Bellow's big comedians of mental strife, the heroes of heartbreak, for whom the encounter with big America is crucial. Thinking in contemporary America, as Bellow has observed, has its own problems. A writer's task, he says, is to make thought into something else, so that it comes alive as art. \"What makes that project singularly difficult is the disheartening expansion of trained ignorance and bad thought. For, to put the matter at its baldest, we live in a thought-world, and thinking has gone very bad indeed.\" </p> <p>Bellow has made it his business to tell the story. \"Awareness was his work, extended consciousness was his line, his business, vigilance\": what Bellow says of Herzog becomes a custom, as he tells stories of the vigilant in book after book. The result is, in a sense, a spectacular comedy as the American intellectual tries, like Humboldt in Bellow's novel Humboldt's Gift, to \"fit queer American bodies . . . into art's garments\". So Humboldt \"behaved like an eccentric and a comic subject. But occasionally there was a break in his eccentricity when he stopped and thought.\" </p> <p>No modern writer has better constructed this anxious and very serious comedy, more clearly defined the encounter between thought and the labyrinth, more exactly captured the strange, Byzantine, parrot-filled meeting places of modern thought, modern heart, and modern silence. </p> <p>This is an edited extract from Malcolm Bradbury's introduction to a new edition of Herzog by Saul Bellow. It will be published by Penguin in April.</p>",

But to say that these aesthetic atrocities have destroyed Christian faith in Britain - well, steady on.</p> <p>In last week's Saturday Guardian, Wilson argued that the abolition by the Roman Catholics of the Tridentine Mass, and the modernising by the church of England of the Book Of Common Prayer, had, in some way, destroyed our faith. He lamented the loss of the \"old words, the tried and trusted words, the words which, worn and smooth like old, well-trodden stones, had been heard so often before\".</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, I attended an evensong conducted according to the Book Of Common Prayer. As a Catholic, I relished the chance to hear some beautiful old language - and so I did. But as the liturgy wore on, I realised that I was copping out. This language was not the language I speak, and so it did not need to challenge me. It sounded lovely, as does the Tridentine Mass, but failed to penetrate through the head and the heart to the uncomfortable bits of the gut which any religion needs to reach if it is to change things.</p> <p>Many people would not agree. For them, the Tridentine Mass and the Book Of Common Prayer are channels of inspiration - and, for these people, those forms of liturgy should be available. But many other Christians want to worship and hear the word of God in the language they speak every day; only in those everyday words can it be a part of their everyday world.</p> <p>According to Wilson, those people hardly exist. \"We,\" he says grandly, no longer believe that Jesus was born in a stable in Bethlehem. Only a minority of seminarians and theological students really believe that Christ became man and lived (sorry, dwelt) among us.</p> <p>Well, I don't know where Wilson has been doing his research, but the Christians I meet every day would say different. Many of us believe the lot, thank you, and we are not a minority of fanatics. A quick trawl through my address book yields a leading physicist and a top botanist who are unabashed to declare themselves Christian.</p> <p>Wilson laments that the churches \"squabble about miracles\", rather than give \"serious responses\" to the philosophical challenges of the last 200 years. What has he been reading? These issues are debated every day in universities, on Radio 4 and in the pages of my newspaper. What does he think the Vatican Observatory is up to?</p> <p>To say that Christian leaders are cowards, who dare to question concepts such as the Resurrection and the Virgin Birth, is again to miss the point of what the modern church is about. Perhaps they simply believe these things.</p> <p>Or even if they do not, perhaps they think it is more important to rock the boat over things like the relief of international debt, capital punishment and the ravages of human greed and materialism. Would Wilson rather they spent their time polishing up their Latin?</p> <p>Yes, the modern liturgy can feel like a teddy-bears' picnic, with music borrowed from Play School. Yes, the rightful attention which the church now pays to community-building and social work can lead us to forget the awesome nature of God. In our proper quest to do good for those around us, we can lose touch with that amazing force which defines goodness. And if we stop listening to God, away from the clamour of the modern Sunday service, we will lose any sense of direction. Neither approach - the worldly nor the cerebral - will work. Christianity needs both.</p> <p>To suggest, as Wilson does, that modern liturgy and the retention in the modern creeds of the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection, have killed off modern Christianity is simply untrue. For many people, the love they see in their modern, friendly priest or vicar is their key to the gentle, forgiving love of Christ.</p> <p>The stories of the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection, irrational as they may sound, complement the whole audacious, amazing business of there being a God at all. And if we lost all the Christian music which has been composed around those doctrines, Wilson's glorious liturgy might be a little quiet.</p> <p>His analysis of the impending extinction of Christianity gives the strong impression that, when it comes to faith, he just does not get it. The late Cardinal Hume used to say that the best way to know God was to sit quietly and listen. Having done that, the debate over Latin, or estuary English, in the liturgy really ceases to matter that much.</p> <p>Annabel Miller is executive editor of the Tablet</p>",

But many other Christians want to worship and hear the word of God in the language they speak every day; only in those everyday words can it be a part of their everyday world. According to Wilson, those people hardly exist. \"We,\" he says grandly, no longer believe that Jesus was born in a stable in Bethlehem. Only a minority of seminarians and theological students really believe that Christ became man and lived (sorry, dwelt) among us. Well, I don't know where Wilson has been doing his research, but the Christians I meet every day would say different. Many of us believe the lot, thank you, and we are not a minority of fanatics. A quick trawl through my address book yields a leading physicist and a top botanist who are unabashed to declare themselves Christian. Wilson laments that the churches \"squabble about miracles\", rather than give \"serious responses\" to the philosophical challenges of the last 200 years. What has he been reading? These issues are debated every day in universities, on Radio 4 and in the pages of my newspaper. What does he think the Vatican Observatory is up to? To say that Christian leaders are cowards, who dare to question concepts such as the Resurrection and the Virgin Birth, is again to miss the point of what the modern church is about. Perhaps they simply believe these things. Or even if they do not, perhaps they think it is more important to rock the boat over things like the relief of international debt, capital punishment and the ravages of human greed and materialism. Would Wilson rather they spent their time polishing up their Latin? Yes, the modern liturgy can feel like a teddy-bears' picnic, with music borrowed from Play School. Yes, the rightful attention which the church now pays to community-building and social work can lead us to forget the awesome nature of God. In our proper quest to do good for those around us, we can lose touch with that amazing force which defines goodness. And if we stop listening to God, away from the clamour of the modern Sunday service, we will lose any sense of direction. Neither approach - the worldly nor the cerebral - will work. Christianity needs both. To suggest, as Wilson does, that modern liturgy and the retention in the modern creeds of the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection, have killed off modern Christianity is simply untrue. For many people, the love they see in their modern, friendly priest or vicar is their key to the gentle, forgiving love of Christ. The stories of the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection, irrational as they may sound, complement the whole audacious, amazing business of there being a God at all. And if we lost all the Christian music which has been composed around those doctrines, Wilson's glorious liturgy might be a little quiet. His analysis of the impending extinction of Christianity gives the strong impression that, when it comes to faith, he just does not get it. The late Cardinal Hume used to say that the best way to know God was to sit quietly and listen. Having done that, the debate over Latin, or estuary English, in the liturgy really ceases to matter that much. Annabel Miller is executive editor of the Tablet",

      "body": "<p>Mike Thornton was on the top deck of a number 86 bus when the three boys boarded and started making trouble. It was a hot day in Manchester and the boys - \"beefy lads\" he says - ran the length of the bus slamming shut windows, before turning their attention to Mr Thornton. \"What's your problem?\" one demanded and 10 minutes later, the 55-year-old's nose was broken in two places and a bone in his eye socket chipped. \"No one stepped in to help,\" he says. \"The other passengers told me afterwards 'we didn't see anything, we didn't hear anything' and I couldn't believe it. I was covered in blood.\"</p> <p>This is an instance of what Jack Straw condemned this this week as \"walk on by culture\", the public's reluctance to answer pleas for help, which is being indicted in the wake of the murder of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor. The home secretary, who has made three citizen's arrests to date, upbraided the public for its failure to respond adequately when witnessing crime. While warning them not to take risks, he said: \"People do have a responsibility to help the police in their work.\"</p> <p>Last year the audit commission calculated that for every police officer on patrol there were 18,000 people, 77 miles of road, 7,500 houses, nine schools and 23 pubs. Civic responsibility, says Mr Straw, must play its part in lessening the shortfall.</p> <p>The deterrent for intervening in street crime has always been the ease with which apparently trivial situations can turn into life-threatening ones mid-flow. This week, a 34-year-old man from Glasgow was taken to hospital after trying to stop a gang of youths stoning a bus in the city's Pollock area. He is believed to have been stabbed in the chest.</p> <p>\"There's an awareness that you're liable to suffer if you're going to interfere,\" says Anthony Black, a criminal psychologist who was for 27 years head of psychological services at Broadmoor hospital.</p> <p><b> Fear</b><br></p> <p>\"Criminals will plan a crime with the general awareness that people are not going to get involved because they fear the consequences, the violence, the fact that nowadays people will be carrying some sort of a weapon.\"</p> <p>It is not only fear but embarrassment that psychologists detect in people whose conduct they refer to as \"bystander apathy\". Dr Norah Hart teaches on this subject at the centre for applied psychology at Liverpool John Moores University. \"There is the fear that they have not read the situation right and that they will may make fools of themselves,\" she says.</p> <p>\"When people aren't sure what's going on, they tend to think, maybe there's a simple explanation, maybe it's just kids larking about. This is what happened with the James Bulger case. People thought, the two boys have said he's their brother, so it must be all right.\"</p> <p><b> Embarrassment</b><br></p> <p>This attitude, says Dr Hart, is dangerously contagious. \"If an incident is taking place in a crowded area, people see that no one else is doing anything and deduce from that that there is nothing wrong, that the situation doesn't merit intervention.\"</p> <p>\"You are worried that your actions will be misinterpreted,\" says Anthony Black. \"The other day a child ran out of a shop crying 'Mummy, Mummy' and my initial reaction was to comfort her. But then I thought no, I'm going to be thought to be trying to abduct the child, so I quickly got the help of two other women.\"</p> <p>When Mike Thornton finally pulled away from his assailants and appealed to the bus driver for help, he was informed that the bus company observed a strict policy of non-confrontation. The thugs were allowed to leave the bus unchallenged.</p> <p>\"I was shocked,\" he says. \"There was a gentleman sitting further along the bus who was quite elderly but fit looking. I'm no youngster, but if it had been him getting attacked, of course I would have stepped in. Instead, this man did nothing, and after it was all over came up to me and said, 'Oh, what happened to you?' as if seeing my blood-stained shirt for the first time.</p> <p>\"There was a girl at the back of the bus and when she left she apologised to me and handed me my sunglasses. She said, 'I'm sorry, but you'll appreciate I go to the same school as the boys and didn't see anything.' I could understand her attitude, but not his. It is one thing not to intervene, but another to deny you even saw anything.\" Mr Thornton's attackers were never convicted.</p> <p>Frank Levy, a 53-year-old taxi driver from Peckham in south London, is a rare example of a man who did get involved. While driving through Holborn he passed a bank robbery in full swing in which a security guard was being held with two guns to his head. When the guard fell to the ground, Mr Levy leapt into action.</p> <p>\"Maybe I'm stupid,\" he says, \"but I saw the two gunmen and thought, why is no one doing anything? Next thing I knew, I was in.\"</p> <p>He stopped the car, chased the robbers down the street and in the ensuing scuffle was shot in the foot. \"People kept saying to me afterwards, 'You must be bloody mad, doing what you did.'

      "bodyText": "Mike Thornton was on the top deck of a number 86 bus when the three boys boarded and started making trouble. It was a hot day in Manchester and the boys - \"beefy lads\" he says - ran the length of the bus slamming shut windows, before turning their attention to Mr Thornton. \"What's your problem?\" one demanded and 10 minutes later, the 55-year-old's nose was broken in two places and a bone in his eye socket chipped. \"No one stepped in to help,\" he says. \"The other passengers told me afterwards 'we didn't see anything, we didn't hear anything' and I couldn't believe it. I was covered in blood.\" This is an instance of what Jack Straw condemned this this week as \"walk on by culture\", the public's reluctance to answer pleas for help, which is being indicted in the wake of the murder of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor. The home secretary, who has made three citizen's arrests to date, upbraided the public for its failure to respond adequately when witnessing crime. While warning them not to take risks, he said: \"People do have a responsibility to help the police in their work.\" Last year the audit commission calculated that for every police officer on patrol there were 18,000 people, 77 miles of road, 7,500 houses, nine schools and 23 pubs. Civic responsibility, says Mr Straw, must play its part in lessening the shortfall. The deterrent for intervening in street crime has always been the ease with which apparently trivial situations can turn into life-threatening ones mid-flow. This week, a 34-year-old man from Glasgow was taken to hospital after trying to stop a gang of youths stoning a bus in the city's Pollock area. He is believed to have been stabbed in the chest. \"There's an awareness that you're liable to suffer if you're going to interfere,\" says Anthony Black, a criminal psychologist who was for 27 years head of psychological services at Broadmoor hospital. Fear \"Criminals will plan a crime with the general awareness that people are not going to get involved because they fear the consequences, the violence, the fact that nowadays people will be carrying some sort of a weapon.\" It is not only fear but embarrassment that psychologists detect in people whose conduct they refer to as \"bystander apathy\". Dr Norah Hart teaches on this subject at the centre for applied psychology at Liverpool John Moores University. \"There is the fear that they have not read the situation right and that they will may make fools of themselves,\" she says. \"When people aren't sure what's going on, they tend to think, maybe there's a simple explanation, maybe it's just kids larking about. This is what happened with the James Bulger case. People thought, the two boys have said he's their brother, so it must be all right.\" Embarrassment This attitude, says Dr Hart, is dangerously contagious. \"If an incident is taking place in a crowded area, people see that no one else is doing anything and deduce from that that there is nothing wrong, that the situation doesn't merit intervention.\" \"You are worried that your actions will be misinterpreted,\" says Anthony Black. \"The other day a child ran out of a shop crying 'Mummy, Mummy' and my initial reaction was to comfort her. But then I thought no, I'm going to be thought to be trying to abduct the child, so I quickly got the help of two other women.\" When Mike Thornton finally pulled away from his assailants and appealed to the bus driver for help, he was informed that the bus company observed a strict policy of non-confrontation. The thugs were allowed to leave the bus unchallenged. \"I was shocked,\" he says. \"There was a gentleman sitting further along the bus who was quite elderly but fit looking. I'm no youngster, but if it had been him getting attacked, of course I would have stepped in. Instead, this man did nothing, and after it was all over came up to me and said, 'Oh, what happened to you?' as if seeing my blood-stained shirt for the first time. \"There was a girl at the back of the bus and when she left she apologised to me and handed me my sunglasses. She said, 'I'm sorry, but you'll appreciate I go to the same school as the boys and didn't see anything.' I could understand her attitude, but not his. It is one thing not to intervene, but another to deny you even saw anything.\" Mr Thornton's attackers were never convicted. Frank Levy, a 53-year-old taxi driver from Peckham in south London, is a rare example of a man who did get involved. While driving through Holborn he passed a bank robbery in full swing in which a security guard was being held with two guns to his head. When the guard fell to the ground, Mr Levy leapt into action. \"Maybe I'm stupid,\" he says, \"but I saw the two gunmen and thought, why is no one doing anything? Next thing I knew, I was in.\" He stopped the car, chased the robbers down the street and in the ensuing scuffle was shot in the foot. \"People kept saying to me afterwards, 'You must be bloody mad, doing what you did.' But my parents were very moral, upright citizens. \"Without me knowing they might have instilled values in me which made me take that course of action without thinking.\" In the aftermath, it transpired that the security guard had merely fainted, but Mr Levy does not regret his actions. Nonetheless he disapproves of Jack Straw's latest appeal to the public conscience. \"I think Jack Straw's got it wrong. I don't think it's up to the public to behave like that. \"People don't mind stepping in if all they're going to get is a a punch on the nose. But so many kids carry weapons these days. People don't want a knife in the stomach for their trouble.\" Related special report Policing crime Related stories 30 November: Straw appeals to public after 'evil' schoolboy murder 30 November: 'My son is dead and I am bitter' 30 November, leader: Death in Peckham 30 November: Head defends bullying record 30 November: Estate is 'one of toughest in Europe' 29 November: Death of a schoolboy 29 November: It's lawless out there Useful links Metropolitan police The home office Ofsted report: the Oliver Goldsmith primary school Local media: South London online London borough of Southwark Photographs of the North Peckham estate",

      "byline": "Rupert Jones",

      "body": "<p>It looks like many homebuyers will continue to fall foul of what's been dubbed a mortgage \"scam\" for some time to come, despite a government pledge 12 months ago to outlaw the practice. </p> <p>During the past couple of years, there has been a growing outcry about the fact that some mortgage lenders force customers to take out expensive home insurance as a condition of signing up for their cheapest home loans. </p> <p>Studies suggest that tying compulsory insurance to mortgage deals costs borrowers millions of pounds a year. Borrowers can end up forking out thousands of pounds more than necessary over their lifetime. Research has shown that insurance arranged through your mortgage provider can cost up to a third more than cover offered by a direct insurer. In fact, the extra cost can end up cancelling out the amount you're saving by taking the cheaper mortgage deal. </p> <p>In December last year, trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers said legislation to ban compulsory insurance tie-ins would be brought in \"at the earliest possible opportunity\", probably by the end of 2000. He said: \"It is important for consumers to have a genuine choice and that they are not forced into accepting an insurance policy which may not be the best deal available to them.\" </p> <p>But 12 months on and there's still no sign of a ban. The rumours are that Mr Byers's bill on consumer rights, which includes the ban, has failed to secure a slot in the Queen's Speech to parliament this coming Wednesday, which would mean the chances of new legislation appearing before the next election are slim, unless an MP can rescue it by pushing it through as a private members' bill. </p> <p>While many of the biggest lenders have scrapped the practice, there are at least 16 that still insist you buy one or more of their insurance policies if you want one of their lowest rate mortgage deals. </p> <p>Direct Line has estimated that this so-called \"bundling\" of insurance with mortgages costs the UK public around \u00a3400m a year. \"For the average homeowner this can mean needlessly paying around \u00a34,000 more for home insurance over a lifetime,\" says the company. </p> <p>Even if you are able to look around for cheaper buildings or contents cover, some lenders charge their customers a fee - typically around \u00a325-\u00a330 - if they have the temerity to arrange their insurance with another company. This tactic is clearly aimed at deterring people from shopping around for their insurance - though the lenders of course deny this, and say the fee covers the cost of checking that a policy you arrange yourself offers adequate cover. </p> <p>The DTI this week said it could not confirm or deny whether the legislation would be included in the Queen's Speech, but worryingly it appears to be backtracking on its original commitment. A spokeswoman says the situation has changed greatly over the past year in that many banks and building societies have abandoned compulsory insurance. \"There are a lot less lenders offering [insurance] tie-ins now, especially among the major players. The consumer now definitely does have a choice,\" says the DTI. </p> <p>If it does transpire that the ban has been delayed, or even dropped, the government is likely to come under fire from consumer groups and others. It could be argued it is ridiculous that while travel agents and tour operators are now forbidden from forcing people to buy travel insurance if they want to take advantage of discount holiday deals, mortgage lenders are free to insist that people buy their home insurance as a condition of obtaining their most attractive home loans. </p> <p>The Consumers' Association - which has described tying compulsory insurance to mortgages as \"a scam\" - says that sometimes borrowers are forced to buy the lender's buildings or contents cover for several years, so there is no way of knowing at the outset whether the premiums you're being charged over this period will be competitive. </p> <p>The 16 lenders still offering home loans with compulsory insurance, according to the latest issue of financial data magazine Moneyfacts, are: Clay Cross building society; Clydesdale Bank; Darlington building society; Earl Shilton building society; Leeds &amp; Holbeck building society; Leek United building society; Marsden building society; Newcastle building society; Paragon Mortgages; Principality building society; Progressive building society; Skipton building society; Teachers building society; Universal building society; Wesleyan Home Loans; and West Bromwich building society. </p> <p>Most of the big lenders have ditched this practice: the Halifax did so seven years ago. </p> <p>Lenders that have mortgages with compulsory insurance tend to argue this enables them to offer more attractive deals because of the commission they earn. The West Bromwich spoke for many when it said: \"We find customers are happy to take up compulsory insurance in exchange for a lower rate. For those customers who don't wish to take up this offer, we offer an equivalent deal without insurance at a slightly higher rate of interest.\" </p> <p>Finally, one reason why a ban could still prove problematic is that it would clash with the idea that mortgage payment protection insurance should be made compulsory. This type of insurance, also known as accident, sickness and unemployment (ASU), covers your mortgage payments if you become unemployed or are unable to work, due to an accident or illness. </p> <p>The government wants more of us to take this out because it is concerned about how many people would pay their mortgage if they lost their job, and the House of Commons social security committee recently indicated it favours forcing lenders to provide payment protection insurance as part of all mortgages. </p> <p><strong>Ask the right questions and you could save a fortune</strong></p> <p>When you're choosing a mortgage, be sure to check with the lender or adviser whether their loans come with compulsory insurance. </p> <p>The government says this is one of the 10 key questions, listed at the end, which everyone considering taking out a mortgage should ask. </p> <p>If the loan you're particularly interested in does require you to buy the lender's insurance, make sure it is clear exactly how much you would have to pay and how long you would have to take it for. It's advisable to do some homework to find out how the cost of the policy they're offering compares with what you could get by shopping around. Ring round a couple of companies or, if you have access to the internet, try one of the online insurance broking services run by companies such as <a href=\"http://www.screentrade.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Screentrade</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.theaa.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">AA</a>. </p> <p>You enter your basic details and the sites will fire back a selection of quotes from leading insurers. Screentrade has a panel of 19 insurers offering buildings and contents insurance, while the AA has 14 insurers on its site. </p> <p>If there is a big difference between what your lender is charging and what you could get by doing it yourself, you may find this cancels out much of what you would save by taking this mortgage deal. </p> <p>Screentrade says its own research has suggested that on average, lenders are charging 40% more for their buildings and contents insurance than you would pay by obtaining quotes from several insurers and going for the best one. \"You can save yourself hundreds of pounds by shopping around,\" says a spokesman. </p> <p>If you want to be completely sure you're getting a mortgage with no hidden costs or catches you may want to consider a so-called \"CAT\" mortgage offered by Abbey National, Britannia building society, Egg, Halifax, HSBC, Woolwich and Yorkshire building society among others. CAT mortgages must meet a range of government-imposed minimum standards on charges and terms, one of which is that the lender cannot insist you buy its buildings, contents or mortgage payment protection insurance. </p> <p>Other requirements are that interest must be calculated daily, not annually; with variable rate mortgages, the interest rate cannot be any higher than 2% above the Bank of England base rate; and with fixed, discounted and capped mortgages, there must be no \"lock-in\" early redemption penalties after the end of the fixed/discounted/capped period. </p> <p>But the downside of CAT-marked mortgages is that they will often not offer the most competitive rate - meeting all those requirements inevitably means they will tend to be more expensive. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the advice about shopping around for your home insurance also applies to the millions of borrowers who may have been unwittingly forking out over the odds for years by sticking with their lender's buildings or contents cover. A few minutes on the net or the phone looking at what deals are on offer from other companies could enable people to make significant savings, and in the vast majority of cases you are going to be free to sign up with another insurer. </p> <p>Research issued by the Department of Trade and Industry last week found that at least one in four people initially sign up with their mortgage lender for insurance. It also revealed just how many people have never got round to changing their insurance provider - less than a third of homeowners (30%) have switched their home insurance in the past five years </p> <p>The DTI says there are 10 questions everyone taking out a mortgage should ask to help them make an informed choice and avoid hidden traps. </p> <p> <strong> 1</strong> How much can I realistically afford to borrow? (Make sure you're clear about what you will have to pay out each month, and don't forget there are other fees and costs involved in buying a home.) </p> <p> <strong> 2</strong> How can I tell which mortgage rate is best for me? (What is the rate now and what will happen to it when the special offer period ends?) </p> <p> <strong> 3</strong> What is the best type of mortgage for me? (Ask what the jargon means, and whether the mortgage you're being offered will suit your circumstances both now and in the future.) </p> <p> <strong> 4</strong> How should I repay it? (You can go for a repayment or an interest-only mortgage, or one that's a mixture of the two.) </p> <p> <strong> 5</strong> Can I make lump sum payments to reduce the size of the loan? (Some mortgage deals are a lot more flexible than others.) </p> <p> <strong> 6</strong> Are there any redemption penalties? (How much would you have to fork out if you wanted to switch to another lender's better deal?) </p> <p> <strong> 7</strong> Does this mortgage come with compulsory insurance? </p> <p> <strong> 8</strong> What other charges will I have to pay? (Check if you'll have to pay for mortgage indemnity guarantee insurance - also known as \"MIG\" fee.) </p> <p> <strong> 9</strong> What happens if I can't pay? (Some lenders charge very high fees if you fall behind with your mortgage payments.) </p> <p> <strong> 10</strong> What about the small print? (Ask about any terms you're unsure of.) </p> <p>For full details log on to the special website, <a href=\"http://www.consumer.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">the Consumer Gateway</a>.</p> <p><strong>A case: Joe Hogg</strong></p> <p>Joe Hogg took out the lender's buildings insurance when he got his mortgage with Bank of Scotland around 15 years ago. </p> <p>Several years passed and then in 1998, when the bank sent him a renewal quote of \u00a3124 for just buildings cover, Mr Hogg, 42, of Edinburgh, decided to shop around to see if he could get a better deal. </p> <p>He signed up with Tesco Personal Finance after they gave him a quote for buildings and contents cover of \u00a398.80. \"I just wish we had done it earlier,\" he says. </p> <p>The amount Bank of Scotland charged him had \"gradually climbed up\" each year, he adds. \"We have stuck with Tesco.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It looks like many homebuyers will continue to fall foul of what's been dubbed a mortgage \"scam\" for some time to come, despite a government pledge 12 months ago to outlaw the practice. During the past couple of years, there has been a growing outcry about the fact that some mortgage lenders force customers to take out expensive home insurance as a condition of signing up for their cheapest home loans. Studies suggest that tying compulsory insurance to mortgage deals costs borrowers millions of pounds a year. Borrowers can end up forking out thousands of pounds more than necessary over their lifetime. Research has shown that insurance arranged through your mortgage provider can cost up to a third more than cover offered by a direct insurer. In fact, the extra cost can end up cancelling out the amount you're saving by taking the cheaper mortgage deal. In December last year, trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers said legislation to ban compulsory insurance tie-ins would be brought in \"at the earliest possible opportunity\", probably by the end of 2000. He said: \"It is important for consumers to have a genuine choice and that they are not forced into accepting an insurance policy which may not be the best deal available to them.\" But 12 months on and there's still no sign of a ban. The rumours are that Mr Byers's bill on consumer rights, which includes the ban, has failed to secure a slot in the Queen's Speech to parliament this coming Wednesday, which would mean the chances of new legislation appearing before the next election are slim, unless an MP can rescue it by pushing it through as a private members' bill. While many of the biggest lenders have scrapped the practice, there are at least 16 that still insist you buy one or more of their insurance policies if you want one of their lowest rate mortgage deals. Direct Line has estimated that this so-called \"bundling\" of insurance with mortgages costs the UK public around \u00a3400m a year. \"For the average homeowner this can mean needlessly paying around \u00a34,000 more for home insurance over a lifetime,\" says the company. Even if you are able to look around for cheaper buildings or contents cover, some lenders charge their customers a fee - typically around \u00a325-\u00a330 - if they have the temerity to arrange their insurance with another company. This tactic is clearly aimed at deterring people from shopping around for their insurance - though the lenders of course deny this, and say the fee covers the cost of checking that a policy you arrange yourself offers adequate cover. The DTI this week said it could not confirm or deny whether the legislation would be included in the Queen's Speech, but worryingly it appears to be backtracking on its original commitment. A spokeswoman says the situation has changed greatly over the past year in that many banks and building societies have abandoned compulsory insurance. \"There are a lot less lenders offering [insurance] tie-ins now, especially among the major players. The consumer now definitely does have a choice,\" says the DTI. If it does transpire that the ban has been delayed, or even dropped, the government is likely to come under fire from consumer groups and others. It could be argued it is ridiculous that while travel agents and tour operators are now forbidden from forcing people to buy travel insurance if they want to take advantage of discount holiday deals, mortgage lenders are free to insist that people buy their home insurance as a condition of obtaining their most attractive home loans. The Consumers' Association - which has described tying compulsory insurance to mortgages as \"a scam\" - says that sometimes borrowers are forced to buy the lender's buildings or contents cover for several years, so there is no way of knowing at the outset whether the premiums you're being charged over this period will be competitive. The 16 lenders still offering home loans with compulsory insurance, according to the latest issue of financial data magazine Moneyfacts, are: Clay Cross building society; Clydesdale Bank; Darlington building society; Earl Shilton building society; Leeds &amp; Holbeck building society; Leek United building society; Marsden building society; Newcastle building society; Paragon Mortgages; Principality building society; Progressive building society; Skipton building society; Teachers building society; Universal building society; Wesleyan Home Loans; and West Bromwich building society. Most of the big lenders have ditched this practice: the Halifax did so seven years ago. Lenders that have mortgages with compulsory insurance tend to argue this enables them to offer more attractive deals because of the commission they earn. The West Bromwich spoke for many when it said: \"We find customers are happy to take up compulsory insurance in exchange for a lower rate. For those customers who don't wish to take up this offer, we offer an equivalent deal without insurance at a slightly higher rate of interest.\" Finally, one reason why a ban could still prove problematic is that it would clash with the idea that mortgage payment protection insurance should be made compulsory. This type of insurance, also known as accident, sickness and unemployment (ASU), covers your mortgage payments if you become unemployed or are unable to work, due to an accident or illness. The government wants more of us to take this out because it is concerned about how many people would pay their mortgage if they lost their job, and the House of Commons social security committee recently indicated it favours forcing lenders to provide payment protection insurance as part of all mortgages. Ask the right questions and you could save a fortune When you're choosing a mortgage, be sure to check with the lender or adviser whether their loans come with compulsory insurance. The government says this is one of the 10 key questions, listed at the end, which everyone considering taking out a mortgage should ask. If the loan you're particularly interested in does require you to buy the lender's insurance, make sure it is clear exactly how much you would have to pay and how long you would have to take it for. It's advisable to do some homework to find out how the cost of the policy they're offering compares with what you could get by shopping around. Ring round a couple of companies or, if you have access to the internet, try one of the online insurance broking services run by companies such as Screentrade or the AA. You enter your basic details and the sites will fire back a selection of quotes from leading insurers. Screentrade has a panel of 19 insurers offering buildings and contents insurance, while the AA has 14 insurers on its site. If there is a big difference between what your lender is charging and what you could get by doing it yourself, you may find this cancels out much of what you would save by taking this mortgage deal. Screentrade says its own research has suggested that on average, lenders are charging 40% more for their buildings and contents insurance than you would pay by obtaining quotes from several insurers and going for the best one. \"You can save yourself hundreds of pounds by shopping around,\" says a spokesman. If you want to be completely sure you're getting a mortgage with no hidden costs or catches you may want to consider a so-called \"CAT\" mortgage offered by Abbey National, Britannia building society, Egg, Halifax, HSBC, Woolwich and Yorkshire building society among others. CAT mortgages must meet a range of government-imposed minimum standards on charges and terms, one of which is that the lender cannot insist you buy its buildings, contents or mortgage payment protection insurance. Other requirements are that interest must be calculated daily, not annually; with variable rate mortgages, the interest rate cannot be any higher than 2% above the Bank of England base rate; and with fixed, discounted and capped mortgages, there must be no \"lock-in\" early redemption penalties after the end of the fixed/discounted/capped period. But the downside of CAT-marked mortgages is that they will often not offer the most competitive rate - meeting all those requirements inevitably means they will tend to be more expensive. Meanwhile, the advice about shopping around for your home insurance also applies to the millions of borrowers who may have been unwittingly forking out over the odds for years by sticking with their lender's buildings or contents cover. A few minutes on the net or the phone looking at what deals are on offer from other companies could enable people to make significant savings, and in the vast majority of cases you are going to be free to sign up with another insurer. Research issued by the Department of Trade and Industry last week found that at least one in four people initially sign up with their mortgage lender for insurance. It also revealed just how many people have never got round to changing their insurance provider - less than a third of homeowners (30%) have switched their home insurance in the past five years The DTI says there are 10 questions everyone taking out a mortgage should ask to help them make an informed choice and avoid hidden traps. 1 How much can I realistically afford to borrow? (Make sure you're clear about what you will have to pay out each month, and don't forget there are other fees and costs involved in buying a home.) 2 How can I tell which mortgage rate is best for me? (What is the rate now and what will happen to it when the special offer period ends?) 3 What is the best type of mortgage for me? (Ask what the jargon means, and whether the mortgage you're being offered will suit your circumstances both now and in the future.) 4 How should I repay it? (You can go for a repayment or an interest-only mortgage, or one that's a mixture of the two.) 5 Can I make lump sum payments to reduce the size of the loan? (Some mortgage deals are a lot more flexible than others.) 6 Are there any redemption penalties? (How much would you have to fork out if you wanted to switch to another lender's better deal?) 7 Does this mortgage come with compulsory insurance? 8 What other charges will I have to pay? (Check if you'll have to pay for mortgage indemnity guarantee insurance - also known as \"MIG\" fee.) 9 What happens if I can't pay? (Some lenders charge very high fees if you fall behind with your mortgage payments.) 10 What about the small print? (Ask about any terms you're unsure of.) For full details log on to the special website, the Consumer Gateway. A case: Joe Hogg Joe Hogg took out the lender's buildings insurance when he got his mortgage with Bank of Scotland around 15 years ago. Several years passed and then in 1998, when the bank sent him a renewal quote of \u00a3124 for just buildings cover, Mr Hogg, 42, of Edinburgh, decided to shop around to see if he could get a better deal. He signed up with Tesco Personal Finance after they gave him a quote for buildings and contents cover of \u00a398.80. \"I just wish we had done it earlier,\" he says. The amount Bank of Scotland charged him had \"gradually climbed up\" each year, he adds. \"We have stuck with Tesco.\"",

      "body": "<p><br><strong>Address: </strong>Pug and Gravy, Chiswick</p> <p>Does anyone pay any attention to what critics write? I popped into Gravy, a new Brit-style pastiche bistro in Chiswick for lunch, shortly after Fay Maschler had given it a fearsome pasting in her column in the Evening Standard, deriding in particular its version of modern British cooking. </p> <p>As I sat over my snack, Gravy filled up, until people were practically slopping over into the street outside. Were they, like myself, there out of curiosity, to see if a restaurant could be as bad as Ms Maschler had written? Or could it be that they were truly indifferent to scrappy, if anxious-to-please, service, dire food (ill-assorted seared salmon with salad, gherkins, caperberries and shallots; chewy calf's liver with anonymous parsley mash and burnt-tasting thyme gravy) and cud green walls? </p> <p>I was completely baffled. They appeared to be having a whale of a time, so perhaps it's true that we don't really care about the basic decencies of eating when two courses for lunch costs \u00a39.50. </p> <p>But Chiswick's gastronomic reputation is in safer hands at Pug, further along the High Street. This is an altogether different item, and evidently it has not been put together on a shoestring budget. The dining room is what you'd call contemporary smart; that is, large and classless, in that crisp, bright, shiny way, with pale Granny Smith-green walls, corn-coloured wooden floor and brown leather chairs, nice, bright waitresses in classic apron, shirt and trouser gear, and plenty of noise bounding off the hard surfaces to build up the buzz. There's a big bar and a lounge ,where you can eat as well as drink, and a semi-open-plan kitchen. It runs with steady confidence, even though it was scarcely unwrapped when I went there for a solitary supper. </p> <p>Every so often, I like a solitary supper, if you can be solitary with the teeming pages of Moby Dick open before you on the table. It may limit the number of courses that I can try, but - and this may come as a surprise to some of you - I don't really like making a complete pig of myself on every occasion. So it was the poached duck's egg salad with crispy chorizo and Parmesan croutons, followed by grilled chicken with roasted pumpkin, pumpkin seeds and gravy, followed by a bitter chocolate pot with Charbelli biscuits. </p> <p>This is the kind of food that goes under the general heading of modern European, I suppose, as opposed to modern British, although the difference between them is a how-many-angels-can-you-get- on-the-head-of-a-pin kind of debate. Sometimes I have trouble with the fluid nature of some so-called modern cooking, because too often it doesn't seem to be rooted in any discernible culture, and the taste of the chef is so dubious as to render all ingredients to a kind of indeterminate mish-mash. </p> <p>Brian Baker, the chef/proprietor of Pug, is a man who has been round the block a few times (Hambleton Hall, The Criterion, The Abingdon, The Depot, and two years as Sir Elton John's private chef), and he has a fair idea of what works and what doesn't. The kitchen has its feet firmly on mainland Europe, even if occasionally the menu strays into the Middle East, as with Moroccan-spiced lamb with herb and lime couscous, or even as far afield as the Far East with a honey and soy dressing for a mushroom and goat's cheese salad. </p> <p>Each dish had a clear sense of identity based on sound technical skill and sensible gastronomic ambitions. In other words, it tasted good. The salad base was a fine mix of good quality leaves complemented by a fine dressing. The emollient egg and the saucy chorizo performed a bit of a ying and yang act to add interest, while the challengingly sized Parmesan croutons added a touch of ballast. </p> <p>The grilled chicken and roasted pumpkin was more thought- provoking, but not what you would call seriously novel. The meat was from a bird of good breeding, and it had been expertly cooked to give nice burnt bits on the outside and nice succulent bits on the inside. </p> <p>Pumpkin in the roasted form has a mild earthiness that sits well with burnt chicken. In addition, there were a couple of slivers of crisp pancetta, which served to introduce a salty note, and a good gravy to round things off. It would be a mistake to over-analyse a dish of this kind, but it is right to appreciate the intelligence that goes into devising it. </p> <p>The bitter chocolate pot finished off the theme of warm comfort very nicely, the chocolate having just enough bitterness and concentration to take the edge off the richness. There was a sensible wine list, and my bill came to \u00a325, which included a couple of glasses of wine, water and coffee. </p> <p>There is a set lunch, two courses for \u00a39.95 - not far off the price for the same offering at Gravy, but with the cooking and service in a different league. There's also a three-course dinner currently available for \u00a314.95, which shows a worrying upward price trend - the press release at opening quoted three courses for \u00a313.50, but it had reached \u00a314.50 on the night I went there, and has continued to rise since. </p> <p>In spite of this, Pug represents both a handsome and intelligent addition to the eating scene. Just in case anyone wants to know.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Address: Pug and Gravy, Chiswick Does anyone pay any attention to what critics write? I popped into Gravy, a new Brit-style pastiche bistro in Chiswick for lunch, shortly after Fay Maschler had given it a fearsome pasting in her column in the Evening Standard, deriding in particular its version of modern British cooking. As I sat over my snack, Gravy filled up, until people were practically slopping over into the street outside. Were they, like myself, there out of curiosity, to see if a restaurant could be as bad as Ms Maschler had written? Or could it be that they were truly indifferent to scrappy, if anxious-to-please, service, dire food (ill-assorted seared salmon with salad, gherkins, caperberries and shallots; chewy calf's liver with anonymous parsley mash and burnt-tasting thyme gravy) and cud green walls? I was completely baffled. They appeared to be having a whale of a time, so perhaps it's true that we don't really care about the basic decencies of eating when two courses for lunch costs \u00a39.50. But Chiswick's gastronomic reputation is in safer hands at Pug, further along the High Street. This is an altogether different item, and evidently it has not been put together on a shoestring budget. The dining room is what you'd call contemporary smart; that is, large and classless, in that crisp, bright, shiny way, with pale Granny Smith-green walls, corn-coloured wooden floor and brown leather chairs, nice, bright waitresses in classic apron, shirt and trouser gear, and plenty of noise bounding off the hard surfaces to build up the buzz. There's a big bar and a lounge ,where you can eat as well as drink, and a semi-open-plan kitchen. It runs with steady confidence, even though it was scarcely unwrapped when I went there for a solitary supper. Every so often, I like a solitary supper, if you can be solitary with the teeming pages of Moby Dick open before you on the table. It may limit the number of courses that I can try, but - and this may come as a surprise to some of you - I don't really like making a complete pig of myself on every occasion. So it was the poached duck's egg salad with crispy chorizo and Parmesan croutons, followed by grilled chicken with roasted pumpkin, pumpkin seeds and gravy, followed by a bitter chocolate pot with Charbelli biscuits. This is the kind of food that goes under the general heading of modern European, I suppose, as opposed to modern British, although the difference between them is a how-many-angels-can-you-get- on-the-head-of-a-pin kind of debate. Sometimes I have trouble with the fluid nature of some so-called modern cooking, because too often it doesn't seem to be rooted in any discernible culture, and the taste of the chef is so dubious as to render all ingredients to a kind of indeterminate mish-mash. Brian Baker, the chef/proprietor of Pug, is a man who has been round the block a few times (Hambleton Hall, The Criterion, The Abingdon, The Depot, and two years as Sir Elton John's private chef), and he has a fair idea of what works and what doesn't. The kitchen has its feet firmly on mainland Europe, even if occasionally the menu strays into the Middle East, as with Moroccan-spiced lamb with herb and lime couscous, or even as far afield as the Far East with a honey and soy dressing for a mushroom and goat's cheese salad. Each dish had a clear sense of identity based on sound technical skill and sensible gastronomic ambitions. In other words, it tasted good. The salad base was a fine mix of good quality leaves complemented by a fine dressing. The emollient egg and the saucy chorizo performed a bit of a ying and yang act to add interest, while the challengingly sized Parmesan croutons added a touch of ballast. The grilled chicken and roasted pumpkin was more thought- provoking, but not what you would call seriously novel. The meat was from a bird of good breeding, and it had been expertly cooked to give nice burnt bits on the outside and nice succulent bits on the inside. Pumpkin in the roasted form has a mild earthiness that sits well with burnt chicken. In addition, there were a couple of slivers of crisp pancetta, which served to introduce a salty note, and a good gravy to round things off. It would be a mistake to over-analyse a dish of this kind, but it is right to appreciate the intelligence that goes into devising it. The bitter chocolate pot finished off the theme of warm comfort very nicely, the chocolate having just enough bitterness and concentration to take the edge off the richness. There was a sensible wine list, and my bill came to \u00a325, which included a couple of glasses of wine, water and coffee. There is a set lunch, two courses for \u00a39.95 - not far off the price for the same offering at Gravy, but with the cooking and service in a different league. There's also a three-course dinner currently available for \u00a314.95, which shows a worrying upward price trend - the press release at opening quoted three courses for \u00a313.50, but it had reached \u00a314.50 on the night I went there, and has continued to rise since. In spite of this, Pug represents both a handsome and intelligent addition to the eating scene. Just in case anyone wants to know.",

      "body": "<p>One day, predicted the New Musical Express, pop will eat itself. That day could come next month when ITV reveals the true level of manipulation, deceit and subterfuge behind the creation of a pop band - with the complicity of the performers, a record company and, it is hoped, the viewers. </p> <p>In an extraordinary exercise in counter-intuition, the network will screen Popstars, a 13-part series charting the creation of a teen band, from auditions, through rehearsals, to the release of a single. If all goes to plan and fiction turns into reality, the new stars should have a number one hit by the end of the run. </p> <p>The format has already been a hit in Australia, where it was shown earlier this year. The programme was extended, and the all-girl band, Bardot, became a sensation. Their single and album shot to the top of the charts, the group was the talk of television shows and featured on the cover of magazines and newspapers. </p> <p>ITV is investing heavily in the British version of the show, which it believes will become an equally talked-about success. Network chiefs have identified Popstars as one of their three priority projects next year and the hype is about to start. David Liddiment, the ITV director of programmes, says it is part of his strategy to promote \"event-TV\". </p> <p>The initial episodes of the series follow the thousands of hopefuls who audition for the programme. Viewers will see executives from the record company Polydor, marketeers and television producers agonise over which characters to choose; while the trauma of rejection and joy of success are minutely exposed. </p> <p>Then, the focus narrows on the band itself as a name is chosen and an image created. Cameras track the rehearsals, fitness routines and daily lives of the performers, who by this time will be living together. Finally, reality takes over as a CD is released and Polydor's promotion starts. The band will break out of the confines of the programme and, ITV hopes, become a musical sensation in their own right. </p> <p>Conrad Green, the series producer for LWT, which is making the programme for ITV, believes the show exposes the reality behind the creation of modern pop music. \"I would argue that it is more real than most bands, because you see everything that goes on. We don't pretend that they are like John, Paul and Ringo who happened to meet each other. Instead, we give these people the opportunity to meet each other when they might never have met anyone else in their town who can sing, or dance, or write songs.\" </p> <p>Mr Green, who was series editor of the reality TV sensation Big Brother, for Channel 4, said he had no idea whether the new show would have the same impact that it had in Australia. \"Hopefully it will grip people, because human stories are gripping. Showbusiness is something that fascinates people.\" </p> <p>More than 2,000 people have already been auditioned and the first part of the series is already in production. It is expected that Britain's Popstars band will feature a mixture of young men and women, but the final selection has yet to be made. </p> <p>Jason Volbeda, the publicist who hyped the show for the Seven network in Australia, said it was an instant hit. \"It was down to a range of elements: on one level it is pure voyeurism, in the sense that anyone who has stood in front of a mirror with a hairbrush can relate to. </p> <p>\"There are also excruciating moments - it's 'train-wreck TV' that you're compelled to watch. And you see the tantrums and egos, you get involved with the finalists and get emotionally attached to them. We open the door to the music world, and viewers see how much really is manufactured.\" </p> <p><strong>Ones we made earlier</strong></p> <p><strong> The Monkees</strong> Created out of Beatlemania in the 1960s, the clones had their own children's TV show from which they launched a series of hits. </p> <p><strong> PJ and Duncan</strong> The short-lived pop career of Ant and Dec grew out of their characters in the BBC children's drama Byker Grove. </p> <p><strong> The Banned</strong> Even shorter-lived spawn of EastEnders. Best not to go there. </p> <p><strong> S Club 7</strong> A revamped version of the Monkees, this time with four girls and three boys. Started with a TV show, now the band is a hit in its own right. Made the cover of FHM magazine this month.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One day, predicted the New Musical Express, pop will eat itself. That day could come next month when ITV reveals the true level of manipulation, deceit and subterfuge behind the creation of a pop band - with the complicity of the performers, a record company and, it is hoped, the viewers. In an extraordinary exercise in counter-intuition, the network will screen Popstars, a 13-part series charting the creation of a teen band, from auditions, through rehearsals, to the release of a single. If all goes to plan and fiction turns into reality, the new stars should have a number one hit by the end of the run. The format has already been a hit in Australia, where it was shown earlier this year. The programme was extended, and the all-girl band, Bardot, became a sensation. Their single and album shot to the top of the charts, the group was the talk of television shows and featured on the cover of magazines and newspapers. ITV is investing heavily in the British version of the show, which it believes will become an equally talked-about success. Network chiefs have identified Popstars as one of their three priority projects next year and the hype is about to start. David Liddiment, the ITV director of programmes, says it is part of his strategy to promote \"event-TV\". The initial episodes of the series follow the thousands of hopefuls who audition for the programme. Viewers will see executives from the record company Polydor, marketeers and television producers agonise over which characters to choose; while the trauma of rejection and joy of success are minutely exposed. Then, the focus narrows on the band itself as a name is chosen and an image created. Cameras track the rehearsals, fitness routines and daily lives of the performers, who by this time will be living together. Finally, reality takes over as a CD is released and Polydor's promotion starts. The band will break out of the confines of the programme and, ITV hopes, become a musical sensation in their own right. Conrad Green, the series producer for LWT, which is making the programme for ITV, believes the show exposes the reality behind the creation of modern pop music. \"I would argue that it is more real than most bands, because you see everything that goes on. We don't pretend that they are like John, Paul and Ringo who happened to meet each other. Instead, we give these people the opportunity to meet each other when they might never have met anyone else in their town who can sing, or dance, or write songs.\" Mr Green, who was series editor of the reality TV sensation Big Brother, for Channel 4, said he had no idea whether the new show would have the same impact that it had in Australia. \"Hopefully it will grip people, because human stories are gripping. Showbusiness is something that fascinates people.\" More than 2,000 people have already been auditioned and the first part of the series is already in production. It is expected that Britain's Popstars band will feature a mixture of young men and women, but the final selection has yet to be made. Jason Volbeda, the publicist who hyped the show for the Seven network in Australia, said it was an instant hit. \"It was down to a range of elements: on one level it is pure voyeurism, in the sense that anyone who has stood in front of a mirror with a hairbrush can relate to. \"There are also excruciating moments - it's 'train-wreck TV' that you're compelled to watch. And you see the tantrums and egos, you get involved with the finalists and get emotionally attached to them. We open the door to the music world, and viewers see how much really is manufactured.\" Ones we made earlier The Monkees Created out of Beatlemania in the 1960s, the clones had their own children's TV show from which they launched a series of hits. PJ and Duncan The short-lived pop career of Ant and Dec grew out of their characters in the BBC children's drama Byker Grove. The Banned Even shorter-lived spawn of EastEnders. Best not to go there. S Club 7 A revamped version of the Monkees, this time with four girls and three boys. Started with a TV show, now the band is a hit in its own right. Made the cover of FHM magazine this month.",

      "bodyText": "Five thousand miles from Moscow in sub-zero temperatures, hundreds of women and children in Russia's far east blocked the main Pacific roads yesterday to protest at the impact of a regional energy crisis. With children dying as a result of power cuts and temperatures sinking below -30C (-22F), around 500 protesters blockaded the main routes linking the regional capital, Vladivostok, to other towns. Energy crises have become an annual fixture in the region, as a result of embezzlement, unpaid bills, fuel shortages, collapsing infrastructure, and misrule. But the crisis is worse this year, with some 60% of the power supply infrastructure said to be in ruins. The regional governor, Yevgeny Nazdratenko, has long been at odds with the Kremlin. His administration and local councils loyal to him have failed to lay in enough coal and fuel for the winter, nor have they carried out repairs. But with the governor well entrenched, the crisis has become a major test of authority for President Vladimir Putin.",

      "bodyText": "The arguments over affordable life-saving medicines for the developing world intensified yesterday when it was revealed that the multinational pharmaceutical company Glaxo-Wellcome has blocked imports of cheap copies of one of its Aids drugs into Ghana. The revelation came as South Africa announced it had done a deal with a second company, Pfizer, over supplies of the drug Fluconazole to treat infections such as meningitis that often kill people whose immune systems are wrecked by the Aids virus HIV. Under pressure from campaigners, who began bringing a cheaper version of the patent-protected branded drug into South Africa which massively undercut the usual Pfizer price, the company has agreed to supply Fluconazole free. But although aid organisations such as the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) hailed the deal as an example of what can be achieved if countries show a willingness to turn their back on the pharmaceutical giants and buy copies, Britain made it clear yesterday that it was not in favour of such tactics. Trade minister Richard Caborn told activists from the London-based organisation Action for Southern Africa (Actsa) that such measures \"are not the answer here\". Campaigners insist that developing countries must use every possible means to get hold of affordable drugs that can stop people dying. But western governments say the companies have a right to protection for the drugs they sell at high prices in order, the companies argue, to recoup research and development costs.

It is argued by campaigners that impoverished countries faced with a health emergency have a right under international trade legislation to buy generic drugs. The African Regional Industrial Property Organisation was quoted yesterday as saying that if Glaxo went to court, it believed it would lose.

It also demanded the return of all MI5 documents Mr Shayler gave to the newspaper. The decision to abandon the writ was announced in the high court during a hearing of arguments relating to Mr Shayler's secrets trial, which has been set down for next April.",

Looking out over palm-fringed promenades, they will spend three, perhaps four difficult days and probably nights putting the finishing touches to a new treaty which will shape the union for decades to come. No dramatic changes are planned, certainly nothing to compare with the single currency, agreed at Maastricht in 1991.</p> <p>But several long-overdue reforms have to be agreed to prevent creaking institutional and decision-making machinery, first created for the six founding members in 1957, from seizing up when the union expands: 13 countries, from Poland to Turkey and Malta to Estonia, are queueing up to join the 15 states. Without these changes, enlargement cannot proceed.</p> <p>Most of the issues are highly technical. But shorn of detail they are about raw power: who decides, and how. Big players such as French president Jacques Chirac and Germany's Gerhard Schr\u00f6der have to take on board the worries of smaller ones such as Denmark, Portugal and Finland, resentful at being bullied.</p> <p>Two or three countries are happy to pool sovereignty and integrate further. But each is fighting its national corner too. Each leader has impassable red lines. The outcome is likely to be a carefully-packaged fudge. Failure is unthinkable.</p> <p><b> Vote re-weighting</b></p> <p>The big four - Germany, Britain, France, and Italy - agree on the need to re-weight votes in the council of ministers - where the 15 governments cooperate - to avoid being outvoted by smaller states when the doors open to admit the enlargement candidates. Currently 62 votes out of a total of 87 are required to block a proposal. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der wants more votes to reflect the fact that with a post-reunification population of 82m Germany has 20m more people than the other big three. All now have 10 votes. Luxembourg, population 400,000, has two. Spain, a famously tough negotiator, wants more to reflect its medium size. The Netherlands with 15.8m people wants more than Belgium, Portugal and Greece (each 10m). Most states support a double majority voting system where decisions would require both a majority of weighted votes and a majority of the EU's population.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair and his fellow European Union leaders gather in Nice next week for a summit whose outcome is vital for the future of Europe. Looking out over palm-fringed promenades, they will spend three, perhaps four difficult days and probably nights putting the finishing touches to a new treaty which will shape the union for decades to come. No dramatic changes are planned, certainly nothing to compare with the single currency, agreed at Maastricht in 1991. But several long-overdue reforms have to be agreed to prevent creaking institutional and decision-making machinery, first created for the six founding members in 1957, from seizing up when the union expands: 13 countries, from Poland to Turkey and Malta to Estonia, are queueing up to join the 15 states. Without these changes, enlargement cannot proceed. Most of the issues are highly technical. But shorn of detail they are about raw power: who decides, and how. Big players such as French president Jacques Chirac and Germany's Gerhard Schr\u00f6der have to take on board the worries of smaller ones such as Denmark, Portugal and Finland, resentful at being bullied. Two or three countries are happy to pool sovereignty and integrate further. But each is fighting its national corner too. Each leader has impassable red lines. The outcome is likely to be a carefully-packaged fudge. Failure is unthinkable. Vote re-weighting The big four - Germany, Britain, France, and Italy - agree on the need to re-weight votes in the council of ministers - where the 15 governments cooperate - to avoid being outvoted by smaller states when the doors open to admit the enlargement candidates. Currently 62 votes out of a total of 87 are required to block a proposal. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der wants more votes to reflect the fact that with a post-reunification population of 82m Germany has 20m more people than the other big three. All now have 10 votes. Luxembourg, population 400,000, has two. Spain, a famously tough negotiator, wants more to reflect its medium size. The Netherlands with 15.8m people wants more than Belgium, Portugal and Greece (each 10m). Most states support a double majority voting system where decisions would require both a majority of weighted votes and a majority of the EU's population. Sweden wants to use the square root of a country's population: this would give Germany nine votes, France seven. \"Our formula has the advantage of being easy to understand by public opinion and practical to use in an enlarged Europe,\" said prime minister Goran Persson. \"It is transparent, logical and loyal. Maybe that is why it does not please everybody.\" Compromise could lie in a proposal to treble each country's existing votes, then readjust them in favour of Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. That way, every leader could claim to have increased his country's vote. But the 14, and most importantly, France, would have to accept Germany has most votes. The only alternative is for Germany to accept parity with France in return for a favourable share out of seats in the European parliament. The toughest item on the agenda. Commission size Difficult talks are also expected over the size of the 20-strong European Commission, the \"supranational\" executive of the EU, which initiates legislation and applies community rules. The four big boys, plus Spain, have two commissioners each (Neil Kinnock and Chris Patten are Britain's); the others one each.

I just hope people will accept me for the person I am.\"</p> <p>The crown prince had already become the first European royal to live with a partner without first marrying. He moved into an Oslo flat with Ms Tjessem Hoiby, 27, last September, prompting a barrage of criticism from conservatives and churchmen.</p> <p>Haakon admitted he had thought of giving up his claim to the throne as a result of the sniping. \"It would have been strange if the thought hadn't entered my mind,\" he said. \"But I've never seriously considered it. We believe in the monarchy.\"</p> <p>The prince's critics, mainly strict Protestants, say he should set a moral example to his 4.5m subjects, but opinion polls showed that most Norwegians are unflustered at the prospect of a future queen who has admitted hanging out at ecstasy- and cocaine-fuelled house parties in the 1990s.</p> <p>Ms Tjessem Hoiby has since refused to talk further about her partying past, and a CV issued by the royal palace noted only anodyne details such as the would-be queen's past job as a strawberry picker and her year at a high school in Wangaratta, Australia.</p> <p>The bright and articulate prince, who has often declared that nothing in his girlfriend's background would stand in the way of marriage, is a hugely popular representative of a royal family that is markedly less stuffy than many others - and is allowed a lot more privacy.</p> <p>Haakon's father, King Harald, has supported his son's choice, perhaps because he himself had to battle for almost a decade to persuade his father, King Olav, to allow him to marry a commoner, his childhood sweetheart Sonja Haraldsen, who is now Queen.</p> <p>But many Norwegians fear Ms Tjessem Hoiby's son, Marius, three, has drawn the short straw. The constitution allows only children born within royal wedlock to accede to the throne, and the boy is likely to grow up in the shadow of the monarchy, with princes and princesses fas half-sisters and -brothers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Queen Victoria's great-great-great grandson, Crown Prince Haakon of Norway, yesterday announced his engagement to his live-in girlfriend - a single mother whose former lover had multiple convictions for violence, drink-driving and possession of cocaine. Prince Haakon, a trainee diplomat at the Norwegian foreign ministry, said he had proposed to Mette-Marit Tjessem Hoiby, a student known as \"the Cinderella from Kristiansand\", yesterday morning, that she had accepted his diamond ring - the one used by his father and grandfather - and that the wedding was planned for August 25 next year. \"It was not an easy choice,\" Ms Tjessem Hoiby said of her decision to become Norway's best-known young wife. \"But I look forward to marrying Haakon and I look forward to entering that role. I just hope people will accept me for the person I am.\" The crown prince had already become the first European royal to live with a partner without first marrying. He moved into an Oslo flat with Ms Tjessem Hoiby, 27, last September, prompting a barrage of criticism from conservatives and churchmen. Haakon admitted he had thought of giving up his claim to the throne as a result of the sniping. \"It would have been strange if the thought hadn't entered my mind,\" he said. \"But I've never seriously considered it. We believe in the monarchy.\" The prince's critics, mainly strict Protestants, say he should set a moral example to his 4.5m subjects, but opinion polls showed that most Norwegians are unflustered at the prospect of a future queen who has admitted hanging out at ecstasy- and cocaine-fuelled house parties in the 1990s. Ms Tjessem Hoiby has since refused to talk further about her partying past, and a CV issued by the royal palace noted only anodyne details such as the would-be queen's past job as a strawberry picker and her year at a high school in Wangaratta, Australia. The bright and articulate prince, who has often declared that nothing in his girlfriend's background would stand in the way of marriage, is a hugely popular representative of a royal family that is markedly less stuffy than many others - and is allowed a lot more privacy. Haakon's father, King Harald, has supported his son's choice, perhaps because he himself had to battle for almost a decade to persuade his father, King Olav, to allow him to marry a commoner, his childhood sweetheart Sonja Haraldsen, who is now Queen. But many Norwegians fear Ms Tjessem Hoiby's son, Marius, three, has drawn the short straw. The constitution allows only children born within royal wedlock to accede to the throne, and the boy is likely to grow up in the shadow of the monarchy, with princes and princesses fas half-sisters and -brothers.",

      "body": "<p>As dusk seeps over Milan, Sergio Cusani checks his watch and paces to the window. Illuminated towers of concrete, steel and glass dissolve into blackness as workers stream from offices into bars, restaurants and theatres.</p> <p>Cusani is in his fifth-floor apartment, surrounded by paintings, mahogany furniture and books. The cat is teasing the puppy, dinner is being prepared, and the ex-financier is not planning to go anywhere. By night he is a prisoner, the last captive of Tangentopoli.</p> <p>To be outside his door between 9pm and 7am is to book a ticket back to his cell in San Vittore prison, his home for five and a half years. The curfew will end in March, when his debt to society will officially have been paid.</p> <p>For nine months he has been allowed out only by day. He tends to avoid the banks, party offices and city hall, but people recognise him just the same.</p> <p>Cusani was the public face of a corruption scandal that swept away Italy's ruling class in the early 90s. His televised trial attracted huge audiences. Systematic bribes and kickbacks were revealed to a fascinated, horrified electorate.</p> <p>Most shocking of all was that it happened not in the sunbaked, mafia-ridden south but in the acme of northern thrift and innovation: Milan. The capital of Lombardy was renamed Tangentopoli, or Bribesville. But in reality the entire country was infected.</p> <p>Cusani's sentencing marked a watershed. An establishment entrenched for half a century collapsed. Ministers were arrested, premiers fled, bankers committed suicide. Jails filled up as prosecutors swooped. It was an earthquake. The radical changes which followed amounted to a second Italian republic built on the rubble of the first.</p> <p>Turning his back on the rush-hour traffic, Cusani, 52, returns to his couch, overlooked by a painting of the Death of Adonis. \"Yes, I admit my share of responsibility. There was a bacterium. It was not a good time. But I am out now, I am rebuilding a life.\" He fell in love with his lawyer, married her and they have a young son.</p> <p>Voluntary work, including setting up a non-profit-making bank, takes up much of his time. Money is not a problem as he comes from a wealthy family.</p> <p>Another project is penal reform. Cusani has urged the government to relieve overcrowding and despair in jails by granting an amnesty, as the Vatican has suggested.</p> <p>Does he believe in the second republic? He stares. \"The second republic does not exist. We are all tired of this phenomenon. It represented only a hope of change.\"</p> <p>These days even the hope is ebbing. Italy's brave new world has not turned out as expected. Everything has changed but only, say some, so that things could remain the same.</p> <p>Next month the prime minister, Giuliano Amato, and the head of the European commission, Romano Prodi, will be called to the witness stand to testify in a bribery case against the opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi.</p> <p>It is probably the last gasp of the at tack on Tangentopoli, because this case, like all the others against Mr Berlusconi, will almost certainly fail. He is surging ahead in the polls and is expected to romp back to power in elections next spring.</p> <p>He is sweeping along on a tide of revisionism. A parliamentary commission is re-evaluating Tangentopoli. Once-reviled public figures are being rehabilitated on chat shows.</p> <p>Corruption is creeping back, but now it is history on trial. Italians are being invited to take a closer look at the prosecutors. Were they really heroes, or were they leftwing hatchet men? The time is coming when it will be their turn to be chopped down, says Mr Berlusconi.</p> <p>What started in March 1992 as an investigation into a cleaning contractor's bribe to a Socialist party official, Mario Chiesa, snowballed into an expos\u00e9 of a nation-wide system of illegal party funding so brazen Machiavelli would have blushed.</p> <p>Codenamed mani pulite (clean hands), it implicated the dominant Christian Democratic-Socialist axis. Businesses seeking public contracts covertly funded election and management costs. Around $1.5bn changed hands.</p> <p>The financier Raul Gardini shot himself.

      "bodyText": "As dusk seeps over Milan, Sergio Cusani checks his watch and paces to the window. Illuminated towers of concrete, steel and glass dissolve into blackness as workers stream from offices into bars, restaurants and theatres. Cusani is in his fifth-floor apartment, surrounded by paintings, mahogany furniture and books. The cat is teasing the puppy, dinner is being prepared, and the ex-financier is not planning to go anywhere. By night he is a prisoner, the last captive of Tangentopoli. To be outside his door between 9pm and 7am is to book a ticket back to his cell in San Vittore prison, his home for five and a half years. The curfew will end in March, when his debt to society will officially have been paid. For nine months he has been allowed out only by day. He tends to avoid the banks, party offices and city hall, but people recognise him just the same. Cusani was the public face of a corruption scandal that swept away Italy's ruling class in the early 90s. His televised trial attracted huge audiences. Systematic bribes and kickbacks were revealed to a fascinated, horrified electorate. Most shocking of all was that it happened not in the sunbaked, mafia-ridden south but in the acme of northern thrift and innovation: Milan. The capital of Lombardy was renamed Tangentopoli, or Bribesville. But in reality the entire country was infected. Cusani's sentencing marked a watershed. An establishment entrenched for half a century collapsed. Ministers were arrested, premiers fled, bankers committed suicide. Jails filled up as prosecutors swooped. It was an earthquake. The radical changes which followed amounted to a second Italian republic built on the rubble of the first. Turning his back on the rush-hour traffic, Cusani, 52, returns to his couch, overlooked by a painting of the Death of Adonis. \"Yes, I admit my share of responsibility. There was a bacterium. It was not a good time. But I am out now, I am rebuilding a life.\" He fell in love with his lawyer, married her and they have a young son. Voluntary work, including setting up a non-profit-making bank, takes up much of his time. Money is not a problem as he comes from a wealthy family. Another project is penal reform. Cusani has urged the government to relieve overcrowding and despair in jails by granting an amnesty, as the Vatican has suggested. Does he believe in the second republic? He stares. \"The second republic does not exist. We are all tired of this phenomenon. It represented only a hope of change.\" These days even the hope is ebbing. Italy's brave new world has not turned out as expected. Everything has changed but only, say some, so that things could remain the same. Next month the prime minister, Giuliano Amato, and the head of the European commission, Romano Prodi, will be called to the witness stand to testify in a bribery case against the opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi. It is probably the last gasp of the at tack on Tangentopoli, because this case, like all the others against Mr Berlusconi, will almost certainly fail. He is surging ahead in the polls and is expected to romp back to power in elections next spring. He is sweeping along on a tide of revisionism. A parliamentary commission is re-evaluating Tangentopoli. Once-reviled public figures are being rehabilitated on chat shows. Corruption is creeping back, but now it is history on trial. Italians are being invited to take a closer look at the prosecutors. Were they really heroes, or were they leftwing hatchet men? The time is coming when it will be their turn to be chopped down, says Mr Berlusconi. What started in March 1992 as an investigation into a cleaning contractor's bribe to a Socialist party official, Mario Chiesa, snowballed into an expos\u00e9 of a nation-wide system of illegal party funding so brazen Machiavelli would have blushed. Codenamed mani pulite (clean hands), it implicated the dominant Christian Democratic-Socialist axis. Businesses seeking public contracts covertly funded election and management costs. Around $1.5bn changed hands. The financier Raul Gardini shot himself. Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister, was charged with mafia collaboration and denied his dream of becoming president. Bettino Craxi, another ex-prime minister, was surrounded by a mob and pelted with coins. He was sentenced to nine and a half years and fled to Tunisia, where he died last January, aged 65. Today the Socialists and Christian Democrats are destroyed. The systemic corruption they pioneered is gone. The relatively untainted centre-left is in power. Yet as the smoke of battle has lifted, Tangentopoli has been shown to be no triumph. Cusani is the last of only a few prisoners. Prosecutors requested 3,165 trials. Judges granted around a third, resulting in 582 convictions. But appeals, deals and the expiry of the statute of limitations whittled the number in jail down to less than 10. Gerardo D'Ambrosio, Milan's chief prosecutor, told Corriere della Sera that Tangentopoli never finished. \"All the signs are of an increase in corruption. Experience has created antibodies: today the corrupt know how to cover their tracks. Inquiries are ever more difficult, while reforms continue to lengthen the time of trials. Now, for certain crimes, one can think of having enough power for impunity.\" In September Massimo Guarischi, the chairman of Lombardy's regional assembly budget committee, and eight businessmen were charged with rigging public contracts. Mr Guarischi was with Craxi's Socialists before starting a television career with Mr Berlusconi's Milan-based media empire. According to the commentator Angelo Panebianco, politicians are reflecting a society-wide negation of the common good. The latest corruption perceptions index, published by the anti-graft group Transparency International, ranked Italy 39th out of the 60 countries surveyed - firmly in the zone of developing countries. \"Companies still pay bribes but it might be in a less direct way. There is a lot of political lobbying, a lot of grey areas,\" said Fabio Poletti, a journalist with La Stampa. \"But in the media there is a sense of boredom, that it's the same story and we've heard it all before.

In reality, the problem is his lack of charisma. After almost nine years of crime and punishment, redemption is in. Claudio Martelli, a disgraced former justice minister, was elected to the European parliament and cheered when he triumphed in a television spoof of the Survivor show. Mr Andreotti has been cleared in two trials and is now a chat show regular with a dry wit. Stefania and Bobo Craxi are gathering support to name a giant fountain in front of Milan's Castello Sforzesco after their father. In the town of Aulla, a 3.8-metre obelisk, with wings symbolising freedom, has been raised to \"commemorate those imprisoned, impoverished, scorned, insulted\" by the Tangentopoli affair. A parliamentary commission to investigate party funding came close to becoming an inquiry into prosecutors' methods, and may yet do so. Leading the charge is Mr Berlusconi. The 64-year-old billionaire wants payback. In 1994 he was prime minister, presiding over a law enforcement summit, when he was charged with bribery. His government collapsed and he has spent six years fighting - and gradually winning - myriad court battles, often on technicalities. Only minor charges are outstanding.

Polls suggest Mr Berlusconi will hammer the government. Hence the sudden sympathy of supposedly independent judges, said commentator Giorgio Bocca, \"as always happens in the Belpaese when the winds change\".",

It's great and I would really like to take advantage of this,\" she says. <p>But even though her cost of living is now lower, the 27-year-old local government arts officer has a problem: she has no savings. </p> <p>\"So, help! I need to save fast and I need some independent financial advice, and although I have a good relationship with my bank, I suspect they may not be the best people to give it. I do not want to be forced to take out an 100% mortgage, although I think my bank would give me one.\" She banks with HSBC. </p> <p>\"I have just paid off a \u00a36,000 graduate loan and although I earn \u00a323,000, I have no money saved.

She is also happy to tie up some of that money for five years: \"In fact, in my case I think it's best tied up. </p> <p>\"Oh, and my car is in a state of terminal decline and I need to get a newer one,\" she adds. </p> <p><b>The solution</b><br><b>Paul Fuller</b><br><br>Celia is in a quandary: she has so much she wants to do but so little with which to do it.

Celia appears to have a \"medium\" attitude to risk (she does not just want to sit on her money, nor is she willing to invest in,say, an emerging market fund, which could rocket but which could also bomb) and so I would suggest a good, actively managed fund such as Exeter Managed Growth, which is currently the top performing fund in its sector over five and 10 years. </p> <p>This type of fund should provide good growth over the medium term (five years) but could also provide access to capital in the event of an emergency. </p> <p>\u0095 Paul Fuller is a director of Baronworth Investment Services. </p> <p>\u0095 If you are 18-30, working and want advice on managing your money, email <a href=\"mailto:jobs.and.money@theguardian.com\">jobs.and.money@theguardian.com</a></p>",

I agree that it would be better not to take an 100% mortgage: if you can save just 5% of the asking price you will have access to a far better range of mortgage rate deals. This type of investment allows your money to grow in a completely tax-free environment - it will not be subject to income or capital gains tax. Celia appears to have a \"medium\" attitude to risk (she does not just want to sit on her money, nor is she willing to invest in,say, an emerging market fund, which could rocket but which could also bomb) and so I would suggest a good, actively managed fund such as Exeter Managed Growth, which is currently the top performing fund in its sector over five and 10 years. This type of fund should provide good growth over the medium term (five years) but could also provide access to capital in the event of an emergency. \u0095 Paul Fuller is a director of Baronworth Investment Services. \u0095 If you are 18-30, working and want advice on managing your money, email jobs.and.money@theguardian.com",

This year's figure of 81,000 tonnes was already a historic low.</p> <p>North Sea cod stocks have dwindled to their lowest levels since records began in 1963 and the commission argued that it had no choice but to go for what one official described as \"the nuclear option\".</p> <p>There are an estimated 70,000 tonnes of adult cod in the North Sea - the larder on which fish and chip shops depend - compared with 250,000 tonnes in the 1960s.

      "bodyText": "The European commission proposed its biggest cuts in North Sea cod quotas last night and warned that stocks were on the verge of extinction. In a move which the British fishing industry fears will cost hundreds of jobs, Brussels called for next year's quota to be slashed by 40% to 48,600 tonnes. This year's figure of 81,000 tonnes was already a historic low. North Sea cod stocks have dwindled to their lowest levels since records began in 1963 and the commission argued that it had no choice but to go for what one official described as \"the nuclear option\". There are an estimated 70,000 tonnes of adult cod in the North Sea - the larder on which fish and chip shops depend - compared with 250,000 tonnes in the 1960s. The minimum stock level to guarantee the species' survival is 150,000 tonnes. The commission also demanded a reduction of 56% for cod catches west of Scotland. The proposals will be passed to EU fisheries ministers who meet in Brussels this month. Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said the negotiations were likely to be fraught. \"There will be blood on the carpet,\" he said. \"These proposals will displace several hundred fishermen from the industry.\" The government yesterday refused to comment on the quota, but the fisheries minister, Elliot Morley, signalled that drastic action was needed. \"The UK fleet has only been able to catch around 60% of its quota this year - simply because the boats have been unable to find the fish.\" The commission said its proposals were inevitable.

      "body": "<p>The new chief inspector of schools in England took charge yesterday and immediately offered teachers the prospect of a much smoother ride than they got from his predecessor.</p> <p>Mike Tomlinson, 58, adopted a notably more emollient tone than the former head of the office for standards in education, Chris Woodhead, who in his first week demanded that incompetent teachers be sacked.</p> <p>At a press conference at his headquarters at the Aldwych, central London, Mr Tomlinson, until yesterday head of inspection at Ofsted, went out of his way to praise the \"hard work and dedication\" of teachers which had cut the number of lessons identified as unsatisfactory from 30% to 6% over the past decade.</p> <p>He emphasised Ofsted's role in encouraging the spread of good ideas adopted by individual schools on a range of issues, including bullying, ethnic minority education and lesson-planning time for teachers.</p> <p>\"I'm not Chris Woodhead, I'm my own person and I shall handle matters in my own way,\" Mr Tomlinson said.</p> <p>\"I share his absolute passion for wanting the highest possible standards within our schools and wanting every child to receive the best possible education that they need and deserve in order to give them the best start in life.</p> <p>\"I shall pursue that passion with the same vigour. I shall want to be stating quite categorically where things are not as they should be. But I will equally want to give the same force to those areas of work which are improving, and where teachers and all those associated with schools are bringing about the necessary improvements.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I have grandchildren in the system and I want the very best education for them. Therefore it's important to me personally as well as professionally.\" He said two members of his family taught in state schools.</p> <p>In the wake of the murder of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor in Peckham, south-east London, Mr Tomlinson said he wanted Ofsted to play a part in helping schools stamp out bullying.</p> <p>He wanted to encourage schools and local education authorities to collect data on ethnic minority pupil performance, and he recognised \"the importance and contributions that different cultures can bring to the teaching situation\". The commission for racial equality accused Mr Woodhead of ignoring race issues.</p> <p>Like the government, Mr Tomlinson would focus on the dip in performance in the early years of secondary school, at key stage three.</p> <p>Other areas of concern include weaknesses in writing skills, the underperformance of boys, bureaucracy and the recruitment and retention of teachers.

      "bodyText": "The new chief inspector of schools in England took charge yesterday and immediately offered teachers the prospect of a much smoother ride than they got from his predecessor. Mike Tomlinson, 58, adopted a notably more emollient tone than the former head of the office for standards in education, Chris Woodhead, who in his first week demanded that incompetent teachers be sacked. At a press conference at his headquarters at the Aldwych, central London, Mr Tomlinson, until yesterday head of inspection at Ofsted, went out of his way to praise the \"hard work and dedication\" of teachers which had cut the number of lessons identified as unsatisfactory from 30% to 6% over the past decade. He emphasised Ofsted's role in encouraging the spread of good ideas adopted by individual schools on a range of issues, including bullying, ethnic minority education and lesson-planning time for teachers. \"I'm not Chris Woodhead, I'm my own person and I shall handle matters in my own way,\" Mr Tomlinson said. \"I share his absolute passion for wanting the highest possible standards within our schools and wanting every child to receive the best possible education that they need and deserve in order to give them the best start in life. \"I shall pursue that passion with the same vigour. I shall want to be stating quite categorically where things are not as they should be. But I will equally want to give the same force to those areas of work which are improving, and where teachers and all those associated with schools are bringing about the necessary improvements.\" He added: \"I have grandchildren in the system and I want the very best education for them. Therefore it's important to me personally as well as professionally.\" He said two members of his family taught in state schools. In the wake of the murder of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor in Peckham, south-east London, Mr Tomlinson said he wanted Ofsted to play a part in helping schools stamp out bullying. He wanted to encourage schools and local education authorities to collect data on ethnic minority pupil performance, and he recognised \"the importance and contributions that different cultures can bring to the teaching situation\". The commission for racial equality accused Mr Woodhead of ignoring race issues. Like the government, Mr Tomlinson would focus on the dip in performance in the early years of secondary school, at key stage three. Other areas of concern include weaknesses in writing skills, the underperformance of boys, bureaucracy and the recruitment and retention of teachers. He intended to work \"effectively and constructively with all our partners in education where they share a concern to improve standards all round\". Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, urged the new chief inspector to order a review of the inspection system. \"Mike Tomlinson starts off in an enviable position. He can repair the damage created by his predecessor. I wish him well in that task. I look forward to working with Mr Tomlinson to ensure that school inspection becomes a process which is recognised as valuable, not feared.\" In contrast to Mr Woodhead, who recently criticised \"vacuous\" degree subjects, Mr Tomlinson said higher education, other than teacher training, was not part of his remit. And he apologised again - twice - for his remark a few years ago that he didn't \"give a monkey's toss for teachers\". Ofsted officials are anxious for the media to stop quoting that remark. Mr Tomlinson, a chemistry graduate from Durham university, was a teacher in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire from 1965 to 1977. He joined the Inspectorate of Schools in 1978 and became director of inspection at Ofsted in 1995. David Blunkett, the education secretary, offered him the chief inspector's job after Mr Woodhead resigned to join the Daily Telegraph. \"You'll all appreciate that recent events resulting in me becoming the chief inspector have been both rapid and rather surprising,\" Mr Tomlinson said. \"I'm only slowly coming to terms with the change.

Arthur Chandler, curator of The Man Who Drew Pooh, an exhibition of the life of EH Shepard, London, dived into 70 years of the artist's diaries wondering if he would find scandal - especially since Shepard's will said no biography was to be written until 30 years after his death. After five years work in the Shepard archive at Surrey University, Mr Chandler, author of a new book on the artist, has concluded that the truth is indeed startling - he was a truly happy man, who loved his children, his life and his work.

The date could be significant for the government if it calls an election, but Railtrack's new chief executive, Steve Marshall, said that he would be \"more comfortable\" in dealing with the question on a return to normality in a few weeks. Over the next fortnight, Railtrack will start lifting 340 of the 572 speed restrictions currently in use, of which 200 are on sites where the speed limit will be raised from 20 mph to 40mph, and 140 are in places where the limit is to be increased from 40 to 60 mph. A big push has been started to get the railway in some sort of shape before Christmas, but there will be inevitable closures over the holiday period as Railtrack engineers work on maintenance work already scheduled. Railtrack now faces the threat that Labour will seek to take greater control of the railway in its election manifesto if the company fails to deliver the improvements which ministers are seeking. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, has told Railtrack that the network must be returned to its state pre-Hatfield or he will impose further controls over the company.

The speed restrictions were appropriate and necesssary following the accident at Hatfield, but the huge effort by our engineers to check the tracks for gauge corner cracking means that we are now in a position where we can safely raise the limits at some sites.\" Richard Middleton, Railtrack, technical director, said that the company had not over-reacted after Hatfield, and that a nationwide check had to be put in place. He described it as a sensible engineering response. Since Hatfield, Railtrack has checked more than 3,000 sites which have shown evidence of gauge corner cracking. As re-railing takes place, the length of the track affected by the problem is falling, even though five new potential danger sites are discovered each day. Mr Middleton said that in some cases steel plate is being placed on the track to support it until a permanent job is completed. So far 117 miles of track has been relayed and 70 per cent of the network checked. Another 300 miles of new track still has to be laid at the rate of 20 miles a week.",

      "bodyText": "A former soldier who served 17 years in prison for a double murder was freed on bail yesterday after doubts emerged about his conviction. Peter Fell, 39, who came from a deprived family background, was known to police as a fantasist and had even confessed to being the Yorkshire Ripper, his solicitor said. He was released pending a full appeal hearing in January, but prosecution lawyers yesterday conceded that his confession had been unreliable. Fell was convicted of the murders of Ann Lee, 44, and Margaret \"Peggy\" Johnson, 65, who were exercising their dogs on Aldershot common in May 1982 when they were stabbed several times. There was no forensic evidence nor any apparent motive. Fell made a series of anonymous telephone calls to police, the day after the murders, giving the name and address of the killer as Peter Fell of York Road, Aldershot. Thirteen months later he rang again, giving his new address in Bournemouth, where he worked as a hospital porter and had married. At Fell's trial in 1984, the jury was told that he had admitted attacking the women, but did not remember stabbing them. His solicitor, James Nichol, said the partial confession was made after he had been held in solitary confinement for 72 hours, denied access to a solicitor, and refused food. Fell later claimed that he was not on the common at the time of the murder. He said yesterday: \"I am very relieved and naturally happy and I have always believed that one day I would be proved innocent.\" Prison had been an ordeal, but he had became a Christian and his faith had helped him. Asked why he had confessed to the murders, he said: \"I used to say a lot of silly things, but did not realise that they would be used against me at the trial.\" His solicitor said: \"He has been in prison for 17 years too long. He is innocent and will be shown to be innocent, because he could not have been at the crime scene at the time of the killings.\" Patrick O'Connor QC, representing Fell at the bail hearing, said new evidence would show that Fell was \"unusually vulnerable\" to suggestion and that his psychological condition was not understood at the time. Fell was \"a serial confessor\" and prone to fantasy, who would admit to things he had not done. While on bail, Fell, who was at the category C prison The Verne in Portland, Dorset, will stay with a prison visitor who has taken an interest in his case.",

Dublin</strong> </p> <p>It's swaggering with Euro enterprise, with barely fewer cranes on the skyline than in Berlin, and a feeling that this is no longer a dependency: they've shaken off the British. We film by the canal where Beckett paced and looked up at the window of the nursing home where his mother was dying. Our driver tells me he's a cousin of a cousin of Beckett. Their mutual cousin had a wooden leg, which she used to take off for swimming, he says. He adds that Beckett was once so hard up and desperate for a cigarette in Paris in the middle of the night that he went out and sold the sheets off his bed. </p> <p>Off to the Wicklow hills, where Beckett walked with his father - a continent of heather and peat and little mountain peaks in the background, wild and desolate. Standing here in the biting wind facing a camera talking about the theatre of Brecht and Beckett seems more than usually absurd. And no less so, the mournful walk on the long pier at Dun Laoghaire past a public lavatory that appears to be a popular cottaging spot. The pier features in Krapp's Last Tape; the lavatory doesn't. </p> <p><strong> December 8</strong> </p> <p>Interviews with Alan Ayckbourn and Harold Pinter. Alan has written more plays than Shakespeare, and a few years ago, a poll revealed that his plays were joint second in the world to Shakespeare in popularity (along with Brecht). Like Shakespeare, Alan has a company (in Scarborough) and has to provide a play for them every year. He speaks admiringly of Beckett, but confesses that he once fell asleep onstage during Lucky's speech, while playing one of the tramps. He describes Shakespeare as a big, sandy beach - every new generation comes down and scrawls furiously on it with a piece of stick, and then the tide comes in and the whole thing is as it was. </p> <p>Harold talks openly, vividly and amusingly for about an hour and a half: about his own work, about Coward, Wilde, and Brecht (who he admires greatly), and Beckett, who, he said, loved gossip: \"What's the latest?,\" he'd say to Harold - the immeasurable tenderness of the man set against the despair. And we talk about politics. Our generation, ostentatiously cocky in the 1970s, used to think that Harold came late to politics, but he points out that he was a conscientious objector against national service in 1948, and was prepared to go to prison - taking his toothbrush along to the trial - which is a rather more thorough act of political engagement than I or any of my contemporaries made. He recommends me a poem of his - \"it's pretty good, actually\" - called Requiem for 1945, about the death of post-war hope. </p> <p>Like Alan, Harold was (and still is) an actor, and talks about the tension between actor and audience that \"has to be addressed: you can't let them win.\" </p> <p>He deplores the way that the audience nowadays is part of the action, and the actors part of the audience: \"I remember once when I went to see a production of Nicholas Nickleby at the Aldwych, and an actor I had actually directed was prancing around before the show, pretending to sell hot coconuts or something, and he came up to me, and waved a hot coconut in my face, and I said, 'Bugger off.' And he went away and then just as the curtain rose - the whole thing was about to start - he danced down the aisle and thrust a hot coconut in my lap...\" </p> <p><strong> December 16</strong> </p> <p>I interview Steven Berkoff, and feel it's a shame that he can't appear in three dimensions. As if to argue his case for the body as his instrument, he uses his hands with sculptural expressiveness. He has a reputation (not entirely earned) for being a theatrical Rottweiler, but he's genial, eloquent, even witty, about the theatre he admires and has tried to create. After we've finished, the studio technicians talk about theatre. \"It's dead, isn't it?\" says one genially. I slink away, not for the first time wondering who this series will be addressing. </p> <p><strong> December 21</strong> </p> <p>I interview Alan Bennett in my kitchen. I should have used Alan's adage on the studio technician: \"I don't think people should be made to go to the theatre if they don't want to. It makes it such hard work for the actors.\" There's no playwright in the country who's better known or better liked by the public; he's one of the - quintessentially English - family, a familiar face, a national institution, adjectival: \"Very Alan Bennett,\" people say. </p> <p>Alan isn't at his happiest when talking about his own work: he reveals a \"self\" in his plays and diaries but when he's sitting in my kitchen facing an interrogation, the \"self\" is undeniably himself. But he rallies generously, and answers my questions with a practised ease, aware, from his countless TV appearances, of the virtues of pithiness and brevity. </p> <p>Of The Importance of Being Earnest, he says: \"Most plays are nearly completed circles and the production completes the circle; The Importance of Being Earnest is completed there on the page. It was a perfect play and I think Wilde knew it.\" </p> <p><strong> January 5 2000. New York</strong> </p> <p>I interview Liam Neeson about Irish theatre. Liam is a veteran of 1,000 promotional interviews for films, so it's a comparative novelty for him to do an interview where he doesn't know the questions and has to consider the answers. He speaks feelingly and fluently of Irish theatre and being a voluntary exile and wishing he'd been in Dublin for the first performances of O'Casey's plays, and of Wilde's folie d'amour and his elocution lessons and his out-Englishing the English. </p> <p>\"I remember when I decided to come over and live in England I was very, very, very conscious of being Irish. I was aware especially when the Queen's cavalry were blown up in Hyde Park. If I was in a shop or something like that I'd put on this faux English accent.\" </p> <p>Then to the Village - to Wooster Street - to interview actor Willem Dafoe about his involvement with the Wooster Group. Acting in movies underwrites his work with this avant-garde group, and he lives the enviable life of man unencumbered by ambition, liberated from the market, pursuing his passion. He's very charming and engaging about working with the group, creating theatre-like collages. I ask him what the special properties of theatre are. \"Well,\" he says, \"where else can you get spat on by an actor?\" </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Eyre's TV series Changing Stages continues on BBC2 tomorrow at 7.05pm</p>",

Why are newspapers, which are constantly calling for accountability in others, generally so reluctant to be accountable themselves?

You may take it as read that they all do. </p> <p>The editor of the Guardian, writing a diary in this week's New Statesman, notes the advent of a readers' editor, modelled on the Guardian system, at Politiken, the Danish newspaper, then adds, \"But so far, one has to confess, the idea has not spread like a bushfire through the British press. </p> <p>\"Do other editors really believe their readers will trust them less if they keep admitting they got things wrong? Can't they see that the reverse is true...\" </p> <p>It certainly is true to say that an increasing number of journalists on other papers are making it clear that they would welcome a franker relationship of this kind with their readers. The Express, for example (although things have changed there somewhat in the past few days), in mentioning the book, said that, \"Since its introduction as 'a forum for accountability' in 1997, [the Guardian's corrections system] has been an unqualified success.\" A senior journalist on the Express, in a radio discussion a week ago, said, \"... it is utterly proper that if you get something wrong, you should correct it at the first possible opportunity and not try and squabble\". </p> <p>In the same programme (Radio 5 Live's Paper Talk, presented by Brian Hayes on November 24), a senior journalist from the Telegraph said - and we must take it that he was speaking generally and not with specific reference to his own paper - \"I think one of the most disgraceful things about our business is our refusal actually to admit when we get things wrong. And as newspaper journalists we're brought up - and it certainly happened to me - to do everything we can to avoid apologising or issuing a correction... </p> <p>\"We spend hours trying to persuade people who have every reason to expect a correction, will they accept a letter from us saying 'I'm sorry we got this wrong'? And when they say 'Well, no, we want a correction in the paper', [we say] 'Well would you write a letter to the paper?' </p> <p>\"I don't know why we do it, because the Guardian, I think, is doing brilliantly with this system.\" </p> <p>Clive Soley, the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour party and joint author of Regulating The Press (published this month by Pluto), lamented in a recent article in the Times, \"The press is very reluctant either to say sorry - most don't even have a correction column - or to admit that they got it wrong.\" </p> <p> A senior journalist on the Times, reviewing the Guardian's Corrections book, shares some of our best or worst moments with his readers but points out, \"The truth is that similar cock-ups appear in most newspapers most days... If a newspaper is prepared to admit to error... it establishes a relationship of trust with readers for being honest enough to admit mistakes.\" </p> <p>When I talked to postgraduate journalism students at the City University in London this week, I fancied I detected a flicker of surprise and dismay when I said that society at large did not hold the journalist in high esteem. A more open and mature relationship is in everyone's interest, and maybe the students from the City, and others just entering the profession, will do something to foster it. </p> <p>A willingness to correct things when you know they are wrong does not seem too much to ask. Why, perhaps we shall soon be asking, did it take us all so long to get round to it? </p> <p>\u0095 The Guardian book of Corrections &amp; Clarifications, which includes more than 50 of these Open Door columns, with a large selection of our funnier corrections, is published by Guardian Newspapers Limited at \u00a36.99.

And as newspaper journalists we're brought up - and it certainly happened to me - to do everything we can to avoid apologising or issuing a correction... \"We spend hours trying to persuade people who have every reason to expect a correction, will they accept a letter from us saying 'I'm sorry we got this wrong'? And when they say 'Well, no, we want a correction in the paper', [we say] 'Well would you write a letter to the paper?' \"I don't know why we do it, because the Guardian, I think, is doing brilliantly with this system.\" Clive Soley, the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour party and joint author of Regulating The Press (published this month by Pluto), lamented in a recent article in the Times, \"The press is very reluctant either to say sorry - most don't even have a correction column - or to admit that they got it wrong.\" A senior journalist on the Times, reviewing the Guardian's Corrections book, shares some of our best or worst moments with his readers but points out, \"The truth is that similar cock-ups appear in most newspapers most days... If a newspaper is prepared to admit to error... it establishes a relationship of trust with readers for being honest enough to admit mistakes.\" When I talked to postgraduate journalism students at the City University in London this week, I fancied I detected a flicker of surprise and dismay when I said that society at large did not hold the journalist in high esteem. A more open and mature relationship is in everyone's interest, and maybe the students from the City, and others just entering the profession, will do something to foster it. A willingness to correct things when you know they are wrong does not seem too much to ask. Why, perhaps we shall soon be asking, did it take us all so long to get round to it? \u0095 The Guardian book of Corrections &amp; Clarifications, which includes more than 50 of these Open Door columns, with a large selection of our funnier corrections, is published by Guardian Newspapers Limited at \u00a36.99.

His people are heroic lumps, dwarfed by cosmic explosions of light and weather that they either contemplate in static wonder or try desperately to survive. In his work Caernarvon Castle, under a golden sky and in a lattice of shadows, a Celtic bard sings to a pious conclave sitting under an oak tree. And did those feet in ancient time_ now, who does that remind you of? </p> <p>Turner: the Great Watercolours, a beautiful display in the Royal Academy's Sackler Galleries, has been put on by the RA for no better reason than the 250th anniversary of Turner's death. Chance, however, has given it a more interesting context: it coincides with the Blake show at Tate Britain. Blake (1757-1827) and Turner (1775-1851) both paint people not realistically or according to academic drawing rules, but as robed ancients, muscular vessels of spiritual revelation. And they are both political artists. </p> <p>Sometimes we talk about the world's favourite British artist as if he were an honest chronicler of nature, like Constable; he's anything but. Like Blake, he paints the world transfigured. His light is not just a depiction of nature, but nature with the volume cranked up very loud. The objections to his work by Victorian critics should remind us that no one ever looked at Folkestone From the Sea, a glory of this exhibition, and said, \"Ah yes - that's what Folkestone looks like.\" Folkestone? It's a city on the shores of a lake in hell. The sky burns pink, the moon is a white lantern blazing through lowering clouds, the sea is evil, as a gang of smugglers realise they're about to be caught. This is a million miles from homely British self-images. </p> <p>Caernarvon Castle is a clue to Turner's politics. As the son of a Covent Garden barber who was elected to the Royal Academy, Turner seems to have known when to keep his mouth shut, so his ideas are a mystery. But he grew up in a dramatic era and his paintings participate in it. Turner always tried to record his times, rushing to paint the battle-scarred HMS Victory after Trafalgar. Later he painted the Houses of Parliament in flames. Turner's champion John Ruskin simply didn't see the moral anger in his work, praising Turner's masterpiece Slaver Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying - Typhon Coming On as a perfect depiction of the sea in a storm, without mentioning its subject matter, except in a footnote, or that Turner intended it as his contribution to the campaign against the slave trade. </p> <p>Turner painted Caernarvon Castle when he was about 25. The French Revolution and subsequent wars convulsed Europe; at home, half-underground groups campaigned for political reform. Turner's inclusion of a Welsh bard is not accidental. The bards were romanticised in this period as icons of primitive freedom. This wasn't a nationalist image but a radical one. </p> <p>Of course it would be mad to deny Turner's patriotic love of the British landscape and coast, not to mention the British navy. His painting of a man o' war rising out of the sea, its bulk apparently as stable as a rock, in First-Rate Taking in Stores, is a tribute to the ships that sank Napoleon's ambitions. Yet when this watercolour was still drying at the home of patron Walter Fawkes, Turner painted a pendant showing a merchant ship shattered, going under for the last time in a boiling maelstrom of foam, people clinging to each other - some in soldier's uniforms. It records a real incident, the loss of an East Indiaman off Purbeck in 1786 in which 166 people died. </p> <p>History runs through Turner's art, however much Ruskin ignored it, and however much we want to see it through the filter of modernist abstraction. When he travelled to Europe he didn't just see mountains; he imagined them as settings for terrible battles, for Hannibal's hordes and Napoleon's Grande Arm\u00e9e. This exhibition includes two watercolours of the same alpine castle. One is a sweet scene of tourists contemplating the gorge below the battlements. The other imagines a fictional battle, with Napoleon's army in hand-to-hand combat with the fort's defenders. </p> <p>This exhibition reveals Turner's watercolours as romantic topographies with absolute precision of perspective - Turner was, after all, professor of perspective at the Royal Academy. A study such as Kilchern Castle is a consummate exercise in creating a real space on paper. Viewed from close to the ground, across a flat plain with mountains to the right, the earth recedes from us almost diagrammatically. Shadows fall on the fields; behind them is a streak of light, and behind that the tiny castle and distant peaks. The more of these landscapes you look at, the more a pattern emerges. </p> <p>Whether he is painting Conway Castle or the Rhine, Turner sees a hierarchy of receding phenomena: people in the foreground, a town behind them, a castle, mountains, sky, then finally the moon or sun. It amounts to a cosmology as hermetic as Blake's. Modern people - you and I - are in the foreground, with things becoming more ancient as they recede, until we see the origins of the earth, the universe, light. In Richmond Hill a group of picnickers sit and stand on England's green and pleasant land. They are sampling the picturesque. They get more than they bargained for. The sky that lights the woods and river in the distance is a divine gold, an apocalyptic window on heaven. Some of them look; some don't. It's as if Turner is urging them to look again, to see what he sees, to see the grandeur of existence, to respond, to get up. </p> <p>\u0095 Turner: the Great Watercolours is at the Royal Academy, London W1, until February 18.

The survey, as reported in the Financial Times, found only 8% of the working class supported the single currency, compared with 28% of the middle class. Another was the entry into the pre-summit argument of the governor of the bank of England, Eddie George, which provided a classic illustration of how the Euro-agenda of different papers can influence the way they report the same event. \"Euro will hurt on pay and tax says bank boss\" was the Mail's headline over a story that started: \"Britain faces a return to the stark 1970s policies of high taxes and pay restraint if we join the Euro, Sir Eddie George warned yesterday.\" The Financial Times said of the same speech: \"He said the use of fiscal policy instead of interest rates would involve recognition by people that their behaviour would have to be driven by the need to control inflation. Employees, for example, would be under pressure to moderate wage demands to avoid punishing tax rises.\" But after all the scare stories about the European rapid reaction force, the assault on British sovereignty, and the embarrassment of John Prescott's altercation in the Hague, came the public's response. A Mori poll in the Times put the Labour lead over the Tories two points up at 15%. Europe in the spotlight, and Labour's co-ordinated offensive provoking a strong sceptic response has not damaged Labour at all. Will that be the case after next week's summit?

Still the only sitarist trained solely by Ravi, she made her performing debut at 13. She recently released her second album, Anourag. What is your idea of perfect happiness? Lots of travel and performing, lots of close friends and pets, and a wonderful man to go home to - that last part is a bit down the road. What is your greatest fear? Being lonely. Which living person do you most admire? My father - aside from being an incredible musician, he's also the most caring, loving, humorous man. What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? I lose my temper when I'm stressed. What is the trait you most deplore in others? It's difficult to have relationships with people who can't compromise. What is your most unappealing habit? People get really annoyed at how often I crack my fingers and my neck. What makes you depressed? Because of how much I travel, it's easy to make friends, but difficult to make close friends. So it hurts me when I grow away from people I've been close to, even though I know how natural that is - I never really get over it. What is your favourite smell? I love to smell the few people that I'm very close to. It's incredibly comforting. What is your favourite fantasy? I have dreams about flying really often. It took me until I was nine or 10 to realise that I couldn't actually fly! It still disappoints me, because I know the feeling so clearly. Have you ever said 'I love you' and not meant it? Never, but I hate that sometimes I feel pressured to say, 'I love you, too'. What single thing would improve the quality of your life? A driver's licence! What would your motto be? Live in the moment, love without holding back, and have a job you enjoy. What keeps you awake at night? Things I said that I didn't mean; things I should've said and didn't. How would you like to be remembered? I would hate for people to say that I didn't live up to my father's name. And, aside from music, I want people to look back and say they were happy to have known me. What is the most important lesson life has taught you?

Remember, mummy or daddy may have sacrificed an important meeting that would've helped pay off the mortgage on the house in which your bedroom and toys are. </p> <p>In the sprint, you can't just run really fast anywhere - you have to run in between those white lines. Why? Because the International Olympic Committee says so, that's why. If, halfway up the course, all the other children are in front of you, it really doesn't matter where you run, because mummy and daddy won't be hanging around at the finish line to see you humiliated. </p> <p>In the egg-and-spoon race, the object is to get to the finishing post with your egg still on your spoon, not to see how many times you can drop it and pick it up. Other parents may find this cute and funny, but yours won't, and they're the ones with the keys to the front door. </p> <p>Refereeing is often lax, even non-existent, in this event. So, even though you won't have time to glue your egg to your spoon, you can pick a spoon with greater concavity than others. Ask your mother for a soup ladle, if possible. When you find yourself neck and neck with other kids, simply put your thumb on your egg and run a bit faster. After all, no one's going to ask for a steward's enquiry because you're only a kid. </p> <p>Children who are not naturally athletic are advised to focus on the three-legged race. Avoid teaming up with your best friend; he may have great toys, but in the co-ordination department he's a bit of a dork. Pick someone with the same leg-length as you and then walk quickly to school with him for the rest of term until lockstep becomes second nature. </p> <p>If you're the big porky boy in the class, pick the weediest boy in your class to run with. Don't worry about his stride pattern or anything else. Just drag him along as fast as you can go. If you've tied your knots right, he will still be there at the finishing line. </p> <p>School sports days often have a parents' race, too. This is different from kids' races and is not competitive. When your daddy finishes seventh or eighth, that is good. But console him with the fact that the other adults are in too much of a hurry and are probably showing off. If you have won your race and your daddy hasn't, don't mention sports day for a few weeks.</p>",

Other parents may find this cute and funny, but yours won't, and they're the ones with the keys to the front door. Refereeing is often lax, even non-existent, in this event. So, even though you won't have time to glue your egg to your spoon, you can pick a spoon with greater concavity than others. Ask your mother for a soup ladle, if possible. When you find yourself neck and neck with other kids, simply put your thumb on your egg and run a bit faster. After all, no one's going to ask for a steward's enquiry because you're only a kid. Children who are not naturally athletic are advised to focus on the three-legged race. Avoid teaming up with your best friend; he may have great toys, but in the co-ordination department he's a bit of a dork. Pick someone with the same leg-length as you and then walk quickly to school with him for the rest of term until lockstep becomes second nature. If you're the big porky boy in the class, pick the weediest boy in your class to run with. Don't worry about his stride pattern or anything else. Just drag him along as fast as you can go. If you've tied your knots right, he will still be there at the finishing line. School sports days often have a parents' race, too. This is different from kids' races and is not competitive. When your daddy finishes seventh or eighth, that is good. But console him with the fact that the other adults are in too much of a hurry and are probably showing off. If you have won your race and your daddy hasn't, don't mention sports day for a few weeks.",

Coming from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which had opened specially for him in the middle of the night, it was a strange audio experience: Bruce, alone with lots of waxwork figures of people like Clappo and Chuck \"Ding-a-Ling\" Berry, surrounded by cases of memorabilia.

And so they did, at least by telephone. Duane Eddy called, burbling on about how he used a water tank to make music. Then, while Bruce inspected the controversial John Lennon exhibits (including the smashed and bloodstained glasses he was wearing the night he was shot), Yoko Ono called via the white telephone that sits in the museum. She calls once a fortnight, talks to whoever picks up the phone. \"People are thrilled when I call,\" she said by way of an ice-breaker. </p> <p>That may have something to do with the fact that she sounds on the howling-at-the-moon side of crackers. Ono does this curious little laugh, not unlike Michael Crawford as Frank Spencer, after each of her weird interjections. The phone, she begins, is \"a talking sculpture\". (Small strange laugh.) It's good to exhibit Lennon's things, she continues. \"It's my new work! It's conceptual!\" (Big strange laugh.)

Ayres changed the subject to the humiliation she met with on her last Welsh trip. She mentioned it several times in fact, so deeply has it scarred her. Invited to the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival in 1994, Ayres thought she might be opening proceedings, or doing the raffle at least. \"I took my two boys,\" she said, ladling on the pathos. \"Because of my accent they said, 'Stand in this pigsty and smile winsomely.'\" One can only wonder what they might have asked of Yoko Ono.</p>",

Their average price is \u00a38.67. </p> <p>You might well protest - 'Why didn't the fellow just make up the case and give us a 12th wine? - but this perfectly logical query can be answered only by saying that nothing is logical where Oddbins is concerned. </p> <p>I'll open with a trebbiano (or ugni blanc, as the French, who mostly use it to distil into cognac, call the grape disdainfully). This is an unsung white grape, not inspirational of bardic extravagances, and so a specimen that costs \u00a38.99 must have a lot going for it to rate 17 points. It does: Marramiero Altare Trebbiano d'Abruzzo 1998 is the liveliest trebbiano I've ever tasted. It has gorgeous wood integration, gently yoghurty, with complex, unfolding layers of rich fruit: marvellously classy stuff. Comte Cathare Le Parfait, a non-vintage Vin de Pays d'Oc blanc, is half this price at \u00a34.49, but still shows superb balance of plump fruit and gently insistent acidity. Stylishly baked and finely sliced, with underlying warmth and generosity, it rates 16 points. </p> <p>Petaluma Riesling Clare Valley 1999 (17.5 points, \u00a39.49, Fine Wine Stores only), from Australia, has fantastic mineral acidity, and undertones with rich fruit reminiscent of gooseberry and limes. It has a wonderful texture, on the fat side perhaps, yet also refreshing, and is not only great drinking now but will age well for years. Another Australian is Cullen Sauvignon/Semillon Margaret River 1999 (18 points, \u00a311.49, Fine Wine Stores only), which is about as elongated, as satisfying from nose to throat and as sexy as a young white wine from this continent gets.

      "bodyText": "The 11 wines that follow are all available at Oddbins - some are available only at this retailer, in fact - and their average rating is 17.5 points out of 20. Their average price is \u00a38.67. You might well protest - 'Why didn't the fellow just make up the case and give us a 12th wine? - but this perfectly logical query can be answered only by saying that nothing is logical where Oddbins is concerned. I'll open with a trebbiano (or ugni blanc, as the French, who mostly use it to distil into cognac, call the grape disdainfully). This is an unsung white grape, not inspirational of bardic extravagances, and so a specimen that costs \u00a38.99 must have a lot going for it to rate 17 points. It does: Marramiero Altare Trebbiano d'Abruzzo 1998 is the liveliest trebbiano I've ever tasted. It has gorgeous wood integration, gently yoghurty, with complex, unfolding layers of rich fruit: marvellously classy stuff. Comte Cathare Le Parfait, a non-vintage Vin de Pays d'Oc blanc, is half this price at \u00a34.49, but still shows superb balance of plump fruit and gently insistent acidity. Stylishly baked and finely sliced, with underlying warmth and generosity, it rates 16 points. Petaluma Riesling Clare Valley 1999 (17.5 points, \u00a39.49, Fine Wine Stores only), from Australia, has fantastic mineral acidity, and undertones with rich fruit reminiscent of gooseberry and limes. It has a wonderful texture, on the fat side perhaps, yet also refreshing, and is not only great drinking now but will age well for years. Another Australian is Cullen Sauvignon/Semillon Margaret River 1999 (18 points, \u00a311.49, Fine Wine Stores only), which is about as elongated, as satisfying from nose to throat and as sexy as a young white wine from this continent gets. Complex, textured and majestically quaffable, this is serious, thought-provoking tippling. Heggies Viognier Eden Valley 1999 (18 points, \u00a312.99, Fine Wine Stores only) also has to be pedestalled, for it is the fittest, finest, most delicious Australian viognier I've yet encountered - it can only be compared with the legendary (but often scandalously disappointing) exemplar, Condrieu, in a great year and from a scrupulously managed vineyard.

      "body": "<p>Chris Blackwell's memories of Strawberry Hill, a Blue Mountains estate hovering 3,000ft above Kingston, Jamaica, go back a long way. \"I used to come here for Sunday tea with my mother when I was a little boy, and I've always had a sentimental feeling about this place,\" says the entrepreneur and one-time owner of Island Records.</p> <p>Strawberry Hill originated as an 18th-century coffee plantation, and Blackwell bought it in 1972 to use as a personal retreat. It was here in 1976 that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Bob Marley, recuperated from gunshot wounds after a politically motivated attempt on his life. In 1988, its Great House was destroyed by Hurricane Gilbert.</p> <p>Blackwell began planning to develop the estate with a traditional Jamaican planter-style building at its centre. To do this, he hired architect Ann Hodges, who had grown up in Jamaica and trained in London. She created a new spin on Jamaican traditional architecture, using vernacular pitched roofs, decorative fretwork and over-large roof eaves extended to a point of exaggeration, allowing guests to sit outdoors and remain comfortably dry during rainstorms.</p> <p>The 12 guest cottages are modelled on traditional Jamaican chattel houses, and the interiors are also typical of the island. Furnishings include planter chairs and mahogany four-poster beds shrouded with muslin mosquito netting. Interiors are crisp and white, giving a contemporary feel to the neo-colonial, romantic style of the furniture.</p> <p>Interiors and exteriors are embellished with clever fretwork designs, which remind me of flourishes in a 30s Essex bungalow of my childhood, and make me wonder why this excellent and inexpensive device is not used more often, limited, as it is, only by the imagination. Whatever happened to the fret-saw?</p> <p>As a result of Britain's 300-year colonisation of Jamaica, the island is dotted with impressive Georgian-style Great Houses, each the seat of a huge sugar cane plantation, and resembling the great haciendas of Latin America.</p> <p>A smaller-scale Georgian building, Itopia, was originally the dower house to Cardiff Hall Great House, on the north coast. Surrounded by rainforest, Itopia is the home of author-director Perry Henzell, who directed the reggae movie, The Harder They Come, and his artist wife, Sally.</p> <p>Itopia has been both family home and creative retreat since the Henzells discovered it more than 20 years ago. Perry has written several novels in the house, and it is the perfect retreat. There is no telephone, and drop-in visits are rare: situated in a rural area of maze-like lanes entirely unencumbered by street names or house labelling, it is almost impossible to find.</p> <p>The Henzells christened the place Itopia, playing on the Rastafarian expression \"I and I\", which means \"one with God\". It is built of locally cut stone, and maximises the use of natural ventilation to keep everything cool. English-style sash windows are bordered by louvred openings that encourage air-flow, and the interior is open to the roof pitch to allow heated air to rise and the cooler air to stay at living level.</p> <p>The house is decorated with a cheerfully eclectic mix of family furniture, local antiques and junk-shop finds accumulated over the years. The original plan was to repaint the interiors, but Sally fell in love with the mix of colours revealed as the old paint was stripped away. The richly decorative effect that the couple settled on was achieved by the unorthodox technique of scraping at the walls with a machete.</p> <p>Colours - brilliant pinks, yellows and reds - are the predominant influence on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which boasts more than 2,000 miles of landscape, ranging from the dry desert of Baja California in the north to the states of Chiapas, Guerrero and Oazala in the south - a land of coconut palms, jungle and tropical humidity.</p> <p>With their palapa, or thatched, roofs, and curved walls, houses of the Mexican Pacific have evolved a distinctive style. Thanks to the warm climate, it is possible to live outdoors throughout the year, with homes open to the elements. This living-with-nature lifestyle is a recent development, however. Until the 70s, international modernism was the style of choice in many Mexican coastal developments.</p> <p>Then, in the mid-70s, Gloria Guinness and her husband, Loel, visited Acapulco and decided to build a holiday home. Searching for inspiration, Gloria noticed the indigenous thatched huts that adorned the local beaches. Together with a local architect, Mario Aldaco, she developed a new kind of resort house with a thatched palapa roof - an architecture without glass, with open-plan living areas.</p> <p>Today, the spiritual home of palapa living is the elegant Costa Careyes, a tiny bay shielded by rocky headlands two hours' drive south of Puerto Vallarta. A village of colourful casitas (small houses) surrounds the harbour and a series of glamorous palapa-style houses edge the cliffs on either side, facing the ocean.</p> <p>The festive Casa Dos Estrellas is a recent addition, reflecting the joie de vivre of its owners, actress (and former James Bond girl) Luciana Paluzzi and her movie producer husband, Michael Solomon. Designed by architect Manolo Mestre, it straddles a spectacular site on the southern headland of Careyes harbour, with sweeping 360-degree views of the coastline and numerous islets, the bay and the village of Costa Careyes.</p> <p>Interiors of the Solomon house are bright and colourful, matching the hues of the bougainvillaea on the terraces, with Mestra-designed wood and rattan tables and chairs grouped in front of built-in banquettes. Sleeping platforms, shelves and counters are similarly built-in, giving the place a streamlined feel. \"Cured profiles everywhere are good feng shui,\" says Mestre. \"Curves between the floor, the walls, and the ceilings keep the energies flowing. Loel Guinness used to talk about his bedroom in Acapulco, also with the same curvatures: 'There is no place where the eye stops, allowing you to dream as you go to sleep.'\"</p> <p>Various decorative treatments reinforce the indigenous folklore theme. Floors are decorated with flowing patterns of inset pebbles. In the guest bedroom, stencilled patterns surrounding the bed echo those on primitive painted ceramic pots.</p> <p>Mestre's portfolio also includes a collaboration with Isabel Goldsmith on her 90-acre Las Alamandas estate that she inherited from her grandfather, Antenor Pati\u00f1o, in 1978. Pati\u00f1o had major plans for Las Alamandas, intending to create a resort as grand as his earlier creation, Las Hadas, in Acapulco.</p> <p>When Isabel took over Las Alamandas, situated on a lonely stretch of the Pacific coast and a 90-minute drive south of Puerto Vallarta, it consisted of an infrastructure of unpaved roads cut into the jungle, a landing strip for small planes and little else. She fell in love with this remote paradise with its perfect half-mile long beach, its lagoons rich in wildlife and its setting of low hills covered in trees and cacti.</p> <p>She had no intention, however, of creating a miniature Acapulco. Instead, working first with architect Gabriel Orosco, and later Mestre after Orosco's death, she concentrated on building a small group of villas that friends might visit. Using her own interpretation of the vibrant colours of Mexico, Isabel created a festive mood for the place, together with an architecture which is unashamedly romantic.</p> <p>The rooms are furnished in the folklore-style that Isabel loves, with indigenous rustic wood furniture including local wood and pigskin equipal chairs. Mestre designed four-poster beds made with local timber. Upholstering and fabrics are simple, woven in Mexico.</p> <p>Back in Careyes, La Quebrada was designed by Italian architect and restaurateur Duccio Ermenegildo as a family home, although it is now owned by an English pop musician. It sits serenely on a cliff near the harbour with a 180-degree view of the Pacific - reminding the architect of the Amalfi coast. Ermenegildo is fond of visual surprises, and this house reveals itself stage by stage.</p> <p>\"I wanted there to be a sense of discovery,\" he says. The house is screened from the private street by high walls, as is the curved entry path that leads to a small piazza with a fountain. From here, the thatched roof of the 36ft-high living-and-dining room palapa and the separate bedroom tower reveal themselves. Between them, a narrow, stepped path edged with palms descends to the front terrace. Here, the senses are fully awakened, for beyond the living areas is a cascade of steps opening on to a vast panorama of blue - the ocean, the pool and the sky.</p> <p>Ermenegildo has taken the usual Careyes look in a more rigorous modernist direction. \"My dream was to marry minimalism with exotic local materials.\" The result, painted the orange of the poinciana flower, its edges defined by sinuous curves, is sensual and festive.</p> <p>Concrete was used in the construction, and its organic properties are utilised for built-in banquettes in the living areas and bedrooms. The bathrooms have tubs moulded from a mixture of powdered marble, granite chips and cement, which was sanded and then waxed to give it a velvety-smooth finish.

Fumbling around, I managed to prepare everything and lay the table. The bell rang just as I was zipping up my slinky Versace gown. Half-seeing Alan's sweet face made me yearn for him even more . . . We sipped champagne and exchanged sweet nothings; the atmosphere became really charged. I asked him to bring in the turkey and carve - the first of his manly duties that evening - while I lit the candles.</p> <p>I thought I had fitted candles into the Murano glassholders, but the half-seen creamy cylinders on a shelf turned out to be something quite different: the left-over Big Bertha, Royal Jewels and other fireworks I had ordered from <a href=\"http://www.Kaboomfireworks.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.Kaboomfireworks.com</a> for Guy Fawkes Night. In a second, my loft was a riot of comets, shooting stars and fireballs in all the colours of the rainbow. Crazed by the explosions, Migraine Alan flung the turkey out of the window and fled.

      "bodyText": "The US election cliffhanger made me realise how entwined our cultures are, so I decided to celebrate Thanksgiving - \u00e0 deux, because Migraine Alan is back (he still limps a bit, but otherwise he's made a full recovery). I found delicious recipes for turkey with herbal rub, jalape\u00f1o cornbread stuffing, guilt-free gravy, scalloped potatoes, and pumpkin-and-praline pie at www. holidays.net/thanksgiving, and I got a fabulous organic turkey from www.foodferry.co.uk. While chopping onions, I removed my contacts to cry freely, but then I couldn't find them again. Fumbling around, I managed to prepare everything and lay the table. The bell rang just as I was zipping up my slinky Versace gown. Half-seeing Alan's sweet face made me yearn for him even more . . . We sipped champagne and exchanged sweet nothings; the atmosphere became really charged. I asked him to bring in the turkey and carve - the first of his manly duties that evening - while I lit the candles. I thought I had fitted candles into the Murano glassholders, but the half-seen creamy cylinders on a shelf turned out to be something quite different: the left-over Big Bertha, Royal Jewels and other fireworks I had ordered from www.Kaboomfireworks.com for Guy Fawkes Night. In a second, my loft was a riot of comets, shooting stars and fireballs in all the colours of the rainbow. Crazed by the explosions, Migraine Alan flung the turkey out of the window and fled. By the time the fire brigade arrived, I was alone again. Luckily, the damage was not as serious as I had thought, and one of the firemen was really cute. He offered to come back to give me some fire-protection advice.

      "body": "<p>How many people can remember the Great War of the Californias? Initially known as the War Of The Cities, it lasted for seven months, left 20,000 dead and saw hand-to-hand combat from Lake Tahoe to Tijuana. One of its heroes was a Mexican immigrant labourer with a bad back, and one of its bravest units was composed of 11-year-olds. It pitched Los Angeles against San Francisco, and more than 3 million Californians took up arms in defence of their cities. </p> <p>It was also the first war in which the battleships were sponsored by Visa and Mastercard, in which a gay brigade marched behind a rainbow flag and in which one of the generals greeted the final peace agreements with the words \"make it a tequila with lime\". </p> <p>Fortunately, for those who may have only a dim recollection of the war or who wonder if they have ever heard of it at all, it has now been commemorated in all its horror or heroism in the exhibition, In Smog And Thunder, Historical Works From The Great War Of The Californias. It pays tribute to those unsung combatants who made the ultimate sacrifice defending the Getty Centre or who perished in the assault on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco, a battle that would later be known as Bloody Telly. </p> <p>The war itself took place not so much on the burning freeways of LA or beneath the fog shrouding the Golden Gate bridge, but in the imagination of Sandow Birk, a 35-year-old artist from Long Beach. Over a period of years he has taken every form of war art, from the epic paintings of Goya, Delacroix and Jacques-Louis David to the recruitment posters of the first world war, to create an 80-piece exhibition illustrating an imaginary war between the two great, growling rival Pacific coast cities of LA and San Francisco. </p> <p>Birk's next Big Idea - painting all the prisons of California in the style of the great landscape artists - also uses classical and traditional art forms to deliver the sort of edgy, contemporary message that might otherwise be shunned. His work has also opened up a discussion on the \"museumification\" of America, where events or people are treated with a solemnity that they may not always merit. But first, to the War. </p> <p>As a \"southlander\", Birk was always puzzled on his trips to San Francisco to encounter the deep loathing felt by many in the Bay Area for LA, which was seen as vulgar, bloated, exploitative, Disneyfied, uncultured, greedy and smoggy. While Angelenos did not feel quite the same visceral hatred for their northern relative, there was a simmering disdain for San Francisco as prissy, old-fashioned, pleased-with-itself and foggy. What if they took this mutual dislike to its logical conclusion, pondered Birk, and declared war? </p> <p>So Birk took his idea to its logical conclusion and commemorated just such a war in a series of paintings in the style of the great classical artists' renditions of famous battles and retreats. He has taken all the iconography of war, the etchings and stiff military portraits and patriotic posters from Napoleonic times to the Falklands, and used them for his own fictional battlefields and heroes, from General James Walker, \"who had lost his virginity unsatisfactorily at a Grateful Dead concert in his teens and despised the City [San Francisco] ever since\", to the dashing young Colonel Don Ho Park, who was followed loyally by the WeHo Boys from West Hollywood, \"leather chaps, manly men, who needed no uniforms\". And who can forget Captain Chun Yeong Chang's battalion of 11-year-old computer programmers, or the hemp farmers of Big Sur, who joined the battle only because they feared that the approaching troops were members of the Drugs Enforcement Administration out to trash their crops? From Lieutenant Quincy Salino, sabre drawn and charging forward on a Ducati motorcycle, to the Great Battle of Los Angeles, every key participant and event is recorded. </p> <p>The exhibition is accompanied by a soundtrack on a CD in which the battles are vividly recreated with the sound of gunfire and martial music. The attention to detail has its own epic scale. The LA cavalry horses in the battles have Nike swooshes on their flanks, one poster appeals for \"porno for our men in camp and down there\", and twin LA battleships are named the Richard M Nixon and the Bebe Rebozo. Hovering above the struggle are the two muses of the city - for LA, a pregnant Latina holding a skateboard and an Oscar; for San Francisco, an Asian woman in 501 Levis, a tie-dyed T-shirt and a SF Giants baseball cap. </p> <p>Shown this autumn in its final and full version in Laguna Art Museum, in Laguna Beach, south of Los Angeles, the exhibition has won the sort of effusive plaudits for Birk that must have been quietly gratifying to those who have been buying his paintings - they include actor Nicolas Cage, Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Brazilian pop star Caetano Veloso. Now the exhibition is due to head north to Sonoma, where Birk's renditions of the great sea battles and the hand-to-hand combat on the freeways can be studied by the locals there. The bold nature of the venture has struck a nerve in the sometimes complacent art world of southern California. </p> <p>Art critic Marcia Tanner wrote of it: \"Revealing truth through fiction is the artist's task, and Birk challenges the spectacle with a counter-spectacle of his own. He treads on sensitive ground here. We Americans are sentimental about our relatively shallow past even as we trash it. We tend to exaggerate and glorify what little history we do have and fabricate what we lack.\" So it is seen as appropriate that Birk should use the form of war museums - what Umberto Eco called \"cathedrals of iconic reassurance\" - to tell his tale. \"Like all good satirists, Birk's underlying intentions are serious,\" wrote Claudine Ise of the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum. </p> <p>In the meantime, another equally provocative and imaginative body of work is being assembled by Birk in LA: the prisonisation of California. Stunned to discover that California now jails a higher percentage of its population than anywhere else in the world, Birk embarked on the project of visiting all 32 of the jails in the state. He is painting them all in the style of landscape artists such as Joseph Turner and John Constable, so that the eye is drawn to what looks like a conventionally-rendered idyllic rural scene only to spot the jail buildings somewhere in the background. </p> <p>The artist behind these prolific and seriously mischievous enterprises is the son of a car industry father and teacher mother, who grew up in the sunny southlands and looks more surfer than satirist, not least because he is almost as dedicated to surfing - and as good at it - as he is to art. One of the main reasons for having his studio in the slightly run-down Latino and Cambodian area of Long Beach is that it is not far from the waves of Huntington Beach and San Pedro. </p> <p>After starting his art training at what is now the Otis College of Art and Design in LA, Birk dropped out and headed for Brazil, where he survived for two years by making surfboards and art-designing a surfing magazine; he is a specialist in the lamination of surfboards. But he returned to his studies in 1984 and, as part of an exchange programme, went to study first in Paris and then at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham, which he remembers as a village \"with little stone walls and fields and sheep\". </p> <p>He chose Bath mainly because of its proximity to surfing beaches: \"We would travel out to the Gower Peninsula and then across the cow fields and go surfing.\" After two years of conventional art studies, he liked the freedom at the academy: \"The school itself was excellent, probably the best I went to. Basically, they gave you a room to paint in and let you do what you wanted, and they had all these professional artists come around and talk to you and steer you. It was great, it was super-liberating.\" </p> <p>There were two other side-benefits of studying in Paris and England. The first was the chance to visit the Louvre every day and, when in London, the Tate: \"The big romantic 19th-century salon painting was super-impressive to me.\" He liked George Stubbs's horse paintings and Turner's seascapes, as well as the British war artists, whose work he was later to use as inspiration. The second bonus was the opportunity to skateboard beneath the Eiffel Tower, around the fountains of the Place de La Concorde and along the South Bank. </p> <p>Birk returned to LA to finish his studies and rented a store-front studio in South Central, the heart of the city's black community. Inspired by the title of Charles Dickens's A Tale Of Two Cities, he catalogued the gang battles of the time between the Crips and the Bloods, the drive-by shootings, the sudden explosions of violence. By chance, his first exhibition opened just three weeks before the LA riots of 1992, which came in response to the acquittal of four white police officers for the beating of Rodney King. Birk's work was suddenly seen to have a prescient resonance and people assumed that, because of his South Central address, his themes and his ambiguous name, he was black. At least one would-be collector who made boyz in the hood-type films decided not to invest after discovering that Birk was white. </p> <p>Birk's next project will be to take the Rake's Progress by William Hogarth - whose work he loves - and use it to tell the story of Rafael Perez, the corrupt LAPD officer who was caught stealing cocaine from a police locker, decided to inform on his former colleagues in return for a sentence of five years, and is now the centre of the biggest corruption scandal in the city's history. Perez's revelations about shooting unarmed gang members, planting weapons and recycling cocaine have shocked the city and led to more than 100 cases being reopened and an as yet unknown number of officers facing charges. Now he will be immortalised by Birk. </p> <p>Birk has had some criticism of his work, however. \"Some have said that my stuff is technically not up to the art that I am copying - which is true - and one said I was being flippant and shallow, which I don't think I am being.\" </p> <p>The idea of a war between LA and San Francisco need not be seen as exclusively Californian, because it taps all the resentments between competitive cities; it is not hard to imagine, say, an angry Liverpool invading London, Glasgow laying waste to Edinburgh or Sydney sacking Melbourne. But who actually emerged as victor? \"I never really say who won. I think of the whole project in terms of art history, while other people think in terms of the politics. Part of my intention was to play on the idea of the museum. They don't explain everything to you in a museum - you're supposed to know what happened when you go into the Gettysburg museum - so I wanted to use that attitude.\" What is clear is that Tijuana, the bad-boy town just south of the border, eventually comes to the rescue of LA. </p> <p>\"Tijuana has such a bad reputation that I like to bring it in often. There is the whole anti-Mexican thing, keeping them out, so I just thought it would be so cool to bring them all in suddenly. The people we most look down on would be the ones to save us. Somehow in the end the underdog would win and Tijuana would be the new capital of southern California.\" </p> <p>He has also gradually come to explore the \"museumification\" of America, a country which has museums for everything from lingerie (Fredericks's Lingerie Museum in Hollywood ) to newspapers (the Newseum in Arlington, Virginia) and Tolerance (the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles.) \"It's like America is trying to build a history where there isn't one; they're trying to build a history where things are only 10 years old,\" says Birk, who exudes the sort of sunny charm that befits someone who carries a surfboard under one arm and an easel under the other. \"There is a museum for every single president, 42 museums or something; as soon as you become president, the house you were born in becomes a museum. I've been driving around California a lot looking at these prisons and all these little towns are so grasping at anything. There's 'the artichoke capital', the 'more flowers than anywhere' place, the museum of mining.\" </p> <p>He says he is often asked what other contemporary artists he admires, and he never knows what to say. \"Should I say Damien Hirst? I think that guy gets enough publicity! I haven't seen his stuff, but I like what he's doing, and I want to see one of the cows. In Los Angeles, Ed Rusche is consistently good and Vernon Fisher from Texas.\" </p> <p>Maybe in 100 years' time, the Great War Of The Californias will have its permanent home in a museum and will be earnestly studied by students uncertain of whether it was true that Silicon Valley secretly betrayed its neighbours in San Francisco or whether Las Vegas really declined to assist LA but instead offered the desperate General Gomez \"a coupon for three free spins at our $10 roulette\". And Sandow Birk will be puzzling the art historians as they try to work out how galleons had Visa logos on their sails in the 90s and whether the third battalion of the LA brigades was really led by \"a struggling actress from Fresno . . . hoping for the starring role that had always eluded her\" .</p>",

      "bodyText": "How many people can remember the Great War of the Californias? Initially known as the War Of The Cities, it lasted for seven months, left 20,000 dead and saw hand-to-hand combat from Lake Tahoe to Tijuana. One of its heroes was a Mexican immigrant labourer with a bad back, and one of its bravest units was composed of 11-year-olds. It pitched Los Angeles against San Francisco, and more than 3 million Californians took up arms in defence of their cities. It was also the first war in which the battleships were sponsored by Visa and Mastercard, in which a gay brigade marched behind a rainbow flag and in which one of the generals greeted the final peace agreements with the words \"make it a tequila with lime\". Fortunately, for those who may have only a dim recollection of the war or who wonder if they have ever heard of it at all, it has now been commemorated in all its horror or heroism in the exhibition, In Smog And Thunder, Historical Works From The Great War Of The Californias. It pays tribute to those unsung combatants who made the ultimate sacrifice defending the Getty Centre or who perished in the assault on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco, a battle that would later be known as Bloody Telly. The war itself took place not so much on the burning freeways of LA or beneath the fog shrouding the Golden Gate bridge, but in the imagination of Sandow Birk, a 35-year-old artist from Long Beach. Over a period of years he has taken every form of war art, from the epic paintings of Goya, Delacroix and Jacques-Louis David to the recruitment posters of the first world war, to create an 80-piece exhibition illustrating an imaginary war between the two great, growling rival Pacific coast cities of LA and San Francisco. Birk's next Big Idea - painting all the prisons of California in the style of the great landscape artists - also uses classical and traditional art forms to deliver the sort of edgy, contemporary message that might otherwise be shunned. His work has also opened up a discussion on the \"museumification\" of America, where events or people are treated with a solemnity that they may not always merit. But first, to the War. As a \"southlander\", Birk was always puzzled on his trips to San Francisco to encounter the deep loathing felt by many in the Bay Area for LA, which was seen as vulgar, bloated, exploitative, Disneyfied, uncultured, greedy and smoggy. While Angelenos did not feel quite the same visceral hatred for their northern relative, there was a simmering disdain for San Francisco as prissy, old-fashioned, pleased-with-itself and foggy. What if they took this mutual dislike to its logical conclusion, pondered Birk, and declared war? So Birk took his idea to its logical conclusion and commemorated just such a war in a series of paintings in the style of the great classical artists' renditions of famous battles and retreats. He has taken all the iconography of war, the etchings and stiff military portraits and patriotic posters from Napoleonic times to the Falklands, and used them for his own fictional battlefields and heroes, from General James Walker, \"who had lost his virginity unsatisfactorily at a Grateful Dead concert in his teens and despised the City [San Francisco] ever since\", to the dashing young Colonel Don Ho Park, who was followed loyally by the WeHo Boys from West Hollywood, \"leather chaps, manly men, who needed no uniforms\". And who can forget Captain Chun Yeong Chang's battalion of 11-year-old computer programmers, or the hemp farmers of Big Sur, who joined the battle only because they feared that the approaching troops were members of the Drugs Enforcement Administration out to trash their crops? From Lieutenant Quincy Salino, sabre drawn and charging forward on a Ducati motorcycle, to the Great Battle of Los Angeles, every key participant and event is recorded. The exhibition is accompanied by a soundtrack on a CD in which the battles are vividly recreated with the sound of gunfire and martial music. The attention to detail has its own epic scale. The LA cavalry horses in the battles have Nike swooshes on their flanks, one poster appeals for \"porno for our men in camp and down there\", and twin LA battleships are named the Richard M Nixon and the Bebe Rebozo. Hovering above the struggle are the two muses of the city - for LA, a pregnant Latina holding a skateboard and an Oscar; for San Francisco, an Asian woman in 501 Levis, a tie-dyed T-shirt and a SF Giants baseball cap. Shown this autumn in its final and full version in Laguna Art Museum, in Laguna Beach, south of Los Angeles, the exhibition has won the sort of effusive plaudits for Birk that must have been quietly gratifying to those who have been buying his paintings - they include actor Nicolas Cage, Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Brazilian pop star Caetano Veloso. Now the exhibition is due to head north to Sonoma, where Birk's renditions of the great sea battles and the hand-to-hand combat on the freeways can be studied by the locals there. The bold nature of the venture has struck a nerve in the sometimes complacent art world of southern California. Art critic Marcia Tanner wrote of it: \"Revealing truth through fiction is the artist's task, and Birk challenges the spectacle with a counter-spectacle of his own. He treads on sensitive ground here. We Americans are sentimental about our relatively shallow past even as we trash it. We tend to exaggerate and glorify what little history we do have and fabricate what we lack.\" So it is seen as appropriate that Birk should use the form of war museums - what Umberto Eco called \"cathedrals of iconic reassurance\" - to tell his tale. \"Like all good satirists, Birk's underlying intentions are serious,\" wrote Claudine Ise of the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum. In the meantime, another equally provocative and imaginative body of work is being assembled by Birk in LA: the prisonisation of California. Stunned to discover that California now jails a higher percentage of its population than anywhere else in the world, Birk embarked on the project of visiting all 32 of the jails in the state. He is painting them all in the style of landscape artists such as Joseph Turner and John Constable, so that the eye is drawn to what looks like a conventionally-rendered idyllic rural scene only to spot the jail buildings somewhere in the background. The artist behind these prolific and seriously mischievous enterprises is the son of a car industry father and teacher mother, who grew up in the sunny southlands and looks more surfer than satirist, not least because he is almost as dedicated to surfing - and as good at it - as he is to art. One of the main reasons for having his studio in the slightly run-down Latino and Cambodian area of Long Beach is that it is not far from the waves of Huntington Beach and San Pedro. After starting his art training at what is now the Otis College of Art and Design in LA, Birk dropped out and headed for Brazil, where he survived for two years by making surfboards and art-designing a surfing magazine; he is a specialist in the lamination of surfboards. But he returned to his studies in 1984 and, as part of an exchange programme, went to study first in Paris and then at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham, which he remembers as a village \"with little stone walls and fields and sheep\". He chose Bath mainly because of its proximity to surfing beaches: \"We would travel out to the Gower Peninsula and then across the cow fields and go surfing.\" After two years of conventional art studies, he liked the freedom at the academy: \"The school itself was excellent, probably the best I went to. Basically, they gave you a room to paint in and let you do what you wanted, and they had all these professional artists come around and talk to you and steer you. It was great, it was super-liberating.\" There were two other side-benefits of studying in Paris and England. The first was the chance to visit the Louvre every day and, when in London, the Tate: \"The big romantic 19th-century salon painting was super-impressive to me.\" He liked George Stubbs's horse paintings and Turner's seascapes, as well as the British war artists, whose work he was later to use as inspiration. The second bonus was the opportunity to skateboard beneath the Eiffel Tower, around the fountains of the Place de La Concorde and along the South Bank. Birk returned to LA to finish his studies and rented a store-front studio in South Central, the heart of the city's black community. Inspired by the title of Charles Dickens's A Tale Of Two Cities, he catalogued the gang battles of the time between the Crips and the Bloods, the drive-by shootings, the sudden explosions of violence. By chance, his first exhibition opened just three weeks before the LA riots of 1992, which came in response to the acquittal of four white police officers for the beating of Rodney King. Birk's work was suddenly seen to have a prescient resonance and people assumed that, because of his South Central address, his themes and his ambiguous name, he was black. At least one would-be collector who made boyz in the hood-type films decided not to invest after discovering that Birk was white. Birk's next project will be to take the Rake's Progress by William Hogarth - whose work he loves - and use it to tell the story of Rafael Perez, the corrupt LAPD officer who was caught stealing cocaine from a police locker, decided to inform on his former colleagues in return for a sentence of five years, and is now the centre of the biggest corruption scandal in the city's history.

      "body": "<p>Who kept the pomander - you know, that orange stuck with myriad cloves, which came wrapped in a little gold box and then had the wardrobe reeking long after Christmas? Next to the accursed potpourri, nothing in the line of homemade Yuletide gifts causes quite so much nostril abuse as the pomander. It made sense in the great days of Versailles, when the smell of that sprawling palace was so pungent that it would hit the nostrils miles before you clapped eyes on the place - but these days?</p> <p>Before I am strung up as a killjoy, let me say that I've got nothing against the idea of the DIY Christmas present. The tradition of giving a little something that is pretty and personal is an honourable one, going back to the times when there was not a great deal of pretty at all, when style and taste were as distant as the moon, except for small pockets of resistance in such shops as Elizabeth David and Habitat. Armagnac was rare, Pruneaux Four\u00e9es, from the Maison Sabat in Tours, were hard to come by, and olive oil was as exotic as myrrh.</p> <p>Nowadays, things are quite different, but price and indifferent quality make a mockery of much that is sold at this time of year. The delicatessens with those bottles containing floating twigs, leaves and berries, redolent of a drowned witch, take the biscuit. Is it really so difficult simply to buy a good olive oil, and then drop a chilli in it to make your very own Olio Santo?</p> <p>No, there's no need to be grand when it comes to the homemade Christmas present. The smallest gesture may make the deepest impression. When I rang my Mum to ask for a good recipe for fudge, or tablet, both of us simultaneously recalled the wee shop in Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, with its tiny windows full of bags of fudge in various flavours. It was a small shop, quite different from the celebrated Maison Sabat - which was so splendidly glamorous and its prunes so glorious - but my memory of eating those small squares of fudge that lovely afternoon in Tobermory is just as delightful and powerful. Happily, it is much easier to make fudge than it is to make the journey to Tobermory.</p> <p>Mincemeat may be an obvious gift, but answer truthfully: when was the last time you had a delicious homemade mince pie, warm from the oven, as opposed to the dull commercial variety?</p> <p>The same applies to the simple delight of plum chutney: a homemade chutney, as opposed to bought, has true texture, as the ingredients are chopped by hand and consequently require less cooking because there is less liquid to reduce. The added smell of spices and vinegar simmering together is very soothing during the pre-Christmas mayhem.</p> <p>And talking of spices, how about a jar of your own spice mix? I have a dread of cabin fever after Christmas, when we all feel over- fed and the temptations of the sofa and the TV prove irresistible. Outside it may be cold and the mood bleak. Then the first whiff of spices cooking gently in a pot of stew or soup brings on a feeling of well-being among everyone, and normal service is quickly resumed.</p> <p>A last small plea for fruit curd, as this is the time of year when all the citrus fruits are at their best. Also, curd can be put to plenty of uses, from topping a steamed fruit pudding, to filling a tart case, to spreading on hot buttered toast. Clementines are a favourite fruit of mine, and while the resulting curd may not have the resulting zing of one made with lemon, it nevertheless has a soft deliciousness all of its own. <br><br><b>Mincemeat</b><br> The blending of spices mixed through dried fruits, even the more mediocre varieties, is one of the more pleasurable jobs in the kitchen and can be done, advisedly, as early on in the winter as possible. It is worth noting that this lovely preserve is a treat to be savoured throughout the whole season, rather than simply at Christmas. A little fruit-filled pastry with a thin slice of spiced butter atop is as delightful in March as it is on Christmas Eve. Technically, it is almost indestructible, but to be on the safe side use it up within six months. <br> <br> <b> 750g apples (Churchill's or Cox's) </b></p> <p><b> 400g stoneless raisins </b></p> <p><b> 400g currants </b></p> <p><b> 150g mixed peel </b></p> <p><b> 400g suet </b></p> <p><b> 400g sultanas </b></p> <p><b> 60g whole almonds</b></p> <p><b>\u00bd tsp grated nutmeg</b></p> <p><b> \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon</b></p> <p><b>\u00bd tsp ground mace </b></p> <p><b> 375g muscovado sugar </b></p> <p><b> 1 lemon </b></p> <p><b> 1 orange </b></p> <p><b> 5 tbsp dark rum</b></p> <p>Peel and finely chop the apples. Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix together. Scrupulously clean and dry some jars, fill them with the mincemeat and seal. Label and date the jars, and store in a cool, dark place.</p> <p><b> Chocolate biscuit cake </b><br></p> <p><b> 250g plain chocolate </b></p> <p><b> 250g unsalted butter </b></p> <p><b> 2 very fresh eggs </b></p> <p><b> 2 level dssp caster sugar </b></p> <p><b> 250g digestive biscuits </b></p> <p><b> 1 small handful walnuts </b></p> <p><b> 1 heaped tbsp glac\u00e9 cherries </b></p> <p><b> 1 tbsp rum</b></p> <p>Put the chocolate and butter in a bowl and place over a pan of simmering water to melt. Put the eggs and sugar in another bowl, place over simmering water and whisk until pale, thickened and cooked through. Break the biscuits into small pieces, and roughly chop the walnuts and cherries. Combine the chocolate and egg mixture, then add the nuts, cherries and rum. Decant into a lightly buttered tupperware dish, and pop into the fridge to set.</p> <p>For an icing (optional):</p> <p><b> 60g plain chocolate </b></p> <p><b> 1 large tbsp of rum </b></p> <p><b> 60g unsalted butter</b></p> <p>Melt the chocolate with the rum. Cut the butter into small pieces and beat into the chocolate, a little at a time. Pour the icing over the cake swiftly before it sets.</p> <p><b> Fudge </b><br></p> <p><b> 1kg granulated sugar </b></p> <p><b> 125g unsalted butter </b></p> <p><b> 200ml fresh milk </b></p> <p><b>\u00bd vanilla pod, or 1 tsp vanilla extract </b></p> <p><b> 1 tin of condensed milk</b></p> <p>Put the sugar, butter and milk in a saucepan, then set it over a low heat and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. Pour in the condensed milk and vanilla pod (or extract) and turn up the heat. Boil for 20 minutes or so, then fold back your shirt sleeves and beat the fudge for 10 minutes with a wooden spoon. Under no circumstances do it in a machine. Pour into a lightly oiled tin and leave to set. Cut into squares, and store in an airtight tin. <br><br><b> Chocolate fudge </b><br>Most certainly of another time, one when there was such a thing as a sweetie shop. <br></p> <p><b> 290ml water </b></p> <p><b> 450g caster sugar </b></p> <p><b> 1 large can condensed milk </b></p> <p><b> 30g unsalted butter </b></p> <p><b> 110g very good dark chocolate </b></p> <p><b>\u00bd vanilla pod </b></p> <p><b> 1 pinch ground cinnamon (optional, but very good)</b></p> <p>Scrupulously clean and dry two shallow baking tins. Lightly oil them. Split the vanilla pod and scrape the seeds from within. Put the seeds with the sugar and water in a pot and heat gently, stirring to ensure that the sugar dissolves before the mixture comes to the boil. Add the condensed milk and butter to the pot. Boil, stirring from time to time, until the mixture leaves the side of the pot, or for about 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Melt the chocolate in a bowl over warm water. Stir the melted chocolate into the fudge mix, combine thoroughly, then pour into the tins. Cut the fudge into squares, and leave to set. Cut the set fudge into bite-sized squares, and store in an airtight tin.</p> <p><b> A good plum chutney</b><br> Come the deluge of fruit, a good chutney will make a considerable dent in any orchard of plenty. <br></p> <p><b> 1.5kg stoned plums </b></p> <p><b> 250g sliced onion </b></p> <p><b> 50g raisins </b></p> <p><b> 250g muscovado sugar </b></p> <p><b> 1 level tsp salt </b></p> <p><b> 2 cloves </b></p> <p><b> 1 big thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated </b></p> <p><b> 1 level tsp ground allspice </b></p> <p><b> 600ml good red-wine vinegar</b></p> <p>Place all the ingredients in a large stainless-steel pot and mix. Put the pan over a gentle heat and bring slowly to the boil. Let the brew simmer until it thickens and takes on the consistency of a chutney. (This part of the operation should take about 45 minutes.) Scrupulously clean some jars, fill them with the chutney and seal. A word of warning: don't use metal lids, because these will react with the vinegar. While it is understandable that everyone will be itching for a large spoonful, ideally the chutney should be allowed to mature for four to six weeks. So be patient.</p> <p><b> Clementine curd</b><br> Be aware when you are making this preserve that the juice content may vary from fruit to fruit, so a little adjustment in terms of the amount of individual ingredients may be required. Use within a month or so. <br></p> <p><b> 12 clementines </b></p> <p><b> 220g unsalted butter </b></p> <p><b> 500g caster sugar </b></p> <p><b> 10 very fresh eggs</b></p> <p>Carefully grate the zest from the clementines, taking care not to take any of the pith. (For those so inclined, measure some of the sugar in cubes, and use these to 'grate' the zest from the clementines.) Squeeze out the juice from the fruit, then place this, along with the zest and all the other ingredients, in a large bowl and sit it upon a pan of simmering water. Stir from time to time, until the mixture begins to thicken, then stir frequently until the mixture has reached the required curd-like consistency. Have ready some jars, which have been cleaned, dried and warmed, tip the curd into them, then label and date them accordingly.</p> <p><b>A good spice mix</b><br>A spice mix that will produce a pot of vegetables, or vegetables and meats, or soup, to soothe even the most jaded Christmas palate and restore comfort and well-being. This is the culinary equivalent of Alka-Seltzer - in other words, its properties are bang on for this time of year. Use within three months. <br></p> <p><b> 3 tbsp coriander seeds </b></p> <p><b> 8 tsp cumin seeds </b></p> <p><b> 2 tsp turmeric </b></p> <p><b> 3 blades mace </b></p> <p><b>\u00bd stick cinnamon</b></p> <p><b>\u00bd nutmeg </b></p> <p><b> 3 cloves </b></p> <p><b> 8 green cardamom pods </b></p> <p><b> 1 tsp fennel seeds</b></p> <p><b> \u00bd tsp whole fenugreek </b></p> <p><b> 2 tbsp paprika </b></p> <p><b> 1 level tsp cayenne pepper</b></p> <p>Put all the spices in a coffee mill (you'll have to do this in batches), and grind to a powder.

      "bodyText": "Who kept the pomander - you know, that orange stuck with myriad cloves, which came wrapped in a little gold box and then had the wardrobe reeking long after Christmas? Next to the accursed potpourri, nothing in the line of homemade Yuletide gifts causes quite so much nostril abuse as the pomander. It made sense in the great days of Versailles, when the smell of that sprawling palace was so pungent that it would hit the nostrils miles before you clapped eyes on the place - but these days? Before I am strung up as a killjoy, let me say that I've got nothing against the idea of the DIY Christmas present. The tradition of giving a little something that is pretty and personal is an honourable one, going back to the times when there was not a great deal of pretty at all, when style and taste were as distant as the moon, except for small pockets of resistance in such shops as Elizabeth David and Habitat. Armagnac was rare, Pruneaux Four\u00e9es, from the Maison Sabat in Tours, were hard to come by, and olive oil was as exotic as myrrh. Nowadays, things are quite different, but price and indifferent quality make a mockery of much that is sold at this time of year. The delicatessens with those bottles containing floating twigs, leaves and berries, redolent of a drowned witch, take the biscuit. Is it really so difficult simply to buy a good olive oil, and then drop a chilli in it to make your very own Olio Santo? No, there's no need to be grand when it comes to the homemade Christmas present. The smallest gesture may make the deepest impression. When I rang my Mum to ask for a good recipe for fudge, or tablet, both of us simultaneously recalled the wee shop in Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, with its tiny windows full of bags of fudge in various flavours. It was a small shop, quite different from the celebrated Maison Sabat - which was so splendidly glamorous and its prunes so glorious - but my memory of eating those small squares of fudge that lovely afternoon in Tobermory is just as delightful and powerful. Happily, it is much easier to make fudge than it is to make the journey to Tobermory. Mincemeat may be an obvious gift, but answer truthfully: when was the last time you had a delicious homemade mince pie, warm from the oven, as opposed to the dull commercial variety? The same applies to the simple delight of plum chutney: a homemade chutney, as opposed to bought, has true texture, as the ingredients are chopped by hand and consequently require less cooking because there is less liquid to reduce. The added smell of spices and vinegar simmering together is very soothing during the pre-Christmas mayhem. And talking of spices, how about a jar of your own spice mix? I have a dread of cabin fever after Christmas, when we all feel over- fed and the temptations of the sofa and the TV prove irresistible. Outside it may be cold and the mood bleak. Then the first whiff of spices cooking gently in a pot of stew or soup brings on a feeling of well-being among everyone, and normal service is quickly resumed. A last small plea for fruit curd, as this is the time of year when all the citrus fruits are at their best. Also, curd can be put to plenty of uses, from topping a steamed fruit pudding, to filling a tart case, to spreading on hot buttered toast. Clementines are a favourite fruit of mine, and while the resulting curd may not have the resulting zing of one made with lemon, it nevertheless has a soft deliciousness all of its own. Mincemeat The blending of spices mixed through dried fruits, even the more mediocre varieties, is one of the more pleasurable jobs in the kitchen and can be done, advisedly, as early on in the winter as possible. It is worth noting that this lovely preserve is a treat to be savoured throughout the whole season, rather than simply at Christmas. A little fruit-filled pastry with a thin slice of spiced butter atop is as delightful in March as it is on Christmas Eve. Technically, it is almost indestructible, but to be on the safe side use it up within six months. 750g apples (Churchill's or Cox's) 400g stoneless raisins 400g currants 150g mixed peel 400g suet 400g sultanas 60g whole almonds \u00bd tsp grated nutmeg \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon \u00bd tsp ground mace 375g muscovado sugar 1 lemon 1 orange 5 tbsp dark rum Peel and finely chop the apples. Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix together. Scrupulously clean and dry some jars, fill them with the mincemeat and seal. Label and date the jars, and store in a cool, dark place. Chocolate biscuit cake 250g plain chocolate 250g unsalted butter 2 very fresh eggs 2 level dssp caster sugar 250g digestive biscuits 1 small handful walnuts 1 heaped tbsp glac\u00e9 cherries 1 tbsp rum Put the chocolate and butter in a bowl and place over a pan of simmering water to melt. Put the eggs and sugar in another bowl, place over simmering water and whisk until pale, thickened and cooked through. Break the biscuits into small pieces, and roughly chop the walnuts and cherries. Combine the chocolate and egg mixture, then add the nuts, cherries and rum. Decant into a lightly buttered tupperware dish, and pop into the fridge to set. For an icing (optional): 60g plain chocolate 1 large tbsp of rum 60g unsalted butter Melt the chocolate with the rum. Cut the butter into small pieces and beat into the chocolate, a little at a time. Pour the icing over the cake swiftly before it sets. Fudge 1kg granulated sugar 125g unsalted butter 200ml fresh milk \u00bd vanilla pod, or 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 tin of condensed milk Put the sugar, butter and milk in a saucepan, then set it over a low heat and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. Pour in the condensed milk and vanilla pod (or extract) and turn up the heat. Boil for 20 minutes or so, then fold back your shirt sleeves and beat the fudge for 10 minutes with a wooden spoon. Under no circumstances do it in a machine. Pour into a lightly oiled tin and leave to set. Cut into squares, and store in an airtight tin. Chocolate fudge Most certainly of another time, one when there was such a thing as a sweetie shop. 290ml water 450g caster sugar 1 large can condensed milk 30g unsalted butter 110g very good dark chocolate \u00bd vanilla pod 1 pinch ground cinnamon (optional, but very good) Scrupulously clean and dry two shallow baking tins. Lightly oil them. Split the vanilla pod and scrape the seeds from within. Put the seeds with the sugar and water in a pot and heat gently, stirring to ensure that the sugar dissolves before the mixture comes to the boil. Add the condensed milk and butter to the pot. Boil, stirring from time to time, until the mixture leaves the side of the pot, or for about 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Melt the chocolate in a bowl over warm water. Stir the melted chocolate into the fudge mix, combine thoroughly, then pour into the tins. Cut the fudge into squares, and leave to set. Cut the set fudge into bite-sized squares, and store in an airtight tin. A good plum chutney Come the deluge of fruit, a good chutney will make a considerable dent in any orchard of plenty. 1.5kg stoned plums 250g sliced onion 50g raisins 250g muscovado sugar 1 level tsp salt 2 cloves 1 big thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated 1 level tsp ground allspice 600ml good red-wine vinegar Place all the ingredients in a large stainless-steel pot and mix. Put the pan over a gentle heat and bring slowly to the boil. Let the brew simmer until it thickens and takes on the consistency of a chutney. (This part of the operation should take about 45 minutes.) Scrupulously clean some jars, fill them with the chutney and seal. A word of warning: don't use metal lids, because these will react with the vinegar. While it is understandable that everyone will be itching for a large spoonful, ideally the chutney should be allowed to mature for four to six weeks. So be patient. Clementine curd Be aware when you are making this preserve that the juice content may vary from fruit to fruit, so a little adjustment in terms of the amount of individual ingredients may be required. Use within a month or so. 12 clementines 220g unsalted butter 500g caster sugar 10 very fresh eggs Carefully grate the zest from the clementines, taking care not to take any of the pith. (For those so inclined, measure some of the sugar in cubes, and use these to 'grate' the zest from the clementines.) Squeeze out the juice from the fruit, then place this, along with the zest and all the other ingredients, in a large bowl and sit it upon a pan of simmering water. Stir from time to time, until the mixture begins to thicken, then stir frequently until the mixture has reached the required curd-like consistency. Have ready some jars, which have been cleaned, dried and warmed, tip the curd into them, then label and date them accordingly. A good spice mix A spice mix that will produce a pot of vegetables, or vegetables and meats, or soup, to soothe even the most jaded Christmas palate and restore comfort and well-being. This is the culinary equivalent of Alka-Seltzer - in other words, its properties are bang on for this time of year. Use within three months. 3 tbsp coriander seeds 8 tsp cumin seeds 2 tsp turmeric 3 blades mace \u00bd stick cinnamon \u00bd nutmeg 3 cloves 8 green cardamom pods 1 tsp fennel seeds \u00bd tsp whole fenugreek 2 tbsp paprika 1 level tsp cayenne pepper Put all the spices in a coffee mill (you'll have to do this in batches), and grind to a powder. Mix well, then divvy up between clean, dry jars, preferably of a darkened hue to protect from light \u0095 Jeremy Lee is the chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.",

Not because they want to be out of the market - for which T+5 would suffice - but because they need readies as soon as the settlement machinery will allow. I find the surge in T+2 deeply worrying. It points to financial calamity for those individuals who were carried away by their investment success at the start of the year who have spent recent months mesmerised by falling share prices, too confused to act. Prices have now fallen so far that they are forced to sell by financial circumstances that were avoidable, if only it had not seemed so easy to make money at the outset. The cool-headed with liquid assets will use this period of panic to build portfolios of the quality tech stocks that have been sold down indiscriminately. But it may be some weeks yet before all the poison is drawn from the market's wound. Edmond Warner is chief executive of Old Mutual Securities edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk",

According to City analysts the latest changes reflect the volatility in the stock market caused by investors fleeing the tech sector after a string of profits warnings from high-profile American companies. FTSE will also make changes to the FTSE Mid 250 index. As things stand, recently floated EasyJet, up 2p to 357.5p yesterday, will join the mid-cap benchmark.",

Guests included Kim Philby, Dusty Springfield and Ronnie and Reggie Kray. When the events outgrew the property, the Krays reputedly suggested what became the fancy dress balls at Porchester Hall.</p> <p>In 1980, Ron opened a new night-spot, Club Travestie Extraordinaire, in Stepney, east London. It rapidly became an east end institution, attracting a devoted crowd of straight cross-dressers, drag queens and admirers. Earlier this year, the club celebrated its 20th anniversary, and is arguably the country's longest-running gay night spot.</p> <p>Until last summer, when he was taken ill, Ron was always on the door, welcoming people in - and almost invariably looking more fabulously dressed than anyone else.

Guests included Kim Philby, Dusty Springfield and Ronnie and Reggie Kray. When the events outgrew the property, the Krays reputedly suggested what became the fancy dress balls at Porchester Hall. In 1980, Ron opened a new night-spot, Club Travestie Extraordinaire, in Stepney, east London. It rapidly became an east end institution, attracting a devoted crowd of straight cross-dressers, drag queens and admirers. Earlier this year, the club celebrated its 20th anniversary, and is arguably the country's longest-running gay night spot. Until last summer, when he was taken ill, Ron was always on the door, welcoming people in - and almost invariably looking more fabulously dressed than anyone else. His partner died in 1981.

      "bodyText": "In an article headed Laugh? I'd like to, page 24 (Opinion), November 25, we said that Ben Elton had \"defected\" to Sky from the BBC \"for the money\", thereby showing \"contempt for the public\" and \"spitting in the face\" of the \"concept of entertainment\". We expressed surprise at the absence of public outcry at Mr Elton's lack of principles. Mr Elton has informed us that he has no contract of any sort with Sky Television, nor has he ever been in negotiation to acquire one. He points this out as a matter of public record while in no way subscribing to the thesis of the article that his working for Sky Television would be an act of hypocrisy deserving bitter public censure. Mr Elton points out that while recognising the legitimacy of the commercial sector he remains an outspoken supporter of the BBC and the principle of public service broadcasting. We apologise to Mr Elton for suggesting otherwise. In a report headed New Express owners set the tone with Beckhams' visit, page 7, November 29, we attributed a quoted remark to \"one veteran at the in-house newsletter, Crusader\". Our media correspondent had simply used the term \"the Crusader\", meaning the paper itself, the Daily Express, and was referring to the crusader device in its masthead. He had no idea that it had an in-house newsletter called the Crusader (a reference inserted in the editing) and that is not where his quote came from. A picture captioned Ian Dury and the Blockheads, page 11, Friday Review, yesterday, in fact showed Ian Dury's first band Kilburn and the High Roads. Tourtour, the mountain village in Provence where Ronald Searle lives, Profile, pages 6 and 7, today's preprinted Saturday Review, styles itself the \"village in the sky\" not the \"village in the clouds\". The Rake's Progress, Searle's tribute to Hogarth, was purchased by the British Museum, not the British Library.

Once again privatisation of public services shows its true colours: directors and shareholders make all the decisions and take all the benefits; the public forks out the money. The only reason that Labour cannot admit this and take Railtrack back into public ownership (having already paid more than the Tories sold it for) is that this would show up its other privatisation schemes for what they are and Prescott would have to go.

The new chairman will have to resign at his first annual general meeting and be elected by the shareholders. If that is not external approval then I don't know what is. The directors should remember that the government owns a \"golden share\" and, as Mrs Thatcher would say, the company is spending \"our money\". RN Barton Twickenham rneilbarton@yahoo.com",

In April, Pfizer, which makes Viagra and has a major research UK base in Kent, announced it was donating its drug fluconazole to the South African government for use in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, a nasty, fatal infection associated with Aids. Cryptococcal meningitis, whose spores are found in bird droppings, is a fungal infection of the membranes of the brain and fluconazole is the only effective drug treatment. The drug must be taken daily for life. Under the Pfizer plan, 100,000 South Africans would receive the drug for free.</p> <p>In the west, fluconazole costs $5,000 a year. Pfzier's donation was worth half a billion dollars. The donation seemed like an act of benevolence. But the effect of it was to maitain Pfzier's worldwide market restricitons on its proprietory brand of fluconazole, marketed under the name of Difulcan. The exact same drug is legally and generically manufactured in Thailand where a daily dose costs US75 cents rather than the $14 pzier charges. The annual cost of treatment in Thailan per patient is $273. Giving the drug to the South African government, under tight restrictions, neutralised its American-based critics, allowed Pfizer to continue to charge the rest of Africa hard cash, and protected its real monopoly at home. \"The issue is not donations, it's sustainable low-cost antiretrovirals. And you can only do that through generic competition,\" says Zackie Achmat, chairman of the South African Aids drugs lobbying group Treatment Action Coalition. \"People are dying here every day. My cousin died last week, one of the guys in our workshop died two days ago. You can see from Thailand that the pills cost practically nothing. Pfizer are donating the pills to avoid a possible court case because of patent abuse. They don't want people in the US and the UK to say, 'Hey, those drugs don't cost as much as you say they do.' \" As part of a Treatment Action Coalition protest, Zackie Achmat personally, but illegally, imported 5,000 doses of the Thai version of fluconazole, distributed them in South Africa for free and then \"confessed\" his crime to the police. It is now eight months on from Pfizer's April press release, but not one single \"free donation\" of fluconazole has reached South African clinics. Pfizer and the South African government are still negotiating the exact terms of the agreement. And Pfizer has no plans to donate fluconazole to Malawi or other sub-Saharan countries. Pfizer is unashamed about its monopolistic marketing techniques. \"We are a drug company and we do need to make a profit. A drug takes 15 years from concept to market. Drug companies need to recoup their investment and research,\" says Jennifer Perry, a Pfizer spokesperson.</p> <p>In Brazil, the government has produced its own generic versions of antiretrovirals; the cost of annual treatment has tumbled from $15,000 to less than $3,000. Some activists claim effective combination drug therapy that stops the virus destroying a patient's immune system could cost as little, on a mass scale, as $200 a year per patient. That's too much for Malawi, but frankly not a lot for the west, which has donated a pittance of its available medical resources to saving Africans from the Aids plague. \"It is obscene that 98-99 per cent of those in the greatest need are denied access to drugs because they cannot afford them,\" said Nathan Ford, a spokesperson with M\u008edecins San Fronti\u008fres, a charity that has lobbied for greater access for Aids drugs in Africa. There is not much left to believe in this world, but we can still, if we want to, believe in our own potential power of goodness. We can, through western governments, through charities, through our will, through political pressure on the economic interests that preserve drug monopolies, try to save some of those in Africa who are plagued by a tiny but deadly piece of RNA. In the hospital courtyard surrounded by the dying, and the living, I asked Christina Mondhali, the HIV-positive nurse on the TB ward, what she wanted. \"I want,\" she said so softly I had to strain to hear, \"to live. I want antiretrovirals. I know it does not heal. But I know it prolongs life.

      "body": "<p>It's 1am on the female medical ward of Nhkotakota Government District Hospital by the shores of Lake Malawi, and Eliza Mwase rises from her bed for a sip of water. Pulled into a sitting position by her aunts, Jane and Patricia, Eliza calls out in Chewa, the local language: \"It hurts, it hurts.\" Tenderly, as if soothing a child, the women repeat her name, \"Eliza, Eliza\", as they lift the cup to her lips. Eliza's hands writhe involuntarily at her wrists, as if they have taken a life of their own and seek to escape their dying host. Eliza coughs, struggling to clear her lungs, and her eyes blaze black, uncomprehending, with pain. As she sips, the water spills over her chin and down her front.</p> <p>Eliza is 21, but she has become a child again. She is three hours from death. A light African rain begins to drum on the ward's tin roof. Two paces from the foot of Eliza's bed, a baby sleeps beside his mother on the concrete floor. Every inch of floor space is covered with patients and their relatives, \"guardians\" who tend their every non-medical need. The dying and living are crowded in here, meshed as one. In the morning, the sun will rise and these sleeping bodies return again to life. But not Eliza. The rains drum on. It is the last sound this child of Africa will ever hear.</p> <p>Eliza Mwase died at 4am that morning, another victim of the Aids epidemic that is tearing its way through Africa. In the west, Aids has become a non-story. Antiretrovirals, drug combination therapies, $15,000 per annum treatment programmes and the disease, if not curable, is at least controllable. Aids has dropped away from the public eye. World Aids Day has become an annual ritual, something that can be marked in a calendar and then forgotten about the following day.</p> <p>But in Africa, Aids is a catastrophe without end, a searing epidemic that has destroyed families, orphaned millions of children, killed the elite and crippled the already impoverished economies of the world's poorest countries. Aids has killed 18.8 million worldwide since the early 80s, but the overwhelming death toll - 16 million - has been in Africa. The United Nations estimates that there are now 34.3 million living with the virus - 24.5 million of those live in sub-Saharan Africa. Millions more, possibly hundreds of millions more, will become infected.</p> <p>In contrast, in Britain there are 31,000 people living with Aids out of a population of 59 million. Among the adult population - which, for the purposes of the UN report, means 15 to 49-year-olds - there is a prevalence rate of 0.11%. There were 450 Aids deaths in the United Kingdom last year. In Germany, the prevalence among adults is 0.10%, and there are 37,000 HIV-positives out of a total population of 82 million, and a 1999 death toll of 600. In the US, the prevalence rate, at 0.61% of the adult population, is higher, but that still gives just a total of 850,000 HIV-positive people of all ages out of a population of 276 million. There were 20,000 Aids deaths in the US last year.</p> <p>Malawi, one of the poorest countries with an annual per capita income of $190, has an official HIV prevalence rate of 16% among the 15-49 age group. The population of Malawi is 10.7m. The total number of people infected with the virus in Malawi, including 40,000 children, is 800,000 - almost the same as in the US. Last year alone, 70,000 Malawians died of Aids. The incubation period for the virus is eight to 10 years; the death toll is accelerating.</p> <p>Malawi is not even at the epicentre of the Aids pandemic. Many other sub-Saharan countries, Botswana (35%), Zimbabwe (25%), Lesotho (23%), Zambia (20%), and Namibia (19%) have higher rates of infectivity among adults. Aids has replaced war, drought, every other disease, including malaria, as the leading cause of death. Demographically, many African societies have become shaped like pyramids; you start out with lots of babies at the base and then taper away like a pyramid as death, disease, mortal happenstance, take its toll until you have a narrow tip of 80-year-olds at the apex. But in Africa, Aids is slicing huge chunks out of the economically productive middle generations as 15 to 49-year-olds succumb to the virus. The pyramid is turning into a narrow chimney. Life expectancy is falling by a decade. A 15-year-old Zimbabwean boy now has a 50% chance of dying of Aids before he is 50. If anything, Malawi is a backward province in the Aids catastrophe, yet the death toll, the devastation of human lives, is awesome.</p> <p>To walk the concrete corridors of Nhkotakota District Hospital is to enter a charnel house of human suffering. Aids is a hydra-headed medical monster that manifests itself in the withered tubercular bodies of the patients. It is there in the suppurating leg ulcers of 35-year-old Mary Mbwana, who is suffering from the skin cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma. It lies deep behind the weeping herpes genital sores of one-time tobacco clerk, 29-year-old William Chimwavi. It is the plague that infects the body of 18-month-old John Phiri, who has, through recurrent bouts of infection, diarrhoea and vomiting, failed to thrive. Three of John's brothers have already died - five-year-old Gift, Romeo, four months, and four-year-old Levinson. It has laid low his mother, Madrind, 35, who suffers from undetermined rashes, infections, wasting and who, too, will soon die like her first husband, Rajab Phiri. Just as Eliza's mother, Frieda Mwase, 42, did. And just as Eliza's father, Thomas Mwase, 49, did earlier this year. As did the four sisters and one brother of Mary Mbwana. And the virus has infected, too, Christina Mondhali, the night nurse still working on the TB ward at Nhkotakota, and the local coffin-maker, Christopher Msowoya.</p> <p>There is no end to this long day of dying.</p> <p>No one dies of Aids in Malawi. Malawians die of a \"short illness\", or they contract an unspecified \"fever\", or they vomit so much they cannot drink. Since 1994, 29 of Malawi's 177 members of parliament have died from \"short illnesses\" - as did the president's brother.</p> <p>In Chewa, Aids is known as \"matantanda athu omwewa\". It means \"this new disease of ours\". Sometimes Aids is also called \"the government disease\", meaning \"this thing we all have in common\". The graveyards are filling and everyone knows someone who has died of Aids, but from fear and superstition, the word is never spoken. Even the medical charts of the sick do not betray the secret. Eliza's charts just read \"fever\" and \"anaemia\".</p> <p>\"Here in Malawi, it's still a shameful disease. If someone dies of Aids, even the churches will say he or she was an adulterer or a prostitute,\" says Christina Mondhali, who is one of few medical professionals in Malawi who is open about her HIV status.</p> <p>Malawi is in denial. Malawi's First Lady, Patricia Shanil Muluzi, may have adopted six Aids orphans. The walls of Malawian brothels may have condom murals. And every Malawian school is visited by \"drama groups\" warning of the dangers of teenage sex. But Aids is talked about in the abstract, not the personal. It is the same across most of southern Africa. Last month, the Alastair Campbell of South Africa, Parks Mankahlana, chief press aide to Nelson Mandela and South African president Thabo Mbeki, died of Aids, even though his widow, Nthabiseng, insisted that he died of \"chronic anaemia\". In a pointed rebuke to his successor, Mandela recently called for the war against Aids in South Africa to become a top priority, clearly referring to Mbeki's strange flirtation with the rejectionist theories of Professor Peter Duesberg, of the University of California, Berkeley, who disputes that Aids is caused by a virus.</p> <p>The denial is counter-productive, but the fear is understandable. Even for the Malawian elite, there is no hope of containing the disease. No one can afford the expensive western antiretrovirals that can stem the virus and save your life. To declare yourself HIV-positive is to live out your death sentence in public. Most Malawians still refuse HIV tests. \"People think it's better not to know. 'You will die from your worries.' They think you do the test and just prepare to die. They think there is no cure for Aids, and it's true,\" said Sam Ndhlovu, a nurse at Nhkotakota.</p> <p>Attitudes are changing, but changing slowly. \"It's not a shameful thing. It's an illness, just the same as malaria or TB. If I hide, I am still going to die with it,\" says Christina Mondhali.</p> <p>In the west, we have, through our medical power, lost all understanding of what plague is. Our experiences of epidemics is restricted to winter flus, colds, medical irritations that carry off the old and the vulnerable. We take a hostile attitude to personalised infection. If you get gonorrhoea, a sexually transmitted disease, you go to the STD clinic, get antibiotics, go home and you might shout at the person who passed on the infection. There is a causal link. And a cure. But in Malawi, the Aids epidemic is everywhere.</p> <p>The first 17 Aids cases were reported in 1985, but the virus was already spreading exponentially throughout the general population. The virus's latent potential, up to a decade between infection and symptoms, masked its spread throughout the population. Aids fatally shadows every sexual encounter, every sexual act, between adult Malawians for the past 20 years. \"It's difficult to say, 'You are the one who gave me the virus,' \" says David Nyirongo, an organiser with the charity ActionAid, who is himself HIV-positive. \"I might have a girlfriend and I might have infected her with the virus. But she might not exactly know it's me. She might have slept with other men. She could have got it from them. She could have given it to me. It's difficult to know the history of anyone. That's why we are unable to point the fingers of suspicion.\"</p> <p>Even those such as Christina Mondhali who can point the finger - her husband gave her herpes when she was four months pregnant with their first child and she later tested HIV-positive - are stoic. \"I do not blame him. And even if I did, what can be done now?\"</p> <p>In Malawi's \"final days\", there is no room for self-pity. \"I am not afraid of dying,\" says David Nyirongo, who married again and has three children with his new wife, Juliana, also HIV-positive. \"I have not yet started suffering. I feel sad every time you hear of the death of someone you know with Aids. I think, 'Tomorrow it's me.' Then I forget. I hope, I dream, we can get the new drugs [antiretrovirals] and start a new life.\"</p> <p>Nhkotakota is not an important town in Malawi. It's a place between other bigger places. It has grown up around an old mission station and nearby Lake Malawi, one of Africa's largest freshwater lakes. There is a petrol station, a line of market stalls, shops, another line of bars/ brothels/resthouses, the A K Paradise Club, the Arizona Special Bottle Store, and the Zabwino Bar. Beyond lies a string of villages, some with mud walls and thatched roofs, others built of brick and corrugated iron, that run into each other before turning to bush. You could drive past in five minutes. Nhkotakota is a dorp, a small unnoticed place in a small unnoticed country in southern Africa.</p> <p>If you turn right at the petrol station and drive a mile off the Tarmac road towards the lake, you'll find Nhkotakota's two hospitals. For some reason, the Government District Hospital was built half a mile away from the old mission hospital of St Ann's. Both hospitals are a jumble of one-storey brick buildings with corrugated roofs. In the back yard of the government hospital is a scatter of broken-down ambulances, their parts cannibalised to service the rest of the decrepit fleet. The outside latrines stink and the sewage runs into the surrounding bush. Recently, a new male medical ward was built at the government hospital, or Boma, as it is known, to relieve the grotesque overcrowding in the main buildings, but the donor funding ran out after the roof went on. The ward sits there forlorn, an empty hulk, waiting for the dying to enter its walls. Across the courtyard, in the main compound, the sick are crowded so tightly against each other that even in the day you must pick your way carefully through the prostrate bodies.</p> <p>The conditions at St Ann's are better, but not that much better. Besides St Ann's is a tree where David Livingstone, the explorer, supposedly met the African chief Jumbe in 1861 and persuaded him to give up the slave trade. The tree has been designated a Malawian National Monument and earns Nhkotakota its only mention in tourist guidebooks. The total population of the outlying Nhkotakota district is around 250,000. There are three doctors for the whole district.</p> <p>Medical treatment in Malawi is theoretically free in government hospitals such as the Boma. The government provides the beds, the drugs and the medical care. Your family, your guardians who sleep on the floor beside your bed, provide the washing, the cleaning, the cooking and the food. But it does not really work out like that. In Malawi, if you are sick, you shop around. If you have money, $10 or maybe $20, you go to a private clinic or a mission hospital such as St Ann's, where the daily costs of being an in-patient are 250 kwacha - about \u00a32 - but the conditions are cleaner, drugs more readily available and the quality of treatment higher. But you need money. We were at St Ann's one morning when an ambulance arrived with a desperately sick man suffering from cerebral malaria - fatal within hours unless treated. He was dying in front of our eyes, but the ambulance was turned away; his family did not have the 250 kwacha for the deposit on the bed for the first day.</p> <p>If you have no money, then there is no choice; you must queue in the morning heat of the Boma's outpatients clinic and hope to be admitted. Demand outstrips supply. There are 130 beds, and every morning another 250 would-be patients appear at the gates. All but the sickest are turned away, as well as the medically hopeless, who are sent back home to die. There is not enough staff, not enough drugs, not enough needles, not enough anything. On one of the days the photographer Gideon Mendel and I were there, the hospital had run out of plasters. After begging the right-sized needle for the child's tiny veins from the nearby mission hospital, staff used cotton wool and a piece of masking tape to bind the drip needle to 18-month-old John Phiri's arm in order to rehydrate him and save his life.</p> <p>There is no hope of change. Malawi is poor and getting poorer. The price of its main export crops - tea and tobacco - is falling. Since last year, the kwacha, has slid downwards against the US dollar, from 43 kwacha to 80, doubling the interest payments on Malawi's international debts. The interest payments on these loans is now one-and-half-times greater than the national health budget.</p> <p>But even if the kwacha was soaring, it would not make any difference. Malawi's hospitals are under siege. Up to 80% of all patients are HIV-positive and have complex, multiple, difficult-to-treat, and ultimately untreatable, infections. The government has an annual health budget of about $10 per capita. Malawi relies on foreign donations to fund its spiralling medical bills. Crucially, for the past two years Malawi has been unable to afford to pay for the reagents used in HIV test kits. There is barely enough reagent to test blood donations. In 1997, even St Ann's mission hospital ran out of money and could not pay its staff for two months.</p> <p>\"We are overwhelmed in every aspect of the epidemic, the lack of equipment, the lack of staff, all angles. We have been engulfed by the problem,\" says Dr Maurice Bonongwe, Nhkotakota District Hospital's sole physician. Every one of those 800,000 Malawian citizens who are HIV-positive, just like every one of the 24.5 million sub-Saharan Africans with the virus, is going to die of Aids unless the west intervenes.</p> <p>We found Eliza again, wrapped in a sheet and lying on the floor of a mud-walled hut in her grandfather's village, Selemani 2, on the shore of Lake Malawi, about 10 miles from the hospital. She had gone home on the metal floor of the government ambulance/hearse. The hospital morgue, like the hospital, is tight for space; by 8am there was another patient in the same bed. The hut was lit by a paraffin lamp and in death Eliza seemed impossibly small, a girl-child. Selemani 2 is a beautiful place; fishermen's boats ride the freshwater swell and the shore is dotted with the blood-red blossom fallen from bougainvillea trees.</p> <p>Eliza had come back here in early October, to her grandfather's house, after she grew too sick to be in the city. But Eliza just got sicker and sicker. She had been living in Mzuzu, a town 300km away, with her parents, and then the catastrophe struck. In 1998, her mother Frieda, 42, grew sick and died and then her father Thomas, 49, died earlier this year. Eliza, her family said, was a schoolgirl even though she was 21. That's not uncommon in Malawi, where pupils often drop out for a year or two as the family saves to pay school fees. Someone else said Eliza had worked in bars. Even as she was dying, you could see that she had been beautiful.</p> <p>Like most societies, Malawians are hypocritical about sex. Malawi is a religious country. Open homosexuality is still a cultural taboo. Intravenous drug misuse is virtually unknown. Families go to church, listen to sermons, believe in God, chastity, the Ten Commandments, and then the men go to bars at the weekend and sleep with prostitutes. Malawi is poor, the workforce unskilled, there is a lot of unemployment; unsupported women are at the bottom of the economic heap. Sex is cheap, 250 kwacha - about \u00a32 - for a brief session. Prostitution is casual, semi-open, and culturally acceptable. Until recently, most Malawian men did not want to use condoms; there were 500,000 cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in 1998; 70% of prostitutes test positive; 50% of men attending STD clinics also test positive. After the weekend, the men go back and have unprotected sex with their wives. The virus spreads.</p> <p>Changing private sexual behaviours is incredibly difficult. Since the 60s, the British government, rich and infinitely powerful by Malawian standards, has bombarded its citizens with propaganda about contraception and the follies of teenage pregnancy. Hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent on advice centres, public education campaigns, free contraceptives. After 30 years, Britain still has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Western Europe.</p> <p>Iasked Dr Bonongwe if, in the midst of all this death, he was confident that Malawians would change and practise safer sex. He paused for a moment, as if searching for a complex answer: \"No, I don't think so. There is no prospect that people will change their behaviour. We advocate the use of condoms, but the churches do not support the use of condoms,\" he said with a sad finality. \"I expect many, many people over the next 10 years to die. For those who have been sexually active, it's a disaster. Only the children, those aged five to 15, who we are cherishing as a future, will survive.\" Children make up a large proportion of the Malawian population and, despite the danger of HIV-positive mothers passing on the disease to their babies, so far the infection rate among those 14 and under is a fraction of that among the adult population.</p> <p>Culturally, Malawians are accustomed to straight vaginal sex. But there seem to be some crucial differences in the way the virus infects men and women. Women are more easily infected. And women get infected younger because men tend to sleep with younger women and can use their greater economic power to buy sex. But it all evens out in the end. The older you are, the shorter the time span between infection and death; sugar daddies die, too.</p> <p>Eliza's family were poor, poor beyond our imagining. Malawian funerals are great public events. The entire village gathers to spend the night at the house of the deceased. Songs are sung; Jesus is praised, the Devil is condemned. The songs go on all night long. The mourners must be fed, the food cooked, and firewood gathered. Funerals are expensive. The price of her coffin - 2,400 kwacha, about \u00a320 - was beyond them. We gave a little money and a lift to the coffin-maker back into town. Business is brisk in the Malawian coffin trade. In a good week, Christopher Moswoya, one of two coffin-makers in the town, takes orders for 10-12 coffins. They come in three sizes; standard, middle, small. But Christopher was not planning to expand; he was also sick with the virus. As he sanded and varnished Eliza's coffin, we fell into conversation. The coffin trade in Malawi was a good business, but life would be easier if he could afford power tools. Without those tools, he had to saw tree trunks by hand. It was arm-breaking work. \"If I got sick, I could still work. You just press the button and it goes.\" But the price of power tools, like the price of western antiretrovirals, was beyond his reach.</p> <p>Christopher wanted to know about the drugs, too. He wanted to know why western drug companies charged so much. \"So, are they after business?\" he asked shyly, not sure if these white foreigners before him were somehow connected to the drug trade. \"The World Health Organisation, what is it doing to help people? I think that is a big organisation for the whole world. They should do something to control the price, or to put in a certain amount of money so that the drugs become cheaper. You've seen how people are dying in Malawi. It's a big pity.\"</p> <p>Aids is economically ruinous. In a corner of the female ward at St Ann's lies Mary Mbwana. Mary, 35, twice married, is heavy, solidly built, but she, too, is in the final throes of the illness. Her sallow flesh is blotted and scarred with Kaposi's sarcoma. The disfiguring black-brown tumours under her skin run across her face, around her mouth, across her back and breasts. Her flesh has burst open at the thigh. There is a dinner plate-sized wound. She is running a fever, wallowing in pain, struggling in the last hours of life. Her \"guardian\", her aged mother Miriam, sits by her bed and drives the flies away that gather on the vomit-smeared sheets. Everyone knows Mary will die soon. There is no more hope for Mary than there was for her sisters Jessie, 42, Irene, 48, Agatha, 35, Dorothy, 52, and her brother Lawrence, 51, who all died from the virus last year. Mary will be the sixth sibling, out of a family of 11, to die of Aids. Miriam is now a mother again to her 28 grandchildren, all orphaned, and none older than 15.</p> <p>The Mbwanas, never rich but once moderately prosperous by Malawi's meagre standards, are destitute. Whatever resources the family had have all been lost by the futile succession of medical bills, and then the coffins and funeral meals. Irene's husband is dead, Dorothy's \"passed away\" last year, the others are already weakening. Mary's husband is an ill man. There is no one left to pay the children's school fees, no one left to earn the money to buy the maize porridge to feed such a huge brood of children.</p> <p>The extended family, the great support mechanism of Africa, is shattered. The family's fortunes have fallen so far that Mary is trapped in the hospital. To be discharged, even to go home to die, you must pay your medical bills. Mary owes 1,600 kwacha , about \u00a313. The family do not have the money and so the medical bills mount. And Miriam and her eldest daughter, Georgina, wait for the inevitable.</p> <p>\"My sisters were very beautiful, and now they are all gone, \" explains Georgina. \"How can I feel when I see their houses, all three in a row, all empty. I used to be able to say 'do this for me, do that'. At that time, all of these were alive and so could easily contribute. But this time mum is alone, I am alone. These are the ones looking after the family. It's very difficult. If sometimes food is small, mum just gives to the children and sleeps without food. I also have nine children. And now I have nobody. This time I am helping Mary, and Mary will not help me back. So this is really powerful. And mum will have no one to look after her.\"</p> <p>But Mary is not the end of Georgina's troubles. Back in the children's ward of the district hospital, John Phiri, Georgina's 18-month-old grandson, is running another fever. He is vomiting, he has diarrhoea. He is fatally dehydrating. He lies listless in the listless arms of his mother, 35-year-old Madrind, Georgina's mother. Madrind is herself sick with the virus. She scratches at the rash that runs from her feet to her chest. Her limbs are withered and her eyes utterly defeated. Madrind is John's \"guardian\", but she is so weak she can barely look after herself. Sometimes her second husband, Karimi Phiri, comes to support her and sometimes he does not. Three of Madrind's five children have already died, as John will soon. Only her oldest boy, six-year-old Alinafe - whose name, ironically, means \"God is with us\" in Chewa - will possibly survive.</p> <p>\"Madrind is beyond sad,\" says Georgina. \"She is defeated. She knows she is going to die. She will not survive this, nor will John. She has the same rashes as her first husband, who passed away. They are exactly the same kind of rashes he was asking her to scratch. She is lonely, very lonely.\"</p> <p>Back in Selemani 2, just before dawn, a barefoot squad of grave-diggers went down to the lakeshore to the dig Eliza's grave in the orange African earth. The singing never stopped and then sermons and speeches were given. They carried Eliza down to her final resting place on a succession of hands held at waist level, the pallbearers peeling off from the back of the coffin and rejoining at the front, to make a never ceasing human stream.</p> <p>It was a long day in the African sun, and by the time we returned to the hospital, Mary Mbwana was dead. A year before, she had fought off tuberculosis. But there was no escape from the virus. Her funeral began that evening. The mourners danced all night around her empty coffin, they sang their hearts out. They sang, too, in the mortuary the next morning as the women unwrapped Mary from her winding sheet and washed and dressed her body for the grave. Mary was so disfigured by her facial tumours that the coffin, contrary to tradition, had to remain closed. There was no final viewing, no \"final face\". But nothing broke the rhythm of these women's singing apart from a moment as they left the mortuary. From outside came another sound, the high-pitched cry of other women keening; another dead patient, another funeral party, had arrived at the mortuary.</p> <p>Mary's relatives took her home in the brown coffin, singing all the way as they passed through town. Later on, there were three-hour long soaring sermons in the blasting sun. No one mentioned Aids.</p> <p>Viruses are strings of genetic material. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is composed of ribonucleic acid (RNA), a line of basic amino acids, CCs, UUs, AAs and GGs. It was not the HIV virus directly that killed Eliza Mwase; it infected her T-helper cells with its own genetic code. It turned Mary Mbwana's own CD4 lymphocytes into viral replication machines that produced more copies of its own genetic code and infected more CD4 lymphocytes and broke down her immune system. And then other opportunistic organisms, bacteria, other viruses, mutations, killed her.</p> <p>The virus has replicated millions of counterfeit but immunologically useless copies of John Phiri's CD4 lymphocytes and stripped him of his ability to resist commonplace infections. The HIV virus blindly wreaks havoc, but it is just a genetic copying machine.</p> <p>We could, in the west, try and put a stop it. To do nothing is to turn our hearts away, shut our ears to the soft words of despair, and wait to listen in silence to the sound of African keening. What should be done? There is not an easy answer. Africa is not another suburb of Europe. The infrastructure is poor, roads, schools, hospitals are, in places, rudimentary; life is harsher. But that is not why people are dying of Aids in Africa. They are dying because they are being denied access to the drugs that could treat their opportunistic infections, and the antiretrovirals that would stop that piece of genetic material - HIV - from replicating inside their bodies.</p> <p>The patent rights on the drugs that could save them are owned by large western pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Glaxo-Wellcome, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and Hoffman-La Roche. These companies are powerful economic interests, with widespread political influence. They are supported by western governments such as Britain and the United States, as well as the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation, the United Nations, the World Health Organisation, even UNAIDS, the Aids arm of United Nations. These companies, and their tied political interests, are all part of the \"international community\" that is intensely concerned about Aids in Africa - but not quite concerned enough to do anything significant about it. <br><br><a href=\"http://guardian-dev.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,405534,00.html\">Aids story: part 2</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It's 1am on the female medical ward of Nhkotakota Government District Hospital by the shores of Lake Malawi, and Eliza Mwase rises from her bed for a sip of water. Pulled into a sitting position by her aunts, Jane and Patricia, Eliza calls out in Chewa, the local language: \"It hurts, it hurts.\" Tenderly, as if soothing a child, the women repeat her name, \"Eliza, Eliza\", as they lift the cup to her lips. Eliza's hands writhe involuntarily at her wrists, as if they have taken a life of their own and seek to escape their dying host. Eliza coughs, struggling to clear her lungs, and her eyes blaze black, uncomprehending, with pain. As she sips, the water spills over her chin and down her front. Eliza is 21, but she has become a child again. She is three hours from death. A light African rain begins to drum on the ward's tin roof. Two paces from the foot of Eliza's bed, a baby sleeps beside his mother on the concrete floor. Every inch of floor space is covered with patients and their relatives, \"guardians\" who tend their every non-medical need. The dying and living are crowded in here, meshed as one. In the morning, the sun will rise and these sleeping bodies return again to life. But not Eliza. The rains drum on. It is the last sound this child of Africa will ever hear. Eliza Mwase died at 4am that morning, another victim of the Aids epidemic that is tearing its way through Africa. In the west, Aids has become a non-story. Antiretrovirals, drug combination therapies, $15,000 per annum treatment programmes and the disease, if not curable, is at least controllable. Aids has dropped away from the public eye. World Aids Day has become an annual ritual, something that can be marked in a calendar and then forgotten about the following day. But in Africa, Aids is a catastrophe without end, a searing epidemic that has destroyed families, orphaned millions of children, killed the elite and crippled the already impoverished economies of the world's poorest countries. Aids has killed 18.8 million worldwide since the early 80s, but the overwhelming death toll - 16 million - has been in Africa. The United Nations estimates that there are now 34.3 million living with the virus - 24.5 million of those live in sub-Saharan Africa. Millions more, possibly hundreds of millions more, will become infected. In contrast, in Britain there are 31,000 people living with Aids out of a population of 59 million. Among the adult population - which, for the purposes of the UN report, means 15 to 49-year-olds - there is a prevalence rate of 0.11%. There were 450 Aids deaths in the United Kingdom last year. In Germany, the prevalence among adults is 0.10%, and there are 37,000 HIV-positives out of a total population of 82 million, and a 1999 death toll of 600. In the US, the prevalence rate, at 0.61% of the adult population, is higher, but that still gives just a total of 850,000 HIV-positive people of all ages out of a population of 276 million. There were 20,000 Aids deaths in the US last year. Malawi, one of the poorest countries with an annual per capita income of $190, has an official HIV prevalence rate of 16% among the 15-49 age group. The population of Malawi is 10.7m. The total number of people infected with the virus in Malawi, including 40,000 children, is 800,000 - almost the same as in the US. Last year alone, 70,000 Malawians died of Aids. The incubation period for the virus is eight to 10 years; the death toll is accelerating. Malawi is not even at the epicentre of the Aids pandemic. Many other sub-Saharan countries, Botswana (35%), Zimbabwe (25%), Lesotho (23%), Zambia (20%), and Namibia (19%) have higher rates of infectivity among adults. Aids has replaced war, drought, every other disease, including malaria, as the leading cause of death. Demographically, many African societies have become shaped like pyramids; you start out with lots of babies at the base and then taper away like a pyramid as death, disease, mortal happenstance, take its toll until you have a narrow tip of 80-year-olds at the apex. But in Africa, Aids is slicing huge chunks out of the economically productive middle generations as 15 to 49-year-olds succumb to the virus. The pyramid is turning into a narrow chimney. Life expectancy is falling by a decade. A 15-year-old Zimbabwean boy now has a 50% chance of dying of Aids before he is 50. If anything, Malawi is a backward province in the Aids catastrophe, yet the death toll, the devastation of human lives, is awesome. To walk the concrete corridors of Nhkotakota District Hospital is to enter a charnel house of human suffering. Aids is a hydra-headed medical monster that manifests itself in the withered tubercular bodies of the patients. It is there in the suppurating leg ulcers of 35-year-old Mary Mbwana, who is suffering from the skin cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma. It lies deep behind the weeping herpes genital sores of one-time tobacco clerk, 29-year-old William Chimwavi. It is the plague that infects the body of 18-month-old John Phiri, who has, through recurrent bouts of infection, diarrhoea and vomiting, failed to thrive. Three of John's brothers have already died - five-year-old Gift, Romeo, four months, and four-year-old Levinson. It has laid low his mother, Madrind, 35, who suffers from undetermined rashes, infections, wasting and who, too, will soon die like her first husband, Rajab Phiri. Just as Eliza's mother, Frieda Mwase, 42, did. And just as Eliza's father, Thomas Mwase, 49, did earlier this year. As did the four sisters and one brother of Mary Mbwana. And the virus has infected, too, Christina Mondhali, the night nurse still working on the TB ward at Nhkotakota, and the local coffin-maker, Christopher Msowoya. There is no end to this long day of dying. No one dies of Aids in Malawi. Malawians die of a \"short illness\", or they contract an unspecified \"fever\", or they vomit so much they cannot drink. Since 1994, 29 of Malawi's 177 members of parliament have died from \"short illnesses\" - as did the president's brother. In Chewa, Aids is known as \"matantanda athu omwewa\". It means \"this new disease of ours\". Sometimes Aids is also called \"the government disease\", meaning \"this thing we all have in common\". The graveyards are filling and everyone knows someone who has died of Aids, but from fear and superstition, the word is never spoken. Even the medical charts of the sick do not betray the secret. Eliza's charts just read \"fever\" and \"anaemia\". \"Here in Malawi, it's still a shameful disease. If someone dies of Aids, even the churches will say he or she was an adulterer or a prostitute,\" says Christina Mondhali, who is one of few medical professionals in Malawi who is open about her HIV status. Malawi is in denial. Malawi's First Lady, Patricia Shanil Muluzi, may have adopted six Aids orphans. The walls of Malawian brothels may have condom murals. And every Malawian school is visited by \"drama groups\" warning of the dangers of teenage sex. But Aids is talked about in the abstract, not the personal. It is the same across most of southern Africa. Last month, the Alastair Campbell of South Africa, Parks Mankahlana, chief press aide to Nelson Mandela and South African president Thabo Mbeki, died of Aids, even though his widow, Nthabiseng, insisted that he died of \"chronic anaemia\". In a pointed rebuke to his successor, Mandela recently called for the war against Aids in South Africa to become a top priority, clearly referring to Mbeki's strange flirtation with the rejectionist theories of Professor Peter Duesberg, of the University of California, Berkeley, who disputes that Aids is caused by a virus. The denial is counter-productive, but the fear is understandable. Even for the Malawian elite, there is no hope of containing the disease. No one can afford the expensive western antiretrovirals that can stem the virus and save your life. To declare yourself HIV-positive is to live out your death sentence in public. Most Malawians still refuse HIV tests. \"People think it's better not to know. 'You will die from your worries.' They think you do the test and just prepare to die. They think there is no cure for Aids, and it's true,\" said Sam Ndhlovu, a nurse at Nhkotakota. Attitudes are changing, but changing slowly. \"It's not a shameful thing. It's an illness, just the same as malaria or TB. If I hide, I am still going to die with it,\" says Christina Mondhali. In the west, we have, through our medical power, lost all understanding of what plague is. Our experiences of epidemics is restricted to winter flus, colds, medical irritations that carry off the old and the vulnerable. We take a hostile attitude to personalised infection. If you get gonorrhoea, a sexually transmitted disease, you go to the STD clinic, get antibiotics, go home and you might shout at the person who passed on the infection. There is a causal link. And a cure. But in Malawi, the Aids epidemic is everywhere. The first 17 Aids cases were reported in 1985, but the virus was already spreading exponentially throughout the general population. The virus's latent potential, up to a decade between infection and symptoms, masked its spread throughout the population. Aids fatally shadows every sexual encounter, every sexual act, between adult Malawians for the past 20 years. \"It's difficult to say, 'You are the one who gave me the virus,' \" says David Nyirongo, an organiser with the charity ActionAid, who is himself HIV-positive. \"I might have a girlfriend and I might have infected her with the virus. But she might not exactly know it's me. She might have slept with other men. She could have got it from them. She could have given it to me. It's difficult to know the history of anyone. That's why we are unable to point the fingers of suspicion.\" Even those such as Christina Mondhali who can point the finger - her husband gave her herpes when she was four months pregnant with their first child and she later tested HIV-positive - are stoic. \"I do not blame him. And even if I did, what can be done now?\" In Malawi's \"final days\", there is no room for self-pity. \"I am not afraid of dying,\" says David Nyirongo, who married again and has three children with his new wife, Juliana, also HIV-positive. \"I have not yet started suffering. I feel sad every time you hear of the death of someone you know with Aids. I think, 'Tomorrow it's me.' Then I forget. I hope, I dream, we can get the new drugs [antiretrovirals] and start a new life.\" Nhkotakota is not an important town in Malawi. It's a place between other bigger places. It has grown up around an old mission station and nearby Lake Malawi, one of Africa's largest freshwater lakes. There is a petrol station, a line of market stalls, shops, another line of bars/ brothels/resthouses, the A K Paradise Club, the Arizona Special Bottle Store, and the Zabwino Bar. Beyond lies a string of villages, some with mud walls and thatched roofs, others built of brick and corrugated iron, that run into each other before turning to bush. You could drive past in five minutes. Nhkotakota is a dorp, a small unnoticed place in a small unnoticed country in southern Africa. If you turn right at the petrol station and drive a mile off the Tarmac road towards the lake, you'll find Nhkotakota's two hospitals. For some reason, the Government District Hospital was built half a mile away from the old mission hospital of St Ann's. Both hospitals are a jumble of one-storey brick buildings with corrugated roofs. In the back yard of the government hospital is a scatter of broken-down ambulances, their parts cannibalised to service the rest of the decrepit fleet. The outside latrines stink and the sewage runs into the surrounding bush. Recently, a new male medical ward was built at the government hospital, or Boma, as it is known, to relieve the grotesque overcrowding in the main buildings, but the donor funding ran out after the roof went on. The ward sits there forlorn, an empty hulk, waiting for the dying to enter its walls. Across the courtyard, in the main compound, the sick are crowded so tightly against each other that even in the day you must pick your way carefully through the prostrate bodies. The conditions at St Ann's are better, but not that much better. Besides St Ann's is a tree where David Livingstone, the explorer, supposedly met the African chief Jumbe in 1861 and persuaded him to give up the slave trade. The tree has been designated a Malawian National Monument and earns Nhkotakota its only mention in tourist guidebooks. The total population of the outlying Nhkotakota district is around 250,000. There are three doctors for the whole district. Medical treatment in Malawi is theoretically free in government hospitals such as the Boma. The government provides the beds, the drugs and the medical care. Your family, your guardians who sleep on the floor beside your bed, provide the washing, the cleaning, the cooking and the food. But it does not really work out like that. In Malawi, if you are sick, you shop around. If you have money, $10 or maybe $20, you go to a private clinic or a mission hospital such as St Ann's, where the daily costs of being an in-patient are 250 kwacha - about \u00a32 - but the conditions are cleaner, drugs more readily available and the quality of treatment higher. But you need money. We were at St Ann's one morning when an ambulance arrived with a desperately sick man suffering from cerebral malaria - fatal within hours unless treated. He was dying in front of our eyes, but the ambulance was turned away; his family did not have the 250 kwacha for the deposit on the bed for the first day. If you have no money, then there is no choice; you must queue in the morning heat of the Boma's outpatients clinic and hope to be admitted. Demand outstrips supply. There are 130 beds, and every morning another 250 would-be patients appear at the gates. All but the sickest are turned away, as well as the medically hopeless, who are sent back home to die. There is not enough staff, not enough drugs, not enough needles, not enough anything. On one of the days the photographer Gideon Mendel and I were there, the hospital had run out of plasters. After begging the right-sized needle for the child's tiny veins from the nearby mission hospital, staff used cotton wool and a piece of masking tape to bind the drip needle to 18-month-old John Phiri's arm in order to rehydrate him and save his life. There is no hope of change. Malawi is poor and getting poorer. The price of its main export crops - tea and tobacco - is falling. Since last year, the kwacha, has slid downwards against the US dollar, from 43 kwacha to 80, doubling the interest payments on Malawi's international debts. The interest payments on these loans is now one-and-half-times greater than the national health budget. But even if the kwacha was soaring, it would not make any difference. Malawi's hospitals are under siege. Up to 80% of all patients are HIV-positive and have complex, multiple, difficult-to-treat, and ultimately untreatable, infections. The government has an annual health budget of about $10 per capita. Malawi relies on foreign donations to fund its spiralling medical bills. Crucially, for the past two years Malawi has been unable to afford to pay for the reagents used in HIV test kits. There is barely enough reagent to test blood donations. In 1997, even St Ann's mission hospital ran out of money and could not pay its staff for two months. \"We are overwhelmed in every aspect of the epidemic, the lack of equipment, the lack of staff, all angles. We have been engulfed by the problem,\" says Dr Maurice Bonongwe, Nhkotakota District Hospital's sole physician. Every one of those 800,000 Malawian citizens who are HIV-positive, just like every one of the 24.5 million sub-Saharan Africans with the virus, is going to die of Aids unless the west intervenes. We found Eliza again, wrapped in a sheet and lying on the floor of a mud-walled hut in her grandfather's village, Selemani 2, on the shore of Lake Malawi, about 10 miles from the hospital. She had gone home on the metal floor of the government ambulance/hearse. The hospital morgue, like the hospital, is tight for space; by 8am there was another patient in the same bed. The hut was lit by a paraffin lamp and in death Eliza seemed impossibly small, a girl-child. Selemani 2 is a beautiful place; fishermen's boats ride the freshwater swell and the shore is dotted with the blood-red blossom fallen from bougainvillea trees. Eliza had come back here in early October, to her grandfather's house, after she grew too sick to be in the city. But Eliza just got sicker and sicker. She had been living in Mzuzu, a town 300km away, with her parents, and then the catastrophe struck. In 1998, her mother Frieda, 42, grew sick and died and then her father Thomas, 49, died earlier this year. Eliza, her family said, was a schoolgirl even though she was 21. That's not uncommon in Malawi, where pupils often drop out for a year or two as the family saves to pay school fees. Someone else said Eliza had worked in bars. Even as she was dying, you could see that she had been beautiful. Like most societies, Malawians are hypocritical about sex. Malawi is a religious country. Open homosexuality is still a cultural taboo. Intravenous drug misuse is virtually unknown. Families go to church, listen to sermons, believe in God, chastity, the Ten Commandments, and then the men go to bars at the weekend and sleep with prostitutes. Malawi is poor, the workforce unskilled, there is a lot of unemployment; unsupported women are at the bottom of the economic heap. Sex is cheap, 250 kwacha - about \u00a32 - for a brief session. Prostitution is casual, semi-open, and culturally acceptable. Until recently, most Malawian men did not want to use condoms; there were 500,000 cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in 1998; 70% of prostitutes test positive; 50% of men attending STD clinics also test positive. After the weekend, the men go back and have unprotected sex with their wives. The virus spreads. Changing private sexual behaviours is incredibly difficult. Since the 60s, the British government, rich and infinitely powerful by Malawian standards, has bombarded its citizens with propaganda about contraception and the follies of teenage pregnancy. Hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent on advice centres, public education campaigns, free contraceptives. After 30 years, Britain still has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Western Europe. Iasked Dr Bonongwe if, in the midst of all this death, he was confident that Malawians would change and practise safer sex. He paused for a moment, as if searching for a complex answer: \"No, I don't think so. There is no prospect that people will change their behaviour. We advocate the use of condoms, but the churches do not support the use of condoms,\" he said with a sad finality. \"I expect many, many people over the next 10 years to die. For those who have been sexually active, it's a disaster. Only the children, those aged five to 15, who we are cherishing as a future, will survive.\" Children make up a large proportion of the Malawian population and, despite the danger of HIV-positive mothers passing on the disease to their babies, so far the infection rate among those 14 and under is a fraction of that among the adult population. Culturally, Malawians are accustomed to straight vaginal sex. But there seem to be some crucial differences in the way the virus infects men and women. Women are more easily infected. And women get infected younger because men tend to sleep with younger women and can use their greater economic power to buy sex. But it all evens out in the end. The older you are, the shorter the time span between infection and death; sugar daddies die, too. Eliza's family were poor, poor beyond our imagining. Malawian funerals are great public events. The entire village gathers to spend the night at the house of the deceased. Songs are sung; Jesus is praised, the Devil is condemned. The songs go on all night long. The mourners must be fed, the food cooked, and firewood gathered. Funerals are expensive. The price of her coffin - 2,400 kwacha, about \u00a320 - was beyond them. We gave a little money and a lift to the coffin-maker back into town. Business is brisk in the Malawian coffin trade. In a good week, Christopher Moswoya, one of two coffin-makers in the town, takes orders for 10-12 coffins. They come in three sizes; standard, middle, small. But Christopher was not planning to expand; he was also sick with the virus. As he sanded and varnished Eliza's coffin, we fell into conversation. The coffin trade in Malawi was a good business, but life would be easier if he could afford power tools. Without those tools, he had to saw tree trunks by hand. It was arm-breaking work. \"If I got sick, I could still work. You just press the button and it goes.\" But the price of power tools, like the price of western antiretrovirals, was beyond his reach. Christopher wanted to know about the drugs, too. He wanted to know why western drug companies charged so much. \"So, are they after business?\" he asked shyly, not sure if these white foreigners before him were somehow connected to the drug trade. \"The World Health Organisation, what is it doing to help people? I think that is a big organisation for the whole world. They should do something to control the price, or to put in a certain amount of money so that the drugs become cheaper. You've seen how people are dying in Malawi. It's a big pity.\" Aids is economically ruinous. In a corner of the female ward at St Ann's lies Mary Mbwana. Mary, 35, twice married, is heavy, solidly built, but she, too, is in the final throes of the illness. Her sallow flesh is blotted and scarred with Kaposi's sarcoma. The disfiguring black-brown tumours under her skin run across her face, around her mouth, across her back and breasts. Her flesh has burst open at the thigh. There is a dinner plate-sized wound. She is running a fever, wallowing in pain, struggling in the last hours of life. Her \"guardian\", her aged mother Miriam, sits by her bed and drives the flies away that gather on the vomit-smeared sheets. Everyone knows Mary will die soon. There is no more hope for Mary than there was for her sisters Jessie, 42, Irene, 48, Agatha, 35, Dorothy, 52, and her brother Lawrence, 51, who all died from the virus last year. Mary will be the sixth sibling, out of a family of 11, to die of Aids. Miriam is now a mother again to her 28 grandchildren, all orphaned, and none older than 15. The Mbwanas, never rich but once moderately prosperous by Malawi's meagre standards, are destitute. Whatever resources the family had have all been lost by the futile succession of medical bills, and then the coffins and funeral meals. Irene's husband is dead, Dorothy's \"passed away\" last year, the others are already weakening. Mary's husband is an ill man. There is no one left to pay the children's school fees, no one left to earn the money to buy the maize porridge to feed such a huge brood of children. The extended family, the great support mechanism of Africa, is shattered. The family's fortunes have fallen so far that Mary is trapped in the hospital. To be discharged, even to go home to die, you must pay your medical bills. Mary owes 1,600 kwacha , about \u00a313. The family do not have the money and so the medical bills mount. And Miriam and her eldest daughter, Georgina, wait for the inevitable. \"My sisters were very beautiful, and now they are all gone, \" explains Georgina. \"How can I feel when I see their houses, all three in a row, all empty. I used to be able to say 'do this for me, do that'. At that time, all of these were alive and so could easily contribute. But this time mum is alone, I am alone. These are the ones looking after the family. It's very difficult. If sometimes food is small, mum just gives to the children and sleeps without food. I also have nine children. And now I have nobody. This time I am helping Mary, and Mary will not help me back. So this is really powerful. And mum will have no one to look after her.\" But Mary is not the end of Georgina's troubles. Back in the children's ward of the district hospital, John Phiri, Georgina's 18-month-old grandson, is running another fever. He is vomiting, he has diarrhoea. He is fatally dehydrating. He lies listless in the listless arms of his mother, 35-year-old Madrind, Georgina's mother. Madrind is herself sick with the virus. She scratches at the rash that runs from her feet to her chest. Her limbs are withered and her eyes utterly defeated. Madrind is John's \"guardian\", but she is so weak she can barely look after herself. Sometimes her second husband, Karimi Phiri, comes to support her and sometimes he does not. Three of Madrind's five children have already died, as John will soon. Only her oldest boy, six-year-old Alinafe - whose name, ironically, means \"God is with us\" in Chewa - will possibly survive. \"Madrind is beyond sad,\" says Georgina. \"She is defeated. She knows she is going to die. She will not survive this, nor will John. She has the same rashes as her first husband, who passed away. They are exactly the same kind of rashes he was asking her to scratch. She is lonely, very lonely.\" Back in Selemani 2, just before dawn, a barefoot squad of grave-diggers went down to the lakeshore to the dig Eliza's grave in the orange African earth. The singing never stopped and then sermons and speeches were given. They carried Eliza down to her final resting place on a succession of hands held at waist level, the pallbearers peeling off from the back of the coffin and rejoining at the front, to make a never ceasing human stream. It was a long day in the African sun, and by the time we returned to the hospital, Mary Mbwana was dead. A year before, she had fought off tuberculosis. But there was no escape from the virus. Her funeral began that evening. The mourners danced all night around her empty coffin, they sang their hearts out. They sang, too, in the mortuary the next morning as the women unwrapped Mary from her winding sheet and washed and dressed her body for the grave. Mary was so disfigured by her facial tumours that the coffin, contrary to tradition, had to remain closed. There was no final viewing, no \"final face\". But nothing broke the rhythm of these women's singing apart from a moment as they left the mortuary. From outside came another sound, the high-pitched cry of other women keening; another dead patient, another funeral party, had arrived at the mortuary. Mary's relatives took her home in the brown coffin, singing all the way as they passed through town. Later on, there were three-hour long soaring sermons in the blasting sun. No one mentioned Aids. Viruses are strings of genetic material. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is composed of ribonucleic acid (RNA), a line of basic amino acids, CCs, UUs, AAs and GGs. It was not the HIV virus directly that killed Eliza Mwase; it infected her T-helper cells with its own genetic code. It turned Mary Mbwana's own CD4 lymphocytes into viral replication machines that produced more copies of its own genetic code and infected more CD4 lymphocytes and broke down her immune system. And then other opportunistic organisms, bacteria, other viruses, mutations, killed her. The virus has replicated millions of counterfeit but immunologically useless copies of John Phiri's CD4 lymphocytes and stripped him of his ability to resist commonplace infections. The HIV virus blindly wreaks havoc, but it is just a genetic copying machine. We could, in the west, try and put a stop it. To do nothing is to turn our hearts away, shut our ears to the soft words of despair, and wait to listen in silence to the sound of African keening. What should be done? There is not an easy answer. Africa is not another suburb of Europe. The infrastructure is poor, roads, schools, hospitals are, in places, rudimentary; life is harsher. But that is not why people are dying of Aids in Africa. They are dying because they are being denied access to the drugs that could treat their opportunistic infections, and the antiretrovirals that would stop that piece of genetic material - HIV - from replicating inside their bodies. The patent rights on the drugs that could save them are owned by large western pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Glaxo-Wellcome, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and Hoffman-La Roche. These companies are powerful economic interests, with widespread political influence. They are supported by western governments such as Britain and the United States, as well as the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation, the United Nations, the World Health Organisation, even UNAIDS, the Aids arm of United Nations. These companies, and their tied political interests, are all part of the \"international community\" that is intensely concerned about Aids in Africa - but not quite concerned enough to do anything significant about it.

The sun definitely has something to do with this state of affairs, and the plus point is that the Spaniards don't have boy band singers as heroes - they have 17-year-old bullfighters who all look like Ricky Martin, only better. You can see the attraction. In one sense, bullfights are a very macho affair. If you kill the bull badly (that is, if the final sword thrust to the animal's neck goes in at the wrong place, so the bull capers around the ring with blood spurting out), the crowd cries out angrily to the bullfighter: \"Maric\u00f3n!\" (\"Maric\u00f3n!\" meaning \"Poofter!\"). Interesting that they use the term as an insult, since there is something very effeminate about the concept of machismo in general, and especially bullfighters who wear pink boleros and black ballet pumps and strut around in poses that outline their groin to the best advantage. Bullfights make the English preoccupation with foxes and pheasants seem very arbitrary. It makes you ponder on the meaning of life in an absurd and incoherent universe. That pheasant the Queen killed might well be reincarnated as a bull in Andalusia, and it might get killed by a poofter, and then it would be sorry. Besides, between bullfights and those people who phone up Radio 5 call-ins to say that homosexuality (pronounced with flat o's to make it sound like the BSE virus) is bad because the Bible says so, I'd take the bullfights - even though they grate after a while. You quickly get bored of seeing bulls being killed and start thinking that maybe it would be nice for a giraffe or two to be brought on. A few rabbits, too, maybe. Happiness, as the Arabs say, is in the saddle. The best bit of the sun as drug is the part when you are sitting in the restaurant eating your paella, drinking your Penedes and experiencing an escapist rush like the distant echo of some happiness you once knew. By the time you are down to your last pieces of squid, you are glowing. You turn towards the sea and you scoff at the craving for stability and security. \u0095 Stephanie Theobald's novel, Biche, is published by Flame at \u00a310.99. Julie Burchill is away.",

Imagine, he wrote, that we read of an election in which the self-declared winner was the son of the former prime minister, and that the former prime minister was himself the former head of the nation's secret police (George Bush Senior was head of the CIA). Imagine that the self-declared winner lost the popular vote but won the election because of some old colonial holdover (the electoral college) from the nation's past. Imagine that the self-declared winner's \"victory\" turned on disputed votes cast in a province governed by his brother. Imagine that the poorly drafted ballots of one district that heavily favoured the self-declared winner's opponent led thousands to vote for the wrong candidate. </p> <p>Imagine that members of the nation's most-despised caste, fearing for their lives/livelihoods, turned out in record numbers to vote in near-universal opposition to the self-declared winner. Imagine that hundreds of members of that caste were intercepted on their way to the polls by state police operating under the authority of the self-declared winner's brother. Imagine that six million people voted in the disputed province and that the self-declared winner's \"lead\" was only 327. Imagine that the self-declared winner and his party opposed a by-hand inspection and re-count in the disputed province or in its most hotly disputed district. </p> <p>Imagine that the self-declared winner, himself the governor of a major province, was responsible for the worst human rights record of any province in his nation and led the nation in executions, and that a major campaign promise was to appoint like-minded human rights violators to lifetime positions on the high court of that nation. \"None of us,\" the Clinton official concluded, \"would deem such an election to be representative of anything other than the self-declared winner's will to power. All of us, I imagine, would wearily turn the page, thinking that it was another sad tale of pitiful pre- or anti-democracy peoples in some strange elsewhere.\" </p> <p>Most Americans, though beginning to feel impatient and wanting Al Gore to concede just to get the whole thing over with, believe that the blizzard of law suits, re-counts, aborted re-counts and overturned executive decisions in the state of Florida reflect well on America's democratic institutions. Why would people go to all this trouble and expense if not out of concern for the principle that every vote counts? </p> <p>Actually, the scenario offered by our partisan friend in the White House, for all its obvious exaggerations, is somewhat nearer the mark. Thanks mainly to Florida's primitive punch-card technology, which spews out ambiguous dimpled or pregnant chads, there is no way that every vote could be made to count, even if the Florida legislature had used its power to order a state-wide re-count, which it didn't. </p> <p>Second, the candidates themselves have assiduously promoted the idea that the state officials responsible for administering the election are too politically biased to be trusted. The George W Bush camp questioned the integrity of the officials re-counting votes in Democrat counties, while the Gore camp never ceased to point out that Katherine Harris - the \"Dragon Lady of Tallahassee\" and the woman who used her position as Florida's secretary of state to sabotage the re-counts - had been an active campaigner for Bush during the election. Her certification of Bush as the winner was then rubber-stamped with indecent haste by the governor of Florida, Bush's brother Jeb, even though President Clinton still refused to give \"President-elect\" Bush the key to the transition office in Washington or the $5.3m in federal funds allocated for preparing the next president to take over. </p> <p> Given Florida's inability or unwillingness, or both, to produce a plausible result, it is clearly a \"will to power\", not concern for democracy, that has driven the candidates on in their post-election struggle. No amount of fake humility and statesmanship has been able to disguise this. Bush, exuding shallowness and opportunism, stood between two huge American flags when he went on television humbly to assume the burden of an office that still wasn't his. Gore, as the underdog, had four flags behind him when he went on TV next day to challenge Bush's victory claim - for no other purpose, he said, than to preserve \"democracy itself\". </p> <p>In the outcome of this election, because it was effectively a draw, the will of the people cannot be the decisive factor. Until the US Supreme Court makes some magisterial judgment, it can be decided not by numbers of votes but by which candidate blinks first and concedes: that is, whoever feels he is losing the television battle. Even to fans of the American democratic system, the US is looking like \"some strange elsewhere\".</p>",

      "body": "<p>The former president of Chile, Augusto Pinochet, was last night placed under house arrest after he was indicted in Chile for his role in a series of crimes, including kidnapping, murder, torture, illegal burial and illicit association.</p> <p>General Pinochet will be tried for his role in a series of crimes committed under his dictatorship, in a case that could last for several years.</p> <p>Gen Pinochet will now be required to submit to medical examinations to determine whether he is fit to stand trial. However, under Chilean law, he will only escape prosecution only if he is mentally incapable of understanding the process or of defending himself.</p> <p>The decision to indict Gen Pinochet comes nine months after the home secretary Jack Straw allowed Gen Pinochet to return from Britain to Chile on humanitarian grounds after a team of doctors ruled he was too ill to face trial.</p> <p>Gen Pinochet's opponents rejoiced at the news. Carlos Reyes, of London-based human rights group Chile Democratico, who was tortured under the Pinochet regime, said many of his countrymen would be dancing in the streets.</p> <p>\"I am really deeply touched. He should be tried and judged for the crimes he committed during so many years.\"</p> <p>Gen Pinochet's indictment was moved by Juan Guzman Tapia, a senior Chilean appeal court judge who has been leading the investigation. His decision was precipitated on Monday when a Chilean lawyer, Jose Galiano, submitted a formal request on behalf of a number of plaintiffs to indict Gen Pinochet, accusing him of crimes against more than 500 victims.</p> <p>Among the cases that Judge Guzman has investigated are the disappearances of 19 prisoners in the first months of his 17-year dictatorship. The judge also looked into the deaths of more than 70 people in the so-called Caravan of Death - a special mission led by the then General Sergio Arellano Starck in October 1973.</p> <p>Travelling by helicopter, Gen Arellano toured several towns, mostly in the mining areas of northern Chile. At all points on his route, several men were taken out and executed. Many were union leaders or functionaries of the government of Salvador Allende which Gen Pinochet overthrew in 1973.</p> <p>There were several legal obstacles to the prosecution of Gen Pinochet in Chile, but these have been progressively removed. Gen Pinochet's par liamentary immunity, which he held by virtue of his position as a senator for life in the Chilean parliament, was removed by the Chilean supreme court in August.</p> <p>The case remains highly sensitive in Chile. The indictment is likely to provoke a storm and to cause embarrassment to President Ricardo Lagos, who has been trying to improve relations with Chile's still powerful armed forces.</p> <p>Gen Pinochet supporters last night denounced the forthcoming trial as a travesty of justice. \"This is an aberration of jurisprudence,\" said Fernando Barros, a Chilean lawyer, who argued the indictment was an attempt by \"certain persons intent on changing historical truths\".</p> <p>The investigation of Gen Pinochet was stimulated by his arrest in London in October 1998. Gen Pinochet was detained as a result of an extradition request by a Spanish judge, Baltazar Garzon, who wanted to try him in Spain for what he argued were crimes against humanity and therefore subject to international jurisdiction.</p> <p>His last public appearance was on November 25, on his 85th birthday, when he greeted well wishers at his home in Santiago. Gen Pinochet called his detention in London \"unjust\" and said that he had argued that Chilean justice was as good as the justice of another country.</p> <p><b>Timetable</b></p> <p><b> October 16 1998</b> Pinochet arrested in London on Spanish courts' order</p> <p><b> March 24 1999 </b> British law lords rule he does not have immunity</p> <p><b> September 27 1999</b> Formal extradition proceedings begin in London</p> <p><b> October 8 1999</b> British magistrate rules Spain can extradite Pinochet</p> <p><b> March 2 2000</b> Jack Straw releases Pinochet, declaring him unfit for trial</p> <p><b> August 2000</b> Chilean supreme court strips him of immunity</p> <p><b> December 1 2000</b> Formally charged</p>",

General Pinochet will be tried for his role in a series of crimes committed under his dictatorship, in a case that could last for several years. Gen Pinochet will now be required to submit to medical examinations to determine whether he is fit to stand trial. However, under Chilean law, he will only escape prosecution only if he is mentally incapable of understanding the process or of defending himself. The decision to indict Gen Pinochet comes nine months after the home secretary Jack Straw allowed Gen Pinochet to return from Britain to Chile on humanitarian grounds after a team of doctors ruled he was too ill to face trial. Gen Pinochet's opponents rejoiced at the news. Carlos Reyes, of London-based human rights group Chile Democratico, who was tortured under the Pinochet regime, said many of his countrymen would be dancing in the streets. \"I am really deeply touched. He should be tried and judged for the crimes he committed during so many years.\" Gen Pinochet's indictment was moved by Juan Guzman Tapia, a senior Chilean appeal court judge who has been leading the investigation. His decision was precipitated on Monday when a Chilean lawyer, Jose Galiano, submitted a formal request on behalf of a number of plaintiffs to indict Gen Pinochet, accusing him of crimes against more than 500 victims. Among the cases that Judge Guzman has investigated are the disappearances of 19 prisoners in the first months of his 17-year dictatorship. The judge also looked into the deaths of more than 70 people in the so-called Caravan of Death - a special mission led by the then General Sergio Arellano Starck in October 1973. Travelling by helicopter, Gen Arellano toured several towns, mostly in the mining areas of northern Chile. At all points on his route, several men were taken out and executed. Many were union leaders or functionaries of the government of Salvador Allende which Gen Pinochet overthrew in 1973. There were several legal obstacles to the prosecution of Gen Pinochet in Chile, but these have been progressively removed. Gen Pinochet's par liamentary immunity, which he held by virtue of his position as a senator for life in the Chilean parliament, was removed by the Chilean supreme court in August. The case remains highly sensitive in Chile. The indictment is likely to provoke a storm and to cause embarrassment to President Ricardo Lagos, who has been trying to improve relations with Chile's still powerful armed forces. Gen Pinochet supporters last night denounced the forthcoming trial as a travesty of justice. \"This is an aberration of jurisprudence,\" said Fernando Barros, a Chilean lawyer, who argued the indictment was an attempt by \"certain persons intent on changing historical truths\". The investigation of Gen Pinochet was stimulated by his arrest in London in October 1998. Gen Pinochet was detained as a result of an extradition request by a Spanish judge, Baltazar Garzon, who wanted to try him in Spain for what he argued were crimes against humanity and therefore subject to international jurisdiction. His last public appearance was on November 25, on his 85th birthday, when he greeted well wishers at his home in Santiago. Gen Pinochet called his detention in London \"unjust\" and said that he had argued that Chilean justice was as good as the justice of another country. Timetable October 16 1998 Pinochet arrested in London on Spanish courts' order March 24 1999 British law lords rule he does not have immunity September 27 1999 Formal extradition proceedings begin in London October 8 1999 British magistrate rules Spain can extradite Pinochet March 2 2000 Jack Straw releases Pinochet, declaring him unfit for trial August 2000 Chilean supreme court strips him of immunity December 1 2000 Formally charged",

He was speaking the day after the Tories deserted the first government inspired Commons debate on poverty in Britain, leaving Labour and Liberal Democrats to debate the issue alone.</p> <p>The Labour MP Caroline Flint said the absence of any Tory MPs for more than two hours spoke volumes about the priorities of the Conservatives. The party's front bench spokesman, Eric Pickles, left after making a brief speech.</p> <p>Mr Streeter said in an interview with GMTV's The Review programme, to be shown on Sunday, that many of the party's new leading figures are largely unknown to the public.</p> <p>His comments came as both published and private polls yesterday showed the Tories trailing badly and on course for a 100-seat defeat.</p> <p>A poll in the London Evening Standard put Labour on 50 points in the capital, 19 ahead of the Conservatives. The Tories lost three-quarters of their seats in the capital in the 1997 election and would be likely to fare no better if they continue to trail by such a margin. Private polls suggest the Tories are also doing poorly in vital marginal seats.</p> <p>Mr Streeter said there was \"a third limb to 21st century Conservatism and it's about dealing with some of the social problems of the poor\".</p> <p>\"I long for us to be thought of now as the party of the poor, that we are the voice for the people who have nothing because we are going to come up with radical policies to penetrate some of our inner city problems ... we've got to find much more radical ways drawing on the voluntary and faith based charitable sector to find solutions to people's misery in some of our inner cities.\"</p> <p>Although he said the party had a strong team and he was confident of Mr Hague's leadership, Mr Streeter said: \"I think one of the problems is we're in a period of transition. Some of our big beasts are retiring and a lot of older people are retiring and lot of younger people are coming through, but people have not heard of them yet, so that will take a while\".</p> <p>Similar refrains have been heard about the Conservative front bench for three years.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Tories have been concentrating their fire on the issue of Europe, but a massive bombardment on the issue of the European rapid reaction force, backed by close supporting fire from the Eurosceptic press, had no impact.</p> <p>Polls in both the Daily Telegraph and the Mail on Sunday by separate polling organisations showed most voters thought Britain should contribute forces. The Mail on Sunday poll backed British involvement by 55% to 38%. The Telegraph poll showed 48% to 34% support.</p>",

OK, maybe we won't quite complete the task in time, but we have got to do that task within the next few years.\" He also praised the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, for personally struggling with the dilemma of how the Conservatives needed to move on. Mr Streeter, a Christian, said he longed for the Tories to be thought of as the party of the poor. He was speaking the day after the Tories deserted the first government inspired Commons debate on poverty in Britain, leaving Labour and Liberal Democrats to debate the issue alone. The Labour MP Caroline Flint said the absence of any Tory MPs for more than two hours spoke volumes about the priorities of the Conservatives. The party's front bench spokesman, Eric Pickles, left after making a brief speech. Mr Streeter said in an interview with GMTV's The Review programme, to be shown on Sunday, that many of the party's new leading figures are largely unknown to the public. His comments came as both published and private polls yesterday showed the Tories trailing badly and on course for a 100-seat defeat. A poll in the London Evening Standard put Labour on 50 points in the capital, 19 ahead of the Conservatives. The Tories lost three-quarters of their seats in the capital in the 1997 election and would be likely to fare no better if they continue to trail by such a margin. Private polls suggest the Tories are also doing poorly in vital marginal seats. Mr Streeter said there was \"a third limb to 21st century Conservatism and it's about dealing with some of the social problems of the poor\". \"I long for us to be thought of now as the party of the poor, that we are the voice for the people who have nothing because we are going to come up with radical policies to penetrate some of our inner city problems ... we've got to find much more radical ways drawing on the voluntary and faith based charitable sector to find solutions to people's misery in some of our inner cities.\" Although he said the party had a strong team and he was confident of Mr Hague's leadership, Mr Streeter said: \"I think one of the problems is we're in a period of transition. Some of our big beasts are retiring and a lot of older people are retiring and lot of younger people are coming through, but people have not heard of them yet, so that will take a while\". Similar refrains have been heard about the Conservative front bench for three years. In recent weeks, the Tories have been concentrating their fire on the issue of Europe, but a massive bombardment on the issue of the European rapid reaction force, backed by close supporting fire from the Eurosceptic press, had no impact. Polls in both the Daily Telegraph and the Mail on Sunday by separate polling organisations showed most voters thought Britain should contribute forces. The Mail on Sunday poll backed British involvement by 55% to 38%. The Telegraph poll showed 48% to 34% support.",

      "body": "<p>Mary Quant, the fashion icon who was the inspiration for the swinging 60s, has resigned from her empire under a veil of silence. The woman who claimed she invented the mini-skirt and did invent hot pants resigned as a director of her company, Mary Quant Ltd, and will no longer have control of her universally famous name or the simple daisy design that became synonymous with her creations.</p> <p>Speculation is rife that Ms Quant, who was the catalyst for the 60s revolution and put London fashion on the world map, has effectively been ousted from her position as director.</p> <p>The affair has been cloaked in secrecy, with all staff having to sign confidentiality agreements with the Japanese businessmen who hold the licensing agreements for the Quant name.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Mary Quant confirmed that the designer had been made a \"generous offer\" by her Japanese licensees. She said Quant, whose married name is Plunkett Greene, no longer has anything to do with the day-to-day running of the company and, since October, came in to the office less. The spokeswoman said Quant would be a consultant and was happy with the arrangement.</p> <p>James Matsumiya, Mary Quant Ltd's managing director, said yesterday: \"At the moment I am legally bound not to talk about it until Mary Quant and I have agreed on wording. Then we will make an announcement. We do not want to mention what we are trying to do at the moment.\"</p> <p>One former senior Quant employee said: \"As a business, it wouldn't surprise me if Mary has been carved out. Mary was very independent minded and accountants were necessary evils. It's the story of an entrepreneur being forced into a large company environment and not liking it. Anyone can be a casualty, their name doesn't necessarily protect them.\"</p> <p>Archie McNair, who co-founded the company with Quant and her late husband Alexander Plunkett Greene in October 1955 and was chairman until 1988, said he was unsure of the details of the deal. \"As I understand it, the Japanese have made Mary an offer and I suppose it's too good for her to refuse. She's a very famous girl and has still got plenty to offer.\"</p> <p>Mr McNair, who said he and Quant and her husband \"had some wonderful times\" with their business, said it was an unusual situation for someone now to have control of the Quant name. He added: \"Mary had a very good working relationship with the Japanese. She hasn't just capitulated.\"</p> <p>Quant is now 66 but sources said she was not yet ready for retirement. While she no longer designed collections, the woman who was given an OBE in 1966 and is represented in the Fashion Hall of Fame would design smaller pieces and cast her eye over products being manufactured in her name.</p> <p>Quant's influence within the fashion community was once enormous. In Vogue: Twentieth Century Fashion, published this week, it says: \"Quant had a cataclysmic effect on London, with her simple daisy motif, short skirts, mix of music and model, Twiggy.\" It points out that Quant's \"international name and logo, associated with youth and freshness, enabled her to change direction and encompass kitchenware, stationery and fabulous make-up\".</p> <p>Quant was the unrivalled queen of swinging London, she created the Chelsea Girl and kicked off the trendiness of the city's Kings Road. One article said: \"It is given to a fortunate few to be born at the right time, in the right place, with the right talents. In recent fashion, there are three: Chanel, Dior and Mary Quant.\"</p> <p>Quant did not just design, but influenced the attitude of the 60s, dying her pubic hair green and telling the public about it and infamously talking about that taboo area \"the crutch\" in an interview for The Guardian's 1967 groundbreaking series, The Permissive Society.</p> <p>Quant's shop Bazaar - which she set up with her husband and Mr McNair - was the place to be in London. The Beatles often popped in to buy designs for their girlfriends and George Harrison married the model Patti Boyd in clothes designed by Quant. Her friends include David Bailey and Terence Conran and Sassoon still cuts that famous hair every now and again.</p> <p>Quant was responsible for hot pants, the Lolita look, the slip dress, PVC raincoats, smoky eyes and sleek bob haircuts, but it was make-up that eventually made her company the most money. Her immediately identifiable bottles of nail varnish and capsules of lipstick were licensed to be sold around the world. The current license is held by Mary Quant Cosmetics Japan Ltd - there are now more than 200 Mary Quant Colour shopsin Japan, generating around \u00a395m a year, while there are just two in London.</p> <p>Quant lives a quiet life between homes in Surrey and Grasse. She is a non-executive director of the House of Fraser group.</p> <p>There had been speculation that the performance of Mary Quant Ltd was not as good as it could have been, with its retained profit falling from nearly \u00a3400,000 to less than \u00a350,000. Quant's resignation leaves the company in the control of Mr Matsumiya, who lives in Buckinghamshire, and Masaaki Michitani and Juichi Nakayam, who both live in Japan.</p> <p><b>Chelsea girl who instigated a new era</b><br><br>Jess Cartner-Morley, fashion editor<br><br> Contrary to popular legend, Mary Quant invented neither the miniskirt (that was Courr\u00e8ges) nor coloured patterned tights (Balenciaga). In fact, she invented something much more important. She instigated a new era in style, one in which fashion was for any modern young working girl rather than just for rich ladies. Anyone could wear a Quant mini, if they had the legs.</p> <p>At Mary Quant's Bazaar, the tiny shop which burst onto London's Kings Road in the mid-50s, the look was of a sulky, coquettish French schoolgirl - skinny rib poloneck sweaters, miniskirts, bright tights and knee-high boots, with geometric Sassoon bobs, kohl-rimmed eyes and coltish turned-in toes.</p> <p>Quant's designs played with proportion: men's shirts were slimmed down and elongated and worn, just with tights, by women; hotpants appeared for the first time. Even knickerbockers made a brief comeback.

      "bodyText": "Mary Quant, the fashion icon who was the inspiration for the swinging 60s, has resigned from her empire under a veil of silence. The woman who claimed she invented the mini-skirt and did invent hot pants resigned as a director of her company, Mary Quant Ltd, and will no longer have control of her universally famous name or the simple daisy design that became synonymous with her creations. Speculation is rife that Ms Quant, who was the catalyst for the 60s revolution and put London fashion on the world map, has effectively been ousted from her position as director. The affair has been cloaked in secrecy, with all staff having to sign confidentiality agreements with the Japanese businessmen who hold the licensing agreements for the Quant name. A spokeswoman for Mary Quant confirmed that the designer had been made a \"generous offer\" by her Japanese licensees. She said Quant, whose married name is Plunkett Greene, no longer has anything to do with the day-to-day running of the company and, since October, came in to the office less. The spokeswoman said Quant would be a consultant and was happy with the arrangement. James Matsumiya, Mary Quant Ltd's managing director, said yesterday: \"At the moment I am legally bound not to talk about it until Mary Quant and I have agreed on wording. Then we will make an announcement. We do not want to mention what we are trying to do at the moment.\" One former senior Quant employee said: \"As a business, it wouldn't surprise me if Mary has been carved out. Mary was very independent minded and accountants were necessary evils. It's the story of an entrepreneur being forced into a large company environment and not liking it. Anyone can be a casualty, their name doesn't necessarily protect them.\" Archie McNair, who co-founded the company with Quant and her late husband Alexander Plunkett Greene in October 1955 and was chairman until 1988, said he was unsure of the details of the deal. \"As I understand it, the Japanese have made Mary an offer and I suppose it's too good for her to refuse. She's a very famous girl and has still got plenty to offer.\" Mr McNair, who said he and Quant and her husband \"had some wonderful times\" with their business, said it was an unusual situation for someone now to have control of the Quant name. He added: \"Mary had a very good working relationship with the Japanese. She hasn't just capitulated.\" Quant is now 66 but sources said she was not yet ready for retirement. While she no longer designed collections, the woman who was given an OBE in 1966 and is represented in the Fashion Hall of Fame would design smaller pieces and cast her eye over products being manufactured in her name. Quant's influence within the fashion community was once enormous. In Vogue: Twentieth Century Fashion, published this week, it says: \"Quant had a cataclysmic effect on London, with her simple daisy motif, short skirts, mix of music and model, Twiggy.\" It points out that Quant's \"international name and logo, associated with youth and freshness, enabled her to change direction and encompass kitchenware, stationery and fabulous make-up\". Quant was the unrivalled queen of swinging London, she created the Chelsea Girl and kicked off the trendiness of the city's Kings Road. One article said: \"It is given to a fortunate few to be born at the right time, in the right place, with the right talents. In recent fashion, there are three: Chanel, Dior and Mary Quant.\" Quant did not just design, but influenced the attitude of the 60s, dying her pubic hair green and telling the public about it and infamously talking about that taboo area \"the crutch\" in an interview for The Guardian's 1967 groundbreaking series, The Permissive Society. Quant's shop Bazaar - which she set up with her husband and Mr McNair - was the place to be in London. The Beatles often popped in to buy designs for their girlfriends and George Harrison married the model Patti Boyd in clothes designed by Quant. Her friends include David Bailey and Terence Conran and Sassoon still cuts that famous hair every now and again. Quant was responsible for hot pants, the Lolita look, the slip dress, PVC raincoats, smoky eyes and sleek bob haircuts, but it was make-up that eventually made her company the most money. Her immediately identifiable bottles of nail varnish and capsules of lipstick were licensed to be sold around the world. The current license is held by Mary Quant Cosmetics Japan Ltd - there are now more than 200 Mary Quant Colour shopsin Japan, generating around \u00a395m a year, while there are just two in London. Quant lives a quiet life between homes in Surrey and Grasse. She is a non-executive director of the House of Fraser group. There had been speculation that the performance of Mary Quant Ltd was not as good as it could have been, with its retained profit falling from nearly \u00a3400,000 to less than \u00a350,000. Quant's resignation leaves the company in the control of Mr Matsumiya, who lives in Buckinghamshire, and Masaaki Michitani and Juichi Nakayam, who both live in Japan. Chelsea girl who instigated a new era Jess Cartner-Morley, fashion editor Contrary to popular legend, Mary Quant invented neither the miniskirt (that was Courr\u00e8ges) nor coloured patterned tights (Balenciaga). In fact, she invented something much more important. She instigated a new era in style, one in which fashion was for any modern young working girl rather than just for rich ladies. Anyone could wear a Quant mini, if they had the legs. At Mary Quant's Bazaar, the tiny shop which burst onto London's Kings Road in the mid-50s, the look was of a sulky, coquettish French schoolgirl - skinny rib poloneck sweaters, miniskirts, bright tights and knee-high boots, with geometric Sassoon bobs, kohl-rimmed eyes and coltish turned-in toes. Quant's designs played with proportion: men's shirts were slimmed down and elongated and worn, just with tights, by women; hotpants appeared for the first time. Even knickerbockers made a brief comeback. Quant recalls that when she asked manufacturers to make up her unusual patterns, \"most would just send us packing\". Quant has said that she identifies with Coco Chanel. Like Chanel, she liberated the women she dressed: \"I wanted to make clothes that you could move in, skirts you could run and dance in,\" she has said. The original Chelsea Girl placed the girls of swinging London at the epicentre of fashion, but her influence stretched way beyond: by 1969 it was estimated up to 7m women had a Quant label in their wardrobe. Quant was so inextricably associated with the sixties that the fading of her star once that decade ended was almost inevitable. In the 80s her name returned to glossy magazines - but in the beauty pages with blue nail polishes and silver eyeliners bearing the trademark daisy of the designer who said \"good taste is death, vulgarity is life\". Quant may be bowing out, but the Mary Quant look is still being worn today - in Tokyo, where a cartoonish version, featuring short skirts, boots, white tights and pale lipstick, has become de rigueur amongst teenage girls.",

But lawyers have since argued successfully that in cases where the remains of the victims of presumed extra-judicial killings have not been found, the case should be considered one of ongoing kidnapping - and therefore still open. Executions On the other side of the equation were the families of the victims who had been attempting for more than 20 years to bring legal cases connected with the extra-judicial executions and disappearances perpetrated under the dictatorship.

Nine days after the raid on the fishing town of Nueva Venecia, on the Caribbean coast, the death toll was still uncertain and one report indicated that as many as 86 people may have been killed. The bullet-riddled bodies of the missing are still turning up in swamps around the town. Nueva Venecia is in the heart of a fishing and banana-producing region where communist-led rebels and ultra-right paramilitary groups have long battled for control. The bloodshed began at dawn on November 22 when gunmen - suspected members of the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), the leading paramilitary force - began calling out the names of towns people on a \"hit list\" of alleged collaborators of Marxist rebels operating in the area. Colombia's national human rights ombudsman, Eduardo Cifuentes, who is expected to issue an official report on the massacre before the weekend, said 2,000 people had fled the town since the attack.",

      "body": "<p>On Saturday July 8 this year, Yvonne Murphy, head of the political collection at Belfast's Linen Hall library, drove the 10 miles south-west from the city to the gates of the Maze prison. The authorities had been expecting her, and she came away with seven large brown paper sacks stuffed with books. </p> <p>There were more than 1,700 of them. Books that told tales beyond the words they held. Books on politics and revolution, history, literature, language, and sociology. Books with spines split by overuse, pages thumbed thin, corners folded sharp as shirt collars, margins laddered with neat and painstaking notes. </p> <p>This was the library of the IRA. </p> <p>They used to say you could lose your sight if you were long enough at the Maze, so monotonously grey were the walls and wire. This bleak compound has become a headstone for Northern Ireland's agony. From the early internment camp of Long Kesh to the notorious H-blocks, through the blanket protest and the hunger strike to the genesis of the peace process and the final closing of its gates this summer, the story of the Maze is the story of the Troubles. And that story can be followed in the books that found their way into its cells. </p> <p>For the last four months, the books that Yvonne Murphy retrieved have been listed and studied in the depths of the Linen Hall. This week they will be boxed up and returned to the republican ex-prisoners, and Murphy fears they might be lost for ever. She has no doubts about their cultural and political significance </p> <p>\"You have this very famous group of prisoners reading this material. For the whole period of the peace process the prisoners were viewed as very important and this was informing what they thought. It is hugely significant. </p> <p>\"We had heard there was this unofficial library, this vast resource, in the Maze, so we made contact with the IRA and the prison authorities and got permission to collect and record it.\" </p> <p>Murphy is desperate to find a loyalist equivalent but has been unable to ascertain if one exists. There have been casually flung rumours that the loyalist collection consisted largely of a stash of pornography, body- building magazines and the biographies of serial killers. Loyalists who served time in the Maze tell a different story; of a passion for books to match the republicans', and a hunger for knowledge in a setting stripped of stimulation. But no evidence of any loyalist library has survived. </p> <p>The IRA collection is almost exclusively paperback; hardbacks hide weapons. They are almost all worn, though not carelessly so. There is little doodling and almost no defacing. There are at least 11 copies of Lenin's The State and the Revolution, one carefully re- covered in a smoothed-out brown paper bag. There are also numerous copies of Marx and Engels' Manifesto of the Communist Party, and works by Freud, Trotsky, Kafka and Mao Zedong. There are biographies of Margaret Thatcher, Enoch Powell and Ian Paisley, and books on Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Palestine, South Africa and the Basque separatists. </p> <p>Frantz Fanon's classic anti-colonial text, The Wretched of the Earth, sits beside Henry Pelling's Origins of the Labour Party and works by the Brazilian theorist Paolo Freire. There is a shelf full of National Geographic magazines dating from 1974 to 1997 and a broad range of Irish-language texts as well as numerous works by Irish writers and thinkers. Ernie O'Malley and Sean O' Faolain compete for space with James Joyce and the Irish Feminist Review. </p> <p>There is precious little light reading. Any novels are weighty and worthy; Dickens and Orwell and James Hogg's The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Jus tified Sinner. There are a couple of John Grishams and Wilbur Smiths and the only apparent example of pulp fiction is a fat paperback, whose cover promises the adventures of an SAS sergeant-major and a beautiful Soviet spy, but which contains the text of Who Framed Colin Wallace?, Paul Foot's 1989 investigative work on the jailing of a military intelligence officer. </p> <p>There are works that surprise by their presence and some that shock profoundly. The thin red spine of a book on the Enniskillen atrocity, when an IRA bomb killed 11 people on Remembrance Sunday in 1987, sits alongside Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago, and Jonathan Glover's Causing Death and Saving Lives: The Moral Problems of Life or Death Choices. </p> <p>And, sometimes, amid the thought and fervour, a flash of poignancy. A parents' guide to epilepsy, a book on child development, a self-help guide to dealing with nerves, a joke book, home wine-making the right way, a pocket Roget's Thesaurus that lists three owners, a collection of Irish love stories. </p> <p>\"The first thing that strikes you is the seriousness and breadth of the material,\" says Richard English, professor of politics at Queen's University in Belfast, who has done a structural analysis of the collection. \"The second is the amount of leftwing material. You get a sense of a revolutionary leftist movement and this reflects the period in which the books were put together and devoured. After the hunger strikes there was a very strong leftwing commitment by the republicans. It is an evocation of a particular episode in republican thinking. </p> <p>\"The collection also makes it clear they were just desperate for knowledge. The intensity of the material reflects that.\" </p> <p>Jackie McMullan remembers that desperation. He served 16 years in the Maze for the attempted murder of an RUC officer and was on hunger strike for 48 days. Between 1976 and 1981, during the blanket and dirty protests, inmates were not allowed any reading material apart from the Bible. </p> <p>\"You can imagine there was a massive appetite for reading immediately after the blanket protest,\" McMullan says. \"I had a list of about 20 books in my head. At the start it was only religious books we were allowed. But we were flexible enough to turn that into religious novels. Believe it or not, some of them are half decent. After a couple of years we were able to get political books.\" </p> <p>McMullan's imagined list included John Reed's memoir of the Russian revolution, Ten Days That Shook the World; Wilfred Burchett's Grasshoppers and Elephants: Why Vietnam Fell; and Orwell's Homage to Catalonia. </p> <p>\"I got them all and I read them in about three weeks. I'm not a fast reader. I've known guys who can read 600 pages a day. I would read about 200 pages a day but there were weeks where I read three books, one after the other.\" </p> <p>Rejecting the prison education service, the IRA set up its own education structure in the Maze. The \u00a32 a week they got from the prison authorities was pooled to buy tobacco and set up a book fund. Copies came from friends, relatives and bookstores in Ireland and England. </p> <p>\"For us, education was central,\" says McMullan, who now runs a support group for ex-prisoners. \"We used to say, 'You could be here for the next 20 years. You don't want to leave jail exactly as you came in. Put it to good use.' It was a driving force. It was very central to what we were all about. </p> <p>The books we were really interested in were in relation to foreign struggles; Vietnam, Nicaragua, written revolution, Marxist Leninism, Irish history. There was a period after the protest when we were just totally Marxist Leninist; anything else was just not worthwhile. Even if you had a book on anarchists you would have not been taken seriously. If you had got a book in on football you would have got a bit of stick. It would have been like getting a comic. You would have to hide it. </p> <p>\"We had just come out of five intensive years of protest. Ten of our friends and comrades had died in the hunger strike. We were pretty serious people at that stage.\" </p> <p>Danny Morrison, former publicity director for Sinn Fein, who served time in the Maze in the early 1990s, believes the intensity relating to the books reached an unhealthy level in the earlier days. As the inmates struggled to find a focus for their beliefs and used literature and learning to inform and fine-tune their attitudes, their families were dealing with the stark financial and social realities of life beyond the wire. </p> <p>\"I think the books are probably a a microcosm of the type of thinking that was going on. There was just this massive drive for a more ideological foundation for their beliefs,\" said Morrison. \"But I believe that the atmosphere was so rarefied that it led to a distortion of the analysis. There was too much emphasis on Marxism and, I thought, too much dependence on the theoretical, particularly of a Marxist bent. It had to be tempered with the practicalities of life.\" </p> <p>Morrison, now a writer, said the thinking, and the books, began to change with the collapse of communism, a shift that coincided with IRA inmates being paroled and a new generation of republican prisoners arriving. </p> <p>\"After the fall of the Berlin wall, the prisoners had to realign themselves and I think it was quite a shock to the main thinkers. They had been out of contact with the outside world and reality. I think after that people fell back into more traditional republican analysis. Certainly a more pragmatic approach started to be adopted. </p> <p>\"At that stage the republicans started taking parole. They had been in for 15 or 16 years and they were now getting out for a weekend and that informed their attitudes. Then there were others coming in from the 1980s with a less doctrinal approach.\" </p> <p>Richard English notes that the IRA's identification with flashpoints elsewhere in the world tracks through the books. \"The two places that seemed to be the most telling were the Middle East and South Africa,\" he says. \"There are obvious differences between Northern Ireland and those two, but for the republicans the identification with Palestine and the blacks of South Africa had a resonance that was very important to them. In some way developments in those areas of peace processes meant that there was an echo of the kind of changes happening in the republican movement and a kind of reinforcement of that shift.\" </p> <p>The fall of communism was deeply unsettling for the republican inmates, and McMullan says the collection reflects the reorientation taking place beyond the prison walls. \"It did have an effect,\" he says. \"Not to the extent where people would say, 'That's it, we can forget about it.' People adapted. In the late 80s more would have got into feminism, ecology and environmental issues.\" </p> <p>He says the 1,700 books held at the Linen Hall library are representative but are only a fraction of the entire IRA Maze collection, which he estimates at 16,000 works. Most were taken home when the prisoners left. </p> <p>There is talk of setting up a lending library with the remaining books, but McMullan is still wondering what to do with the part of the collection that the Linen Hall librarians have yet to see; five boxes full of the IRA's own works from the Maze - essays, theses, notes, letters and memos. They include a history of the prison in 24 chapters, a notebook titled Scenarios for a British Withdrawal, a five-page handwritten essay on Morality of the Armed Struggle, another notebook titled The Guerrilla Fighter, and letters from solicitors and politicians. </p> <p>McMullan believes it is priceless. Richard English has seen the collection and believes that the seeds of the peace process may lie in the level of serious reflection infused in the documents and papers. As with the books that the Linen Hall has already studied and listed, the material in McMullan's boxes maps out the shifts and developments in republican think ing over the years: a thorough exploration of ideology. </p> <p>Frankie Gallagher, however, might think it was propaganda. Gallagher, who works with loyalist ex-prisoners in east Belfast, says they felt no need to create an archive from the Maze or publicise their reading matter. </p> <p>\"The loyalists were very much a reactionary force,\" he said. \"They were husbands, fathers, grandfathers who reacted to the bombs and the killing, the republican violence. And it was done in the background of what they saw as the government they were trying to defend imprisoning them. So it was not an ideology, a struggle for loyalists. It never came to that. That is why the loyalists didn't have the central plank of organising things or keeping things for posterity. They weren't into propaganda.\" </p> <p>But they were into books, according to Martin Snodden, who served 15 years in the Maze for murder and is now director of EPIC, a support group for UVF ex-prisoners. \"Books were almost in a sense like a life's blood,\" he said. \"It was information. There was a hunger with regards to knowledge that existed within the prison itself from books to the quality papers like the Sunday Times and the Observer. They were scanned in great detail and there were waiting lists to read them. The Sunday Times would come in and it could be the following Wednesday before you got a look at it. </p> <p>\"There was no library as such. You have to understand that in the loyalist wings people more or less had their own books and they were passed between us. My experience was that if someone had a book in there were about 20 people waiting to read it. There were Irish history books, and other books on politics and social injustice.\" </p> <p>Snodden's colleague at EPIC, Tom Roberts, who spent time in the H-blocks, said he and many of his fellow loyalist inmates took full advantage of the education service offered through the prison, and he dismisses the rumours that the loyalists' private collection was mostly made up of pornographic and weightlifting magazines. </p> <p>\"I can assure you that was not the case. Everybody had their own taste. There were a lot of history books, Irish history, English history and a lot about other conflicts in other parts of the world. There was a lot of educational reading went on, because many of us did degrees. </p> <p>\"I am not denying that people would have read whatever they would like to read and that includes the republicans. I think prisoners are like every cross- section of society. There is a wide variation in tastes.\" </p> <p> Yet for all their differences, the books that filled the Maze show that those divided by politics and prison partition were linked by a common thread - a need to learn and an abiding love of literature. </p> <p>In the days when books were still banned, Jackie McMullan managed to get hold of a smuggled copy of Robert Tressell's passionate defence of socialist ideals, The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. He read 100 pages before it was confiscated and had to wait five years to finish it. It has stuck with him ever since. </p> <p>Across in the loyalist block, Martin Snodden, too, had a book that had gripped him and stayed with him during his time inside - The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. \"The shared interests on the opposing sides have become clearer now they have left the Maze,\" says Richard English. \"And we see there is a human community around all of these people. They did some appalling things but there is a poignancy on all sides. The whole thing looks tragic and frankly rather futile now. There is just a terrible sadness to it all.\"</p>",

There is a wide variation in tastes.\" Yet for all their differences, the books that filled the Maze show that those divided by politics and prison partition were linked by a common thread - a need to learn and an abiding love of literature. In the days when books were still banned, Jackie McMullan managed to get hold of a smuggled copy of Robert Tressell's passionate defence of socialist ideals, The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. He read 100 pages before it was confiscated and had to wait five years to finish it. It has stuck with him ever since. Across in the loyalist block, Martin Snodden, too, had a book that had gripped him and stayed with him during his time inside - The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. \"The shared interests on the opposing sides have become clearer now they have left the Maze,\" says Richard English. \"And we see there is a human community around all of these people. They did some appalling things but there is a poignancy on all sides. The whole thing looks tragic and frankly rather futile now. There is just a terrible sadness to it all.\"",

      "body": "<p>\"In England, they think I'm dead,\" says Ronald Searle. This comes in the course of a meandering meal in his local restaurant in the mountains of Provence, where he and his wife, Monica, have lived for the past 25 years. He says it without rancour, but then the glorious views of southern France from this self-proclaimed \"village in the clouds\" do not readily permit rancour. It is just a fact, one that Britain's foremost \"graphic satirist\" (his preferred term), who is 80 this year, has gradually come to accept. </p> <p>Next week, Penguin publishes a collection of Searle's classic drawings from the 50s: St Trinian's, his best-known creation; Molesworth, that glorious collaboration with Geoffrey Willans; The Rake's Progress, a series of such significance that the British Library bought it in its entirety last year; and many other acutely observed, superbly drawn vignettes that established him as one of the key literary and comic influences of the 50s. But the tribute is double-edged: by focusing on the 50s, it again poses the question - what became of Ronald Searle? </p> <p>In reviewing Penguin's collected Molesworth last year, the London Evening Standard said he was \"living in retirement\" in the south of France. Again, not true: retirement would be another form of death for the workaholic Searle. Drawing has always been an obsession, and he hates the fact that a recent cataract operation is currently restricting him. He is as proud of the illustrations he has done for the Paris daily Le Monde over the past five years as of anything in his career. </p> <p>Britain thinks Searle is dead because in 1961 he left the UK to live first in Paris, and then, from 1975, in the village of Tourtour, Provence. His work now appears in France, Germany and the US, but rarely in the country of his birth, which, if it remembers him at all, recalls him as a madcap figure from the 50s, part of that zany burst of post-war humour that culminated in the Goons and prepared the way for TV satire in the early 60s. While it celebrates Searle the cartoonist, it ignores Searle the artist. Gags can be restrictive. </p> <p>\"Cartoonists are not given their due in this country,\" says Nicholas Lezard, in his introduction to the new Penguin anthology. \"They encourage condescension or scorn not only by the deliberate pitch of their art - calculatedly low, demotic - but also by the very fact of their often prodigious fertility, the way it looks as though they can knock things out, day after day. Searle's line tickles the boundary between cartooning and art.\" </p> <p>After 1961 there was less cartooning and more art, and Britain failed to keep up. The French gave him a major retrospective at the Biblioth\u00e8que National in 1973, and the French Mint commissioned him to design commemorative medals. The Wilhelm-Busch museum of graphic art in Hanover last year bought his large collection of books on caricature and his collection of drawings by artists such as Hogarth, Gillray and Rowlandson which he began when he was 14: it is creating the Searle Room, where his own work will sit alongside his collection. But Britain failed even to acknowledge his 80th birthday in March, though we do love his schoolgirls. </p> <p>Searle, who abandoned St Trinian's in 1953, seems resigned to being forever associated with the gymslip guerrillas. \"In a way I've got over regretting St Trinian's,\" he says. \"One reason I left England was that attitudes there were so parochial. People like putting you in a pigeonhole and, as far as the English are concerned, you are locked in it forever. All this mystery that surrounds me over why I left England is actually very simple: I felt stifled. I had been churning it out for myself at night and for other people by day. I was tired of hearing 'I want, I want, I want'.\" </p> <p>He has one powerful advocate in Britain, Frances Carey, deputy keeper of the department of prints and drawings at the British Library. She oversaw the purchase of The Rake's Progress, his mid-50s homage to Hogarth, in which he portrays the rise and fall of 16 characteristic types of the time (including actor, soldier, trade-union leader, politician, poet and painter). \"Searle's drawings are dependent on Hogarth, but every bit as brilliant and inventive,\" says Carey. \"He is a major satirical draughtsman of the second half of the 20th century. We have the greatest collection of British satiri cal drawings in the world - Gillray, Rowlandson, Cruikshank, Richard Newton - and Searle is in that great tradition.\" She says his influence has been enormous - notably on Gerald Scarfe and Ralph Steadman, but in less predictable quarters too. Matt Groening, creator of the Simpsons, is a Searle fan and in a recent TV programme acknowledged his debt to St Trinian's and the appeal of the dark side of its founder's imagination. </p> <p>Searle, while clearly not dead, is like a figure from another age: that inter-war period when the arts were not divorced, when painting, sculpture, music and literature were coeval. As well as working as an illustrator, he has produced sculpture, stage designs and animated films. In the 60s, when most of his work was drawn reportage for American magazines, he also produced the text to go with the pictures. One of his regrets is that he didn't do more photography. He has the all-round artistic facility of a Picasso, the magician's eye, and an unshakeable belief in his gift. \"He cannot touch a piece of paper without improving it,\" says Monica, who, clearly still besotted with her husband after a partnership lasting 42 years, may be biased. </p> <p>It is the self-belief that is really striking, and he appears to have been born with it. There was nothing in his background to suggest an artistic career. In Ronald Searle In Perspective, his 1985 collection of his own favourite work, he said he had no idea where his love of illustration came from: \"Quite suddenly I began to draw. I had been scribbling for ever. Now it took shape and I became, first fascinated, then obsessed, with what it was possible to do with pen and pencil. No one paid much attention to this, nor to the fact that the drawings were immediately grotesque. This was assumed to be one of the penalties for being 'cack-handed', local dialect for mocking a left-hander, which is what I am.\" </p> <p>He was born in Cambridge in 1920. His father, who had been gassed in the first world war, worked for the post office repairing telephone lines - a job that in the harsh East Anglian climate was eventually to kill him. His mother had been in domestic service in Ireland. The East Anglian background is significant, as Searle acknowledges in the brief memoir that serves as an introduction to Ronald Searle In Perspective. \"It was my good fortune that I got off to such a suitable geographical start. I had the inborn advantage of the eccentric, the abnormal seeming to me, as well as to most of those around me, perfectly normal . . . In addition, nobody suggested that there was anything ludicrous in the fact that, for the first time since the Searles had plodded their way through the bogs to escape the Vikings, a left-handed Searle was proclaiming that he had to be An Artist, instead of a gravedigger, or whatever.\" </p> <p>Searle has always been the outsider, the observer, detached from situations - domestic and social - and able to lampoon them. He joined the Labour Party in the 50s, but, according to Russell Davies's 1990 biography of Searle, came to regret it because it compromised his independence. He has sought to preserve his artistic freedom, even when that has meant killing off his most lucrative creations - the girls from St Trinian's, the Lemon Hart rum advertising campaign that turned him into a hot commercial property in the 50s when he produced a highly successful series of posters for the product. </p> <p>Searle started drawing at the age of five, and by 11 was producing highly proficient caricatures. He left school at 15 - he says he was hopeless academically but may be exaggerating - and took evening classes in art before doing a year at the Cambridge School of Art. He had cartoons published in the Cambridge Evening News and became illustrator for the university newspaper Granta, where he worked alongside Charles Wintour, later to be editor of the Evening Standard, and the historian Eric Hobsbawm. </p> <p>Though very much town rather than gown, the fact that Searle grew up in Cambridge was important in his evolution: as a teenager, already sure of his vocation, he spent hours poring over the Fitzwilliam Museum's collection of Blakes and Turners. It deepened his love of art, and he started collecting himself, using his pocket money to take the train to London and buy art books in Holborn. He received little encouragement from his bemused family, though his younger sister Olive was happy to be dragged round the Fitzwilliam. </p> <p>Photographs of Searle in the late 30s show a sharply dressed young man in standard-issue round spectacles mixing easily with Cambridge's finest brains to bring out the weekly Granta. There is no evidence of the deference that might have been expected from the elementary school-educated Searle. Again, his inner confidence, the unwavering belief in his talent, shine through the sepia tints. Hobsbawm, Granta's last editor before the war, confirms that Searle was one of a group of editorial equals. \"We all knew he was very talented, very professional, and he was accepted as one of the team. He had skills we didn't have, and was the only one of us who couldn't be replaced.\" </p> <p>When war broke out, Searle enlisted immediately, a perfectly logical decision in the anti-fascist ferment of late-30s Cambridge. \"Everyone had a very positive political attitude,\" he recalls. \"Everything was very black and white. You were anti-Mussolini; you were anti-fascist. When Chamberlain came back waving his piece of paper saying 'peace in our time' everyone started digging trenches like mad. No one believed it for one second.\" </p> <p>He joined the Royal Engineers and spent two years training in the UK, including a spell in the town of Kirkcudbright in Scotland, where he became friends with a local artist and his two young daughters, to whom he dedicated some drawings. The girls, C\u00e9cil\u00e9 and Pat Johnston, were pupils of a progressive school called St Trinnean's and a legend was born. Kaye Webb, assistant editor of the London-based literary magazine Lilliput, printed the first St Trinian's drawing in 1941, just before sapper Searle left for the Far East. (The real St Trinnean's closed in 1946, when its founder retired. Searle cannot be held responsible, though, according to Davies, its alumni were ribbed mercilessly about their alleged delinquency.) </p> <p>Searle's brigade reached Singapore in January 1942, just in time to witness the capitulation of the supposedly impregnable fortress to the Japanese. Searle, along with more than 100,000 allied troops, was imprisoned by the Japanese, and sent to help build the notorious Siam-Burma railway. The experience marked him, and everyone else who went through its horrors, for life. It also changed him as an artist: he had started to sketch army scenes as soon as he joined up, but now he had a sub ject that called not just on artistic ability but on his capacity to bear witness. </p> <p>\"I thought it was important to record what was going on, even if the drawings were only found later,\" he says. \"To know what it was like to have been cut off in the jungle thousands of miles from anywhere.\" He bartered with other prisoners to get drawing materials, and risked death to capture the savagery and squalor of camp life. He kept the drawings - 300 survived, though many rotted in the heat of the jungle - under the beds of prisoners suffering from cholera, because the guards were loath to enter their rooms. </p> <p>\"These drawings were not a means of catharsis. Circumstances were too basic for that,\" he says in To The Kwai - And Back, the collection of his war drawings, which was published by Collins in association with the Imperial War Museum in 1986. \"But they did at times act as a mental life-belt. Now, with the perspective and detachment that a gap of 40 years or so can achieve, they can be looked on as the graffiti of a condemned man, intending to leave rough witness of his passing through, but who found himself - to his surprise and delight - among the reprieved. </p> <p>\"When you are shut up in the jungle, your body is so disgusting that you can only live in your head,\" he says now. \"I remember when we were doing the basic slave labour of carrying stones from one point to another and throwing them over the edge, everyone was chanting nursery rhymes. It was stupid and banal, but it was a way of forgetting what was going on around you. If you had enough imagination to realise what was really happening to you, you'd drop dead immediately. One thing that saved me was a total lack of imagination.\" </p> <p>There is a much-told story that, while in the camp, Searle vowed that, if he escaped, he would drink champagne every day for the rest of his life. He does, indeed, adore champagne and drinks it as often as possible, but his love of it dates from his move to France, not his experience in the camps. There, he says, his dreams were reserved for a good, crunchy Cox's apple. </p> <p>In a brilliant review of Davies's biography of Searle in this paper, the novelist JG Ballard, who was also imprisoned by the Japanese, pinpointed his incarceration as the key to his bleak humour. \"In many ways,\" wrote Ballard, \"Searle's world reminds me of Max Wall - his twitchy clubmen and crazed headmistresses reveal the same ferocious impotence, and a desperate humour that has nothing to do with comedy. This is tragedy that has opened the wrong door and found itself on a burlesque stage with a few baffling props - a samurai sword, a schoolgirl's gymslip and a bottle of Lemon Hart rum. Out of these materials Searle has created a unique graphic universe, intensely English - though he might dislike anyone saying so - but enormously deepened by his years as a Japanese prisoner.\" </p> <p>Searle admits his experiences as a PoW have never left him, and have coloured everything he has done. \"When you have gone so low, you have a marvellous measuring stick. What doesn't matter is very visible. I retain my prison cell mentality and want to remain free. I've never really escaped from being in prison, and maintain contact with one or two former prisoners. The experience is so terrible that you can't place it in terms of compre hension for anybody who didn't experience it. With one - a simple farmer - we have a relationship where I phone him up and ask how his cows are. We don't have to talk.\" </p> <p>Emaciated and clutching his precious drawings, Searle was liberated in 1945 and demobbed the following year. Cambridge University Press published a selection of his PoW work, and he was propelled on to the London literary scene. He quickly began a relationship with Kaye Webb, his editor at Lilliput, who was five years his senior. In 1947, she and Searle had twins, called Johnnie and Katie, and were obliged to marry, but though they stayed together all through the 50s it was never easy. </p> <p>Searle believes this marriage of two egoists was doomed from the start. He was wedded to his art; Webb to her magazine work and later, even more passionately, to her role as editor at Puffin, the Penguin children's book imprint, which was phenomenally successful. \"I was married to a Puffin, and she was married to someone who was obsessed with drawing and didn't want to do anything else,\" he says, \"I'm not a family man at all. I realised that quite early on in the marriage. I married too young; I had barely come to terms with having come back to civilisation.\" </p> <p>Searle kept up a punishing schedule in the 50s: St Trinian's and Molesworth; drawings to accompany the theatre reviews in Punch - he would join the theatre critic, Eric Keown, in the stalls and sketch the drama unfolding on the stage; cartoons for the Sunday Express, Tribune and the News Chronicle; travel books with Alex Atkinson (the joke being that the latter had never visited the countries he was describing); advertise ments; animation for Walt Disney. He also designed the posters for the four highly successful St Trinian's films, but had no hand in what appeared on the screen and thinks them (Alastair Sim excepted) crass and witless. Where comedy is concerned, his preference is for the sophisticated and elliptical, and he thinks \"humour today is medieval, almost Greek: stick your tongue out, cross your eyes, fart - the subtlety has totally gone\". </p> <p>At the end of the 50s, Searle collapsed in the face of what was being asked of him. \"I was doing Punch theatre work, so I was in the theatre almost every night until 10 o'clock. Then I would get home and be drawing until two or three in the morning, even though I had to be in the office by nine. Suddenly I stopped; I was dead. I thought this is absolutely ridiculous.\" </p> <p>He also disliked the fact that he had become, thanks mainly to St Trinian's, too famous. \"I'm not a public person,\" he says. \"I don't like it at all. My work is public, that's splendid, but I don't want to be swallowed behind it. In the 50s I was absolutely engulfed.\" As the introduction to The Penguin Ronald Searle put it in 1960: \"Nobody hasn't heard of Ronald Searle; mid-century Britain is a Searle-haunted land. From the small girl who has stepped straight out of St Trinian's to the man at the end of the platform who is the fat man in the rum poster, you can't escape him.\" </p> <p>The combination of work pressures and domestic unhappiness made him move on. \"I waited until the children were 14 years old, and at least could be slightly more adult, and I packed my bag and left,\" he says. Not even Davies, who is sympathetic to Searle, can exonerate him for walking out on his wife and children (he left them while they were away for the weekend, leaving a note by way of explanation). Webb never forgave him. \"She wouldn't come to terms with it and wouldn't give me a divorce,\" says Searle. \"It also influenced the children's attitude towards me.\" Relations with the children did eventually improve and they made regular trips to Searle's apartment in Paris, where he lived with Monica Koenig, whom he had met on a visit for Punch in 1958. Monica was a stage designer who did some interpreting on the side, and she had been accompanying a reporter from French radio who was interviewing Searle and Keown. </p> <p>In 1967, Searle finally secured his divorce, and he and Monica married. Their mutual affection and delight in each other's company are immediately apparent. \"If you're stuck in a village with 150 people who only want to talk about sheep, which is admittedly a fascinating subject, you have to be on pretty good terms with the person you're with for 48 hours a day,\" says Searle. \"This is what we do and it has worked.\" </p> <p>They spent the 60s travelling the world together, doing reportage for US magazines, principally Life and Holiday. For the latter, the Searles made memorable journeys across Canada and Alaska, taking flights virtually every day and producing colour drawings in hotel rooms in the evening. Money was - indeed has always seemed to be - tight. Searle had signed over the Molesworth copyrights to the widow of his collaborator, Geoffrey Willans, and was handing over most of his fees to Kaye Webb to support his own children. He and Monica had a small allowance to live on, and came to depend on the expenses paid by the American magazines. They spent half the year in their rent-controlled flat in the centre of Paris (from which they were eventually evicted), and the other half travelling. </p> <p>At the end of the 60s, Searle's life again changed decisively. Monica was diagnosed with breast cancer and, almost overnight, the reportage work dried up. Colour television was asserting itself and the golden age of the colour magazine was at an end. They stopped travelling and bought the medieval four-storey ruin in Tourtour that, over a period of six years, they turned into their home. Monica successfully fought her illness, though its side-effects have lingered, and her husband resolutely supported her. \"He is a very forward-looking person, and always assumes that things will go well,\" she says. \"He has great common sense and a wonderful, insanely wild mixture of solemnity and lightness.\" </p> <p>Searle worked for the New Yorker under William Shawn and became close to its alumni - especially S J Perelman, with whom he collaborated on books. He did almost 40 covers for the New Yorker, but worked for them far less after Tina Brown became editor in 1992. He also drew for the New York Times and the International Herald Tribune, produced books of wine-related drawings, published his illustrations of Paris in the 60s, and started to draw crazed cats, snails, pigs, crocodiles and rhinoceroses - a confused, put-upon animal kingdom not far removed from that of man. </p> <p>Some find the latter too cute. Steve Bell, the outstanding graphic satirist of the current generation, admires Searle's \"individual comic style and exquisite draughtsmanship\", but thinks the animal drawings whimsical. \"The elaborate, jokey cat drawings do not test him, when in the early days he did test himself,\" says Bell. But the illustrator Posy Simmonds thinks that, when he wishes, Searle can still show his claws. \"He's capable of doing sharp political things, as he has in Le Monde,\" she says. </p> <p>Simmonds is a Searle fan, and exchanges letters, Christmas cards and books - always beautifully packed - with him. \"When I was a child I saw his ads for Lemon Hart rum and then St Trinian's, and I loved his drawings for Molesworth,\" she says. \"I thought he did the most wonderful pointy shoes. He is easily as good a draughtsman as Hogarth and Rowlandson, and his social observation is just as acute. He is a master and nobody can draw like him.\" </p> <p>Her long-distance friendship with Searle is characteristic of the way he conducts his social relations. Ernest Hecht, who runs Souvenir Press, has published Searle for almost 30 years but never met him. His London agent, Rachel Calder, has only encountered him once. He never answers the telephone and can only be contacted, via Monica, by fax. \"When I work I shut myself away and I don't want to see anyone,\" he says. \"It's not autocratic; it's just the only way of staying free with your work. I find work much more difficult at my age than it was when I was dashing around doing 50 jobs a day. I'm very slow now: it takes me a week to find the idea for a drawing, though execution is still quite quick - a day, or a day and a half.\" </p> <p>Searle is, however, a paradox - a gregarious recluse. Over lunch, in his usual seat at his favourite, Michelin-starred restaurant, he is animated and seems to enjoy recounting his life. With his beard and spare frame, he has the look of an ageing actor, and a beautifully modulated voice to match. His French, he says, is only passable. </p> <p>When Martin Amis visited the Searles in Paris in 1977, he wrote that he was \"greeted as if my presence were a key part of some rare and complicated treat they had long promised themselves\". They are indeed very welcoming, and appear entirely at ease. Yet they are still anxious to protect their privacy and their routine: they cannot be disturbed before midday; the name of the village can be printed but please don't say precisely where the house is. </p> <p>Searle's detachment is partly professional - the belief that the artist and satirist must retain a distance and protect his freedom. But there also appears to be some residual fear of people just turning up and imposing themselves. He dislikes people making demands on him: he needs to be in control of his work and his life. The house in Tourtour testifies to a passion for order: there are roomfuls of books, carefully sorted by subject; a huge video library of films and TV programmes; a magazine rack with all the latest English-language publications. All his correspondence is filed carefully into boxes, and he has a collection of nibs - annotated in minute writing - attached to a sheet of card on the wall. </p> <p>He reads prodigiously, watches the news in three languages, has his London agent send over all the books that interest him. When you consider the way he absorbs information, and the intellectualism of his approach, the fact that it takes him a week to conceive an idea and a day to draw it starts to make sense. </p> <p>It is the illustrations for Le Monde by which he now wishes to be judged, and he hopes they will appear next year in an English- language version of a book already in print in France. They are simple, stark and highly political: condemnations of political chicanery and double-dealing, corporate greed and global inequality. \"I love the work I am doing for Le Monde,\" he says. \"Producing gags and making people laugh is fine. One has done that forever, or tried to do it for ever. But at last one is applying the line to something that is of real value.\" It was worth waiting a lifetime. </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Ronald William Fordham Searle </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> Cambridge, March 3 1920. </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Cambridge School of Art. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1948 Kaye Webb (one son, one daughter) dissolved 1967; 1967 Monica Koenig. </p> <p><strong> War service:</strong> Royal Engineers 1939-46; prisoner of war Siam and Malaya 1942-45. </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> Punch theatre artist 1949-62; reportage for Life and Holiday Magazine in 60s; contributor to New Yorker, New York Times, International Herald Tribune, Le Monde. </p> <p><strong> Some books:</strong> Forty Drawings 1946; Hurrah For St Trinian's! 1948; The Terror Of St Trinian's 1952 (with DB Wyndham Lewis); four Molesworth books (with Geoffrey Willans) 1953-59; Rake's Progress 1955; Merry England, etc 1956; USA For Beginners (with Alex Atkinson) 1959; Searle In The Sixties 1964; Searle's Cats 1967; The Big Fat Cat Book 1982; Illustrated Winespeak 1983; To The Kwai - And Back 1986; Ronald Searle dans Le Monde 1998. </p> <p>\u0095 The Terror of St Trinian's and Other Drawings is published by Penguin next Thursday (\u00a37.99).</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"In England, they think I'm dead,\" says Ronald Searle. This comes in the course of a meandering meal in his local restaurant in the mountains of Provence, where he and his wife, Monica, have lived for the past 25 years. He says it without rancour, but then the glorious views of southern France from this self-proclaimed \"village in the clouds\" do not readily permit rancour. It is just a fact, one that Britain's foremost \"graphic satirist\" (his preferred term), who is 80 this year, has gradually come to accept.

He is as proud of the illustrations he has done for the Paris daily Le Monde over the past five years as of anything in his career. Britain thinks Searle is dead because in 1961 he left the UK to live first in Paris, and then, from 1975, in the village of Tourtour, Provence.

Gags can be restrictive. \"Cartoonists are not given their due in this country,\" says Nicholas Lezard, in his introduction to the new Penguin anthology. \"They encourage condescension or scorn not only by the deliberate pitch of their art - calculatedly low, demotic - but also by the very fact of their often prodigious fertility, the way it looks as though they can knock things out, day after day. Searle's line tickles the boundary between cartooning and art.\" After 1961 there was less cartooning and more art, and Britain failed to keep up. The French gave him a major retrospective at the Biblioth\u00e8que National in 1973, and the French Mint commissioned him to design commemorative medals. The Wilhelm-Busch museum of graphic art in Hanover last year bought his large collection of books on caricature and his collection of drawings by artists such as Hogarth, Gillray and Rowlandson which he began when he was 14: it is creating the Searle Room, where his own work will sit alongside his collection. But Britain failed even to acknowledge his 80th birthday in March, though we do love his schoolgirls. Searle, who abandoned St Trinian's in 1953, seems resigned to being forever associated with the gymslip guerrillas. \"In a way I've got over regretting St Trinian's,\" he says. \"One reason I left England was that attitudes there were so parochial. People like putting you in a pigeonhole and, as far as the English are concerned, you are locked in it forever. All this mystery that surrounds me over why I left England is actually very simple: I felt stifled. I had been churning it out for myself at night and for other people by day. I was tired of hearing 'I want, I want, I want'.\" He has one powerful advocate in Britain, Frances Carey, deputy keeper of the department of prints and drawings at the British Library. She oversaw the purchase of The Rake's Progress, his mid-50s homage to Hogarth, in which he portrays the rise and fall of 16 characteristic types of the time (including actor, soldier, trade-union leader, politician, poet and painter). \"Searle's drawings are dependent on Hogarth, but every bit as brilliant and inventive,\" says Carey. \"He is a major satirical draughtsman of the second half of the 20th century. We have the greatest collection of British satiri cal drawings in the world - Gillray, Rowlandson, Cruikshank, Richard Newton - and Searle is in that great tradition.\" She says his influence has been enormous - notably on Gerald Scarfe and Ralph Steadman, but in less predictable quarters too. Matt Groening, creator of the Simpsons, is a Searle fan and in a recent TV programme acknowledged his debt to St Trinian's and the appeal of the dark side of its founder's imagination. Searle, while clearly not dead, is like a figure from another age: that inter-war period when the arts were not divorced, when painting, sculpture, music and literature were coeval. As well as working as an illustrator, he has produced sculpture, stage designs and animated films. In the 60s, when most of his work was drawn reportage for American magazines, he also produced the text to go with the pictures. One of his regrets is that he didn't do more photography. He has the all-round artistic facility of a Picasso, the magician's eye, and an unshakeable belief in his gift. \"He cannot touch a piece of paper without improving it,\" says Monica, who, clearly still besotted with her husband after a partnership lasting 42 years, may be biased. It is the self-belief that is really striking, and he appears to have been born with it. There was nothing in his background to suggest an artistic career. In Ronald Searle In Perspective, his 1985 collection of his own favourite work, he said he had no idea where his love of illustration came from: \"Quite suddenly I began to draw. I had been scribbling for ever. Now it took shape and I became, first fascinated, then obsessed, with what it was possible to do with pen and pencil. No one paid much attention to this, nor to the fact that the drawings were immediately grotesque. This was assumed to be one of the penalties for being 'cack-handed', local dialect for mocking a left-hander, which is what I am.\" He was born in Cambridge in 1920. His father, who had been gassed in the first world war, worked for the post office repairing telephone lines - a job that in the harsh East Anglian climate was eventually to kill him. His mother had been in domestic service in Ireland. The East Anglian background is significant, as Searle acknowledges in the brief memoir that serves as an introduction to Ronald Searle In Perspective. \"It was my good fortune that I got off to such a suitable geographical start. I had the inborn advantage of the eccentric, the abnormal seeming to me, as well as to most of those around me, perfectly normal . . . In addition, nobody suggested that there was anything ludicrous in the fact that, for the first time since the Searles had plodded their way through the bogs to escape the Vikings, a left-handed Searle was proclaiming that he had to be An Artist, instead of a gravedigger, or whatever.\" Searle has always been the outsider, the observer, detached from situations - domestic and social - and able to lampoon them. He joined the Labour Party in the 50s, but, according to Russell Davies's 1990 biography of Searle, came to regret it because it compromised his independence. He has sought to preserve his artistic freedom, even when that has meant killing off his most lucrative creations - the girls from St Trinian's, the Lemon Hart rum advertising campaign that turned him into a hot commercial property in the 50s when he produced a highly successful series of posters for the product. Searle started drawing at the age of five, and by 11 was producing highly proficient caricatures. He left school at 15 - he says he was hopeless academically but may be exaggerating - and took evening classes in art before doing a year at the Cambridge School of Art. He had cartoons published in the Cambridge Evening News and became illustrator for the university newspaper Granta, where he worked alongside Charles Wintour, later to be editor of the Evening Standard, and the historian Eric Hobsbawm. Though very much town rather than gown, the fact that Searle grew up in Cambridge was important in his evolution: as a teenager, already sure of his vocation, he spent hours poring over the Fitzwilliam Museum's collection of Blakes and Turners. It deepened his love of art, and he started collecting himself, using his pocket money to take the train to London and buy art books in Holborn. He received little encouragement from his bemused family, though his younger sister Olive was happy to be dragged round the Fitzwilliam. Photographs of Searle in the late 30s show a sharply dressed young man in standard-issue round spectacles mixing easily with Cambridge's finest brains to bring out the weekly Granta. There is no evidence of the deference that might have been expected from the elementary school-educated Searle. Again, his inner confidence, the unwavering belief in his talent, shine through the sepia tints. Hobsbawm, Granta's last editor before the war, confirms that Searle was one of a group of editorial equals. \"We all knew he was very talented, very professional, and he was accepted as one of the team. He had skills we didn't have, and was the only one of us who couldn't be replaced.\" When war broke out, Searle enlisted immediately, a perfectly logical decision in the anti-fascist ferment of late-30s Cambridge. \"Everyone had a very positive political attitude,\" he recalls. \"Everything was very black and white. You were anti-Mussolini; you were anti-fascist. When Chamberlain came back waving his piece of paper saying 'peace in our time' everyone started digging trenches like mad. No one believed it for one second.\" He joined the Royal Engineers and spent two years training in the UK, including a spell in the town of Kirkcudbright in Scotland, where he became friends with a local artist and his two young daughters, to whom he dedicated some drawings. The girls, C\u00e9cil\u00e9 and Pat Johnston, were pupils of a progressive school called St Trinnean's and a legend was born. Kaye Webb, assistant editor of the London-based literary magazine Lilliput, printed the first St Trinian's drawing in 1941, just before sapper Searle left for the Far East. (The real St Trinnean's closed in 1946, when its founder retired. Searle cannot be held responsible, though, according to Davies, its alumni were ribbed mercilessly about their alleged delinquency.) Searle's brigade reached Singapore in January 1942, just in time to witness the capitulation of the supposedly impregnable fortress to the Japanese. Searle, along with more than 100,000 allied troops, was imprisoned by the Japanese, and sent to help build the notorious Siam-Burma railway. The experience marked him, and everyone else who went through its horrors, for life. It also changed him as an artist: he had started to sketch army scenes as soon as he joined up, but now he had a sub ject that called not just on artistic ability but on his capacity to bear witness. \"I thought it was important to record what was going on, even if the drawings were only found later,\" he says. \"To know what it was like to have been cut off in the jungle thousands of miles from anywhere.\" He bartered with other prisoners to get drawing materials, and risked death to capture the savagery and squalor of camp life. He kept the drawings - 300 survived, though many rotted in the heat of the jungle - under the beds of prisoners suffering from cholera, because the guards were loath to enter their rooms. \"These drawings were not a means of catharsis. Circumstances were too basic for that,\" he says in To The Kwai - And Back, the collection of his war drawings, which was published by Collins in association with the Imperial War Museum in 1986. \"But they did at times act as a mental life-belt. Now, with the perspective and detachment that a gap of 40 years or so can achieve, they can be looked on as the graffiti of a condemned man, intending to leave rough witness of his passing through, but who found himself - to his surprise and delight - among the reprieved. \"When you are shut up in the jungle, your body is so disgusting that you can only live in your head,\" he says now. \"I remember when we were doing the basic slave labour of carrying stones from one point to another and throwing them over the edge, everyone was chanting nursery rhymes. It was stupid and banal, but it was a way of forgetting what was going on around you. If you had enough imagination to realise what was really happening to you, you'd drop dead immediately. One thing that saved me was a total lack of imagination.\" There is a much-told story that, while in the camp, Searle vowed that, if he escaped, he would drink champagne every day for the rest of his life. He does, indeed, adore champagne and drinks it as often as possible, but his love of it dates from his move to France, not his experience in the camps. There, he says, his dreams were reserved for a good, crunchy Cox's apple. In a brilliant review of Davies's biography of Searle in this paper, the novelist JG Ballard, who was also imprisoned by the Japanese, pinpointed his incarceration as the key to his bleak humour. \"In many ways,\" wrote Ballard, \"Searle's world reminds me of Max Wall - his twitchy clubmen and crazed headmistresses reveal the same ferocious impotence, and a desperate humour that has nothing to do with comedy. This is tragedy that has opened the wrong door and found itself on a burlesque stage with a few baffling props - a samurai sword, a schoolgirl's gymslip and a bottle of Lemon Hart rum. Out of these materials Searle has created a unique graphic universe, intensely English - though he might dislike anyone saying so - but enormously deepened by his years as a Japanese prisoner.\" Searle admits his experiences as a PoW have never left him, and have coloured everything he has done. \"When you have gone so low, you have a marvellous measuring stick. What doesn't matter is very visible. I retain my prison cell mentality and want to remain free. I've never really escaped from being in prison, and maintain contact with one or two former prisoners. The experience is so terrible that you can't place it in terms of compre hension for anybody who didn't experience it. With one - a simple farmer - we have a relationship where I phone him up and ask how his cows are. We don't have to talk.\" Emaciated and clutching his precious drawings, Searle was liberated in 1945 and demobbed the following year. Cambridge University Press published a selection of his PoW work, and he was propelled on to the London literary scene. He quickly began a relationship with Kaye Webb, his editor at Lilliput, who was five years his senior. In 1947, she and Searle had twins, called Johnnie and Katie, and were obliged to marry, but though they stayed together all through the 50s it was never easy. Searle believes this marriage of two egoists was doomed from the start. He was wedded to his art; Webb to her magazine work and later, even more passionately, to her role as editor at Puffin, the Penguin children's book imprint, which was phenomenally successful. \"I was married to a Puffin, and she was married to someone who was obsessed with drawing and didn't want to do anything else,\" he says, \"I'm not a family man at all. I realised that quite early on in the marriage. I married too young; I had barely come to terms with having come back to civilisation.\" Searle kept up a punishing schedule in the 50s: St Trinian's and Molesworth; drawings to accompany the theatre reviews in Punch - he would join the theatre critic, Eric Keown, in the stalls and sketch the drama unfolding on the stage; cartoons for the Sunday Express, Tribune and the News Chronicle; travel books with Alex Atkinson (the joke being that the latter had never visited the countries he was describing); advertise ments; animation for Walt Disney. He also designed the posters for the four highly successful St Trinian's films, but had no hand in what appeared on the screen and thinks them (Alastair Sim excepted) crass and witless. Where comedy is concerned, his preference is for the sophisticated and elliptical, and he thinks \"humour today is medieval, almost Greek: stick your tongue out, cross your eyes, fart - the subtlety has totally gone\". At the end of the 50s, Searle collapsed in the face of what was being asked of him. \"I was doing Punch theatre work, so I was in the theatre almost every night until 10 o'clock. Then I would get home and be drawing until two or three in the morning, even though I had to be in the office by nine. Suddenly I stopped; I was dead. I thought this is absolutely ridiculous.\" He also disliked the fact that he had become, thanks mainly to St Trinian's, too famous. \"I'm not a public person,\" he says. \"I don't like it at all. My work is public, that's splendid, but I don't want to be swallowed behind it. In the 50s I was absolutely engulfed.\" As the introduction to The Penguin Ronald Searle put it in 1960: \"Nobody hasn't heard of Ronald Searle; mid-century Britain is a Searle-haunted land. From the small girl who has stepped straight out of St Trinian's to the man at the end of the platform who is the fat man in the rum poster, you can't escape him.\" The combination of work pressures and domestic unhappiness made him move on. \"I waited until the children were 14 years old, and at least could be slightly more adult, and I packed my bag and left,\" he says. Not even Davies, who is sympathetic to Searle, can exonerate him for walking out on his wife and children (he left them while they were away for the weekend, leaving a note by way of explanation). Webb never forgave him. \"She wouldn't come to terms with it and wouldn't give me a divorce,\" says Searle. \"It also influenced the children's attitude towards me.\" Relations with the children did eventually improve and they made regular trips to Searle's apartment in Paris, where he lived with Monica Koenig, whom he had met on a visit for Punch in 1958. Monica was a stage designer who did some interpreting on the side, and she had been accompanying a reporter from French radio who was interviewing Searle and Keown. In 1967, Searle finally secured his divorce, and he and Monica married. Their mutual affection and delight in each other's company are immediately apparent. \"If you're stuck in a village with 150 people who only want to talk about sheep, which is admittedly a fascinating subject, you have to be on pretty good terms with the person you're with for 48 hours a day,\" says Searle. \"This is what we do and it has worked.\" They spent the 60s travelling the world together, doing reportage for US magazines, principally Life and Holiday. For the latter, the Searles made memorable journeys across Canada and Alaska, taking flights virtually every day and producing colour drawings in hotel rooms in the evening. Money was - indeed has always seemed to be - tight. Searle had signed over the Molesworth copyrights to the widow of his collaborator, Geoffrey Willans, and was handing over most of his fees to Kaye Webb to support his own children. He and Monica had a small allowance to live on, and came to depend on the expenses paid by the American magazines. They spent half the year in their rent-controlled flat in the centre of Paris (from which they were eventually evicted), and the other half travelling. At the end of the 60s, Searle's life again changed decisively. Monica was diagnosed with breast cancer and, almost overnight, the reportage work dried up. Colour television was asserting itself and the golden age of the colour magazine was at an end. They stopped travelling and bought the medieval four-storey ruin in Tourtour that, over a period of six years, they turned into their home. Monica successfully fought her illness, though its side-effects have lingered, and her husband resolutely supported her. \"He is a very forward-looking person, and always assumes that things will go well,\" she says. \"He has great common sense and a wonderful, insanely wild mixture of solemnity and lightness.\" Searle worked for the New Yorker under William Shawn and became close to its alumni - especially S J Perelman, with whom he collaborated on books. He did almost 40 covers for the New Yorker, but worked for them far less after Tina Brown became editor in 1992. He also drew for the New York Times and the International Herald Tribune, produced books of wine-related drawings, published his illustrations of Paris in the 60s, and started to draw crazed cats, snails, pigs, crocodiles and rhinoceroses - a confused, put-upon animal kingdom not far removed from that of man. Some find the latter too cute. Steve Bell, the outstanding graphic satirist of the current generation, admires Searle's \"individual comic style and exquisite draughtsmanship\", but thinks the animal drawings whimsical. \"The elaborate, jokey cat drawings do not test him, when in the early days he did test himself,\" says Bell. But the illustrator Posy Simmonds thinks that, when he wishes, Searle can still show his claws. \"He's capable of doing sharp political things, as he has in Le Monde,\" she says. Simmonds is a Searle fan, and exchanges letters, Christmas cards and books - always beautifully packed - with him. \"When I was a child I saw his ads for Lemon Hart rum and then St Trinian's, and I loved his drawings for Molesworth,\" she says. \"I thought he did the most wonderful pointy shoes. He is easily as good a draughtsman as Hogarth and Rowlandson, and his social observation is just as acute. He is a master and nobody can draw like him.\" Her long-distance friendship with Searle is characteristic of the way he conducts his social relations. Ernest Hecht, who runs Souvenir Press, has published Searle for almost 30 years but never met him. His London agent, Rachel Calder, has only encountered him once. He never answers the telephone and can only be contacted, via Monica, by fax. \"When I work I shut myself away and I don't want to see anyone,\" he says. \"It's not autocratic; it's just the only way of staying free with your work. I find work much more difficult at my age than it was when I was dashing around doing 50 jobs a day. I'm very slow now: it takes me a week to find the idea for a drawing, though execution is still quite quick - a day, or a day and a half.\" Searle is, however, a paradox - a gregarious recluse. Over lunch, in his usual seat at his favourite, Michelin-starred restaurant, he is animated and seems to enjoy recounting his life. With his beard and spare frame, he has the look of an ageing actor, and a beautifully modulated voice to match. His French, he says, is only passable. When Martin Amis visited the Searles in Paris in 1977, he wrote that he was \"greeted as if my presence were a key part of some rare and complicated treat they had long promised themselves\". They are indeed very welcoming, and appear entirely at ease. Yet they are still anxious to protect their privacy and their routine: they cannot be disturbed before midday; the name of the village can be printed but please don't say precisely where the house is. Searle's detachment is partly professional - the belief that the artist and satirist must retain a distance and protect his freedom. But there also appears to be some residual fear of people just turning up and imposing themselves. He dislikes people making demands on him: he needs to be in control of his work and his life. The house in Tourtour testifies to a passion for order: there are roomfuls of books, carefully sorted by subject; a huge video library of films and TV programmes; a magazine rack with all the latest English-language publications. All his correspondence is filed carefully into boxes, and he has a collection of nibs - annotated in minute writing - attached to a sheet of card on the wall. He reads prodigiously, watches the news in three languages, has his London agent send over all the books that interest him. When you consider the way he absorbs information, and the intellectualism of his approach, the fact that it takes him a week to conceive an idea and a day to draw it starts to make sense. It is the illustrations for Le Monde by which he now wishes to be judged, and he hopes they will appear next year in an English- language version of a book already in print in France. They are simple, stark and highly political: condemnations of political chicanery and double-dealing, corporate greed and global inequality. \"I love the work I am doing for Le Monde,\" he says. \"Producing gags and making people laugh is fine. One has done that forever, or tried to do it for ever. But at last one is applying the line to something that is of real value.\" It was worth waiting a lifetime.

Cuban exile hip hop's unique selling point is that the rappers can also sing, chief among them Roldan. Dressed like a runner-up in a Shaft lookalike contest, Roldan has a voice - and looks - that would get him a job with any orchestra on any cruise liner he chose. \"This isn't a concert, this is a fiesta,\" he said, and the audience rushed to the front to shake its collective thing. Orishas have done a smart thing. Their music is shamelessly reliant on Cuban standards, which meant that those in search of authenticity were happy to nod along to the recognisable tunes, while the hip hop fans were more intent on the rapping and the subversive message suggested by Orishas' lyrics. \"Cuban music isn't a straight line - it's a circle,\" said the promoter in the interval. A neat diagrammatic way of explaining Orishas' blend of cha-cha-cha and ragga. \u0095 Orishas play the Shrine at Cargo, 83 Rivington St, London EC2, tonight. Details: 020-7739 3440.",

Most typically, that book is neither unspeakably dreadful nor mind-bendingly brilliant; frequently, its success will derive in some part from word-of-mouth recommendations and a slow-burn rise to prominence. Its fans will be staunch and legion, and usually it will be dismissed by the literary establishment as commercial or mainstream or insubstantial. No environment has proved so fertile a planting ground for such phenomena as what is loosely termed commercial women's fiction. <br> Rebecca Wells is so neatly illustrative of this process that Malcolm Gladwell used her \"runaway bestseller\" Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood as a case study in his book on the anatomy of mass movements, The Tipping Point . If Wells minds being subjected to such scrutiny she gives little indication of it on her almost neurotically positive website, which is largely devoted to communiqu\u00e9s to and from the various \"chapters\" of Ya-Ya fans - groups that have sprung up in the States from Alaska to Hawaii and on this side of the pond in the unlikely settings of Cork and Oxfordshire. <br> \"Summer dahlins,\" Wells addresses her cyber-sisters, employing the Louisiana argot of the book and continuing in its vein of breathless and much-punctuated enthusiasm. \"I can't BELIEVE it is the first of August!!!! Can y'all?\" Among other heartfelt confidences, Wells lets us know that she is \"almost HORNY\" to get back to her writing (a case of a little too much information, perhaps) and that, whatever is ailing us, we must never forget to paint our toenails. If you're not quite up to such direct communion with a woman who, to go by the chatrooms attached to the site, is one step down from Mother Teresa, you might instead look up a recipe for a Deep South classic such as crayfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, Bernice's Cracker Pie or Ya-Ya Cheese Spread. <br> Elsewhere, and in a deeply unwise move, Wells invokes the name of Flannery O'Connor who, apparently, laughed greatly as she wrote. From the liberal use of the word \"feelgood\" in connection with Divine Secrets and Little Altars Everywhere , readers might expect their fair share of belly laughs. The latter book is being published in Britain for the first time, although it came out in the States in 1992, where it became a cult - that is, it didn't sell all that well. It is a deeply problematic book, not merely on its own terms but also in relation to its massively successful sequel. <br> Divine Secrets focused on the psychological trauma of Siddalee Walker as she struggled to grope her way towards the possible happy ending of marriage through the unresolved detritus of her childhood. All she has to help her is a scrapbook of youthful paraphernalia sent to her by her mother Vivi, whom she has enraged by accidentally grassing her up as a \"tap- dancing child abuser\" in the New York Times . The novel unfolds in the present and, through the scrapbook and the memories of assorted characters, in the past. <br> Little Altars Everywhere has no such complicated narrative props, the novel proceeding through the accounts of the Walker family members in the 1960s and the 1990s. But most remarkable is the extent to which Wells radically remixed her original recipe to make the transition from minor cult hit to major bestseller. By the time we get to Divine Secrets , the dominant motif is that of friendship - of the bonds of intimacy that unite Vivi, Necie, Teensy and Caro - and its power to glide untroubled over the darker waters of family life. The dysfunction is still there, in the lengthily teased-out story of Vivi's breakdown, alcoholism and belt-buckle version of child discipline, but its potency is consistently diluted with Ya-Ya wisdom, recollected escapades, beauty tips and the picturesque evocation of Louisiana life. It is a study in tweeness. <br> There are no laughs in Little Altars Everywhere , nothing picturesque and very little hint that sisterhood cures all. Here, the tinkling of ice during cocktail hour metamorphoses into fully fledged alcoholism and the child-battering takes on the additional horror of mother-child sexual abuse. The Ya-Yas, who were later to become a group of mischievous, preening afternoon tipplers, appear as infant-abandoning drunks with Vivi as the leading Lady of Misrule. Her children are not simply sorrowful or bewildered, they are utterly ruined and turn into adults beset by impotence, weeping, mammoth therapy sessions and recurring nightmares. They loathe and fear their parents, and quite rightly. It is exceptionally hard to avoid the conclusion that these two novels, far from being companions, are at loggerheads with one another, but one thing is sure: Little Altars Everywhere is by far the better, and more honest, book. <br> One thing the two share is the language of pop psychoanalysis, a new form of currency in \"commercial women's fiction\" and one that is nearing a dangerous state of hyperinflation. The modern heroine must no longer merely seek a man, with or without the additional demands of career or perfect figure; she must also perform a psychological striptease for the benefit of her similarly afflicted but less vocal audience. <br> Like Siddalee Walker, one of the protagonists of Marian Keyes's refreshingly light-hearted Sushi for Beginners also boasts a troublesome mother. Ashling Kennedy, average in looks, intelligence and success, hits a worryingly uncharacteristic wall of depression when she encounters her comedian boyfriend having it off with her best pal. The reason? It transpires that she is reproducing her mother's own depression - the episode in Ashling's childhood that turned her from happy-go-lucky kid into coper extraordinaire, never to be found without plasters, portable sewing kit and emergency paracetamol. Keyes just about gets away with this piece of somewhat crude psychologising because she is a talented comic writer and because her novel is laden with characters, plot twists, jokey asides and nicely turned bits of zeitgeisty observational humour. <br> It is worth noting, however, that an essential ingredient of the feelgood novel is a king-sized helping of feelbad moments. Thus Sushi for Beginners also boasts a queen bitch magazine editor with a nice line in putdowns and control freakery and a faithless mother- of-two caught with her knickers down. Both characters elicit a good deal of our sympathy, which is part of Keyes's considerable appeal: her energetic, well-constructed prose delivers life and people in satisfyingly various shades of grey. She writes cleverly, without too many appeals to melodrama or mawkishness, and with plenty of realistic bad temper, disappointment and nastiness. \"This fucking country,\" fumes one character, contemplating her enforced move to the backwater of Dublin. Which is not a line you'd read as Rebecca Wells's characters prance across the bayou.</p>",

A bit like the nanobacteria found on the Martian meteorite a few years ago. The Quest for Mars confidently melds pop science with observational journalism, as Bergreen hangs out with the rocket scientists at Nasa and paints the geek geniuses as idealistic heroes, planning one day to send humans to colonise our neighbour. He leads us through triumph - the Pathfinder mission, in which a cute remote-controlled robot trundled around the surface of Mars sniffing rocks for a month - and disaster, when another craft was lost because someone forgot to convert pounds per square inch into newtons when calculating engine thrust. The most exciting findings so far concern the historical - and perhaps persisting - presence of liquid water on Mars. If life really has occurred on two separate planets in one entirely nondescript solar system, then it's far more likely that the whole universe is teeming with biological activity. Come to think of it, it's far more likely, too, that somewhere out there is a race of slender grey men with big black eyes. Spooky. </p> <p> <strong> Strategy of Deception</strong><br> Paul Virilio, trans Chris Turner<br> (Verso, \u00a310)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502445399,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> One wouldn't want to eat an entire plate of ripe Camembert every day, although it's a nice occasional treat. Similarly with the ultra-French conceptualist Virilio. Here he is again with a small but fierce volume about Nato's war in the Balkans. The problem, of course, is that a \"weapons ecosystem\" is \"capable of setting off the chain reaction of a full-scale cybernetic accident\". You too can make Virilio at home: mix equal parts Foucault, Baudrillard and Chomsky, add eight cloves of garlic, and blow up with two sticks of dynamite. Then start typing. </p> <p> <strong> The Ingenuity Gap</strong><br> Thomas Homer-Dixon<br> (Cape, \u00a320)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502132908,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> Modern society is ever more bafflingly complex, but the supply of human brilliance is not increasing at the same rate. Hence a widening \"ingenuity gap\" between our problems and our ability to solve them. Interesting if true. This large book is superlative on detail - there are excellent long passages about soil, finance, engineering, climatology, and so on - but annoyingly padded out with folksy autobiography and anecdotal travel jottings, and hazy on argument. Homer-Dixon warns that we have only limited control over very complicated natural systems, but no sane scientist would claim otherwise. And he demands that \"progress in the social sciences\" should speed up, without first demonstrating that any such thing exists.</p>",

The Quest for Mars confidently melds pop science with observational journalism, as Bergreen hangs out with the rocket scientists at Nasa and paints the geek geniuses as idealistic heroes, planning one day to send humans to colonise our neighbour. He leads us through triumph - the Pathfinder mission, in which a cute remote-controlled robot trundled around the surface of Mars sniffing rocks for a month - and disaster, when another craft was lost because someone forgot to convert pounds per square inch into newtons when calculating engine thrust. The most exciting findings so far concern the historical - and perhaps persisting - presence of liquid water on Mars. If life really has occurred on two separate planets in one entirely nondescript solar system, then it's far more likely that the whole universe is teeming with biological activity. Come to think of it, it's far more likely, too, that somewhere out there is a race of slender grey men with big black eyes. Spooky. Strategy of Deception Paul Virilio, trans Chris Turner (Verso, \u00a310) Buy it at BOL One wouldn't want to eat an entire plate of ripe Camembert every day, although it's a nice occasional treat. Similarly with the ultra-French conceptualist Virilio. Here he is again with a small but fierce volume about Nato's war in the Balkans. The problem, of course, is that a \"weapons ecosystem\" is \"capable of setting off the chain reaction of a full-scale cybernetic accident\". You too can make Virilio at home: mix equal parts Foucault, Baudrillard and Chomsky, add eight cloves of garlic, and blow up with two sticks of dynamite. Then start typing. The Ingenuity Gap Thomas Homer-Dixon (Cape, \u00a320) Buy it at BOL Modern society is ever more bafflingly complex, but the supply of human brilliance is not increasing at the same rate. Hence a widening \"ingenuity gap\" between our problems and our ability to solve them. Interesting if true. This large book is superlative on detail - there are excellent long passages about soil, finance, engineering, climatology, and so on - but annoyingly padded out with folksy autobiography and anecdotal travel jottings, and hazy on argument. Homer-Dixon warns that we have only limited control over very complicated natural systems, but no sane scientist would claim otherwise. And he demands that \"progress in the social sciences\" should speed up, without first demonstrating that any such thing exists.",

Gibson extracts far more convincing drama out of a more pragmatic approach: there is dirt and rain in his future, and the gadgetry doesn't always work. \"The future won't be some bright new thing which is somehow removed from everything that preceded it,\" Gibson has said. \"It will be made up of what exists now, with more of it.\" </p> <p>As an adolescent growing up in early 1960s rural Virginia, Gibson enjoyed \"five years of gobbling enormous quantities of genre SF, but then that was it\". He says he knew in his soul that he was some sort of artist, but thought his talent was visual rather than literary. \"But I knew I was a great reader. If you could make a living reading books, I would have been set up.\" </p> <p>He studied English at university (\"I read more D H Lawrence than I ordinarily would have, because of a couple of professors who were keen Lawrence men when that was still permitted\"), but it wasn't until he was in his late twenties that he realised writing was something he could do. \"Although when I look back at my early career strategy I wonder why I bothered,\" he laughs. \"I thought I would be extremely lucky to publish one novel as a paperback original in the United States that would then vanish without a trace.\" But, he adds: \"I thought that decades later it might have a tiny cult following in a single pub in France or England. A lot of the writers I admired - people like John Sladek - had had careers like that.\" </p> <p>His first stories appeared in \"very obscure sub-literary\" magazines. \"I gave them away rather than sold them,\" he says. \"I was terrified of being rejected by actual markets. But when I did start to get paid money for them, I was sort of stuck. It was the only thing I knew how to do at home on the kitchen table that was worth a few hundred dollars.\" </p> <p>Gibson hit the big time with the 1984 publication of his computer-hacking adventure novel, Neuromancer . \"It seems now that this book was published and immediately won all these SF awards and attracted all this acclaim,\" he says. \"But it was actually a longer process; the success was more of a continual surprise. I still think it's strange. It is as if one's first child had been a prodigy or something.

I hope I haven't done it much recently, but I'd hate to know how many times I've used the phrase 'wet neon'.\" </p> <p>Gibson's latest novel, All Tomorrow's Parties , has just been published in paperback. It is the final part of a trilogy which began in 1993 with Virtual Light - in which virtual-reality glasses hold the key to the future of San Francisco - and continued with Idoru , which was set in 21st- century Tokyo and featured a virtual celebrity. In All Tomorrow's Parties Gibson presciently called the bluff of the millennial doomsayers by anticipating that Y2K would be a non-event. \"Somehow the cruel part of me knew that the people who were going to have the hardest time on January 1 were the survivalists emerging from bunkers in Iowa,\" he explains. \"These people who had turned their entire net worth into beans and rifles.\" </p> <p>He says the book he's currently working on is, as far as he knows, a single novel. \"But I remember at the end of Neuromancer trying to pull the plug on any follow-up by including a line saying that the two main characters never saw each other again.

For the true story of psychotropic substances in the modern world begins on 17 April 1799, as a young Humphry Davy inhaled four quarts of nitrous oxide from a silk bag in order to see what happened to his brain.

As Jay puts it: \"This emergence of the effects of mind-expanding drugs into the clear light of science was both a cause and an effect of the birth of a new aspect of humanity - one which today we take for granted as part of our modern inheritance, but which in Davy's time was still emerging. To allow drugs into the mind in this way demands modern ideas of human agency, personality and responsibility; it both requires and generates an entirely new language for describing what goes on inside our heads; it holds up a mirror of self-consciousness which strips away the protective cladding of symbol, mystery and belief, leaving us naked in the keen air of the future, our inner workings visible as never before.\" </p> <p>That is as purple as Jay's prose gets; but it states with precision as well as poetry the nature of the drug experience, and hints at one of the reasons why (as Nick Davies put it in one of his chilling reports on child abuse last week) we live in a society where police departments around the world are far happier to share resources and cooperate on the matter of the illegal drugs trade than on the kidnap and sexual enslavement of children. For it is not just that drugs were once tolerated and now are not; he traces the history of intolerance and fear surrounding them, showing that reaction to the pharmacopoeia was gradual, confused, and plausible; the most plausible and damaging myth being that we once lived in a society without drugs and could return there if we had the will and the power.

(One test of this is how he treats the theory that Stevenson created Jekyll and Hyde during a cocaine binge. Some writers, in the face of no real evidence, assert it as fact, and it does seem as though it is on the way to being accepted as such; Jay just says that it is \"likely\". Which might still be going too far for some, but actually represents caution these days.)

Working-class purchasing power was to be reduced, inflation averted and war chests filled by compulsory savings. Treated with typical Keynesian aloofness, Labour and union leaders were outraged. The neo-pacifist had no feel for any war - but especially not for this one.

The product of one empire on the wane, he failed to understand the new empire's mentality, never grasping the dynamics of Congress and the division of powers. He couldn't lobby.

Skidelsky notes that America's third war aim after the defeat of the German and Japanese empires was the dissolution of the British version. In 1939-40 it mistook Britain for an opulent empire - one that had, moreover, defaulted in 1933 on its first world war American debts. Internationalist in trade when it had suited, in leaner times Britain had contracted into protectionism. America had made the same journey, but in an opposite direction. Now it wanted the abolition of imperial protection - both economically and politically. </p> <p>\"Lend-lease\" was the background to Keynes's failure. Roosevelt's shifty improvisation was a solution to both Britain's penury and American isolationism. America's loan of equipment would help Britain \"put out the fire\"; it would also edge America towards war since the transport across the Atlantic would be vulnerable to U-boat attack. But behind the offer was a Democratic Party dominated by immigrant communities who hated all empires - including Britain's. In return Britain had to accept limitations of both its exports and its gold and dollar reserves, meaning that it started the peace with the largest external debt in its history. </p> <p>Keynes was the negotiator of grudging loans to avert the financial Dunkirk that loomed in the war's second half. Justice mattered to him. It was important that Britain had suffered disproportionately during the war - but waving medals was a failure of tone.

But the keynote is pathos - that of a high-minded liberal unable to understand the gut-instinct hostility of a strange new world.

One midnight a man's voice was heard from the cellar, making those above believe that someone had come round from unconsciousness to find themselves surrounded by corpses. The cellar was searched, the bodies examined, but no living man was discovered. A few years later, in a Hamburg park, a voice was heard calling for help from a disused well. The police began to excavate frantically, but whenever they drew near to the voice it cried out from somewhere else. </p> <p>These were just two of the apprentice pranks played by the great 19th-century ventriloquist Alexandre Vattemare. He was a wicked student at the Paris hospital and a shady walker in the Hamburg park - in the latter case slipping away undetected as darkness fell and the frantic police carried on digging. Steven Connor writes of these incidents: \"Voices from holes, wells, cellars, sewers and chimneys testify to the dread of premature burial that would bubble up at intervals during the 19th century. The fact that these frantic searches for lost or locked-up children will always be in vain ensures both that the child (it is not always a child's voice that cries for help but it always has a child's helplessness) never quite dies (for its body is never found), but is never rescued either (for its body is never found).\" </p> <p>This, then, is not a funtime showbiz book: there is nothing here about the lime-green bird Orville or the doe-eyed yutz who spent his career with his hand up its (his? her?) jacksy. For which, Professor Connor, much thanks.

They show the ventriloquist's shamanic power to tamper with the apparent physical world. Vattemare's emergence in Europe came at a time when the ventriloquist had stopped being a subject of priestly opprobrium but was still a dodgy geezer at the margins of polite society. He was the untrustworthy, captivating man who met the demands of his audiences' other-worldly fantasies. No wonder, then, that Vattemare and his ilk prefigured spiritualism.

Connor finds other hysterical women and phallocentric men throughout this richly detailed history. Indeed, he considers - only to reject - the notion that ventriloquism started with possessed women such as the Witch of Endor who, like Vattemare, produced a dead man's voice for a credulous audience, this figure mutating through history into the male secular entertainer speaking through another's body. It would be an oversimplification to divide ventriloquism up between passive women and active men, and one thing Connor can never be accused of is oversimplification. </p> <p>Vattemare, who held European audiences in thrall during the 1820s, would even produce a nice joke at the expense of the etymology of \"ventriloquism\", a Latin translation of the Greek engastrimythos - en meaning in, gastri meaning stomach and mythos meaning word or speech. Instead of speaking through his own stomach, Vattemare would invite someone on stage and speak through theirs, thus combining two hitherto separate skills - throwing the voice and producing it from somewhere other than one's mouth. </p> <p>We are a long way here from the boring modern ventriloquist who balances a doll on his knee. \"Ventriloquism for us has become the art of making certain kinds of visible anthropomorphic object appear to talk,\" writes Connor. He is delightfully sniffy about such entertainers. He suggests that it is no wonder Ray Alan chose a sloshed aristocrat as his professional partner - Lord Charles's enunciation is easier to perform. And what's more, \"Let us be candid: all ventriloquist dummies, the ones representing the humans at any rate, have the same face ... garishly coloured, with flushed cheeks and high gloss, bright and fixedly staring eyes, a stiffly jointed jaw ...\" It is, in short, a parody of an adolescent boy (though one with a drink problem) with whom the ventriloquist (if he knows what he's up to) plays out an Oedipal struggle to sinister and comic effect. </p> <p>I was hoping for rather more on the uncanniness of dolls who come to life; the chapter on automata is perhaps not as spooky as it could have been. But otherwise this book is an unexpected triumph: I would not have thought that Connor, previously the author of cultural-studies works of an Eagletonian bent, could have produced such a well-researched, elegantly written, intellectually satisfying book. </p> <p>He throws his voice back through the past to a time when ventriloquism wasn't for dummies. Better than that, he encourages other voices - the phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty and the deconstructionist Jacques Derrida, among others - to climb out of their boxes and take over the narrative while Connor pauses, perhaps, for a gottle of geer. Refreshed, he returns to analyse these thinkers: Michel Foucault gets properly savaged for his misreading of Diderot's Les Bijoux Indiscrets , the story of a bored sultan who uses a magic ring to make women talk through their genitals and thus reveal their sexual pasts for his jaded delectation. It's not all about sex, Connor tells the monomaniac Michel, but also a clever philosophical disquisition on forced speech. </p> <p>The book's first chapter is marvellously off-putting (for those looking for nookie) and virtuosic (for those who care about the phenomenology of space and the metaphysics of sensual awareness). For Connor, professor of modern literature and theory at the University of London, is utterly engrossing on his central prefatory theme: namely, that nothing else about a person defines them so intimately as their voice. This is why the upset is so profound when one hears one's voice on tape and finds it thin, piping and ugly. Normally, after all, when one speaks aloud one is embroiled in a self-caressing dance of tongue, palate and lips, counterpointed with the pleasurable muscular rhythms of the breath being drawn in and released.

One midnight a man's voice was heard from the cellar, making those above believe that someone had come round from unconsciousness to find themselves surrounded by corpses. The cellar was searched, the bodies examined, but no living man was discovered. A few years later, in a Hamburg park, a voice was heard calling for help from a disused well. The police began to excavate frantically, but whenever they drew near to the voice it cried out from somewhere else. These were just two of the apprentice pranks played by the great 19th-century ventriloquist Alexandre Vattemare. He was a wicked student at the Paris hospital and a shady walker in the Hamburg park - in the latter case slipping away undetected as darkness fell and the frantic police carried on digging.

It's easy to see why readers thought he moved there years ago, his more than 50 books seeming to have issued from the pen of the love child (orphaned, of course) of Ivy Compton Burnett and Edgar Allan Poe. </p> <p>They are cautionary tales bereft of moral resolution - stories of gin-soaked children and pale-faced newborns brought low by nameless monsters, sudden fires and mysterious vapours. The titles set the tone: The Hapless Child, The Listing Attic, The Fatal Lozenge. Gorey always insisted they were aimed at \"reasonably small children\", and unconvincingly denied taking any morbid relish in their creation. They are, almost without exception, unspeakably funny. \"To take my works seriously,\" as Gorey once put it, \"would be the height of folly.\" </p> <p>The really morbid stuff all happens out of sight. Winding staircases vanish out of the frame; inscrutable objects can just be made out in the depths of frenziedly crosshatched shadow.

It's easy to see why readers thought he moved there years ago, his more than 50 books seeming to have issued from the pen of the love child (orphaned, of course) of Ivy Compton Burnett and Edgar Allan Poe. They are cautionary tales bereft of moral resolution - stories of gin-soaked children and pale-faced newborns brought low by nameless monsters, sudden fires and mysterious vapours. The titles set the tone: The Hapless Child, The Listing Attic, The Fatal Lozenge. Gorey always insisted they were aimed at \"reasonably small children\", and unconvincingly denied taking any morbid relish in their creation. They are, almost without exception, unspeakably funny. \"To take my works seriously,\" as Gorey once put it, \"would be the height of folly.\" The really morbid stuff all happens out of sight. Winding staircases vanish out of the frame; inscrutable objects can just be made out in the depths of frenziedly crosshatched shadow.

While Cole is Deck's favourite - \"proof that his blackness hadn't been completely blanched\" - he is nearly arrested simply for walking in the park with his younger daughter.

Deck falls into homophobic disdain for a friend who comes out after a lifetime of \"passing\" as straight; Birdie is befriended by a transvestite hooker. Sandy, too, has chosen to cross borders.

Sean, you see, is D M Thomas's son; had the Lit Rev been dispensing its little statuettes of half-naked women in 1981, The White Hotel's infamous bayonet rape scene might well have qualified. Rather more mundanely, Thomas fils drew his inspiration from hi-fi equipment, the winning passage comparing a woman to a Sony Walkman, but nevertheless, it caught the judges' attention. Less mundane was Thomas's acceptance speech, in which he revealed an previous liaison with the magazine - as a neophyte reviewer, he solicited work from Auberon Waugh, who kindly continued to send him books even when he was briefly detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure. </p> <p> \u0095 Jumping out of a cake to present the award was Mick Jagger, who admitted to a certain confusion over what exactly bad sex was. For musicians, he asserted, bad sex could only be defined as no sex, quantity rather than quality being very much the issue. The assembled company - a mixture of braying public schoolboys, vamped-up-to-the-nines publicity assistants and Michael Aspel - whooped with delight, having never been in quite such close proximity to somebody really famous. The Loafer's companion whispered anxiously that something was twitching at her right buttock; with a swift backward glance, we took our leave. </p> <p> \u0095 Continuing the sexual theme, a rather unseasonal gift - although who knows what arguments might brew over the brandy butter - arrives from Routledge, to accompany Castration: An Abbreviated History of Western Manhood. Whichever way you look at it, it's an offensive weapon, but the Loafer imagines it was originally intended for clipping cigars. One can hardly envisage how a razor neatly positioned over a small circle could be used for anything else. Top and tailing carrots, perhaps? </p> <p> \u0095 News reaches us of art lover Henry Sutton, whose tale of life on a jumbo jet, Flying, boasts a handsome aeroplane on its cover - the work of none other than Turner Prize winner Wolfgang Tillmans. Lucky, then, that Sutton didn't select one of Tillmans's other air-related images - a shot juxtaposing a penis and an in-flight meal. Ugh.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 One could have easily concluded that Bad Sex runs in the family when novelist Sean Thomas scooped the Literary Review's prize of the same name earlier this week. Sean, you see, is D M Thomas's son; had the Lit Rev been dispensing its little statuettes of half-naked women in 1981, The White Hotel's infamous bayonet rape scene might well have qualified. Rather more mundanely, Thomas fils drew his inspiration from hi-fi equipment, the winning passage comparing a woman to a Sony Walkman, but nevertheless, it caught the judges' attention. Less mundane was Thomas's acceptance speech, in which he revealed an previous liaison with the magazine - as a neophyte reviewer, he solicited work from Auberon Waugh, who kindly continued to send him books even when he was briefly detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure. \u0095 Jumping out of a cake to present the award was Mick Jagger, who admitted to a certain confusion over what exactly bad sex was. For musicians, he asserted, bad sex could only be defined as no sex, quantity rather than quality being very much the issue. The assembled company - a mixture of braying public schoolboys, vamped-up-to-the-nines publicity assistants and Michael Aspel - whooped with delight, having never been in quite such close proximity to somebody really famous. The Loafer's companion whispered anxiously that something was twitching at her right buttock; with a swift backward glance, we took our leave. \u0095 Continuing the sexual theme, a rather unseasonal gift - although who knows what arguments might brew over the brandy butter - arrives from Routledge, to accompany Castration: An Abbreviated History of Western Manhood. Whichever way you look at it, it's an offensive weapon, but the Loafer imagines it was originally intended for clipping cigars. One can hardly envisage how a razor neatly positioned over a small circle could be used for anything else. Top and tailing carrots, perhaps? \u0095 News reaches us of art lover Henry Sutton, whose tale of life on a jumbo jet, Flying, boasts a handsome aeroplane on its cover - the work of none other than Turner Prize winner Wolfgang Tillmans. Lucky, then, that Sutton didn't select one of Tillmans's other air-related images - a shot juxtaposing a penis and an in-flight meal. Ugh.",

One is Simon Schama's History of Britain ; the other is Richard Eyre's survey of 20th-century British theatre, Changing Stages. Both are in the great tradition: informative, unpatronising, capable of speaking simultaneously to the expert and to the novice. Eyre's programme in particular makes marvellous use of visual testimony: old stills, nostalgia-soaked clips, eyewitness accounts. It was fascinating to hear Arthur Miller admitting that the House Un-American Activities Committee would have let him off lightly if only he'd brought along Marilyn Monroe for a photo opportunity. </p> <p>The TV series, on the evidence so far, is a triumph. The book on which it is based, cowritten by Eyre and Nicholas Wright, is a bit of a baggy monster: a mix of the brusque and the brilliant that seems torn between weighty, cram-it-all-in reference book and opinionated guide to modern theatre. When the authors' sympathies are engaged or they are writing with inside knowledge, the book is full of bounce and verve; at other times it resorts to a breathless telegraphese in which key writers and movements are mentioned in hectic dispatches. </p> <p>Shakespeare, oddly enough, was better served on TV than he is in the book. On the box Eyre made excellent use of surviving film - from Beerbohm Tree's King John to Peter Brook's A Midsummer Night's Dream - to illustrate radical changes in theatrical style. In the book one is unnerved by a series of factual and verbal howlers. April 23 1916 was not \"the tercentenary of Shakespeare's birth\": he was born in 1564. Glen Byam Shaw did not briefly succeed Anthony Quayle at Stratford in 1957: the two men were codirectors from 1952 with Byam Shaw taking sole charge in '56. And what on earth does it mean to say that Olivier's Othello was \"a triumph of the actor as tyro\"? In my dictionary a \"tyro\" is a beginner or novice. </p> <p>As a guide to the past, then, the book is erratic. It's good on Brecht and Beckett, the twin pillars of modern drama. But the need to gallop through the century leads to some odd omissions and emphases. There is scarcely a mention of Galsworthy, although Justice led to a change in the law on solitary confinement. John Whiting gets a brisk paragraph but there is no mention of Saint's Day, one of the seminal plays of the 1950s. John Arden gets equally short shrift, with no acknowledgment of The Workhouse Donkey, a great piece of Brechtian political theatre. And while due tribute is paid to that maverick genius Joan Littlewood, it seems perverse later to claim that the post-Novello British musical lacked \"an indigenous identity\": not true of the shows pouring out of Stratford East in the late 1950s and early 1960s. </p> <p>Where Eyre and Wright score is in dealing with writers and directors close to their heart. There's a model section on David Hare dealing with the imp that is \"the unofficial, unacceptable part of the writer's psyche\": in Hare's case it is the emotional tyrant symbolised by Lambert le Roux in Pravda (cowritten with Brenton) or the overweening Tom in Skylight. Tom Stoppard and Alan Bennett, both of whom Eyre has directed, are also affectionately evoked: it is shrewd to see that the woman as truth-teller is a persistent Bennett motif, rising from the headscarved Mrs Swabb in Habeas Corpus to the prying Queen in A Question of Attribution . </p> <p>The book certainly gives you a sense of the vitality of post-war British theatre. One particular chapter, \"Last Orders on the Titanic\", pungently captures the smell and feel of the 1970s: the feverish politics, the rush of alternative companies, the excitement of discovering vintage Brecht down a back alley in Whitechapel and the sense that theatre was contributing to the national debate. As we get nearer to the present, the climate darkens. And even though the authors pay tribute to the latest new wave, they get the plot of Sarah Kane's Blasted totally wrong - it's not about a father and daughter but a tabloid hack and his abused girlfriend - and view the movement from a metropolitan standpoint: no mention of important Scottish writers such as David Greig, Iain Heggie or Liz Lochhead. </p> <p>So, it's a mixed bag: highly readable when the authors' passionate commitment comes through, but shaky as a panoramic guide to modern theatre. What one can say is that in an age of cultural relativism Eyre and Wright have an unfashionable faith in the medium. And even if their book is an overstuffed suitcase, it has provided the material for a first-rate series that proves television can cope with something more than cookery shows, quizzes and the exhausted dilemmas of cops and medics.</p>",

Will dress-down Fridays be replaced by dress-up Mondays? And will the internet finally deliver on its promise to let us work from home? Some of Rise 's favourite experts give us their predictions for 2001... </p> <p> <strong> 1. Work/life balance</strong> </p> <p> You've probably already heard rumblings about \"work/life balance\" since the government decided that something must be done to combat the legendary long hours and high stress levels of the British workforce. Next year, therefore, you might find your employer introducing measures to stop you working too hard. They may, for example, impose an \"exit time\", when you have to down tools and go home or offer you more \"time sovereignty\", where your hours are more flexible or you can choose to work from home occasionally. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Gimmicks</strong> </p> <p> With this in mind, we can expect to see more and more gimmicks in the workplace as employers try to lighten the atmosphere in the office, says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. \"Companies are going to try and do whatever they can to make work more fun and make young people want to come and work for them.\" Office jesters, lunchtime aromatherapy and even the return of the tea lady are just some of the things we could see in the office next year, he predicts. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Back to basics</strong> </p> <p> Employers often complain that graduate recruits lack basic workplace skills, says Andrew Parkinson of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. \"They've got academic ability but we're often told that they can't do simple things like operate the photocopier or construct a business letter.\" The coming months, he says, will see the launch of new work experience partnerships between employers and academic institutions to ensure that graduates leave university equipped to cope with the \"real world\". </p> <p> <strong> 4. Women at the top</strong> </p> <p> \"The glass ceiling hasn't been shattered but it's definitely moving up quite a bit,\" says Cary Cooper. \"We've become very results-driven in recent years and women have proved they can deliver. Women are also in demand because they're very good at helping other people to cope with change and today's workplace is constantly changing,\" he adds. Expect to see more women in \"male\" environments like the City and engineering. </p> <p> <strong> 5. E-learning</strong> </p> <p> Using internet technology for staff training, where materials are distributed to employees over the company intranet, will continue to grow in popularity says Jennifer Schramm of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. \"People can read it in their own time, sitting at their desk anywhere around the country,\" she explains. \"I think in future we'll see people blending traditional teaching methods with e-learning.\" If you join a new company in the next few months, your induction course may also be delivered by computer rather than a member of the personnel department, she says. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Interim agencies</strong> </p> <p> Short-term contracts, traditionally the preserve of the consultant and the older, more experienced employee, are increasingly being offered to more junior staff via \"interim management agencies\", says Professor Cooper. Even recent graduates can find work through these recruitment agencies, moving from company to company every few months working on a variety of projects. The employer gets youth, enthusiasm and the chance to test-run people with a view to offering them something more permanent. You, the employee, build up a wide range of skills and experience. </p> <p> <strong> 7. Bounty hunting</strong> </p> <p> Internet bounty hunting as a way of recruiting staff is currently being tried out by some American firms. \"The idea is that the best people for a job aren't always those who apply for it,\" Jennifer Schramm explains. \"So instead of posting your own CV on to a web site, your peers recommend you. If you get the job, they get a reward.\" Although it's still early days, we may see similar schemes in the UK if bounty hunting proves successful. </p> <p> <strong> 8. Right qualifications</strong> </p> <p> It's not what you know or even who you know that counts any more, it's where you studied that's becoming increasingly important when it comes to getting a job, Professor Cooper warns. So if you earned your stripes at an institution that's well-known and respected in your industry, expect employers to be tripping over themselves next year to sign you up. And if no-one's ever heard of your alma mater, think about taking a postgraduate qualification from a more prominent institution. </p> <p> <strong> 9. Simulations</strong> </p> <p> Online workplace simulations, where employees play at being their MD making big decisions or gamble on the stock market with imaginary shares, may also take off in the next few months. For the employees, playing a computer game is a bit of light relief during the working day with the added incentive of a bonus if you win. For the bosses, looking at how and why the employees play the game is a way of assessing what staff really think about the company. As the game is played anonymously, people are more likely to reveal their true feelings. </p> <p> <strong> 10. Web working</strong> </p> <p> If you really can't stick the rat race, 2001 could be the year you set up your own dot.com enterprise and make it work, says Andrew Parkinson. \"After the successes and failures of the past couple of years, people are much more aware of the risks of setting up an internet firm,\" he comments. \"I think we'll continue to see a lot of start-ups in the coming months but more long-term successes.

      "trailText": "<p>George Burley tells <strong> Jon Brodkin</strong> why his Ipswich are the big surprise of the season.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>George Burley is enjoying life, peering down at Chelsea, Leeds and Liverpool from third in the table. A smile flickers across the Ipswich manager's face. \"It's amazing,\" he says, \"at the moment we've got 27 points. We finished with that in our last season in the Premiership.\" </p> <p>The Scot hardly needs reminding that many expected this visit to be the same. What hope was there for a provincial club packed with local lads and cast-offs whose transfer budget was the size of Manchester United's weekly wage bill and whose biggest foreign star was Hermann Hreidarsson? What hope indeed. </p> <p>Fifteen games on, Leeds have been beaten and Manchester United and Arsenal held. Ipswich show no sign of bowing to the natural order. Having finally cast off the shackles of the First Division they have kept on running and no one is quite sure where they will stop. In Europe perhaps. That, at least, is the three-year plan. </p> <p>\"The chairman [David Sheepshanks] says if you don't dream about it you can't do it,\" explains Burley, named yesterday as November's manager of the month. \"I don't know whether it's realistic but you set goals and try to get to them. I was at Ipswich when we played in Europe nine years out of 10 [in 1973-83]. It's much more difficult for clubs with our finances to qualify for Europe than it was 20 years ago but that's our aim.\" </p> <p>Portman Road buzzes with ambition. A new stand is rising at one end; posters with messages such as \"Make it happen\" and \"Believe and succeed\" adorn the corridors, between montages of the great days of old - days when Ipswich were champions, when Burley was a full-back, when Bobby Robson had dark hair. Outside of the players' lounge is a reminder: \"You'll always miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\" </p> <p>Yet there is more than the power of positive thinking behind this flourish. Third place will be hard to maintain but the signs are that the success is built on more than a few good results. In the six years since Burley took over a side tumbling out of the top flight he has imbued not just his passion and passing principles but a fierce work ethic. The hunger is evident in more than the wolfing of sausages and beans at the training ground. </p> <p>\"Training finishes at, say, 12 o'clock and at quarter to one people are still kicking a ball around or practising free-kicks,\" says the captain Matt Holland, who will miss his first game since joining from Bournemouth if an ankle injury prevents him playing at home to Derby today. \"There's a big desire in the squad. A lot of us come from lower leagues and it's given us an incentive to do well at this level.\" </p> <p>Apart from the reserve goalkeeper Keith Branagan only four players - Hreidarsson, Jim Magilton, John Scales and Gary Croft - have real Premiership experience. Yet Ipswich have performed fearlessly. Just as Burley was hurled in at the deep end as a player, marking George Best at Old Trafford on his Ipswich debut, so a draw at home to Manchester United in the season's second match bred self-belief. </p> <p>\"I think the catalyst for our season was the United game after losing [3-1] to Tottenham,\" says Magilton, whose passing does much to make Ipswich tick. \"We played very well at Tottenham for an hour and I was frightened it might have been the same old scenario: newly promoted team does well for an hour and then the stronger side overpowers them. </p> <p>\"That was playing on my mind. But that game against United dispelled all my fears. We took the game to them. Admittedly they played on the Sunday and then had to play on Tuesday, but it was great for our lads to see they could match David Beckham, Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs and so on.\" </p> <p>John McGreal, signed from Tranmere for \u00a3650,000, and Mark Venus, a \u00a3150,000 buy from Wolves, are excelling at centre-back. Jamie Clapham, cast off by Tottenham after one league appearance, is being talked of as a solution to England's left-side problem. Marcus Stewart has enjoyed his first taste of the Premiership, scoring nine goals. </p> <p>\"If you look at Raul, he's a similar type of player,\" Burley says of Stewart. \"Raul's not the quickest but because of his football brain and his movement and his eye for goals he's very difficult to mark.\" </p> <p>The success is a tribute to Burley's ability to spot and improve talent, supplemented by a youth policy which has provided four first-team regulars, including Titus Bramble. The spirit is such that Burley plays golf with his players and three of the strikers - Stewart, David Johnson and James Scowcroft - holidayed together in France. </p> <p>With a full-time fitness coach this season any excesses will have been worked off fast. The players have individual programmes with strength, speed and agility closely monitored. Burley said he wanted an extra 10% from his players and feels he has got that and more. They are fitter and stronger, he says, working better as individuals and as a team. </p> <p>In a sense though, life outside the Nationwide is easier. \"In the First Division there was a lot of respect for us and teams set their plan to stop us playing, whereas in the Premiership teams want to play their own game and allow us to do the same,\" Burley says. \"That certainly has suited us more.\" </p> <p>During a high-tempo practice session the ball rarely leaves the ground. The players have been swimming and cycling to break the routine but much of Burley's work focuses on team pattern and basics, and since Hreidarsson's arrival he feels confident in switching from 4-4-2 to 3-5-2 at the drop of a hat. \"We're very repetitive in our training with the passing,\" Magilton says, \"and that's probably bred the success.\" </p> <p>On reflection, the play-off failures may have helped as much as they hurt. Each year Burley has felt the club get stronger, the habits more natural. He has built a squad which remains broadly settled, and it shows. </p> <p>As he prepares for a Derby boasting his midfielder nephew Craig, the 44-year-old accepts it will be hard to keep this performance level going. \"Just staying [up] would be a fantastic achievement,\" he says. Tell that to the fans checking flights to Barcelona and Milan. </p> <p>\u0095 How Burley's defensive partners have struggled as managers</p> <p><strong> Terry Butcher</strong> </p> <p>Two undistinguished seasons at Coventry at the start of the 90s were followed by a wretched year at Sunderland. Appointed in February 1993, Butcher saw his team avoid relegation to the Second Division by a single point. Despite buying five players for a total of almost \u00a33m in the summer, the following season was little better. It began with a 5-0 hammering at Derby and after six successive defeats, culminating in a 2-0 home defeat by Southend, Butcher was sacked on November 26. Has since worked as a coach in Scotland and in the media. </p> <p> <strong> Russell Osman</strong> </p> <p> Got off to an uneasy start at Bristol City in 1993, being confirmed as manager on the same day Andy Cole was sold to Newcastle. Abruptly sacked in November 1994 after a bad run, only nine months after signing a new contract and discussing \"a five-year plan to take Bristol City into the Premiership\" with the board. City went down under his successor, Joe Jordan. Applied for the Norwich job jointly with Butcher in 1995, before joining Cardiff in November 1996. Took them into the Third Division play-offs in his first season but was sacked in January 1998, with City floundering. </p> <p> <strong> Mick Mills</strong> </p> <p> Stabilised Stoke City after record-breaking First Division relegation season in 1985 (three wins, 17 points). Four mid-table seasons followed, but Mills was sacked in November 1989 after only one win in the first 16 games of the season. (Stoke duly went down under his replacement, Alan Ball.)

      "bodyText": "George Burley is enjoying life, peering down at Chelsea, Leeds and Liverpool from third in the table. A smile flickers across the Ipswich manager's face. \"It's amazing,\" he says, \"at the moment we've got 27 points. We finished with that in our last season in the Premiership.\" The Scot hardly needs reminding that many expected this visit to be the same. What hope was there for a provincial club packed with local lads and cast-offs whose transfer budget was the size of Manchester United's weekly wage bill and whose biggest foreign star was Hermann Hreidarsson? What hope indeed. Fifteen games on, Leeds have been beaten and Manchester United and Arsenal held. Ipswich show no sign of bowing to the natural order. Having finally cast off the shackles of the First Division they have kept on running and no one is quite sure where they will stop. In Europe perhaps. That, at least, is the three-year plan. \"The chairman [David Sheepshanks] says if you don't dream about it you can't do it,\" explains Burley, named yesterday as November's manager of the month. \"I don't know whether it's realistic but you set goals and try to get to them. I was at Ipswich when we played in Europe nine years out of 10 [in 1973-83]. It's much more difficult for clubs with our finances to qualify for Europe than it was 20 years ago but that's our aim.\" Portman Road buzzes with ambition. A new stand is rising at one end; posters with messages such as \"Make it happen\" and \"Believe and succeed\" adorn the corridors, between montages of the great days of old - days when Ipswich were champions, when Burley was a full-back, when Bobby Robson had dark hair. Outside of the players' lounge is a reminder: \"You'll always miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\" Yet there is more than the power of positive thinking behind this flourish. Third place will be hard to maintain but the signs are that the success is built on more than a few good results. In the six years since Burley took over a side tumbling out of the top flight he has imbued not just his passion and passing principles but a fierce work ethic. The hunger is evident in more than the wolfing of sausages and beans at the training ground. \"Training finishes at, say, 12 o'clock and at quarter to one people are still kicking a ball around or practising free-kicks,\" says the captain Matt Holland, who will miss his first game since joining from Bournemouth if an ankle injury prevents him playing at home to Derby today. \"There's a big desire in the squad. A lot of us come from lower leagues and it's given us an incentive to do well at this level.\" Apart from the reserve goalkeeper Keith Branagan only four players - Hreidarsson, Jim Magilton, John Scales and Gary Croft - have real Premiership experience. Yet Ipswich have performed fearlessly. Just as Burley was hurled in at the deep end as a player, marking George Best at Old Trafford on his Ipswich debut, so a draw at home to Manchester United in the season's second match bred self-belief. \"I think the catalyst for our season was the United game after losing [3-1] to Tottenham,\" says Magilton, whose passing does much to make Ipswich tick. \"We played very well at Tottenham for an hour and I was frightened it might have been the same old scenario: newly promoted team does well for an hour and then the stronger side overpowers them. \"That was playing on my mind. But that game against United dispelled all my fears. We took the game to them. Admittedly they played on the Sunday and then had to play on Tuesday, but it was great for our lads to see they could match David Beckham, Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs and so on.\" John McGreal, signed from Tranmere for \u00a3650,000, and Mark Venus, a \u00a3150,000 buy from Wolves, are excelling at centre-back. Jamie Clapham, cast off by Tottenham after one league appearance, is being talked of as a solution to England's left-side problem. Marcus Stewart has enjoyed his first taste of the Premiership, scoring nine goals. \"If you look at Raul, he's a similar type of player,\" Burley says of Stewart. \"Raul's not the quickest but because of his football brain and his movement and his eye for goals he's very difficult to mark.\" The success is a tribute to Burley's ability to spot and improve talent, supplemented by a youth policy which has provided four first-team regulars, including Titus Bramble. The spirit is such that Burley plays golf with his players and three of the strikers - Stewart, David Johnson and James Scowcroft - holidayed together in France. With a full-time fitness coach this season any excesses will have been worked off fast. The players have individual programmes with strength, speed and agility closely monitored. Burley said he wanted an extra 10% from his players and feels he has got that and more. They are fitter and stronger, he says, working better as individuals and as a team. In a sense though, life outside the Nationwide is easier. \"In the First Division there was a lot of respect for us and teams set their plan to stop us playing, whereas in the Premiership teams want to play their own game and allow us to do the same,\" Burley says. \"That certainly has suited us more.\" During a high-tempo practice session the ball rarely leaves the ground. The players have been swimming and cycling to break the routine but much of Burley's work focuses on team pattern and basics, and since Hreidarsson's arrival he feels confident in switching from 4-4-2 to 3-5-2 at the drop of a hat. \"We're very repetitive in our training with the passing,\" Magilton says, \"and that's probably bred the success.\" On reflection, the play-off failures may have helped as much as they hurt. Each year Burley has felt the club get stronger, the habits more natural. He has built a squad which remains broadly settled, and it shows. As he prepares for a Derby boasting his midfielder nephew Craig, the 44-year-old accepts it will be hard to keep this performance level going. \"Just staying [up] would be a fantastic achievement,\" he says. Tell that to the fans checking flights to Barcelona and Milan. \u0095 How Burley's defensive partners have struggled as managers Terry Butcher Two undistinguished seasons at Coventry at the start of the 90s were followed by a wretched year at Sunderland. Appointed in February 1993, Butcher saw his team avoid relegation to the Second Division by a single point. Despite buying five players for a total of almost \u00a33m in the summer, the following season was little better. It began with a 5-0 hammering at Derby and after six successive defeats, culminating in a 2-0 home defeat by Southend, Butcher was sacked on November 26. Has since worked as a coach in Scotland and in the media. Russell Osman Got off to an uneasy start at Bristol City in 1993, being confirmed as manager on the same day Andy Cole was sold to Newcastle. Abruptly sacked in November 1994 after a bad run, only nine months after signing a new contract and discussing \"a five-year plan to take Bristol City into the Premiership\" with the board. City went down under his successor, Joe Jordan. Applied for the Norwich job jointly with Butcher in 1995, before joining Cardiff in November 1996. Took them into the Third Division play-offs in his first season but was sacked in January 1998, with City floundering. Mick Mills Stabilised Stoke City after record-breaking First Division relegation season in 1985 (three wins, 17 points). Four mid-table seasons followed, but Mills was sacked in November 1989 after only one win in the first 16 games of the season. (Stoke duly went down under his replacement, Alan Ball.) Mills took over at Colchester a month later, but could not prevent relegation to the Conference. Subsequently worked with Butcher at Coventry and is now coach at Birmingham City. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>Len Shackleton was no clown. He was a serious footballer with a wicked sense of humour, which is not quite the same thing. </p> <p>All right, his autobiography was entitled Clown Prince of Soccer, and even at a distance of 45 years the page left blank to reflect Shack's opinion of the average director's knowledge of football is good for a chuckle. </p> <p>Yet the book contains relatively little humour and is more about the wrongs in the game, as Shackleton saw them, during the 50s. Directors, coaches and England selectors, they all caught the rough edge of Len's pen while managers were pitied as hapless victims of boardroom ignorance.

      "bodyText": "Len Shackleton was no clown. He was a serious footballer with a wicked sense of humour, which is not quite the same thing. All right, his autobiography was entitled Clown Prince of Soccer, and even at a distance of 45 years the page left blank to reflect Shack's opinion of the average director's knowledge of football is good for a chuckle. Yet the book contains relatively little humour and is more about the wrongs in the game, as Shackleton saw them, during the 50s. Directors, coaches and England selectors, they all caught the rough edge of Len's pen while managers were pitied as hapless victims of boardroom ignorance. Surprisingly, perhaps, referees got off lightly. Shackleton stopped playing in 1957 so only those in their mid-50s or over can have a clear image of what he was about. Nevertheless, most of the obituaries which have followed his death this week have rightly emphasised the player's willingness to employ his considerable ball-playing skills in the cause of entertainment. Not for the first time the modern spectator has been left with the impression that the game was much more fun then than it is now.

People in the front few rows happily returned the grins, but those further back found it hard to connect with this uncommunicative band. At the packed-to-capacity Empire, a lovely old theatre with three balconies, the audience is both significantly bigger and more distant. Lytle is correspondingly more nervous and slightly more willing to engage in inane chat. \"This is a biiiiiig place,\" he giggles, \"the biggest place we've played...tonight.\" </p> <p>They want to entertain: a troupe of people dressed as bears intermittently invade the stage; there's a charming film backdrop, scenes of fields across which cartoon ducks fly and strange mechanical bunnies leap; the gaps between songs are filled with the sort of chamber music you might hear in a tea room. But you can tell that Lytle is happiest when coaxing the squirling sound of a shower of shooting stars from his keyboards, stamping his feet to the rhythm, nodding violently as guitar chords spark off like fireworks towards the Empire's ornate ceiling. </p> <p>With this year's album, The Sophtware Slump, Grandaddy have created drift-off music of the highest order, songs that carry you gently through a bright blue sky into the unfathomable space beyond. There is a ruminative quality to the tales of lonely people far from home, very different from AM 180 and Summer Here Kids, bright and bubbly tunes from the previous album Under the Western Freeway. This show ends up feeling weirdly divided: the crowd is euphoric when AM 180 and Summer Here Kids are played, bouncing up and down manically, then droops a little when the brakes are applied for Underneath the Weeping Willow and He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot. </p> <p>The contrast makes you realise, though, just how much the band improved between those two albums. They still have a fine line in robust slacker anthems - the way everyone shouts along with the line \"I've lost my way again\" from the chorus of Crystal Lake testifies to that - but they are also capable of an elegance that is rare in indie guitar music. He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot sounds wondrous here, the spinning-meteor section in the middle so powerful you can feel the balcony rumbling beneath you. Dial-a-View and You'll Aim Towards the Sky, the swooning close to the show, are similarly rapturous. And the new songs, particularly the one weaving live and taped vocals, hint that the next album will be even better. </p> <p>Maybe Lytle has the right idea: you don't want too much talking, because that would just bring you back down to earth. </p>",

In fact, three members of the quartet have changed since Shostakovich worked with them around 50 years ago; only the cellist, Valentin Berlinsky, remains from the original line-up. Yet surprisingly it was Berlinsky's voice that was the freshest in this, the third instalment of their Beethoven and Shostakovich series. The Borodins have played these works hundreds of times, but occasionally during the first half of the evening it was all too apparent. </p> <p>Shostakovich's deceptively simple First Quartet is more powerful than some might think - he could already conjure up slightly neurotic images of wide open spaces and infect the listener with the musical equivalent of agoraphobia. The Borodins opened the first movement, rightly, without a ripple of expression troubling the flowing lines. But the promise of later turbulence was never realised. While a certain amount of detachment suits this composer, the first violinist, Ruben Aharonian, maintained an almost impenetrable coolness throughout - sections of the allegro final movement sounded more like a technical exercise than living, breathing phrases of music. Only Berlinsky injected a little lightness into the proceedings, wryly throwing out his glissandos in the first movement, more mischievous than grotesque. </p> <p>If the First Quartet can be unsettling, the Eighth is disturbing by any standards. Dominated by a four-note figure derived from the letters of Shostakovich's monogram, it's a shattering work, written in violent times and during a period of personal despair.

This figure has been revised upwards from the previous forecast of \u00a311bn, the financial services authority said. The bulk of this sum is compensation for up to 1.2m people. It exceeds the \u00a312bn that the government this week announced it will pay to millions of victims of a blunder involving the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps). Insurers and financial advisers have been ordered to compensate people who were mis-sold personal pensions between April 1988 and June 1994. Commission-hungry sales staff at many companies persuaded people to leave or not join occupational pension schemes but take out inferior personal plans instead. Others were advised - wrongly - to transfer money built up in an occupational scheme into a personal plan. Teachers, nurses, miners, firefighters, police officers and local authority employees were among the victims. Dozens of companies have been fined for failures linked to mis-selling, ranging from household names such as Royal &amp; Sun Alliance to small independent financial advisers. Among the largest fines were the \u00a3500,000 imposed on Britannia Life in July 1999 and the \u00a3600,000 levied on Sun Life of Canada a year earlier. Regulators began investigating into the scandal in late 1994 and this is continuing. Initially companies were told to concentrate on reviewing the 700,000 \"priority\" cases: people who had retired or were close to retirement. Two months after coming to power in 1997, the Labour government started publishing monthly figures showing how the 41 worst-offending pension companies were doing in compensating victims. This naming and shaming approach continued until February 1999 when the last of the firms met government targets. More than 98% of priority cases have been reviewed and almost \u00a33.6bn in compensation has been paid to 406,000 people - an average of \u00a38,800 each - in the form of pension funds contributions. In January 1999 phase two of the investigation began, focusing on younger people, typically in their 30s and 40s, who might have been mis-sold a pension. It was thought up to 2m in this age group might have been affected, and the FSA said yesterday that of the 1.2m people who have so far asked for their cases to be reviewed 872,000 are potentially in line for compensation. The \u00a313.5bn total includes \u00a34bn likely to be paid out to the priority cases, \u00a37.5bn compensation to younger victims and \u00a32bn administration costs, the whole to be met by insurers and financial advisers. The increase partly reflects \"the change in financial conditions\" since early 1998 when the \u00a311bn figure was disclosed, the FSA said. Last year the actuarial profession issued figures showing that people are living longer, and this has pushed up the costs because pensions will be paid for longer. Pension companies have until June 30 2002 to resolve all cases. By then every suspected victim should have received a letter stating how the company proposes to compensate the policyholder for any loss, or that the individual is not due any compensation.",

It might also be the first production at the Coliseum in which the orchestra and conductor spend more time on stage than most of the singers. </p> <p>In the shadow of recent sickening images from the Middle East, David Pountney's loosely modern-dress staging of this story of the struggle between the Jews and Babylonians takes on extra resonance. Pountney presents it as an almost epic fable, with a huge piece of Hebrew script hanging above the stage, and lines from the Bible recited by three schoolboys, in English and Hebrew, introducing each of the four parts. </p> <p>In many ways it seems that Stefanos Lazaridis's designs for the Italian season have reached their natural culmination. Over the course of the autumn the auditorium has been filling up with odd props and features left behind after each production. And the scaffolding that has long surrounded the dress circle has now encroached on to the stage and joins in the middle. </p> <p>In fact, in the same way that Lazaridis has been deconstructing our cosy image of an opera house, in this production we have most of the illusion of opera stripped away. Nothing is hidden. The workings of opera are turned inside out. The massed, khaki-costumed ranks of the orchestra are on stage throughout, and Nabucco himself is very much visible even before his first entrance. </p> <p>The shirt-sleeved conductor Michael Lloyd starts off on stage and, with his singers making much use of the scaffolding runway, frequently returns there, moving around in order to communicate with them - though he absents himself for Zaccaria's monologue, leaving the handful of accompanying cellists to play as a chamber group. </p> <p>This production features the British debut of the American soprano Lauren Flanigan, who sings the anti-heroine Abigaille. Flanigan's voice is striking - not for its acrobatic agility, nor for an unusual amount of beauty or warmth, nor for her rather cloudy diction, but rather because of its compelling dramatic power and ability to convey feeling. Another auspicious debut comes from the baritone Bruno Caproni, singing his first Nabucco - finely judged, rich and communicative. Indeed, there is no weak link in a cast that also includes Alastair Miles as Zaccaria, John Daszak as Ismaele and Anne Mason as Fenena. The chorus is on fine form, and the orchestra plays sensitively. The players' movements may be the visual equivalent of background noise but, if one can get past that, this Nabucco is an unusual and rewarding operatic experience. </p> <p> In repertory until February 23.

      "body": "<p>Buying and selling shares has never been easier or cheaper now that several stockbrokers offer online dealing services. Most sites give real-time pricing and stock price alerts, so you can take action when shares reach levels you think significant. </p> <p>The are other advantages: lower commissions; not worrying about engaged phone lines; huge volumes of research and other background information; and not having to stick with the 8am-to-4pm London stock exchange opening times. Dealing out of hours allows stocks to be bought or sold at the next day's opening price. </p> <p>But online broking is not for the novice investor, whatever the brokers may claim. While traditional stockbrokers can supply buy and sell recommendations, online broking is an execution-only service. </p> <p>And it is all too easy to press the buttons and deal without thinking seriously of the consequences; there is no cooling-off period. Even phone-based brokers would raise a few eyebrows if someone dealt 50 or 100 times a day. </p> <p>Yet there has been a surge in online dealing, with around 15% of all private share trading now carried out through one of the UK's 25 online broking sites. </p> <p>But with such a smorgasbord of online brokers scrambling for business, the challenge is determining which broker best suits your needs. Comparing charges is rarely straightforward. The only similarity is that all share purchases are subject to 0.5% stamp duty. </p> <p>Some dealers charge an establishment fee, while others zap you with an annual management charge. All charge commission, but some increase this according to the size of the transaction. </p> <p>A number of brokers also hold out special deals to lure new investors. Charles Schwab offers free dealing for the first 30 days of opening an account and DLJdirect promises trades with a flat \u00a35 commission for the first 50 days. </p> <p>Investors making smaller punts should look to online brokers whose commissions are cheaper at the lower end of the transaction scale. </p> <p>The Share Centre, for example, charges just 1% commission, with the minimum charge being \u00a32.50.

      "bodyText": "Buying and selling shares has never been easier or cheaper now that several stockbrokers offer online dealing services. Most sites give real-time pricing and stock price alerts, so you can take action when shares reach levels you think significant. The are other advantages: lower commissions; not worrying about engaged phone lines; huge volumes of research and other background information; and not having to stick with the 8am-to-4pm London stock exchange opening times. Dealing out of hours allows stocks to be bought or sold at the next day's opening price. But online broking is not for the novice investor, whatever the brokers may claim. While traditional stockbrokers can supply buy and sell recommendations, online broking is an execution-only service. And it is all too easy to press the buttons and deal without thinking seriously of the consequences; there is no cooling-off period. Even phone-based brokers would raise a few eyebrows if someone dealt 50 or 100 times a day. Yet there has been a surge in online dealing, with around 15% of all private share trading now carried out through one of the UK's 25 online broking sites. But with such a smorgasbord of online brokers scrambling for business, the challenge is determining which broker best suits your needs. Comparing charges is rarely straightforward. The only similarity is that all share purchases are subject to 0.5% stamp duty. Some dealers charge an establishment fee, while others zap you with an annual management charge. All charge commission, but some increase this according to the size of the transaction. A number of brokers also hold out special deals to lure new investors. Charles Schwab offers free dealing for the first 30 days of opening an account and DLJdirect promises trades with a flat \u00a35 commission for the first 50 days. Investors making smaller punts should look to online brokers whose commissions are cheaper at the lower end of the transaction scale. The Share Centre, for example, charges just 1% commission, with the minimum charge being \u00a32.50. There is no establishment fee, but an administration fee of \u00a35 for every transaction is charged. But the Share Centre is not for larger transactions, which can involve \u00a3250 in commission for a \u00a325,000 trade. The same transaction would cost as little as \u00a39.95 with Hargreaves Lansdown, or \u00a310 with idealing.com, which both charge flat fees. Other brokers to charge flat fees include Stockacademy (\u00a315), Sharepeople (\u00a317.50), James Brearley (\u00a320) and Xest (\u00a320). The downside is that these sites levy annual administration charges, though these are easily swallowed up by frequent trades. The lowest of the annual administration charges is at idealing.com, which charges \u00a320, followed by James Brearley (\u00a325 plus VAT), Stock Academy (\u00a340 plus VAT), Sharepeople (\u00a342.56) Hargreaves Lansdown (\u00a350) and Xest (\u00a320 set-up and \u00a345 annual administration). An attractive site is Self Trade, which charges a \u00a312.50 flat commission fee, without set-up or annual charges. Halifax Share Xpress offers a similar deal. With so many sites on offer, it has become a business in itself contrasting costs and services of the online brokers. One site that does this is Investment Gateway, which also offers links to individual brokers.",

      "body": "<p>The marketing material for Dmitri Hvorostovsky's latest recital is anything but subtle. Emblazoned on both poster and programme cover, we find the phrase \"Russian romance\". Given that the accompanying photograph shows the handsome Siberian baritone in a flowing open-necked shirt and looking pensively Byronic, one might easily be forgiven for thinking that this is yet another plug for his sex symbol status. In fact, it refers to his programme of love songs by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, most of which are settings of works by poets unfamiliar in Western Europe. </p> <p>The programme is extremely tricky, for there's a certain sameness of mood and imagery in much of the material that Hvorostovsky has chosen. Most of the songs deal with the sadness of separation, the pain and bitterness of emotional loss, the mournful nostalgia for a vanished past. The texts are riddled with forests and nightingales, sultry summer nights and other peoples' love songs. It's the kind of line-up that could easily become cloying when performed by a lesser artist, and it's a measure of Hvorostovsky's genius that we experience not a flicker of tedium throughout and that the emotional range of the evening comes over as being astonishingly wide. </p> <p>Each song is given a uniquely pertinent characterisation. Tchaikovsky's Fearful Moment has a lover presenting his mistress with an ultimatum. Hvorostovsky delivers it with an edgy defensiveness, and the witty emotional insecurity of Tchaikovsky's own Onegin. The \"sad songs of Georgia\" that haunt Rachmaninov's famous setting of Pushkin usually provoke singers to the delivery of dreamy melismas, but here the vocal line is pushed closer to an anguished wail. The dominant tone of self-pity is sometimes broken by a redefinition of love in terms of spirituality or carnality. </p> <p>Rachmaninov lurches into Dostoevskyan territory with Christ is Risen and He Has Taken All from Me, in which sexual and mystical suffering are morbidly equated. Hvorostovsky vocally writhes through both songs with almost manic ferocity. He gives us two very contrasting portraits of Don Juan, the serenades by Tchaikovsky and Mozart, the latter from Don Giovanni, offered as an encore. He turns Tchaikovsky's seducer into a cold sadist, hectoring a response from his mistress, while the accompaniment, flawlessly played by Mikhail Arkadiev, swirls beneath him in demonic pointillism. Mozart's Don, by contrast, has an erotic blatancy that just makes you go weak at the knees. </p> <p>Hvorostovsky ends his recital about love ironically, with another encore that forms the ultimate musical embodiment of lovelessness, namely Iago's Creed from Verdi's Otello. Its blasphemous horror and nihilistic wit are offset by the sheer beauty of his singing. His voice, powerful, velvety and sinuous, remains a thing of wonder. He can pack a house on artistry alone, rendering sexy marketing ploys redundant.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The marketing material for Dmitri Hvorostovsky's latest recital is anything but subtle. Emblazoned on both poster and programme cover, we find the phrase \"Russian romance\". Given that the accompanying photograph shows the handsome Siberian baritone in a flowing open-necked shirt and looking pensively Byronic, one might easily be forgiven for thinking that this is yet another plug for his sex symbol status. In fact, it refers to his programme of love songs by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, most of which are settings of works by poets unfamiliar in Western Europe. The programme is extremely tricky, for there's a certain sameness of mood and imagery in much of the material that Hvorostovsky has chosen. Most of the songs deal with the sadness of separation, the pain and bitterness of emotional loss, the mournful nostalgia for a vanished past. The texts are riddled with forests and nightingales, sultry summer nights and other peoples' love songs. It's the kind of line-up that could easily become cloying when performed by a lesser artist, and it's a measure of Hvorostovsky's genius that we experience not a flicker of tedium throughout and that the emotional range of the evening comes over as being astonishingly wide. Each song is given a uniquely pertinent characterisation. Tchaikovsky's Fearful Moment has a lover presenting his mistress with an ultimatum. Hvorostovsky delivers it with an edgy defensiveness, and the witty emotional insecurity of Tchaikovsky's own Onegin. The \"sad songs of Georgia\" that haunt Rachmaninov's famous setting of Pushkin usually provoke singers to the delivery of dreamy melismas, but here the vocal line is pushed closer to an anguished wail. The dominant tone of self-pity is sometimes broken by a redefinition of love in terms of spirituality or carnality. Rachmaninov lurches into Dostoevskyan territory with Christ is Risen and He Has Taken All from Me, in which sexual and mystical suffering are morbidly equated. Hvorostovsky vocally writhes through both songs with almost manic ferocity. He gives us two very contrasting portraits of Don Juan, the serenades by Tchaikovsky and Mozart, the latter from Don Giovanni, offered as an encore. He turns Tchaikovsky's seducer into a cold sadist, hectoring a response from his mistress, while the accompaniment, flawlessly played by Mikhail Arkadiev, swirls beneath him in demonic pointillism. Mozart's Don, by contrast, has an erotic blatancy that just makes you go weak at the knees. Hvorostovsky ends his recital about love ironically, with another encore that forms the ultimate musical embodiment of lovelessness, namely Iago's Creed from Verdi's Otello. Its blasphemous horror and nihilistic wit are offset by the sheer beauty of his singing. His voice, powerful, velvety and sinuous, remains a thing of wonder. He can pack a house on artistry alone, rendering sexy marketing ploys redundant.",

But although this 50-minute play about a descent into the dark ages' shocks and surprises, it moves from the real to the surreal in ways I found less than convincing. </p> <p>The first scene, however, is a model of dramatic writing - one in which Churchill ratchets up the tension line by line. We are somewhere in the countryside: to judge by Ian MacNeil's front-cloth, with its soft undulations, one assumes it to be England. But it is night and a young girl, Joan, is questioning the aunt with whom she is staying. Joan, it seems, has crept out of the house on hearing a shriek. The aunt tries to provide rational explanations. She says the cry came from an owl, only for Joan to retort, \"It was more like a person screaming.\" Gradually, we realise that the child has witnessed an act of horror involving lorries, blood, the battering of children. </p> <p>Imagine The Secret Garden rewritten by Pinter and you get some idea of the power of this first scene. It has much to do with the young girl's remorseless interrogation; also with the fear that children, as well as being victims of violence, are corrupted by implication in it. But Annabelle Seymour-Julen's remarkably level gaze as Joan, Linda Bassett's stonewalling defensiveness as the aunt and Daldry's use of something as simple as a light switched off and on add to the sense of prickly unease. </p> <p>Thereafter the tension eases slightly. We watch the older Joan and a male colleague making exotic hats in a tyrannised factory: not, we discover, for a fashion show but for a grisly parade. And we end up with a vision of a planet consumed by conflict in which not merely every country is enlisted but also every species of animal and even the elements themselves. It is apocalyptic and unnerving but the journey from the farmhouse reality of the first scene to the cosmic chaos of the last is too swift to be dramatically convincing. It reminds me, if anything, of Sarah Kane's Blasted, which I know Churchill admired but which strikes me as a questionable prototype. </p> <p>Churchill's best effects are achieved through the sudden injection of shock words that set off seismic disturbances. Daldry's production and McNeil's design also typically achieve epic effects in a tiny space, not least when a small army of manacled prisoners is paraded across the stage. And, in the hat-making scene, Katherine Tozer as the older Joan and Kevin McKidd as her partner marvellously counterpoint growing emotion with the physical action of stretching, teasing and steam-pressing their milliners' cloth. </p> <p>The evening constantly astonishes. But, while I am prepared to accept Churchill's thesis that we are slowly sliding into barbarism, I would prefer the case to be argued rather than presented as a dramatic given. </p> <p> Until December 22.

Knock! Knock! Who's There? is a touchy-feely, scratch-and-sniff, storytelling performance for the under-fives and their carers. It is a total delight and I can't wait until Oily Cart get round to doing shows for the over-30s. It is not often that theatre makes you feel blissed out. But this miniature does, in part because the audience - small though it is in every way - is made to feel an active participant. </p> <p>First you are offered a flowered apron and hat, and then ushered into an indoors autumnal garden that is like a glorious playground of the senses. Topiary sits side by side with a pop-up scarecrow, rows of chattering crows, a watering can that spills its contents over plump, red chillies, a large swinging sofa on which to dream, and baskets of lavender and vanilla pods that you can dip your fingers into and sniff. The ground is covered with fallen leaves. </p> <p>Our guide is the friendly Ruby Onions, who shows us inside the garden shed where animals and plants are hibernating for the winter. After the jollity of the garden, this is another enchanted environment, a place of shadows and light and warmth where wide-awake potatoes have to be soothed back to sleep with a lullaby and apples in basket cots with duvets and pillows demand a bedtime story. </p> <p>That's exactly what we get with a little help from Ruby's friends, Sunny, with his mane of red hair and gold waistcoat, and Dewdrop. There are potentially six different stories on offer, from the tale of the potato Cinderella to the one we heard about the mole and his hole. I say heard, but that's not strictly correct - one of the great joys of this performance is that it makes you feel that you are part of the story and that you've dug a mole hole yourself. </p> <p>This is, of course, the very simplest kind of theatre. But it recognises something that so much theatre for adults appears to have forgotten - that the word play means just that. This is a world of dressing up, dazzling jewel-like colours, cosy moments and the myriad possibilities of \"let's pretend\". It is a wonderfully imaginative work and a springboard for young imaginations. </p> <p>It is also completely free for performances at London's Royal Festival Hall over Christmas, which must be the seasonal gift of the year.
