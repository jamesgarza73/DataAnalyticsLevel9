Mr Paisley, a staunch critic of the Good Friday agreement, said Mr Trimble's recent warnings that the peace process could be heading for a review have dealt the process a critical blow. He said: \"It has been shattered by what Mr Trimble has said - that they now need to devise new workable democratic structures for the agreement.\"</p> <p>However, the Northern Ireland minister, John Reid, insisted he had been encouraged by the constructive tone of today's discussions.</p> <p>\"I think the positive nature of this morning's meetings means we will be able to carry through the process,\" he said.</p> <p>He said all the suggestions put forward would be discussed with the Irish government on his trip to Dublin.</p>",

Mr Trimble said: \"I very much hope there is a progress as a result of these meetings but we are as yet uncertain.\" He appealed to republican leaders to show the \"moral courage\" displayed by unionists. Mr Trimble added: \"It is time for people to shoulder their obligations and I think that is true of republicans as well as nationalists.\" Mr Mallon told the prime minister that with talks on decommissioning, policing and demilitarisation still deadlocked, there was about a week left to get an agreement. The meeting came as Sinn Fein considered legal action to stop chief constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan from starting a recruitment campaign for the new policing service. In Belfast, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness warned that without the establishment of a policing board, the decision to go ahead would be illegal. Ahead of the today's meeting at Number 10, the Democratic Unionist party leader, the Reverend Ian Paisley, claimed the Northern Ireland peace process was now \"shattered\". Mr Paisley, a staunch critic of the Good Friday agreement, said Mr Trimble's recent warnings that the peace process could be heading for a review have dealt the process a critical blow. He said: \"It has been shattered by what Mr Trimble has said - that they now need to devise new workable democratic structures for the agreement.\" However, the Northern Ireland minister, John Reid, insisted he had been encouraged by the constructive tone of today's discussions. \"I think the positive nature of this morning's meetings means we will be able to carry through the process,\" he said. He said all the suggestions put forward would be discussed with the Irish government on his trip to Dublin.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair may find himself recorded in history as the first prime minister in 200 years forced to postpone Britain's census in peacetime. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, confirmed to MPs yesterday that ministers are drawing up plans to take the unprecedented step of postponing the census, which is due to take place on April 29, as a result of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. At a meeting of senior ministers in Downing Street on Tuesday night, the prime minister was told of growing fears that thousands of enumerators, who personally deliver census forms to millions of households, may be barred from distributing census forms to farms affected by the disease. Such a move would be the the first time in peacetime that that the operation to count Britain's population, which takes place every 10 years, has not been held on the date set down in parliament. The census was first held in England in 1801 after the Census Act was passed in 1800 and has been held every 10 years, apart from 1941 during the second world war. Government sources said last night that postponing the census would be a \"logistical nightmare\". As a first step, the home secretary, Jack Straw, would have to consult parliament to change the census date which has been set in law for Sunday April 29. After that, the government would have to reprint 32m census forms, which all have April 29 printed on them, a process which would take four months. The office for national statistics (ONS), which runs the census, would have to re-hire 70,000 enumerators who distribute the forms and visit people who struggle to fill in the forms. The enumerators, who will wear distinctive yellow jackets and who will carry yellow bags, do not have to visit every household in Britain because many census forms will be sent and returned by post. However, people living in rural areas, especially the elderly and those who live in outlying areas, are one of the key groups which are likely to be visited by the officials. The 1981 census was carried out during an earlier outbreak of foot and mouth disease. But this was restricted to the Isle of Wight, unlike the present outbreak which has spread rapidly across Britain. Officials from the Home Office and the Ministry of Agriculture, who have set up a joint working party, will make a final assessment towards the end of next month on whether to postpone the census. Government sources said last night that if the disease has not been contained by then, they are likely to decide to call for a postponement. Britain was reluctant to introduce a census until 1801, despite William the Conqueror's efforts with the Domesday Book in 1086, because churchgoers believed that it was sacrilegious to carry out head counts. Setting another date for the census would raise serious questions about holding the general election four days later on May 3, which is currently thought to be the preferred date. The prime minister will have to make up his mind about a May 3 general election on around April 4 or 5. Moving the election date would delight Tory strategists who have been praying that events force the prime minister to abandon his hopes of calling the election almost four years to the day after his first election victory in 1997. The Tories hope that Mr Blair may not be able to maintain his momentum in the opinion polls and their fortunes will revive if the election is pushed into early summer or even the autumn.",

      "byline": "Paul Whiteley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>We (myself with professors Patrick Seyd and Charles Pattie of Sheffield University) have been conducting a citizen audit, paid for by the Economic and Social Research Council and based on a sample of 3,000 adults. Its aim is to examine the meaning of citizenship in modern Britain and it looks at political participation and attitudes and voluntary activity of all kinds.</p> <p>Some 74% of our sample claimed to have voted in the 1997 general election, a figure which is only marginally more than the 72% who really did cross their ballot papers. Asking this question is an important guide to accuracy, since there is a well-known tendency for interviewees to claim they voted when in fact they did not. Since our audit provided a fairly good retrospective picture of the 1997 turnout, this suggests that it is a reliable guide to future behaviour.</p> <p>When asked how likely they were to vote next time, only 65% claimed it was \"very likely\" and if this works as a predictor then the 2001 general election is set to have the lowest turnout of any since Lloyd George went to the country in 1918. We also looked at differences in likely turnout among party supporters. As the chart shows, 87% of those who voted Tory in 1997 are very likely to vote in the next election. However, this is true of only 74% of those who voted Labour last time. As a political formation the Tories may be in difficulty but it appears that William Hague is shoring up support among the core Tory voters in a way which Tony Blair is not.</p> <p>These apathetic Labour voters tend to be dispropor tionately semi-skilled or unskilled manual workers, in their 20s and 30s and living on relatively low incomes. They also tend to be female and have relatively limited educational qualifications. They are twice as likely to strongly disagree with the proposition that \"the government is doing a good job in managing public services such as health care and education\" than they are to strongly agree with it. By the same token, they are more likely to distrust the government than voters in general.</p> <p>If translated into actual votes, these differences in turnout intentions between Labour and Tory supporters have important implications for the number of seats the Blair government is likely to lose in the election. Monthly opinion polls such as the Guardian/ICM suggest that Labour is far enough ahead of the Tories to repeat its 1997 victory on roughly the same scale. But take differen tial turnout into account and the picture does not look quite so rosy. In 1997, Labour got just over 13.5m votes and the Tories 9.5m. Imagine what would happen if 87% of the Tories voted again for their party and 74% of Labour supporters did the same for their party. In this event Labour would end up with 54% of the combined Labour and Tory vote total, rather than the 58% it actually took last time. The Tory share would go up from 42% of the two-party vote in 1997 to 46%.</p> <p>On this basis, Labour would still win the election but would lose seats. If we apply a seat forecasting model to these vote shares we can see what effects this has on the composition of the House of Commons. The model translates shares of total vote into seats and is based on the results of all general elections since the second world war. The model predicts that Labour would win 366 seats and the Tories 234, giving the Labour government an overall Commons majority of 73. Putting this another way, some 52 Labour MPs will be looking for alternative employment on the day after polling day - and that is because of differential turnout. However, if Labour managed to persuade their erstwhile supporters to turn out on the same scale as in 1997, few if any of these MPs would lose their places.</p> <p>We are simplifying. This projection does not take into account changes in the composition of the electorate over the past four years, vote switching between parties, tactical voting and several other factors. It does not take into account the extent to which Labour's grassroots will campaign to get the vote out locally. But it may be a portent of things to come, and it does have two further implications. If Labour wins the next election with a majority comparable to 1997's then this effectively leaves the Tories in the cold until the election after the election after next, which means 2009 or 2010.

      "bodyText": "We (myself with professors Patrick Seyd and Charles Pattie of Sheffield University) have been conducting a citizen audit, paid for by the Economic and Social Research Council and based on a sample of 3,000 adults. Its aim is to examine the meaning of citizenship in modern Britain and it looks at political participation and attitudes and voluntary activity of all kinds. Some 74% of our sample claimed to have voted in the 1997 general election, a figure which is only marginally more than the 72% who really did cross their ballot papers. Asking this question is an important guide to accuracy, since there is a well-known tendency for interviewees to claim they voted when in fact they did not. Since our audit provided a fairly good retrospective picture of the 1997 turnout, this suggests that it is a reliable guide to future behaviour. When asked how likely they were to vote next time, only 65% claimed it was \"very likely\" and if this works as a predictor then the 2001 general election is set to have the lowest turnout of any since Lloyd George went to the country in 1918. We also looked at differences in likely turnout among party supporters. As the chart shows, 87% of those who voted Tory in 1997 are very likely to vote in the next election. However, this is true of only 74% of those who voted Labour last time. As a political formation the Tories may be in difficulty but it appears that William Hague is shoring up support among the core Tory voters in a way which Tony Blair is not. These apathetic Labour voters tend to be dispropor tionately semi-skilled or unskilled manual workers, in their 20s and 30s and living on relatively low incomes. They also tend to be female and have relatively limited educational qualifications. They are twice as likely to strongly disagree with the proposition that \"the government is doing a good job in managing public services such as health care and education\" than they are to strongly agree with it. By the same token, they are more likely to distrust the government than voters in general. If translated into actual votes, these differences in turnout intentions between Labour and Tory supporters have important implications for the number of seats the Blair government is likely to lose in the election. Monthly opinion polls such as the Guardian/ICM suggest that Labour is far enough ahead of the Tories to repeat its 1997 victory on roughly the same scale. But take differen tial turnout into account and the picture does not look quite so rosy. In 1997, Labour got just over 13.5m votes and the Tories 9.5m. Imagine what would happen if 87% of the Tories voted again for their party and 74% of Labour supporters did the same for their party. In this event Labour would end up with 54% of the combined Labour and Tory vote total, rather than the 58% it actually took last time. The Tory share would go up from 42% of the two-party vote in 1997 to 46%. On this basis, Labour would still win the election but would lose seats. If we apply a seat forecasting model to these vote shares we can see what effects this has on the composition of the House of Commons. The model translates shares of total vote into seats and is based on the results of all general elections since the second world war. The model predicts that Labour would win 366 seats and the Tories 234, giving the Labour government an overall Commons majority of 73. Putting this another way, some 52 Labour MPs will be looking for alternative employment on the day after polling day - and that is because of differential turnout. However, if Labour managed to persuade their erstwhile supporters to turn out on the same scale as in 1997, few if any of these MPs would lose their places. We are simplifying. This projection does not take into account changes in the composition of the electorate over the past four years, vote switching between parties, tactical voting and several other factors. It does not take into account the extent to which Labour's grassroots will campaign to get the vote out locally. But it may be a portent of things to come, and it does have two further implications. If Labour wins the next election with a majority comparable to 1997's then this effectively leaves the Tories in the cold until the election after the election after next, which means 2009 or 2010. By contrast, a majority of 73 could easily be lost in one go, making the 2005 election an open contest. A second implication is that a loss by the Tories on the same scale as occurred in 1997 almost certainly means curtains for William Hague. But the loss of an election in which he wins back nearly 70 seats for the Tories might well save his leadership. \u0095 Paul Whiteley is professor of government at the University of Essex and director of the ESRC programme on democracy and participation. whiteley@essex.ac.uk",

      "bodyText": "The government faces the prospect of a court action by Ken Livingstone and a campaign of strikes on the London Underground in the run-up to the election after it failed last night to meet its own timetable for agreeing a formula for the future of the tube. The board of the London mayor's Transport for London organisation, set up to run the city's transport system, is today expected to authorise a legal challenge to the government's part-privatisation plans after hearing a report on weeks of fruitless negotiations from the transport commissioner, Bob Kiley. Mr Kiley, who has blamed the situation on the chancellor, Gordon Brown, was yesterday given last-minute confirmation that a suggestion passed to him on Monday - offering extra powers to intervene in the private companies bidding for the tube - was in fact a firm government proposal. But a source close to Mr Kiley said that although it represented the first time the government had offered \"more than cosmetic changes\" to its plans, the proposal still did not provide the \"essential unified management control\" that Mr Kiley and Mr Livingstone have demanded. Early last month, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, asked Mr Kiley to \"modify\" the government's partial sell-off scheme with the aim of reaching a deal by the end of February. Negotiations were continuing last night, but allies of the London mayor accused the government of reneging on that agreement and complained that sensible negotiation had proved almost impossible, with the Treasury intervening to veto any package floated by other government officials. The Greater London Assembly yesterday voted to \"call upon the government to honour its commitment to Bob Kiley to provide unified management of the London underground,\" with Labour members abstaining. A transport department spokeswoman said that Mr Prescott had not regarded the end of February as a firm deadline. But without a change of heart, the argument looks increasingly likely to end up in the high court. Pressure on the government over the tube also intensified when the largest rail union announced a fresh ballot for strikes over jobs and safety under the part-privatisation scheme. The Rail Maritime and Transport union was banned by the high court on a technicality from joining the traindrivers' union Aslef in a one-day walkout last month. The result of the new ballot of its 7,500 tube members is expected in a week, with renewed stoppages possible from mid-March. The risk of court action and strikes in the run-up to a general election is alarming London Labour MPs.

NUS estimates that next year's students will each owe an average of \u00a312,000 on graduation.\" </p> <p> Most institutions are compiling petitions and boycotting lectures, but at Luton they will be showing their grief over student debt by wearing black armbands as they stage their protest. Black armbands also appeared among the early risers at Lincoln. Their president Verity Coyle said: \"Students are stereotyped as being lazy and having trouble making it for nine o'clock lectures, our students feel so strongly about the 'Grants not Fees' debate that they are walking out.\" </p> <p> At Aston University in Birmingham students are staging a cardboard city sleep out. Goldsmiths College, London, is joining forces with nearby Lewisham College of Further Education to show that the journey from further to higher education is the most expensive one students will ever make by forming a human chain along the bus route linking the two campuses. </p> <p> Following the NUS support for the lecturers picketing over the last few months UNISON, NATFHE and AUT members are supporting students in today's action.

There was a human chain in South London and mass balloon launches nation-wide with students writing their debts on cards to send aloft. In the run up to the general election, National Shutdown Day aims to push student hardship up the political agenda, though the Selby train disaster and the foot and mouth crisis ensure that student protests will not make headlines tomorrow. Education Secretary David Blunkett's recent decision to rule out top-up fees has given the NUS some comfort. Now they are still campaigning for the reintroduction of targeted maintenance grants and raising the student loan repayment threshold above \u00a314,000 so that students do not have to start to pay back loans until they can better afford to. Student debt has trebled in the last three years. Mr James said: \"No matter how frivolous or serious the activity, the message is clear; students are angry that debt is increasing by \u00a31.5 billion per year. NUS estimates that next year's students will each owe an average of \u00a312,000 on graduation.\" Most institutions are compiling petitions and boycotting lectures, but at Luton they will be showing their grief over student debt by wearing black armbands as they stage their protest. Black armbands also appeared among the early risers at Lincoln. Their president Verity Coyle said: \"Students are stereotyped as being lazy and having trouble making it for nine o'clock lectures, our students feel so strongly about the 'Grants not Fees' debate that they are walking out.\" At Aston University in Birmingham students are staging a cardboard city sleep out. Goldsmiths College, London, is joining forces with nearby Lewisham College of Further Education to show that the journey from further to higher education is the most expensive one students will ever make by forming a human chain along the bus route linking the two campuses. Following the NUS support for the lecturers picketing over the last few months UNISON, NATFHE and AUT members are supporting students in today's action. They encourage lecturers not to penalise those who take part in the boycotts.",

He had been an active proponent of Thatcherism as an undergraduate and found a natural home at the Telegraph, but also wrote for the Mail, where he met the journalist Sue Douglas, whom he married in 1994.

      "bodyText": "The search for the source of the foot and mouth epidemic switched to pig swill made from the left-overs from schools and restaurants yesterday. Robert Waugh, the Northumberland farmer whose pigs are thought to have been the source of the outbreak, said they had been fed on swill made from waste collected from schools in Sunderland and Gateshead. Sunderland city council confirmed that it had had a con tract with Mr Waugh's brother Ronnie to collect school waste for free, but the contract had been terminated in January when he asked for money for taking it away. Gateshead council said that it had an informal arrangement for the collection of \"plated waste\" from their schools. The Waughs also used waste from local restaurants. Robert Waugh was licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture to feed the waste to his pigs and says that it was heat-treated as required by law. Heating should inactivate foot and mouth, according to Stephen Curry, a researcher in the biophysics department at Imperial College, London. But there has been anecdotal evidence of meat products being the cause of the disease in the past. Mr Waugh's suggestion that he had not fed his pigs \"anything that hadn't already been served up on bairns' plates\" caused alarm among parents. Although humans cannot catch foot and mouth from eating meat, and the source cannot yet be confirmed, it raised the possibility that the school meals had contained infected meat. All large catering companies use burgers, sausages, mince and other cheap processed meats in their cooking, and the quality depends on the cost specified in their contracts with schools. \"There have been so many problems around meat that people do now distrust school meals,\" said Joe Harvey, direc tor of the Health Education Trust. New standards for school meals will be enforced from April. But processed meat is often made from inferior quality materials. Mechanically recovered meat (MRM), a slurry produced from pig and chicken bones, is still used. The regulations permit the use of the rectum, testicles, udders, feet and tails in MRM for cooked meat products. Because of BSE, MRM may no longer be made from the vertebral columns of ruminants in the EU, but the rules do not apply to meat products imported from outside the EU.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair will today signal one of his big second term themes when he calls for a drive to improve the reading and writing skills of 7m British adults whose literacy is below that of the average 11-year-old. He will propose that as a condition of benefit, the illiterate unemployed or claimants on the new deal be required to go on basic read ing and writing courses. Those who took intensive courses of up to three months would receive about \u00a310 extra in benefits. But some claimants might lose benefit if they refused. Mr Blair and David Blunkett, the education secretary, will promote a \u00a31.5bn programme over three years following the government report, A Fresh Start, written by Sir Claus Moser two years ago. It has been estimated that Britain's low skills base costs the economy \u00a311bn a year. Since then the government has set up the learning and skills council, replacing the training and enterprise councils. Bryan Sanderson, the chairman of Sunderland football club and executive director of BP Amoco, is chairing the council. Ministers claim he is so concerned by levels of adult illiteracy that he is trying to improve the quality of the Sunderland football programme, as it is probably one of the few pieces of printed material that fans read each week. Pilot projects will require early basic skills screening of claimants on job seekers allowance, as well as anyone on the voluntary new deal for lone parents or for the older unemployed. Screening will take place after six months on the programme. Ministers are also examining family literacy programmes, in which parents and their children learn together; tailor-made strategies for targeting resources on disadvantaged areas; and more opportunities for basic skills training in the workplace. Government estimates suggest that on average an employed person could earn an extra \u00a31,000 a year with improved numeracy skills. Ministers want to make the materials used for improving basic adult skills more relevant to everyday situations. Illiterate and innumerate adults are less likely to vote or own their own home, and more prone to physical and mental health problems. The government is already committed to doubling the numbers taking part in basic literacy and numeracy programmes to 500,000 by 2002. Ministers have also set a target to reduce the number of adults who have difficulty with literacy or numeracy by 750,000 by 2004. Research published yesterday by the office of national statistics showed that 14.9% of adults of working age in England - 4.8m - have no qualifications. Ministers have also encouraged trade unions to appoint learning representatives, as they already appoint health and safety representatves. Ministers have already announced an increase in spending on adult skills from \u00a3241m this financial year to \u00a3403m in 2003-4. Research by the National Foundation for Education Research shows adults involved in family learning have higher attendance, retention and completion rates than adults on courses and their progression to further study or employment is high. The research also showed little is known about basic skills teaching on the ground. National surveys of adults' attainment in literacy and numeracy show that about 20% have less than functional literacy, and about 20% have poor numeracy. At the launch in Downing Street today, the TUC general secretary, John Monks, will say that the number of adults lacking basic literacy and numeracy \"is nothing short of a national disaster, a strain on our economy and a blight on individual lives\". He will urge companies to do more for workers who struggle to read and write.",

Investigators said it was one of the possible reasons why the four-wheel drive vehicle careered off a motorway into the path of an express train, killing 13 people in the crash. Police in north Yorkshire today recovered the bodies from the wreckage of the mangled GNER passenger train, but say further victims may still be discovered as the carriages are cleared from the track.

A 90-year-old woman drove her Morris Minor convertible from a level crossing onto the track at Petersfield, Hampshire. She was just a foot away from high voltage power lines that would have killed her. Police immediately attended the scene and contacted Railtrack, which switched off the power to the line and stopped all trains for more than an hour while the Morris 1000 was winched to safety. Police praised the quick actions last night of a 46-year-old motorist who averted the possible disaster by pulling the woman to safety and alerting emergency services to the danger. The motorist, who chose to remain anonymous, said he had to stop the woman from going back for her handbag after he had dragged her from the vehicle. He said he was following the old Morris 1000 along Kingsferndon Lane in Petersfield just after 7pm last night, when he noticed the vehicle was being driven slowly and erratically. \"I knew something was up when she started indicating right near the level crossing. I started beeping my horn to alert her and immediately dialled 999,\" he said. \"She turned onto the track and got stuck on the cattle grid next to it.

Though they have little faith in the system, the car and the bus are not permanent alternatives.</p> <p>It is on the long-distance routes where considerable gaps in the system still exist. Poor punctuality still plagues the east coast, west coast and inter-city connections between London, south Wales and the West Country. Some services have been 50% down.</p> <p>Stewart Francis, chairman of the Rail Passengers Council, the independent body which monitors rail operators, said: \"This is an enormous tragedy, and it has come at a time when passenger confidence in the railway network was slowly getting back to normal.\"</p> <p>If yesterday's crash had been Railtrack's fault, the pressure on the government to renationalise the company would have been irresistible. As it is, the need for Labour to make a positive declaration on the future of the railways before the election, is overwhelming.</p> <p>Railtrack will get a further \u00a31bn from the government to help it out of its post-Hatfield mess, but it will be at a price.</p> <p>The company will effectively lay itself open to tighter regulation, allowing inspectors to examine its books and report their findings to the rail regulator, Tom Winsor.</p> <p>It means that Railtrack will have to appoint a new chairman to succeed the outgoing Sir Philip Beck, and a fresh board will eventually be appointed. It means that if the government wants a more effective railway, it will probably have to spend more than the \u00a315bn over the next five years from the taxpayer than it has already agreed.</p>",

It's still a public relations disaster.\" Yesterday's events are likely to concentrate the industry's efforts on trying to restore public confidence in a system of transportation that many, particularly in London and the south-east, have to use each day to travel to work. Since Hatfield, passengers have gradually been returning to rail. Though they have little faith in the system, the car and the bus are not permanent alternatives. It is on the long-distance routes where considerable gaps in the system still exist. Poor punctuality still plagues the east coast, west coast and inter-city connections between London, south Wales and the West Country. Some services have been 50% down. Stewart Francis, chairman of the Rail Passengers Council, the independent body which monitors rail operators, said: \"This is an enormous tragedy, and it has come at a time when passenger confidence in the railway network was slowly getting back to normal.\" If yesterday's crash had been Railtrack's fault, the pressure on the government to renationalise the company would have been irresistible. As it is, the need for Labour to make a positive declaration on the future of the railways before the election, is overwhelming. Railtrack will get a further \u00a31bn from the government to help it out of its post-Hatfield mess, but it will be at a price. The company will effectively lay itself open to tighter regulation, allowing inspectors to examine its books and report their findings to the rail regulator, Tom Winsor. It means that Railtrack will have to appoint a new chairman to succeed the outgoing Sir Philip Beck, and a fresh board will eventually be appointed. It means that if the government wants a more effective railway, it will probably have to spend more than the \u00a315bn over the next five years from the taxpayer than it has already agreed.",

A little after 6am, just as he approached the bridge which carries the M62 over the east coast mainline railway south of Selby, the driver lost control. Still doing about 60mph, the Land Rover, the trailer and the Renault swept off the motorway through a gap in the crash barrier and down the embankment before coming to rest on the southbound railway track.</p> <p>The driver, 36, suffered whiplash injuries in the crash. But realising the danger his stricken vehicle posed for oncoming trains, he managed to get out and rang 999 on his mobile. The call was put through to the emergency services control centre in York at 6.12am. By then it was already too late.</p> <p>As the operator took down his details, the driver shouted: \"The train's coming,\" before making a vain attempt to warn the train driver. Seconds later, there was a huge bang as the 04.45 Great North Eastern Intercity service from Newcastle to London King's Cross ploughed straight into the Land Rover at 125mph.</p> <p>As the train hurtled down the track at more than two miles a minute, some of the carriages started to derail. But many of the 100 or so slumbering passengers were slow to realise that they had been involved in a crash at all. Some noticed that the line had become rougher, describing it as a \"gritty\" feeling beneath the wheels. A few mistook it fleetingly for deep snow on the line. Then they noticed gravel flying past the windows and realised the train had left the tracks.</p> <p>Even then, however, the carriages were staying upright and for a few minutes, it looked as if disaster could be averted. But about 800 yards down the line, the express bounced over a set of points which threw it into the path of a 1,500-tonne freight train heading in the opposite direction at 60mph.</p> <p>The effect was catastrophic. The express locomotive - later revealed to be the same one involved in the Hatfield crash - was mangled in the impact and left strewn across the two lines. All nine of the other carriages derailed.

Another coach was thrown through the trees lining the track and came to twisted rest 50 yards away in an adjacent field; two more slewed off the track into the same field.</p> <p>The freight train locomotive, carrying coal to Ferrybridge power station, ended up on its side in the garden of a house next to the track. Four of the wagons also derailed.</p> <p>\"Everything seemed to be fine,\" said Raymond Pringley, a former train conductor from York, who was in a carriage at the back of the express. \"But all of a sudden the track seemed to give way under us and the lights went out and then there was strong smell of diesel.\"</p> <p>For the first few moments after the carriages came to rest, there was silence. Then, through the smoke and darkness, survivors began picking their way through the broken glass, luggage and other wreckage to safety.</p> <p>Mr Pringley got out through an emergency door and used a phone at the side of the track to contact the signalman, before returning to the train. \"It was utter chaos. A lot of people were shouting.

Inside the train, survivors were screaming for help while mobiles rang unanswered as anguished friends and relatives tried to contact loved ones on the train.</p> <p>With the crash site shrouded in driving sleet and snow the crew returned to their ambulance and radioed back to York control the scale of the disaster. Thirty ambulances from all over Yorkshire, and Lincolnshire, were ordered to the site, along with two RAF SeaKing helicopters and the West Yorkshire air ambulance.</p> <p>Five minutes later, the first of 20 fire engines arrived. \"This is the worse scene I have come across in 14 years with the fire service,\" said assistant divisional officer Graham Buckle, from the North Yorkshire fire and rescue service. \"When I arrived it was still semi-darkness, there were people wandering around and screaming for help.</p> <p>\"It was a scene of shock and bewilderment, people not knowing where they were.

Many were not hurt but could not get out of the train so we forced open doors and broke windows to get them out.\"</p> <p>The emergency services job was made more difficult by the location of the crash. \"Our crews had to carry patients about 100 yards across muddy fields to the field hospital where they could be picked up by ambulance. It was very depressing and distressing,\" said Nigel Metcalfe of the Tees, East and North Yorkshire ambulance service.</p> <p>As trauma teams from hospitals in York, Hull, Leeds and Pontefract headed for the scene, a triage area was set up on an adjacent farm where the most seriously injured were treated before being transferred to hospital.</p> <p>Firefighters using heat- and sound-seeking equipment battled in the wreckage for hours to free trapped casualties, some of whom were heard tapping signals to rescuers and pleading for help.</p> <p>Five hours after the crash the emergency services had given up any hope of finding anyone left alive. \"We've swept the whole train four times with thermal imaging equipment and sound detectors,\" said divisional officer Brian Bell of North Yorkshire fire service, as his team made a final attempt to check reports of a weak voice from the void beneath the train's upended buffet car.

Firefighters then began the task of removing the bodies of the remaining dead from the wreckage.

At approximately 6.20 this morning, a Land Rover was travelling west along the M62 motorway, pulling a trailer that was carrying another car. It left the motorway as it approached a bridge that crosses the east coast main line. The bridge is protected by crash barriers, but the vehicle left the road some 30 meters before the beginning of the crash barrier.

The railway inspectorate reported last night that 29 vehicles have come off bridges or gone through fencing in the last three years and two have been struck by trains.

Along with Carlton, it expects figures to pick up in the summer, when its financial year draws to a close. The downturn in income growth has been caused by the lack of big sporting events, such as the Rugby World Cup that boosted 1999 figures. The knock-on effect of the downturn in the US economy has also been a contributory factor. However, Mr Green said the long-term prospects for ITV advertising are good as companies seek to protect the diminishing life-cycles of their products. \"ITV gives advertisers fast access to a mass audience.

      "body": "<p>Tragedy returned to Britain's railways yesterday leaving 13 people dead and 75 injured after a freak road accident caused a devastating collision between a high-speed passenger train and a freight train on one of the country's fastest lines.</p> <p>In an appalling blow to an industry already reeling from a series of disasters, a Land Rover hauling a trailer careered off the M62, down an embankment and was struck by a London-bound train on the east coast main line travelling at 125mph. The derailed intercity was then hit seconds later by a freight train travelling at 60 mph in the opposite direction.</p> <p>The accident happened at 6.15am. Emergency services worked for more than five hours to free trapped passengers from the wreckage of the train at Great Heck near Selby in North Yorkshire.</p> <p>Police were last night interviewing the 36-year-old driver of the Land Rover at Goole police station to try to find out why the car slewed off the M62 westbound carriageway. One theory being examined was a blown-out tyre.</p> <p>The man, who is believed to have suffered only whiplash injuries, was delivering a car from his home county of Lincolnshire to Wigan. North Yorkshire police said he was in a distressed state.</p> <p>Last night John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, told the Commons he had ordered the health and safety executive to produce an interim report into the crash within the next few days so that he could make a decision on what further steps needed to be taken.</p> <p>Attention is likely to focus on the absence of adequate crash barriers at such a vulnerable spot. Although the bridge and a few metres either side were protected, the Land Rover left the carriageway before the barriers began.</p> <p>The Highways Agency last night announced a review of barriers over rail bridges on motorways and trunk roads. In the past three years, 29 vehicles have come off bridges or gone through fencing, and two have struck trains.</p> <p>The chief executive of Great North Eastern Railways, Christopher Garnett, made no attempt to hide his incredulity at the circumstances of the tragedy. Touring the crash scene, where his company's dark blue and crimson coaches lay mangled and strewn across a field, he said: \"How can a car have got on to our railway line? It's terrible, unbelievable. It's something which has got to be investigated.\"</p> <p>In a bizarre coincidence, the locomotive on the passenger train in yesterday's crash was the same as the one involved in the Hatfield accident in October last year, GNER said.</p> <p>\"We put different locomotives on different trains everyday. It had no material effect on the accident, it is just a coincidence,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>Last night the emergency services were still working to free 11 bodies still in the wreckage. Among the dead were two of the train drivers. A third driver who was in the cab of the intercity was among the 10 people remaining in hospital with serious or critical injuries.</p> <p>The crash is the third major disaster on Britain's railways in the space of 18 months, following the Paddington crash in October 1999 which claimed 31 lives and last year's Hatfield derailment when four people were killed.</p> <p>The Land Rover was travelling at about 60mph when it left the carriageway and its momentum took it over rough grass and gravel before toppling down an embankment on to the railway line. As the driver scrambled clear of his vehicle and frantically alerted the emergency services on his mobile phone, the 0445 Newcastle to London train travelling at 125mph careered into the Land Rover and its trailer.</p> <p>The impact derailed the train, which slewed on to the northbound track where it collided almost head on with a 1,500-tonne freight train carrying coal.</p> <p>Several carriages were crushed by the impact, while another was thrown down an embankment coming to rest in a field near Great Heck, where villagers were woken by the sound of the crash.</p> <p>Drama student Janine Edwards, 22, from York, who was on the train, said: \"I heard screaming and shouting and the lights went out. I held on to the table in front of me and then there was a huge impact.\"</p> <p>The emergency services were confronted with a scene of utter devastation.

      "bodyText": "Tragedy returned to Britain's railways yesterday leaving 13 people dead and 75 injured after a freak road accident caused a devastating collision between a high-speed passenger train and a freight train on one of the country's fastest lines. In an appalling blow to an industry already reeling from a series of disasters, a Land Rover hauling a trailer careered off the M62, down an embankment and was struck by a London-bound train on the east coast main line travelling at 125mph. The derailed intercity was then hit seconds later by a freight train travelling at 60 mph in the opposite direction. The accident happened at 6.15am. Emergency services worked for more than five hours to free trapped passengers from the wreckage of the train at Great Heck near Selby in North Yorkshire. Police were last night interviewing the 36-year-old driver of the Land Rover at Goole police station to try to find out why the car slewed off the M62 westbound carriageway. One theory being examined was a blown-out tyre. The man, who is believed to have suffered only whiplash injuries, was delivering a car from his home county of Lincolnshire to Wigan. North Yorkshire police said he was in a distressed state. Last night John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, told the Commons he had ordered the health and safety executive to produce an interim report into the crash within the next few days so that he could make a decision on what further steps needed to be taken. Attention is likely to focus on the absence of adequate crash barriers at such a vulnerable spot. Although the bridge and a few metres either side were protected, the Land Rover left the carriageway before the barriers began. The Highways Agency last night announced a review of barriers over rail bridges on motorways and trunk roads. In the past three years, 29 vehicles have come off bridges or gone through fencing, and two have struck trains. The chief executive of Great North Eastern Railways, Christopher Garnett, made no attempt to hide his incredulity at the circumstances of the tragedy. Touring the crash scene, where his company's dark blue and crimson coaches lay mangled and strewn across a field, he said: \"How can a car have got on to our railway line? It's terrible, unbelievable. It's something which has got to be investigated.\" In a bizarre coincidence, the locomotive on the passenger train in yesterday's crash was the same as the one involved in the Hatfield accident in October last year, GNER said. \"We put different locomotives on different trains everyday. It had no material effect on the accident, it is just a coincidence,\" said a spokesman. Last night the emergency services were still working to free 11 bodies still in the wreckage. Among the dead were two of the train drivers. A third driver who was in the cab of the intercity was among the 10 people remaining in hospital with serious or critical injuries. The crash is the third major disaster on Britain's railways in the space of 18 months, following the Paddington crash in October 1999 which claimed 31 lives and last year's Hatfield derailment when four people were killed. The Land Rover was travelling at about 60mph when it left the carriageway and its momentum took it over rough grass and gravel before toppling down an embankment on to the railway line. As the driver scrambled clear of his vehicle and frantically alerted the emergency services on his mobile phone, the 0445 Newcastle to London train travelling at 125mph careered into the Land Rover and its trailer. The impact derailed the train, which slewed on to the northbound track where it collided almost head on with a 1,500-tonne freight train carrying coal. Several carriages were crushed by the impact, while another was thrown down an embankment coming to rest in a field near Great Heck, where villagers were woken by the sound of the crash. Drama student Janine Edwards, 22, from York, who was on the train, said: \"I heard screaming and shouting and the lights went out. I held on to the table in front of me and then there was a huge impact.\" The emergency services were confronted with a scene of utter devastation. An ambulance spokesman said the crash site was \"like a scene from a bomb explosion\". A temporary hospital was set up in a barn before a fleet of ambulances and helicopters took the injured to hospital. More than 100 firefighters used chain saws and thermal rescue equipment to tunnel to trapped survivors who were banging on carriage walls. The 75 injured passengers were taken to seven hospitals across Yorkshire, where 30 were described as having serious injuries. The remaining passengers were walking wounded. The last casualty was cut free at 1pm, after Mr Prescott had arrived by helicopter to thank rescuers and offer condolences to the injured and relatives of the dead. The prime minister, Tony Blair, told the Commons that all MPs shared \"profound distress\" at yesterday's accident while the Queen expressed her sympathy for those who had lost loved ones. Last night, Gary Barnett, area commander with North Yorkshire police, said he could not rule out the possibility that the death toll may rise once the wreckage has been lifted.",

The Formula One carmakers have said they will scupper a deal that gives EM.TV control of the commercial rights to the sport, because it could see motor racing confined to pay-TV. However, the German group today said it would broadcast the sport on free-to-air TV, even though pay-TV company Kirch co-financed the deal. \"We are not interested in putting it solely on pay-TV, so there is no reason for the car companies to be concerned,\" said an EM.TV spokeswoman. \"There has been irritation on all sides, but there is no need for it because all of us want to expand the business and make it more attractive.\" A spokesman for FIA, Formula One's ruling body, confirmed that the organisation could veto any deal it regards as not in the best interests of the sport. They car owners want as many viewers as possible to watch Formula One, as it publicises their products and boosts car sales. \"If there is a change in ownership of the commercial rights, FIA has 60 days in which to examine the arrangement. It has the right to veto it,\" he said. The veto allows FIA to strip the commercial rights from holding company SLEC, which is now 75%-owned by EM.TV and Kirch. If FIA carries out its threat, both companies will have paid \u00a3700m for a worthless asset and cash-strapped EM.TV could be staring at bankruptcy. The other figure looming over the complex negotiations is Bernie Ecclestone, the billionaire owner of SLEC who can veto any change of ownership in the company. But EM.TV today said it was in constant contact with the tycoon, and was \"not concerned\" with the possibility of him blocking the arrangement. \"We do not anticipate Mr Ecclestone stopping the deal,\" said the EM.TV spokeswoman. In a further twist to the convoluted proceedings, Kirch can pull out of the deal if it is not satisfied with EM.TV's financial results, which must be produced before March 30. EM.TV became a stockmarket pariah last year when it was forced to slash its profit forecasts by a staggering 90% following a series of accounting errors and ill-advised acquisitions.

      "bodyText": "Black pupils appear to be disciplined by teachers more harshly than their white counterparts for similar offences, the government's schools watchdog claimed yesterday. Publishing the results of a detailed study of behaviour and attendance in secondary schools, the chief inspector, Mike Tomlinson, said there was no firm evidence of racism in schools but further investigation was needed to get to the root of the problem. Inspectors from the office for standards in education (Ofsted) visited 10 secondary schools across the country with higher than average levels of bad behaviour and poor attendance and concluded in their report: \"The length of fixed-period exclusions varied considerably in some schools between black and white pupils for what were described as the same or similar incidents\". Some schools treated black pupils more harshly than white in a way which seemed \"inconsistent\". The report, Improving Attendance and Behaviour, claims that while it does not follow that schools treated pupils differently because of their ethnicity, \"they certainly could leave both pupils and parents with the impression that they had done so\". Mr Tomlinson said black pupils were typically suspended for a five-day period for bad or \"challenging\" behaviour, while their white classmates were removed for only three days. But it was impossible to say how much of the inconsistent treatment was due to racism on the part of teachers. \"I would want to have much more evidence before I would want to say categorically that was the case,\" he said. Mr Tomlinson's predecessor, Chris Woodhead, was last year criticised by the commission for racial equality for failing to cooperate with a research study into racism. Earlier this week, the home secretary, Jack Straw, announced new powers giving statutory force to the official campaign to tackle institutional racism in the public sector. One explanation for the tough action against black pupils, the Ofsted report said, was because teachers felt intimidated. Yet there were also cases where teachers appeared to be reluctant to discipline black Caribbean boys for minor misdemeanours out of fear of accusations of racism, \"thus allowing bad behaviour to escalate and be dealt with through the severe sanction of exclusion\". Overall, the rate of exclusions has fallen from the all-time high of 12,668 four years ago, with black pupils six times more likely to be excluded from school than their white peers. The report concludes that good teaching is the key to getting pupils to school and in meeting the needs of those most at risk of disaffection. In addition, boys were four times more likely to be expelled than girls, although girls were largely responsible for sustained bullying. And 66% of permanent exclusions in the schools surveyed involved pupils aged 13 to 15. Attendance was still a cause of concern, with national average levels in secondary schools edging up over the past four years from 92.6% to 93%. Generally, schools in \"leafy suburbs\" had better attendance, but even these were affected by parents taking pupils for holidays in school time. John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"It is no coincidence that Ofsted is drawing attention to behaviour problems at a time of teacher shortage. Pupils like stability and in many schools that stability has disappeared as one supply teacher after another takes their classes.\" The shadow education secretary, Theresa May, said: \"These findings show the importance of schools having well-defined discipline policies and the freedom to stick to them.\" Improving Attendance and Behaviour in Secondary Schools is available at Ofsted",

In the case of the Guardian, the official concerned is an extremely efficient diplomat, previously posted in the Baltic states, who is mercifully prompt and helpful when bureaucratic problems arise. The last time we had a cup of tea together, we chatted amiably about this and that; how he could perhaps set up an appointment with a certain official, or lunch with another. As I was leaving, my minder rather sheepishly handed me a buff envelope and apologised for having to give me its contents. Inside was a lengthy diatribe sent to the Russian foreign ministry from a provincial Russian politician complaining about a report I had written about his parish. The kneejerk response of the provincial politician or official when offended by an insolent journalist is to turn to the superior authority of the state in the belief that the offender will be disciplined or leant on. Since that's the way things work in Russia, the complainers assume things are the same for foreigners. The politician's conclusion about my report was that it had obviously been ''ordered'' - that is written on someone else's (and not one's editors) instructions and paid for. A little later, the same accusation was levelled by the bosses at a Siberian nuclear facility. I had reported on the findings of Russian and US environmentalists, that leakage from the facility had heavily polluted nearby rivers. Threatening to sue me - and the newspaper - the plant officials told the Russian media that the British journalist had obviously been bought. The accusations reveal more about those making them than their targets. Russia's politicians, officials and companies routinely buy favourable coverage in the Russian media and naturally assume that's the way the media operate everywhere. Such tawdry practices have just been brazenly and hilariously illustrated by a frustrated St Petersburg public relations firm that sent a bogus press release around the editorial offices of the finest newspapers in Moscow, then sat back and waited for the editors to name their price to ''cover'' the \"story\". The agency, Promaco, said it was fed up with the pervasive corruption of the Moscow media and wanted to encourage a cultural change by making a laughing stock of the editors, even if the company risked being in breach of media laws in the process.

The GU website will be battling it out for the best online service award with ft.com, itn.co.uk, ThisisLondon, SchoolsNet and Sport.Telegraph at the BPA ceremony on March 21. It is the second time the Guardian has been nominated for a press award. Two weeks ago the judges announced they had shortlisted MediaGuardian.co.uk's Amy Vickers for the best online journalist of the year award. Ms Vickers, 28, is one of MediaGuardian.co.uk's leading writers and has been breaking news about the internet and other new media for the past three years. Earlier this week she revealed Sir Bob Geldof's deckchair.com was the latest celebrity-backed website to fall victim to the dot.com depression. The story was followed up by virtually every national newspaper. In other BPA shortlists unveiled today, the Guardian and Observer have both been nominated for newspaper of the year; while Observer Sport Monthly is up for best supplement. In addition, the Guardian's Steve Bell is up for the best cartoonist award and Tom Jenkins has been nominated in the sports photographer of the year category. Two weeks ago 11 other Guardian and Observer journalists, including Amy Vickers, were nominated for BPA honours when the first set of shortlists for the awards was published.",

He explains that tractors bought from farms in Europe are often in a better condition than their UK counterparts because of different farming practices and climates. </p> <p>\"In the UK we tend to buy big tractors and work the guts out of them. In countries such as Holland and Belgium they do not necessarily work their tractors as hard as we do. Our weather conditions are also a lot worse than they are, for example, in France and Italy.\" </p> <p>Later this year, <a href=\"http://www.first4farming.com\">First4Farming</a> is planning to launch an electronic marketplace for agricultural suppli ers, distributors and manufacturers so they can trade quicker and more efficiently in feeds, fertilisers and chemicals. All the traditional paperwork such as invoicing will be done online. Nick Evans, First4Farming's managing director, says the e-marketplace will be followed up early next year with a portal dedicated to farmers. </p> <p>On the site, farmers will have personal accounts so they can check their orders of grain and arrange deliveries to be made to their farms. \"The internet in itself will not improve the world price of grain, which is governed by many other factors. It is about removing the time-consuming costs and enabling farmers to run their businesses better,\" Evans explains. </p> <p>Despite these positive online initiatives, there are plenty of sites on the web that reflect the depressed nature of the UK farming industry. Many farmers are literally in despair about how to make a living after being subjected to a barrage of crises they feel unable to control. </p> <p>Sites such as <a href=\"http://www.farminghelp.org.uk\">Farming Help</a>, offer links to online rural crisis networks that offer emotional help to farmers who, in some extreme cases, have been driven to the verge of suicide as they do not know how they will support their families. </p> <p>Stephen Howe, the editor of Farmers' Weekly, says the crisis gripping UK farming is one of the reasons farmers are showing signs of being more responsive to the new solutions offered by the internet. \"Everyone is concerned about profit margins. Margins are very tight or non-existent in most cases. Farmers will get involved with anything that could improve the situation.\" </p> <p> Howe says support for the internet is across the board and not just restricted to younger farmers. Web-based services not only help with record-keeping, he explains, but farmers can comply online with government directives by, for example, submitting electronic statements reporting the movements of cattle. </p> <p>However, e-commerce for the agricultural industry is still very much in its infancy and Howe feels there are still a lot of big questions to be answered about how quickly it will take off and whether the entrepreneurs driving the changes willbe able to make a sizeable return on their new dot.com ventures. </p> <p>It's not just entrepreneurs who are eventually hoping to reap big profits from agricultural sites, farmers themselves are also getting involved. There are three farmers behind <a href=\"http://www.sheepsmart.co.uk\">Sheepsmart</a>, which provides sheep market prices in real time. Simon Barnes, who owns a 365-acre organic farm, north of Dumfries in Scotland, says he volunteered to help with the site because of the shortage of easily accessible market information. \"We're nosey sods and we like to know what price our neighbours sold their sheep at,\" he jokes. </p> <p>But he knows the online service is already influencing farmers' decisions. \"If it was a disaster on Monday you might think twice about taking your sheep to the market on Tuesday.\" </p> <p>Barnes has just launched a Wap phone-based service that relays sheep prices to farmers. The new service is called <a href=\"http://www.sheepmart.clara.net\">Sheepsmart mobile</a> and Barnes anticipates it could help put pressure on buyers to pay the best market rates. The Wap service lets farmers see what trades are being done at other markets while they are at ringside. </p> <p>With fully-fledged e-commerce yet to take off, Barnes believes that the web's biggest contribution so far has been to help cash-strapped farmers diversify by enabling them to promote farm shops and accommodation facilities. He runs a bed-and-breakfast service which, he says, has taken off since he set up his web site at <a href=\"http://www.borelandfarm.co.uk\">www.borelandfarm.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>But with such a large farm to manage, when does he get the time to log on to the net? \"I use it between 11 at night and two in the morning,\" he explains. \"I'm not a great sleeper.

Tomorrow's World's Philippa Forrester, Adrian Goldberg and David Bull from Watchdog and Countryfile's John Craven will present the programmes. Tomorrow's World will examine how technology could have prevented the crisis, looking at the use of a pellet that can be used to track the movement of livestock, thereby helping to identify where the disease was contracted. Meanwhile, the Watchdog team will look at the implications of the disease on the price of meat. The move, which was ordered in the past week, fits in with the BBC's drive to be seen as a leaner commissioning and scheduling beast than in the past, with the ability to move all its departments as one in a time of crisis.",

      "bodyText": "The BBC's John Ware has scooped the Royal Television Society's prestigious television journalist of the year award. The move is likely to increase pressure on the BBC to move Panorama back to a weekday slot. Mr Ware presented the last Panorama programme to go out on a Monday, the acclaimed Who Bombed Omagh?. He told MediaGuardian.co.uk the award proved Panorama was \"the only show in town\". Judges noted \"two programmes stood out\" from among Mr Ware's work with Panorama: the programme examining government health service statistics and the Omagh programme. \"Panorama is a great big warship,\" said Mr Ware. \"It sometimes gets buffeted about but its general track is pretty true and steady. \"I and all my colleagues hope the BBC will reinstate this programme in a weekday slot, which is where most of us think it ought to be,\" he added. The award comes as Richard Sambrook, the new head of BBC news, has indicated he wants to put more energy into strengthening current affairs coverage. The BBC trounced ITN in this year's RTS journalism awards. ITN news for ITV was shortlisted in four categories, but won only one. Andy Rex was named television technician of the year for his \"utterly captivating, beautifully framed\" depiction of the Mozambique floods. The BBC's Nine O'Clock News coverage of the Zimbabwe farm invasions won the international news award, while News 24 took the news event award for its coverage of the Belgrade revolution. BBC's Tim Sebastian and Nicola Pearson, were named interviewer of the year and young journalist of the year respectively. BBC2's Correspondent scooped the international current affairs award for Licence to Kill, an investigation into honour killing of women in Pakistan. Panorama won the home current affairs award for Who Bombed Omagh? and BBC Northern Ireland took the regional current affairs award. ITV's flagship current affairs show Tonight with Trevor McDonald failed to receive a single nomination. ITN's Channel 4 News team scooped the home news award for its Hatfield train crash coverage, the production award for its approach to photojournalism, and the specialist journalist award for Nicholas Glass. Scottish Television's Scotland Today landed the best regional daily news magazine programme award.",

And although some of those adult-size youngsters buying child tickets for buses and underground trains are on a scam, they aren't all. It isn't just the up-and-coming generation. The human race has been reaching higher and higher for centuries, but the sheer speed of our upward growth has only been dramatically obvious since proper record keeping began. </p> <p>We all know that we'd never squeeze into those pint-sized suits of armour which these days fail to loom menacingly in the corners of castle halls, and we can only wonder at the short stature of whoever used to walk through Norman arches. But it isn't until you hear that the average teenage boy is now around nine inches taller than someone of his age would have been in 1837, that the scale of what has been happening is apparent. </p> <p>That figure comes from an internet survey of 5,000 seven to 16-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, released by the Office for National Statistics and the Centre for Statistical Education at Nottingham Trent University, who compared the average height of a 15-year-old boy today, at 5ft 8in, with that of children working in factories in 1837. </p> <p>According to Peter Hindmarsh, reader in paediatric endocrinology at Great Ormond Street hospital and University College London, there has been evidence of a generally upwards trend throughout the history of the human race, although with the odd downward dip usually thanks to rampant disease. But it is hard to be precise about size, because the skeletons discovered are usually those of the best nourished and most affluent individuals of the era. In the past couple of hundred years, however, we have been compiling much more precise data. </p> <p>\"There have been quite marked secular trends [a steady increase] in height in western Europe from the 19th century. The best documented are in the Scandinavian countries from about 1870 onwards where the average increment is about 1.5cm per generation,\" he says. Given 20 years or so for a generation, this suggests 7.5cm a century, or around three inches. </p> <p>We are what we eat, and our height is strongly linked to nutrition. The changing stature of various groups whose eating habits have changed with migration bears this out very strongly. The first generation of Japanese born to parents who had moved to California virtually immediately mimicked the growth patterns of American children. Something similar is happening to the children of Asian groups in the UK, although more slowly. It is not only migrant Japanese who are growing taller - there was a major growth spurt among children in the indigenous Japanese population between 1950 and 1990, which some experts have put down to increased milk consumption after the second world war. Interestingly, all the increase was in leg length, which is the most rapidly growing part of the body in early childhood. </p> <p>Height is one of the rare things which is not genetically determined. The children of affluent parents in the developing world grow just as tall as those in the developed world. Height is dependent not on the quantity of food we eat as babies and children, but on the quality - the amount of protein, fats, vitamins and minerals. The red-meat eaters of Australia and the United States tend to breed tall children. Poor diet and exposure to infection keep children small. Infections can lead to gastrointestinal damage, which prevents babies and small children absorbing the nutrients their bodies need for bone growth. At the very least, they lead to loss of appetite. </p> <p>Bigger babies are likely to grow taller, but mainly because their size at birth indicates that their mother has been well-nourished during pregnancy. It is birth weight, height and weight of the mother, in fact, that makes the most significant difference to the height of the child. </p> <p>But also significant is the attention the mother pays to the child. This is not as mysterious as it sounds - the more time the mother has to spend on the child, the more likely she is to feed him or her well and encourage his or her appetite. So first-born babies do better, because there are no small siblings to make demands of the mother, and babies born into affluent families do well, because there is money for good food, less chance of infection and usually fewer children or more adults with the time to fuss over them. </p> <p>As we in the west grow more affluent and are better fed, will we, like Alice Through the Looking Glass, find ourselves outgrowing our houses as we have already outgrown the Norman doorways? Maybe not. \"In the UK we are slowing down if anything,\" says Peter Hindmarsh. \"There is probably a limit to how tall we can get. The trend has virtually stopped in Scandinavia. The only nation where it continues to rise is in the Netherlands.\" But why the Dutch are continuing to grow taller, he does not know. </p> <p>And there is something else. What makes us think size matters? There is evidence that tall people are more likely to suffer heart disease in later life than short people.

I consented a patient for the wrong operation last week (although he had the right one). </p> <p>Perhaps this is karma in action. </p> <p>I struggle to work out which of our team it is whose appearance has so offended him.

The temptation is great. </p> <p>In the event, I belly out and decide not to mention it at all. Does this make me a conspirator? The patient seemed to think so. \"I'd like a bit of that,\" he said to me that afternoon on his way back from theatre in the lift, pointing at a physiotherapist's behind. </p> <p>\"Know what I mean, 'ey, doc?\" he continued, as if I was his best mate. </p> <p>While everyone else in the lift stared at me in astonishment. </p> <p>This, I should point out, is the only interesting thing that has happened to me in three weeks. Apart from the novelty of having patients under the age of 70, being a surgical house officer is so tedious that on some afternoons I have almost gnawed my own leg off with boredom, and the only relief comes when I am on call and get to see patients fresh in A&amp;E. </p> <p>The basic problem with surgery is that unless you're into the railway modelling aspect of it all, it's a bit of a one-laugh gag. I can still remember the first time I went to theatre as a medical student, being amazed at how counter-intuitive it was to stick a knife into somebody's guts: it was all I could do to stop myself reaching out and grabbing the surgeon's hand as it zoomed in on the patient's tummy and saying: \"Are you mad? You were going to cut that bloke's tummy open with that knife!

His faintly highlighted hair has been coiffeured with gel and he is clean shaven. But none of it works - he still hates his looks. Which is why he is on a quest for the perfect face: he wants to have cosmetic surgery to transform himself into someone comparable to a male model. Someone he describes as \"classically good-looking\". </p> <p>The first thing that strikes you about Whitfield-Lyne is how attractive he is. Square-faced, with deep-set hazel eyes (when he's not wearing his blue-tint contacts), it's difficult not to offer reassurances of how fine - no, better than fine - his looks are. \"This is something that I get a lot,\" he says, when I blurt out that I don't know what the problem is. \"I think everybody expects me to be like Quasimodo or something.

When one news agency sent his story down the wires and around the world last week, he was sent hate mail from across the continents. \"Freak\" was the most common insult, but accusations of conceit and vanity featured pretty frequently too. Yes, he says, the enterprise is based on vanity. But his argument is it's more of \"a negative vanity. It's not looking in the mirror and thinking: 'Wow, you look really great today.' It's quite the opposite. I look in the mirror and think: 'This isn't the way I want to look.' \" </p> <p>With a series of operations, Whitfield-Lyne thinks he can satisfactorily metamorphose. From the chin up, we're looking at a collagen injection in his top lip (\"Just to fatten it up. To sort of bring balance to my top and bottom lip\"), and fat removal from the area above his lip (\"because it protrudes\"). He needs work on his \"sunken cheeks\" (\"obviously I want implants there\"), and needs his eyes slightly widened (\"I've got small eyes. Can you see?\"). </p> <p>When it comes to hair growth, he wants his hairline rounded and moved forward so he can wear if off his face (\"I can't at the moment because it looks slightly odd\") and he wants laser hair removal on his chin (\"How many men would love to wake up in the morning and never have to shave? I'm sorry Gillette, but that's the way it is.\") He demonstrates these effects by puffing, pouting and pulling at himself. \"Watch. Watch my face,\" he says as he drags his skin up and bloats out his cheeks like a bull-frog. \"Yeah? Do you see? Have I proved that to you?\" </p> <p>When he can afford it he'd like to have cosmetic dentistry to level off his teeth and make them whiter. And if he had the money, he would probably have pectoral implants as well. But this is all in the future. For now he's focusing on the facial tweaks. He has done his sums and puts the total cost at around \u00a320,000. To raise the cash, he's appealing for business sponsors. He is also in talks about having the process filmed for a documentary, conforming, as it does, to the British television's appetite for \"unique social experiments\". </p> <p>\"It's a bit of a test from my point of view,\" he says. \"I want to look differently anyway, but if the latest cosmetic surgery techniques can be used to transform, OK, an average to reasonably good-looking guy into someone that is classically good-looking - such as a model - then that's a real experiment. Can surgery actually transform someone that dramatically but still look as natural as possible? I believe it can. I'm convinced of it, because of Cindy Jackson.\" </p> <p>Cindy Jackson is the world's most surgically-enhanced woman, having knotched up a total of 38 cosmetic operations. Whitfield-Lyne evidently hero-worships her, telling me, at various intervals, how \"drop dead gorgeous\" and \"ever so nice\" she is. When he first came across her website he read it from page to page thinking how he totally related to this lady. A few months ago they struck up an email relationship and now Jackson is knee-deep in the Whitfield-Lyne project, serving as chief advisor and narrator to the possible documentary. </p> <p>\"We get on really well,\" he says. \"People see her as a bimbo or an idiot but she's a member of Mensa. She's a very astute sharp woman, but she's also a very compassionate and lovely woman and she cares about other people and she advises people all over the world about cosmetic surgery. I mean, she really is a babe. She does modelling and everything.\" </p> <p>Jackson also came to her disciple's defence during a recent appearance on an early morning chatshow, where much of the audience rounded on him for his intentions. Like many people he meets, the host was trying to find some sort of deep-rooted, psychological motive for the surgery. They focused on his adoption and proposed his actions imply he is trying to erase all traces of his natural family from his physical appearance. \"That sort of stuff is absolute rubbish,\" he says. \"I can't see the relevance there at all.\" </p> <p>Neither can he relate to a diagnosis of body dysmorphia - an irrational conviction that one's body is repulsive. As I read out the checklist of \"beliefs\" for the disease (\"no amount of operations will ever be enough to put things right\"; \"exterior appearance counts for more than personality\"), Whitfield-Lyne dismisses them, claiming that he doesn't empathise with those tenets. \"Personality is more important. But I don't think anyone can like me if I don't like me.\" </p> <p>Go through pictures of idolised men with Whitfield-Lyne and it's easier to envisage what he deems attractive. Brad Pitt gets the thumbs up, as does Jude Law. But George Clooney only just passes the test (\"he's OK - for his age\") and, as for Russell Crowe: \"Well, you wouldn't see him at Select modelling agency.\" All of which proves nothing except that he, like everyone else, sees appearance as a question of taste. </p> <p>Will Tim Whitfield-Lyne become irresistible? Will he - as he so desperately wants - walk into a room and be deemed the most attractive man there? Probably not. But nothing anyone says will stop him trying. \"I have an idea of what I'd like to look like,\" he says, \"and if it can be produced - if I can prove cosmetic surgery works and that it can give someone a very, very attractive face - then maybe I am the male version of Cindy Jackson.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Don't try this at home, folks: the Lazarus effect is a capricious one. The 13-month-old Canadian baby who came back to life this week, after apparently freezing to death, was lucky. Erika Nordby, who somehow toddled out of the backdoor of a house in the middle of the night in sub-zero conditions - in only a nappy - was \"frozen solid\" when her mother Leyla found her a few hours later. But Erika had \"died\" at the right temperature (the air temperature was minus 24C; her body temperature had gone down to 16C). And she was a baby. </p> <p>The membranes of the cells of a baby's tissue are just that much more flexible, according to Nancy Rothwell, a physiologist at the University of Manchester, and are more likely to survive the formation of ice fragments within them. \"But the big thing is being exactly the right temperature, and that was absolutely luck,\" she says. </p> <p>Freezing is very, very dangerous: lower the temperature and the blood starts to clot, which can lead to kidney damage (babies once again are much more likely recover). But some other things go your way. Oxygen requirements fall dramatically off as body temperature falls. So lower the temperature in a controlled way - they do it on the operating table every day - and there can be virtually no circulation, and virtually no heartbeat for a period, yet the brain will survive. </p> <p>People with severe head injuries who have fallen into snow and frozen a bit have survived when others at room temperature have died. This has been so noticeable that doctors have tried chilling head injury victims to enhance their survival. Once again, when it works, it tends to work for the young; the older ones get kidney and cardiovascular problems. But the ones who survive this are more likely to recover from brain injury. At a lower temperature, the oxygen requirement falls 10-fold. </p> <p>First the fingers and toes go numb, and then the limbs, because the body reacts to keep the vital organs warm: this is the core temperature at the heart of human survival. Oxygen consumption falls, blood thickens, fluids retreat to the centre, the kidneys work overtime: people who are cold become conscious of a need to urinate. </p> <p>At 31C (well below normal body temperature) hallucinations begin. Nazi doctors experimenting with cold water baths at Dachau established death at a core temperature of about 25C. But there have been dramatic tales of children surviving at far lower temperatures. In 1994, a two-year-old girl in Saskatchewan was found with her limbs frozen solid, her core temperature at 14C. She lived. </p> <p>The same principle keeps hibernating polar bears alive through the long Arctic night. \"They lower their body temperature, the heart rate goes down to say, two a minute, and they manage to survive because they have such low requirements,\" says Prof Rothwell. The mammalian machinery that keeps bears going as a matter of evolutionary course could also occasionally work its magic for humans caught in the snow. </p> <p>\"Most enzyme activities in the body double with every 10C change. So if you drop by 10C you have halved all chemical reaction, and if you drop 10C more you halve again. Probably if they were around 5C or 8C core, they could survive.

      "bodyText": "Don't try this at home, folks: the Lazarus effect is a capricious one. The 13-month-old Canadian baby who came back to life this week, after apparently freezing to death, was lucky. Erika Nordby, who somehow toddled out of the backdoor of a house in the middle of the night in sub-zero conditions - in only a nappy - was \"frozen solid\" when her mother Leyla found her a few hours later. But Erika had \"died\" at the right temperature (the air temperature was minus 24C; her body temperature had gone down to 16C). And she was a baby. The membranes of the cells of a baby's tissue are just that much more flexible, according to Nancy Rothwell, a physiologist at the University of Manchester, and are more likely to survive the formation of ice fragments within them. \"But the big thing is being exactly the right temperature, and that was absolutely luck,\" she says. Freezing is very, very dangerous: lower the temperature and the blood starts to clot, which can lead to kidney damage (babies once again are much more likely recover). But some other things go your way. Oxygen requirements fall dramatically off as body temperature falls. So lower the temperature in a controlled way - they do it on the operating table every day - and there can be virtually no circulation, and virtually no heartbeat for a period, yet the brain will survive. People with severe head injuries who have fallen into snow and frozen a bit have survived when others at room temperature have died. This has been so noticeable that doctors have tried chilling head injury victims to enhance their survival. Once again, when it works, it tends to work for the young; the older ones get kidney and cardiovascular problems. But the ones who survive this are more likely to recover from brain injury. At a lower temperature, the oxygen requirement falls 10-fold. First the fingers and toes go numb, and then the limbs, because the body reacts to keep the vital organs warm: this is the core temperature at the heart of human survival. Oxygen consumption falls, blood thickens, fluids retreat to the centre, the kidneys work overtime: people who are cold become conscious of a need to urinate. At 31C (well below normal body temperature) hallucinations begin. Nazi doctors experimenting with cold water baths at Dachau established death at a core temperature of about 25C. But there have been dramatic tales of children surviving at far lower temperatures. In 1994, a two-year-old girl in Saskatchewan was found with her limbs frozen solid, her core temperature at 14C. She lived. The same principle keeps hibernating polar bears alive through the long Arctic night. \"They lower their body temperature, the heart rate goes down to say, two a minute, and they manage to survive because they have such low requirements,\" says Prof Rothwell. The mammalian machinery that keeps bears going as a matter of evolutionary course could also occasionally work its magic for humans caught in the snow. \"Most enzyme activities in the body double with every 10C change. So if you drop by 10C you have halved all chemical reaction, and if you drop 10C more you halve again. Probably if they were around 5C or 8C core, they could survive. There is a lot of luck involved, being at the right temperature, after cooling at the right rate, and then rewarming at the right rate - and the risk was in the rewarming. But it can happen, and it has happened. They were clinically dead, of course, by the criteria we used, but not obviously really dead because they could function again.\" In her 1998 televised Royal Institution lectures, Prof Rothwell lowered a PhD student into freezing water to make a point about physiology. She also pointed to Canadian frogs that did, literally, freeze. \"They were frozen solid in the ice, and then they gradually thawed and just woke up.

      "bodyText": "The European Commission has given the go-ahead to two new funding schemes that could generate hundreds of millions of pounds of new investment for regenerating brownfield land in England. Under the so-called \"gap funding\" schemes, ministers provide aid for private companies to help them redevelop contaminated, derelict and disused sites that might not otherwise be profitable. The new schemes allow the government to break out of a European funding straightjacket that meant ministers could only provide gap funding for projects in the country's poorest areas. Now small and medium-sized businesses across the country will be able to benefit - increasing the range and number of sites that can receive gap funding. The schemes will partly replace the government's partnership investment programme (PIP), which was closed in 1999 because Brussels felt the money gave UK businesses an unfair advantage over their continental rivals. Commissioners decided to limit the amount of funding the UK government could hand out, and confined the scheme to assisted areas - those such as Cornwall - that receive funding from Europe aimed at supporting the continent's poorest regions. The new schemes allow businesses with less than 250 staff to benefit from state aid no matter where in England their regeneration project is situated. Larger firms will only be able to claim help if they are redeveloping sites within assisted areas. Mike Shields, chief executive of the Northwest Development Agency, which will help administer the gap funding programmes, said: \"These new schemes don't go all the way to replacing the PIP, but they go a long way. It's really good news, I'm telling you.\" Mr Shields estimates that the new schemes could mean an extra \u00a3200m in public and private money is invested in brownfield land across the country next year. The schemes will provide a range of government support for regeneration programmes in which the final user of the development is already known, or in which the development is due to be sold on the open market. The local government minister, Hilary Armstrong, said: \"This will allow us to harness the expertise and commercial awareness of the private sector, achieving better value for money for tax payers.\" The government is still in negotiations with the commission over a new regeneration framework under which state aid could be further extended.",

On a day when the nation was numbed by yet another tragedy, viewers switched on in their droves to watch both ITV and BBC news. But the absence of News at Ten delivered a clear public relations victory to the BBC's 10 O'Clock News in the key late evening slot. The bulletin, presented by Peter Sissons, scooped 7.5m viewers and a third of audience share at 10pm. ITV's News at 10.25pm pulled in only 4.6m and a 26% share. ITV didn't ignore the event - it made a late change to its early evening schedule slipping in a news special between Coronation Street and its movie Bean. That pulled in 8m viewers - the biggest news audience for ITV this year. Yesterday's Selby rail crash, the deepening foot and mouth crisis, an earthquake in Seattle and England's 3-0 victory against Spain made for the busiest news day since the resignation of Peter Mandelson. ITV's Popstars documentary, which displaced the news, attracted 5.7m viewers between 9.40pm and 10.25pm. Channel 4's new series of ER - featuring Dr Carter's continuing struggles with drug abuse - failed to generate the sort of audiences the show enjoyed at its height.

      "bodyText": "The government must curb the student nurse drop-out rate and improve training courses if it is to meet recruitment targets, two major reports warn today. Some nursing courses have a drop-out rate of nearly 40% and on average one in six students does not complete training. Researchers said the numbers not finishing their nursing degree were worryingly high as vocational courses generally have lower drop-out rates than other subjects. The government's NHS plan set a target of increasing the number of nurses in the health service by 20,000 over the next five years, while also filling the vacancies created by nurses quitting the profession or retiring. It is also aiming to reduce the drop-out rates for nurses and midwives to 13% this year. But the two reports - by the National Audit Office (NAO) and the audit commission - put both targets in doubt. The NAO report focuses on student nurses, while the audit commission investigated the training and development of qualified staff in the NHS. The government pledged to train an extra 5,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors a year to meet the NHS plan recruitment target and the extra staff are key to meet other action priorities in the plan, such as faster treatment and improved care for patients. However, the reports concluded that the ambitious targets could be still be achieved - but only if the drop-out rate was reduced and investment in education and training increased. Both reports said the Department of Health had a package of measures to ensure problems were being addressed, but warned that changes and improvements were needed for the promises in the NHS plan to be delivered. The audit commission report found that in the majority of NHS trusts, at least a third of nurses had not updated their skills in basic life support. One in five trusts uses less than three-quarters of the training places for qualified nurses available to them, meaning millions of pounds dedicated to funding post-qualification training are going to waste each year. Meanwhile, the NAO report said some universities offering nursing courses are already reaching full capacity. Wide variations in the cost of training were also revealed in the report, with some universities charging five times more than others to educate each nurse. Many colleges are finding it increasingly difficult to get enough good-quality practice placements in hospitals for their students, partly because of chronic staff shortages in the NHS, meaning there are not enough staff to supervise students. The problems in finding proper work placements is limiting the expansion of training places and could threaten the proposed increase in student numbers. A statement by the NAO said: \"Sir John Bourn [head of the NAO] has concluded that delivery of the planned expansion in the numbers of new staff undergoing training depends on increased investment in teaching staff and accommodation at higher education institutions; achieving improved value for money in the provision of training courses; a reduction in student drop-out rates and a larger number of good-quality practice placements.\" Health minister John Denham said: \"These reports identify good practice and also highlight the fact that we have already taken action in the areas where there is room for improvement. \"We are committed to ensuring high quality education, training and development for all NHS staff. \"Well-trained staff are key to modernising the NHS and providing patients with high-quality services.\" This year there were 50,000 nursing and midwifery students in training, as well as 14,000 others on other healthcare courses. At the same time, nurse vacancies within the NHS have risen from 7,300 in 1999 to 10,000 last year. Nursing unions' research shows health service bureaucracy is the main cause of dissatisfaction among those who decide to quit the profession or take early retirement - rather than pay and conditions. The unions say many nurses opt for a career change because of the demands of frequently changing priorities imposed by NHS managers responding to government policy.",

LWT staged one riot in north London last night and it will shoot more scenes involving clashes between the black community and the police tonight. The scenes are inspired by the riots in Brixton, Toxteth and Broadwater Farm in the 1980s. The production team last night used a housing estate in Hendon, north London, to stage scenes of a raging mob battling with riot police. Pyrotechnic experts created bursts petrol flames. Tonight, a south London police station is to be used as the scene for more race-related violence. Around 100 extras took part in the riot scenes. The production is the latest adaptation by script writer Andrew Davies, who was behind the acclaimed TV versions of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Kingsley Amis's Take a Girl Like You. The adaptation is bound to upset Shakespeare purists - Othello is portrayed as the first black commissioner of the Metropolitan police. Mr Davies, who is notorious for embellishing literary classics, is also planning to include some racy scenes of Othello \"making the beast with two backs\" with Desdemona. Eamonn Walker plays John Othello, with Christopher Ecclestone as his angry lieutentant Jago and Keeley Hawes as his wife Dessie. The drama is being directed by Geoffrey Sax, who was behind the acclaimed series Clocking Off starring Sarah Lancashire.",

      "body": "<p>In their book The Collapse Of Chaos, Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart tried to explain that the apparent simplicities of our commonsense view of the world hid a teeming ocean of complexity. \"If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them,\" they wrote, \"we'd be so simple that we couldn't.\" Britain in the 21st century is a bit like that. If the web of electricity cables, microwaves, rails, roads, airways, computers, fibre-optic links, retailers, distributors, sewage systems, phone lines, warning systems, farmers and manufacturers was simple enough for us to understand it, it would be too simple to exist.</p> <p>We only notice the complexity of the technology we have come to rely on when it stops working. We only marvel at smooth roads and cars travelling along them at 90 miles an hour when they are blocked by snow.

      "bodyText": "In their book The Collapse Of Chaos, Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart tried to explain that the apparent simplicities of our commonsense view of the world hid a teeming ocean of complexity. \"If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them,\" they wrote, \"we'd be so simple that we couldn't.\" Britain in the 21st century is a bit like that. If the web of electricity cables, microwaves, rails, roads, airways, computers, fibre-optic links, retailers, distributors, sewage systems, phone lines, warning systems, farmers and manufacturers was simple enough for us to understand it, it would be too simple to exist. We only notice the complexity of the technology we have come to rely on when it stops working. We only marvel at smooth roads and cars travelling along them at 90 miles an hour when they are blocked by snow. We only realise the incredible level of mechanisation and international animal-shuffling of modern farming when a disease breaks out in livestock at opposite ends of the country and rural life shuts down. We only remember that it is complicated to have hundreds of people and tonnes of goods, travelling in four different directions, on two levels, in two different kinds of transport, in all weathers, at combined speeds of hundreds of miles an hour, when they collide and people are killed.

      "bodyText": "Labour and Tory posters are failing to achieve the level of impact they got in the run-up to the 1997 election. Outdoor specialist Concord said the latest political posters were scoring much lower recall levels among the public than those recorded for the previous general election. This year's posters are scoring a recall average of 41 points out of 100, compared with 71 points in 1997. It is a far cry from the 80-point impact made by the Conservatives' infamous \"demon eyes\" poster by M&amp;C Saatchi in 1997. Concord has measured the impact of the posters on several criteria: branding, colour and contrast, imagery, clarity of message, involvement and overall impact. Labour's current campaign was created by TBWA/London and uses a pair of scissors to illustrate Tory cuts. The Conservative campaign by Yellow M features a photo of a teacher engulfed with paperwork and promises teachers will not be pen pushers under the Tories.

      "bodyText": "The first cases of foot and mouth disease in Scotland were confirmed today as fears grow that the virus may have also taken hold across the Irish Sea. Farms in Lockerbie and Canonbie, in Dumfries and Galloway, have been hit, along with Longtown, Cumbria, officials said. Irish agriculture department officials are investigating suspicions that fraud was involved in the movement of a consignment of 248 lambs from a suspected contaminated farm in Northern Ireland. In Britain, four more cases were expected to be confirmed later today, including one in Northern Ireland, two in Carlisle and one in County Durham, the chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore said. Eight new incidents of the disease were confirmed elsewhere on the British mainland yesterday. The alarm was raised in Northern Ireland yesterday as 200 sheep at a farm at Meigh, South Armagh, on the Irish border, were discovered to have been imported after being bought at a market in Carlisle. Farmers feared the worst after 21 sheep were discovered with symptoms of the disease. The flock was destroyed and incinerated while a livestock importer and dealer were being questioned on suspicion that they breached animal movement regulations. In the Republic of Ireland, the suspected lambs were delivered to the Kepak meat plant, at Athleague, county Roscommon - one of the Irish republic's biggest sheep and meat processing factories - last Tuesday, and were slaughtered immediately. They were delivered in the name of a Roscommon sheep farmer but subsequent investigations by the department have established that the animals did not belong to the man whose name was used. The disease has not been in Ireland for 60 years. The total number of animals slaughtered or due to be destroyed in Britain is believed to stand at 11,000, with 102 farms around the country under restrictions. The new cases have brought the total to 29, as Mr Scudamore admitted it was \"impossible\" to predict how many more cases could be expected. The latest outbreaks were at a cattle and sheep farm in on the Warwickshire-Leicestershire border; a sheep and pig farm in Essex; two Welsh farms in Powys; a farm in Herefordshire; an abattoir near Preston, Lancashire; a sheep farm in Leicestershire and another sheep farm in Devon. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, insisted measures to contain the disease, including the ban on moving livestock, were working as all but one of the new cases were linked to existing outbreaks. Despite Tuesday's announcement to extend the nationwide movement ban for a further two weeks from Friday, Mr Brown said he was still determined to introduce special measures on Friday allowing some uninfected animals to be transported to abattoirs and enter the human food chain. Cattle and sheep will also be held at sterilised collection centres before being sent for slaughter, although pigs, which are more likely to carry the disease, will only be sent directly to abattoirs. The move was welcomed by the National Farmers' Union president, Ben Gill, who said the scheme was \"badly needed\" to continue putting British meat on shop shelves. A compensation package for farmers of \u00a3170m has been announced by the government. In Germany, agriculture officials confirmed that sheep imported from the UK had shown signs of the disease although more extensive tests on further animals were negative.

US police said they were investigating allegations that Richard Allen had sexually molested two teenage sisters at his home while they were babysitting. A 13-year-old girl said an assault took place at Mr Allen's home in November last year. Her 14-year-old sister later said she had also been molested. Mr Allen is being held on $100,000 (\u00a371,000) bail at a detention centre in southern California. The arrest comes just seven days after detectives quizzed Judith Kilshaw, the British woman at the centre of the internet adoption affair, over the alleged theft of travellers' cheques used to fund the trip to the US with her husband Alan. Mrs Kilshaw was released on police bail without charge. The two couples hit the headlines after it emerged that the Allens claimed already to have adopted the baby girls before the Kilshaws took them to Britain. Mr Allen, who served a writ on the British couple after they appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show, claims that he and his wife, Vicky, paid a fee to adopt the twin girls when they were six months old. He says the Kilshaws then abducted the children and took them to Wales. In their defence, Mr and Mrs Kilshaw said they had used the internet to find the girls but they had not discovered the babies were already with Mr and Mrs Allen until they travelled to San Diego, California, to adopt them. At this point Mr and Mrs Allen say the twins were snatched back by their biological mother, Tranda Wecker, 28, a twice-divorced hotel receptionist, and an internet adoption broker Tina Johnson. In a fourth investigation, Mr and Mrs Kilshaw visited Mold police station in north Wales last week to provide statements about Ms Johnson. Mr and Mrs Kilshaw were reported to have paid Ms Johnson a \"non-refundable arrangement fee\" of \u00a38,200 after she promised to find a child for them.",

      "bodyText": "A London council is threatening to take legal action against sports giant Nike over an illegal flyposting campaign as the government plans a national crackdown on the practice. The move signals a new crackdown on global corporations that are willing to break the law to get products as mundane as catfood and noodles noticed. The challenge to Nike is the latest move by Westminster city council to counter the flyposters. It has been particularly active in its efforts to fight the practice and recently introduced a type of paint that makes it impossible for billboards to be posted on its property. It is planning to increase its budget for fighting the flyposters by \u00a3200,000 this year. \"We are beginning to consider the origins of the problem and look at how we can target the culprits,\" said a Westminster council spokesman. \"Practices like this create an atmosphere that makes it easier for crime to breed. Flyposting is technically illegal but, until recently, many councils turned a blind eye, reasoning that no real harm was being done.\" The huge increase in the number of multinationals using flyposters - along with the establishment of specialist agencies dedicated to the practice - has led to a crackdown in both local and national government. The Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions recently introduced guidelines for councils that explain the kind of action they can take. These include how to recoup the cost of cleaning up from the advertisers themselves. A spokesman for the department said it was hoping to increase government powers in the area as soon as possible. \"We definitely want to toughen up on this,\" he said. Flyposting, once limited to independent record labels and music promoters, has expanded in recent years. Major blue-chip companies such as Mars and Unilever are now just as likely to get involved in the practice. Current campaigns plastered up on walls around London include those for Whiskas catfood and Batchelors Supernoodles. Both campaigns are designed to look as if they have come from small rebellious companies unable to afford billboard advertising. No one at Batchelors was available for comment and a spokesperson for Mars, which owns Whiskas, said the company was not willing to comment on its involvement in illegal flyposting. However, a recent press release issued on behalf of Whiskas said the company was embarking on a \"guerilla\" marketing campaign that would include flyposting.",

      "bodyText": "An American father who is taking a Welsh couple to court over the custody of twin girls bought on the internet has been arrested on suspicion of child abuse. US police said they were investigating allegations that Richard Allen had sexually molested two teenage sisters at his home while they were babysitting. A 13-year-old girl said an assault took place at Mr Allen's home in November last year. Her 14-year-old sister later said she had also been molested. Mr Allen is being held on $100,000 (\u00a371,000) bail at a detention centre in southern California. The arrest comes just seven days after detectives quizzed Judith Kilshaw, the British woman at the centre of the internet adoption affair, over the alleged theft of travellers' cheques used to fund the trip to the US with her husband Alan. Mrs Kilshaw was released on police bail without charge. The two couples hit the headlines after it emerged that the Allens claimed already to have adopted the baby girls before the Kilshaws took them to Britain. Mr Allen, who served a writ on the British couple after they appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show, claims that he and his wife, Vicky, paid a fee to adopt the twin girls when they were six months old. He says the Kilshaws then abducted the children and took them to Wales. In their defence, Mr and Mrs Kilshaw said they had used the internet to find the girls but they had not discovered the babies were already with Mr and Mrs Allen until they travelled to San Diego, California, to adopt them. At this point Mr and Mrs Allen say the twins were snatched back by their biological mother, Tranda Wecker, 28, a twice-divorced hotel receptionist, and an internet adoption broker Tina Johnson. In a fourth investigation, Mr and Mrs Kilshaw visited Mold police station in north Wales last week to provide statements about Ms Johnson. Mr and Mrs Kilshaw were reported to have paid Ms Johnson a \"non-refundable arrangement fee\" of \u00a38,200 after she promised to find a child for them.

      "bodyText": "Hi-tech investment firm Durlacher has found itself \u00a314m out of pocket after a spate of bad investments in internet companies. In less than a year, its market value has plummeted to \u00a362m - a far cry from the \u00a32bn valuation it enjoyed during its heyday. Total pre-tax losses for the six months to December 31 were \u00a313.9m from a profit of \u00a35m and revenues of \u00a36.7m. The loss included write-offs of \u00a313m, prompted by the dramatic change in the investment climate that wrong-footed Durlacher. The past year has been a tough one for Durlacher - 18 months ago it was one of the leading lights of the dot.com boom, boasting a valuation of more than \u00a32bn. The value of its investments now stands at no more than \u00a332m. Durlacher is now said to be in talks with a competitor about a merger and hopes to have signed a deal by August. \"We remain focused on achieving our strategic objective of creating a premier European emerging technology and new media investment group,\" said Geoffrey Chamberlain, chairman of Durlacher. He was responsible for turning Durlacher from a small stockbroker into a leading investment group. Durlacher shares sank 11% on the back of the six-month figures to reach 14p, down from a peak of \u00a33.94 last year. Durlacher said it would now focus on Nothing-ventured.com, its own online brokerage service. However, it will continue to pursue IPO agendas or trade sales for its investees, which include Talkcast, the451.com, Popworld, Shopsmart, Online Travel Corporation and 365.

      "bodyText": "Pictures of cancer-ridden lungs may cover 30% of the surface of a cigarette packet under new European Union laws. New rules on marketing tobacco will mean all cigarettes sold in the EU from 2003 must have a health warning covering almost a third of the packet. Current UK warnings cover as little as 4% of the packet. The wording will also take on a more explicit tone - with phrases such as \"Smokers die younger\" or \"Smoking severely harms you and those around you\". Under the new law, individual governments can demand that the harmful effects of tobacco on the body are graphically illustrated on cigarette packets. Words such as \"light\", \"mild\" and \"low tar\" will be banned from cigarette marketing. It will mean that brands such as Marlboro Lights and Camel Lights will either have to change their names or be sold outside the EU. Marlboro Lights manufacturer Philip Morris said it would change the name of the product if the law required it. EU health and consumer protection commissioner David Byrne said the new laws should reduce the number of smokers in Europe. He hoped it would bring down the number of smokers from one in three of the adult population to the US level of less than one in five. Related story Feb 15: Clampdown on tobacco loopholes",

He left the ground before the second half and went to his parents' home in Lurgan, where there is newly scripted graffiti on a wall that reads \"Neil Lennon RIP\". Rumours circulated that he has decided never to play for his country again. But Sammy McIlroy, the manager, denied it. \"No one has said anything to me,\" he said. \"As far as I'm concerned he'll be in the squad for the next game. \"I've heard worse and there were cheers as well as boos. But it's part and parcel of the game. I actually thought it would have been a hell of a lot worse, the way people were talking about it.\" McIlroy had plenty of other things to worry about after the heaviest defeat of his 14- month reign, such as the \"non-existent\" defence that allowed Norway three simple goals in the first half. They changed to a flat back four for the second period, but within four minutes Thorstein Helstad's second goal of the night had killed the game. \"That is the worse performance that I have had here as a manager,\" said McIlroy. Northern Ireland (3-5-2): Taylor (Fulham); Hughes (Newcastle), Taggart (Leicester; Griffin , Dundee Utd, h-t), Murdoch (Preston); McCarthy (Birmingham; Johnson , Blackburn, 62min), Magilton (Ipswich), Lennon (Celtic; Elliott , Motherwell, h-t), Whitley (Manchester City; Sonner , Birmingham, 66), Kennedy (Watford; Williams , Wimbledon, h-t); Healy (Preston; Kirk , Hearts, 69), Ferguson (Linfield; Gray , Oxford, 69). Norway (4-5-1): Myhre; Bergdolmo, Lundekvam, Stensaas, Berg (Eggen, h-t); Solskjaer (Aarsheim, 77), Tessem, Larsen, Bakke, Helstad (Berre, 77); Carew (Andersen, 77). Referee: K Clark (Scotland).",

And in a move that reflects men's magazines' increasing leaning toward lad culture, the comic is now being classified as a \"men's lifestyle\" title. WH Smith has confirmed it will move the magazine, published by John Brown Publishing, from its adult humour/graphic novel ghetto and on to the lower shelves beside Loaded, FHM and Maxim. Ed Axon, publisher of Viz, said the move highlighted today's more tolerant attitudes towards taste and decency. \"There has been a major shift in public attitudes towards what is seen as acceptable over the past 10-15 years,\" he said. \"This is reflected in the controversial content of most men's magazines. It's therefore right Viz has been repositioned to join the men's lifestyle section. \"I am only thankful for WH Smith's measured approach to the subject.\" Viz, which was started by Chris and Simon Donald, became one of the publishing sensations of the 80s when it accelerated the backlash against political correctness.

      "bodyText": "Disney has wielded the axe across its internet operations for the second time in as many months. This latest round of cuts have spread to Soccernet, Disney's football website in the UK. Soccernet was one of the first and best-known football websites in the UK and was originally owned by Daily Mail publisher Associated Newspapers. However, the newspaper publisher bailed out and sold the service to Disney who wanted to use it as a promotional tool for its ESPN sports TV network. It is believed almost half of Soccernet's staff, including the entire marketing and PR department, and some sales staff, have left this week. A skeleton salesforce and a handful of editorial staff are left running the site. \"Soccernet has always been a very lean ship,\" said Soccernet editor Mike With. \"We've not grown as much as other sites in this sector so there's not much to cut back on.\" The reorganisation is part of a second round of cutbacks at Disney, which axed 400 jobs and its flagship portal Go.com only last month. The cuts this week hit 135 jobs and ABCNews.com and ABC.com. Disney Internet Group chairman Steve Bornstein said the cuts would help the company operate \"in a more efficient and streamlined manner\" to help it move towards profitability. In less than a month, the group has slashed the size of its workforce by around 25%. It started the year with 2,100 employees and is now down to 1,500. Tellingly, even when announcing the latest cuts, Disney bosses made no promises that these would be the last. Disney bought 60% of Soccernet for \u00a315m from Associated New Media in late 1999, then topped this up with the remaining 40% in August last year. Soccernet was only recently brought further into the Disney group through stronger ties and cross-promotion with subsidiary EPSN. Related story Feb 6: Disney counts cost of online losses",

One group is tackling Dickens's Little Dorrit in instalments, to recreate the excitement of Victorian readers, for whom the book was serialised. And a group in Britain with time to spare is inching through James Joyce's Ulysses. These trends are disclosed today - World Book Day - in Jenny Hartley's new book Reading Groups*, the first research into the communal habit. Ms Hartley, principal lecturer in English literature at Surrey University, studied more than 1,000 readers in a total of 350 reading groups. Their excited and engaged voices, she writes, \"sound as if they're living on a different planet from the current batch of literary and social commentators weighed down by millennial lamentations\". The lamentations are about a book culture allegedly drowned out by media culture, the internet and other pressures on leisure. Ms Hartley said her results show that \"reading groups read widely and well and the literary fiction they favour is in good heart and financial shape both in the US and the UK\". Historically, too, groups have had more social influence than commentators allow, she adds. In late 19th century America, women's reading groups provided the sinews of the women's suffrage movement.

Geographically, they are evenly spread, with slightly more in the countryside. \"We share a common culture, which we take for granted, but which comes under scrutiny every month,\" one reader told the survey. Another said: \"I love the buzz and the sharing of opinions and chat.\" In others, the old motive which stirred their parents and grandparents in Goole still lives: \"We love 'having to read', so don't feel guilty. It allows me a few legitimate hours to myself away from the kids\". *Oxford University Press, \u00a35.99 paperback Reading groups' favourites 1 Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Louis de Berni\u00e8res 2 Angela's Ashes, Frank McCourt 3 The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy 4 Enduring Love, Ian McEwan 5 Cold Mountain, Charles Frazier 6 Fugitive Pieces, Anne Michaels 7 Alias Grace, Margaret Atwood 8 Behind the Scenes at the Museum, Kate Atkinson 9 Memoirs of a Gheisha, Arthur Golden 10 Birdsong, Sebastian Faulks 11 Every man for himself, Beryl Bainbridge 12 Snow falling on Cedars, David Guterson 13 Larry's Party, Carol Shields 14 The Reader, Bernard Schlink 15 = Beloved, Toni Morrison; The Shipping News, E Annie Proulx 17 Ladder of Years, Anne Tyler 18 = Regeneration, Pat Barker; A Patchwork Planet, Anne Tyler 20 Quar-antine, Jim Crace 21 A Thousand Acres, Jane Smiley",

The film, by first-time director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre since it cleared the board at Critics' Week in Cannes. Fears were raised that it would never be shown here because of a 21-second scene in which a rottweiler and a pit bull terrier simulate a fight to the death in a Mexico City gambling den. British distributors were wary because of the strict provisions of the obscure Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937, which outlaws goading of animals for the camera, despite protests that it would be a national embarrassment if a film which has won more than 20 international prizes was not shown here. However, after prolonged examination of the film, and with pressure building from such distinguished directors as Stephen Frears to have the law changed, the British Board of Film Classification has ruled that the scene does not break the law. But the RSPCA said that it was \"extremely concerned and disappointed\" by the ruling, which it said \"could contribute to the glamorisation of a horrifically cruel underground activity we spend a large part of our resources trying to combat. Only this week four men have been jailed because of our investigations\". Chief inspector Mike Butcher, who has led special operations against dog fighters for 15 years, viewed the film, and although he conceded that the fight scene \"was not used for gratuitous shock value, it was just too realistic for my liking, which raises the question of whether there was cruelty involved\".

The new product, Pampers Bibsters, will make its debut in the US and is likely, if successful, to be rolled out worldwide. The Bibsters come in a box of 20 costing around \u00a32.70. The bib features an absorbent top - which is made to look and feel like cloth - and has a protective barrier layer underneath. Pictures of animals are printed on the bibs, which come in two sizes - small for babies aged 0-6 months and large for babies aged six months and older. P&amp;G has already launched Pamper Baby Wipes and Pampers Care Mats. It had to label the packaging of the disposable changing mats with a safety warning after there was some consumer confusion about how to use them.

      "bodyText": "The government is planning a crackdown on multinationals that defile public property with illegal flyposters. And Westminster Council is threatening to take legal action against sports giant Nike over an illegal flyposting campaign. The move signals a new crackdown on global corporations that are willing to break the law to get products as mundane as catfood and noodles noticed. Flyposting, once limited to independent record labels and music promoters, has expanded in recent years. Major blue-chip companies such as Mars and Unilever are now just as likely to get involved in the practice. Current campaigns plastered up on walls around London include those for Whiskas catfood and Batchelors Supernoodles. Both campaigns are designed to look as if they have come from small rebellious companies unable to afford billboard advertising. The department for the environment, transport and the regions recently introduced guidelines for councils that explain the kind of action they can take. These include how to recoup the cost of cleaning up from the advertisers themselves. A spokesman for the department said it was hoping to increase government powers in the area as soon as possible. \"We definitely want to toughen up on this,\" he said. No one at Batchelors was available for comment. A spokesperson for Mars, which owns Whiskas, said the company was not willing to comment on its involvement in illegal flyposting. However, a recent press release issued on behalf of Whiskas said the company was embarking on a \"guerilla\" marketing campaign that would include flyposting. Westminster Council has been particularly active in the effort to combat the practice. The council recently introduced a type of paint that makes it impossible for billboards to be posted on its property. It is planning to increase its budget for fighting the flyposters by \u00a3200,000 this year. \"We are beginning to consider the origins of the problem and look at how we can target the culprits,\" said a Westminster Council spokesman. \"Practices like this create an atmosphere that makes it easier for crime to breed.\" Flyposting is technically illegal but, until recently, many councils turned a blind eye, reasoning that no real harm was being done. But the huge increase in the number of multinationals using flyposters - along with the establishment of specialist agencies dedicated to the practice - has led to a crackdown in both local and national government.

      "body": "<p>It is Ash Wednesday and the name takes on a whole new meaning for the farmers as thousands more farm animals are condemned to be burned. Our view of the distant horizon has shrunk considerably in the past 10 days, and by teatime on Tuesday we couldn't see a thing. Every window in the farmhouse was covered in thick snow and even letting the dogs out for a wee was becoming almost impossible. Tigger the terrier disappeared a few times under the shifting drifts and pretended she simply didn't need to go, but as we had a suspicious puddle in the office on Monday afternoon we ignored her pleading looks.</p> <p>The situation by bedtime was so bad we didn't know whether to laugh or cry. And I almost did. Our immense worry over foot and mouth had been temporarily eclipsed by the age-old winter risk - a severe storm, which felt like a direct descendant of the infamous 1947 storm. The lights flickered on and off, but we were lucky and remained connected - some areas have been without power for more than 24 hours. But still our house remains cold - the Aga is unable to keep the kitchen warm, but it dries the outdoor gear over and over again.</p> <p>Peter put the water pump on nearly all day yesterday because on remote farms like ours, no power means no water. We have an 8,000-gallon holding tank, but with three sheds full of cattle and two houses it wouldn't last 48 hours.</p> <p>The priority after a bad storm is to find the sheep, feed and count them, and then check for foot and mouth. This is not easy as the sheep are bedraggled and their fleeces are caked with snowballs that make the fleece look dirty. So when the researcher from Irish radio rang and asked if we were constantly checking our sheep for symptoms I said: \"Yes, of course we are, but in truth we can't do it as thoroughly today because of the weather.\" I am sure she thought I was either joking or crazy.</p> <p>Sleep is becoming a yearned-for luxury. I was up again at 1.30am, because the house was groaning as if in an age-old protest against the fierce weather. Eventually I managed to nod off but we were up at 6am to find blue skies, deep drifts and the house bedecked by long icicles. Don't fairy tales and legends usually have a darker side?</p> <p>Peter dug his way out of the back door through three feet of snow and then dug his way into the cattle sheds to feed and check the cattle. So far, so good. After breakfast we went searching for the outlying sheep. We used tractors instead of the quad bike to get through the four-foot drifts. By lunchtime only two sheep out of our large flock were unaccounted for. The search to find them has since begun. I expect they were in shelter somewhere trying to keep warm and the snow blew in on top.</p> <p>The media coverage of the crisis is good, but at times I feel there is too much speculation and not enough hard facts, especially on television. There is a world of difference between a confirmed case and a suspected case of foot and mouth. I learned today that some of the blood tests can take up to 96 hours - which is why in some regions we wait so long for news.</p> <p>Still, the total of confirmed cases grimly rises - 24 as I write this - and I believe that a larger area of the UK is affected now than in the last serious outbreak. And yet the government spent time yesterday debating the contentious hunting issue. Nick Brown seems sincere, but why wasn't the debate scrapped, or at least postponed?</p> <p>When we are confident to go out and about again (if ever) and the countryside march is rescheduled, we'll all be there, whatever our opinion is over the hunting issue. Solidarity in the countryside is what counts. This epidemic will bind us together tighter than ever.</p> <p>The latest sector to suffer is rural tourism. I have spoken to several farmers' wives who run successful B&amp;B establishments and rent out holiday cottages in Northumberland. They have all cancelled their visitors. In many cases these operations earn more than the livestock business. They need information and guidance and they need it now.</p> <p>Peter has cleared our road with the JCB, but the main road is really bad. Around 60 farmers are usually employed by the county council to clear and grit roads, so it will take longer without them to get the county travelling again.</p> <p>No post today, but our heroic milkman somehow left us fresh pints and eggs at the road end, which was wonderful, because we were down to powdered milk.</p> <p>\u0095 The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

      "bodyText": "It is Ash Wednesday and the name takes on a whole new meaning for the farmers as thousands more farm animals are condemned to be burned. Our view of the distant horizon has shrunk considerably in the past 10 days, and by teatime on Tuesday we couldn't see a thing. Every window in the farmhouse was covered in thick snow and even letting the dogs out for a wee was becoming almost impossible. Tigger the terrier disappeared a few times under the shifting drifts and pretended she simply didn't need to go, but as we had a suspicious puddle in the office on Monday afternoon we ignored her pleading looks. The situation by bedtime was so bad we didn't know whether to laugh or cry. And I almost did. Our immense worry over foot and mouth had been temporarily eclipsed by the age-old winter risk - a severe storm, which felt like a direct descendant of the infamous 1947 storm. The lights flickered on and off, but we were lucky and remained connected - some areas have been without power for more than 24 hours. But still our house remains cold - the Aga is unable to keep the kitchen warm, but it dries the outdoor gear over and over again. Peter put the water pump on nearly all day yesterday because on remote farms like ours, no power means no water. We have an 8,000-gallon holding tank, but with three sheds full of cattle and two houses it wouldn't last 48 hours. The priority after a bad storm is to find the sheep, feed and count them, and then check for foot and mouth. This is not easy as the sheep are bedraggled and their fleeces are caked with snowballs that make the fleece look dirty. So when the researcher from Irish radio rang and asked if we were constantly checking our sheep for symptoms I said: \"Yes, of course we are, but in truth we can't do it as thoroughly today because of the weather.\" I am sure she thought I was either joking or crazy. Sleep is becoming a yearned-for luxury. I was up again at 1.30am, because the house was groaning as if in an age-old protest against the fierce weather. Eventually I managed to nod off but we were up at 6am to find blue skies, deep drifts and the house bedecked by long icicles. Don't fairy tales and legends usually have a darker side? Peter dug his way out of the back door through three feet of snow and then dug his way into the cattle sheds to feed and check the cattle. So far, so good. After breakfast we went searching for the outlying sheep. We used tractors instead of the quad bike to get through the four-foot drifts. By lunchtime only two sheep out of our large flock were unaccounted for. The search to find them has since begun. I expect they were in shelter somewhere trying to keep warm and the snow blew in on top. The media coverage of the crisis is good, but at times I feel there is too much speculation and not enough hard facts, especially on television. There is a world of difference between a confirmed case and a suspected case of foot and mouth. I learned today that some of the blood tests can take up to 96 hours - which is why in some regions we wait so long for news. Still, the total of confirmed cases grimly rises - 24 as I write this - and I believe that a larger area of the UK is affected now than in the last serious outbreak. And yet the government spent time yesterday debating the contentious hunting issue. Nick Brown seems sincere, but why wasn't the debate scrapped, or at least postponed? When we are confident to go out and about again (if ever) and the countryside march is rescheduled, we'll all be there, whatever our opinion is over the hunting issue. Solidarity in the countryside is what counts. This epidemic will bind us together tighter than ever. The latest sector to suffer is rural tourism. I have spoken to several farmers' wives who run successful B&amp;B establishments and rent out holiday cottages in Northumberland. They have all cancelled their visitors. In many cases these operations earn more than the livestock business. They need information and guidance and they need it now. Peter has cleared our road with the JCB, but the main road is really bad. Around 60 farmers are usually employed by the county council to clear and grit roads, so it will take longer without them to get the county travelling again. No post today, but our heroic milkman somehow left us fresh pints and eggs at the road end, which was wonderful, because we were down to powdered milk. \u0095 The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

His five flights propelled by the 800hp backpack developed by Nasa cost \u00a3170,000, and lasted only 30 seconds each. \"This type of innovation is one of the reasons for the longevity of samba. The whole point of the parade is to attract attention,\" said Jose Carlos Rego, an authority on the carnival. The procession was also notable for attracting a large number of topless paraders with silicone implants. One model, Angela Bismarchi, had several cosmetic operations - all performed by her 53-year-old plastic surgeon husband - to win a place on a prominent float. The festivities began less than a week after 19 prisoners died in jail riots in Brazil, adding resonance to the theme of peace chosen for many of the parades. But this did not stop sporadic outbreaks of violence. Several people died and many were wounded in street fights. An Australian-Chinese tourist was assaulted and killed on a bus near the Sambadrome, the purpose-built avenue-like stadium which is the centrepiece of the festivities. In Rio state, 238 people died violently during the festival. International celebrities and hundreds of thousands of tourists descended on Brazil for the week. Arnold Schwarzenegger was banned from the Sambadrome's VIP area because he refused to wear the sponsor's T-shirt.",

Pierrepoint's period in office ended in 1956. Harry Allen and Robert Leslie Stewart simultaneously dispatched the last two men hanged in Britain, at Strangeways and Walton, on August 13, 1964. \u0095 In our report of the Bafta awards, page 3, February 26, we said the best newcomer award went to Pawel Pawlikowski the director of Lost Weekend. The film is actually called Last Resort. \u0095 Herpreet Kaur Grewal, a former student at Brunel University, now studying newspaper journalism at the City University, has asked us to confirm that she is not the Herpreet Kaur referred to in an article, pages 10 and 11, Education, November 7, last year. Herpreet Kaur in that article was, in fact, a pseudonym chosen to conceal the identity of another student still at Brunel. We are sorry if the similarity of the names caused embarrassment, and regret that on this occasion the paper's policy of making it clear when names have been changed was not followed. \u0095 William Cobbett did say what we attributed to him, page 4, yesterday (a report headed: Global trade forces exodus from land), but not when we said he said it, in 1753. He was not born until 1763. In a panel, page 5, February 27, about precautionary measures brought about by the foot and mouth crisis, we said Magdalene College, Oxford, had closed to the public to protect the deer in its grounds. That is Magdalen College, Oxford, the one that has indeed taken the step. Magdalene College is in Cambridge. \u0095 In a map of the danger areas in the present outbreak of foot and mouth disease, page 29, yesterday, we placed Bangor national hunt racecourse at Bangor in Gwynedd, near one of the sites affected by the disease. The racecourse is not there. It is at Bangor-on-Dee, near Wrexham.

      "bodyText": "George Bush has put extra spending on the national missile defence (NMD) project at the centre of his budget, it emerged yesterday when the White House released further details of the Republican administration's plans. Mr Bush reiterated his strong commitment to NMD in his 50-minute keynote speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. The White House's detailed budget plan, published yesterday, confirms that the controversial missile shield is at the heart of its planning for the next decade. \"To protect our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must deploy effective missile defences,\" Mr Bush told Congress. \"And as we transform our military, we can discard cold war relics and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs.\" The budget plan allocates an extra $14bn (\u00a39.7bn) to defence spending, taking the Pentagon's budget for next year to $310bn, or about a third of the total world military spending. A key element is a $2.6bn allocation - part of a $20bn five-year programme - to fund research and development of new weapon technologies. Roughly half of this is earmarked for NMD, and for what yesterday's budget plan describes as \"new technologies to support the transformation of US military capabilities\". Pentagon officials say the money is intended to underscore the administration's intention of expanding NMD beyond the ground-based system under consideration by the Clinton administration. Other leading items in the Pentagon budget plan are an already promised extra $1.4bn for armed forces pay and a swingeing round of US military base closures at home and abroad, money-saving exercise certain to be controversial in Congress. Current Pentagon estimates indicate that as much as a quarter of its current base capacity may be closed. The total Pentagon budget for 2002 is much lower than many Republican politicians and members of the administration want. Washington observers believe the figures should be seen very much as a down payment on a potentially huge shake-up of Pentagon spending, including large amounts of new money, in later years of the administration. The full extent of Mr Bush's military spending plans, including NMD, will only become clear once his defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, has completed three parallel reviews of military priorities. The first and most important will re-examine national security strategy, the structure of the forces, and budget priorities, and is designed \"to create a vision of the nation's military in the 21st century\", according to yesterday's paper. The second focuses specifically on deterrence and missile programmes, including the US nuclear stockpile and NMD. The third will look at military pay and quality of life. Mr Bush began a two-day tour of five states yesterday to help promote the economic package at the centre of his address to Congress. The speech, which took the place of this year's State of the Union address, focused overwhelmingly on his budget plans. Political pride of place was given to the $1,600bn tax cut package, which Democrats have attacked as excessive. \"Some say my tax plan is too big. Others say it is too small. I respectfully disagree. This plan is just right,\" Mr Bush told Congress, delivering what is likely to be the most-quoted line of his address. The speech was by far the most important Mr Bush has given since becoming president, and showed the extent to which he is attempting to push America's centre of political gravity to the right after the Clinton years. He offered big tax cuts, partial privatisation of the federal pension scheme, private school vouchers, cuts in public expenditure, and a restructuring of health care for the elderly. None of these plans was on the table in Mr Clinton's time, nor would any of them have been if Al Gore had won last year's election. \"He talks to the middle while governing to the right,\" the conservative Wall Street Journal observed.",

If he was serious about saving legal aid money, then he would legalise cannabis.</p> <p>For the record, I had three years academic training and three years legal training before qualifying as a criminal lawyer (resulting in \u00a310,000 of debt). Current adverts show that a newly qualified police officer after 18 weeks of training earns more than I do. How much does Jack Straw earn for his constant attacks on civil liberties, such as the right to jury trials? <br><b> Matt Foot</b> Christian Fisher solicitors <a href=\"mailto:mattf@christianf.co.uk\">mattf@christianf.co.uk</a></p> <p>Is it too much to ask for ministers to provide an accurate and informed view of the least well-paid section of the profession, rather than seeking to undermine their efforts in pursuit of cheap political points? Mr Straw knows very well that most criminal defence lawyers, who in most cases undertake work at a salary reflecting the appalling rates authorised by his government, are dedicated honest professionals on call at all hours.</p> <p>Perhaps his comments would be more appropriately directed at the greedy practices of members of the corporate sector which his government seems so keen to sidle up to. I, for one, no longer intend to vote Labour at the forthcoming election. <br><b>Nick Brett</b> <br> London <a href=\"mailto:brett@saunders.co.uk\">brett@saunders.co.uk</a></p> <p>Jack Straw complains of the growing number of lawyers. When I was in the US in the 80s, I observed a similar trend. I concluded it had two causes: the need to secure compensation in the absence of an adequate welfare state; and the need to pay off student loans. Both now operate here. Since I first attended the Lords 13 years ago, the upper reaches of the legal profession are the only part of the British political establishment for which my respect has increased. They are better able to distinguish the public interest from their personal interest than any other part of the system. Those least able to do so are ministers of the crown of any political persuasion. <br><b>Conrad Russell</b> <br> House of Lords</p>",

For someone who worked in law centres for 10 years (indeed I was the first law centre worker), I resent his attack on all lawyers as being greedy, lacking community spirit and eager and willing to mix with criminals. His and the lord chancellor's drive towards crippling the legal aid scheme by severe financial cutbacks and general abuse have resulted in my early retirement because of the vast sums having to be spent on bureaucracy instead of case preparation, resulting in solicitors being forced to give a much poorer service to their clients. The home secretary has always been a bullshitter, as can be seen from his silly remarks about 24-hour courts, when most courts in London are half empty most of the time, and often there are more court staff and police than defendants. Labour has presided over a removal of defendants' rights and a substantial decrease in the number of people being arrested and brought before the courts - and has made a general mess of its legal policies - and the home secretary has the nerve to call me names. Peter Kandler London Jack Straw does not attack city lawyers, who earn considerably more than legal aid lawyers. If he was serious about saving legal aid money, then he would legalise cannabis. For the record, I had three years academic training and three years legal training before qualifying as a criminal lawyer (resulting in \u00a310,000 of debt). Current adverts show that a newly qualified police officer after 18 weeks of training earns more than I do. How much does Jack Straw earn for his constant attacks on civil liberties, such as the right to jury trials? Matt Foot Christian Fisher solicitors mattf@christianf.co.uk Is it too much to ask for ministers to provide an accurate and informed view of the least well-paid section of the profession, rather than seeking to undermine their efforts in pursuit of cheap political points? Mr Straw knows very well that most criminal defence lawyers, who in most cases undertake work at a salary reflecting the appalling rates authorised by his government, are dedicated honest professionals on call at all hours. Perhaps his comments would be more appropriately directed at the greedy practices of members of the corporate sector which his government seems so keen to sidle up to. I, for one, no longer intend to vote Labour at the forthcoming election. Nick Brett London brett@saunders.co.uk Jack Straw complains of the growing number of lawyers. When I was in the US in the 80s, I observed a similar trend. I concluded it had two causes: the need to secure compensation in the absence of an adequate welfare state; and the need to pay off student loans. Both now operate here. Since I first attended the Lords 13 years ago, the upper reaches of the legal profession are the only part of the British political establishment for which my respect has increased. They are better able to distinguish the public interest from their personal interest than any other part of the system. Those least able to do so are ministers of the crown of any political persuasion. Conrad Russell House of Lords",

      "bodyText": "Hardly surprising perhaps, but Christopher Hitchen's view is completely one-sided (A nation betrayed, February 26). In his critique of Henry Kissinger's Cyprus policy he says \"the total of falsity is so impressive\". Indeed it is. The US and the UK believe that the attempted genocide of Turkish Cypriots by Greek Cypriots in 1963-64, 1967 and 1974 never happened, despite being documented in the The Genocide Files and in contemporary reports. Former British prime minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, said: \"I was convinced that if Archbishop Makarios could not bring himself to treat the Turkish Cypriots as human beings, he was inviting the invasion and partition of the island.\" The US and the UK believe that the Turkish Cypriot MPs and officials walked out of their offices, when they were thrown out at gunpoint. They believe that the Greek Cypriot government is the government of Cyprus, a status to which it has no legal or moral right. Not until the US and UK address the falsehoods will there be any settlement. Hakki Muftuzade London office, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus",

On market day he does \"a rip roaring trade in pasties\". But the town has lost its bustle. People who are venturing out are terrified about what's happening, he said, recalling one woman in his shop who remembered the last foot and mouth outbreak. \"She says it took her 45 years to build up her dairy herd. You can't replace that. You can't go out and buy a new one.\"</p> <p>Of all the town's people, Denis Bater probably understands best the impact of foot and mouth.

This closure has had a tremendous impact. People from all the villages come here for shopping, a lot of retired people like to come on Tuesdays - it's their social day. Since foot and mouth, no one's coming. A lot of businesses here are small, run on a shoestring.

Poorer space fanatics are offered an aisle seat for $5,000; the poorest a free simulation of the destruction on the company's website.

      "body": "<p>Eidos, the computer games company that has seen its once high flying share price shattered by a string of profit warnings over the past year, yesterday signalled that it would continue to cut costs in anticipation of further tough trading conditions. </p> <p>Chief executive Mike McGarvey said the belt tightening was necessary due to delays to the distribution of the new PlayStation 2 console and the launch of Microsoft's Xbox machine, which made a big increase in games sales and a return to profitability unlikely until 2002 or even 2003. </p> <p>\"This company grew very fast and the mentality used to be one of spend, spend, spend rather than save, save, save, and it didn't perhaps have the focus on costs that it should have,\" Mr McGarvey said. </p> <p>\"There will be a drive to significantly reduce fixed costs over the coming year.\" </p> <p>Mr McGarvey's cost-cutting measures have already led to a 17% drop in fixed sales and marketing spend and an 11% reduction in research and development costs. However, the firm has still be able to increase its market share in Britain, Germany and France and third-quarter sales showed signs of improvement. </p> <p>Shares in the company behind the popular Tomb Raider franchise yesterday fell 15% to 229p as the dealers digested figures showing a pre-tax loss of \u00a368m and revenues of \u00a3127m during the nine months to December 31. </p> <p>The stock once traded at more than \u00a310. </p> <p>Some analysts said they were concerned about Eidos' long-term financing position given that it had used up more than half of its \u00a350m overdraft facility and had just \u00a37.7m cash in the bank. </p> <p>The lack of a full-time finance director was also seen as a negative, but the company hopes to fill the post shortly. </p> <p>House broker Dresdner Klienwort Wasserstein was thought to be revising downwards its financial forecasts. </p> <p>However, other analysts said that fees owing by retailers from Christmas games sales would make the balance sheet seem more healthy once they were received. </p> <p>They also pointed to an investment in a Scandinavian technology firm named Opticom, which was worth around \u00a315m and could easily be sold. \"Eidos has a history of over-promising and under-delivering, but now it looks like they plan to under-promise and over-deliver, and we'd much rather have it that way,\" said one analyst. </p> <p>Last year Eidos received a takeover approach from Infogrames, a French rival keen to take advantage of the weakness in the British company's share price. </p> <p>Several analysts believe Eidos may eventually be swallowed up by a bigger group. </p> <p>\"I don't see great numbers of people frothing at the mouth to buy us, and some of the firms who might want to have their plates full integrating other acquisitions,\" said Mr McGarvey. \"But if someone approached us we'd obviously need to look at it on behalf of our shareholders. There will probably be a lot more interest in the later part of this year or maybe next year.\" </p> <p>Computer games sales tend to peak when new consoles go on sale and players upgrade to faster and more powerful models, but slow in the months before they are introduced. </p> <p>Eidos believes that this cycle is nearing its low point, and that the industry is about to enter its biggest boom period to date as gamers play on multiple platforms - including mobile phones, interactive televisions and PCs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eidos, the computer games company that has seen its once high flying share price shattered by a string of profit warnings over the past year, yesterday signalled that it would continue to cut costs in anticipation of further tough trading conditions. Chief executive Mike McGarvey said the belt tightening was necessary due to delays to the distribution of the new PlayStation 2 console and the launch of Microsoft's Xbox machine, which made a big increase in games sales and a return to profitability unlikely until 2002 or even 2003. \"This company grew very fast and the mentality used to be one of spend, spend, spend rather than save, save, save, and it didn't perhaps have the focus on costs that it should have,\" Mr McGarvey said. \"There will be a drive to significantly reduce fixed costs over the coming year.\" Mr McGarvey's cost-cutting measures have already led to a 17% drop in fixed sales and marketing spend and an 11% reduction in research and development costs. However, the firm has still be able to increase its market share in Britain, Germany and France and third-quarter sales showed signs of improvement. Shares in the company behind the popular Tomb Raider franchise yesterday fell 15% to 229p as the dealers digested figures showing a pre-tax loss of \u00a368m and revenues of \u00a3127m during the nine months to December 31. The stock once traded at more than \u00a310. Some analysts said they were concerned about Eidos' long-term financing position given that it had used up more than half of its \u00a350m overdraft facility and had just \u00a37.7m cash in the bank. The lack of a full-time finance director was also seen as a negative, but the company hopes to fill the post shortly. House broker Dresdner Klienwort Wasserstein was thought to be revising downwards its financial forecasts. However, other analysts said that fees owing by retailers from Christmas games sales would make the balance sheet seem more healthy once they were received. They also pointed to an investment in a Scandinavian technology firm named Opticom, which was worth around \u00a315m and could easily be sold. \"Eidos has a history of over-promising and under-delivering, but now it looks like they plan to under-promise and over-deliver, and we'd much rather have it that way,\" said one analyst. Last year Eidos received a takeover approach from Infogrames, a French rival keen to take advantage of the weakness in the British company's share price. Several analysts believe Eidos may eventually be swallowed up by a bigger group. \"I don't see great numbers of people frothing at the mouth to buy us, and some of the firms who might want to have their plates full integrating other acquisitions,\" said Mr McGarvey. \"But if someone approached us we'd obviously need to look at it on behalf of our shareholders. There will probably be a lot more interest in the later part of this year or maybe next year.\" Computer games sales tend to peak when new consoles go on sale and players upgrade to faster and more powerful models, but slow in the months before they are introduced. Eidos believes that this cycle is nearing its low point, and that the industry is about to enter its biggest boom period to date as gamers play on multiple platforms - including mobile phones, interactive televisions and PCs.",

Now, no one even mourns the passing of The Magic Rabbits, let alone chats about them nostalgically in the pub as they maybe would about Bagpuss or Chorlton And The Wheelies. </p> <p>Of course, that was in the days before they even had proper music in Brookside. At that time, whenever anyone turned on a radio, what piped out wasn't the same kind of music that was played in Kaff's Caff in Walford or on the jukebox in the Rovers (which is to say, music we all recognise that had to be paid for before it could be broadcast). Oh no - it was music that sounded as if it was recorded round Liverpool's Further Education colleges by aspiring indie bands. Which it probably was. </p> <p>Nowadays though, the makers of Brookside have forked out for proper music, and you can't move in Bev's Bar for a bit of Britney. The Manor Park Massive's trip to Southport was no different. They had a right good sing-along to The Troggs' Wild Thing, which seemed all too appropriate, what with Lance and Leanne (troglodytes of the lowest order) cosied up with Dr Darren the (im)patient fiddler, Bernie Nolan and Rachel Jordache-Dixon (who, if her current run of bad luck is anything to go by, will shortly be marrying Max Farnham). </p> <p>I admit that Brookside can be a bit fanciful on occasion, but this homage to Una Stubbs and Cliff Richard seemed a bit much. Certainly, Dr Darren should get full marks for bravery for staring Leanne in the face (he's a braver man than me), but would he and Posh Victoria really share a minibus with the woman who not only accused him of assaulting her but also served time for throwing acid in the face of their mate, Jacqui Dixon? Doesn't the same go for Rachel, who seems far too keen on Bev who tried to ruin her and Mike's life not long ago? And surely Bernie Nolan would have suggested one of her own back catalogue for a sing-along instead of The Troggs? </p> <p>The only explanation for all this must be that proffered by Madonna. Music really does make the people come together. </p> <p>But all the Southport shenanigans faded into the background with the traumatastic goings-on in the Dixon household. No, not the hostage situation, which perhaps induced a heart attack in Ron (we live in hope). Rather, the big news of the night was the revelation - voiced by Kitty the California Raisin - that Jessie has got, and I quote, \"a pokey hole\". Can't say I'm surprised but that is way too much information. </p> <p>Like Police Dog Academy without the dogs, <strong> Raw Blues</strong> (BBC1) follows new recruits to the Metropolitan Police through their four-month training course. A cursed docusoap that verged dangerously on recruitment video, it began with a speech about how there was no room for sexism, racism, homophobia or bullying in the Met. This is not, as you might expect, because it is already jam-packed full of those things and there simply isn't room for any more but because the Met wants to change its bad old, sad old ways. </p> <p>With 180 recruits needed every five weeks, the trainers at Hendon were trying to come over all touchy-feely with the 93 in this intake. Hence, there was much talk of police officers having enormous responsibility and being examples of good citizens, of how much the police had changed and were adapting to a modern world - effectively, of how the police were nice really. </p> <p>And then Sergeant Dave appeared. He described himself as a disciplinarian but a teddy bear - Paddington in jackboots, I suppose - and proceeded to give his recruits a hard time for being a couple of minutes late and early alarm calls for not shaving that morning. Either you are clean-shaven or have a full beard, he explained to Craig, who was growing a goatee. (Apparently, if you are the one running towards a detonated bomb while everyone else is running away, or helping an old lady who's been mugged, having a goatee is a real handicap.)

Sports When We Were Kings 9pm, BBC Knowledge There's plenty of live sport around today, with golf and tennis dominating Eurosport's schedules, but the real action comes in this documentary about the world heavyweight title fight between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali in October 1974, better known as \"The Rumble in the Jungle\". An Oscar-winner in 1997, it has been shown before (its introduction, on the BBC, comes from Des Lynam) but if you missed it, don't do so again.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The British surrealists used to meet at the Three Horseshoes pub, recalls Conroy Maddox, next to the Dominion Theatre in London's Tottenham Court Road, every Wednesday at 6pm, through the late 1930s and into the second world war. A more refined cultural outfit, Poetry London, also met at the same time, at the same place. Insults flew threw the air: \"We always hated each other.\" Rowdier still were the monthly dinners at the Barcelona restaurant: at the end of every meal, complete chaos broke out. The surrealists were thrown out every time, but always allowed back because they brought along celebrities such as Dylan Thomas. </p> <p>Conroy Maddox is dapper and a bit elfin, with a dark moustache that belies his 88 years. The world's oldest practising surrealist painter has never retired - how can a surrealist retire? He still dreams, and paints. He takes me into his studio, full of canvases from different periods in his career, ready to be taken to the gallery for his latest exhibition. The canvas he's finishing on the easel looks just like the ones he was painting in the first half of the 20th century: empty colonnades, figures isolated in vast landscapes, living statues - a lexicon of surrealism. </p> <p>Relics of the surrealist movement fill his two-storey flat, from Christ on the cross in a bottle - one of his - to works by Max Ernst and the Belgian poet, musician and artist ELT Mesens. It's a sublime Freudian chaos. Every picture tells a story: he explains that one of his paintings, entitled Passionate Attitudes at Saltp tri\u00e8re, propped up on the landing, refers to the experimental treatment of hysterics by the late 19th century psychiatrist Charcot. The surrealists, he explains, got their hands on the records of Charcot's dealings with his patients - \"he'd slept with them\" - and explained hysteria not as an illness but as a poetic condition. </p> <p>Outside, it's rainy north London in 2001. In here it's Paris 60, 70, 80 years ago. Dreams suspend time. The famous arcades of Paris which inspired Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project and Louis Aragon's rambling reverie Paris Peasant had disappeared almost entirely by the time Conroy Maddox first visited Paris in 1937. But in 1940, he depicted them in his most famous work, Passage de l'Op\u00e9ra, a classic of surrealist painting owned by the Tate, which takes its title from one of the most celebrated Paris arcades. </p> <p>It takes a long view down the arcade, which recedes in an uncanny geometrical perspective under its transparent roof. Although there is a bright blue sky, the neatly-suited figures walking through it are somnambulant. An archway to the right is a gaping tomb-like recess, and in the foreground a white stone lion clutches a blanket. </p> <p>You can't explain an image like this, he says, and you shouldn't. \"A surrealist does not know what he is doing. Dali didn't know what he was doing. I don't know what I'm doing. Something happens and it develops, but you don't analyse it. By doing that you destroy a surrealist image.\" </p> <p>There's a bit of free association: He points to one of his recent collages hanging in the lounge. \"For example, you see a picture of a pair of scissors and cut it out and immediately it becomes a pair of eyes. There was a philosophy behind it, you see. Surrealism is a kind of exploration and discovery; it draws on dreams and obsessions and fears and all these things. What do you prefer, the night or the day?\" </p> <p>His painting is partly a vision of Paris as the surrealist city, capital of the unconscious. When Maddox went there in the 1930s, it was a city of freedoms beyond anything you were likely to encounter in dowdy Britain. He remembers getting off the train and trying to walk to the premises of the publisher he'd agreed to meet, and on the way getting into a sword fight with rolled-up umbrellas. </p> <p>His opponent turned out to be Isadora Duncan's brother who took him to a toga party. He finally got to the publishers where he bumped into the German surrealist Hans Bellmer, \"who was really quite odd\". Bellmer was there to pick up his book, La Poup\u00e9e, still today deeply disturbing in its sexual violence. </p> <p>To understand why Paris meant so much to Conroy Maddox, you have to begin in Birmingham. Britain in the 1930s was, after Hitler's Germany, the least sympathetic country in the world to modern art. The director of the Tate Gallery despised Picasso, and Peggy Guggenheim was thwarted in her attempts to create a gallery of modern art here. Yet surrealism did put down roots in Britain. Talking to Maddox you begin to see why. Growing up in Birmingham, Maddox read about surrealism in the city library and connected it to British life. Indeed, the person who made him a surrealist was Queen Victoria. </p> <p>\"At the same time that I was reading about surrealism in the Birmingham library, I came across a book of the letters of Queen Victoria. She's writing to a woman friend, talking about things generally, and she suddenly writes, 'I'm wondering what to give dear Willy,' who of course was the Kaiser, and she's wondering what to give him for his birthday. To the same person she writes, a few pages on, 'I had a marvellous idea, I'm going to give dear Willy Mount Kilimanjaro. Isn't it a marvellous gesture?' That triggered off an idea - you thought of the Kaiser, who had one arm shorter than the other, and Queen Victoria on a horse, and I did my first surrealist painting on that subject.\" </p> <p>He wasn't alone in seeing a natural fit between surrealism, which sought to expose the irrational underpinnings of modern life, and Britain's flamboyant peculiarities. While Maddox and his friends Robert and John Melville set up a surrealist group in Birmingham, the movement was creating a sensation in London. Surrealism was chic in the 1930s, from Cecil Beaton's photography for Vogue to the surrealist home of Dali's patron Edward James, with its lip sofas and lobster telephones, to the leading artists who came out as surrealists - Eileen Agar, Roland Penrose, Paul Nash and Henry Moore. </p> <p>The leading critic of the day, Herbert Read, argued that surrealism was a natural aesthetic for the British because it was essentially a form of romanticism. In 1936, Read's vision of British surrealism bore fruit in a major international event in London attended by all the European leaders of the movement. Conroy Maddox did not participate. He's still angry about Read's interpretation. \"He saw it as romantic, like Wordsworth, but although it is romantic, it's romantic in a different way: it's revolutionary.\" </p> <p>Maddox did not appear in the International Surrealist Exhibition, but he went along to argue. The artist who most supported him was the movement's great and despised dissident: Dali. Maddox met him on the occasion of one of his most notorious stunts, on July 1 1936, when Dali delivered a lecture entitled Authentic Paranoiac Fantasies, wearing a deep-sea diving suit. In all the excitement, someone lost the spanner to unbolt his helmet. </p> <p>\"He nearly died. They screwed the headpiece up and it was very hot in those suits. And they couldn't find the spanner. He was twisted up with a couple of Russian wolfhounds on a lead, and they got twisted around his leg, so he clomped along - and of course the audience thought it was marvellous. He was sitting there trying to recover and Mesens introduced me to him.\" He panted his support for Maddox's disruptive attitude to official British surrealism. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, Maddox did join the movement and was part of one of the few flowerings of the avant-garde in 20th-century Britain. British surrealist art has wit and charm. Roland Penrose, not only a terrific artist but a major collector of modern art and the biographer of Picasso, Eileen Agar and Maddox himself, created images at once international and British, radical and popular. Surrealism also shaped the most exciting British films and writing of the 1930s and 1940s - most beautifully, Michael Powell's intensely-coloured, dream-like film A Matter of Life and Death. </p> <p>And here, in Conroy Maddox's house, it continues. He shows me a bottle of Pagan Society wine that commemorates a lecture he gave there recently. Religion is one of his targets; in the 1940s he was photographed pretending to stab a nun, and a recent collage, Music Is Dangerous, puts together stories he clipped from newspapers featuring mishaps that have befallen musicians. The strangest tells how a cellist climbed over a wall into a convent and was beaten to death by the nuns. In a world where such things happen, surrealism will never die. </p> <p>\u0095 Conroy Maddox: A Surrealist Odyssey is at the Belgrave Gallery, Englands Lane, London NW3 (020-7722 5150), from March 15 to April 5. Maddox's work is also on show in Surrealism in Birmingham: 1935-1954 at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (0121-303 2834) until March 11.</p>",

By doing that you destroy a surrealist image.\" There's a bit of free association: He points to one of his recent collages hanging in the lounge. \"For example, you see a picture of a pair of scissors and cut it out and immediately it becomes a pair of eyes. There was a philosophy behind it, you see. Surrealism is a kind of exploration and discovery; it draws on dreams and obsessions and fears and all these things. What do you prefer, the night or the day?\" His painting is partly a vision of Paris as the surrealist city, capital of the unconscious. When Maddox went there in the 1930s, it was a city of freedoms beyond anything you were likely to encounter in dowdy Britain. He remembers getting off the train and trying to walk to the premises of the publisher he'd agreed to meet, and on the way getting into a sword fight with rolled-up umbrellas. His opponent turned out to be Isadora Duncan's brother who took him to a toga party. He finally got to the publishers where he bumped into the German surrealist Hans Bellmer, \"who was really quite odd\". Bellmer was there to pick up his book, La Poup\u00e9e, still today deeply disturbing in its sexual violence. To understand why Paris meant so much to Conroy Maddox, you have to begin in Birmingham. Britain in the 1930s was, after Hitler's Germany, the least sympathetic country in the world to modern art. The director of the Tate Gallery despised Picasso, and Peggy Guggenheim was thwarted in her attempts to create a gallery of modern art here. Yet surrealism did put down roots in Britain. Talking to Maddox you begin to see why. Growing up in Birmingham, Maddox read about surrealism in the city library and connected it to British life. Indeed, the person who made him a surrealist was Queen Victoria. \"At the same time that I was reading about surrealism in the Birmingham library, I came across a book of the letters of Queen Victoria. She's writing to a woman friend, talking about things generally, and she suddenly writes, 'I'm wondering what to give dear Willy,' who of course was the Kaiser, and she's wondering what to give him for his birthday. To the same person she writes, a few pages on, 'I had a marvellous idea, I'm going to give dear Willy Mount Kilimanjaro. Isn't it a marvellous gesture?' That triggered off an idea - you thought of the Kaiser, who had one arm shorter than the other, and Queen Victoria on a horse, and I did my first surrealist painting on that subject.\" He wasn't alone in seeing a natural fit between surrealism, which sought to expose the irrational underpinnings of modern life, and Britain's flamboyant peculiarities. While Maddox and his friends Robert and John Melville set up a surrealist group in Birmingham, the movement was creating a sensation in London. Surrealism was chic in the 1930s, from Cecil Beaton's photography for Vogue to the surrealist home of Dali's patron Edward James, with its lip sofas and lobster telephones, to the leading artists who came out as surrealists - Eileen Agar, Roland Penrose, Paul Nash and Henry Moore. The leading critic of the day, Herbert Read, argued that surrealism was a natural aesthetic for the British because it was essentially a form of romanticism. In 1936, Read's vision of British surrealism bore fruit in a major international event in London attended by all the European leaders of the movement. Conroy Maddox did not participate. He's still angry about Read's interpretation. \"He saw it as romantic, like Wordsworth, but although it is romantic, it's romantic in a different way: it's revolutionary.\" Maddox did not appear in the International Surrealist Exhibition, but he went along to argue. The artist who most supported him was the movement's great and despised dissident: Dali. Maddox met him on the occasion of one of his most notorious stunts, on July 1 1936, when Dali delivered a lecture entitled Authentic Paranoiac Fantasies, wearing a deep-sea diving suit. In all the excitement, someone lost the spanner to unbolt his helmet. \"He nearly died. They screwed the headpiece up and it was very hot in those suits. And they couldn't find the spanner. He was twisted up with a couple of Russian wolfhounds on a lead, and they got twisted around his leg, so he clomped along - and of course the audience thought it was marvellous. He was sitting there trying to recover and Mesens introduced me to him.\" He panted his support for Maddox's disruptive attitude to official British surrealism. Soon afterwards, Maddox did join the movement and was part of one of the few flowerings of the avant-garde in 20th-century Britain. British surrealist art has wit and charm. Roland Penrose, not only a terrific artist but a major collector of modern art and the biographer of Picasso, Eileen Agar and Maddox himself, created images at once international and British, radical and popular. Surrealism also shaped the most exciting British films and writing of the 1930s and 1940s - most beautifully, Michael Powell's intensely-coloured, dream-like film A Matter of Life and Death. And here, in Conroy Maddox's house, it continues. He shows me a bottle of Pagan Society wine that commemorates a lecture he gave there recently. Religion is one of his targets; in the 1940s he was photographed pretending to stab a nun, and a recent collage, Music Is Dangerous, puts together stories he clipped from newspapers featuring mishaps that have befallen musicians. The strangest tells how a cellist climbed over a wall into a convent and was beaten to death by the nuns. In a world where such things happen, surrealism will never die. \u0095 Conroy Maddox: A Surrealist Odyssey is at the Belgrave Gallery, Englands Lane, London NW3 (020-7722 5150), from March 15 to April 5. Maddox's work is also on show in Surrealism in Birmingham: 1935-1954 at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (0121-303 2834) until March 11.",

      "body": "<p>I am in Prague, trying to solve a mystery. Unlike many of the visitors who weave their way through these streets, I am not here to marvel at the city's architecture, nor am I following the Kafka trail. Instead, I am in search of music, trying to understand why Czech music gets under the skin of so many people, including mine. It hits you with a force that can only be described as instinctual - and once it grabs you, you're hooked, and unable to shake off its influence. </p> <p>Prague itself supplies some of the answers to this conundrum. It is a place through which music sweeps inescapably. The city seems incapable of functioning without melody. Its clock towers mark the passing of time with tunes, not chimes. Record shops pipe operatic arias into the street. At night the squares reverberate to the sound of jazz from myriad clubs and cafes. </p> <p>Standing on the banks of the river Vltava, you can't help but hear Smetana's orchestral depiction from Ma Vlast in your head, and be struck by the fact that his music uncannily progresses at the exact speed of the river's flow. In the souvenir shops, along with the usual tat, CDs are for sale as images of national pride. For a few crowns, you can pick up the major works of the composers who put Czech music on the map and made it great - Smetana, Dvorak, Suk, Janacek and Martinu. </p> <p>This month, London's Barbican opens its Bohemian Spring season, a massive celebration that explores works, familiar and un familiar, by all five composers. The principal participants are the London Symphony Orchestra and the National Youth Orchestra. Conducting duties, meanwhile, are shared between Colin Davis and Jiri Belohlavek - a familiar figure to British audiences thanks to his work with the BBC Symphony and at Glyndebourne, where last year he conducted a revival of Janacek's Jenufa, considered by many to be definitive. </p> <p>It is Belohlavek whom I have come here to meet, at the rehearsal rooms of the Prague Philharmonia, the chamber ensemble he founded in 1993. The orchestra is housed in a Baroque building behind the National Theatre, where Belohlavek is also music director. </p> <p>Arriving early, I crash through the Philharmonia's front door, nearly colliding with a young oboist practising in the hallway. The oboist ushers me into an elaborately decorated Jugendstil room, where I sit surrounded by musicians marking up scores, packing and unpacking instruments, snatching cups of coffee. Occasionally doors open to reveal glittering salons beyond. </p> <p>A rehearsal of Jean Fran\u00e7aix's Divertissement is in progress somewhere, its pungent, French harmonies flooding the building. Belohlavek presides over this rigorous yet enthusiastic world like a benevolent deity. He talks about Czech music, in a lilting mixture of English and German, with warm-hearted eloquence. </p> <p>Why, I ask, is its impact so visceral? \"It's difficult to put into words,\" he says. \"It's music that's frank, open. Bohemian music is always very natural. You feel it at the bottom of your belly.\" He clutches his stomach and laughs. \"The composers are giving themselves from their full hearts. You can't always analyse it. It's not just the composer's skill. The spirit, rhythm and melody is strongly connected to the simple song of the people.\" </p> <p>The Czechs have always sung, even when they have been, almost literally, robbed of speech. Czech music came into being as a revolt against the suppression of language. The Austro-Hungarian Empire imposed German on its subjects. Czech was unofficial and proscribed. \"Music was one of the very few areas where the Czech element could express itself freely,\" says Belohlavek. \"The whole population was always making music for its daily use.\" </p> <p>After the abortive revolutions of 1848, Hapsburg rule slowly crumbled and the linguistic strictures were gradually lifted. Perhaps the most astonishing fact in the history of Czech music is that Smetana, its effective founder, was a German speaker and had to learn the language from scratch in order to write his operas when the government finally permitted a Czech theatre in Prague in 1861. It became the National Theatre in 1881, and opened with a performance of Smetana's Libuse, a great opera which, like too much of his output, is shamefully neglected outside the Czech Republic. </p> <p>Unlike German musical nationalism, which was founded on the idea of the unification of disparate political states, Czech music has always been about freedom of speech and autonomous expression. Janacek's music explosively enacts the conflict between oppression and liberty in acutely personal, psychological terms through his operatic experiments with naturalistic speech patterns. </p> <p>His reversion to medieval language in the Glagolitic Mass can be seen as an extension of the same political development. The ricocheting, brass-rich ebullience of his Sinfonietta was a direct response to the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1919. Freedom proved brief. In 1938, the Nazis arrived and Czech music once again demanded autonomy as the exiled Bohuslav Martinu produced his searing Concerto for Double String Orchestra in violent protest at the invasion. </p> <p>For many, however, it is Dvorak who is synonymous with Czech music. He made the world sit up and listen. In the late 19th century his work was deemed the embodiment of a \"national\" (as opposed to a \"nationalistic\") style, whence his famous invitation to the US, made in the hope that he would provide American music with a suitable model. Belohlavek is conducting Dvorak's Stabat Mater as the opening work of the Barbican season, the programme for which includes a number of spritual or religious works, including the British premiere of Petr Eben's Prague Te Deum, written after the velvet revolution of 1989. </p> <p>Under the communist regime, religious music was associated with freedom of speech. \"It was always a fight to get permission to perform a religious piece,\" says Belohlavek, \"and you had to be sure that there would be a good balance with other types of music. On the other hand, we never came to the situation where we couldn't perform the Stabat Mater. Every couple of years, you could put one of the main religious works on. They were always packed. People were waiting for them.\" </p> <p>Belohlavek knows all about the difficult relationship between Czech music and politics. The son of a lawyer, he was born in 1946 and trained at the Prague Conservatoire. \"I was lucky that in the time of the Prague Spring in 1968, Sergiu Celibidache was working here, and he put on some masterclasses for conducting students,\" he says. Celibidache, considered by some to be one of the greatest 20th-century conductors, was based in Sweden at the time. \"He invited me to visit him in Stockholm. That was my great chance. I lived in Sweden for two years to assist him and to study.\" </p> <p>After that came years of apprenticeship with the Czech Philharmonic, of which Belohlavek eventually became principal conductor from 1990 to 1992. He founded the Prague Philharmonia the following year in bizarre circumstances. Whereas in Britain we have military bands, the Czech Ministry of Defence had an entire orchestra at its disposal - namely the Prague Symphony. Its playing was, as Belohlavek put it, \"dubious\", and he was asked to establish a new ensemble to replace it. \"I said no - I'd been in the army for two years.\" </p> <p>But when the ministry pointed out that they had the funding to train 40 young musicians, Belohlavek changed his mind - on condition that he be allowed to form a chamber orchestra. \"People came from all over the country to audition. We had the cream of young musicians. We started work. Then there was a change in the Ministry of Defence. They cancelled everything. We were on the streets.\" Mercifully, another change in the law allowed him to continue to run the orchestra as a non-profit-making organisation, and he has turned it into a force to be reckoned with. </p> <p>When I leave him, I go round the corner to the National Theatre for a performance of Smetana's The Bartered Bride. As the overture begins, there is that familiar lurch \"at the bottom of my belly\", as Belohlavek would describe it, that I always get when I hear the piece. For many, this is the work with which the history of Czech music begins and that exemplifies its volatile exuberance, the immediacy of its impact and, above all, the heady sense of liberty that informs it. Is it any wonder that the word \"Bohemian\" is synonymous with freedom? </p> <p><strong>The Czech list: Five essential Bohemian works</strong></p> <p><strong> Smetana: Ma Vlast</strong> </p> <p>Ma Vlast (My Country) is a cycle of six thematically interrelated tone poems that depict the Bohemian landscape and explore Czech legend and mythology. The whole ranks among the most staggering achievements in the symphonic repertoire, though complete performances in the UK are still rare. (Barbican, March 29) </p> <p><strong> Dvorak: Stabat Mater</strong> </p> <p>A fervent Catholic, Dvorak began his Stabat Mater after the death of his daughter. Though written on a massive scale, this is a poignant, intimate work that strives for spiritual solace rather than the expression of intense grief. The Barbican's line-up of soloists is drawn from the outstanding ensemble of Prague's National Theatre. (Sunday) </p> <p><strong> Janacek: The Fiddler's Child</strong> </p> <p>A hymn to the transforming power of music, this depicts an impoverished boy, haunted by the ghost of his dead musician father, whose playing releases him from the anguish of earthly existence. It explores the elation and sorrow of the human condition in music of intense compassion and vividness. (March 7 and 8) </p> <p><strong> Martinu: Concerto for Double String Orchestra</strong> </p> <p>Written as the Nazis marched into the Sudetenland in 1938, the Concerto for Double String Orchestra is perhaps the most intensely political of Martinu's works, as well as his most thrilling. It is a passionate, virtuoso duel for two string orchestras locked in seemingly irreconcilable conflict. (March 21) </p> <p><strong> Suk: Asrael</strong> </p> <p>The least overtly political of Czech composers, Suk is temperamentally and stylistically close to Mahler. Taking its title from the Islamic conveyor of souls to the afterlife, Asrael was written after the deaths of Suk's wife Otilie and his father-in-law, Dvorak. It's strong stuff - essential listening, if your nerves can take it. (April 10) </p> <p>\u0095 Bohemian Spring is at the Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 8891) from Sunday until April 22.</p>",

In the late 19th century his work was deemed the embodiment of a \"national\" (as opposed to a \"nationalistic\") style, whence his famous invitation to the US, made in the hope that he would provide American music with a suitable model. Belohlavek is conducting Dvorak's Stabat Mater as the opening work of the Barbican season, the programme for which includes a number of spritual or religious works, including the British premiere of Petr Eben's Prague Te Deum, written after the velvet revolution of 1989. Under the communist regime, religious music was associated with freedom of speech. \"It was always a fight to get permission to perform a religious piece,\" says Belohlavek, \"and you had to be sure that there would be a good balance with other types of music. On the other hand, we never came to the situation where we couldn't perform the Stabat Mater. Every couple of years, you could put one of the main religious works on. They were always packed. People were waiting for them.\" Belohlavek knows all about the difficult relationship between Czech music and politics. The son of a lawyer, he was born in 1946 and trained at the Prague Conservatoire. \"I was lucky that in the time of the Prague Spring in 1968, Sergiu Celibidache was working here, and he put on some masterclasses for conducting students,\" he says. Celibidache, considered by some to be one of the greatest 20th-century conductors, was based in Sweden at the time. \"He invited me to visit him in Stockholm. That was my great chance. I lived in Sweden for two years to assist him and to study.\" After that came years of apprenticeship with the Czech Philharmonic, of which Belohlavek eventually became principal conductor from 1990 to 1992. He founded the Prague Philharmonia the following year in bizarre circumstances. Whereas in Britain we have military bands, the Czech Ministry of Defence had an entire orchestra at its disposal - namely the Prague Symphony. Its playing was, as Belohlavek put it, \"dubious\", and he was asked to establish a new ensemble to replace it. \"I said no - I'd been in the army for two years.\" But when the ministry pointed out that they had the funding to train 40 young musicians, Belohlavek changed his mind - on condition that he be allowed to form a chamber orchestra. \"People came from all over the country to audition. We had the cream of young musicians. We started work. Then there was a change in the Ministry of Defence. They cancelled everything. We were on the streets.\" Mercifully, another change in the law allowed him to continue to run the orchestra as a non-profit-making organisation, and he has turned it into a force to be reckoned with. When I leave him, I go round the corner to the National Theatre for a performance of Smetana's The Bartered Bride. As the overture begins, there is that familiar lurch \"at the bottom of my belly\", as Belohlavek would describe it, that I always get when I hear the piece. For many, this is the work with which the history of Czech music begins and that exemplifies its volatile exuberance, the immediacy of its impact and, above all, the heady sense of liberty that informs it. Is it any wonder that the word \"Bohemian\" is synonymous with freedom? The Czech list: Five essential Bohemian works Smetana: Ma Vlast Ma Vlast (My Country) is a cycle of six thematically interrelated tone poems that depict the Bohemian landscape and explore Czech legend and mythology. The whole ranks among the most staggering achievements in the symphonic repertoire, though complete performances in the UK are still rare. (Barbican, March 29) Dvorak: Stabat Mater A fervent Catholic, Dvorak began his Stabat Mater after the death of his daughter. Though written on a massive scale, this is a poignant, intimate work that strives for spiritual solace rather than the expression of intense grief. The Barbican's line-up of soloists is drawn from the outstanding ensemble of Prague's National Theatre. (Sunday) Janacek: The Fiddler's Child A hymn to the transforming power of music, this depicts an impoverished boy, haunted by the ghost of his dead musician father, whose playing releases him from the anguish of earthly existence. It explores the elation and sorrow of the human condition in music of intense compassion and vividness. (March 7 and 8) Martinu: Concerto for Double String Orchestra Written as the Nazis marched into the Sudetenland in 1938, the Concerto for Double String Orchestra is perhaps the most intensely political of Martinu's works, as well as his most thrilling. It is a passionate, virtuoso duel for two string orchestras locked in seemingly irreconcilable conflict. (March 21) Suk: Asrael The least overtly political of Czech composers, Suk is temperamentally and stylistically close to Mahler. Taking its title from the Islamic conveyor of souls to the afterlife, Asrael was written after the deaths of Suk's wife Otilie and his father-in-law, Dvorak. It's strong stuff - essential listening, if your nerves can take it. (April 10) \u0095 Bohemian Spring is at the Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 8891) from Sunday until April 22.",

One in every six will be living in India where the current population of just over 1bn is projected to rise by 600m.</p> <p>By contrast, population levels in Europe and Japan are projected to decline sharply because fertility is falling below the \"replacement level\" - that is to say, below an average of 2.1 children a woman.</p> <p>By mid-century the populations of Germany and Japan will have fallen on current trends by 14%, that of Italy by 25% and that of Russia and Ukraine by between 28% and 40%.</p> <p>But this trend will be mitigated to some degree by more immigration, the report says, amounting to a net average annual gain in developed countries of about 2m.</p> <p>\"Because of low fertility, this migration has a significant impact ... Without migration, the population of more developed regions as a whole would start declining in 2003 rather than in 2025.\"</p> <p>Britain, for example, has a fertility level of only 1.6 but its total population, currently 59m, is likely to be about the same in 2050, owing to immigration.</p> <p>The United States is likely to remain a prime target for migrants, giving it an annual influx of about 1m people and a projected population by 2050 of about 400m; it has 280m now.</p> <p>The report suggests that Africa, one of the areas of biggest population growth, will have three times as many people as Europe by 2050 - in all, 2bn Africans against 800m now. That compares starkly with the situation in 1950, when Europe accounted for almost a quarter of the world's population and Africa only 8%.</p> <p>The population explosion in Africa, Asia and Latin America would be even more dramatic but for the impact of the HIV/Aids epidemic, the report says. But despite an expected 300m deaths in 50 years, the continent's population will still rise.</p> <p>\"For the nine most HIV affected countries in Africa, the population is projected to increase from 115m in 2000 to 196m in 2050. Even in Botswana, where HIV prevalence is 36%, or in Swaziland and Zimbabwe, where it is above 25%, the numbers are projected to increase significantly; by 37% in Botswana, 148% in Swaziland and 86% in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>\"Only in South Africa, whose fertility is lower than that of Botswana or Zimbabwe, does the growth rate of the population become negative during 2010-2025, being positive thereafter.\"</p> <p>Although Aids has reduced life expectancy by three years in the 45 countries worst hit, the average human life span is still increasing there and elsewhere.</p> <p>Futhermore, the life expectancy gap between rich and poor countries appears to be closing. In less developed regions, life expectancy will increasby 12 years, to 75, in the next 50 years; in developed regions, it will rise by seven years, from the current 75 years to 82. In Britain, life expectancy is currently 78 years, rising to 83 by 2050.</p> <p>The prospect for the industrial world is one of elderly populations and shrinking workforces ever more dependent on migrant labour.</p> <p>\"The older population of the more developed regions has already surpassed the child population and by 2050, there will be two older persons for every child.\"</p> <p>One-fifth of all Europeans were aged 60 or more in 1998.

Even this startling projection is based on the assumption that fertility will continue to decline. If that failed to happen, the population of less developed regions would reach an enormous 11.9bn. Looked at another way, the UN figures suggest that within 50 years nine out of every 10 people will be living in a developing country. One in every six will be living in India where the current population of just over 1bn is projected to rise by 600m. By contrast, population levels in Europe and Japan are projected to decline sharply because fertility is falling below the \"replacement level\" - that is to say, below an average of 2.1 children a woman. By mid-century the populations of Germany and Japan will have fallen on current trends by 14%, that of Italy by 25% and that of Russia and Ukraine by between 28% and 40%. But this trend will be mitigated to some degree by more immigration, the report says, amounting to a net average annual gain in developed countries of about 2m. \"Because of low fertility, this migration has a significant impact ... Without migration, the population of more developed regions as a whole would start declining in 2003 rather than in 2025.\" Britain, for example, has a fertility level of only 1.6 but its total population, currently 59m, is likely to be about the same in 2050, owing to immigration. The United States is likely to remain a prime target for migrants, giving it an annual influx of about 1m people and a projected population by 2050 of about 400m; it has 280m now. The report suggests that Africa, one of the areas of biggest population growth, will have three times as many people as Europe by 2050 - in all, 2bn Africans against 800m now. That compares starkly with the situation in 1950, when Europe accounted for almost a quarter of the world's population and Africa only 8%. The population explosion in Africa, Asia and Latin America would be even more dramatic but for the impact of the HIV/Aids epidemic, the report says. But despite an expected 300m deaths in 50 years, the continent's population will still rise. \"For the nine most HIV affected countries in Africa, the population is projected to increase from 115m in 2000 to 196m in 2050. Even in Botswana, where HIV prevalence is 36%, or in Swaziland and Zimbabwe, where it is above 25%, the numbers are projected to increase significantly; by 37% in Botswana, 148% in Swaziland and 86% in Zimbabwe. \"Only in South Africa, whose fertility is lower than that of Botswana or Zimbabwe, does the growth rate of the population become negative during 2010-2025, being positive thereafter.\" Although Aids has reduced life expectancy by three years in the 45 countries worst hit, the average human life span is still increasing there and elsewhere. Futhermore, the life expectancy gap between rich and poor countries appears to be closing. In less developed regions, life expectancy will increasby 12 years, to 75, in the next 50 years; in developed regions, it will rise by seven years, from the current 75 years to 82. In Britain, life expectancy is currently 78 years, rising to 83 by 2050. The prospect for the industrial world is one of elderly populations and shrinking workforces ever more dependent on migrant labour. \"The older population of the more developed regions has already surpassed the child population and by 2050, there will be two older persons for every child.\" One-fifth of all Europeans were aged 60 or more in 1998. By 2050 they may represent more than one-third of all adults, with children making up only 14% of the population. Useful link UN population division",

      "bodyText": "A Russian colonel went on trial yesterday for kidnapping and murdering an 18-year-old Chechen woman, the first member of the Russian forces prosecuted for human rights abuse since the war in Chechnya began. Colonel Yury Budanov, commander of the 160th Tank Regiment, admitted killing Kheda Kungaeva, from Tangi Chu, but denied that it was murder. Relatives of the dead girl, squeezed in beside army officers in the courtroom in the southern town of Rostov-on-Don, had little confidence that justice would be done. Outside, a handful of Col Budanov's supporters protested against his trial, saying he was being sacrificed because the army wanted to be seen willing to prosecute officers. While cautiously welcoming the trial, human rights groups remain critical of widespread Russian reluctance to investigate or prosecute troops for dozens of other alleged atrocities against civilians. According to an investigation by Human Rights Watch, Kungaeva died at the end of a a drunken night last March when the colonel celebrated his daughter's birthday with fellow soldiers at Tangi Chu. Sometime after midnight he and three others took an armoured personnel carrier, drove into the Kungaev family's front garden, walked into the house, and took Kheda away. About two hours later, it is alleged, Col Budanov strangled her. She was buried, but her body was dug up and returned to her family two days later. Col Budanov is alleged to have said that he detained Kungaeva because he thought she was a sniper who had killed some of his comrades. He claims that he lost his temper and strangled her during an interrogation. A medical examination of her body suggested that she had been raped, the press reported. After the murder senior officers sought to make an example of Col Budanov and repeatedly and publicly accused him of rape and murder. The Kungaeva family are angry that the rape charges were dropped. The army portrayed Col Budanov's behaviour as \"an exceptional example of wanton criminality by a serviceman,\" a Human Rights Watch spokesman said, but abduction rape and murder represented a pattern of crimes perpetrated by federal forces in Chechnya. \"If there is only this one trial ... then it would be not a step forward but just a show trial.\" As the trial opened, reports of other alleged abuses by the Russian military continued to surface from Chechnya. The Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, Alvaro Gil-Robles, who arrived in Chechnya yesterday, said he would try to investigate the claim by the journalist Anna Politkovskaya that Chechen villagers were being persecuted by Russian forces. The bodies of 20 more Chechens were found in a mass grave yesterday in the deserted and ruined holiday village near the main Russian garrison at Khankala, outside the capital, Grozny. Thirty-six corpses have been unearthed since the weekend. In a rare interview published yesterday, the Chechen independence leader Aslan Maskhadov called on the Russians to begin talks. \"Wars have to end at some point and this can only be done by talks,\" he said. Russian officials refuse to talk to the rebel leaders.",

      "bodyText": "Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic began moving gold out of the country even before he lost the elections last autumn, according to allegations in the Serbian press. The Belgrade prosecutor's office ordered the police to investigate the reports yesterday: the first legal move against Mr Milosevic Speculation that Mr Milosevic, who is under police guard in the exclusive Dedinje district of the city, could be arrested within days has been rife. On Friday his secretive former head of the interior ministry, Rade Markovic, was arrested and accused of ordering the murder of four members of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement in October 1999. Up to 12 former police officers have been arrested, and others are said to have fled across the border into Republika Srpska, the Serb-run statelet in Bosnia. Officials are trying to dampen the public excitement surrounding the possible arrest of Mr Milosevic, insisting that the investigations must strictly follow the law. The Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunic, the constitutional lawyer who defeated Mr Milosevic in elections on 26 September, has spoken out against \"revolutionary justice\". \"Milosevic will not be charged until all facts have been established,\" the deputy prime minister, Zarko Korac, told the newspaper Blic yesterday. Mr Korac is one of the few ministers to support the former president's extradition to the Hague. But an anonymous official told the news agency Beta yesterday that a deadline of March 10 had been set for Mr Milosevic's arrest. The latest reports suggest that 173kg (380lb) of gold was taken out of Yugoslavia illegally between September 21 and November 2 last year, and that money from its sale was transferred to bank accounts in Cyprus and Greece. Yugoslavia has been under growing international pressure to arrest Mr Milosevic. But while the new authorities in Belgrade say he should be charged with any political murders and economic offences in his own country, the international war crimes tribunal insists that he should be tried in the Hague for genocide. Carla del Ponte, the tribunal's chief prosecutor, said yesterday: \"I have heard too often that public opinion in Yugoslavia is not ready to accept international justice, or that the persons indicted by the tribunal would become heroes if delivered to the Hague . \"I strongly reject these statement, which ... stand in blatant contradiction with the great many messages we keep receiving from members of the [ruling Yugoslav] DOS coalition, from government officials in Belgrade, from Montenegro, from Vojvodina, local NGO's and groups of ordinary citizens. Ms Del Ponte was in Sweden to press the EU, of which Sweden holds the rotating presidency, to make aid to Yugoslavia conditional on full its cooperation with the tribunal. She also suggested March 31 as a deadline for the authorities in Belgrade to prove that they are willing to do so. Nick Wood in Pristina adds : A Serb policeman was injured when heavy fighting, including artillery, mortar and machine-gun fire, broke out yesterday along a 25-mile stretch of the provinical border between Kosovo and southern Serbia. Earlier, Russian soldiers serving with the Nato-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, reported the discovery of an elderly Serb couple who had been beaten to death with an axe in their home, four miles inside the Kosovan border. The fighting on the boundary came less than 24 hours after Nato foreign ministers decided to draw back the three-mile buffer zone in Serbia which ethnic Albanian rebels have used to launch their attacks on Yugoslav forces.",

All 58 were found to have suffocated.</p> <p>Wacker, 32, from Rotterdam, denies 58 counts of manslaughter and four of conspiring to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants. Ying Guo, 29, a Chinese interpreter, denies a charge of conspiring to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants. She also pleaded not guilty.</p> <p>Opening the case for the crown, Victor Temple QC said Wacker helped load the Chinese into the refrigerated container on his lorry, hiding them behind a cargo of tomatoes on June 18.</p> <p>The 60 illegal immigrants had paid a Snakehead criminal gang to smuggle them from China to Europe.</p> <p>They gathered from two safehouses at a warehouse in Rotterdam's Waalhaven docks before climbing aboard Wacker's lorry.</p> <p>\"These luckless and unfortunate people were obliged to sit or squat in that airtight container with little or no room to move, diminishing amount of air and only a little amount of water,\" Mr Temple said.</p> <p>Around 2.30pm that afternoon Wacker set off for the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, passing through Antwerp and Ghent before reaching Zeebrugge around 6pm.</p> <p>Throughout the journey, the small air vent of the container was tied open with a piece of rope to prevent it swinging closed.</p> <p>Before boarding the ferry, however, Wacker closed the vent, Mr Temple said.</p> <p>\"Wacker closed the vent and the prosecution says that in doing so, he sealed the fate of 58 of the 60 inside. The reason for closing of the vent was to prevent customs or the ferry company hearing noises of any kind from inside the container.</p> <p>\"During the crossing Wacker made no effort to check on the welfare of the Chinese. Instead he contented himself with a meal and watching films upstairs.</p> <p>\"All this by a man who knew of the appalling conditions of the container. That it was hot and there was deprivation seemed to be of no concern to him.</p> <p>\"The vents would remain closed until after the lorry reached customs in Dover. The vent was closed between 6pm and 6.30pm and the lorry boarded the ferry at 7.15pm. Just after 12.15am on June 19 the driver drove off the ferry.\"</p> <p>When customs officials discovered the bodies Wacker remained impassive, the jury of nine women and three men was told.</p> <p>\"Wacker was standing nearby totally unmoved. He had no sympathy, no nothing. The crown say commercial gain took precedence over human life.\"</p> <p>The court would heard that Wacker and Guo were part of a criminal conspiracy organised by the Snakehead gang.</p> <p>\"Both the defendants... had aligned themselves to and were playing an important part in the plan to smuggle these 60 people. Both knew that others were involved and that behind the operation was a professional crime syndicate, the Snakeheads,\" he said.</p> <p>The Snakehead smugglers trade on the privations of life in China, encouraging people to flee for the west for as much as \u00a320,000 each. As the money is paid in instalments the Snakeheads take care to protect their investment and minders accompany the illegal immigrants at all times, the court was told. In Rotterdam the Snakeheads' interests, and the final preparations for the transport, were represented by a Turkish gang who engaged Wacker.</p> <p>Wacker was closely involved in the purchase of the lorry and trailer, and advised others in the purchase of the container.</p> <p>He also paid for and collected the tomatoes that were to act as the dummy cargo, along with a friend and fellow conspirator Leo Nijveen, also a Dutch lorry driver. Wacker helped construct a frame in the rear of the container on which the tomatoes were placed, the jury heard.</p> <p>\"Wacker does not fall into the role of a driver who is recruited at the last minute or on a 'backhander', accepting at the last minute. He was much more deeply involved,\" said Mr Temple.</p> <p>DNA found on cigarette butts and fingerprints on offcuts of wood showed beyond doubt that Wacker was in the warehouse at Waalhaven and knew his cargo was human, Mr Temple said.</p> <p>The court heard that Ying Guo, of South Woodford, London, who arrived in the UK as a student in 1996, was crucial to the British end of the conspiracy.</p> <p>\"She played an important role in furthering the process of illegal entry,\" Mr Temple said.</p> <p>\"She was on hand to assist should the customs or immigration discover anything at the port. She was also in a position to allow the organisers to retain control over the immigrants until the final payment was made.</p> <p>\"Her assistance was also in making false asylum claims. She had the expertise and was familiar with the process.\"</p> <p>Guo worked as an interpreter for a number of solicitors' firms in London involved in the processing of asylum claims, the court heard.</p> <p>Some 27 of the deceased had Ms Guo's mobile telephone number written on scraps of paper or on the fabric of their clothes, and the number was found on another 60 items that had been discarded as temperatures in the container soared.</p> <p>At 8.30am on the morning after the deceased had been discovered, she rang a solicitor, a Mr Wolpita of Attanayake solicitors, Mr temple said. She told him she had 60 cases arriving that day and asked if he could assist in their asylum claims.</p> <p>He said he could handle 30 if he had formal requests for his services. Guo did not call him back until after midnight when she said her computer had been taken by police and asked his advice.</p> <p>The next day she turned herself in to police at Canterbury, Kent, with her boyfriend, You Yi, who was subsequently released.</p> <p>\"She was part of an illegal organisation involved in the systematic flouting of British law, the same organisation to which Perry Wacker and Leo Nijveen had aligned themselves to,\" Mr Temple said.</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",

All 58 were found to have suffocated. Wacker, 32, from Rotterdam, denies 58 counts of manslaughter and four of conspiring to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants. Ying Guo, 29, a Chinese interpreter, denies a charge of conspiring to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants. She also pleaded not guilty. Opening the case for the crown, Victor Temple QC said Wacker helped load the Chinese into the refrigerated container on his lorry, hiding them behind a cargo of tomatoes on June 18. The 60 illegal immigrants had paid a Snakehead criminal gang to smuggle them from China to Europe. They gathered from two safehouses at a warehouse in Rotterdam's Waalhaven docks before climbing aboard Wacker's lorry. \"These luckless and unfortunate people were obliged to sit or squat in that airtight container with little or no room to move, diminishing amount of air and only a little amount of water,\" Mr Temple said. Around 2.30pm that afternoon Wacker set off for the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, passing through Antwerp and Ghent before reaching Zeebrugge around 6pm. Throughout the journey, the small air vent of the container was tied open with a piece of rope to prevent it swinging closed. Before boarding the ferry, however, Wacker closed the vent, Mr Temple said. \"Wacker closed the vent and the prosecution says that in doing so, he sealed the fate of 58 of the 60 inside. The reason for closing of the vent was to prevent customs or the ferry company hearing noises of any kind from inside the container. \"During the crossing Wacker made no effort to check on the welfare of the Chinese. Instead he contented himself with a meal and watching films upstairs. \"All this by a man who knew of the appalling conditions of the container. That it was hot and there was deprivation seemed to be of no concern to him. \"The vents would remain closed until after the lorry reached customs in Dover. The vent was closed between 6pm and 6.30pm and the lorry boarded the ferry at 7.15pm. Just after 12.15am on June 19 the driver drove off the ferry.\" When customs officials discovered the bodies Wacker remained impassive, the jury of nine women and three men was told. \"Wacker was standing nearby totally unmoved. He had no sympathy, no nothing. The crown say commercial gain took precedence over human life.\" The court would heard that Wacker and Guo were part of a criminal conspiracy organised by the Snakehead gang. \"Both the defendants... had aligned themselves to and were playing an important part in the plan to smuggle these 60 people. Both knew that others were involved and that behind the operation was a professional crime syndicate, the Snakeheads,\" he said. The Snakehead smugglers trade on the privations of life in China, encouraging people to flee for the west for as much as \u00a320,000 each. As the money is paid in instalments the Snakeheads take care to protect their investment and minders accompany the illegal immigrants at all times, the court was told. In Rotterdam the Snakeheads' interests, and the final preparations for the transport, were represented by a Turkish gang who engaged Wacker. Wacker was closely involved in the purchase of the lorry and trailer, and advised others in the purchase of the container. He also paid for and collected the tomatoes that were to act as the dummy cargo, along with a friend and fellow conspirator Leo Nijveen, also a Dutch lorry driver. Wacker helped construct a frame in the rear of the container on which the tomatoes were placed, the jury heard. \"Wacker does not fall into the role of a driver who is recruited at the last minute or on a 'backhander', accepting at the last minute. He was much more deeply involved,\" said Mr Temple. DNA found on cigarette butts and fingerprints on offcuts of wood showed beyond doubt that Wacker was in the warehouse at Waalhaven and knew his cargo was human, Mr Temple said. The court heard that Ying Guo, of South Woodford, London, who arrived in the UK as a student in 1996, was crucial to the British end of the conspiracy. \"She played an important role in furthering the process of illegal entry,\" Mr Temple said. \"She was on hand to assist should the customs or immigration discover anything at the port. She was also in a position to allow the organisers to retain control over the immigrants until the final payment was made. \"Her assistance was also in making false asylum claims. She had the expertise and was familiar with the process.\" Guo worked as an interpreter for a number of solicitors' firms in London involved in the processing of asylum claims, the court heard. Some 27 of the deceased had Ms Guo's mobile telephone number written on scraps of paper or on the fabric of their clothes, and the number was found on another 60 items that had been discarded as temperatures in the container soared. At 8.30am on the morning after the deceased had been discovered, she rang a solicitor, a Mr Wolpita of Attanayake solicitors, Mr temple said. She told him she had 60 cases arriving that day and asked if he could assist in their asylum claims. He said he could handle 30 if he had formal requests for his services. Guo did not call him back until after midnight when she said her computer had been taken by police and asked his advice. The next day she turned herself in to police at Canterbury, Kent, with her boyfriend, You Yi, who was subsequently released. \"She was part of an illegal organisation involved in the systematic flouting of British law, the same organisation to which Perry Wacker and Leo Nijveen had aligned themselves to,\" Mr Temple said. The case continues.",

I went to have a look at his site - and found it was my site. </p> <p>\"It looked different, but the words were verbatim.

It is usually the law in the country in which the website is hosted that will apply. </p> <p>\"As always with the internet, there's a difference between what the law says - thou shalt not copy somebody else's copyrighted work - and the practice.\" </p> <p>The good news is that most countries are signatories to the Berne convention, which requires states to recognise \"moral rights of integrity and attribution\". But the law may still vary from place to place. In the US, the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act says an online service provider must take down a website if you allege it violates your rights - or become liable for damages. </p> <p>Slocombe, a long-standing opponent of tough legislation such as the Criminal Justice Act and the RIP Act, describes this law as open to misuse, because protest sites that can't afford to fight legal claims could end up being intimidated. </p> <p>But if the website declares it will defend itself against your claim, you have just 10 days to bring a case - or the service provider must put the site back up. So you have to be prepared . </p> <p>The problem for a one-man show such as Urban 75 is that hardball is an expensive game to play. The Church of Scientology, famously litigious, has been an aggressive defender of its online copyright. </p> <p>So Slocombe used a radical tactic: posting comparisons of the two sites on Urban 75, plus a section (later removed) inviting his readers to email concerns to Narconon and its service provider, Earthlink. </p> <p>Earthlink has not replied to either the Guardian or, we understand, Urban 75. The company was founded by a Scientologist, Sky Dayton, although it has distanced itself from the church. </p> <p>Narconon, it appears, did get a reply. According to Smith's email, \"Earthlink did not see that there was any problem with the Narconon websites\". The ISP, he adds, was \"very concerned about the number of unsolicited emails that Narconon and Earthlink were receiving at the request of Urban 75.\" </p> <p>But Urban 75 has won small victories. Narconon took down the \"no tie-ins\" phrase the day Slocombe wrote to them. They tweaked the graphics - replacing the orange chevrons first with an orange blob, then yellow arrows. They eventually removed the JavaScript function. Narconon made such changes, Smith says, because it \"wanted to resolve all concerns amicably\". </p> <p>Small victories, but valuable to Slocombe, a man wedded to his online obsession. \"I don't want people confusing my work with theirs.\"</p> <p><strong> How to protect copyright online</strong><br> Companies have responded to copyright protection requirements by offering digital rights management services, which attempt to track copyrighted work on the net. Examples include <a href=\"http://www.siteprotector.com\">www.siteprotector.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.contentguard.com\">www.contentguard.com</a>. </p> <p>To prove copyright in graphics, digital watermarking has been built into image manipulation programs such as Adobe PhotoShop. You buy into the service from a company such as Digimarc, and they will give you a watermark to use on your images. Under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, interfering with such watermarks or other anti-copyright devices will create copyright liability. Although not having it does not mean you aren't protected, it is always a good idea to put a clear copyright notice on your site. A licence or disclaimer telling users they are welcome to make copies for personal, but not commercial use, is typical.</p>",

But if the website declares it will defend itself against your claim, you have just 10 days to bring a case - or the service provider must put the site back up. So you have to be prepared . The problem for a one-man show such as Urban 75 is that hardball is an expensive game to play. The Church of Scientology, famously litigious, has been an aggressive defender of its online copyright. So Slocombe used a radical tactic: posting comparisons of the two sites on Urban 75, plus a section (later removed) inviting his readers to email concerns to Narconon and its service provider, Earthlink. Earthlink has not replied to either the Guardian or, we understand, Urban 75. The company was founded by a Scientologist, Sky Dayton, although it has distanced itself from the church. Narconon, it appears, did get a reply. According to Smith's email, \"Earthlink did not see that there was any problem with the Narconon websites\". The ISP, he adds, was \"very concerned about the number of unsolicited emails that Narconon and Earthlink were receiving at the request of Urban 75.\" But Urban 75 has won small victories. Narconon took down the \"no tie-ins\" phrase the day Slocombe wrote to them. They tweaked the graphics - replacing the orange chevrons first with an orange blob, then yellow arrows. They eventually removed the JavaScript function. Narconon made such changes, Smith says, because it \"wanted to resolve all concerns amicably\". Small victories, but valuable to Slocombe, a man wedded to his online obsession. \"I don't want people confusing my work with theirs.\" How to protect copyright online Companies have responded to copyright protection requirements by offering digital rights management services, which attempt to track copyrighted work on the net. Examples include www.siteprotector.com and www.contentguard.com. To prove copyright in graphics, digital watermarking has been built into image manipulation programs such as Adobe PhotoShop. You buy into the service from a company such as Digimarc, and they will give you a watermark to use on your images. Under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, interfering with such watermarks or other anti-copyright devices will create copyright liability. Although not having it does not mean you aren't protected, it is always a good idea to put a clear copyright notice on your site. A licence or disclaimer telling users they are welcome to make copies for personal, but not commercial use, is typical.",

      "body": "<p>Amid all the tawdry horror stories, the mothy contents of the shelves of pulp fiction faint away before the hand of the master - H. P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft's stories of demoniac orgies are dreadfully overcooked. But one of his more tenacious tales is The Rats In The Walls, in which the scion of a noble house, tainted with a half-remembered disgrace, returns from America to restore Exham Priory, his ancient seat in the Welsh Marches. Found beneath the house are cellars and basements of horror, revealing centuries of grisly rites into which our hero descends, to become a gibbering wreck. How thin our veneer of civilisation becomes, it seems, when confronted with our shameful past. </p> <p>We all live in our own evolutionary rendition of Lovecraft's tale. From the chthonic abyss of deep time comes the tale of ourselves. New research shows how long ago, when our fishy ancestors were evolving from the common shoal, they had to rid themselves of a stench we have successfully kept buried in a mental sub-basement. Hidden, that is, until now. </p> <p>Here is the tale by which we should like to have ourselves remembered. Around 400 million years ago, the first bony fishes appeared, and soon after, the first bony fishes with \"lobed\" fins - fins supported on a skeleton of bones. Some of these lobe-finned bony fishes evolved to become coelacanths and lungfishes, and others came ashore, the lobed fins becoming legs. Many other kinds of lobe-finned fishes thronged seas and rivers, but almost all died out millions of years ago. </p> <p>The origins of lobe-finned fishes have remained obscure until recently, when palaeontologists working in southern China stumbled across what seems to have been a motherlode - the cradle of lobe- finned fishes and, ultimately, ourselves. </p> <p>Four hundred million years ago, what is now Yunnan province in China was an isolated continent that saw the earliest days of lobe-finned evolution. One of the earliest fishes was a creature called Psarolepis, the discoverers of whom had no reason to doubt the respectability of its ancestry. </p> <p>Now here lies the true story, with the lid of the grave ripped off and the ghastly contents clear to see. When Xiabo Yu of Kean University in New Jersey, with Min Zhu, now of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology in Beijing, found a few more specimens of Psarolepis, they were in for a shock. For Psarolepis had some fins armoured with huge, archaic-looking plates and wicked spines. Such furniture had been seen, but only in extremely primitive, extinct fishes called placoderms and acanthodians. The lesson was clear - when lobe-finned fishes were evolving, they first had to shed some ancient baggage. Psarolepis was sufficiently ancient and primitive to allow researchers to see lobe-finned fishes in the act of sweeping their history under the carpet of time. </p> <p>But matters were not to be hushed up easily. Researchers based in Australia discovered an ancient braincase of a bony fish that appeared to have had eyestalks. In other words, the eyeballs were anchored solidly into the skull by a strip of tissue. This may not sound controversial, but eyestalks are not now seen in any kind of bony fish. Where they are seen, however, is in sharks. The story deepens in a report in today's Nature, in which Xiabo Yu and Min Zhu have teamed up with Per Ahlberg of the Natural History Museum in London (an expert on lobe-finned fishes and Lovecraft devotee) to describe another primitive lobe-fin from Yunnan, which they call Achoania. This creature was not quite as primitive as Psarolepis but like the as-yet-unnamed Australian form, it kept its eyes on stalks. The researchers have examined more specimens of Psarolepis to establish that it, too, had stalked eyes. </p> <p>The story, once confounded with a deceptive shroud of happy ignorance, is now, it seems, clear. Before the lineage of lobe-finned fishes leading to our own high estate had been established, there were once even more primitive forms, armed with spikes incarnadine, bewigged with plates, and bearing eyes on stalks, all the better to turn their dead-cold gaze on an unsuspecting world. It took time for these creatures to bury the evidence of this relationship - but not too much, by evolutionary standards. </p> <p>Within a few million years, lobe-finned fishes of a more respectable visage had appeared. The shedding of our ancient misfortunes happened with almost indecent haste. </p> <p>The story of Psarolepis and Achoania teaches us two lessons. First, we should beware reconstructing primitive ancestral forms based on the appearances of descendants, all of whom may have lost the features of even more primitive creatures: and second, we should beware the sound of rats in the walls, scurrying downwards into regions of innominate terror. </p> <p> \u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature. His book Deep Time comes out in paperback this week, from Fourth Estate.</p>",

Many other kinds of lobe-finned fishes thronged seas and rivers, but almost all died out millions of years ago. The origins of lobe-finned fishes have remained obscure until recently, when palaeontologists working in southern China stumbled across what seems to have been a motherlode - the cradle of lobe- finned fishes and, ultimately, ourselves. Four hundred million years ago, what is now Yunnan province in China was an isolated continent that saw the earliest days of lobe-finned evolution. One of the earliest fishes was a creature called Psarolepis, the discoverers of whom had no reason to doubt the respectability of its ancestry. Now here lies the true story, with the lid of the grave ripped off and the ghastly contents clear to see. When Xiabo Yu of Kean University in New Jersey, with Min Zhu, now of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology in Beijing, found a few more specimens of Psarolepis, they were in for a shock. For Psarolepis had some fins armoured with huge, archaic-looking plates and wicked spines. Such furniture had been seen, but only in extremely primitive, extinct fishes called placoderms and acanthodians. The lesson was clear - when lobe-finned fishes were evolving, they first had to shed some ancient baggage. Psarolepis was sufficiently ancient and primitive to allow researchers to see lobe-finned fishes in the act of sweeping their history under the carpet of time. But matters were not to be hushed up easily. Researchers based in Australia discovered an ancient braincase of a bony fish that appeared to have had eyestalks. In other words, the eyeballs were anchored solidly into the skull by a strip of tissue. This may not sound controversial, but eyestalks are not now seen in any kind of bony fish. Where they are seen, however, is in sharks. The story deepens in a report in today's Nature, in which Xiabo Yu and Min Zhu have teamed up with Per Ahlberg of the Natural History Museum in London (an expert on lobe-finned fishes and Lovecraft devotee) to describe another primitive lobe-fin from Yunnan, which they call Achoania. This creature was not quite as primitive as Psarolepis but like the as-yet-unnamed Australian form, it kept its eyes on stalks. The researchers have examined more specimens of Psarolepis to establish that it, too, had stalked eyes. The story, once confounded with a deceptive shroud of happy ignorance, is now, it seems, clear. Before the lineage of lobe-finned fishes leading to our own high estate had been established, there were once even more primitive forms, armed with spikes incarnadine, bewigged with plates, and bearing eyes on stalks, all the better to turn their dead-cold gaze on an unsuspecting world. It took time for these creatures to bury the evidence of this relationship - but not too much, by evolutionary standards. Within a few million years, lobe-finned fishes of a more respectable visage had appeared. The shedding of our ancient misfortunes happened with almost indecent haste. The story of Psarolepis and Achoania teaches us two lessons. First, we should beware reconstructing primitive ancestral forms based on the appearances of descendants, all of whom may have lost the features of even more primitive creatures: and second, we should beware the sound of rats in the walls, scurrying downwards into regions of innominate terror. \u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature.

But in the late 1970s Terry Erwin, from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, counted the beetles on a single tree in Panama and found that most were unknown to science. He concluded (by contrived but plausible maths) that the true number of species on Earth was probably around 30 million. </p> <p>From the 1980s onwards, Professor Norm Pace (now at Colorado) and his colleagues searched the environment for traces of bacterial DNA - and estimated that for every bacterium described, there were probably around 10,000 that had escaped detection. Since about 40,000 \"species\" were known, the true number was probably around 400 million. That must be added to Erwin's 30 million species. Several thousand years of formal natural history have revealed much less than 1% of what is probably out there. </p> <p>Ways of life are proving immensely various, too. We live at modest temperatures and call that normal: life, we used to be told, cannot survive much above 40 C. But since the 1980s, more and more bacteria have turned up in hot springs. Many are so primitive that they must be close to the ancestors of all living types. So they are the \"normal\", pristine ones: we, other animals and oak trees are anomalously adapted to the cold. (We should call ourselves \"cryophiles\": cold-lovers). Meanwhile, other bacteria turn up in the strangest places: living on rock half a mile beneath Earth's surface, or gnawing away at German statues from the inside. Our way of living (eating other things) and that of plants (photosynthesis) are just two options among many. </p> <p>Then there is the sheer range of type. The first modern taxonomist (classifier) was Carolus Linnaeus in 18th-century Sweden, who decreed that all creatures should be placed in two kingdoms: Animalia or Plantae. Later biologists found this too cavalier and by the 1950s we had five kingdoms, with fungi, protozoans and bacteria separated. But in the late 1970s, pioneer RNA studies by Carl Woese at the University of Illinois showed that this was nonsense. Bacteria are so vastly different from \"eukaryotes\" (protozoans, fungi, animals and plants - creatures whose cells have nuclei) that they must be put in their own domain. </p> <p>Yet the so-called bacteria were not all of a piece. Clearly there were two vastly different types. One type Woese placed in the domain Bacteria and the other he put in their own domain, the Archaea, colloquially called archaes (pronounced arkies). All the eukaryotes form a third domain, the Eucarya. Within the Eucarya, Linnaeus's Animalia and Plantae now form just two kingdoms among about a dozen: for the various protozoans and seaweeds, slime-moulds and fungi are proving to be at least as different from each other as animals are from plants, and each deserves a kingdom of its own. Meanwhile, DNA trawls in the Southern Ocean suggest that archaes may be the most common organisms on Earth. No one had heard of them until the late 1970s. </p> <p>As DNA studies progress, the relationships between this deluge of creatures seems ever weirder. Fungi, which Linnaeus and many botanists since rammed in among plants, now prove to be more closely related to animals. Genetically speaking, a mushroom is more like us than it is like an oak tree. But as more molecules are studied, the picture changes. Just a few years ago the red seaweeds seemed so different from plants that they were almost off the edge of life's genealogical tree. Now they seem to be their closest relatives. Brown seaweeds, such as wracks, still seem distinct. But the green seaweeds, like \"sea-lettuce\", are plants. </p> <p>Then there were strange, parasitic protozoans called microsporidia. They seemed so basic they were surely among the most primitive of all eukaryotes, close to the ancestor of us all. But molecular studies at London's Natural History Museum reveal them to be degenerate fungi. This matters, for although microsporidia do little harm to healthy people, they devastate those whose immunity is compromised - as in HIV infection. Doctors can now treat the fungi accordingly.

Some are as distinct in their DNA as cats are from dogs. Sometimes, only DNA will show the differences. Some North American owls look the same but the owls can tell each other apart by their voices. The differences in DNA prove they do not interbreed and so are separate species. </p> <p>But Professor Bearder probably won't get to all the bushbabies before the forests disappear.

You can use back-up software to capture everything on your PC, and after that, take \"incremental back-ups\". In other words, back up only the files that have changed.

      "body": "<p>Ever been stranded in a foreign city with no taxis to be found? A short message service - shown at the GSM Mobile Congress in Cannes - could mean your ride home is just an SMS away. </p> <p>The idea is you send an SMS text message from your mobile saying where you want to go and you receive confirmation saying who the driver is, his mobile, the cab registration number and so on. The message also tells you how soon the cab will arrive. You get another SMS when the taxi arrives. </p> <p>The software for U-go is being developed by Logica, a UK computer services company, but the idea and specification were dreamed up by brothers Lionel and Eli Cohen, of the London-based Obvious Solutions. </p> <p>Lionel says: \"We got the idea after having to wait so long for cabs in the city after working late. But we soon realised the service would be even more useful for people travelling abroad. </p> <p>\"Travellers don't need to know a local taxi number to use U-go and the instructions can be as simple as typing in the name of the place you want to be picked up from. Alternatively, using a phone with a built-in global positioning system like one soon to be sold by Benefon, users could just select 'Taxi' from a menu and it would relay their location to the taxi firm.\" </p> <p>Obvious, Logica and Hewlett-Packard imported two London cabbies to ferry visitors around Cannes, where the largest European mobile phone exhibition is held every year. Tony Lazzam, one of the drivers, says: \"It's in its early stages, but I think it could be a big success.\" </p> <p>Obvious plans to sign up reputable local firms in major European cities and across the UK. The first two companies to sign are Radio Taxis and Addison Lee, a large minicab company, in London. Once the service goes live in April, users can register by typing in their mobile number and payment details at the service's web site. </p> <p>They can also set up short cuts for regular trips so that, for example, \"h\" means pick me up from the home address specified and \"h2w\" means take me from home to work. </p> <p>The SMSs are logged on a computer server run by Logica, which interacts with the cab companies' computerised despatch systems. For smaller operations, which still write everything on paper, Logica is developing an internet site they can use just for SMS bookings. SMSs are also used to send instructions to drivers. </p> <p>Logica and the Cohen brothers hope to make money by charging users and cab firms an SMS booking fee of around 50p each and, if providing the service in conjunction with a mobile operator, they will get a share of the 10p SMS charge. </p> <p>The service is still being refined. My booking to go from: Cannes station to GSM (my abbreviation for the Palais des Festivals et des Congres exhibition hall) was replied to quickly. But when I typed in \"cash\" in response to a request for a payment code, nothing happened, requiring a call to Eli Cohen's mobile. This may be because Obvious is planning to bill to credit cards or mobile phone bills. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the service was good enough to wish it had been running after 6pm last Thursday. On a cold winter evening on the Cote d'Azur after the Nokia party, there were no taxis either at the taxi rank on La Croisette or at the Noga Hilton. One exhibitor from Wireless Entertainment Services said he had walked five kilometres to his hotel, swearing in Finnish all the way. </p> <p>\u0095 From April the service will be available at: <a href=\"http://www.Obvious.com  \">www.Obvious.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Ever been stranded in a foreign city with no taxis to be found? A short message service - shown at the GSM Mobile Congress in Cannes - could mean your ride home is just an SMS away. The idea is you send an SMS text message from your mobile saying where you want to go and you receive confirmation saying who the driver is, his mobile, the cab registration number and so on. The message also tells you how soon the cab will arrive. You get another SMS when the taxi arrives. The software for U-go is being developed by Logica, a UK computer services company, but the idea and specification were dreamed up by brothers Lionel and Eli Cohen, of the London-based Obvious Solutions. Lionel says: \"We got the idea after having to wait so long for cabs in the city after working late. But we soon realised the service would be even more useful for people travelling abroad. \"Travellers don't need to know a local taxi number to use U-go and the instructions can be as simple as typing in the name of the place you want to be picked up from. Alternatively, using a phone with a built-in global positioning system like one soon to be sold by Benefon, users could just select 'Taxi' from a menu and it would relay their location to the taxi firm.\" Obvious, Logica and Hewlett-Packard imported two London cabbies to ferry visitors around Cannes, where the largest European mobile phone exhibition is held every year. Tony Lazzam, one of the drivers, says: \"It's in its early stages, but I think it could be a big success.\" Obvious plans to sign up reputable local firms in major European cities and across the UK. The first two companies to sign are Radio Taxis and Addison Lee, a large minicab company, in London. Once the service goes live in April, users can register by typing in their mobile number and payment details at the service's web site. They can also set up short cuts for regular trips so that, for example, \"h\" means pick me up from the home address specified and \"h2w\" means take me from home to work. The SMSs are logged on a computer server run by Logica, which interacts with the cab companies' computerised despatch systems. For smaller operations, which still write everything on paper, Logica is developing an internet site they can use just for SMS bookings. SMSs are also used to send instructions to drivers. Logica and the Cohen brothers hope to make money by charging users and cab firms an SMS booking fee of around 50p each and, if providing the service in conjunction with a mobile operator, they will get a share of the 10p SMS charge. The service is still being refined. My booking to go from: Cannes station to GSM (my abbreviation for the Palais des Festivals et des Congres exhibition hall) was replied to quickly. But when I typed in \"cash\" in response to a request for a payment code, nothing happened, requiring a call to Eli Cohen's mobile. This may be because Obvious is planning to bill to credit cards or mobile phone bills. Nevertheless, the service was good enough to wish it had been running after 6pm last Thursday. On a cold winter evening on the Cote d'Azur after the Nokia party, there were no taxis either at the taxi rank on La Croisette or at the Noga Hilton. One exhibitor from Wireless Entertainment Services said he had walked five kilometres to his hotel, swearing in Finnish all the way. \u0095 From April the service will be available at: www.Obvious.com",

      "body": "<p>The New Economy is widely assumed to be intrinsically \"good\", in contrast to the Old Economy, which was all about making money and leaving the planet in a mess. </p> <p> It is easy to see where such ideas come from, but this is a dangerous assumption. Mines, steel mills and the classic elements of the Old Economy conjure up images of environmental degradation and oppressive labour conditions, while dematerialisation obviously consumes fewer physical resources. </p> <p> The danger in equating the New Economy with a better economy lies in the assumption that this will be inevitable - and therefore requires little thought or action on behalf of government, business or consumers. </p> <p> That is not the case, as a year-long study reports today. The Digital Futures project, managed by Forum for the Future, brought together think-tanks such as Demos and the New Economics Foundation to study the social and environmental implications of electronic commerce. Their conclusions are launched today at a conference in London and in a book* detailing the analysis. Their research revealed the extent of New Economy complacency. Of 150 businesses, large and small, two-thirds said that social and environmental issues were important to them, four out of five believed the positive effects of e-commerce on society would outweigh the negative, the ratio of positive to negative statements on environmental impacts was more than four to one, and almost two-thirds agreed that e-commerce would enable companies to be more responsive to ethical and environmental concerns. </p> <p> So what's the problem? The same people then admitted they were doing little to make it happen: four in five companies do nothing to measure or manage their environmental impacts. Two-thirds do nothing to measure or manage social impacts. Four out of five do nothing to measure or manage transport impacts, or offer staff training on environmental or social issues. </p> <p> This alarming gap prompted the Digital Futures team to pose a few infrequently asked questions; why global e-businesses would necessarily be more socially and environmentally responsible than traditional ones; whether connecting everybody to the net would help bind society or tear it apart; what transport patterns would look like in an e-tail economy; and whether there was any chance of long-term thinking in a society working to ever shorter timescales. </p> <p> Most answers were inconclusive, and that is important. The shape and impact of the e-conomy are not inevitable and will not be determined by technology. They will depend on decisions taken by governments and institutions, the actions of businesses and other organisations, and how consumers react. Take the question of the digital divide. Connecting everybody to the net will not of itself attack inequality and exclusion. </p> <p> There are clear dangers that the e-conomy will widen divisions. It is concentrated in an area bordered by London, Cambridge, Birmingham and Bristol. E-businesses look first for consumers among the affluent. The ability to trade efficiently over long distances threatens local economies. </p> <p> A similar scenario can be painted for the environment. More international purchasing means more airfreight. Remote shopping could result in streets clogged by retailers' delivery vans and their exhaust fumes, while consumers make more adventurous shopping trips. </p> <p> E-commerce does not even mean that consumers will be empowered. The growth of auction sites and price- oriented search engines could make it difficult even for concerned consumers to understand the social and environmental implications of their purchases. This is not to say that e-commerce will be bad for society, just that it could be. There are opportunities to tilt the balance towards the positive, but they need to be grasped. </p> <p> Government needs to embrace social and environmental aspects in its e-strategy rather than treating sustainability separately. This could include boosting the role of post offices as hubs of local economies, requiring regional development agencies to help create local electronic markets, and stimulating consumer awareness. Business can do plenty- search engines could help identify products according to social and environmental criteria rather than merely price; co-operation on distribution can avoid the plethora of delivery vans. The new economy can be cleaner, greener and more inclusive, but only if it is made so. If not, it could accentuate the worst characteristics of the old. </p> <p> \u0095 Digital Futures: living in a dot-com world (Earthscan, March 2001).</p>",

      "bodyText": "The New Economy is widely assumed to be intrinsically \"good\", in contrast to the Old Economy, which was all about making money and leaving the planet in a mess. It is easy to see where such ideas come from, but this is a dangerous assumption. Mines, steel mills and the classic elements of the Old Economy conjure up images of environmental degradation and oppressive labour conditions, while dematerialisation obviously consumes fewer physical resources. The danger in equating the New Economy with a better economy lies in the assumption that this will be inevitable - and therefore requires little thought or action on behalf of government, business or consumers. That is not the case, as a year-long study reports today. The Digital Futures project, managed by Forum for the Future, brought together think-tanks such as Demos and the New Economics Foundation to study the social and environmental implications of electronic commerce. Their conclusions are launched today at a conference in London and in a book* detailing the analysis. Their research revealed the extent of New Economy complacency. Of 150 businesses, large and small, two-thirds said that social and environmental issues were important to them, four out of five believed the positive effects of e-commerce on society would outweigh the negative, the ratio of positive to negative statements on environmental impacts was more than four to one, and almost two-thirds agreed that e-commerce would enable companies to be more responsive to ethical and environmental concerns. So what's the problem? The same people then admitted they were doing little to make it happen: four in five companies do nothing to measure or manage their environmental impacts. Two-thirds do nothing to measure or manage social impacts. Four out of five do nothing to measure or manage transport impacts, or offer staff training on environmental or social issues. This alarming gap prompted the Digital Futures team to pose a few infrequently asked questions; why global e-businesses would necessarily be more socially and environmentally responsible than traditional ones; whether connecting everybody to the net would help bind society or tear it apart; what transport patterns would look like in an e-tail economy; and whether there was any chance of long-term thinking in a society working to ever shorter timescales. Most answers were inconclusive, and that is important. The shape and impact of the e-conomy are not inevitable and will not be determined by technology. They will depend on decisions taken by governments and institutions, the actions of businesses and other organisations, and how consumers react. Take the question of the digital divide. Connecting everybody to the net will not of itself attack inequality and exclusion. There are clear dangers that the e-conomy will widen divisions. It is concentrated in an area bordered by London, Cambridge, Birmingham and Bristol. E-businesses look first for consumers among the affluent. The ability to trade efficiently over long distances threatens local economies. A similar scenario can be painted for the environment. More international purchasing means more airfreight. Remote shopping could result in streets clogged by retailers' delivery vans and their exhaust fumes, while consumers make more adventurous shopping trips. E-commerce does not even mean that consumers will be empowered. The growth of auction sites and price- oriented search engines could make it difficult even for concerned consumers to understand the social and environmental implications of their purchases. This is not to say that e-commerce will be bad for society, just that it could be. There are opportunities to tilt the balance towards the positive, but they need to be grasped. Government needs to embrace social and environmental aspects in its e-strategy rather than treating sustainability separately. This could include boosting the role of post offices as hubs of local economies, requiring regional development agencies to help create local electronic markets, and stimulating consumer awareness. Business can do plenty- search engines could help identify products according to social and environmental criteria rather than merely price; co-operation on distribution can avoid the plethora of delivery vans. The new economy can be cleaner, greener and more inclusive, but only if it is made so. If not, it could accentuate the worst characteristics of the old. \u0095 Digital Futures: living in a dot-com world (Earthscan, March 2001).",

      "body": "<p>As you go about your business today, you may think you enjoy relative anonymity and privacy. Not so. In fact, Britain's virtual net curtains are twitching as never before, with new technology adding even greater prying power to the country's one million surveillance cameras. </p> <p>In the past, tracking the movements of the population at large has been impractical - it took a lot of effort and manpower just to watch what one person was up to. </p> <p>But, along with the government's acquired abilities to track its citizens as they move about the internet through the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, computerisation means we can also be tracked in the material world. </p> <p>Moreover, it can be done cheaply, with increasing accuracy and almost invisibly. Your mobile phone constantly gives your approximate position. More precisely, you can be watched walking the streets, your car is (routinely) tracked along major roads, and card-based transactions leave a virtual paper trail. </p> <p>On the front line, catching all who cross their gaze, are surveillance cameras, of which Britain has more than any European country. Most, at the moment, are connected to video-tape recorders. But computerisation is coming, allowing cameras to \"recognise\" a face in a crowd. </p> <p>In 1998, the London borough of Newham connected the US firm Visionics' software to cameras covering one shopping area, and this year will extend the system to its fifth. With the face-recognition software, Bob Lack, group leader of security services, says Newham has improved crime rates relative to other boroughs. \"In street robberies and burglaries in particular, we've seen a dramatic drop,\" he says (although some academics say that cameras merely displace criminals to other locations or activity). </p> <p>The system tries to match faces on Newham's cameras to a \"watch list\" of between 100 and 150 active criminals, chosen by a Metropolitan Police committee. The software shows probable matches to a Newham employee - who does not see the suspect's name, criminal record or the likelihood of the identification being correct. The operator decides if the match is valid and whether or not to contact the police. The pictures can even be passed on electronically. </p> <p>\"We don't build a database of where people are,\" says Tim Pidgeon, Visionics' business development director. He says that would breach the Data Protection Act, as it is illegal to build a database on the activities of the public. </p> <p>But business appears to be booming. Visionics has tried the system with a different watch-list - of known football hooligans - at a West Ham match against Manchester United in January last year. And other local authorities are considering the system, which costs from \u00a315,000 to scan a single camera feed and uses standard surveillance cameras. </p> <p>Some ports and airports have joined Newham. BAA told Guardian Online that unofficial trials were held at Stansted airport by a \"control authority\", but would not give further details. </p> <p>According to some, there are far better ways than face scanning to track \"suspect\" citizens. \"Number-plate recognition is far more accurate and user-friendly,\" says William Webster, a lecturer in public management at Stirling University. </p> <p>Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) arrived in the UK in 1997, when the City of London police installed cameras that scan the plates of every vehicle entering and leaving the Square Mile - a concept dubbed the ring of steel. \"The cameras are very overt. It's all very open,\" says a police spokesperson. \"We're not interested in monitoring people's movements, we just want to provide them with a safe environment.\" </p> <p>Other forces using ANPR include the Metropolitan Police, West Midlands, Thames Valley, Cumbria and Avon &amp; Somerset. Some use fixed cameras, some mobile units in vehicles, while others won't say. </p> <p>Unlike Newham's controlled watch list, ANPR checks plates against live databases: Avon &amp; Somerset's vehicle-mounted system refers to a local list, the police national computer in Hendon and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea. Data protection rules prohibit building general databases, so these systems don't retain computerised data. They simply alert police if they read a suspected vehicle's plate - although the City of London force retains the videotapes for several months. </p> <p>The traffic information provider Trafficmaster plc owns a far more widespread plate-reading system, with 8,000 cameras on trunk roads to monitor traffic speeds (its motorway cameras use a different system). The cameras, normally an eye-catching blue, cut the first two and last single digits of your plate, and transmit the remainder to Trafficmaster's headquarters in Milton Keynes. By watching for the same partial plate number further up the road, the firm gauges traffic speed. </p> <p>However, Trafficmaster says its cameras misread about one plate in four - good enough for traffic speeds, but not for criminal investigations. \"Police authorities have phoned about armed robberies, and we haven't been able to help,\" says a spokeswoman Claire Schofield. She adds that Trafficmaster's licence prohibits it from cross-referencing the number plates. Most of the incoming data is rapidly dumped, and only four or five people have access to the camera feeds, she says. </p> <p>Ian Brown, a researcher in computer security at University College, London points to an even simpler way to track citizens. \"Imagine the uproar if, five years ago, the police had suggested everyone should carry around a personal location detector at all times,\" he says. \"In five years' time, people will be accepting just this.\" </p> <p>Bringing about that change is the near ubiquitous mobile telephone. At the moment, when switched on, the units transmit their identity. Base stations within range and with capacity reply, and the phone \"handshakes\" - logs on to - one of those stations, the call strength indicator on the mobile goes up and you can make calls. </p> <p> But, as a result, your network always knows roughly where you are, if the phone is switched on. </p> <p>BT Cellnet already uses base-station data to provide relevant traffic news, and believes it is accurate to 100 metres in cities, although that accuracy falls to within 15 kilometres or more in the countryside, because of the smaller numbers of base stations. \"If we're required to give evidence for court, we are only able to say the person was within 35 kilometres,\" says John Cross, head of network security for the firm. </p> <p>That is because mobile phones will not necessarily log in to their nearest base station. Weather conditions, local topography and cell congestion mean a phone may connect to a base station further afield, he says. \"We get requests from the emergency services for greater accuracy, but we just can't do that.\" </p> <p>UCL's Brown argues that mobiles can be traced to within tens of metres in cities, by measuring its distance from three or more base stations through timing delay on signals, and using a technique called triangulation. BT Cellnet's Cross says this is possible but very difficult: digital mobile phones link to only one base station at a time, and signal distortion by weather or geography would often ruin such calculations. </p> <p>He adds that location data is retained for a few months, but only a handful of people can see it, although the network will pass the information to the police. Orange says it operates similar policies, holding location data for six months, releasing it only under a formal Data Protection Act order from law enforcers or solicitors, or by order of a court. </p> <p>That information could become more accurate. Third-generation mobile phones will increase location accuracy to within tens of metres worldwide, using satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) technology. You could find yourself getting text messages advertising shops you are passing. Meanwhile, your network will be keeping extremely accurate tabs on you. </p> <p>Banks, too, will pass on location data under order. Cash machine usage and electronic card transactions let a bank locate you - or at least your card - with precision at the time of transaction. </p> <p>As with the mobile phone networks, the location information is invisible to call-centre operators. Martin Whitehead, head of information security for Co-operative Bank, says he operates a \"need-to-know\" policy: about a dozen people have access to the exact time and location of cash-machine transactions. However, he and other bankers are concerned about the social security fraud bill going through the House of Lords. This could grant the Department of Social Security (DSS) and its local authority agents wide-ranging access to bank records. </p> <p>\"It won't include people's names, but it may have identifying data,\" says Caspar Bowden, the director of the think-tank, the Foundation for Information Policy Research. </p> <p>Whitehead says he fears the worst if the DSS gets wide access. \"We've been the subject of fishing expeditions [wide-ranging \"trawls\" for data] from the DSS and local government agents,\" he says, adding that the bank has refused access - but may not be able to under this bill. He says there should be reasonable suspicion of fraud before a customer's information is surrendered. </p> <p>The UK has the physical infrastructure for near-Orwellian surveillance, with one million cameras, several thousand number-plate readers, and the majority of the population carrying mobile phones and using transaction cards. It is only laws such as the 1984 and 1998 Data Protection Acts that stop this infrastructure being used to its full invasive capacity. </p> <p>Collecting and cross-referencing population-wide intelligence has been suggested elsewhere. Last December, the Observer uncovered a memo by Roger Gaspar, the National Criminal Intelligence Service's deputy head, saying the government should retain the details of every phone call made, every email sent, and every web-page viewed - for seven years. </p> <p>The government said it had no plans to implement this scheme. But with the political parties scuffling to appear toughest on crime, how long before such generalised, cross-referenced surveillance is mooted for the material world? </p> <p><strong> Is it easy to travel without being detected?</strong><br> Could an individual, with enemies able to access any computerised system, avoid automated detection while travelling from, say, Glasgow to London? </p> <p>First, he or she should use cash. Credit or debit cards leave a detailed electronic trail, mostly fed to central systems in real time. A mobile telephone's location is tracked, but an unregistered pre-paid mobile could solve this - as could robbery. Police think that phone theft is one of the main contributors to the recent rise in violent crime. </p> <p>Travelling south by road could be tricky. Several police forces en-route, such as Cumbria, West Midlands and the London Met, use automatic number plate recognition cameras, to check vehicles against central databases. And the fugitive may want to avoid A-roads, if suspicious that the Trafficmaster network of number plate-readers could be subverted. </p> <p>So perhaps it would be safer to take public transport: train tickets can be purchased with cash, without identification. Surveillance cameras are used at stations, but the British Transport Police, who monitor the output, says it does not employ face recognition software, and Virgin Trains says its trains do not have cameras, although new ones will. Of course, using the West Coast mainline exposes our fugitive to other risks - such as lengthy delays just outside Preston.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I have no problem travelling in a train carriage full of drones with phones, even if they are all shouting \"I've just got on the train\" to their loved ones. But I never thought I would get used to people's \"unique\" ring tones. Get a few twentysomethings with their own ring tones, and a train ride can be more like a theme tune reunion for crap 70s and 80s TV. </p> <p>On the other hand, there is be nothing more annoying than having to rifle through one's bag before realising that there are seven other people going through their pockets for phones with identical ring tones. Which is when the prospect of being the only person whose phone plays the Robin's Nest theme tune suddenly becomes more attractive. </p> <p>It appears I am not the only one either. Latest figures indicate that 64% of us own a mobile, with more keen to personalise them and internet sites only too happy to let us. Many products may be ill-suited to being sold online - just ask any of the e-tailers going bust every day - but ring tones are a booming industry, with hundreds of thousands sold every day over the internet. This figure is even more impressive given that not every mobile phone can receive and play custom-made ring tones. </p> <p>Delivered by SMS text message that the phone translates into music, it is possible that your phone can't read the SMS message in the right way. If your phone can accept ring tones as SMS messages - and Nokia owners are by far the best catered for - it is an easy transaction. All you need to give the website is your credit card number and the phone number, so it can be beamed through. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.nokia.com/phones/clubnokia.html\">Nokia</a> is so keen to expand its ring-tone business that it has signed deals with record companies such as EMI to rifle through their back catalogues in search of more tunes. The record companies are laughing as the royalty collection companies collect a fee for every tune sold by every tone retailer at <a href=\"http://www.mcps.co.uk\">www.mcps.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>Cheesy pop stars such as the Venga Boys (popular with \"the youth\") previewed their single Cheeka Bow Wow in October as a ring tone first on the <a href=\"http://www.ringtones.com\">www.ringtones.com</a> site. The ring-tone site is typical of most in that its tunes are only compatible with Nokia phones, but it also offers visual customisation of the phone, letting you buy and send pixillated works of art. </p> <p>You could also try www. tones4fones.com/ , as it offers a decent store from which to buy tunes from the past 40 years. Fancy the theme tune to the ill-fated 70s space opera Battlestar Galactica or the Ben Elton-penned Young Ones belting out of your phone next time it rings? Both can be yours for \u00a33 a pop. Or try <a href=\"http://www.boltblue.com/product/fun.htm\">www.boltblue.com/product/fun.htm</a> - a good site offering tunes, horoscopes and even jokes, all for the cost of a text message. </p> <p>Advertisers seem to have latched on to mobile phones as a badge of youth, what with the recent \"pay as you go\" ads, which had us believing that pill-happy clubbers chat about their call rates while queuing for a night's hedonism, but if you visit the ring-tone dealers, the most popular tunes are the current club classics - so they might be on to something.

      "bodyText": "I have no problem travelling in a train carriage full of drones with phones, even if they are all shouting \"I've just got on the train\" to their loved ones. But I never thought I would get used to people's \"unique\" ring tones. Get a few twentysomethings with their own ring tones, and a train ride can be more like a theme tune reunion for crap 70s and 80s TV. On the other hand, there is be nothing more annoying than having to rifle through one's bag before realising that there are seven other people going through their pockets for phones with identical ring tones. Which is when the prospect of being the only person whose phone plays the Robin's Nest theme tune suddenly becomes more attractive. It appears I am not the only one either. Latest figures indicate that 64% of us own a mobile, with more keen to personalise them and internet sites only too happy to let us. Many products may be ill-suited to being sold online - just ask any of the e-tailers going bust every day - but ring tones are a booming industry, with hundreds of thousands sold every day over the internet. This figure is even more impressive given that not every mobile phone can receive and play custom-made ring tones. Delivered by SMS text message that the phone translates into music, it is possible that your phone can't read the SMS message in the right way. If your phone can accept ring tones as SMS messages - and Nokia owners are by far the best catered for - it is an easy transaction. All you need to give the website is your credit card number and the phone number, so it can be beamed through. Nokia is so keen to expand its ring-tone business that it has signed deals with record companies such as EMI to rifle through their back catalogues in search of more tunes. The record companies are laughing as the royalty collection companies collect a fee for every tune sold by every tone retailer at www.mcps.co.uk. Cheesy pop stars such as the Venga Boys (popular with \"the youth\") previewed their single Cheeka Bow Wow in October as a ring tone first on the www.ringtones.com site. The ring-tone site is typical of most in that its tunes are only compatible with Nokia phones, but it also offers visual customisation of the phone, letting you buy and send pixillated works of art. You could also try www. tones4fones.com/ , as it offers a decent store from which to buy tunes from the past 40 years. Fancy the theme tune to the ill-fated 70s space opera Battlestar Galactica or the Ben Elton-penned Young Ones belting out of your phone next time it rings? Both can be yours for \u00a33 a pop. Or try www.boltblue.com/product/fun.htm - a good site offering tunes, horoscopes and even jokes, all for the cost of a text message. Advertisers seem to have latched on to mobile phones as a badge of youth, what with the recent \"pay as you go\" ads, which had us believing that pill-happy clubbers chat about their call rates while queuing for a night's hedonism, but if you visit the ring-tone dealers, the most popular tunes are the current club classics - so they might be on to something. If you want your finger (and phone) firmly on the pulsing nub of youth, try www.ministryofsound.com/music/ring_tones . The South London superclub lets you download the latest tunes. These repetitive, beat-based ditties are not even in the charts yet and you can snap up five dancefloor monsters for a tenner if you're quick.

But the small British company that pioneered handheld computing in the early 1980s will not have the market to itself. The competition includes almost every major player in the cellular phone market, plus a raft of handheld computer manufacturers with systems based on Palm's operating system and Microsoft's PocketPC. </p> <p>Indeed, a small company based in Birmingham may already have stolen Psion's thunder. While many systems were shown at the recent GSM World 2001 mobile phone conference in Cannes, the one that attracted most attention was Sendo's featherweight multimedia phone. </p> <p>Psion is being put under pressure by the success of Palm and Handspring in the market for PDAs (personal digital assistants), and this may show in the financial results it is also due to reveal today. </p> <p>Palm is not complaining. On Monday, International Data Corporation, a US-based research company, said it expected sales of \"smart handheld devices\" to grow from 12.9 million units last year to more than 63.4 million by 2004. </p> <p>But the bottom end of the computer market, made up of handheld devices, is converging with the top end of the phone market. The future may belong to merged PDA-phones. However, the battle for supremacy will be bitter, and may never be won. </p> <p>Two years ago, it looked as though the market would go to Psion's Epoc operating system, which it spun off into a separate company called Symbian. Its backers included the West's phone giants, Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola. At least seven companies are thought to be building smart phones using Symbian's software. </p> <p>The first Symbian-based smart phone, the Ericsson R380, went on sale late last year, and Nokia is expected to deliver the Communicator 9210, with a colour screen, in the next few weeks. </p> <p>Today, however, victory for Symbian looks less certain. Handspring, founded by the people who started Palm Inc, has made a run with its VisorPhone, soon to be available in the UK. It is basically a Palm-based computer combined with a GSM phone module. Thus it should appeal to European Palm users who cannot buy Palm VII wireless handhelds. Nokia, Korea's Samsung and Japan's Kyocera are also expected to launch Palm-based phones. </p> <p>Then there is the two-pronged attack based on Microsoft's PocketPC version of Windows CE. First, there are VisorPhone-style devices created by adding GSM modules to handhelds. </p> <p>Next, there will be smart phones based on a smaller and more efficient version of the PocketPC software. </p> <p>But the battle may not be decided on the merits of the hardware and software. For while the technology used by PDAs and smart phones is converging, they are usually sold on a different basis. </p> <p>PDA buyers have to pay the full whack for their systems which can be more expensive than desktop PCs. Most phone buyers, by contrast, expect to pay little for their handsets, with the real cost covered by call charges. </p> <p>So the real question will not be which \u00a3500 devices perform best, but which ones the network operators and their retailers knock out for \u00a399.99 or less. </p>",

On Monday, International Data Corporation, a US-based research company, said it expected sales of \"smart handheld devices\" to grow from 12.9 million units last year to more than 63.4 million by 2004. But the bottom end of the computer market, made up of handheld devices, is converging with the top end of the phone market. The future may belong to merged PDA-phones. However, the battle for supremacy will be bitter, and may never be won. Two years ago, it looked as though the market would go to Psion's Epoc operating system, which it spun off into a separate company called Symbian. Its backers included the West's phone giants, Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola. At least seven companies are thought to be building smart phones using Symbian's software. The first Symbian-based smart phone, the Ericsson R380, went on sale late last year, and Nokia is expected to deliver the Communicator 9210, with a colour screen, in the next few weeks. Today, however, victory for Symbian looks less certain. Handspring, founded by the people who started Palm Inc, has made a run with its VisorPhone, soon to be available in the UK. It is basically a Palm-based computer combined with a GSM phone module. Thus it should appeal to European Palm users who cannot buy Palm VII wireless handhelds. Nokia, Korea's Samsung and Japan's Kyocera are also expected to launch Palm-based phones. Then there is the two-pronged attack based on Microsoft's PocketPC version of Windows CE. First, there are VisorPhone-style devices created by adding GSM modules to handhelds. Next, there will be smart phones based on a smaller and more efficient version of the PocketPC software. But the battle may not be decided on the merits of the hardware and software. For while the technology used by PDAs and smart phones is converging, they are usually sold on a different basis. PDA buyers have to pay the full whack for their systems which can be more expensive than desktop PCs. Most phone buyers, by contrast, expect to pay little for their handsets, with the real cost covered by call charges. So the real question will not be which \u00a3500 devices perform best, but which ones the network operators and their retailers knock out for \u00a399.99 or less.",

      "bodyText": "Seattle was hit by an earthquake which registered 7.0 on the Richter scale yesterday and sent thousands in the city centre scurrying into the streets from evacuated office buildings. The earthquake was felt 700 miles away in Salt Lake City, Utah. Twelve people were reported injured, three of them seriously. A technology conference being addressed by Bill Gates came to an abrupt halt when the 15-second earthquake struck in mid-morning. The epicentre was just to the south of the city's centre. The earthquake came as research after the devastating earthquake in India last month suggested that the \"blind thrust\" faults which levelled parts of Gujarat and run beneath central Los Angeles could produce earthquakes of the same magnitude. The earthquake that caused nearly 20,000 fatalities in India on January 26 registered 7.7 on the scale. It had been assumed that the blind thrust faults in southern California were not capable of producing earthquakes of greater than 7.3 magnitude. But this week the research team who monitor earthquake potential for the state said that they would have to revise their estimates to 7.7 after the Indian earthquake. An increase of 0.4 magnitude at that point on the Richter scale would produce an earthquake with 2.5 times more energy. Researchers in California now believe that there is a 70% probability of a major earthquake in San Francisco's Bay Area within the next 30 years. The earthquake that killed 67 people and caused $7bn (about \u00a34.9bn) in damage in the San Francisco Bay area in 1989 registered 7.1 on the scale. The Northridge quake centred in a Los Angeles suburb in 1994, which killed 60 and was linked to a blind thrust fault near Los Angeles, registered 6.7. \"[Gujarat] sort of raises the bar for what the maximum earthquake-detection threshold is for blind thrust faults,\" said William Lettis, an earthquake hazard consultant and a member of the research team sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute. \"As a geologist, can you go out and easily find a fault that will produce a future 7.7 earthquake?\" he said. \"The answer is no, and that's an important lesson.\" The new earthquake and the findings come only days after the Bay Area experienced a smaller tremor registering 4.4 and centred 11 miles to the east of San Jose in Silicon Valley, which was also felt in Marin county. The effects of that earthquake were felt for around five minutes. While Californians are used to minor earthquakes - they all have their own earthquake experience story - the new findings indicate that if the \"Big One\" does come it could be even more serious than expected. Thrust faults tend to be particularly damaging to tall buildings, because they accelerate vertically. Earthquakes along another type of fault, known as a strike-clip fault, move horizontally. The San Andreas fault is of the latter type. As people increasingly migrate into earthquake zones, particularly ones near the coast, scientists suggest that a big earthquake could claim as many as 1m victims this century - about as many as have died from earthquakes in the past 100 years. The Global Earthquake Response Centre does have some comfort for Californians, however. On its website it asks: \"Could a powerful enough earthquake cause California to break off and fall into the ocean?\" The reply is: \"No. It's a common misconception.\"",

      "byline": "Brian Glanville",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Stan Cullis, who has died aged 84, managed Wolverhampton Wanderers during the club's European glory days in the 1950s and steered them to three League titles. He was also one of the finest centre-halves of his day and a former England captain.</p> <p>Cullis was born in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, but his father was a Wolverhampton man, and Wolves could thank Cullis senior for the fact that Stanley went to Molineux. Several major clubs had shown interest in him when he was playing as a teenager for the Ellesmere Port team, but his father, wanting to get him to Wolves, wrote to recommend him. They signed him up in 1934, after a trial. He became skipper of the A team at 17, the reserves at 18 and the first team by the time he was 19. An especially notable month for him was May 1939, when, in Bucharest, against Romania, he was made captain of the England team, the youngest ever at the age of 22. England won 2-0.</p> <p>The Wolves team were known as the Buckley Babes, after their flamboyant manager, Major Frank Buckley. His emphasis was very much on youth. He had fielded the 16-year-old outside-left, Jimmy Mullen, later to become an English international of renown, in the FA Cup semi-final of 1939. The team, moreover, were supposed to derive their pace and energy from monkey glands, though this may be the stuff of legend.</p> <p>At all events, they were red-hot favourites to win the final at Wembley, against a seemingly workaday Portsmouth team. But when the book which players of each team were expected to sign before the game was brought from the Wolves dressing-room into Portsmouth's, the Pompey players suddenly decided they were on to a good thing. So nervous were the Wolves team that their signatures were shaky and illegible. Portsmouth won at a canter, 4-1.</p> <p>Salt may have been rubbed into Cullis's wounds by the fact that following tradition, Madame Tussaud's waxwork display featured models of the two captains shaking hands before the game; Cullis himself, and Portsmouth's Jimmy Guthrie. Usually, those models would be in place for only a year. But since \"official\" football was abandoned in 1939, Cullis and Guthrie remained their waxwork selves till after the FA Cup Final of 1946.</p> <p>In the era of the third back game and the stopper centre-half, Cullis was sometimes misnamed an attacking centre-half; a figure which had long disappeared from British football. But he was certainly what you might call a footballing centre-half. Though strong in the tackle and capable in the air, he was skilful and composed on the ball. The sight of him coolly holding off the challenge of several Scottish forwards when playing for England at Wembley on a snow-covered pitch in January 1942 was one not easily forgotten.</p> <p>He was, perhaps, polished rather than elegant. His arms-akimbo style led his fellow England players to nickname him Flipper. But he had their deep respect, not least throughout the war, when he was the centre of a famous half-back line, with the two Everton players Cliff Britton and Joe Mercer on either side of him. His use of the ball, besides, was always shrewd. All three players, like so many professional footballers, were drafted into the Army Physical Training Corps. This meant being based at Aldershot, and the little local Third Division football club was thus able to field the England half-back line in its entirety as \"guest\" players.</p> <p>Cullis, who never lost his Black Country accent, would have won infinitely more than his 12 international caps had wartime internationals been officially recognised. As it was, he did have the satisfaction of playing in one of England's most triumphant pre-war games, when they thrashed the German team 6-3 in May 1938 in the Olympic Stadium, Berlin, after being obliged to give the Nazi salute.</p> <p>Eddie Hapgood of Arsenal, a celebrated captain of England himself, picked Cullis in his best-ever team, calling him \"an intelligent, defensive centre-half who varied his play by attacking when the situation warranted this method. Stanley has mannerisms which sometimes annoy onlookers, but nothing ruffles him. He goes his own way, thoughtfully, always looking for the opportunity of a crack down the middle.\"</p> <p>Hapgood also told the tale of how Cullis surprised the other England players on tour in Europe, after they had been teasing him about his study of foreign languages. Always a great one for self-improvement, a night-school man, Cullis was known to have applied himself to Esperanto; and to French. An England player who had been foremost in the taunting challenged Cullis to ask a Frenchman for directions. Far from being discomfited, Cullis conversed with the man in fluent French.</p> <p>His playing career came to a disappointingly early end, for those who admired him. Serving with the army in Europe, he inevitably lost fitness and returned early in 1946 for an embarrassing game for Wolves against Arsenal at Tottenham, so short of pace that he was most untypically reduced to grabbing his opposing centre-forward, Reg Lewis, by the shirt, to the scorn of the crowd.</p> <p>He recovered form to captain Wolves with flair and authority in the first post-war official season, which began with a shattering 6-1 win against Arsenal. Wolves seemed odds on for the Championship, but an appalling winter with its endless cancellations extended the season well into the summer. Wolves faltered on the harder going, and lost their last match at home to Liverpool - and with it lost the title to their opponents.</p> <p>So, at only 31, and after 152 League games for Wolves, Cullis retired to become assistant manager, then, in 1948, manager itself. He would prove a highly motivated and successful one, though his tactics did not endear him and his team to everyone. He proved a powerful, authoritarian figure. Most of his players would have died for him, but there were those, youngsters especially, who later complained that he had treated them harshly.</p> <p>Wolves' methods were deeply influenced by the theories of Charles Reep, a retired RAF wing commander, who had worked as an accountant. In those pre-computer days, Reep's elaborate theories of match analysis were expounded in the old News Chronicle in an infinity of squiggly diagrams. The essence of the theory was that the ball should be propelled into the danger zones as quickly as possible, ideally with long passes. So the premium was on pace and power, rather than ball-play and an elaborate build-up.</p> <p>\"Flying wingers\" were the essence of Wolves' game, and Cullis had them par excellence in the now mature Jimmy Mullen, on the left, and little Johnny Hancocks, bought cheaply from nearby Walsall, on the right. They poured their centres into the penalty box where such attackers as Jesse Pye, bought from Notts County as an inside-right but converted to centre-forward, exploited them with foot or head.</p> <p>Sitting in the press box in front of Cullis, when he himself was above in the directors' box - managers didn't then shout and scream from the dug out - could be a revealing experience. \"Tip-tap, tip-tap,\" he would acidly say when the passes weren't long enough for him. \"Here it comes, the classical stuff!\" And, when a throw-in went wrong, \"That's Clamp's classical throw-in, see?\" To be followed by a satisfied, \"Thump-thump, thump-thump!\" when the long balls started going in.</p> <p>However controversial the style, there was no doubt about the consistent success. And the superb individual goal which the red-haired Irish international inside- forward Sammy Smyth scored for Wolves when they beat Leicester 3-1 in the 1949 Cup Final at Wembley would have graced any team.</p> <p>Cullis had the ideal adjutant in his, and England's captain, Billy Wright, a blond wing-half of boyish enthusiasm, who later in his career became a fine centre-half and was always, like Cullis himself, a Wolves player.</p> <p>Famous floodlit victories were won at Molineux against Hungary's then formidable Honved (3-2), despite the presence of six of the Hungarians who had humbled England at Wembley; Moscow Dynamo (2-1) and Moscow Spartak (4-0).

      "bodyText": "Stan Cullis, who has died aged 84, managed Wolverhampton Wanderers during the club's European glory days in the 1950s and steered them to three League titles. He was also one of the finest centre-halves of his day and a former England captain. Cullis was born in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, but his father was a Wolverhampton man, and Wolves could thank Cullis senior for the fact that Stanley went to Molineux. Several major clubs had shown interest in him when he was playing as a teenager for the Ellesmere Port team, but his father, wanting to get him to Wolves, wrote to recommend him. They signed him up in 1934, after a trial. He became skipper of the A team at 17, the reserves at 18 and the first team by the time he was 19. An especially notable month for him was May 1939, when, in Bucharest, against Romania, he was made captain of the England team, the youngest ever at the age of 22. England won 2-0. The Wolves team were known as the Buckley Babes, after their flamboyant manager, Major Frank Buckley. His emphasis was very much on youth. He had fielded the 16-year-old outside-left, Jimmy Mullen, later to become an English international of renown, in the FA Cup semi-final of 1939. The team, moreover, were supposed to derive their pace and energy from monkey glands, though this may be the stuff of legend. At all events, they were red-hot favourites to win the final at Wembley, against a seemingly workaday Portsmouth team. But when the book which players of each team were expected to sign before the game was brought from the Wolves dressing-room into Portsmouth's, the Pompey players suddenly decided they were on to a good thing. So nervous were the Wolves team that their signatures were shaky and illegible. Portsmouth won at a canter, 4-1. Salt may have been rubbed into Cullis's wounds by the fact that following tradition, Madame Tussaud's waxwork display featured models of the two captains shaking hands before the game; Cullis himself, and Portsmouth's Jimmy Guthrie. Usually, those models would be in place for only a year. But since \"official\" football was abandoned in 1939, Cullis and Guthrie remained their waxwork selves till after the FA Cup Final of 1946. In the era of the third back game and the stopper centre-half, Cullis was sometimes misnamed an attacking centre-half; a figure which had long disappeared from British football. But he was certainly what you might call a footballing centre-half. Though strong in the tackle and capable in the air, he was skilful and composed on the ball. The sight of him coolly holding off the challenge of several Scottish forwards when playing for England at Wembley on a snow-covered pitch in January 1942 was one not easily forgotten. He was, perhaps, polished rather than elegant. His arms-akimbo style led his fellow England players to nickname him Flipper. But he had their deep respect, not least throughout the war, when he was the centre of a famous half-back line, with the two Everton players Cliff Britton and Joe Mercer on either side of him. His use of the ball, besides, was always shrewd. All three players, like so many professional footballers, were drafted into the Army Physical Training Corps. This meant being based at Aldershot, and the little local Third Division football club was thus able to field the England half-back line in its entirety as \"guest\" players. Cullis, who never lost his Black Country accent, would have won infinitely more than his 12 international caps had wartime internationals been officially recognised. As it was, he did have the satisfaction of playing in one of England's most triumphant pre-war games, when they thrashed the German team 6-3 in May 1938 in the Olympic Stadium, Berlin, after being obliged to give the Nazi salute. Eddie Hapgood of Arsenal, a celebrated captain of England himself, picked Cullis in his best-ever team, calling him \"an intelligent, defensive centre-half who varied his play by attacking when the situation warranted this method. Stanley has mannerisms which sometimes annoy onlookers, but nothing ruffles him. He goes his own way, thoughtfully, always looking for the opportunity of a crack down the middle.\" Hapgood also told the tale of how Cullis surprised the other England players on tour in Europe, after they had been teasing him about his study of foreign languages. Always a great one for self-improvement, a night-school man, Cullis was known to have applied himself to Esperanto; and to French. An England player who had been foremost in the taunting challenged Cullis to ask a Frenchman for directions. Far from being discomfited, Cullis conversed with the man in fluent French. His playing career came to a disappointingly early end, for those who admired him. Serving with the army in Europe, he inevitably lost fitness and returned early in 1946 for an embarrassing game for Wolves against Arsenal at Tottenham, so short of pace that he was most untypically reduced to grabbing his opposing centre-forward, Reg Lewis, by the shirt, to the scorn of the crowd. He recovered form to captain Wolves with flair and authority in the first post-war official season, which began with a shattering 6-1 win against Arsenal. Wolves seemed odds on for the Championship, but an appalling winter with its endless cancellations extended the season well into the summer. Wolves faltered on the harder going, and lost their last match at home to Liverpool - and with it lost the title to their opponents. So, at only 31, and after 152 League games for Wolves, Cullis retired to become assistant manager, then, in 1948, manager itself. He would prove a highly motivated and successful one, though his tactics did not endear him and his team to everyone. He proved a powerful, authoritarian figure. Most of his players would have died for him, but there were those, youngsters especially, who later complained that he had treated them harshly. Wolves' methods were deeply influenced by the theories of Charles Reep, a retired RAF wing commander, who had worked as an accountant. In those pre-computer days, Reep's elaborate theories of match analysis were expounded in the old News Chronicle in an infinity of squiggly diagrams. The essence of the theory was that the ball should be propelled into the danger zones as quickly as possible, ideally with long passes. So the premium was on pace and power, rather than ball-play and an elaborate build-up. \"Flying wingers\" were the essence of Wolves' game, and Cullis had them par excellence in the now mature Jimmy Mullen, on the left, and little Johnny Hancocks, bought cheaply from nearby Walsall, on the right. They poured their centres into the penalty box where such attackers as Jesse Pye, bought from Notts County as an inside-right but converted to centre-forward, exploited them with foot or head. Sitting in the press box in front of Cullis, when he himself was above in the directors' box - managers didn't then shout and scream from the dug out - could be a revealing experience. \"Tip-tap, tip-tap,\" he would acidly say when the passes weren't long enough for him. \"Here it comes, the classical stuff!\" And, when a throw-in went wrong, \"That's Clamp's classical throw-in, see?\" To be followed by a satisfied, \"Thump-thump, thump-thump!\" when the long balls started going in. However controversial the style, there was no doubt about the consistent success. And the superb individual goal which the red-haired Irish international inside- forward Sammy Smyth scored for Wolves when they beat Leicester 3-1 in the 1949 Cup Final at Wembley would have graced any team. Cullis had the ideal adjutant in his, and England's captain, Billy Wright, a blond wing-half of boyish enthusiasm, who later in his career became a fine centre-half and was always, like Cullis himself, a Wolves player. Famous floodlit victories were won at Molineux against Hungary's then formidable Honved (3-2), despite the presence of six of the Hungarians who had humbled England at Wembley; Moscow Dynamo (2-1) and Moscow Spartak (4-0). Wolves won the League championship in 1954, 1958 and 1959, finished runners-up in 1950, 1955 and 1960, and came third in 1953 and 1956. They also lifted the FA Cup in 1949 and in 1960, though Blackburn, their victims, were reduced to 10 men. In the dressing room afterwards one saw the humorous side of Cullis, lamenting that the cup was a nuisance: \"You have to take it to this flopping fete and that flopping fete.\" He never swore. In Europe, however, Wolves' style was much less effective and there were two memorable thrashings - by a polyglot Barcelona, notably in the mud of Molineux, when five goals were conceded. Wolves slid away in those early 60s, living in the shadow of Manchester United and Matt Busby. In September 1964 they dropped the pilot. Cullis was rather shabbily dismissed, and Wolves have never really been the same since. After vowing not to return to football and spurning a big offer from Juventus, Cullis re-emerged as manager of Birmingham City a year later, but somehow the virtue seemed to have gone out of him and he could not conjure up the same success. After leaving Birmingham in 1970, he worked in a photography business. In 1992, Wolves and Aston Villa played a testimonial match for him, and there are plans for a statue outside Molineux. His wife Winifred predeceased him, and he is survived by his son, Andrew, who became a vicar, and daughter, Susan.

      "body": "<p>Sir Charles Fletcher-Cooke QC, the Tory MP for Darwen, Lancashire, from 1951-83, and Home Office minister from 1961-63, who has died aged 86, was both whimsical and highly intelligent. He will probably be remembered for the press photograph of him looking like a frightened gargoyle taken in the wake of the incident that ended his promising ministerial career. Homosexuality was then still a prison offence. The press pack had been alerted that the police had arrested his handsome 18-year-old friend Andrew Turner, a delinquent with three convictions, driving Fletcher-Cooke's Austin Princess without a driving licence or insurance.</p> <p>He resigned his ministerial office on the pretence that he had only been \"misguided\" in trying to help Turner. Fletcher-Cooke continued to serve Darwen, and its troubled textile industry, until its boundaries changed in 1983.</p> <p>A number of his fellow Tories had it in for him, because he could not control his barrister's trick of scoring off the less clever. Some right-wingers, like Sir Cyril Osborne, did not forgive his left-of-centre \"one nation\", pro-European approach, attributing it to his early political beginnings as a Labour candidate in 1945 in East Dorset, which he missed winning by only 1,500 votes. The Sunday Express was fond of quoting his statements from the time, like \"Ethically and practically, socialism is indisputably correct and its application by a Labour government will produce order and beauty\"</p> <p>He was born into a professional London family, impoverished because his father had died from his Gallipoli wounds.

      "bodyText": "Sir Charles Fletcher-Cooke QC, the Tory MP for Darwen, Lancashire, from 1951-83, and Home Office minister from 1961-63, who has died aged 86, was both whimsical and highly intelligent. He will probably be remembered for the press photograph of him looking like a frightened gargoyle taken in the wake of the incident that ended his promising ministerial career. Homosexuality was then still a prison offence. The press pack had been alerted that the police had arrested his handsome 18-year-old friend Andrew Turner, a delinquent with three convictions, driving Fletcher-Cooke's Austin Princess without a driving licence or insurance. He resigned his ministerial office on the pretence that he had only been \"misguided\" in trying to help Turner. Fletcher-Cooke continued to serve Darwen, and its troubled textile industry, until its boundaries changed in 1983. A number of his fellow Tories had it in for him, because he could not control his barrister's trick of scoring off the less clever. Some right-wingers, like Sir Cyril Osborne, did not forgive his left-of-centre \"one nation\", pro-European approach, attributing it to his early political beginnings as a Labour candidate in 1945 in East Dorset, which he missed winning by only 1,500 votes. The Sunday Express was fond of quoting his statements from the time, like \"Ethically and practically, socialism is indisputably correct and its application by a Labour government will produce order and beauty\" He was born into a professional London family, impoverished because his father had died from his Gallipoli wounds. Both he and his older brother John held scholarships at Malvern College. A further scholarship took him to Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he was both editor of Granta and president of the Union in 1936, emerging with a first. In 1938, he qualified for the Bar, winning first-class honours, and began as a Chancery barrister. With MJ Albery, he produced a textbook on monopolies and restrictive practices.

They run far below the surface rock. </p> <p>In the case of California's San Andreas fault, they threaten the plains that lie to the west. </p> <p>The 1994 earthquake in the Los Angeles suburb of Northridge awakened the area to the fact that it was 10 miles above this hazard. </p> <p>Great segments of rock strata had suddenly ridden one over the other, creating shockwaves but leaving no evidence on the surface that anything much had happened. </p> <p>Since January 1994 the Granada Hills around Northridge have risen by 15cm, researchers say: in effect, the quake is quietly continuing. </p> <p>Another blind thrust fault runs almost 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles to the Coyote Hills in northern Orange county. It has yet to show what it can do. </p> <p>Just a few days ago the San Francisco area felt a small tremor registering 4.4 and centred 11 miles to the east of San Jose in Silicon Valley. The effects were felt for around five minutes. </p> <p>While Californians are used to minor earthquakes - they all have their own earthquake experience story - the new findings indicate that if the \"Big One\" does come it could be even more serious than expected. </p> <p>Thrust faults tend to be particularly damaging to tall buildings, because they accelerate vertically.</p>",

The 1994 quake centred in a Los Angeles suburb, Northridge, which killed 60 and was linked to a blind thrust fault near Los Angeles, registered 6.7. \"[Gujarat] sort of raises the bar for what the maximum earthquake-detection threshold is for blind thrust faults,\" said William Lettis, an earthquake hazard consultant and a member of the research team, which is sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute. Blind thrust faults are smaller faults created over time along main faultlines. They run far below the surface rock. In the case of California's San Andreas fault, they threaten the plains that lie to the west. The 1994 earthquake in the Los Angeles suburb of Northridge awakened the area to the fact that it was 10 miles above this hazard. Great segments of rock strata had suddenly ridden one over the other, creating shockwaves but leaving no evidence on the surface that anything much had happened. Since January 1994 the Granada Hills around Northridge have risen by 15cm, researchers say: in effect, the quake is quietly continuing. Another blind thrust fault runs almost 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles to the Coyote Hills in northern Orange county. It has yet to show what it can do. Just a few days ago the San Francisco area felt a small tremor registering 4.4 and centred 11 miles to the east of San Jose in Silicon Valley. The effects were felt for around five minutes. While Californians are used to minor earthquakes - they all have their own earthquake experience story - the new findings indicate that if the \"Big One\" does come it could be even more serious than expected. Thrust faults tend to be particularly damaging to tall buildings, because they accelerate vertically.",

      "body": "<p>Two years ago, the name Fabiola Arredondo was unknown. Today, she will be named as the most influential businesswoman in Europe. The Spanish-American thirtysomething heads a list of 30 women regarded as the most inspirational female business figures. </p> <p>The top 30 was assembled by a panel of business professors for the Wall Street Journal Europe. They assessed nearly 150 women executives in Europe, ranking each in terms of influence in their industries and in European business. </p> <p>Ms Arredondo ousted Marjorie Scardino, the Texan-born chief executive of the Pearson media empire and still the only female chief of a FTSE 100 company. </p> <p>In fashion, the top ranked woman is Donatella Versace, just ahead of Miuccia Prada. Elisabeth Murdoch and Marina Berlusconi - daughters of two of the world's biggest media moguls, also make the list, along with Marianne Nivert, the president and chief executive of Telia, Sweden's equivalent of BT, and Anne Lauvergeon, the chief executive of French nuclear reprocessing and recycling group Cogema. </p> <p>Julie Meyer and Martha Lane Fox -along with Ms Arredondo - are the female face of the dot.com business world. The photogenic Ms Meyer founded networking group First Tuesday. </p> <p>Computers have generated two of the top 30 - Olga Dergunova, the boss of Microsoft Russia and Isabel Aguillera, director-general of Dell Spain. The male-dominated world of motor manufacturing has produced two more - Ford's Barbara Kux and Citroen's Magda Salarich. </p> <p> <strong>Top five</strong></p> <p>1 <strong>Fabiola Arredondo </strong>Former head of Yahoo!'s European arm</p> <p>At first glance Fabiola Arredondo seems an unlikely candidate for holder of the title of Europe's most influential businesswoman. </p> <p>But for those who know her, the recognition is just another step in the seemingly relentless rise of the woman who has come to symbolise a new breed of dot.com wunderkinds. </p> <p>American-born to Spanish parents, Ms Arredondo has shattered in spectacular fashion the glass ceiling that stops women from reaching the top of corporate life. </p> <p>Until last month she was head of the European operations of <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">Yahoo!</a>, the huge US internet portal. Appointed in 1997 to what was then a 13-person outfit, she has turned it into a multi-country operation with 500 employees and a revenue of \u00a379m. </p> <p>The success led to flatter ing cover stories in Newsweek, appearances on Question Time and a position as a government adviser on the future of media and communications. </p> <p>Today she is expected to outline for the first time the secret \"private business interests\" that prompted her to quit Yahoo!. </p> <p>Ms Arredondo, the wife of Pret A Manger sandwich chain chief executive Andrew Rolfe, arrived in the UK armed for success, having completed her education at Stanford and Harvard universities and speaking five languages. </p> <p>She had got a taste of Wall Street with investment bank JP Morgan and worked in the media industry with BMG, the record label owned by German communications group Bertelsmann. BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC, managed to snaffle her as distribution director until her eye was caught by the internet. </p> <p>But friends say she left as she found working for a public service-owned organisation frustrating. Her new venture is likely to see her in total control. Her star is in the ascendancy again. John Cassy</p> <p> 2 <strong>Marjorie Scardino </strong>From shrimp farming to 'first lady'</p> <p>Marjorie Scardino has come a long way from running a shrimp farming business in the deep south of the US. In the four years since becoming chief executive of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and Penguin Books, she has become used to the title of the \"first lady of the Footsie\". </p> <p>She has had to. As the only woman chief executive in the FTSE 100, Ms Scardino has no competition. She is also part of another trend - that of hiring managers from overseas to run British companies from Marks &amp; Spencer to Barclays and BA. </p> <p>After an initially lukewarm reception from the City, the Texan-born executive has built unflagging support in the Square Mile. She turned Pearson from a rambling collection of assets to a focused media business, selling broker Lazards, Madame Tussaud's and Mindscape, the CD-rom maker. The disposals, she once said, were so obvious \"even a blind monkey could have done them\". </p> <p>In their place she has bet on the online education market with a series of US acquisitions. </p> <p>Pearson's television assets were merged last year with those of CLT-Ufa in RTL, Europe's largest TV and radio group. She is also a director of America Online. </p> <p>Ms Scardino, 53, who retains a southern lilt, entered the media when she launched a Pulitzer Prize-winning Savannah newspaper with her journalist husband Albert. Despite critical acclaim, the paper was not a commercial success. She joined the US edition of the Economist, in which Pearson had a stake, eventually becoming chief executive and trebling circulation. </p> <p>Ms Scardino has since performed the same trick with Pearson's valuation, nearly trebling it to \u00a312bn. </p> <p>A glowing profile in the Atlanta Journal noted that she now lives in \"Knightsbridge, an elite London neighbourhood, and socialises with English nobility\". David Teather</p> <p> 3 <strong>Clara Furse </strong>Accepting LSE, the 'poisoned chalice'</p> <p>Clara Furse has leaped spectacularly into the limelight this year with her new job as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. The 43-year-old mother of three is the first woman to hold the post and was a surprise choice for the job, which many regard as a poisoned chalice. </p> <p>But she came with a track record that may make her an ideal choice to restructure the organisation that not so long ago operated like a gentleman's club but which now needs to be a tough, hi-tech commercial business. </p> <p>She may favour chic little suits in baby blue and pastel pink, but Ms Furse is regarded as a woman with an iron fist and a steel will. </p> <p>Her background is in the complex world of derivatives.

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, the name Fabiola Arredondo was unknown. Today, she will be named as the most influential businesswoman in Europe. The Spanish-American thirtysomething heads a list of 30 women regarded as the most inspirational female business figures. The top 30 was assembled by a panel of business professors for the Wall Street Journal Europe. They assessed nearly 150 women executives in Europe, ranking each in terms of influence in their industries and in European business. Ms Arredondo ousted Marjorie Scardino, the Texan-born chief executive of the Pearson media empire and still the only female chief of a FTSE 100 company. In fashion, the top ranked woman is Donatella Versace, just ahead of Miuccia Prada. Elisabeth Murdoch and Marina Berlusconi - daughters of two of the world's biggest media moguls, also make the list, along with Marianne Nivert, the president and chief executive of Telia, Sweden's equivalent of BT, and Anne Lauvergeon, the chief executive of French nuclear reprocessing and recycling group Cogema. Julie Meyer and Martha Lane Fox -along with Ms Arredondo - are the female face of the dot.com business world. The photogenic Ms Meyer founded networking group First Tuesday. Computers have generated two of the top 30 - Olga Dergunova, the boss of Microsoft Russia and Isabel Aguillera, director-general of Dell Spain. The male-dominated world of motor manufacturing has produced two more - Ford's Barbara Kux and Citroen's Magda Salarich. Top five 1 Fabiola Arredondo Former head of Yahoo!'s European arm At first glance Fabiola Arredondo seems an unlikely candidate for holder of the title of Europe's most influential businesswoman. But for those who know her, the recognition is just another step in the seemingly relentless rise of the woman who has come to symbolise a new breed of dot.com wunderkinds. American-born to Spanish parents, Ms Arredondo has shattered in spectacular fashion the glass ceiling that stops women from reaching the top of corporate life. Until last month she was head of the European operations of Yahoo!, the huge US internet portal. Appointed in 1997 to what was then a 13-person outfit, she has turned it into a multi-country operation with 500 employees and a revenue of \u00a379m. The success led to flatter ing cover stories in Newsweek, appearances on Question Time and a position as a government adviser on the future of media and communications. Today she is expected to outline for the first time the secret \"private business interests\" that prompted her to quit Yahoo!. Ms Arredondo, the wife of Pret A Manger sandwich chain chief executive Andrew Rolfe, arrived in the UK armed for success, having completed her education at Stanford and Harvard universities and speaking five languages. She had got a taste of Wall Street with investment bank JP Morgan and worked in the media industry with BMG, the record label owned by German communications group Bertelsmann. BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC, managed to snaffle her as distribution director until her eye was caught by the internet. But friends say she left as she found working for a public service-owned organisation frustrating. Her new venture is likely to see her in total control. Her star is in the ascendancy again. John Cassy 2 Marjorie Scardino From shrimp farming to 'first lady' Marjorie Scardino has come a long way from running a shrimp farming business in the deep south of the US. In the four years since becoming chief executive of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and Penguin Books, she has become used to the title of the \"first lady of the Footsie\". She has had to. As the only woman chief executive in the FTSE 100, Ms Scardino has no competition. She is also part of another trend - that of hiring managers from overseas to run British companies from Marks &amp; Spencer to Barclays and BA. After an initially lukewarm reception from the City, the Texan-born executive has built unflagging support in the Square Mile. She turned Pearson from a rambling collection of assets to a focused media business, selling broker Lazards, Madame Tussaud's and Mindscape, the CD-rom maker. The disposals, she once said, were so obvious \"even a blind monkey could have done them\". In their place she has bet on the online education market with a series of US acquisitions. Pearson's television assets were merged last year with those of CLT-Ufa in RTL, Europe's largest TV and radio group. She is also a director of America Online. Ms Scardino, 53, who retains a southern lilt, entered the media when she launched a Pulitzer Prize-winning Savannah newspaper with her journalist husband Albert. Despite critical acclaim, the paper was not a commercial success. She joined the US edition of the Economist, in which Pearson had a stake, eventually becoming chief executive and trebling circulation. Ms Scardino has since performed the same trick with Pearson's valuation, nearly trebling it to \u00a312bn. A glowing profile in the Atlanta Journal noted that she now lives in \"Knightsbridge, an elite London neighbourhood, and socialises with English nobility\". David Teather 3 Clara Furse Accepting LSE, the 'poisoned chalice' Clara Furse has leaped spectacularly into the limelight this year with her new job as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. The 43-year-old mother of three is the first woman to hold the post and was a surprise choice for the job, which many regard as a poisoned chalice. But she came with a track record that may make her an ideal choice to restructure the organisation that not so long ago operated like a gentleman's club but which now needs to be a tough, hi-tech commercial business. She may favour chic little suits in baby blue and pastel pink, but Ms Furse is regarded as a woman with an iron fist and a steel will. Her background is in the complex world of derivatives. She was previously head of Credit Lyonnais Rouse, where she wielded the jobs axe and introduced new technology. She has also been deputy chairman of Liffe. Born in Canada to Dutch parents, she has lived in the UK since she was a teenager and speaks Dutch, German, Spanish and French. Julia Finch 4 Donatella Versace Platinum brain pushes designs to new heights Donatella Versace was once regarded as little more than her brother's little sister and muse. But after Gianni's murder in Miami in 1997 the woman with the trademark curtain of platinum hair took over as both the business and design brains behind the Milan fashion house and the multimillion lire empire has gone from strength to strength. When he died, she said, \"I knew what I had to do. I never thought about stopping. I felt Gianni telling me what I had to do.\" Ms Versace - age kept secret - dresses the world's A-list celebrities. Last year she was Madonna's bridesmaid. She has altered the style of Versace. The trademark raunchy dresses have not been eradicated but the designs have moved away from the overtly sexual towards a cooler, simpler chic. Ms Versace has little time for women who do not work. \"I would not design for a woman who does not work because a woman must have a relationship with the world,\" she said recently. 5 Anita Roddick Maverick with an eye on the wider horizon As businesswomen go, Anita Roddick is undoubtedly one of the most influential, unusual and eccentric of her generation. It is now more than 25 years since Ms Roddick set up shop in Brighton, with a \u00a34,000 bank loan on a platform of rejecting animal testing and embracing ethical trading practices. In that time the Body Shop has expanded to an 1,800-shop international empire and created a \u00a330m fortune. Yet Ms Roddick insists she is uninterested in money. She drives a 10-year-old VW Golf, often takes public transport and has told her daughters that they will not inherit her millions. \"Far better to give it away,\" she says. In recent years the Body Shop has had problems and Ms Roddick has transferred her attention to wider issues, like human rights and globalisation. She recently took time to \"travel with hobos\" in the US. She is a director of the Ruckus society, which runs a camp teaching the tactics of peaceful civil disobedience. Julia Finch",

Bullying is so rife that it was a significant factor in at least two out of five suicides in eight months, says the report by Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons. He describes the inspection, in June last year, as \"one of the most disturbing that my team and I have carried out\". It disclosed a level of neglect and lack of understanding of the young prisoners' needs that was \"breathtaking\". Sir David says he was particularly angered to discover that such bad conditions still existed within a young offenders' institution despite similar damning reports into Feltham, London; Glen Parva, Leicestershire; Portland, Dorset; and Werrington, Staffordshire. \"That conditions as disgraceful as those at Brinsford exist is shameful enough, but the fact that this report follows similar situations at other [young offenders' institutions] is inexcusable,\" says the chief inspector, particularly in the face of the government's concentration on youth justice. \"This should never have been allowed to happen by the prison service itself, but I am sorry I did not intervene earlier to ensure the treatment afforded to young prisoners was of an acceptable standard.\" Sir David promises to return to Brinsford in six months' time but says he \"fears, on the evidence of past experience, nothing may have happened to rectify the situation\". The inspection report details the lack of any workshops and the limited opportunities for association and exercise, with too many young people spending far too much time locked in their cells. The inspection team itself saw evidence of bullying and concluded that staff had either surrendered to what they regarded as the inevitable or were fighting a rearguard action. Sir David says he was disappointed to find that only lip service was being paid to the implementation of new child protection measures. Youth jails were brought within the provisions of the Children Act, which are supposed to lead to the intervention of outside social services staff when children are found at risk of abuse. The chief inspector found that while the child protection log had been set up at Brinsford, no cases had been entered into it. Martin Narey, the director-general of the prison service, claimed that significant progress had been made at Brinsford since the inspection, including the provision of more than 20 hours a week of purposeful activity out of prisoners' cells. \"As Sir David knows, the introduction of functional management across the juvenile estate from April 1 will give additional scrutiny to the management of under 18s at Brinsford, and ensure greater consistency,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Shutdown shortcut</strong><br> I read recently about a shortcut to shut down Windows without going through the Start menu. Could you tell me how to do it? <strong>Linda Waddington </strong><br> <a href=\"mailto:linda_wad@yahoo.com\">linda_wad@yahoo.com</a>. </p> <p><strong>Jack Schofield replies:</strong> It is a bad idea to shut down too quickly, as Microsoft has found with Windows 98SE and Me on some very fast computers. IDE hard disk drives store data in their own cache memories before writing it to the hard drive. Windows has no way of knowing if the drive has finished the job. In a fast shutdown, cached data may be lost, leading to corrupted files. Microsoft has therefore released a patch to add a two-second delay to the shutdown process. See article Q273017 at <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/ rticles/q273/0/17.asp\" target=\"_new\"> http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/ rticles/q273/0/17.asp</a> </p> <p> However, there are a number of utilities that provide a more convenient shutdown routine. Examples include CloseFast 2000 &lt;a href=\"http://www.davecentral.com/12045.html ), ShutDown NOW! ( www. dworld.de ) and ShutDownKing (\"<a href=\"http://www.shutdownking.de/\">www.shutdownking.de/</a> english/ ). I have not tried them. You can also learn how to make your own shutdown button very easily at the PC Clinic at <a href=\"http://www.md4pc.com/questions/05.htm\">www.md4pc.com/questions/05.htm </a>. </p> <p><strong> Defragging</strong><br> When I run Defrag, I find it keeps restarting because \"disk contents have changed\". I was told that this could be cured by using Control-Alt-Delete to end all tasks except Explorer and Systray, but I still experience the problem with Defrag and Scandisk. I have Windows 98SE. <strong>Michael Ennals</strong><br> <a href=\"mailto:michael@mjennals.icom43.net\">michael@mjennals.icom43.net</a> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Your approach should work. Sometimes it doesn't. </p> <p>The easiest way to run Scandisk is to go to Start|Shutdown and select Restart in MS-DOS Mode. Simply type Scandisk at the C:\\WINDOWS&gt; prompt. </p> <p>To run Disk Defragmenter, either restart your PC in Safe Mode or try a \"clean boot\". Microsoft's help file describes both approaches in article Q186978 at <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q186/9/78.asp\" target=\"_new\">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q186/9/78.asp</a> </p> <p><strong> Anti-virus time</strong><br> I have a 486 laptop running Windows 3.1 but it has no CD. Where can I get an anti-virus program for it? I also have a desktop PC with internet access so I could download a program that will fit on a floppy. <strong>Cowan Ervine </strong><br> <a href=\"mailto:carol@ervine.freeuk.com\">carol@ervine.freeuk.com</a> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> I recommend Frisk Software's F-Prot for DOS, which is small and free for personal use.

Sign.def , the virus definition file, dated February 16, is only 830K. </p> <p>You could copy large files to your laptop using a compression program that spans disks. For example, with WinZip 7, you can use Windows Explorer to create a new archive on a floppy, such as A:\\massive.zip (or whatever). Use the mouse to drag and drop files into that. When the floppy is full, WinZip will ask for another. However, you cannot do this with an existing zip file, and you cannot remove files once the archive occupies more than one disk. </p> <p>Before scanning for viruses, you should boot your PC from a write-protected floppy disk that is known to be virus-free. This could be the Windows Startup Disk created when the operating system was installed, or the one you made as soon as you got your new PC. </p> <p>To make one, go to Start|Settings|Control Panel and double-click the icon for Add/Remove Programs. Click on the tab for Startup Disk, then click the button labelled Create Disk. </p> <p><strong> Capitals offence</strong><br> My version of Microsoft Word gives me a capital at the beginning of a line when it is not wanted.

I would like to be able to use the printer, scanner, Zip drive and favourite old games I own. Should I choose Windows ME or Windows 2000?

Recently, however, it seems to suffer from the cold and appears to need warming up to function properly. After starting up it runs for about two minutes and then freezes.

      "body": "<p>A state of emergency has been declared in Seattle after a major earthquake shook the US Pacific north-west yesterday, causing one death, serious injuries and widespread damage in the city. Tremors were felt as far away as Salt Lake City, Utah. </p> <p>A man died of a heart attack north of Seattle as a result of the quake, Washington state Governor Gary Locke said. Twenty-five people were injured in the Seattle area, five seriously, according to Jim Mullen, Seattle Director of Emergency Services. Across the state, 163 people were reported injured, three seriously.</p> <p>Mr Locke said losses could run into billions of dollars. Seattle's corporate pride - Boeing, Microsoft and Starbucks - all sustained damage.</p> <p>The earthquake, which was measured at 6.8 on the Richter scale, closed the Seattle-Tacoma airport, prompted searches for people trapped in buildings, sent thousands of office workers scurrying into the streets, and brought a technology conference being addressed by the head of Microsoft, Bill Gates, to a dramatic halt. </p> <p>It struck just after researchers in California had announced that the risks of major damage from a quake in the area were greater than had been expected. </p> <p>The new assessment was prompted by findings in the wake of last month's devastating earthquake in Gujarat, India, which killed about 20,000. </p> <p>The epicentre of yesterday's earthquake was about 36 miles south-west of Seattle and 11 miles north-east of the state capital, Olympia. </p> <p>One of the most powerful quakes in the area for more than half a century, it caused extensive damage in central Seattle and elsewhere in the city. </p> <p>Flights in and out of the city were immediately halted, as were all train arrivals and departures, while the damage was assessed. </p> <p>Twenty-five people were injured, four seriously, but the initial reaction was that the city's earthquake preparations had proved largely effective, particularly considering the force of the earthquake. </p> <p>The tremor began at 10.54am and lasted for about 45 seconds. It caused alarm in Seattle's highrise office buildings which swayed visibly. </p> <p>\"I work downtown, in one of those 'new and earthquake-improved' buildings on rollers or whatever they are, and boy, this thing moved,\" a local resident, Alicia Kamenick, said. </p> <p>\"I'm still a little freaked out, but it sounds like we were lucky. It was deep enough so there wasn't as much damage as there could have been.\" </p> <p>President George Bush described it as \"a serious situation\" and said he had contacted the federal emergency management agency (Fema), which handles such events, and had been assured that everything was under control. </p> <p>It emerged yesterday that one of the budget cuts proposed by the new administration is $25m (about \u00a317m) from a Fema programme which prepares communities to deal with earthquakes. </p> <p>The mayor of Seattle, Paul Schell, said that the preparations made for such eventualities appeared to have paid off. \"The city's infrastructure seems to have come through this in pretty good shape,\" he said. </p> <p>About 20,000 people lost power as a result of the shock, according to the local utilities board. It was also felt south of Seattle in Portland, Oregon, and picked up by siesmologists in California. </p> <p>A strong earthquake also shook the capital of El Salvador yesterday. It was reported to be of a magnitude of 5.4. </p> <p> Tim Radford writes: The Seattle earthquake should not have come as a shock: researchers calculated 10 years ago that while the US north-west seemed fairly stable, it could be subject to the worst seismic violence of all. </p> <p>The earth's crust is broken into huge plates of rock, grinding and bumping against each other, and most earthquakes and volcanoes are at the spots where they meet. </p> <p>Seattle, with Vancouver, Canada, and Portland, Oregon, is where a plate of ocean basalt meets the plate bearing the American continent. </p> <p>Further south, around San Francisco and Los Angeles, two plates slide past each other with an almost continuous rumble of shocks. </p> <p>Seattle and the cities near it are subject to different forces. Under Seattle, the ocean basalt dives deep into the earth's mantle, throwing up the Cascade mountain ranges, and several volcanoes. </p> <p>One of these, Mount St Helens, exploded with awesome force in 1980. </p> <p>But even then, Cascadia was thought to be a relatively safe place. Then seismologists began to ask themselves why there were huge layers of peat buried beneath dunes of sand far inland. The only sensible answer was that tsunamis - so called tidal waves - had repeatedly inundated the coast. </p> <p>Japanese scientists looking at a sequence of tsunami damage found written evidence of one that washed over their main island, Honshu, 300 years ago. </p> <p>They calculated that it could only have come from a massive earthquake which must have occurred along the coast near modern-day Seattle on the night of January 26 1700. </p> <p>Their US colleagues calculated that this quake must have been a magnitude of 9 - an intensity that would release thousands of times more destructive energy than anything seen in history in California.</p>",

The earthquake, which was measured at 6.8 on the Richter scale, closed the Seattle-Tacoma airport, prompted searches for people trapped in buildings, sent thousands of office workers scurrying into the streets, and brought a technology conference being addressed by the head of Microsoft, Bill Gates, to a dramatic halt. It struck just after researchers in California had announced that the risks of major damage from a quake in the area were greater than had been expected. The new assessment was prompted by findings in the wake of last month's devastating earthquake in Gujarat, India, which killed about 20,000. The epicentre of yesterday's earthquake was about 36 miles south-west of Seattle and 11 miles north-east of the state capital, Olympia. One of the most powerful quakes in the area for more than half a century, it caused extensive damage in central Seattle and elsewhere in the city. Flights in and out of the city were immediately halted, as were all train arrivals and departures, while the damage was assessed. Twenty-five people were injured, four seriously, but the initial reaction was that the city's earthquake preparations had proved largely effective, particularly considering the force of the earthquake. The tremor began at 10.54am and lasted for about 45 seconds. It caused alarm in Seattle's highrise office buildings which swayed visibly. \"I work downtown, in one of those 'new and earthquake-improved' buildings on rollers or whatever they are, and boy, this thing moved,\" a local resident, Alicia Kamenick, said. \"I'm still a little freaked out, but it sounds like we were lucky. It was deep enough so there wasn't as much damage as there could have been.\" President George Bush described it as \"a serious situation\" and said he had contacted the federal emergency management agency (Fema), which handles such events, and had been assured that everything was under control. It emerged yesterday that one of the budget cuts proposed by the new administration is $25m (about \u00a317m) from a Fema programme which prepares communities to deal with earthquakes. The mayor of Seattle, Paul Schell, said that the preparations made for such eventualities appeared to have paid off. \"The city's infrastructure seems to have come through this in pretty good shape,\" he said. About 20,000 people lost power as a result of the shock, according to the local utilities board. It was also felt south of Seattle in Portland, Oregon, and picked up by siesmologists in California. A strong earthquake also shook the capital of El Salvador yesterday. It was reported to be of a magnitude of 5.4. Tim Radford writes: The Seattle earthquake should not have come as a shock: researchers calculated 10 years ago that while the US north-west seemed fairly stable, it could be subject to the worst seismic violence of all. The earth's crust is broken into huge plates of rock, grinding and bumping against each other, and most earthquakes and volcanoes are at the spots where they meet. Seattle, with Vancouver, Canada, and Portland, Oregon, is where a plate of ocean basalt meets the plate bearing the American continent. Further south, around San Francisco and Los Angeles, two plates slide past each other with an almost continuous rumble of shocks. Seattle and the cities near it are subject to different forces. Under Seattle, the ocean basalt dives deep into the earth's mantle, throwing up the Cascade mountain ranges, and several volcanoes. One of these, Mount St Helens, exploded with awesome force in 1980. But even then, Cascadia was thought to be a relatively safe place. Then seismologists began to ask themselves why there were huge layers of peat buried beneath dunes of sand far inland. The only sensible answer was that tsunamis - so called tidal waves - had repeatedly inundated the coast. Japanese scientists looking at a sequence of tsunami damage found written evidence of one that washed over their main island, Honshu, 300 years ago. They calculated that it could only have come from a massive earthquake which must have occurred along the coast near modern-day Seattle on the night of January 26 1700. Their US colleagues calculated that this quake must have been a magnitude of 9 - an intensity that would release thousands of times more destructive energy than anything seen in history in California.",

Northern Ireland (3-5-2): Taylor (Fulham); Hughes (Newcastle), Taggart (Leicester), Murdoch (Preston); McCarthy (Birmingham), Magilton (Ipswich), Lennon (Celtic), Whitley (Manchester City), Kennedy (Watford); Healy (Preston), Ferguson (Linfield). Norway (4-5-1): Myhre; Bergdolmo, Lundekvam, Stensaas, Berg; Solskjaer, Tessem, Larsen, Bakke, Helstad; Carew. Referee: Kenny Clark (Scotland). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>An XI of legendary English football club managers from the second half of the 20th century would probably comprise Busby, Rowe, Ramsey, Shankly, Paisley, Revie, Robson, Ferguson, Nicholson and Clough . . . with Stan Cullis unquestionably in the team at centre-half. Yesterday Cullis joined the first six in their celestial touchline dugout. </p> <p>On these pages once, John Arlott called Cullis \"the passionate puritan\", which was probably spot-on. As an implacable but stylish No5, Cullis played 12 times for England (and on a further 20 occasions in wartime matches) but it was with Wolverhampton Wanderers that his name is imperishably coupled.</p> <p>As a player from 1934-1947 he helped make Wolves a force in the land; then as manager till 1964 he made them a force in the world. He was in the Wolves senior team at 17 and captain at 19; by 22 he was captain of England. \"Passionate puritan\", sure, and a ruthless disciplinarian as well, but he also brought an enlightened intellect to the game.</p> <p>Like so many others with much still to offer, he was allowed to drift away from soccer by the Football Association and he had long been a forgotten figure when, out of the blue this winter, a rewarding biography* was published by Jim Holden in which the writer poignantly answered his own question: \"You may wonder how Cullis feels about the fall from grace of his beloved Wolves and their endless struggle to recapture the glories he routinely gave them? Sadly, we cannot know. By the time this book was conceived it was too late to ask him . . . his health and his memory too frail, he lives quietly and peacefully in a nursing home in the Malvern Hills, unable to recall the past with any clarity.\"</p> <p>Cullis was born, the youngest of 10, in 1916 on the Wirral where his father, a devout Wolves fan, had been \"relocated\" for the war effort with the Wolverhampton Corrugated Iron Company.</p> <p>Cullis told me once that his ambition had been to be a \"campaigning journalist\" and at 16 he was going to night school to that effect when his aptitude for football attracted various league clubs.</p> <p>His father ordered: \"You'll go to one club and no other.\" It was of course Wolves, then managed by the \"martinet of Molineux\", Major Frank Buckley, from whom, he said, he \"learned to handle footballers with a rigorous authority, and far more iron than velvet in your touch\".</p> <p>Like an old-fashioned No5, in fact. Another sometime Guardian writer, Arthur Hopcraft, described Cullis playing in his heyday: \"An intent crouch, bald forehead jutting belligerently forward, he seldom allowed himself a careless contact with the ball. He defined the position 'centre-half' for me, not just by the way he went crushingly into a tackle or hit a long pass firmly to one of his wingers: it was the sternness of the man himself which fixed the role - being a centre-half was an austere responsibility which permitted no frivolous embellishments of manner.\"</p> <p>In May 1947 the final match of the season had Wolves playing Liverpool for, in effect, the league title. Liverpool won, and Cullis retired there and then to the manager's office. He at once fashioned a fit and vibrant team - long, direct passes, clever wing play and first-time shooting - and he drove them on with a relentless, impassioned determination. They won three league championships and the FA Cup twice, but most famously - this before official European competition - he arranged what he called \"prestige\" floodlit matches against foreign opposition in 1954 and 1955. Moscow Spartak were beaten by 4-0, Moscow Dynamo by 2-1, and Honved (with six of the Hungarians who had humiliated England in 1953) by 3-2, which had the Daily Mail's front-page banner proclaiming \"Cullis's Kings of the World\".</p> <p>Between 1949 and 1960, Cullis's Wolves finished out of the top three only three times.

      "bodyText": "An XI of legendary English football club managers from the second half of the 20th century would probably comprise Busby, Rowe, Ramsey, Shankly, Paisley, Revie, Robson, Ferguson, Nicholson and Clough . . . with Stan Cullis unquestionably in the team at centre-half. Yesterday Cullis joined the first six in their celestial touchline dugout. On these pages once, John Arlott called Cullis \"the passionate puritan\", which was probably spot-on. As an implacable but stylish No5, Cullis played 12 times for England (and on a further 20 occasions in wartime matches) but it was with Wolverhampton Wanderers that his name is imperishably coupled. As a player from 1934-1947 he helped make Wolves a force in the land; then as manager till 1964 he made them a force in the world. He was in the Wolves senior team at 17 and captain at 19; by 22 he was captain of England. \"Passionate puritan\", sure, and a ruthless disciplinarian as well, but he also brought an enlightened intellect to the game. Like so many others with much still to offer, he was allowed to drift away from soccer by the Football Association and he had long been a forgotten figure when, out of the blue this winter, a rewarding biography* was published by Jim Holden in which the writer poignantly answered his own question: \"You may wonder how Cullis feels about the fall from grace of his beloved Wolves and their endless struggle to recapture the glories he routinely gave them? Sadly, we cannot know. By the time this book was conceived it was too late to ask him . . . his health and his memory too frail, he lives quietly and peacefully in a nursing home in the Malvern Hills, unable to recall the past with any clarity.\" Cullis was born, the youngest of 10, in 1916 on the Wirral where his father, a devout Wolves fan, had been \"relocated\" for the war effort with the Wolverhampton Corrugated Iron Company. Cullis told me once that his ambition had been to be a \"campaigning journalist\" and at 16 he was going to night school to that effect when his aptitude for football attracted various league clubs. His father ordered: \"You'll go to one club and no other.\" It was of course Wolves, then managed by the \"martinet of Molineux\", Major Frank Buckley, from whom, he said, he \"learned to handle footballers with a rigorous authority, and far more iron than velvet in your touch\". Like an old-fashioned No5, in fact. Another sometime Guardian writer, Arthur Hopcraft, described Cullis playing in his heyday: \"An intent crouch, bald forehead jutting belligerently forward, he seldom allowed himself a careless contact with the ball. He defined the position 'centre-half' for me, not just by the way he went crushingly into a tackle or hit a long pass firmly to one of his wingers: it was the sternness of the man himself which fixed the role - being a centre-half was an austere responsibility which permitted no frivolous embellishments of manner.\" In May 1947 the final match of the season had Wolves playing Liverpool for, in effect, the league title. Liverpool won, and Cullis retired there and then to the manager's office. He at once fashioned a fit and vibrant team - long, direct passes, clever wing play and first-time shooting - and he drove them on with a relentless, impassioned determination. They won three league championships and the FA Cup twice, but most famously - this before official European competition - he arranged what he called \"prestige\" floodlit matches against foreign opposition in 1954 and 1955. Moscow Spartak were beaten by 4-0, Moscow Dynamo by 2-1, and Honved (with six of the Hungarians who had humiliated England in 1953) by 3-2, which had the Daily Mail's front-page banner proclaiming \"Cullis's Kings of the World\". Between 1949 and 1960, Cullis's Wolves finished out of the top three only three times. In 1964, however, after two mediocre seasons, a brash new chairman, John Ireland, suddenly sacked him. Cullis said: \"I simply created a yardstick which people could criticise me against.\" He managed Birmingham City, successfully enough, for five more seasons, but the whole game knew his heart and soul remained at Molineux. Retired comfortably to the Malverns, he wrought for a few years some concise Sunday journalism and courteously welcomed any passer-by wanting to chew the fat about his beloved club. Three times in the three decades that I have lurked in this corner of these pages, I have been instructed to cover the \"old gold turns to dross\" story, that is the decline into toothlesness by the once fierce and feared Wolves. Each time I'd go to Molineux via Malvern. After my last visit, about 10 years ago, I received a letter in a bold, neat hand: \"Our conversation refreshed me, but I am not sure I quite managed what I had meant to, which was to avoid any suggestion of 'blowing my own trumpet' - but after John Ireland had so obviously enjoyed sacking me after my 30 years of service to the club, I received two particular letters which you might like to quote: one from Sir Matt Busby saying Wolves would never again enjoy the reputation they had established in the football world and forecasting 'this will surely be the beginning of the end for them', and another from Bill Shankly expressing the very same opinion, although hardly in the same parliamentary language used by Matt.\" Yesterday, at last, good, stern Stan broke free of his bitter, umbilical Molineux. Now, in peace, he can happily haunt the place for ever. *Stan Cullis - The Iron Manager, by Jim Holden (\u00a315.99, Breedon Books).",

      "body": "<p>John Tavener's music is conceived as a spiritual balm to heal the wounds of a divided and troubled world. Introducing his programme with the Endymion Ensemble, part of its Composer Choice Series, he urged the audience to \"listen with the intellectual organ of the heart\" and to find a way to vanquish \"the demon of modernism\". Tavener's concert of his own music - alongside works by Anton Webern, Arvo Part and the 12th-century mystic Hildegard von Bingen - was contemplative rather than aggressive. </p> <p>Tavener's Akhmatova Songs for string quartet and soprano featured Patricia Rozario as soloist. Rozario has inspired many of Tavener's recent vocal works and she possesses a voice of extraordinary refinement and accuracy. Even in the cruelly exposed lines of these settings, which frequently soar into the voice's highest register, Rozario nearly always maintained her focused tone and technical assurance. She brought the same qualities to Hildegard's settings of visionary religious texts, O viridissima virga and Ave, generosa. Accompanied only by an austere drone, Rozario crafted a rapturous serenity. </p> <p>Tavener's love of Hildegard's music is not just spiritual but aesthetic. The ornamentation in his settings of Anna Akhmatova's poetry - as well as the subdued melancholy of his Thrinos for solo cello, performed by Jane Salmon - seems to be directly inspired by Hildegard's vocal writing. But a comparison between two composers highlights the problems with Tavener's musical worldview. Although he writes his music to save contemporary consciousness from the evils of modernism, Tavener is wholly reliant on the \"modernist\" institutions of concert halls and recording companies for his success. Instead of listening to his music \"with the heart\", we listen to it as an aesthetic object, in much the same way as we listen to a Beethoven symphony. Hildegard's music was not designed as a work of art as we now understand the term, but Tavener's, for all his protestations, most definitely is. </p> <p>All this isn't to deny the sheer beauty of music such as Tavener's The Child Lived, a setting of words by his spiritual advisor Mother Thekla, for soprano and solo cello. It's just to point out that the composer's project of world-renewal is necessarily doomed because his music plays the very games his philosophy tries to denigrate: a decidedly modernist contradiction.</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Tavener's music is conceived as a spiritual balm to heal the wounds of a divided and troubled world. Introducing his programme with the Endymion Ensemble, part of its Composer Choice Series, he urged the audience to \"listen with the intellectual organ of the heart\" and to find a way to vanquish \"the demon of modernism\". Tavener's concert of his own music - alongside works by Anton Webern, Arvo Part and the 12th-century mystic Hildegard von Bingen - was contemplative rather than aggressive. Tavener's Akhmatova Songs for string quartet and soprano featured Patricia Rozario as soloist. Rozario has inspired many of Tavener's recent vocal works and she possesses a voice of extraordinary refinement and accuracy. Even in the cruelly exposed lines of these settings, which frequently soar into the voice's highest register, Rozario nearly always maintained her focused tone and technical assurance. She brought the same qualities to Hildegard's settings of visionary religious texts, O viridissima virga and Ave, generosa. Accompanied only by an austere drone, Rozario crafted a rapturous serenity. Tavener's love of Hildegard's music is not just spiritual but aesthetic. The ornamentation in his settings of Anna Akhmatova's poetry - as well as the subdued melancholy of his Thrinos for solo cello, performed by Jane Salmon - seems to be directly inspired by Hildegard's vocal writing. But a comparison between two composers highlights the problems with Tavener's musical worldview. Although he writes his music to save contemporary consciousness from the evils of modernism, Tavener is wholly reliant on the \"modernist\" institutions of concert halls and recording companies for his success. Instead of listening to his music \"with the heart\", we listen to it as an aesthetic object, in much the same way as we listen to a Beethoven symphony. Hildegard's music was not designed as a work of art as we now understand the term, but Tavener's, for all his protestations, most definitely is. All this isn't to deny the sheer beauty of music such as Tavener's The Child Lived, a setting of words by his spiritual advisor Mother Thekla, for soprano and solo cello. It's just to point out that the composer's project of world-renewal is necessarily doomed because his music plays the very games his philosophy tries to denigrate: a decidedly modernist contradiction.",

Inevitably, however, the testosterone-fuelled Argentinian hogged the limelight whenever he appeared. For much of the time you were conscious of his putting on a self-dramatising act. </p> <p>He kicked the evening off with Manrico's Serenade from Il Trovatore. In the opera it is sung offstage, and Cura duly began it in the artist's room, bounding on to the platform at the line \"A troubadour is greater than any king\". He was dressed to slay, looking impeccably Byronic in tight pants and a flowing black silk shirt. Thereafter he played games with the audience. He conducted the overture to Nabucco himself. The house went wild, and Cura, having left the podium, kept peering back into the auditorium with a look of surprise as if to say: \"Is all this for me?\" In the duet from the third act of Aida, he joined Dessi by making a grand entrance at the back of the stalls. Had there been an available chandelier, I suspect he might have swung from it. </p> <p>True, such antics do break down the formulaic structure of the operatic extracts concert, but they also detract mightily on occasion from the singing. Fortunately Cura wins hands down on musical talent alone. Although he has been dubbed \"the fourth tenor\", his voice and style hark back to a previous generation of performers, the great tenors of the 1950s such as Franco Corelli and Mario del Monaco. The sound is dark and thrilling, his delivery ballsy and impactive. He's a fine vocal actor, colouring his voice to suit each character, a fact that emerged only gradually during the evening. </p> <p>The first half of the concert focused on Verdi's flamboyant heroes - dangerously glamorous figures such as Corrado from Il Corsaro, Ernani and Radames, the principled warrior from Aida. Each of them was rawly, thrillingly portrayed, though it wasn't until after the interval that we were able to appreciate the full depth and range of Cura's singing. Here he offered us the self-doubting Alvaro from La Forza del Destino and his Don Carlos - introverted, neurotic and profoundly moving. As an encore, he gave us a glimpse of his Otello, tracking Dessi's Desdemona in the love duet from the first act with the touching naivety of an enraptured innocent. </p> <p>Dessi, sadly, isn't in his league. She's unfailingly accurate and sensitive to both phrasing and textual nuance, but the tone sometimes curdles and you miss the opulent sheen of truly great Verdi sopranos such as Renata Tebaldi and Leontyne Price. Morandi, however, is a real find, an immaculate judge of the pace, ebb and flow of this music. The playing by the LSO was simply to die for.</p>",
