No movement of animals and no auctions as the local farmers, so badly hit by the foot and mouth epidemic of 1967, go about their business with a stoic fatalism. Yet for the past three days, deep in the south-east of the county, those with an eye for a sturdy foot and a sound pair of lungs have been gathering from all parts of the country for their very own cattle market. </p> <p>No bulls, cows or heifers, of course. Just footballers, that very peculiar animal much prone to foot in the mouth. For this has been the week of the annual late winter sales, more properly known as the FA Premier League assessment trials. </p> <p>The euphoria of England's victory over Spain seemed even to have laid a golden hand on the national sports centre at Lilleshall yesterday morning, the bright March sunshine slowly releasing the frost-bound pitches and encouraging the birds into spring song. But there was tension in the air, tinged with fear. </p> <p>Following the stud marks down the neat gravel paths that run between box hedges from the hall to the playing fields were a group of men, some young, some old, some battered, some neatly groomed, who held in their hands, along with their mobile phones and the names and numbers of all the players taking part, the power to break hearts and shatter dreams. </p> <p>These were the scouts, an amorphous bunch who scour Britain on behalf of league and non-league clubs, searching out talent with a fanaticism born of many motives. \"There are all sorts. Some can assess your oppositions and tell you precisely how they will play, their strengths and weaknesses. Others can fill your needs, like finding a reliable defender. Others can spot the stars of the future,\" said the former Aston Villa, Crewe and Swansea goalkeeper Geoff Crudgington, who now works as the community officer with Plymouth Argyle. </p> <p>All the players at these three-day assessment trials - the under-18s and under-19s on Monday and Tuesday, the under-16s yesterday - had one thing in common. They had not been offered a contract, or a contract extension, by their Premiership club. </p> <p>\"You're looking at lads who have been used to success. The best at their school, or the best in their county. Now they are facing their first major knock-back,\" said Crudgington. </p> <p>It does not make for an easy atmosphere. The unremitting energy and enthusiasm were abundantly obvious, but it was not pleasant, the strain of wanting to impress being all too obvious. </p> <p>\"I still love the game, but it can be wicked,\" said Tom Meachen, watching on behalf of Rotherham United. \"The competition is huge, but I worry that not enough is being done at the grass-roots level. There isn't the quality of coaching in the schools. And you'd think, considering these lads here today have spent four or five years with a Premiership club, that I would be able to recommend half a dozen of them to Rotherham.

And to my mind that's because he's often too deep and isolated rather than searching for the ball inside and doing damage in the final third. </p> <p>His best moments on Wednesday night came when he dropped off the touchline, almost releasing Michael Owen at one point, and I would like to see him do that more frequently and get in more advanced positions. </p> <p>That doesn't necessarily mean playing him as one of the two central midfielders. From the right he should be able to get in those great crosses while also coming inside to link up with the front players and threaten 30 yards from goal with shots and killer passes. </p> <p>I know if I was managing a team faced with Beckham I would be happy to see him in those deeper areas or tied to the flank. It's far easier to pressurise him there, so he mustn't be obsessed with receiving passes from the back players and just hitting balls Gary or Phil Neville could do for him. He is at his best when he comes inside, makes a positive pass and then gets on his bike. </p> <p>Hopefully Sven-Goran Eriksson will give him that licence to roam, look for the ball and dictate the play. </p> <p>On the opposite flank there was a big plus point in Barmby, who I think is a better international player than he is for Liverpool. I had felt Steve McManaman would get that berth but he may find Barmby difficult to dislodge. </p> <p>Barmby was very busy, did the simple things quickly and, having played as a striker, he has a nose for timing his runs and getting into the box. Those darts from midfield cause panic for defenders. He may not always receive a pass but it occupies opponents and can give the man on the ball better options. </p> <p>The fact that Barmby will not swing over many crosses from the left doesn't bother me overly. When he comes inside the left-back can get forward to do that and, in any case, Barmby has the ability to spot a quick pass. </p> <p>Plenty of others, such as Sol Campbell, Chris Powell and Gavin McCann, came out with credit. But it was young Lampard of West Ham who particularly caught my eye. He looked a lot stronger than on his last England appearance against Belgium, showed good authority, high energy and an ability to spot a pass. He may have staked a claim for a regular place, particularly if Steven Gerrard is not fit. </p> <p>Michael Owen settled better than most would have expected into that withdrawn striker's position. One of the criticisms levelled at him is that he is not a good link-up man, but he was tidy, worked hard and he not only set up Barmby's goal but nearly provided another. </p> <p>The fact remains, though, that he is at his best when he is driving at the near post or looking for threaded through-balls, and I'm not sure he has the vision of a natural link striker. Teddy Sheringham is so quick-thinking that he has the next pass sorted when the ball reaches him. </p> <p>Yet Wednesday's performance was the best since the 2-0 win over Ukraine last May. There was great energy and, importantly, a good tempo. We will never be a patient international team because that doesn't suit us, but this showed that if we play at an English tempo and are positive we can be dangerous. </p> <p>That means getting the ball into midfield and then into the front players quickly with penetrating passes. For all the Brazilians' great ability on the ball they play through people, and France do not take too long either to build an attack. I wonder whether it might help playing away from Wembley, which seemed to lend itself to a more studious game. </p> <p>All in all I feel more positive than after the 1-1 draw in Paris, when a few people may have got a bit carried away. That was clearly a friendly and I fancy the French could have turned on the tap if they had wanted. </p> <p>On Wednesday, England had to earn the right to play and, although I'm not getting carried away, as a start it was seven out of 10. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "trailText": "<p>Ken Bates told MPs yesterday that the new national stadium should have been built in Manchester, and had a good go at the role of sports minister Kate Hoey.</p>",
      "byline": "Vivek Chaudhary",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Ken Bates, who was removed as chairman of Wembley National Stadium Limited last December following criticism over his handling of the project, told MPs yesterday that the new national stadium should have been built in Manchester. </p> <p>Bates said: \"In 1997 I said that this [Wembley] would be a total cock-up, let's go to Manchester or Birmingham. I advocated Manchester but also thought we could take the games around the country. But by that time the die was cast.\" </p> <p>And Bates's replacement, Sir Rodney Walker, also giving evidence to the parliamentry select committee for culture, media and sport, said the stadium should perhaps have been built in Birmingham, which submitted the best proposal when bids for a new national stadium were invited. </p> <p>Despite that, officials eventually opted for Wembley even though there were concerns about its location. </p> <p>Bates also launched a blistering attack on the sports minister Kate Hoey. He told MPs her constant interference in the project and insistence that athletics should be included had delayed the rebuilding of Wembley by 19 months and increased costs by \u00a330m. She had also been one of the main reasons that WNSL had failed to raise the \u00a3410m needed to finance the project. </p> <p>The Chelsea chairman said she had constantly criticised the project and refused to attend meetings over issues such as how athletics could be included by constructing a platform that would carry a track. </p> <p>He said: \"Since Kate Hoey was appointed sports minister, there was nothing but criticism. We have had 19 months of knocking the project.

      "bodyText": "Ken Bates, who was removed as chairman of Wembley National Stadium Limited last December following criticism over his handling of the project, told MPs yesterday that the new national stadium should have been built in Manchester. Bates said: \"In 1997 I said that this [Wembley] would be a total cock-up, let's go to Manchester or Birmingham. I advocated Manchester but also thought we could take the games around the country. But by that time the die was cast.\" And Bates's replacement, Sir Rodney Walker, also giving evidence to the parliamentry select committee for culture, media and sport, said the stadium should perhaps have been built in Birmingham, which submitted the best proposal when bids for a new national stadium were invited. Despite that, officials eventually opted for Wembley even though there were concerns about its location. Bates also launched a blistering attack on the sports minister Kate Hoey. He told MPs her constant interference in the project and insistence that athletics should be included had delayed the rebuilding of Wembley by 19 months and increased costs by \u00a330m. She had also been one of the main reasons that WNSL had failed to raise the \u00a3410m needed to finance the project. The Chelsea chairman said she had constantly criticised the project and refused to attend meetings over issues such as how athletics could be included by constructing a platform that would carry a track. He said: \"Since Kate Hoey was appointed sports minister, there was nothing but criticism. We have had 19 months of knocking the project. We were supposed to be pulling together but all she did was undermine everything. \"She was leaking to the press all the time but what she was saying was based on total ignorance. One of the problems with the sports minister was that she never contacted me for a briefing to take her through the project. We only knew what she thought through the papers. \"Within two weeks of her taking office she had changed designs without any consultation. She was not qualified to do so and it is not the government's job to get involved in these sorts of things.\" Bates denied he was responsible for the project's failure. \"My biggest mistake was listening to the minister and her advisers.\" Walker said Birmingham had submitted the best bid for the site of the new national stadium, although officials had been told Solihull council was unlikely to give planning permission because of concerns over traffic congestion. He also informed MPs that he had been examining all aspects of the Wembley project and that even though athletics had been ruled out for the time being, the sport might return in the long run. Walker added that Wembley officials were confident they would be able to raise the finance for the project. \"I have become increasingly confident that when I return to the City having got an increased level of support from the FA we will get a more positive response.\" Trevor Brooking of Sport England raised concerns about the Picketts Lock stadium after it emerged that the Greater London Authority would not underwrite the 2005 world athletics championships for which it is being built.

      "bodyText": "The Government came under fresh criticism this morning over the foot and mouth crisis when it was revealed that the Downing Street website on rural Britain makes no mention of the outbreak. Despite nearly two weeks passing since the first reported case of foot and mouth, the \"Backing Rural Britain\" section of the prime minister's website ignores the epidemic which has now spread to every corner of the UK. Indeed, it refers to the \"forthcoming\" rural white paper on the countryside - despite the fact that it was published last November. The lack of up-to-date information has been criticised as \"symbolic\" by the Countryside Alliance. A spokesman for the group said \"The site is hugely outdated. \"This shows what we have been arguing \u0096 that politicians take no interest in rural concerns and have an absurd set of priorities.\" The site even includes the disclaimer: \"No-one is trying to pretend that problems don\u0092t exist\", despite not mentioning the killer disease in more than six pages of text. A Downing Street spokesman said: \"There is so much information to upload we just haven't got around to it yet.\" The pages \u0096 entitled Backing Rural Britain, within the factfiles of the Downing Street site \u0096 end with the comment: \"Later this year the government will publish a rural white paper.\" In fact, the document came out on November 28 last year. But up to the minute information on the spread of the foot and mouth epidemic can be found on the ministry for agriculture, fisheries and food site. Six new cases of the diseases, which affects sheep, cattle and pigs but not humans, were confirmed yesterday, bringing the total to 35 in the UK so far. Two of yesterday's cases were in Dumfrieshire, the first outbreak of the disease in Scotland since the scare started on February 20 at an abbatoir in Essex.

There is a floating walkway which leads out over the coral reef on to a large safe pontoon.You climb into the deep water and are surrounded by the most beautiful fish imaginable.Some even stood on the ladder or held on to the ropes around the edge and put their heads under water. You do not even have to swim if you are nervous.The hotel is bliss. It is in the Hayes and Jarvis Diving Brochure.</p> <p>Clare Jones</p> <p> \u0095 In September 1998 the Guardian did a big, irresistable, feature on Grenada. With my retirement coming up, my wife and I booked a four-week holiday at Coral Cove Cottages on the south of the island as a start to retirement bliss. It was paradise. The self-catering cottages are a few steps from the beach and a wooden jetty runs out over shallow water to a point where you can enter the sea without wading through seaweed and coral and over rocks. The water at the end of the jetty is only a few feet deep, generally very calm and there is a wooden ladder to lower yourself into the clear, blue water. We met Michael, who lives locally, when he brought us freshly caught crayfish (lobsters) and he arranged to take us to Hog Island in his boat later in the week. After mooring at Hog Island Michael and our son waded into the sea and went off snorkelling with a harpoon gun to catch our lunch. On their return, Michael made a fire and cooked the catch in a large iron pot, together with vegetables he'd brought with him. We enjoyed our meal which we washed down with bottles of cold beer and Michael's home-made drink which was like custard made with evaporated milk!</p> <p>It's a long way to go, not cheap but very close to heaven. Go for it.</p> <p>Gary Cornford</p> <p> \u0095 If you can afford the airfare, I would highly recommend Heron Island on the <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,410949,00.html\">Australian</a> Barrier Reef. Heron Island is a coral island on top of it's own reef, so you only have to go for a paddle to see the fish and coral.The island is a resort only open to guests who stay for a few nights or more, so it is quiet and relatively unspoilt; it is also home to a university wildlife research station.</p> <p>You can walk around the island in about half an hour and, as most of the guests spend their time diving, the beach is almost deserted when the dive boat is out. There is excellent snorkling and diving, with tuition available. When we visited in January the turtles were laying their eggs on the beach each night and birds were nesting in the trees. There is a semi-submersible boat trip so you get to see the further reaches of the reef even if you can't dive.</p> <p>The accomodation and food is to a high standard, and there are plenty of opportunities to learn about the wildlife with guided island and reef walks and talks in the evenngs. When we went in 1997 it cost about \u00a3100 per person per night for a suite of rooms with a sea view and all meals, which was a bargain for such a slice of paradise.</p> <p>I had never snorkeled before and as an average swimmer I did not feel I had missed out on anything during the trip.<br>Carol Norton</p> <p> \u0095 From the Colonial Beach Hotel in Mauritius. It is ideal for snorkelling from the part sandy, part pebbly beach - only a couple of yards into the water there are a great variety of colourful fish. A few yards further in, the variety of fish increases. The hotel is small, informal and friendly and provides free snorkelling equipment. It can be booked through Kuoni and, while Mauritius is not cheap, this hotel is one of the cheapest (early to mid-September is a good time to go).</p> <p>Frauke Sinclair</p> <p> \u0095 The island of Maui in <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413572,00.html\">Hawaii</a> offers many opportunities to snorkel over coral directly off gently shelving sandy beaches in water that is warm and mostly flat calm. Probably the best spots are in Kihei and Wailea. Right in front of the Mana Kai apartments on South Kihei Road is an extensive area of rocks covered with coral of all shapes sizes and colours with fish to match and a resident population of giant green sea turtles. You can swim over them straight off the beach, and from November to April if you swim under water you can hear whales singing. Dozens of humpback whales spend the winter in the bay and you can sit on the beach and watch then jumping. There are similar good snorkel spots all the way along this stretch and a turtle sanctuary at nearby Makena beach. <br> Andy Simpson</p> <p>\u0095 The place to go is Sharm-el-Sheik on the Sinai peninsular in <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413076,00.html\">Egypt</a>. I am 60, can just manage a width of the swimming pool provided I'm not at the deep end, and am too short sighted to see anyone more than a few feet away!</p> <p>There is a fringe reef round most of this coast and the sea is so salty that floating is especially easy. We found a beach close to our hotel where you go down some steps onto a manmade platform over the coral and then launch yourself into the sea off a ladder (just like going into a pool) and there you were, amongst the fish and within a yard of the coral! Magic!</p> <p>I found I could stay in the water for half an hour or so with no trouble. I concluded I'm a weak swimmer because I worry about not being able to breathe - the snorkelling tube eliminates that problem, and I really had a super time and would urge you to have a go.<br>Tony Krarup</p> <p>\u0095 For snorkelling straight off the beach you can't beat the Coral View Resort in Pulau Besar, Perhentian Islands, <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413437,00.html\">Malaysia</a>. The coral stacks right off the shore support hundreds of varieties of fish and an amazing range of animals from turtles to giant clams, and even black-tipped reef sharks (they're totally safe, honest, but guaranteed to cause palpitations on first viewing!)</p> <p>The Perentian Islands are off the north east coast of Malaysia, a 20-minute speedboat ride from close to Kota Bharu, and amazingly accessible from Kuala Lumpar or Singapore by train or even plane.</p> <p>Top tips for staying on Perhentian Besar are as follows. 1 Buy or borrow a mask, snorkel and flippers from a diving shop here in the UK before you go - you can hire them on the island but you'll want to be in the water for so long that the hire charges will work out more than the cost of purchase! 2 Buy a 'fish identification' sheet (one of the laminated ones) as you will want and need to know exactly what you have seen so you can brag about it for ages. 3 The islands are 'dry', so if it is important to you to have an evening bevvy, take your duty frees with you! 4 Stay at the Coral View Resort - it's got the best food, the best coral, excellent rooms, great staff, flying foxes and it's about \u00a315 per night for ensuite aircon chalets.<br>Vicki May</p> <p> \u0095 It's a long way to go, but Kauai fits the bill perfectly. We spent a week there in September and found the snorkelling was actually better from the beach than from a boat. </p> <p>There are many spots to choose from.The best bet is to ask for advice in one of the snorkel hire shops when you arrive. Our favourite was Ke'e Beach, which is enclosed by coral apart from a narrow channel. You could swim among shoals of 3 foot long fish without getting out of your depth.<br> Martin Thomas</p> <p>\u0095 Go to Villivaru Island in the Maldives which has it's own house reef a short foot-paddle from your beach bungalow. Wear a thin wetsuit for buoyancy, confidence and protection from the sun.<br> Dave George</p> <p>\u0095 Last year we went from Mission Beach (<a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,410949,00.html\">Australia</a>) to the coral reef. We were dropped on a small, beautiful sandbank, off an island, and I snorkelled over the reef from there. I am a weak swimmer but it was terrific. The skipper was environmentally sensitive and the whole trip - although it took a couple of hours to get to the reef - was friendly and enjoyable. <br> Roger Sim</p> <p>\u0095 We discovered heavenly snorkelling for beginners in Curacao. I also hope that someone is going to suggest Rangali Island in the Maldives - we are about to go there for exactly that reason.<br> Christine Bibby</p> <p>\u0095 You don't even need to swim at the Club Med in Moorea in the Pacific; simply wade out and poke your face into the water. Although they're small fry, you'll see lots of tropical fish. Our knees were even cleaned by a brilliant blue and black striped sucker fish! If you can swim about 10 metres further out, you may even see eels and tunafish.</p> <p>Another alternative (much more expensive) is Bird Island in the Seychelles. There is a protected lagoon on one side of the island. Although it doesn't have the coral that you'll find in Moorea, it's a beautiful place to visit. If you're a real landlubber, check out the giant land tortoise. And stay awake at least one night to watch the night sky, where you'll see constellations not visible from the Northern Hemisphere. Brilliant!<br> John and Phyllis Murphy</p> <p>\u0095 We traveled to Jordan last year and had some wonderful snorkeling in Aqaba. We stayed at the <a href=\"http://www.alcazarhotel.com\">Alcazar Hotel</a>, which has its own beach club adjacent to the coral reefs in the Red Sea. The hotel arranges free transport to the club, which is about eight kilometres south of Aqaba. The facilities are very good with restaurant, swimming pool and showers and you can hire snorkelling equipment. There is direct access to the reef from the beach.<br>Sue Banton</p> <p>\u0095There are several places along the <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413429,00.html\">Kenya</a> coast where the reef is quite close to the beach. My favourite is Tiwi, about 20km south of Mombasa, where at low tide you can get to the reef almost without getting your feet wet by using a sand bank that joins the beach to the reef. At high tide you have to wade a bit! There are no hotels there, and no package holidays, which for me is a major plus point, but there is self-catering accommodation and it is very easy to organise a holiday there yourself. If you don't like the cooking or cleaning part of self-catering, it is possible to employ people to do this for you.<br> Brian Thorogood</p> <p>\u0095 My friend and I class ourselves as wimps, so Coral Bay on the west coast of <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,410949,00.html\">Australia</a> was ideal for us to snorkel. You are able to walk from the shore to the reef where the sea is gentle and we never felt out of our depth. Our visit here was the first time either of us had snorkelled and for us it was by far the best place to do it in Australia. You can hire the gear for about A$12.00. The resort is unspoiled and friendly, the campsites are great (hostel not so good), and after a day under the sea the happy hour at the pub is particularly welcome.<br> Angie Thompson</p> <p>\u0095 We highly recommend the Royal Diving Centre, a 10-minure drive south of Aqaba, in Jordan. Here there is a short jetty from which you can lower yourself into four or five feet of water, and then observe not only corals, but also some beautiful fish and other colourful marine life. Do beware of stonefish on the seabed, and the occasional lion fish, though!<br>Jane and Pete, Bath.</p> <p>\u0095 The Red Sea has some of the finest coral and marine life in the world, and is easily accessible from the UK. Last Christmas my partner and I spent a blissful week in the <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413076,00.html\">Egyptian</a> resort of Na'ama Bay. Here you can simply walk into to sea from the beach and see spectacular fish and coral. Na'ama Bay is next to the larger (less attractive) resort of Sharm-el-Sheik, and there are direct flights to Sharm from the UK.</p> <p>The beach is lined with mainly luxury hotels, but there are parts of it which are accessible to everyone. Most people arrange a package with a travel agent which will take them to one of these hotels, but it is just as possible to travel independently - we took the bus there from Cairo and found a very nice hotel near the beach at a reasonable price. However many of the tour companies seem to offer good value packages. An added attraction is that some of the hotels have piers going out over the coral so that you can easily get into the water without touching any coral in the shallows. From these piers you are still in safe, shallow, warm water and can snorkel easily over the beautiful coral reef.<br>Anita Ball</p> <p>\u0095 Although you will still have to take a boat to get to the beach location, Dive Tulum (PADI registered) located near Tulum in <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413453,00.html\">Mexico</a>, provide escorted snorkelling trips which include snorkelling in a pool where an underground freshwater river meets the sea. The reef that lies just off the Carribean cost of Mexico is extensive, and sits close to the shore, but I would still recommend that you take a boat out to it. It really is no problem even for a very weak swimmer as the boat and other swimmers are always nearby. <br>Quentin North</p>",

You can swim over them straight off the beach, and from November to April if you swim under water you can hear whales singing. Dozens of humpback whales spend the winter in the bay and you can sit on the beach and watch then jumping. There are similar good snorkel spots all the way along this stretch and a turtle sanctuary at nearby Makena beach. Andy Simpson \u0095 The place to go is Sharm-el-Sheik on the Sinai peninsular in Egypt. I am 60, can just manage a width of the swimming pool provided I'm not at the deep end, and am too short sighted to see anyone more than a few feet away! There is a fringe reef round most of this coast and the sea is so salty that floating is especially easy. We found a beach close to our hotel where you go down some steps onto a manmade platform over the coral and then launch yourself into the sea off a ladder (just like going into a pool) and there you were, amongst the fish and within a yard of the coral! Magic! I found I could stay in the water for half an hour or so with no trouble. I concluded I'm a weak swimmer because I worry about not being able to breathe - the snorkelling tube eliminates that problem, and I really had a super time and would urge you to have a go. Tony Krarup \u0095 For snorkelling straight off the beach you can't beat the Coral View Resort in Pulau Besar, Perhentian Islands, Malaysia. The coral stacks right off the shore support hundreds of varieties of fish and an amazing range of animals from turtles to giant clams, and even black-tipped reef sharks (they're totally safe, honest, but guaranteed to cause palpitations on first viewing!) The Perentian Islands are off the north east coast of Malaysia, a 20-minute speedboat ride from close to Kota Bharu, and amazingly accessible from Kuala Lumpar or Singapore by train or even plane. Top tips for staying on Perhentian Besar are as follows. 1 Buy or borrow a mask, snorkel and flippers from a diving shop here in the UK before you go - you can hire them on the island but you'll want to be in the water for so long that the hire charges will work out more than the cost of purchase! 2 Buy a 'fish identification' sheet (one of the laminated ones) as you will want and need to know exactly what you have seen so you can brag about it for ages. 3 The islands are 'dry', so if it is important to you to have an evening bevvy, take your duty frees with you! 4 Stay at the Coral View Resort - it's got the best food, the best coral, excellent rooms, great staff, flying foxes and it's about \u00a315 per night for ensuite aircon chalets. Vicki May \u0095 It's a long way to go, but Kauai fits the bill perfectly. We spent a week there in September and found the snorkelling was actually better from the beach than from a boat. There are many spots to choose from.The best bet is to ask for advice in one of the snorkel hire shops when you arrive. Our favourite was Ke'e Beach, which is enclosed by coral apart from a narrow channel. You could swim among shoals of 3 foot long fish without getting out of your depth. Martin Thomas \u0095 Go to Villivaru Island in the Maldives which has it's own house reef a short foot-paddle from your beach bungalow. Wear a thin wetsuit for buoyancy, confidence and protection from the sun. Dave George \u0095 Last year we went from Mission Beach (Australia) to the coral reef. We were dropped on a small, beautiful sandbank, off an island, and I snorkelled over the reef from there. I am a weak swimmer but it was terrific. The skipper was environmentally sensitive and the whole trip - although it took a couple of hours to get to the reef - was friendly and enjoyable. Roger Sim \u0095 We discovered heavenly snorkelling for beginners in Curacao. I also hope that someone is going to suggest Rangali Island in the Maldives - we are about to go there for exactly that reason. Christine Bibby \u0095 You don't even need to swim at the Club Med in Moorea in the Pacific; simply wade out and poke your face into the water. Although they're small fry, you'll see lots of tropical fish. Our knees were even cleaned by a brilliant blue and black striped sucker fish! If you can swim about 10 metres further out, you may even see eels and tunafish. Another alternative (much more expensive) is Bird Island in the Seychelles. There is a protected lagoon on one side of the island. Although it doesn't have the coral that you'll find in Moorea, it's a beautiful place to visit. If you're a real landlubber, check out the giant land tortoise. And stay awake at least one night to watch the night sky, where you'll see constellations not visible from the Northern Hemisphere. Brilliant! John and Phyllis Murphy \u0095 We traveled to Jordan last year and had some wonderful snorkeling in Aqaba. We stayed at the Alcazar Hotel, which has its own beach club adjacent to the coral reefs in the Red Sea. The hotel arranges free transport to the club, which is about eight kilometres south of Aqaba. The facilities are very good with restaurant, swimming pool and showers and you can hire snorkelling equipment. There is direct access to the reef from the beach. Sue Banton \u0095There are several places along the Kenya coast where the reef is quite close to the beach. My favourite is Tiwi, about 20km south of Mombasa, where at low tide you can get to the reef almost without getting your feet wet by using a sand bank that joins the beach to the reef. At high tide you have to wade a bit! There are no hotels there, and no package holidays, which for me is a major plus point, but there is self-catering accommodation and it is very easy to organise a holiday there yourself. If you don't like the cooking or cleaning part of self-catering, it is possible to employ people to do this for you. Brian Thorogood \u0095 My friend and I class ourselves as wimps, so Coral Bay on the west coast of Australia was ideal for us to snorkel. You are able to walk from the shore to the reef where the sea is gentle and we never felt out of our depth. Our visit here was the first time either of us had snorkelled and for us it was by far the best place to do it in Australia. You can hire the gear for about A$12.00. The resort is unspoiled and friendly, the campsites are great (hostel not so good), and after a day under the sea the happy hour at the pub is particularly welcome. Angie Thompson \u0095 We highly recommend the Royal Diving Centre, a 10-minure drive south of Aqaba, in Jordan. Here there is a short jetty from which you can lower yourself into four or five feet of water, and then observe not only corals, but also some beautiful fish and other colourful marine life. Do beware of stonefish on the seabed, and the occasional lion fish, though! Jane and Pete, Bath. \u0095 The Red Sea has some of the finest coral and marine life in the world, and is easily accessible from the UK. Last Christmas my partner and I spent a blissful week in the Egyptian resort of Na'ama Bay. Here you can simply walk into to sea from the beach and see spectacular fish and coral. Na'ama Bay is next to the larger (less attractive) resort of Sharm-el-Sheik, and there are direct flights to Sharm from the UK. The beach is lined with mainly luxury hotels, but there are parts of it which are accessible to everyone. Most people arrange a package with a travel agent which will take them to one of these hotels, but it is just as possible to travel independently - we took the bus there from Cairo and found a very nice hotel near the beach at a reasonable price. However many of the tour companies seem to offer good value packages. An added attraction is that some of the hotels have piers going out over the coral so that you can easily get into the water without touching any coral in the shallows. From these piers you are still in safe, shallow, warm water and can snorkel easily over the beautiful coral reef. Anita Ball \u0095 Although you will still have to take a boat to get to the beach location, Dive Tulum (PADI registered) located near Tulum in Mexico, provide escorted snorkelling trips which include snorkelling in a pool where an underground freshwater river meets the sea. The reef that lies just off the Carribean cost of Mexico is extensive, and sits close to the shore, but I would still recommend that you take a boat out to it. It really is no problem even for a very weak swimmer as the boat and other swimmers are always nearby. Quentin North",

      "body": "<p>This week I say a sad goodbye to Asia and g'day Australia - a week spent enjoying more of Bali but ending with two missing days. First I must thank Gill for suggesting I go to Tirtagangga, where I spent a lovely few days. But my stay did not start too well. After visiting the water gardens where Bruce decided to be silly and hide among the statues, I went for a walk among the rice fields. I soon totally lost all sense of direction and found myself lost among tiny villages, surprising several women who were squatting in the dykes (no wonder the rice grows so well), I had forgotten the name of where I was staying and no one seemed to speak English. </p> <p>Eventually two little boys pointed me in the right direction which involved walking through the compound of a ferocious looking woman, who made no attempt to call off her equally ferocious dog that was snapping at my heels. </p> <p>Relieved to be back at the little restaurant at the losman (lodgings), the evening was spent with Jonathan, a young Canadian, two Japanese and the collection of young men who work there as guides, odd job men, taxi drivers and anything else they can think of to earn a dollar. They were lovely, anxious to improve their English and gain email contacts all over the world. The nearest computer was a 15-minute bus ride away - it was therapeutic to be away from them for a few days. </p> <p>I fixed with Made, one of the lads, to take me to the bottom of Mount Lempuyang the next morning. He duly arrived with motorbike and a tin helmet for me to wear. So suitably saronged and helmeted (removed for the photo as I looked like a first world war soldier) I set off to the temple, Pura Telaga Mas, at the bottom of the mountain, arranging to be picked up four and a half hours later. The whole of Bali was preparing for a big festival in a few days and ceremonies were already underway. I climbed the stairs to the temple but was almost frogmarched back down by two official looking men in white. I was afraid I had committed some cultural faux pas, but no, they merely wanted me to take their photograph. Seeing the result in the back screen they were obviously not happy because they marched back in position for me to take another. </p> <p>It was then a half hour walk up a very steep hill to reach the 1,700 steps that led up the mountain to the Pura Lempuyang Luhur at the top. This is one of the important directional temples of Bali that protect the island. I had flashbacks to my Nepal trek as my lungs and knees protested. There was a lot of sign-language mutual support as the local people struggled up too, some with small children or carrying large loads on their heads. I did not see another tourist all day. </p> <p>The guide book had promised the most spectacular views of Bali and the huge volcano, Gunung Agung, but half way up we entered the clouds and the view from the top was white nothingness in every direction. </p> <p>Back at the lower temple I rested, listening to the music, watching the men build shelters from bamboo and rushes and was invited to sit with the young men and girls all busy making offerings for the ceremonies. So no view, but an enjoyable experience, meeting the ordinary people of Bali, all in their best sarongs, everyone cheerful and nobody trying to sell you anything.</p> <p>That evening in my losman there was a show of music, singing and dancing. Very different from the polished performances of Ubud, this was 15 men and boys from the village singing traditional songs. As the arak - the local spirit - flowed freely, they dragged up members of the audience to dance. My camera remained firmly zipped in its case. As I sat on my veranda afterwards I wished I could have recorded the sounds of the night here - a cacophony of bull frogs, cicada and various other twitterings. The morning sounds are less welcome, the dawn crowing of all the roosters that everyone in Bali keeps for their favourite sport - cockfighting. </p> <p>Not wanting to make the same mistake twice, next morning I hired Made as my guide for a two-hour walk. We went through paddy fields and up a hill with a wonderful view of the mountain I had climbed. Bruce and I were impressed with our achievement. Made took me to his simple village with clay brick walls and rush roofs, showed me all the cooking equipment in the kitchen and his family temple. He asked if I wanted a swim in the dyke, but after what I had witnessed before and the fact that we were standing by a man washing his cows, I declined. </p> <p>On Monday it was time to head off to Lovina in the north. Lovina has a black beach of volcanic sand. I booked into a lovely place with a swimming pool. Eating out that night with Jessica whom I had met on the bus, I mentioned catching my plane on Friday night to be in Darwin on the 1st. She assured me that the 1st was in fact Thursday, making my flight Wednesday night, and that Wednesday was a public holiday with no buses. Instant panic and bewilderment as to how I had lost two days somewhere. My big bag was still in Ubud, but luckily there was a bus going to Kuta and then on to Ubud at lunchtime the next day. So, not to be outdone by Sam, that left me just about time to do the dolphin trip at 6am the next morning. </p> <p>This was a strange experience with a flotilla of small catamarans all charging about after any sightings of the dolphins half an hour or so out to sea. We did glimpse a couple in the distance, the flotilla broke up and we seemed to be heading back. But I was pleasantly wrong as with a few other boats we spent another hour in a different spot following a group of dolphins who then met up with others making a pod of 20 or so. They delighted us with their diving, a couple of show-offs doing fancy somersaults. Trying to catch them on camera was difficult as they seemed to dive under water every time I was ready, I was terribly excited when I eventually did get a shot. Presumably the dolphins could leave the boats well behind if they wanted to - I hope they do not mind this daily game of chase. </p> <p>So it was virtually hello goodbye Lovina and back to Ubud for the evening. Time to negotiate an extortionate fee for a lift to the airport the following evening. Wednesday saw the whole of Bali dressed up for the first day of the Galungan Festival. All the streets were lined with 'penjor' - tall tapering bamboo poles intricately decorated and each with a box of offerings of fruit and food at the base. The family of the homestay where I was staying showed me their family temple with tall piles of fruit and other gifts. The children of my street gathered to dress up in a Barong costume and toured the streets with drums and gongs dancing for a small offering of money. I was sad to leave Bali, barely having seen half of the island. The more time I spent there the more I appreciated its unique talented people, and that it is much more than a tourist trap. </p> <p>So yesterday, at 6am I arrived in Darwin and checked in to the YHA. The pampered youth of today - a YHA with a swimming pool - what happened to the cold showers and rota of chores of the hostelling days of my youth? The only minus is that the room smells awful - a mould, wet towels mixed with sweat smell - ugh. I questioned the receptionist who said all the rooms are the same, it is the humidity. I will stick it tonight as I am off to Kakadu tomorrow. </p> <p>I have spent the day organising myself - swapping my Darwin to Sydney flight for Alice Springs to Cairns and buying an extra flight Cairns to Sydney, booking a four-day tour to Kakadu and another six-day trip to Ayres Rock (Uluru) and Alice Springs. </p> <p>I decided to go the more popular south and east route as it is still very much the wet season and there are not many notices for car shares around. This is going to be an expensive month, tours seem to be the only option as I do not dare drive all the vast distances on my own. It will be a bit strange to be in groups after so long travelling alone. I'll let you know how I get on. It will also be strictly hostels here as accommodation is much dearer than I have been used to. No worries. G'day to you all.<br>Sue</p>",

      "body": "<p>Thursday is payday for me, woohoo! It somehow makes all the crazy hours worthwhile. Breakfast shift that morning was easy and I would almost say fun - we were done, cleared and out by 1pm, giving me a chance to enjoy the afternoon sun. Late afternoon I headed to Darling Harbour to see Jennifer Lopez (or J Lo as she calls herself) promoting her new album. I don't know why I didn't think many people would be there - in fact it came as a shock that crowds in their thousands had been waiting all day just to catch a glimpse of her as she did a mass autograph signing. I didn't stay long - staring at a celebrity doesn't really keep me happy for long, though she is as gorgeous as everybody makes out. </p> <p>In last week's report I claimed I'd had my longest day ever. Well, Friday is a new record - and I don't think this one will be beaten. . . It began with a bus journey at 3.43am. Now the only time I've been awake that early before is because I'm yet to go to sleep - this isn't when normal people head off for work. Having somehow dragged my body through a morning of serving breakfast to a Japanese crowd I then had two hours' break before I started my next shift of the day - just enough time to curl up and sleep in the staff restaurant. The evening shift was for the same Japanese group, only they were quite different to how they had been that morning. I had the unfortunate job of handling beverages - unfortunate because they all went wild. There really were some big drinkers there, though at least it kept me busy. </p> <p>There was a Beatles cover band - The Beatels - for their party, which was brilliant as I got to bop along to their tunes while I was working - one of my many job perks. I managed to get away at 1.15am, which meant I'd had a 17 hour working day, which is pretty impressive. More impressive was how I managed to stay in the pub for four hours after that (to celebrate still being alive). I returned home tired, less than sober, and over 24 hours later than I'd left. I think that day is going to take some beating. </p> <p>On Saturday, unsurprisingly I found that moving had become a tricky task. Somehow I managed to leave my welcoming bed and return to the city for my evening at work (it really has become my second home). The function was an extravagant American do where the whole room had been decked out in underwater scenery complete with blue-painted dancers. It was another entertaining shift, especially near the end when they requested all staff to parade in wearing sombreros and carrying trays of tequila. A good night, and I even got to take home a ridiculously oversized flower arrangement which is now sitting on top of the telly in my room, making it look at least a bit homely. </p> <p>The next day was my day off, and I was walking down the main Coogee Road when I met a guy who I've been at school with since I was five years old. I knew he was in the area so it wasn't a total shock to see him, but I still found it bizarre. We spent the afternoon chatting about travelling - which I find a lot of my conversations are about, and soon realised how surprisingly normal it was despite being the other side of the world. Having nothing better to do that evening, I went with Brian to a short film festival in the Domain. It turned out to be enormous - Tropfset no.9 - with a crowd of 85,000 gathered to watch. The evening was broadcast around the world and involved watching and then choosing winners from 16 films all less than seven minutes long. </p> <p>There were some brilliant entrants - the winner was a tale of a man attempting to light a cigarette while driving, (I won't spoil the ending!) and I was incredibly glad I went. The next day I spent the whole day on the beach - which is incredibly lazy but felt wonderful so I'm not going to feel bad about it. In the evening me and Brian felt charged up for a second go at the pub quiz in Bondi. This time I thought we were even worse than before and neither of us could believe our ears when we eventually came in second - and were rewarded with two huge crates of beer for our troubles! </p> <p>Must still have something happening up there after all these months of not studying then. Tuesday morning my alarm woke me at 5am again which only ever means one thing. Still, I found it pretty easy to wake up after my two day's rest and I promised myself to have time off more often. That shouldn't be a hard one to keep. Work was dull, but that didn't bother me as I was looking forward to the imminent arrival of my Mum. </p> <p>That afternoon I booked a few surprises for her which I can't write just in case she reads this, but you'll see in good time. I celebrated my successful day's work with beer from last night and cheesecake.

      "bodyText": "Thursday is payday for me, woohoo! It somehow makes all the crazy hours worthwhile. Breakfast shift that morning was easy and I would almost say fun - we were done, cleared and out by 1pm, giving me a chance to enjoy the afternoon sun. Late afternoon I headed to Darling Harbour to see Jennifer Lopez (or J Lo as she calls herself) promoting her new album. I don't know why I didn't think many people would be there - in fact it came as a shock that crowds in their thousands had been waiting all day just to catch a glimpse of her as she did a mass autograph signing. I didn't stay long - staring at a celebrity doesn't really keep me happy for long, though she is as gorgeous as everybody makes out. In last week's report I claimed I'd had my longest day ever. Well, Friday is a new record - and I don't think this one will be beaten. . . It began with a bus journey at 3.43am. Now the only time I've been awake that early before is because I'm yet to go to sleep - this isn't when normal people head off for work. Having somehow dragged my body through a morning of serving breakfast to a Japanese crowd I then had two hours' break before I started my next shift of the day - just enough time to curl up and sleep in the staff restaurant. The evening shift was for the same Japanese group, only they were quite different to how they had been that morning. I had the unfortunate job of handling beverages - unfortunate because they all went wild. There really were some big drinkers there, though at least it kept me busy. There was a Beatles cover band - The Beatels - for their party, which was brilliant as I got to bop along to their tunes while I was working - one of my many job perks. I managed to get away at 1.15am, which meant I'd had a 17 hour working day, which is pretty impressive. More impressive was how I managed to stay in the pub for four hours after that (to celebrate still being alive). I returned home tired, less than sober, and over 24 hours later than I'd left. I think that day is going to take some beating. On Saturday, unsurprisingly I found that moving had become a tricky task. Somehow I managed to leave my welcoming bed and return to the city for my evening at work (it really has become my second home). The function was an extravagant American do where the whole room had been decked out in underwater scenery complete with blue-painted dancers. It was another entertaining shift, especially near the end when they requested all staff to parade in wearing sombreros and carrying trays of tequila. A good night, and I even got to take home a ridiculously oversized flower arrangement which is now sitting on top of the telly in my room, making it look at least a bit homely. The next day was my day off, and I was walking down the main Coogee Road when I met a guy who I've been at school with since I was five years old. I knew he was in the area so it wasn't a total shock to see him, but I still found it bizarre. We spent the afternoon chatting about travelling - which I find a lot of my conversations are about, and soon realised how surprisingly normal it was despite being the other side of the world. Having nothing better to do that evening, I went with Brian to a short film festival in the Domain. It turned out to be enormous - Tropfset no.9 - with a crowd of 85,000 gathered to watch. The evening was broadcast around the world and involved watching and then choosing winners from 16 films all less than seven minutes long. There were some brilliant entrants - the winner was a tale of a man attempting to light a cigarette while driving, (I won't spoil the ending!) and I was incredibly glad I went. The next day I spent the whole day on the beach - which is incredibly lazy but felt wonderful so I'm not going to feel bad about it. In the evening me and Brian felt charged up for a second go at the pub quiz in Bondi. This time I thought we were even worse than before and neither of us could believe our ears when we eventually came in second - and were rewarded with two huge crates of beer for our troubles! Must still have something happening up there after all these months of not studying then. Tuesday morning my alarm woke me at 5am again which only ever means one thing. Still, I found it pretty easy to wake up after my two day's rest and I promised myself to have time off more often. That shouldn't be a hard one to keep. Work was dull, but that didn't bother me as I was looking forward to the imminent arrival of my Mum. That afternoon I booked a few surprises for her which I can't write just in case she reads this, but you'll see in good time. I celebrated my successful day's work with beer from last night and cheesecake. I picked my mum up from the airport the next night and it was great to see her again - several other travellers had told me how jealous they were! It also brought home how quickly my first three months of travelling have gone by. That evening we just walked round Coogee and had a dinner in her hotel - which is gorgeous. There was lots to catch up on and I didn't want to make her too jet-lagged. After all, I do have those surprises and I want her to be awake for them. . .

But unity on the left is still tricky. Arthur Scargill, standing in Hartlepool for his Socialist Labour party, will not answer their letters, but despite that, in a brotherly gesture the Alliance will not put up a candidate against him (and Peter Mandelson). The first questioner to leap to her feet at the press conference was from Worker's Tannoy, demanding to know why the Socialist Alliance had supported Ken Livingstone, \"who is not a socialist!\" Next up was someone demanding to know whether Socialist Alliance had abandoned Troops Out of Ireland and revolution as the path to socialism? Nellist was evasive on both, saying they hadn't quite decided yet, but he'd let her know. \"Oh, I see, answer's in the post, eh?\" she snorted.

Take a blank piece of paper, think blue sky and green field and dream of a world that is a better place than this, unfallen angels in an Eden of goodness where all manner of things shall be well. Every child and adult will be immediately lifted out of poverty, benefits will be restored to 16-year-olds, pensioners will not be means tested so all get the minimum income guarantee, free nurseries and childcare for all, rail and buses renationalised, abolish the monarchy, legalise cannabis, open the borders to free immigration, abandon Nato and the European Union, increase foreign aid, bring in a 35-hour week, a minimum wage of \u00a37 an hour, abolish private schools, free breakfast and lunch for all children, free grants for all students, freeze council rents, renationalise water and make it free and a whole lot more besides.</p> <p>How will it be paid for? There was some confusion about whether or not the budget was included in the press pack. (It wasn't, it would be following in a few days.)

There are plenty of MPs and indeed some ministers in peril of losing their seats where Alliance intervention might be a killer. By Whiteley's calculation, some 52 Labour MPs stand to lose through Labour voters' apathy. It may be better to hope the young might at least vote Alliance than not vote at all.

But if they had sat listening yesterday to the trashing of Labour's achievements, they would spit with fury. What did Labour (the Romans) ever do for us? A lot, and a lot more to come. How dare Dave Nellist and Mark Steel talk of \"Labour cuts\" just as more money than ever before comes on stream? They are quite wrong to suggest Labour's heart is not with the poor, when all the first money has poured towards them - pensioners, children, minimum wage and all. In fact the more vigorously the Alliance campaigns, the better it may be for Labour, so unjust and outrageous is their refusal to admit Labour is one iota better than the Tories.</p> <p>Critical friends have a hard time steering between admiration for New Labour's success and urging it on to do better. Militant et al represent the politics of 18 years of failure, but that does not mean that every one of their policies is unthinkable. Look at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and the Fabians, Labour's two closest think-tanks - sane, wise and clever political realists. Both are now pressing Labour to be bolder, more radical - yes, more leftwing in a modern context. The Fabian's great tome on tax and spending, the result of long deliberation by a commission chaired by Lord Plant, came up with excellent plans for a fair wealth tax and higher income tax for earnings over \u00a3100,000. It does not take raving loony lefties to propose such a thing, for the IPPR also wants the rich taxed more in national insurance and pension perks.</p> <p>The IPPR has just produced its own manifesto calling for a \"more ambitious agenda\" for the next election, questioning why one of the most prosperous countries in the world is still so un equal, something the government ducks. Quality of life is the true measure of a successful society, not mere economic progress, they say. They call for turning Railtrack into a non-profit trust, reducing prison numbers, proportional representation to re-engage voters, a new deal for refugees and work/life balance rights.</p> <p>None of this is wild stuff. This is the new boldness of Labour party thinkers realising that in a strong second term, a great leap forward is now thinkable. There is an important difference between Labour's sworn enemies and its friends who sometimes criticise its timidity and lack of ambition.

      "bodyText": "Islamic groups yesterday responded angrily to the government's decision to brand 21 organisations as terrorist under a new act which for the first time enables the home secretary to proscribe those targeting foreign states. More than half the 21 groups on the list of banned groups, announced on Wednesday, are of Muslim origin, though it also included the Kurdistan Workers Party (the PKK), which has thousands of supporters in Britain. The London-based Islamic Human Rights Commission complained that Britain was effectively siding with friendly or \"occupying regimes\" responsible for oppression of Muslim populations. \"Struggles in Palestine and Kashmir, for instance, are undertaken by the indigenous population against illegal occupation. International law accepts that such struggles are perfectly just,\" said Massoud Shadjareh, the group's chairman. Yasser al-Serri, an Egyptian who runs the London-based Islamic Observation Centre, said the act would \"poison relations between Britain and Islamists\". Kurdish spokesmen who asked not to be identified criticised the inclusion on the list of the PKK. The act defines terrorism as \"the use or threat of action\", including serious violence against property in Britain or abroad, to advance a political, religious or ideological cause. It also includes a new offence of \"incitement\". Critics of the measure, including the civil rights group Liberty, claim it is so draconian as to make it an offence to help to organise a meeting to be addressed by someone who professes to belong to a proscribed organisation, even if the person is not really a member, and says nothing about the organisation. Charles Clarke, the Home Office minister, said that what action might be taken against the proscribed groups was up to the police. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: \"We must ensure that decisions to ban organisations take fully into account their democratic aims.\"",

      "bodyText": "Labour's high command is attempting to disrupt Tory election preparations by allowing MPs in Britain's most marginal constituencies to skip votes at Westminster, forcing the Conservatives to divert resources away from more needy seats. MPs in Labour's 30 most marginal seats have been ordered to increase their profiles in their constituencies to spread fear among their Tory opponents who are largely being left to their own devices by Central Office. Labour strategists issued the orders after discovering that Conservative Central Office is putting comparatively few resources into the 30 most marginal seats, assuming that they should bounce back to the party. Such constituencies have been classified by the Tories as \"stand alone\" seats. The new Labour strategy became clear in recent weeks when the government's majority fell noticeably in a series of Commons votes. MPs in former Tory strongholds, such as Kettering and Gillingham, which the Tories will win back on a swing of less than 2%, have been told to attend high-profile events in their constituencies. The disclosure of Labour's latest spoiling tactic highlighted renewed confidence at Millbank in the face of dire Tory poll results. An ICM poll for yesterday's London Evening Standard showed that Labour has jumped to a 24-point lead in the capital, representing a three point swing since the last general election. Labour stands at 52% in London, up three points on 1997, with the Tories on 28%, down three, and the Liberal Democrats staying on 15%. The Conservatives' poor poll results will cast a shadow over the party's spring conference which begins in Harrogate today.

      "body": "<p>The noble portals of the St Ermine's hotel, a stone's throw from the Palace of Westminster, have witnessed much of the tug of war on the left over the past few decades. Yesterday, inappropriately renamed the Jolly St Ermine's, it played host to a voice from yesteryear - Dave Nellist, former Militant Labour MP, now Socialist Alliance chair, launching their general election campaign. It was he, in his wry and charming way, who referred to this as the spot where rightwing Labour plotters used to gather two decades ago - the founders of the social democratic party, splitters on the other side. (Like me.)</p> <p>This coalition of Militant and the Socialist Workers party is putting up 100 candidates in England and Wales, one in all 72 Scottish seats, enough to guarantee them a party political broadcast. But unity on the left is still tricky. Arthur Scargill, standing in Hartlepool for his Socialist Labour party, will not answer their letters, but despite that, in a brotherly gesture the Alliance will not put up a candidate against him (and Peter Mandelson). The first questioner to leap to her feet at the press conference was from Worker's Tannoy, demanding to know why the Socialist Alliance had supported Ken Livingstone, \"who is not a socialist!\" Next up was someone demanding to know whether Socialist Alliance had abandoned Troops Out of Ireland and revolution as the path to socialism? Nellist was evasive on both, saying they hadn't quite decided yet, but he'd let her know. \"Oh, I see, answer's in the post, eh?\" she snorted. Those too young to remember scenes such as these from the 70s and 80s might get the general flavour from the Judaean People's Liberation Front in The Life of Brian.

      "bodyText": "The noble portals of the St Ermine's hotel, a stone's throw from the Palace of Westminster, have witnessed much of the tug of war on the left over the past few decades. Yesterday, inappropriately renamed the Jolly St Ermine's, it played host to a voice from yesteryear - Dave Nellist, former Militant Labour MP, now Socialist Alliance chair, launching their general election campaign. It was he, in his wry and charming way, who referred to this as the spot where rightwing Labour plotters used to gather two decades ago - the founders of the social democratic party, splitters on the other side. (Like me.) This coalition of Militant and the Socialist Workers party is putting up 100 candidates in England and Wales, one in all 72 Scottish seats, enough to guarantee them a party political broadcast. But unity on the left is still tricky. Arthur Scargill, standing in Hartlepool for his Socialist Labour party, will not answer their letters, but despite that, in a brotherly gesture the Alliance will not put up a candidate against him (and Peter Mandelson). The first questioner to leap to her feet at the press conference was from Worker's Tannoy, demanding to know why the Socialist Alliance had supported Ken Livingstone, \"who is not a socialist!\" Next up was someone demanding to know whether Socialist Alliance had abandoned Troops Out of Ireland and revolution as the path to socialism? Nellist was evasive on both, saying they hadn't quite decided yet, but he'd let her know. \"Oh, I see, answer's in the post, eh?\" she snorted. Those too young to remember scenes such as these from the 70s and 80s might get the general flavour from the Judaean People's Liberation Front in The Life of Brian. (We will come to what the Romans did for us later.) Their policies? Take a blank piece of paper, think blue sky and green field and dream of a world that is a better place than this, unfallen angels in an Eden of goodness where all manner of things shall be well. Every child and adult will be immediately lifted out of poverty, benefits will be restored to 16-year-olds, pensioners will not be means tested so all get the minimum income guarantee, free nurseries and childcare for all, rail and buses renationalised, abolish the monarchy, legalise cannabis, open the borders to free immigration, abandon Nato and the European Union, increase foreign aid, bring in a 35-hour week, a minimum wage of \u00a37 an hour, abolish private schools, free breakfast and lunch for all children, free grants for all students, freeze council rents, renationalise water and make it free and a whole lot more besides.

      "bodyText": "Britain last night expressed growing anger at the government of Zimbabwe by announcing the withdrawal of a peacekeeper training team at the end of this month. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, increased pressure on President Robert Mugabe as tension rose in Zimbabwe over the plight of the chief justice, Anthony Gubbay. Mr Cook expressed concern at the \"deteriorating situation\" in Zimbabwe, which expelled two foreign journalists last week. Meanwhile, Mr Gubbay, 68, defied a government deadline to quit yesterday, throwing into disarray Mr Mugabe's attempts to purge the courts of judges who ruled against his seizure of white-owned farms. He arrived at his supreme court office despite government claims that he had already been replaced by a Mugabe supporter. The justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, claimed his defiance made no difference. \"We now refer to him as former chief justice,\" he said. \"If he embarks on any games, which I believe he is trying to do, he only has himself to blame ... He is disrespectful and not worthy of being a chief justice.\" The information minister, Jonathan Moyo, said Mr Gubbay would be dealt with \"in a humane way\". Mr Gubbay and other supreme court judges have been under pressure to quit - with open threats to their safety - since handing down a series of rulings declaring the wholesale occupation of white-owned farms illegal. Mr Gubbay made no comment yesterday but his lawyers said he would resist any attempt to remove him or bring him before a tribunal. \"Any attempt to force our client to vacate his chambers or house will be challenged. There is no basis to appoint a tribunal and any such action will be challenged by our client,\" they said. The justice minister told parliament on Wednesday that a former attorney general and prominent Mugabe supporter, Godfrey Chikausikyu, would shortly be sworn in to replace Mr Gubbay. The government wants Mr Chikausikyu to oversee a disciplinary panel it intends to use to dismiss other senior judges it accuses of having a \"Rhodesian mindset\". As the crisis over land reform and Mr Mugabe's resistance to growing opposition has escalated, Britain has suspended help with the land reform programme, switched aid to non-governmental organisations and ended sales of parts for military aircraft. This week the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, returned from Zimbabwe demanding its suspension from the Commonwealth and a freeze on assets.",

      "bodyText": "Sources close to John Prescott insisted last night that the deputy prime minister had gone to the \"outer limit\" of compromise over the London tube, after the board of Ken Livingstone's Transport for London body authorised a legal challenge to his plans for partial selloff. The decision to allow the transport commissioner, Bob Kiley, to seek judicial review, which was moved by the Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer and backed unanimously by board members, is likely to be activated in the next few days unless agreement can be reached with the government. Legal advice to Transport for London, which was set up to run the city's bus and underground system, suggests that the challenge has \"good prospects of success\" and should be pursued \"as soon as possible\". But government sources countered last night that legal action would only delay necessary investment in the fast-deteriorating tube network, and said that Mr Kiley, who is seeking \"unified management control\", would \"have to make his mind up\". The government confirmed that a package of concessions over its scheme to break up and partially privatise the tube was a formal offer, but it has already been rejected by Mr Kiley as failing to meet his central objective. Mr Prescott is offering Mr Kiley a special share with veto rights in the private companies due to be awarded 30-year contracts to run track, signalling and stations; a power of direction over the companies' order of work; and a right of veto over their chief executives and key managers. A final concession would make half the members of their boards \"partnership directors\" with legal public interest responsibilities, a quarter to be appointed by Mr Kiley and a quarter by the private consortiums - the other half, made up of ordinary directors, would also be appointed by the consortiums.",

There is a skyscraper of evidence to show the link between poverty and educational attainment. (One taste: at the age of 22 months, children from affluent families are already 14% higher up the educational-development distribution than children from poor families.)</p> <p>And the most important single statistic in contemporary Britain is this: when the Tories came to power in 1979, 7% of our children lived in poverty; by the time they left in 1997, that figure had risen to 30%. One-third of our children! And they are all supposed to go to school.</p> <p>You have to understand that this poverty is not just about material hardship. Those children are growing up in communities that have collapsed, families that have broken; more than any other social class, they are exposed to drug abuse, alcohol abuse and to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Miraculously, many of them survive. But a great many of them are deeply damaged and turn up in class with all kinds of emotional and behavioural disorders.</p> <p>The next crucial part of the bigger picture is that the effects of that poverty on schools have been enormously aggravated by the reforms which were introduced by Kenneth Baker in 1989. This is a complicated story, but essentially, he set up a market in school places, and that market has created a terrifying polarisation. Schools with an intake of well motivated, middle-class children do well in the league tables and attract extra children who bring extra funds with them. Schools with an intake of troubled poor children struggle in the league tables, lose children and lose money. It is these schools with a concentration of damaged children which are held up as failures.</p> <p>When Mr Woodhead then blames \"trendy teachers\" for that failure, he inflicts a gross injustice on those teachers who have survived a 20-year purge of a kind unseen in any other profession. But, more than that, he uses the power of his position to collude in the camouflaging of the truth. With the energetic support of newspapers like the Daily Telegraph, this entirely bogus analysis has been used to generate a set of entirely bogus solutions.</p> <p>Confronted now with the abject failure of schemes such as special measures and Fresh Start, Mr Woodhead might have admitted his fault. But no. Perhaps he feels too trapped by his history of bold error to turn back. Perhaps he is simply an extremely brittle personality, driven more by anger than by reason. Whatever the explanation, he clings to his illusions and now attacks Mr Blunkett on the basis that all would have been well if only Mr Blunkett had been even more extreme in building on Mr Woodhead's flawed foundations.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett should ignore him. Which is not to say that the education secretary should not be attacked. Indeed, he should be hounded around the clock from the opposite point of view - for his cowardly refusal to take on the political battle which had to be fought to reverse Baker's market-driven reforms and put our education system back on to a rational footing. It may well be that he knows that what he is doing is wrong. That is not enough. It leaves the rest of us in the deeply uncomfortable position of watching a debate in which we are invited to choose between a liar and a fool.</p> <p>\u0095 The School Report by Nick Davies, is published by Vintage, \u00a3 6.99.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

And the most important single statistic in contemporary Britain is this: when the Tories came to power in 1979, 7% of our children lived in poverty; by the time they left in 1997, that figure had risen to 30%. One-third of our children! And they are all supposed to go to school. You have to understand that this poverty is not just about material hardship. Those children are growing up in communities that have collapsed, families that have broken; more than any other social class, they are exposed to drug abuse, alcohol abuse and to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Miraculously, many of them survive. But a great many of them are deeply damaged and turn up in class with all kinds of emotional and behavioural disorders. The next crucial part of the bigger picture is that the effects of that poverty on schools have been enormously aggravated by the reforms which were introduced by Kenneth Baker in 1989. This is a complicated story, but essentially, he set up a market in school places, and that market has created a terrifying polarisation. Schools with an intake of well motivated, middle-class children do well in the league tables and attract extra children who bring extra funds with them. Schools with an intake of troubled poor children struggle in the league tables, lose children and lose money. It is these schools with a concentration of damaged children which are held up as failures. When Mr Woodhead then blames \"trendy teachers\" for that failure, he inflicts a gross injustice on those teachers who have survived a 20-year purge of a kind unseen in any other profession. But, more than that, he uses the power of his position to collude in the camouflaging of the truth. With the energetic support of newspapers like the Daily Telegraph, this entirely bogus analysis has been used to generate a set of entirely bogus solutions. Confronted now with the abject failure of schemes such as special measures and Fresh Start, Mr Woodhead might have admitted his fault. But no. Perhaps he feels too trapped by his history of bold error to turn back. Perhaps he is simply an extremely brittle personality, driven more by anger than by reason. Whatever the explanation, he clings to his illusions and now attacks Mr Blunkett on the basis that all would have been well if only Mr Blunkett had been even more extreme in building on Mr Woodhead's flawed foundations. Mr Blunkett should ignore him. Which is not to say that the education secretary should not be attacked. Indeed, he should be hounded around the clock from the opposite point of view - for his cowardly refusal to take on the political battle which had to be fought to reverse Baker's market-driven reforms and put our education system back on to a rational footing. It may well be that he knows that what he is doing is wrong. That is not enough. It leaves the rest of us in the deeply uncomfortable position of watching a debate in which we are invited to choose between a liar and a fool. \u0095 The School Report by Nick Davies, is published by Vintage, \u00a3 6.99. comment@theguardian.com",

Evidence collected from 876 secondary schools - about a quarter of the total - reveals there were 2,410 vacancies for permanent teachers last month. Across the secondary sector that would mean 9,969 unfilled posts. A similar survey last September concluded there were 4,000 posts unfilled. According to the analysis, carried out by the Secondary Heads Association and Times Educational Supplement, the most serious problems are still in London and the south-east, but the situation is also worse than before in the midlands and the north-east. John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"For too long the government has underplayed the extent of the teacher recruitment crisis.\" The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said that at least 20,000 temporary vacancies in England and Wales remained unfilled every week because of a lack of supply teachers. This week the two biggest teaching unions, the National Union of Teachers and the National Association of School Masters Union of Women Teachers, announced they would refuse to cover unfilled, permanent posts and staff absences of longer than three days in London and Doncaster after strike ballots. \"This survey shows the true depth of the crisis facing our schools,\" said Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesman. David Blunkett, the education secretary, told the TES: \"The word crisis is the kind of word you use when you have foot and mouth disease destroying an industry. \"It is not a word that you use when you want to resolve a problem by recruiting or bringing back more professionals. \"",

Education action zones Described as \"educational test beds\" to encourage innovation through partnerships between local education authorities, businesses and parents, the scheme was designed to provide imaginative approaches to raising standards in disadvantaged urban and rural areas. Each zone typically includes a cluster of two or three secondary schools with their supporting primaries and special educational needs provision. Since September 1999, 73 \"large\" zones have been set up, where results for 11-year-olds have improved by more than the national average and rates of truancy have gone down.

By September it is expected to cover a third of all secondary pupils in 1,000 schools. Already schools in EiC areas have shown faster improvement than schools elsewhere, in terms of the proportion of pupils achieving 5 or more A* to C grade GCSEs and those getting at least one GCSE.

Key to the scheme is a programme for \"gifted and talented\" pupils, which provides extra resources, such as summer schools, to allow them to fulfil their potential. National grid for learning Launched in late 1998, the NGfL was created to become the national focal point for learning on the internet, and a resource for all schools in England. The challenge was to boost the use of information and communications technology (ICT) in primary schools, where four years ago fewer than 20% were connected to the internet. Now that figure is 86% (98% in secondary schools), with improved ratios of one computer to every 13 pupils. By next year, over \u00a3650m will have been spent in equipping and networking schools.

Labour are clueless, vote Conservative\"; \"Day 6. William Hague, untrammelled genius\"; \"Day 10. Why I would be bloody brilliant in the House of Lords\"; \"Day 99. 'Ere guv, I once had that Prince Charles in the back of my cab\". The articles are designed to inflict damage on Labour, but I doubt that they will. Who wants to read indefinitely about a saint surrounded by fools? After an initial flurry interest will subside, only resurfacing briefly if our hero becomes Screaming Lord Woodhead and enters the political arena. \u0095 Ted Wragg is professor of education at the University of Exeter comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s hard to imagine two of Hollywood\u2019s most admired actors running into trouble with the police for slapping up posters of their latest film in the middle of the night. But that was the only way that John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands could rustle up interest in the films that were shunned by the mainstream industry.</p> <p>John Cassavetes died in 1989 at the age of 59, still battling to get his films shown because he was still the maverick, edgy director whose work people either loved and treasured as part of the canon of great American cinema or hated and mocked as self-indulgent ramblings. Now the National Film Theatre is screening all of his films, from the very first, Shadows, made for next to nothing in 1961, through his best-known work such as the award-winning A Woman Under the Influence in 1974 and The Killing of a Chinese Bookie in 1976. A new generation who may never have had a chance to see his work on a cinema screen will now be able to judge for themselves.</p> <p>Posters for two of his films, Gloria and Love Streams, hang on either side of the log fire in the home he shared with Gena Rowlands high in the Hollywood Hills, a home that doubled as their studio. Other posters, small works of art in themselves, frame the door to the sitting room where Rowlands is talking about her late husband\u2019s work. \u201cThese were in John\u2019s office when he died and I was going to put them in storage and then I thought no - heck, that\u2019s our whole life there - I\u2019m going to put it up so I can be reminded of it. Looks dangerously like Sunset Boulevard...\u201d</p> <p>When people mention Cassavetes\u2019s work they refer to him mainly as the great improviser, a misconception with which Gena Rowlands is familiar. \u201cMany people feel that all of John\u2019s scripts were improvised and that just isn\u2019t true. There are a lot of different opinions of what improvisation means - a lot of people think it means you just say anything you want to, whereas usually it\u2019s based on a storyline: you know what the thrust of the scene is, then it\u2019s rehearsed and turned into something. That is the way they worked in Shadows. When John screened it for the first time he didn\u2019t like part of it so he went back and shot some more. I think he would have kept reshooting and editing for the rest of his life!\u201d</p> <p>A Woman Under the Influence, widely regarded as Cassavetes\u2019 finest film, won an Oscar nomination for him as best director and for Rowlands for her haunting portrayal of a woman on the very edge. \u201cThat was totally scripted. John had written it as a play - he wrote two plays and they were both wonderful - but I said: \u2018John, I would be dead in two weeks if I played this on stage every night.\u2019 So he said: \u2018I\u2019ll put it into a movie.\u2019 And that\u2019s what he did.\u201d But while the cast may have been working from a script, there was always room for their own improvisations, whether it was Seymour Cassel riffing in Faces (1968) or Ben Gazzara, Peter Falk and Cassavetes rambling drunkenly in Husbands (1970). So how did the actors feel about working in that way? \u201cPeter [Falk, along with Rowlands, Cassel and Gazzara, part of the loyal Cassavetes ensemble] was a little hesitant at the beginning. Peter used to say: \u2018I dunno, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u2019 Then he saw the results and he became a believer.\u201d</p> <p>Esme Chandlee, who has worked as a publicist with Rowlands and Cassavetes since the early days, is sitting in on the interview on this oddly grey LA afternoon. She recalls that Joan Blondell, one of the great names of old Hollywood who played a playwright in Opening Night not long before she died, was also initially puzzled by Cassavetes\u2019 way of working. \u201cShe had been brought up in the studio system and she said: \u2018You know, Esme, I have never worked this way before. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing the right thing.\u2019 I said: \u2018Whatever you feel is right, just talk to John about it and that will be that.\u2019 About a week later, she said: \u2018I feel so free, everything I ask him, he listens. I never had an experience like this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt takes a while to get used to freedom,\u201d says Rowlands, who was a successful actress before participating in her husband\u2019s films. Cassavetes had made his name playing the title role in the television detective series Johnny Staccato and went on to act in nearly 30 films including Rosemary\u2019s Baby and The Dirty Dozen, mainly to finance his own movies. \u201cMy idea of the future was of us acting together like the Lunts [America\u2019s most famous theatrical couple, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne]. It took me by surprise when he became interested in directing and writing, but once he had started, he didn\u2019t have the interest in acting he had had before; he looked at it simply as a way to make money so we could make our films.\u201d</p> <p>But she believes that his own experience as an actor made him receptive to the feelings of other actors. \u201cIf an actor said, \u2018I\u2019d like another take,\u2019 he\u2019d say \u2018Sure,\u2019 because anything the actors wanted he would do. And I think part of the reason that people think of everything as improvised is that the actor was predominant. That\u2019s not the case on most pictures. There were no marks on the floor and we wore battery microphones so that we could move around. They were at their early stages, they weren\u2019t very convenient and sometimes you lost a bit of quality of sound, but we reckoned it was worth it for the freedom they gave us.</p> <p>\u201cYou never stopped a take, whatever happened. If you dropped something, you would just carry on. Having that freedom added to the improvisatory reputation. And John wrote his scripts not as people should speak but as people do speak - street talk, general conversation - it gave such a natural feeling to the film that people thought they were improvised.\u201d He also took advice from his actors, asking their opinions as the dailies or rushes were shown, crowded events at which even the person cleaning the editing studio would be asked for his view.</p> <p>After the critical success of Shadows, Cassavetes was invited into the studio system and made two films, Too Late Blues (1961), about a jazz musician, and the drama A Child is Waiting (1963), about kids with learning difficulties. Neither were successful and he returned to independent film-making.</p> <p>\u201cHe had written Too Late Blues for Monty - Montgomery Clift - and Paramount said, \u2018Absolutely not, you must be out of your mind,\u2019 so they recast it with Bobby Darin. He did a very lovely job but suddenly things were taken away from you that you thought were yours. John was intrigued with all of the equipment [while working for the studios] but he was not used to the custom they have out here of people praising you and saying, \u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 and then taking the picture away from you. He got in a fight with Stanley Kramer [the legendary producer-director who died last week] because Stanley had taken the film [A Child is Waitin] and re-cut it and not told him. I don\u2019t think John had any idea that anyone had anything to say about a cut except the director. We were that innocent.\u201d</p> <p>The return to the independent world meant the inevitable return to the problems of financing. \u201cIt was impossible to raise money outside the studio. We totally financed all the films ourselves except for A Woman Under the Influence, for which Peter Falk and his wife paid half. After John had done the screenplay for it, everyone said: \u2018Why does anyone want to see a picture about a crazy middle-aged dame?\u2019 But we were luckier than a lot of young directors now because we were both established actors and when we ran out of money, which was all the time, we would stop and each make a movie. It\u2019s harder for young writers and directors now, unless they are very wealthy, because whoever puts up the money always has a lot to say.\u201d</p> <p>Rowlands insists that, despite his outsider nature, Cassavetes was not interested in politics, yet he is often perceived to have reflected the views of the early feminist movement. I cite the lines of Lynn Carlin, the embattled wife in Faces: \u201cI\u2019ve got lots to say - you want to try me.\u201d But as Rowlands responds: \u201cYou hear both sides - many feminists attack him. He had a great interest in women and a great sympathy for them. His opinion was that society made women quite crazy - and not just the men. It was their mothers making them crazy half of the time. He said men got all the blame but their mothers told them which way to act and to pretend things that they didn\u2019t feel and say things they didn\u2019t mean, to inflate a man\u2019s ego . . . I just thought he saw through a lot of games.</p> <p>\u201cHe had an insatiable curiosity and compassion for just regular people, very often working-class people or artists or women. In Faces, there were older women who expressed their desires and frustrations and that was just not seen at the time. It was considered embarrassing for an older woman to have anything to say about anything emotional.\u201d</p> <p>So difficult was the business of distribution that one night Cassavetes went to a late-night newsstand and bought all the out-of-town papers, from St Louis and Toronto and Chicago, to see which cinemas were playing the sort of films they liked; he would then ring them and ask if they would take his movies. Sometimes it even worked.</p> <p>\u201cJohn was totally fearless, almost unnaturally so. I never saw him depressed, I saw him angry, which they say is the other side of depression, but he was very sure and not particularly influenced by anything anybody said. Our pictures made people feel very uncomfortable much of the time. The characters were very emotionally exposed and people weren\u2019t used to it. Everything was not spelled out. The old tradition was that you prepared the audience but with our films you had to just sit there and hold on to your seats. Some people like that and some don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Cassavetes was often called the \u201cEuropean American\u201d director because his work seemed similar to some of the new wave cinema of the period in Europe. His own taste in films and directors incorporated American masters such as John Ford, Orson Welles and Frank Capra. Rowlands remembers that he once said: \u201cMaybe there wasn\u2019t an America, maybe there was just Frank Capra.\u201d He also admired closer contemporaries like Martin Scorsese, who often praises Cassavetes\u2019 work. When Rowlands and Cassavetes first met as students at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, he admired Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica.</p> <p>So which of his own films was he proudest of? \u201cWhen he was ill, we were talking one day and he said: \u2018Well, I made three pictures I would live or die for.\u2019 Now wouldn\u2019t you think that I would say: \u2018Which pictures were those, John?\u2019 But I felt I knew. Now I don\u2019t know and I can\u2019t say for certain because I don\u2019t want to speak for John.\u201d She hopes that A Woman Under the Influence was one and suspects that Faces and his first, Shadows, may have been the others. Their last film together was Love Streams in 1984: \u201cJon Voight was supposed to do it but at the last minute he couldn\u2019t - one of those commitment things - and John said: \u2018Oh, hell, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 I\u2019m so glad that he did, not that I don\u2019t love Jon Voight, but because that was our last picture together.\u201d</p> <p>Does she ever watch the films she made with Cassavetes? \u201c I don\u2019t really have to - when I want to, in my mind, I can roll them from the first frame right to the very end.\u201d</p> <p>The John Cassavetes season runs at the National Film Theatre, London SE1 (020-7928 3232), until March 30.</p>",

A corollary to this is that jazz and classical musicians (with a few notable exceptions) don't really get going until well after this age. So it is interesting to hear this lovingly performed album of eight works for percussion written by Lou Harrison while he was in his early 20s. Much later, Harrison (born in 1917) developed a deep interest in Indonesian music and built and wrote music for gamelans, but these pieces show that his compositional personality was well established long before he began exploring other cultures seriously. </p> <p>As a teenager, Harrison studied with Henry Cowell and Arnold Schoenberg, from whom he learned simplicity - how to strip a piece to its salient points. The Viennese composer apparently also told him: \"Study only Mozart.\" Admittedly, it is hard to detect a Mozartian influence in pieces such as Fugue (1941), with its wild and complex polyrhythms and wailing, siren-like flexatones. In fact, many musicians of the time considered the scores \"unplayable\", and Harrison has never achieved either the notoriety and influence of John Cage or the multi-performance ubiquity of composers such as John Adams and Elliott Carter. His three-part Suite (1942), Canticle (1940), and the Fifth Symfony [sic] (1941) are full of invention and thoroughly enjoyable, though I would recommend listening to this album in segments rather than sitting down to 70 minutes of percussion music in one go. </p> <p>Labyrinth No 3 (1941) employs a larger ensemble, full of gongs, tam-tams and shakers, organised with the same good-natured sense of purpose as his pieces for smaller forces. Harrison can't help writing melodies (he calls his motifs \"melodicles\"), even when he only has unpitched instruments at his disposal. It would be interesting to programme these ambitious early pieces alongside Harry Partch's work from the same era. (Harrison didn't discover Partch and his music until the late 1940s.) </p> <p>The players of the Maelstr\u00f6m Percussion Ensemble, directed by Jan Williams, attack Harrison's scores with just the right balance of delicacy and funky gusto, and the recording is immaculately recorded and mixed with a clear stereo image - which is essential for a sound-world created entirely from percussion. </p> <p>The album's outstanding piece is the six-minute Double Music (1941), a co-composition by Harrison and his friend John Cage. It has many of the sneaky rhythmic and timbral hooks you hear in Cage's later Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano, but its shape, structure and junk-yard orchestration seem more Harrison-like. Moreover it's a young man's piece, out to impress and seduce and make a bit of noise - and there's nothing wrong with that, as Craig David might tell you. </p> <p><strong> Mel Torme</strong> In the Lounge With . . . <br>(Columbia)<br> *** <br> \u00a38.99<br> </p> <p> Though Torme never sang a duff note in his life, his jazz fans might be embarrassed by some of the tracks on In the Lounge With . . . , a canny follow-up to a repackaging job of the same name for Andy Williams. The singer has now been claimed as a loungecore hero, for whom the details of phrasing and musicality are incidental to the pursuit of a pinkly decorated, animal-print world of 1960s camp. Secret Agent Man is John Barry-inspired boogaloo fluff, while Dominique's Discotheque and Ciao Baby are pure soap opera (as Bing or Frank might have said). The hit Coming Home Baby, which became a kind of fusion anthem, balances the fine line between retro cool and the real thing. </p> <p>Some of the kitsch artefacts and music claimed by the lounge gang barely work out of context - their laminated, multicoloured awfulness needs a strong dose of ironic detachment. But whatever you think about the loungification of Torme, he couldn't help being good, even in the cheesiest surroundings. In the company of jazz musicians (all uncredited, of course) he shone: the arranger of Swinging on the Moon slips in a reference to Godchild (from Birth of the Cool), and the repertoire includes tunes by Duke Ellington and Cole Porter, and a groovy reinvention of 42nd Street - not quite in the Alasdair Nicolson league, but witty nevertheless. </p> <p>Whether you sip your Manhattan in a Barcelona chair or a Verner Panton womb with a view, there's a strong argument for craft and skill in your consumer goods.

Robert Carlyle is an ex-Manchester City striker who once scored a hat-trick against United but goes unrecognised as a local school football coach. If you can believe that, you are asked to swallow Ray Winstone as a diehard City fan. Mancunian, my arse, as the great philosopher Jim Royle might say. It's full of sentimental homilies and clunky scripting. I felt most sorry for Lewis McKenzie, very likable as the aspiring kid footballer of the title. E - Eminem Retail (\u00a312.99) Universal Cert 15 *** Now that it's illegal not to have an opinion about Eminem, this collection of seven of his best-known numbers could help push you one way or the other. Oddly, the videos are in reverse chronological order, starting with the impressive Stan and working towards the blatant misogyny of his early stuff. But in today's shockingly bland pop universe, Eminem's music is at least about something and, for anyone who has been to Detroit, his raps fit the post-industrial setting like an iron glove.",

The confusion has arisen because the violence of the crash had caused human remains to be scattered over a considerable area. The wreckage of the GNER passenger train will not be removed from the Selby train crash site until the personal effects of all passengers have been recovered, police coordinating the clearance operation said. A police spokesman said that the painstaking operation to clear the site of Wednesday's tragedy was likely to take the recovery teams many more hours, but could prove vital in identifying the dead. He said: \"After the Ladbroke Grove crash, more than 2,000 different items belonging to the passengers had to be recovered. This gives some idea of the task we are facing here.\" Meanwhile, the company that insures Gary Hart -, the driver whose Land Rover careered off the road and triggered the disaster - has confirmed that claims from crash victims could run into \"tens of millions of pounds,\" Alan Sendall, claims director at Fortis Insurance, said: \"I confirm that this insurance policy provides unlimited liability in respect of third party claims. \"At this stage it is impossible to estimate the total cost of claims, although we expect it to run into tens of millions of pounds.\" Human remains from 13 different locations around the crash site have already been recovered and it is feared more could be found once the heavy lifting equipment is used to drag the wreckage clear of the track. Some of the survivors of the disaster, which killed 13 people and wounded 76, were today still fighting for their lives in hospital. Thirty-three of the people injured were being treated in several hospitals in Yorkshire and Newcastle. Six people were in intensive care, two of them in critical condition. Relatives of those feared dead have been offered the chance to visit the crash scene and some were expected to make the pilgrimage. Superintendent Tony Thompson, of British Transport police, said that the relatives might find it useful to visit the site to help them come to terms with the tragedy. He said that only by viewing the devastation would it be possible for the families to understand why the operation to recover the bodies had taken so long. Overnight, rescue workers continued construction on a road that will allow heavy equipment to be brought in. They also began to assemble a giant crane to lift the carriages of the passenger and freight trains. Confirmed among the dead were the driver of the GNER train John Weddle, a divorced father-of-two from Throckley, near Newcastle, and one of the drivers of the goods train, Stephen Dunn, a 39-year-old father-of-two from Brayton, Selby. A chef on the GNER train, Paul Taylor from the Newcastle area, was also confirmed dead and the company said that a third member of its crew, customer operations leader Raymond Robson, 43, from Whitley Bay, was \"unaccounted for\".

The trains don't run on time, the animals are - ahem - a little off-colour, and the streets are littered with shysters with bad moustaches selling two-quid \"designer\" gear. We are becoming a nation of pub bores, wannabe celebs, wankers who soak passers-by with their BMWs and, most terrible of all, unhealthy people wearing tracksuits. However, you won't find this in pop music, since the last group to gloriously encapsulate the ridiculousness of being British (the Fall) have disappeared from the airwaves, and may well have been run out of the country. </p> <p>This sorry state of affairs has inspired Experimental Pop Band, who have experienced plenty of life at the absurd end of blighty.com. For years, mainman Davey Woodward toiled in the Brilliant Corners. Audiences ignored them in favour of bands who sounded more glamorous and American. Critics ridiculed them as the definitive example of everything loser, shambling and indie (for their fans, five at the last count, these were pluses). In 1995, motivated by musical ambition and revenge, Woodward formed Experimental Pop Band. Then bassist Chris Galvin died of cancer. Those sort of experiences can make or break a band, and here, on their third album (their first songs since Galvin's death), EPB have delivered. Produced by PJ Harvey collaborator John Parrish, The Tracksuit Trilogy is a marvellously sardonic, pithy record, rooted in classic, spiky British pop. </p> <p>Narcotic Daze and the eerie The Bereaved echo Roxy Music and Wire. Hard Enough could have come from the run of classic Stranglers singles of the late 1970s. However, EPB's musical reach goes worldwide, mixing styles from Velvets rock to War funk to jazz. It all hangs together because of their hooklines. Emotion is just one potential single, a stunning electronic soundscape somewhere between Giorgio Moroder-era Sparks and Blur's Girls &amp; Boys (in fact, EPB most often conjure up a more jaundiced, bittersweet Blur). Then again, a song such as Somethingsaremoreimportantthanmusic, a mid-1970s disco being flattened by a Martin Hannett industrial groove machine, is so adventurous it's virtually uncategorisable. </p> <p>With the band revelling in this role as deranged jukebox, Woodward establishes himself as the most potent Brit social commentator since Jarvis Cocker. Emotion finds him staring at the TV, numbed by the bombardment of everything from Madonna to genocide (\"I've got a lot of emotion, but it don't seem that way\"). The brilliant, Kinks-y All Hang Out harangues lad culture, with its \"vomit down the trouser leg\" giving way, with unconcealed delight, to \"maisonettes crumbling down to ragga sounds\". Woodward's Mark E Smith sneer is even more withering when he is pondering Britain's facade of tacky glamour, from the thrill-less modern Bristol in Casual Sex to Hard Enough's \"It's hard to dance in your Kookai nylon pants. Won't show any passion. Things like that are out of fashion.\" </p> <p>However, Woodward never comes across as a moaner, because his acerbic eye for human nature is couched in the blackest of humour (example: \"It's hard enough being a Siamese twin, always doing the say-ay-ame things\"). Some may find this a little too caustic, or lacking warmth, but it's fundamental to his appeal. Like Victor Meldrew or Basil Fawlty, this is a person crushed by the notion of a stiff upper lip, his feelings disguised behind wit, irony and grim resignation and lashing out at everybody when they erupt. A typical 2001 Englishman, in fact, fronting a quintessential, fantastic, modern English band.</p>",

Every forlorn jingle was checked as the team, in yellow tabards and white boiler suits, painstakingly freed the bodies of the 13 known fatalities, including four railway workers, and prepared for a final search once cranes have hoisted an unstable pyramid of coaches out of the way. The dead who were named last night included the driver of the 4.45am Newcastle-London express, John Weddle, and the train's chef, Paul Taylor, both from Tyneside. A third member of the crew, Raymond Robson, 43, a customer operations leader from Whitley Bay, was \"unaccounted for\".

His co-driver Andrew Hill, also 39, is still in hospital but in a satisfactory condition.

Specialists meanwhile started to tackle the effects of 3,000 gallons of spilt diesel from the broken-backed freight engine and tonnes of power station coal tipped out from upended bunker wagons. Fears that there might be more bodies in the wreckage are focused on part of a first class carriage, stamped flat as another coach rolled over it, and on a chaos of broken wheels and undercarriage below another first class carriage and the buffet car. The head of the recovery operation, Chief Inspector Martin Hemingway, said small voids in the twisted metal had not yet been been physically searched, though sound and thermal detectors had swept the train four times. Careful removal of scores of personal possessions and split-open luggage was also underway to help with identification, he said, including tracking down the mobiles. \"Their rings are quite unnerving,\" he said. \"You naturally think they may be from people trying to ring their loved ones to see if they are all right.\" Gary Hart, 36, the driver whose Land Rover careered down the M62 verge and on to the main line, triggering the disaster, was released by British transport police without charge yesterday.

Police confirmed that the possibility of driver error, including dozing at the wheel, was one line of inquiry being considered, but only along with motorway conditions, the state of the Land Rover and the possibility of a tyre blowout. The last is understood to be Mr Hart's belief, but forensic checks on the Land Rover's sheered-off front section will take several days to complete. Mr Hart's wife Elaine, 38, said reports of him falling asleep at the wheel were \"rubbish.\" She was in tears as she told reporters at Withern, Lincolnshire, where the couple live with their four daughters, that Mr Hart was undergoing counselling and was suffering a lot of pain. Crash investigators were examining whether the 30-tonne driving car on the GNER express had sufficient weight to be leading the train and whether the train would have remained on the rails if the 80-tonne locomotive had been leading, instead of being at the back. Villagers in Great Heck laid flowers on the bridge which takes Heck and Pollington Lane directly above the derailed second wagon of the coal train and the last coach of the doomed express. The Bishop of Doncaster, Rt Rev Cyril Ashton, joined a rota of volunteers at the mission chapel of St John the Baptist, after conducting a special service in the nearby market town of Snaith.

      "body": "<p><strong> Various </strong> 25 Years of Rough Trade Shops <br>(Mute) <br> ***** <br> \u00a320.99 <br> </p> <p> If Rough Trade hadn't opened in 1976, Nick Hornby would probably have invented it. It's spent a quarter of a century as London's premier alternative record shop, supplying what Jon Savage, in this celebratory 4-CD set's booklet, calls \"beyond-the-minute recorded information capable of surprising even the most jaded\". CD1 covers punk's immediate aftermath, when the maligned genre \"indie\" encompassed anything that strove to be intelligent and exciting: the brainy pop of the Go Betweens, Cabaret Voltaire's threatening electronica, Joy Division mining introspective depths. It's an endlessly startling opener. At what point did indie stop sounding like this? Who let the boring blokes with \"classic rock\" songbooks take over? Not Rough Trade. The other three CDs cover the past 20 years and cheeringly ignore indie music's drift to the mainstream, becoming more wilfully eclectic. The Smiths and Pixies give way to Cornershop and Clinic; feisty women abound (from shouty Huggy Bear to rapper Peaches); dance music creeps in via Plastikman and the Chemical Brothers. The effect is less historical document than friend's compilation tape: made with love, packed with wonderful music. (AP) </p> <p><strong> Eric Clapton </strong> Reptile<br> (WEA) <br> *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> While he is bogged down in bluesy self-indulgence live, Eric Clapton's recording career is more disciplined. His first solo studio album since 1998's Pilgrim chugs along in unhurried, pleasing fashion. As with many solo artists, Clapton's wares are voice, songs and guitar. Unlike his peers, Clapton's voice and songs are obscured by his baggage. His voice is much underrated, long mistaken for mere window-dressing. The difference between the warmth and anguish of Broken Down and the clinical hollering which lets Come Back Baby down so badly is that voice. The casually offensive I Wanna Little Girl aside, the songs pass muster: Travelin' Light resembles an up-tempo JJ Cale shuffle, before it skips daintily into Leo Kottke territory, and Stevie Wonder's Ain't Gonna Stand for It is pushed in intriguing piano-led new directions. And the guitar? Well, it's there, although too frequently employed as hubristic bluster. Yet the gorgeous instrumental title track almost shows why misguided fools once equated him to god. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Turin Brakes</strong> The Optimist <br>(Source) <br> ** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> It's no surprise that Turin Brakes are being tipped as one of this year's Coldplays: they too plough a conservative furrow already traced by a thousand other male bands. Their debut album is littered with rampaging guitar solos (Save Me, The Door and more), and dire lyrics such as: \"All my colours bleed for you/ can't you see them running/ my hazy hills glow green for you/ you can just call me on my mobile number\" (Emergency 72). Of course, these are early days for singer-guitarists Ollie Knights and Gale Paridjanian, but let's hope that their music in future veers closer to the territory of By TV Light, easily the stand-out track here. The music is far more experimental, a shimmering wash of sloping bass, dusky guitar notes, clinking glass and the weird static sounds of TVs clamouring for attention. And Knights's voice sounds significantly less strained, even beautiful. This, at least, is music to be optimistic about. (MC) </p> <p><strong> Tim Finn </strong> Say It Is So<br> (Hypertension) <br> *** <br> \u00a311.99<br> </p> <p> Were Tim Finn not forever toiling in the shadow of his more gifted, more successful kid brother Neil, he would be regarded as exactly what he is: a fine singer-songwriter with a handsome pedigree. Say It Is So should redress the imbalance a little. These are sturdy, literate songs, brimming with neat little twists such as Finn's echoey vocals, which add eeriness to the already atmospheric Need To Be Right and the Prefab Sprout-esque chorus to Twinkle. He lacks sufficient flashes of genius to elevate him into songwriting Valhalla, but he comes close on the Byrdsy Some Dumb Reason: the sort of rollicking, chorus-heavy anthem baby brother has never quite been able to master. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Elf Power </strong> A Dream in Sound <br>(Shifty Disco) <br> *** <br> \u00a311.99<br> </p> <p> With A Dream In Sound, Elf Power have captured a golden moment in pop - the slow melting of the British Invasion into the sunny psychedelic sounds of 1967. Here are stories that make you smile, capturing the sense of excitement at the advent of something strange and new but holding close to the belief that a short, sweet pop song is perfection. In Jane, about a day-dreaming girl, the bass and lilting keyboards resonate against the winsome lyrics. It's a lovingly crafted mix of cleverness and wonder. Andrew Reigers's vocals, while sometimes sounding too high for his own good, are almost breathless with awe. Old Tyme Waves sounds like the Rutles and We Dream in Sound stomps along good-naturedly, with a noisy drum part that's surprisingly fierce. It's a mad but sweet-smelling breath of fresh air. (BC) </p> <p><strong> Snow Patrol </strong> When It's All Over We Still Have To Clear Up <br>(Jeepster)<br> **** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Snow Patrol take lo-fi charm, add some dirty riffs and buckets of regret and passion, yet still sound innocent. Maybe it's the casual vocals, gliding over the sassy synth and swooning guitars. It could be the trumpet and backward drum loops. Or perhaps it's how personal these songs are. Listening feels intrusive, with On Off - an open letter of remorse - particularly special, accepting responsibility where Coldplay's Trouble blames everyone else. The theme of the death of a relationship reappears throughout the album, the sense of disbelief tangible. \"Even if we shouldn't be here, I cannot help myself with you,\" a tiny voice full of fear sings on Black and Blue, before it turns into a frenzied New Wave guitar epic. The fragile Make Love to Me Forever hints at a desperate clinging onto something that's fading away. Sad, sexy and simply great. (BC) </p> <p><strong> Giant Sand </strong> Selections Circa 1990-2000 <br>(Loose Recordings) <br>**** <br> \u00a311.99<br> </p> <p> There are a lot of people under the delusion that they're playing authentic American desert roots-rock. Most of them wouldn't be fit to lick the dust off JJ Cale's boots, but Howe Gelb's Giant Sand are a magnificent exception. Gelb sounds as authentically sun-baked as a lizard basking on a rock in his native Tucson, and his leathery croak of a voice is impeccably matched with music that drifts out of your speakers like tumbleweeds at sundown. This decade's worth of Giant Sand music, including a few related items such as a Tex-Mex version of Lee Hazelwood's Sand featuring Lisa Germano, amounts to a plausible manifesto for Gelb as a true American classic. Whether he's trekking through a painfully ragged take of Neil Young's Music Arcade or evoking a heat-haze in The Inner Flame, his music makes you want to mop your brow and trot wearily towards the next watering-hole. Giddy-up! (AS) </p> <p><strong> My Vitriol </strong> Finelines <br>(Infectious) <br> *** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> You'll search in vain for anything especially vitriolic about either this debut or its Anglo-Sri Lankan creators. Despite the odd rumble of thug-metal, My Vitriol seem to be as mild-mannered as kohl-eyed mainman Som Wardner's old buddies, Coldplay. Wardner sweetly sings of \"falling at your feet\", and mourns a relationship that is \"just as empty as it seems\", and what vitriol he harbours is expressed only in small, manicured bursts of distorted guitar. Those bursts, though, have seen them adopted as leading lights of the British nu-rock fraternity, a tag that doesn't suit their melodic pop proclivities. Perhaps that's why they titled one 30-second screech of white noise Critic Orientated Rock. Mostly, they tread a catchy path delineated by imploring vocals and shiny choruses that owe something to both Irish guitar-pups Ash and the Manic Street Preachers. They perfect their technique on the wildly infectious Always Your Way and Cemented Shoes, which are as good a place as any to start on this diverting album. (CS) </p> <p><strong> The Clicking Stick </strong> Mocrophone <br>(Rictus Recordings)<br> *** <br> </p> <p> At first, Mocrophone seems to be one of the oddest records ever made. Titles such as I've Got the Blues Because My Hands Are Flowing Red conceal an apparently sprawling mess of trombone grunts, \"head in clay urn chanting\" and a rhythm section that sounds like a broken typewriter. However, get past the shock of such avant-garde leanings and the Birmingham's band's experiments become thoroughly addictive, although not for the faint-hearted. There's a perverse logic here that recalls the pioneering spirit of 23 Skidoo and Captain Beefheart, and even the deranged jazz segments of Bowie's Heroes and Outside albums. However, Martin Longley's impassioned and barmy vocals (\"Dead trousers, airing up the legs\" indeed) - give Mocrophone unique character. Quite where the warped piano magic of Hand Leather Regurgitator (\"blazing masturbator . . . \") will take them is anyone's guess, but at this has all the hallmarks of a minor, peculiar cult.

Despite the odd rumble of thug-metal, My Vitriol seem to be as mild-mannered as kohl-eyed mainman Som Wardner's old buddies, Coldplay. Wardner sweetly sings of \"falling at your feet\", and mourns a relationship that is \"just as empty as it seems\", and what vitriol he harbours is expressed only in small, manicured bursts of distorted guitar. Those bursts, though, have seen them adopted as leading lights of the British nu-rock fraternity, a tag that doesn't suit their melodic pop proclivities. Perhaps that's why they titled one 30-second screech of white noise Critic Orientated Rock. Mostly, they tread a catchy path delineated by imploring vocals and shiny choruses that owe something to both Irish guitar-pups Ash and the Manic Street Preachers. They perfect their technique on the wildly infectious Always Your Way and Cemented Shoes, which are as good a place as any to start on this diverting album. (CS) The Clicking Stick Mocrophone (Rictus Recordings) *** At first, Mocrophone seems to be one of the oddest records ever made. Titles such as I've Got the Blues Because My Hands Are Flowing Red conceal an apparently sprawling mess of trombone grunts, \"head in clay urn chanting\" and a rhythm section that sounds like a broken typewriter. However, get past the shock of such avant-garde leanings and the Birmingham's band's experiments become thoroughly addictive, although not for the faint-hearted. There's a perverse logic here that recalls the pioneering spirit of 23 Skidoo and Captain Beefheart, and even the deranged jazz segments of Bowie's Heroes and Outside albums. However, Martin Longley's impassioned and barmy vocals (\"Dead trousers, airing up the legs\" indeed) - give Mocrophone unique character. Quite where the warped piano magic of Hand Leather Regurgitator (\"blazing masturbator . . . \") will take them is anyone's guess, but at this has all the hallmarks of a minor, peculiar cult.

      "bodyText": "A relaxation of the nationwide ban on the movement of animals, imposed to stop foot and mouth disease from spreading, was announced today to help farmers and boost the country's dwindling meat supplies amid fears of panic-buying. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, said animals in disease-free zones will be licensed to go to slaughter directly to approved abattoirs, possibly by Tuesday of next week. Four more cases of foot and mouth disease were confirmed today in Worcestershire, Wiltshire, Dumfries and Cumbria, taking the total to 37 for the UK. Irish police today also sealed off a farm in County Louth and a meat factory in Kildare amid mounting fears that the disease may have spread to the Republic of Ireland. Officials moved into the premises, around 20 miles south of the border with Northern Ireland, in the early hours. Reports indicated the farm may have received sheep from north of the border which had come into contact with the disease. The operation was centred close to the main Belfast-Dublin road and about 30 miles from the farm at Meigh, south Armagh, where 20 sheep were discovered with the disease. They had been bought in a market in Carlisle before the outbreak was discovered. The Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, today said the disease represented a \"once-in- a-generation\" threat to his country. News of the latest confirmed cases came as the prime minister, Tony Blair, became embroiled in a row with supermarkets after he accused the country's biggest stores of having farmers in an \"arm-lock\" to produce cheap food. Asda, which yesterday announced it had already run out of pork and lamb at one of its stores and warned of shortages elsewhere, accused Mr Blair of looking for a \"scapegoat\" as concerns were raised that falling farming standards might have contributed to the outbreak and spread of foot-and-mouth. Mr Blair also said that the government were working on a compensation package for farmers and looking at measures to protect the long-term future of farming in Britain. He said the licensed slaughter scheme was \"enormously important\" to get some British meat back into stores, which have been increasing their demand for imports. Concerns over the safety of foreign meat imports have also been raised as the Food Standards Agency (FSA) disclosed that consignments of beef from Germany and Holland imported to East Sussex were found to contain remnants of spinal chord. The chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said that a total of 37,000 animals were having to be destroyed and that 67,000 needed to be tracked down and tested. A farmer is to be prosecuted for allegedly breaching special regulations introduced to curb the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak by allegedly moving cattle, trading standards officials said today. Colin Hebson, of Chapel farm, Cotehill, near Carlisle, Cumbria, will appear before the town's magistrates court on Monday accused of breaking the Foot and Mouth Declaratory (Controlled Area) Order 2001. Vets are continuing to try to untangle the web of trades in sheep in the two weeks before the outbreak was confirmed. The number of cases is expected to rise at the rate of six to eight a day for the next week. Meanwhile, the outbreak has prompted scientists to place the world's first cloned sheep, Dolly, in quarantine. Dolly has been isolated from other animals at the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, and the research centre has been closed to visitors until the disease is under control. Professor Ian Wilmut, of the institute, said the precautions were the same as those being taken at other farms, but acknowledged that Dolly was a special case.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Eminem has been offered more than $4m (\u00a32.74m) to join fellow rap artist DMX in the film Lazarus. But Michael Fleming reports in Variety that the controversial rapper, who has turned down other projects including one opposite Denzel Washington, is unlikely to be tempted by the movie. The film will tell the story of two young men who die and are then brought back to life. As one is good and the other evil, they do battle for dominance in the hip hop world. Eminem has, unsurprisingly, been offered the role of the bad guy. \u0095 Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have announced the winner of their search for a new Hollywood star (see earlier story). According to Reuters, Damon and Affleck have given their own version of a film studio \"green light\" to unknown writer-director Pete Jones, who will now have the chance to make his own film, Stolen Summer, with a $1m (\u00a3686,000) budget and the two stars as executive producers.

Customers were also buying more milk, dairy products, fish and pasta, but so far the company had not seen the panic buying that took place during the fuel crisis. A similar picture emerged from Sainsbury's, Asda, Safeway and Waitrose. How well they cope with demand will depend on whether the public keeps its nerve, they said. Supermarket buyers were hoping to cover shortages in British meat with imports from the Republic of Ireland but if foot and mouth is found there, they will bring meat in from further afield, which will be more expensive. The British Meat Federation, which represents slaughterers and whole salers, said British pork would be in short supply from this weekend, home-grown lamb would last until the middle of next week and beef supplies were reasonable. Small independent butchers were finding it harder get hold of supplies, however, and Graham Bidston of the National Federation of Meat Traders, said they were depending on the Ministry of Agriculture allowing some movement of livestock soon. The junior agirculture minister, Lady Hayman, said measures to introduce limited movement under licence of livestock from uninfected areas could start on Monday. What's going on?

      "bodyText": "Danny McNamee, whose conviction as an IRA terrorist was quashed, today won \u00a35,000 High Court damages for injuries suffered as a result of unjustifiable attacks by prison officers in the wake of an unsuccessful breakout. Mr McNamee, 40, whose conviction for playing a part in the July 1982 Hyde Park bombing was quashed in December 1998, needed stitches to two head wounds after the escape bid from Whitemoor prison, Cambridgeshire, in September 1994. Today, Mr Justice Crane, in London, allowed a claim against the Home Office by Mr McNamee and by fellow escapee, armed robber Andrew Russell, for assault and battery or misfeasance of public office. Russell, 38, who is still serving a 20-year term for an armed robbery and for hijacking a helicopter for a jailbreak at Gartree, was awarded \u00a32,500. A similar claim by 37-year-old Liam McCotter, who was also jailed as an IRA terrorist and has completed a sentence imposed in June 1988 or conspiracy to cause explosions, was dismissed. The judge said that Mr McNamee's evidence that he was hit twice on the head with some object was clearly supported by the medical evidence. \"Although Mr McNamee did not see what object struck him, prison officers had drawn staves at the time. \"The conclusion that he was hit twice with a stave is inescapable.\" The judge accepted Mr McNamee's evidence that after he was restrained on the ground by officers and handcuffed, without struggling, other blows were delivered, whether by fists, feet or batons. He ruled that the blows struck, particularly the two with a stave, were not \"justified or reasonable\". The judge accepted Mr McNamee's evidence that there were some blows and one kick on his arrival back at the prison's segregation unit. He described the failure to obtain more urgent medical attention for Mr McNamee's head as \"inexcusable\", although it did not lead to any lasting aggravation of his condition. In Russell's case, the judge said that the medical evidence about the injuries on his face led him to the inescapable conclusion that he was punched and kicked in broadly the way he described while on the ground, handcuffed and effectively restrained. He also accepted Russell's evidence that an officer stamped on his hand. None of the three, who were legally aided to bring the action - which is likely to cost the taxpayer more than \u00a3500,000 - were in court. The judge said that he was conscious that the principal unlawful activity that evening was the unlawful escape of six prisoners serving long sentences for dangerous crimes, in which guns were carried and fired - one shot injuring a prison officer. \"Some people may take the view that, if a group of armed prisoners escape from a prison, they should not be entitled to complain about any violence to them in the course of their recapture. \"Some people may say that the present action should not have been publicly funded. \"However, the duty of the court is clear: to ascertain the facts and to judge the issues that arise. \"Those who break the law do not forfeit its protection.\" Director general of the Prison Service, Martin Narey, said: \"We will consider the judgment of the court very carefully. \"But I welcome the recognition by the judge that the actions taken by the staff in dealing with a highly dangerous incident involving the use of firearms was very courageous and that officers were in fear of their lives. \"Fortunately, only one officer was shot and he recovered after treatment. \"Staff involved in the recapture of the prisoners put their own lives at risk in ensuring the protection of the public.\" Former Whitemoor prison officer John Kettleborough was shot in the ribs as he investigated a hole in the perimeter fence on the night of the escape bid in September 1994. He received \u00a314,000 compensation for his injuries and now works at a prison in the Cayman Islands.",

Father Vsevolod Chaplin, one of the Patriarch's representatives, clarified these remarks adding that it would be unusual to reverse the decision now, particuarly given the clarity of the original case. \"It is possible that Tolstoy was on the path to repentence, but he didn't get there. One should remember that after the excommunication ruling was made, Tolstoy said himself that he was in agreement with this decision and did not consider himself a member of the Orthodox church,\" he said. Seeking to reassure Orthodox believers about the writer's afterlife prospects, he added cheerfully that excommunication was by no means a sentence to hell. \"Excommunication does not represent damnation as many seem to think; it is simply the recognition that the author's views were wholly incompatible with those of the Orthodox church,\" he said.

The original plan agreed between the cellist and the composer was apparently that Britten should write a set of six such suites, following Bach's example, but whether or not Britten really envisaged completing such a scheme, his increasing ill-health in the 1970s meant that he wrote no more after the third, composed in 1971. </p> <p>Yet the model of Bach is ever-present in what he did write. This is true not only in the sequences of short movements that characterise each work - six in the First (1964), five in the Second (1967), and no fewer than nine in the Third (1971) - but in the kinds of musical form that he employed. All three suites contain a fugue, while there is a chaconne in the Second and a Passacaglia to end the Third. </p> <p>In every movement of these pieces, there are nods towards the baroque - to Purcell as much as to Bach. The way in which figuration is used constantly to decorate a single melodic line is a re-conception of baroque practice in Britten's own, strictly 20th-century terms. There's nothing neoclassical about these pieces, no sense of recycling the past, but an absorption of certain received forms and ideas. This creates an idiom that, in its spareness and rhythmic freedom, is of a piece with the language of Britten's church parables, which were being written in the same period - the first of them, Curlew River, was composed in the same year as the first Cello Suite. </p> <p>It's inevitable that Rostropovich's performances and recordings of the suites continue to haunt all other interpretations, though he has never recorded the Third, perhaps because its premiere at Snape Maltings in 1974 was the last occasion on which he saw Britten. Yet neither of the two fine new versions, by the Norwegian cellist Truls Mork and the British-based member of the Arditti Quartet, Rohan de Saram, seems at all overawed by Rostropovich's readings. They both take their own, distinctly different perspectives on these works. </p> <p>Both of the players are totally in command of the technical challenges that Britten sets - the guitar-like strummed chords, the arpeggiated harmonics, the use of the bow's wood - but Mork is undoubtedly the more expansively expressive player. His tone is bigger and richer than de Saram's, and his rubato more ample; he is more inclined towards making rhetorical gestures. His performances, too, are consistently the slower, and he generally gives more latitude to the sections in which the score allows the performer to set his own tempo. </p> <p>There is something about de Saram's accounts, on the other hand, that is fascinatingly compelling. Despite his brisker approach, he never skimps on detail, or on subtleties. Because his sound-world is leaner, his playing sometimes seems more direct, carrying less historical baggage. </p> <p>Hearing de Saram, you really feel you are being provided with fresh insights into all three suites, whereas Mork offers beautifully conceived and delivered performances that never really alight upon anything new. Yet many listeners will prefer his approach, and there's nothing wrong with that either.</p>",

      "byline": "Andrew Clements",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Finzi: In Years Defaced; Prelude; Romance; Violin Concerto </strong> Ainsley/Little/City of London Sinfonia/Hickox<br>(Chandos) <br>**** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> For Gerald Finzi enthusiasts, the main interest of this centenary tribute will be the first recording of the Concerto for small orchestra and violin, a modest three-movement work from 1927 that was his earliest attempt at an extended instrumental score. Its fusion of neoclassicism and English pastoralism is uneasy; there is none of the ecstatic lyricism that informs Finzi's best works. That, though, pervades the six songs that have been brought together as In Years Defaced, for which five composers were commissioned to orchestrate settings by Finzi to mark his 100th birthday. The results are eloquently sung by John Mark Ainsley. The finest are Colin Matthews's version of To a Poet a Thousand Years Hence, and Judith Weir's At a Lunar Eclipse, though all of them sparkle alongside Finzi's own penny-plain scoring for When I Set Out for Lyonnesse. </p> <p><strong> Josquin: Motets </strong> Orlando Consort <br>(Archiv) <br> **** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> Josquin Desprez (c1455-1521) was one of the greatest of renaissance polyphonists, and the Orlando Consort's scrupulous performances of some of his most magnificent achievements, using new and specially prepared editions of the motets, do full justice to his invention and imagination. In works such as the four-voice Ut Phoebi Radiis and the lament for Ockeghem, Nymphes des Boys, the singers generally take a neutral interpretative line, allowing Josquin's own sense of musical architecture to determine the rate at which the music unfolds, without adding any extra articulation of their own. Some might prefer a more interventionist approach, but the intrinsic beauty of the Orlando's singing disarms most criticism. The clarity of the recording, which keeps every voice distinct even in the densest six-part textures, is a huge asset. </p> <p><strong> Barber: Cello Concerto; Medea; Adagio for Strings</strong> Warner/Royal Scottish National Orchestra/ Alsop<br> (Naxos)<br> *** <br> \u00a34.99<br> </p> <p> Volume two of the Naxos survey of Barber's orchestral music includes the inevitable Adagio for Strings, but both the Cello Concerto and the suite from his ballet Medea are much less well known. They are immediately post-war works, both premiered in 1946, when the ripe neo-romanticism that Barber had use so effectively in works such as the Adagio and the Violin Concerto was beginning to acquire a more astringent, neoclassical edge. In the concerto the cello is given some typically rangy, expressive lines, but the orchestral backdrop is less plush, and the seven extracts from the ballet score, composed for Martha Graham's company, develops that line of Barber's musical thinking still further, with a much more dissonant, hard-edged sound world, even if he still cannot resist the occasional juicy melody. Marin Alsop's performances proclaim her belief in the music, while Wendy Warner is a characterful cello soloist. But in the Adagio especially, the playing of the RSNO lacks just a bit of tonal richness. </p> <p><strong> Mozart: Arias from Die Zauberfl\u00f6te; Lucio Silla; Ascanio in Alba; Zaide; Die Entfuhrung; Idomeneo</strong> Dessay/Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment/Langree<br> (Virgin Classics) <br> *** <br> \u00a315.99<br> </p> <p>Natalie Dessay has yet to be seen on stage in Britain, but there is no better coloratura soprano around at the moment. Yet though this Mozart showcase displays her fabulous technique and even, forward tone very effectively, the results are not quite as beguiling as they could be, and ultimately the whole disc seems lacking in real excitement. Dessay is in her element in the Queen of Night's two arias from Zauberfl\u00f6te that bracket the disc, attacking the top Fs without a hint of strain. She is fine, too, in an engaging rarity from the early Ascanio in Alba. But she is less commanding in the great Martern aller Arten from Entfuhrung, even though she is on top of every technical challenge the music throws at her, and she doesn't quite bring the necessary emotional depth to the numbers from the unfinished Zaide. Admirers of great voices, however, will certainly want to hear what she does. </p> <p><strong> Szymanowski: Concert Overture; Symphony No 2; Songs of the Infatuated Muezzin; Slopiewnie </strong> Kilanowicz/London Philharmonic/Botstein<br> (Telarc)<br> *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> The two purely orchestral works here are early Szymanowski, composed in the years before the first world war when he was still assimilating the massive influences of Wagner and Richard Strauss. The song cycles are later - the gorgeously coloured Songs of the Infatuated Muezzin from 1918 open up an orientalist world that mixes in elements of Debussy and Ravel that Szymanowski explored even more ravishingly in his First Violin Concerto, while the 1928 Slopiewnie transfers that exoticism to the folk sources of his native Poland. As a compact survey of Szymanowski's development it is thoughtfully planned, but the performances under Leon Botstein lack a bit of zip, presence and tonal allure. Meanwhile, the songs ideally need a fuller-toned, more characterful soprano than Zolia Kilanowicz.</p>",

That, though, pervades the six songs that have been brought together as In Years Defaced, for which five composers were commissioned to orchestrate settings by Finzi to mark his 100th birthday. The results are eloquently sung by John Mark Ainsley. The finest are Colin Matthews's version of To a Poet a Thousand Years Hence, and Judith Weir's At a Lunar Eclipse, though all of them sparkle alongside Finzi's own penny-plain scoring for When I Set Out for Lyonnesse. Josquin: Motets Orlando Consort (Archiv) **** \u00a313.99 Josquin Desprez (c1455-1521) was one of the greatest of renaissance polyphonists, and the Orlando Consort's scrupulous performances of some of his most magnificent achievements, using new and specially prepared editions of the motets, do full justice to his invention and imagination. In works such as the four-voice Ut Phoebi Radiis and the lament for Ockeghem, Nymphes des Boys, the singers generally take a neutral interpretative line, allowing Josquin's own sense of musical architecture to determine the rate at which the music unfolds, without adding any extra articulation of their own. Some might prefer a more interventionist approach, but the intrinsic beauty of the Orlando's singing disarms most criticism. The clarity of the recording, which keeps every voice distinct even in the densest six-part textures, is a huge asset. Barber: Cello Concerto; Medea; Adagio for Strings Warner/Royal Scottish National Orchestra/ Alsop (Naxos) *** \u00a34.99 Volume two of the Naxos survey of Barber's orchestral music includes the inevitable Adagio for Strings, but both the Cello Concerto and the suite from his ballet Medea are much less well known. They are immediately post-war works, both premiered in 1946, when the ripe neo-romanticism that Barber had use so effectively in works such as the Adagio and the Violin Concerto was beginning to acquire a more astringent, neoclassical edge. In the concerto the cello is given some typically rangy, expressive lines, but the orchestral backdrop is less plush, and the seven extracts from the ballet score, composed for Martha Graham's company, develops that line of Barber's musical thinking still further, with a much more dissonant, hard-edged sound world, even if he still cannot resist the occasional juicy melody. Marin Alsop's performances proclaim her belief in the music, while Wendy Warner is a characterful cello soloist. But in the Adagio especially, the playing of the RSNO lacks just a bit of tonal richness. Mozart: Arias from Die Zauberfl\u00f6te; Lucio Silla; Ascanio in Alba; Zaide; Die Entfuhrung; Idomeneo Dessay/Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment/Langree (Virgin Classics) *** \u00a315.99 Natalie Dessay has yet to be seen on stage in Britain, but there is no better coloratura soprano around at the moment. Yet though this Mozart showcase displays her fabulous technique and even, forward tone very effectively, the results are not quite as beguiling as they could be, and ultimately the whole disc seems lacking in real excitement. Dessay is in her element in the Queen of Night's two arias from Zauberfl\u00f6te that bracket the disc, attacking the top Fs without a hint of strain. She is fine, too, in an engaging rarity from the early Ascanio in Alba. But she is less commanding in the great Martern aller Arten from Entfuhrung, even though she is on top of every technical challenge the music throws at her, and she doesn't quite bring the necessary emotional depth to the numbers from the unfinished Zaide. Admirers of great voices, however, will certainly want to hear what she does. Szymanowski: Concert Overture; Symphony No 2; Songs of the Infatuated Muezzin; Slopiewnie Kilanowicz/London Philharmonic/Botstein (Telarc) *** \u00a314.99 The two purely orchestral works here are early Szymanowski, composed in the years before the first world war when he was still assimilating the massive influences of Wagner and Richard Strauss. The song cycles are later - the gorgeously coloured Songs of the Infatuated Muezzin from 1918 open up an orientalist world that mixes in elements of Debussy and Ravel that Szymanowski explored even more ravishingly in his First Violin Concerto, while the 1928 Slopiewnie transfers that exoticism to the folk sources of his native Poland. As a compact survey of Szymanowski's development it is thoughtfully planned, but the performances under Leon Botstein lack a bit of zip, presence and tonal allure. Meanwhile, the songs ideally need a fuller-toned, more characterful soprano than Zolia Kilanowicz.",

      "bodyText": "Havas Advertising has brushed off the global slump in advertising revenues by posting a 64% rise in profits. The French company, which is the fourth largest advertising agency in the world, said pre-tax profits for last year had risen to \u00a357m. \"The outlook for Havas Advertising for 2001 and beyond looks very positive,\" said Havas chairman Alain de Pouzilhac. The results were boosted by a contribution from Snyder, the US advertising group which Havas bought in September last year. Mr de Pouzilhac's bullish statement comes despite a marked fall in advertising revenue growth for media companies, which has hit their key source of income. However, advertising agencies have been protected from the downturn because they are involved in a broad range of sectors including market research and public relations. On the other hand, broadcasters are trapped in a narrower and more cyclical advertising market, which is more susceptible to the economic downturn affecting the US economy. The near-recession across the Atlantic has filtered through to companies in the UK, sparking a drastic slump in ITV advertising revenues.

Keep up with the latest news by logging on to SocietyGuardian.co.uk Topping our agenda today are: Housing: Boost in public funding to housing schemes Public money allocated to new housing association homes has reached its highest level in seven years, reflecting the increasing focus on keeping rents low.

These figure heavily in the online trailer. </p> <p>The sneak preview should provide Warner with some respite from a spate of bad publicity surrounding the movie. It has left the studio risking looking as much of a representative of the forces of evil as Potter's diabolical nemesis Voldemort himself. </p> <p>Within days of signing a $103m merchandising deal with Coca-Cola, Warner announced a partial cessation of hostilities in its bid to force several young fans operating websites to surrender internet domains which include the name Harry Potter.</p>",

It follows the trainee wizard from his enrolment in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to his discovery of the full extent of his magical powers, via special effects-laden scenes depicting the broomstick-piloting game of Quidditch. Numerous enthusiasts, sounding suspiciously like adults, flocked to the site's discussion forums yesterday to analyse the brief clip in detail. It is hard to draw many conclusions about the quality of the acting - 11-year-old Daniel Radcliffe, playing Harry, does not speak once. However, the scenes drip with evidence of the \u00a380m that has been poured into shooting of the film at the Leavesden studios in Hertfordshire. Directed by Christopher Columbus, whose credits include Mrs Doubtfire and Stepmom, the film stars Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Hart - plus a flock of computer-animated owls. These figure heavily in the online trailer. The sneak preview should provide Warner with some respite from a spate of bad publicity surrounding the movie. It has left the studio risking looking as much of a representative of the forces of evil as Potter's diabolical nemesis Voldemort himself. Within days of signing a $103m merchandising deal with Coca-Cola, Warner announced a partial cessation of hostilities in its bid to force several young fans operating websites to surrender internet domains which include the name Harry Potter.",

      "bodyText": "The Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday have made pay offers to settle copyright disputes with two websites. British IT news site the Register has been promised a cheque for \u00a3250 by way of an apology for the Mail using one of its stories verbatim. And Mil Millington, who runs a website called the Weekly, which is fast gaining cult status, has been offered \u00a31,600 by the Mail on Sunday to settle the copyright spat. The copyright disputes were brought to public attention when the Register ran a story detailing Mr Millington's plight. It was a follow-up to a longer piece about the similarities between a Register story on anti-Plaid Cymru messages and an article that appeared in the Mail a few days later. According to the Register's editor Drew Cullen, the Mail had believed it was getting the piece from a freelance journalist, and claimed it had never heard of the site. \"If you plagiarise you will be found out. Especially if you rip stuff off the web,\" said Mr Cullen. \"The Register may be an obscure publication so far as most print journalists are concerned. \"But we have more than a million readers a month. And they tell us when our stuff is reproduced elsewhere.\" He added that the \u00a3250 would be donated to Shelter when it arrives in the post. Register reporter Kieren McCarthy, who wrote both pieces for the site, questioned the ethics of taking alleged freelance work without checking sources. \"Why is the political editor of a national newspaper putting his byline on an article he has had very little (or nothing) to do with? Isn't that a bit lame?\" he asked. Mr Millington has been out of the country, but he has posted his version of events onto his website.

      "body": "<p>As the 36th outbreak of foot and mouth disease was confirmed in the UK, fears that the crisis has spread to the Republic of Ireland were heightened today as police closed down a farm and a meat factory.</p> <p>However, in the UK, a relaxation of the nationwide ban on the movement of animals, imposed to stop the disease from spreading, is expected to be announced to help farmers and boost the country's dwindling meat supplies amid fears of panic-buying.</p> <p>Today, a major supermarket launched an attack on the prime minister after he accused the country's biggest stores of having farmers in an \"arm-lock\" to produce cheap food.</p> <p>Asda, which yesterday announced it had already run out of pork and lamb at one of its stores and warned of shortages elsewhere, accused Mr Blair of looking for a \"scapegoat\" as concerns were raised that falling farming standards might have contributed to the outbreaks.</p> <p>The prime minister had said at a meeting last night: \"We all want cheaper food in our shops, but on the other hand the supermarkets have pretty much got an arm-lock on you people at the moment.\"</p> <p>In Ireland, officials moved into the premises of a farm in County Louth, around 20 miles south of the border with Northern Ireland, early today and later into the Kildare Chilling company meat factory in Kildare.</p> <p>Authorities are worried that sheep from Northern Ireland - where the disease was confirmed yesterday - may have been processed at the plant earlier this week.</p> <p>The operation was centred close to the main Belfast-Dublin road and about 30 miles from the farm at Meigh, south Armagh, where 20 sheep were discovered with the disease. They had been bought in a market in Carlisle before the outbreak was discovered.</p> <p>The affected sheep were part of a consignment of 291 which had been issued with a certificate for immediate slaughter on their arrival in Northern Ireland. They never arrived at the slaughterhouse and a man from Banbridge, County Down, where the livestock importer lived, was arrested yesterday.</p> <p>Another 250 sheep, thought to be from the same consignment, appear to have been taken to an abattoir in the centre of the republic at County Roscommon.</p> <p>Vets were trying yesterday to establish whether they were part of the Carlisle batch and police were trying to find 21 sheep unaccounted for.</p> <p>The Irish deputy prime minister, Mary Harney, said: \"This has the potential to do enormous damage to this country. This could stop the Celtic Tiger in its tracks. There are 47,500 people employed in this sector.\"</p> <p>In Britain, six more cases of the disease were confirmed yesterday and four more today, taking the total number of outbreaks to 36. Scotland and Northern Ireland both recorded their first cases as animals at two farms in Dumfries and Galloway, and the farm in south Armagh, tested positive.</p> <p>However, despite the growing numbers of outbreaks, a system is expected to be introduced where farmers in unaffected areas are given licenses to take animals directly to abattoirs for slaughter.</p> <p>The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, and chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore are due to give an update on the latest position at midday and confirm some of the details of the plan.</p> <p>Concerns over the safety of foreign meat imports were also raised last night as the Food Standards Agency (FSA) disclosed that consignments of beef from Germany and Holland imported to East Sussex were found to contain remnants of spinal chord.</p> <p>Today, Mr Blair said that the immediate ban on animal movements has meant that the current outbreak is not yet progressing in the same way as the disease did in 1967.</p> <p>The 1967 outbreak \"was a very serious outbreak which went on for many months\", he said during a question and answer session with business leaders in Cardiff, south Wales.</p> <p>Vets are continuing to try to untangle the web of trades in sheep in the two weeks before the outbreak was confirmed.

Asda, which yesterday announced it had already run out of pork and lamb at one of its stores and warned of shortages elsewhere, accused Mr Blair of looking for a \"scapegoat\" as concerns were raised that falling farming standards might have contributed to the outbreaks. The prime minister had said at a meeting last night: \"We all want cheaper food in our shops, but on the other hand the supermarkets have pretty much got an arm-lock on you people at the moment.\" In Ireland, officials moved into the premises of a farm in County Louth, around 20 miles south of the border with Northern Ireland, early today and later into the Kildare Chilling company meat factory in Kildare. Authorities are worried that sheep from Northern Ireland - where the disease was confirmed yesterday - may have been processed at the plant earlier this week. The operation was centred close to the main Belfast-Dublin road and about 30 miles from the farm at Meigh, south Armagh, where 20 sheep were discovered with the disease. They had been bought in a market in Carlisle before the outbreak was discovered. The affected sheep were part of a consignment of 291 which had been issued with a certificate for immediate slaughter on their arrival in Northern Ireland. They never arrived at the slaughterhouse and a man from Banbridge, County Down, where the livestock importer lived, was arrested yesterday. Another 250 sheep, thought to be from the same consignment, appear to have been taken to an abattoir in the centre of the republic at County Roscommon. Vets were trying yesterday to establish whether they were part of the Carlisle batch and police were trying to find 21 sheep unaccounted for. The Irish deputy prime minister, Mary Harney, said: \"This has the potential to do enormous damage to this country. This could stop the Celtic Tiger in its tracks. There are 47,500 people employed in this sector.\" In Britain, six more cases of the disease were confirmed yesterday and four more today, taking the total number of outbreaks to 36. Scotland and Northern Ireland both recorded their first cases as animals at two farms in Dumfries and Galloway, and the farm in south Armagh, tested positive. However, despite the growing numbers of outbreaks, a system is expected to be introduced where farmers in unaffected areas are given licenses to take animals directly to abattoirs for slaughter. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, and chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore are due to give an update on the latest position at midday and confirm some of the details of the plan. Concerns over the safety of foreign meat imports were also raised last night as the Food Standards Agency (FSA) disclosed that consignments of beef from Germany and Holland imported to East Sussex were found to contain remnants of spinal chord. Today, Mr Blair said that the immediate ban on animal movements has meant that the current outbreak is not yet progressing in the same way as the disease did in 1967. The 1967 outbreak \"was a very serious outbreak which went on for many months\", he said during a question and answer session with business leaders in Cardiff, south Wales. Vets are continuing to try to untangle the web of trades in sheep in the two weeks before the outbreak was confirmed. The number of cases is expected to rise at the rate of six to eight a day for the next week.

Last November Thomas Duncan, 33, was sentenced to life for the murder at the high court in Edinburgh.</p> <p>An inquiry by consultant paediatrician Helen Hammond, a leading child protection expert, concluded that although Kennedy's death could not have been predicted, it could have been prevented.</p> <p>Dr Hammond said: \"I do not believe that anyone could have predicted the sudden and violent death which occurred. However, a number of opportunities to identify the extent of the risks to Kennedy and for effective intervention had arisen as the case unfolded.\"</p> <p>Concern was first raised in January last year, when social workers received a referral from local playgroup staff, who noted a marked decline in Kennedy's physical appearance and her mother's very negative attitude towards her bedwetting.

      "bodyText": "Social workers and health professionals failed to recognise the risks that led to the murder of a three-year-old Dumfries girl, an independent inquiry has found. Kennedy McFarlane died from brain and spinal injuries on 17 May last year after a blow from her mother's boyfriend sent her crashing into the leg of a bed. Last November Thomas Duncan, 33, was sentenced to life for the murder at the high court in Edinburgh. An inquiry by consultant paediatrician Helen Hammond, a leading child protection expert, concluded that although Kennedy's death could not have been predicted, it could have been prevented. Dr Hammond said: \"I do not believe that anyone could have predicted the sudden and violent death which occurred. However, a number of opportunities to identify the extent of the risks to Kennedy and for effective intervention had arisen as the case unfolded.\" Concern was first raised in January last year, when social workers received a referral from local playgroup staff, who noted a marked decline in Kennedy's physical appearance and her mother's very negative attitude towards her bedwetting. A family social worker visited the family but no formal assessment was carried out. Early last March, Kennedy was admitted to hospital with serious eye injuries. A referral was passed to the social work team manager but he did not think it was necessarily a child protection case and no formal assessment was begun. Later that month, playgroup staff again voiced their concerns about bruising to Kennedy's face, back pain and her general wellbeing but no formal investigation was initiated. Then in April, Kennedy was again admitted to hospital with bruising, ataxia and drug ingestion. A child protection referral form was started by the paediatric social worker but not typed up until after Kennedy's death. After Kennedy was discharged from hospital on 5 May, there was no further social work or health contact. Social workers had begun to arrange a case conference but Kennedy had already died before this could take place. \"By the time of her discharge, despite the repeated concerns, referrals and admissions, a formal child protection investigation had not been triggered and no-one had put all the pieces of the puzzle together creating a total picture of escalating harm within the context of a family in need,\" said Dr Hammond. \"I have no doubt that if a joint investigation into all the circumstances around this little girl from the end of 1999 to early May had been instituted there would have been enough evidence already available to satisfy a sheriff of the need to protect her in a place of safety whilst a risk assessment was completed.\" Director of social services Keith Makin said the inquiry's recommendations had been taken fully on board. \"No child protection system is 100% protective as they rely at some point on the judgment of members of staff. We have made some mistakes, we want to learn from them and we never want this to happen again. Everybody can be absolutely assured that we are hiding nothing and digging into every corner of activity to make sure that we are safe.\" Mr Makin confirmed that disciplinary action was being brought against staff at management and practitioner level as a result of the inquiry but refused to identify them or say what numbers were involved. One person had been moved to a post where they were not making \"operational decisions\". In a joint statement, Dumfries &amp; Galloway council, the local NHS trust and local child protection committee said all agencies accepted the inquiry's recommendations and fully acknowledged the child protection framework did not operate effectively to protect Kennedy. Janet Birks, chairman of the child protection committee, said: \"The agencies involved have already done a lot of work to put the recommendations in place. It is the role of the child protection committee to monitor that work and we take that responsibility very seriously.\"",

      "body": "<p> At last week's British Book Awards there were two targets for compere Tony Hawks's scabrous wit: Anthea Turner and Waterstone's. Anthea Turner, whose autobiography was the dodo of 2000, had sensibly given the evening a miss, but Waterstone's staff were out in force. </p> <p>\"There have been four changes of management since the start of dinner,\" said Hawks, who at that moment was standing a few feet away from Brian McLaughlin, successor to David Kneale as managing director of the ailing book chain, which has 220 outlets and some 20% of the UK book market. Kneale, who was sacked earlier this month, had become the bete noire of publishers with a series of measures intended to put the squeeze on Waterstone's suppliers: increasing the store's take on each book sold; lengthening credit terms; even trying to make publishers pay for window displays. Those may be the rules of engagement in baked bean retailing, squealed the suppliers, but books are different. </p> <p>Few tears were shed when the abrupt departure of Kneale was announced. That is not strictly true: tears were shed, but they were tears of joy. Hawks said at the book awards that small publishers had asked for the date of Kneale's sacking to be declared a national holiday. That got a huge cheer from the publishers and booksellers massed in the Hilton's ballroom. Waterstone's staffers, meanwhile, slumped a little further in their chairs. </p> <p>What gives this everyday story of corporate intrigue a deeper resonance is the cultural status of Waterstone's: it's the bookshop that made Britain enjoy books again. When the charismatic entrepreneur Tim Waterstone launched the company in 1982 with his first store in Old Brompton Road, London, it was revolutionary - large, well-designed, well-stocked shops run by people who loved books. One former executive explains what defined the Waterstone's ethos: \"Liberality, shared enthusiasm, shared passion, generosity.\" It was a potent combination that left the opposition for dead and led to a rapid expansion of the chain during the 80s. </p> <p>Waterstone's was an unlikely success story of the Thatcherite boom years: yuppies, it seemed, had an abiding interest in the more esoteric corners of modern literature. Waterstone's opened more than 80 stores in eight years, employing managers (often young graduates) who were allowed to promote the books they favoured. The shops opened long hours, offered their own recommendations, prided themselves on generating excitement through author events, and made good books enjoyable and accessible. Waterstone's transformed bookselling, and the voluble, jug-eared founder of the chain was happy to claim the credit. \"The whole Waterstone's thesis was built on me,\" he insisted. \"We ordered heavily, piled them high, and publishers backed us with extended credit. We jettisoned the received wisdom of bookselling, and proved that stockholding bookshops really can work financially.\" </p> <p>It all seemed too good to be true, and it was. The 80s were boom and bust. By the end of the decade, expansion had left the chain deeply in debt and in need of a saviour. WH Smith, which ironically had sacked Waterstone in 1981 and prompted him to go it alone, stepped in: it bought the chain for \u00a349m, \u00a310m of which went to the founder. </p> <p>In retrospect, the problems of static sales, falling profits and low staff morale which have beset Waterstone's in the past two years had their origins in that deal. Waterstone's loyalists saw the move as a betrayal: they were the vanguard of the movement to shake up British bookselling, yet here was their general selling out to fusty old Smith's. Waterstone's was henceforth deprived of its freedom of operation, and its entrepreneurial spirit was gradually eroded. </p> <p>For a time, the shops prospered under Smith's control, but by 1997 the parent company was in trouble and wanted to sell its book arm. Tim Waterstone, who had never lost his proprietarial interest in the business, was outraged and countered with a bid for Smith's, saying: \"I just know I can pull Smith's back within six months. I know I can Waterstone it.\" He had turned himself into a verb, and everyone knew what it meant: huge stock, pleasant shops, good locations, knowledgeable managers, and relaxed book lovers idly thumbing through slim volumes of poetry. The bid failed, but Waterstone was instrumental in constructing a new company, HMV Video, which combined Waterstone's 100-plus stores, 270 HMV record shops and Dillons bookshops, which were hastily rebranded as Waterstone's. </p> <p>Waterstone returned as chairman of the group, apparently happy with a hands-off role and extolling the virtues of the chief executive, Alan Giles. But the relationship quickly turned sour. Waterstone made it clear that he felt the stores were being dumbed down and the brand diluted as the chain cut stocks, reduced store managers' independence and sought to concentrate on bigger-selling titles in the face of competition from new chains such as Borders. By the middle of last year, he had lost patience with Giles and Kneale, and said he wanted to buy the business back. </p> <p>Kneale had been an ineffective defender of his managerial revolution at Waterstone's, and was roughed up by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight when small publishers complained to the office of fair trading about their reduced margins. This was at a time when Waterstone's managers were in open revolt over the sacking of Robert Topping, manager of its Deansgate store in Manchester, for refusing to accept Kneale's instructions to accept centralised buying. </p> <p>Topping became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre : he had been with Waterstone's since 1983 and represented its golden age, when every store had a distinct identity and buying was devolved to each manager. Experienced, articulate and be sotted with books, Topping's philosophy was widely quoted: \"Any bookshop can sell the fourth Harry Potter. It's the bookshop which sells the first Harry Potter that matters.\" He appealed against his dismissal; there were pickets outside the Deansgate store, and the press rounded on his allegedly dictatorial boss. A decade of positive public relations for Waterstone's went out of the window. </p> <p>Topping, who started at the Old Brompton Road store, had witnessed the changes at Waterstone's with growing disquiet. \"There was a gradual dilution of the original energy, vision and belief in books,\" he says, \"a bit-by-bit replacement by a new approach, from allegedly professional management, which has resulted in lower sales and less profitability. It was a gradual process starting with the acquisition by Smith's. That was the beginning of a managerial culture with an emphasis on selecting managers with managerial, rather than bookselling, skills. To make a career with the company, you had to get out of books and move into the office.\" </p> <p>Topping, who now runs the Pan Bookshop in Fulham Road, London, says Tim Waterstone must return to breathe new life into the chain he created. \"Back in 1982, he had the foresight to create what was in effect a 21st-century company - a company based on the idea of empowering the staff. He was way ahead of his time. Waterstone's needs him to restore that original vision.\" </p> <p>Others are less sure: a straw poll at the book awards suggested that the fact he had never quite been able to let go had not helped the chain over the past decade, and one former senior colleague wondered whether, if he returned, he would be able to undertake the bout of store closures that will be necessary. </p> <p>The chain has battened down the hatches in the face of the current storms. Small publishers may have been premature in their celebrations of Kneale's sacking, because McLaughlin is promising to be even tougher than his predecessor, ordering managers to sharpen their \"stock turn\". </p> <p>In other words, books that aren't selling should be returned to publishers, and stores should promote what sells. McLaughlin wants a chain that caters for buyers rather than browsers, but critics say that further undermines the Waterstone's ethos. \"It will damage their reputation and business in the long term,\" poetry publisher Hamish Ironside told the Bookseller magazine. </p> <p>The flagship store near Piccadilly Circus, opened in a blare of publicity 18 months ago, symbolises many of the things that have gone wrong.Despite its size, there is no buzz about the place. It doesn't even seem to be very busy. As at the V&amp;A, the cafe appears more successful than the institution it is meant to support. </p> <p>The immediate question is whether Tim Waterstone can manoeuvre himself back to centre stage. \"I won't give up. I won't let this die,\" he said at the time of his battle with Smith's in 1997. \"If you start something, you must finish it.\" That resolve led to his second coming. A third coming really would be something.</p>",

Waterstone's was henceforth deprived of its freedom of operation, and its entrepreneurial spirit was gradually eroded. For a time, the shops prospered under Smith's control, but by 1997 the parent company was in trouble and wanted to sell its book arm. Tim Waterstone, who had never lost his proprietarial interest in the business, was outraged and countered with a bid for Smith's, saying: \"I just know I can pull Smith's back within six months. I know I can Waterstone it.\" He had turned himself into a verb, and everyone knew what it meant: huge stock, pleasant shops, good locations, knowledgeable managers, and relaxed book lovers idly thumbing through slim volumes of poetry. The bid failed, but Waterstone was instrumental in constructing a new company, HMV Video, which combined Waterstone's 100-plus stores, 270 HMV record shops and Dillons bookshops, which were hastily rebranded as Waterstone's. Waterstone returned as chairman of the group, apparently happy with a hands-off role and extolling the virtues of the chief executive, Alan Giles. But the relationship quickly turned sour. Waterstone made it clear that he felt the stores were being dumbed down and the brand diluted as the chain cut stocks, reduced store managers' independence and sought to concentrate on bigger-selling titles in the face of competition from new chains such as Borders. By the middle of last year, he had lost patience with Giles and Kneale, and said he wanted to buy the business back. Kneale had been an ineffective defender of his managerial revolution at Waterstone's, and was roughed up by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight when small publishers complained to the office of fair trading about their reduced margins. This was at a time when Waterstone's managers were in open revolt over the sacking of Robert Topping, manager of its Deansgate store in Manchester, for refusing to accept Kneale's instructions to accept centralised buying. Topping became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre : he had been with Waterstone's since 1983 and represented its golden age, when every store had a distinct identity and buying was devolved to each manager. Experienced, articulate and be sotted with books, Topping's philosophy was widely quoted: \"Any bookshop can sell the fourth Harry Potter. It's the bookshop which sells the first Harry Potter that matters.\" He appealed against his dismissal; there were pickets outside the Deansgate store, and the press rounded on his allegedly dictatorial boss. A decade of positive public relations for Waterstone's went out of the window. Topping, who started at the Old Brompton Road store, had witnessed the changes at Waterstone's with growing disquiet. \"There was a gradual dilution of the original energy, vision and belief in books,\" he says, \"a bit-by-bit replacement by a new approach, from allegedly professional management, which has resulted in lower sales and less profitability. It was a gradual process starting with the acquisition by Smith's. That was the beginning of a managerial culture with an emphasis on selecting managers with managerial, rather than bookselling, skills. To make a career with the company, you had to get out of books and move into the office.\" Topping, who now runs the Pan Bookshop in Fulham Road, London, says Tim Waterstone must return to breathe new life into the chain he created. \"Back in 1982, he had the foresight to create what was in effect a 21st-century company - a company based on the idea of empowering the staff. He was way ahead of his time. Waterstone's needs him to restore that original vision.\" Others are less sure: a straw poll at the book awards suggested that the fact he had never quite been able to let go had not helped the chain over the past decade, and one former senior colleague wondered whether, if he returned, he would be able to undertake the bout of store closures that will be necessary. The chain has battened down the hatches in the face of the current storms. Small publishers may have been premature in their celebrations of Kneale's sacking, because McLaughlin is promising to be even tougher than his predecessor, ordering managers to sharpen their \"stock turn\". In other words, books that aren't selling should be returned to publishers, and stores should promote what sells. McLaughlin wants a chain that caters for buyers rather than browsers, but critics say that further undermines the Waterstone's ethos. \"It will damage their reputation and business in the long term,\" poetry publisher Hamish Ironside told the Bookseller magazine. The flagship store near Piccadilly Circus, opened in a blare of publicity 18 months ago, symbolises many of the things that have gone wrong.Despite its size, there is no buzz about the place. It doesn't even seem to be very busy. As at the V&amp;A, the cafe appears more successful than the institution it is meant to support. The immediate question is whether Tim Waterstone can manoeuvre himself back to centre stage. \"I won't give up. I won't let this die,\" he said at the time of his battle with Smith's in 1997. \"If you start something, you must finish it.\" That resolve led to his second coming. A third coming really would be something.",

      "body": "<p>Parenting, they say, is the new rock'n'roll, and next week we will be treated to some improbable evidence for the claim. On Tuesday night Michael Jackson will appear before a packed Oxford Union to discuss his newest project: a charity aimed at \"bringing parents closer to their children\". The following evening the entertainer and philanthropist will appear at a star-studded tribute show at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, proceeds from which will go to the charity, Heal the Kids. </p> <p>If the idea of a man once very publicly accused of abusing a teenage boy launching himself as an authority on parenting seems bewildering, the aims of Jackson's new charity remain distinctly hazy. According to a brief statement on his fan club website, \"the aim of Heal the Kids is to encourage adults to reprioritise children, trusting that, by bringing our children from the periphery of our attention to the centre of our daily consciousness, we can imbue them with the love and devotion which they so badly need and break the cycle of neglect.\" </p> <p>The statement elaborates briefly that \"Major studies show that children who experience no tactility, no tenderness or hugging in their formative years, bear emotional scars that will not heal later in life. However, parents nowadays have often been replaced by television, computers, and home video games.\" </p> <p>The charity is not short of heavyweight backing. Among its listed board members are former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres, Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, and Denise Rich, the Democrat socialite at the centre of the Clinton cash-for-pardons row. No one knows precisely how Jackson plans to pursue his lofty goal of re-enthusing the world's parents about their progeny, but we know that he is very serious about it: despite breaking his foot in a fall at his Neverland ranch this week he insisted he would honour his Oxford engagement. \"The message of Heal the Kids is far too important to me to allow a broken foot to keep me from this commitment,\" he declared. </p> <p>Jackson's partner in parental proselytising is Shmuley Boteach, the rabbi best known for writing a bestselling book encouraging Jews to have more sex. He and Jackson decided to launch Heal the Kids after being introduced in September by their mutual friend, Uri Geller. (\"Uri said, 'I think you'll really like Michael Jackson, I got to get the two of you together,' and I said, 'Well, if you're twisting my arm!' Ha ha ha!\") </p> <p>The deliciously improbable troika will be getting together on Wednesday when Geller renews his wedding vows in a traditional Jewish ceremony at which Jackson will be best man. Boteach concedes that the trio may seem unlikely, but says: \"We do have a lot of common characteristics. Michael started work when he was five, Uri was a big celebrity in his early 20s, and me, I was a rabbi at Oxford at the age of 21. Also, we got a lot in common in that we're all misunderstood.\" </p> <p>First, however, there is the small business of promoting Boteach and Geller's latest joint venture, a book with the unsurpassably bargain-basket-friendly title of Confessions of a Rabbi and a Psychic. In the best tradition of the epistolary novel, it consists of a series of letters between Boteach and Geller as they help each other to come to terms with Personal Growth and What it's All About (\"Did you feel your dog's warm breath and cold nose against you that day?\" the Rabbi asks his friend, \"... Perhaps you tapped into a higher reality.\") </p> <p>We meet in his hotel room in Piccadilly, London. He is running a little late as he is having difficulties with his caterers. He is younger and shorter than one would expect, and his American twang booms off the marble walls. Five copies of his and Geller's book rest tidily above the minibar. </p> <p>Rabbi Boteach was very much the golden boy of rabbinical society at Oxford. However, after the publication of Kosher Sex - and its serialisation in Playboy - he was publicly reproached by the president of the United Synagogues and was forced to resign from the synagogue in Willesden where he preached. On top of all this, L'Chaim, a Jewish society at Oxford University of which Boteach was president, was embroiled in controversy when it was reported in the national press that some of the funds from donors had gone towards Boteach's second home in London (\"This is a totally normal process in the United States,\" he insists. \"And why should I have to pay for another home?\") </p> <p>Since then, he has moved back to the US with his wife and seven children and is writing books with Geller and Jackson. Once the great young hope of the Jewish community, he now seems to be banished to his bizarre celebrity sub-sect. Unlike many friends of celebrities, Boteach is absolutely delighted to talk about \"my friend, Michael Jackson\". \"When he's in New York, we see each other or talk on the phone almost every day,\" he says, reclining in his armchair. \"We go to kosher restaurants together, we go shopping for our kids' clothes together, sometimes after hours...\" The Boteach family recently stayed at Jackson's ranch to celebrate Jackson's birthday. They had cake and everyone wore little paper hats. The two men have written a book about how to rediscover your inner child. It will be published in December. </p> <p>\"Michael really is a very traditional guy,\" he barks. \"He lived at home until he was 27 years old because he had the traditional belief that you live at home until you're married, which is cool! I like people with traditional values. His daughter has gorgeous little dresses, his son is dressed like a real little gentleman. It's just beautiful, I tell you.\" And what are their names? \"Prince and Paris,\" he replies hurriedly, taking another puff on a fat cigar. </p> <p>Jackson is not an obvious candidate to become a parenting authority. His two children - born by a dermatology nurse from whom he is now divorced - are cared for by a battalion of more than a dozen nurses. Then there was the small matter of the 13-year-old boy who claimed in 1993 to have been sexually abused by the singer - only for his parents to drop the charges after allegedly receiving a payment of $26m (\u00a318.5m) from Jackson. Boteach, however, is dismissive of suggestions that his new friend's relationships with children have been anything other than wholesome. </p> <p>\"Why would anyone believe those charges?\" He answers his own question before I can try: \"For two reasons: Michael settled. He fought the case for four months, but then his lawyers said, 'Forget it, man, you don't have a chance.' He had no choice. Two, they said anyone who spends that amount of time with kids has to be sick. Well, that's not an indictment of Michael Jackson, that's an indictment of our society!\" </p> <p>British parenting groups and experts have so far been decidely guarded about Jackson and Boteach's new venture. \"You couldn't say that the aims are anything other than laudable,\" says Barry Mason, director of the Institute of Family Therapy, \"but I don't notice any mention of any ethical guidelines, which is absolutely vital for any organisation working with children. If you're working with children and if you're promoting ideas about working with children you must be seen to have clear ethical guidelines. One of the most important things for this kind of organisation is to establish your credibility, and that depends on your record in the past. For any organisation that is setting itself up, it needs to convince people that it is credible.\" </p> <p>Boteach, meanwhile, is confident that the public perception of Jackson will not be an impediment to their new venture. \"And anyway, look at how public perception changes - just look at Bill Clinton!\" The rabbi gives equally short shrift to cynical suggestions that his collaboration with Jackson is only the latest of a long line of publicity-courting stunts. \"No. No. Well, sure, publicity is nice, and at first Michael Jackson was like this big pop star, but now we're just intimate friends. No one knew of our friendship for six months. And anyway,\" he says smiling, taking the cigar out of his mouth. \"I've got plenty of other celebrity friends.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting by Esther Addley.</p> <p><strong>Talk</strong><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7fbda\">What do you think?</a> </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4140624,00.html\">22.02.2001: Jacko bans TV from Oxford Union address </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3899344,00.html\">Pass notes: Shmuley Boteach</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3898698,00.html\">05.09.2001: Sex guru rabbi gets passed over</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.mjifc.com/charities/heal_the_kids.html\">Michael Jackson's Heal the kids page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.oxford-union.org/jackson/\">Oxford Union</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jewishtelegraph.com/boteach.html\">Shmuley Boteach's Jewish Telegraph column</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch's on-off takeover of US satellite broadcaster DirecTV appears to be in deep trouble. The \u00a349bn deal is on the verge of collapse because DirecTV owner General Motors wants more cash from Mr Murdoch's News Corporation empire, according to the online edition of the Wall Street Journal. Although the takeover has been trumpeted as a done deal, people close to the negotiations said Mr Murdoch needs to come up with a more lucrative offer for DirecTV and its holding company Hughes Electronics, owned by US giant General Motors. The deal is being seen as Mr Murdoch's last big flourish - but earlier this week he joked he didn't want to spend too much of the time he has remaining on earth in \"useless meetings\" or in \"negotiations with General Motors\". Mr Murdoch, who revolutionised TV viewing in the UK with the launch of Sky 12 years ago, has made it a personal mission to launch similar services in all the most lucrative markets around the world. He already has a foothold in China with StarTV and DirectTV - the biggest direct-to-home satellite service in the US - would have cemented access to millions of US homes. At a New York conference this week Mr Murdoch tried to play down the significance of the deal. Asked if DirecTV was the final piece of his global satellite vision, he said: \"Hell no. There are 6 billion people in the world. There are 250 million here. Don't let's get too excited about it.\" But the deal has been fraught with problems. News Corp insiders have repeatedly scoffed at General Motors' claims that it is holding negotiations with other parties, and analysts say Mr Murdoch may try to find a cash-rich partner to sweeten the deal. \"The DirecTV takeover is too complicated. Perhaps GM wants more cash and less shares, so you could imagine News Corporation finding another partner who can offer cash, such as Vivendi Universal or even AOL Time Warner,\" said Marc Loneux, analyst at Commerzbank. The \"reverse\" takeover involves Mr Murdoch merging his Sky Global Networks satellite TV companies into Hughes. Hughes shareholders would then exit the company over time, leaving News Corp as the major shareholder. If the link-up falters, News Corp could turn its attention to DirecTV rival EchoStar, which has 5m satellite subscribers compared with DirecTV's 9m. \"News Corporation has already tried twice for EchoStar, and the subscriber numbers show it would not be as good as the DirecTV deal. But it still fits in with News Corporation's US Strategy,\" added Mr Loneux. Mr Murdoch needs a US satellite broadcaster to ensure his Sky Global Networks company can live up to its name. Without a US operation, Sky Global would be nothing more than BSkyB in the UK, Star TV in Asia and a few interests scattered across Europe and South America. Analysts and chief executives at rival media groups have registered their approval of the DirecTV merger, but plans to float Sky Global without a US presence have met with outright scepticism. \"If the DirecTV deal collapses and Murdoch cannot get EchoStar, then it is clear that Sky Global is too small,\" said one analyst.

The interest in this special extended EastEnders from 7.40-8.20pm helped BBC1 record its best Thursday peaktime for a year. But after all the hype, which included promotions across peaktime on BBC1 and countless press interviews and photospreads, the episode won't be going down in soap history. Tuesday night's episode got more viewers with an audience of 15.6m and it was nothing compared with \"Sharongate\" in 1995 - when Grant Mitchell, played by Ross Kemp, discovered his wife had been having an affair with his brother Phil. That was watched by a colossal 25.3m viewers. And it lagged millions behind the soap's other big cliffhangers such as Michelle Fowler telling family she is pregnant which was watched by 24.9m. Nevertheless it was a big night for BBC1. A Weakest Link special featuring EastEnders stars turned in the quiz show's best ever ratings. Anne Robinson's fearsome inquisition of actors including Todd Carty, Wendy Richard and eventual celebrity Weakest Link winner Adam Woodyatt pulled in 10.7m viewers and a 44% audience share.

The little-watched ITV2 digital service has bought 110 episodes of the Universal show, which will go out from Monday at 11.50pm after the David Letterman Show. Northern Exposure, which went out on Channel 4 in the UK during the early 1990s, starred Rob Morrow as a New York doctor sent to be the GP of a remote Alaskan town peopled by a cast of eccentrics. ITV2 has also bought 85 episodes of 1970s sci-fi series the Incredible Hulk from Universal for transmission in the spring in a new action adventure slot. From late March, ITV2 will get a chance to watch award-winning US animation Dr Katz on Saturdays. The channel has acquired 81 instalments of the cartoon from US cable broadcaster Comedy Central. In addition, ITV2 has recently bought a package of 14 movies from Columbia Tristar, including Sleepless in Seattle, Philadelphia, Last Action Hero and In the Line of Fire, to run in its 9pm Saturday night film slot from mid March. The broadcaster has also acquired four Columbia Tristar TV shows, including 55 episodes of Tea Leoni sitcom the Naked Truth. Related story Dec 20: New focus planned for ITV2",

Writer John Sullivan has already written three hour-long specials, which will go out as the centrepiece of this year's Christmas schedules.

Mr Sullivan, who wrote all 61 original episodes, said the original stars, including David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst, were eager to appear in the new shows. Buster Merryfield, who played Uncle Albert, died in 1999. The award-winning scriptwriter has been talking of reviving the hit sitcom for years but he has been busy on other projects. In 1999 the prospect of another series was in jeopardy after Mr Sullivan clashed with the BBC over a \u00a34m adaptation of Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield. The row was so bad he walked out of the BBC, ending a 25-year relationship. But Mr Sullivan's gripe was with drama chiefs who didn't like his script for Copperfield - it had been commissioned by the entertainment department who had asked him to write a humourous script with a modern slant. Today Mr Sullivan told the Sun newspaper: \"We're on. All the studio dates have been pencilled in. The stars are up for it and I have the bones of the story in place.\" Only Fools and Horses has been one of the crown jewels of the BBC's comedy schedules.

Mr Cavanagh has teamed up with UK artist Simon Patterson to provide the voice for a screensaver that will appear on the gallery group's website. From May, vistors to the website or galleries will be able to buy a CD-rom of the 12-minute screensaver called Colour Match. Colour Match features Mr Cavanagh reading the Scottish football results as hundreds of Pantone colours flow across the screen. The CD has been designed to look like a red card and comes packaged within a foam football held inside a net bag. This week, the Tate launched a range of paints with DIY retailer B&amp;Q.",

Street prostitutes in Glasgow were six times more likely to have been attacked than those working indoors in Edinburgh. Indoor workers were not immune to violence, however.

A total of 15% of indoor workers had been held against their will, 17% subject to attempted rape and 10% robbed. </p> <p>The author, Marina Barnard of Glasgow University's centre for drug misuse research, said the findings were alarming and suggested that nothing short of legislation and a major shift in public attitudes would make prostitution safer. </p> <p>\"This study is the first look in this country at the levels of violence that women are confronting,\" she said. \"If you are going to address it you need to look at ways of making sex work safer and ultimately there seems to be no way around legal change. </p> <p>\"We need to look at ways of minimising the risk of attack that are not just about pushing prostitution indoors. We need to encourage the perception that client violence against prostitutes is wrong and clients who perpetrate this violence will be brought to book.\" </p> <p>The problem is particularly acute in Glasgow where six prostitutes have been murdered and a seventh has died violently since 1991. There are around 1,000 women working the streets and roughly 90% are on drugs, mostly heroin. The city recently adopted a radical scheme to take women off the streets and stop others entering the profession. </p> <p>\"We see prostitution as survival, not sexual behaviour,\" said Liz Curran of the Routes Out partnership. \"At a social and political level, prostitution, like slavery and apartheid, is unacceptable. We had an option to try and manage it better but we wanted to dismantle it as something that is damaging to women.\" </p> <p>Since October, 30 women have been persuaded to enter the programme, but street workers say more are starting every week. </p> <p>In Edinburgh, city officials operate a policy of liaison and \"discretionary prosecution\", which prostitutes say offers better protection. There are 23 licensed saunas and 90% of prostitutes work in them. </p> <p>\"What we have done in Edinburgh is not rocket science,\" said Tom Wood, deputy chief constable of Lothian and Borders police. \"We have recognised that the sex industry will always be there and that it is dangerous and we have worked along with the local authority and the health authority to reduce the risk as far as we can.\" </p> <p>Ruth Morgan-Thomas, a leading campaigner for prostitutes, said the study was highly significant. \"I think this shows up some very serious issues that society should look at about the sex industry and how it operates. </p> <p>\"The Scottish parliament and the UK parliament need to start examining the reality. Too often we pretend it does not exist because people are uncomfortable about looking at this. We need to look at it in all its complexities. </p> <p>\"We need a cultural shift because our attitude at the moment continues to disempower those working as prostitutes and make them extremely vulnerable.\" </p> <p><strong>The night Moira got it wrong and was almost killed</strong></p> <p>Moira has been working the streets of Glasgow for four years to feed her drug habit.

Chris Oakley, RIM chief executive, said: \"We aim to move toward flotation - possibly in autumn next year - depending upon market conditions, our performance and ability to grow by acquisition. It would be useful if we were a little bigger than we are now.\" Mr Oakley said the company would pursue targets in regional newspapers, albeit that there are few independent groups left of any significant size. RIM will also be looking for acquisitions in business magazines and for further expansion in radio. RIM has \u00a310m in cash, plus borrowing in place amounting to a further \u00a325m. \"Candover has made it clear that more cash would be made available for acquisitions,\" he said. RIM yesterday reported a 22% rise in operating profit to \u00a340.9m and an 8% increase in revenues to \u00a3169m for 2000. The Gannett consortium, which included Johnston Press and the Guardian Media Group, is understood to have lodged an indicative offer of between \u00a3450m and \u00a3550m for RIM just before to Christmas. The approach, which would have led to the break-up of RIM, was the second the consortium had made. \"We are a venture capital-backed company, and venture capital firms are obliged to go into a deal thinking about an exit which means they can never rule out a trade sale,\" Mr Oakley said. \"But there is a real difference between that and a company seeking a trade sale. And we are not seeking a trade sale.\"",

Sheep, goats, pigs and deer imported from the UK in the past month have already gone under the knife in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, and large cattle markets across the continent have suspended trade for the time being. Europe's farmers are understandably starting to ask who will foot the bill for the huge loss of earnings they will undoubtedly suffer, but an expected wave of anti-British feeling has, perhaps surprisingly, not yet materialised. Militant farmers are more than ready to heap opprobrium on \"perfidious Albion\" but most European countries have so far failed to take advantage of what many might regard as a golden opportunity to make a pariah out of the UK. The recent spread of the disease to Northern Ireland has, however, heightened fears that foot and mouth will rear its devastating head in Europe. What if what is being billed as a doomsday scenario does come to pass? It is unlikely European politicians and the media would be able to hold back any longer. That is not to say the outbreak of foot and mouth in the UK has not reinforced an already deep-rooted sense of distrust of all British food products. It has - but Europe's consumers have not visibly taken any satisfaction in being proven right. In the UK, foot and mouth may have topped news bulletins for days, but in Europe the country's woes are reported like any other foreign news story. Europe is still obsessed with the other British outbreak - mad cow disease. Its spread across the continent has already provoked a genuine crisis in European agriculture and the thought that foot and mouth might follow on its heels is, for many, too much to bear. BSE has already strained the European Union's \u00a325m-a-year agricultural budget to bursting point, thanks to compensation payouts for the destruction of millions of older cattle across Europe that cannot be proven to be BSE-free. And EU farm supremo Franz Fischler has warned his pockets are empty. Not a day seems to go by without farmers from somewhere in Europe coming onto the streets to demand greater compensation for BSE and giving vivid expression to their angst that nobody wants to eat their animals anymore. Pre-foot and mouth, European agriculture has already been plunged into crisis and the EU's infamous common agricultural policy is visibly creaking under the strain. This week thousands of disgruntled farmers fought pitched battles with riot police in the centre of Brussels as EU farm ministers deliberated behind closed doors over how to tackle BSE in Europe. Britain's agriculture minister, Nick Brown, flew in to update his colleagues on the foot and mouth situation in the UK, but that was not the focus of the meeting. It was mad cow disease, old news in the UK but hot news in Europe. Europe teeters on the brink as far as foot and mouth disease is concerned. If it does spread to the continent, disaster will ensue and it could deliver the coup de grace to the common agricultural policy and European farming as a whole.

      "body": "<p>The Cheltenham Festival was dealt a potentially fatal blow last night when it was announced that a suspected case of foot and mouth disease was being investigated at a farm five miles from the racecourse.</p> <p>The news followed days of speculation about the fate of the three-day meeting, which the organisers insist will go ahead if possible. They face an anxious wait over the weekend to see whether the farm, at Woolstone, is infected.</p> <p>Tests began at the sheep farm 48 hours ago. Last night the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff) confirmed that Woolstone had not been linked to any previous outbreaks, and Cheltenham's clerk of the course Simon Claisse said there was \"only a 5% chance\" it would prove positive. But time is pressing and investigations could take days.</p> <p>A final decision about the Festival, which is due to start on March 13, will rest with Maff and the Jockey Club, which intends to press ahead with an announcement today on a code of practice intended to allow a resumption of racing nationally next Wednesday.</p> <p>Even if the showpiece event survives it will not do so unscathed, after yesterday's decision by the Irish trainers not to send their runners to the meeting. This ruled out any chance of Istabraq attempting to win the Champion Hurdle for a record fourth time.</p> <p>\"We made soundings with our members before the committee convened and not one of them said they disagreed with our stance,\" said Willie Mullins, the chairman of the Irish Race Horse Trainers Association. \"When you see people losing their livelihoods in a day, nobody in our association wanted to take the chance of that happening over here.\"</p> <p>Edward Gillespie, Cheltenham's managing director, was \"very disappointed\" at the decision taken by Irish trainers, who also urged the public not to travel to the meeting.</p> <p>Cheltenham had received a boost hours earlier when French authorities gave the green light for their horses to travel to Britain. They include the strong Gold Cup fancy First Gold, owned like Istabraq by the big-time Irish punter JP McManus.</p> <p>Professionals in the sport are divided about the Jockey Club's attempt to bring racing back next week. \"I honestly cannot believe it, just don't understand it,\" said Ferdy Murphy, who trains 100 horses at Middleham in north Yorkshire. \"All we are doing is alienating a lot of people who already think we are nincompoops.\"</p> <p>But his fellow Middleham trainer Mark Johnston, who is also a vet, is in favour of a quick resumption. \"The Ministry of Agriculture does not see racing as a threat and the seven-day stoppage has been a reaction to public pressure.</p> <p>\"There has been a fair amount of scaremongering.

      "bodyText": "The Cheltenham Festival was dealt a potentially fatal blow last night when it was announced that a suspected case of foot and mouth disease was being investigated at a farm five miles from the racecourse. The news followed days of speculation about the fate of the three-day meeting, which the organisers insist will go ahead if possible. They face an anxious wait over the weekend to see whether the farm, at Woolstone, is infected. Tests began at the sheep farm 48 hours ago. Last night the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff) confirmed that Woolstone had not been linked to any previous outbreaks, and Cheltenham's clerk of the course Simon Claisse said there was \"only a 5% chance\" it would prove positive. But time is pressing and investigations could take days. A final decision about the Festival, which is due to start on March 13, will rest with Maff and the Jockey Club, which intends to press ahead with an announcement today on a code of practice intended to allow a resumption of racing nationally next Wednesday. Even if the showpiece event survives it will not do so unscathed, after yesterday's decision by the Irish trainers not to send their runners to the meeting. This ruled out any chance of Istabraq attempting to win the Champion Hurdle for a record fourth time. \"We made soundings with our members before the committee convened and not one of them said they disagreed with our stance,\" said Willie Mullins, the chairman of the Irish Race Horse Trainers Association. \"When you see people losing their livelihoods in a day, nobody in our association wanted to take the chance of that happening over here.\" Edward Gillespie, Cheltenham's managing director, was \"very disappointed\" at the decision taken by Irish trainers, who also urged the public not to travel to the meeting. Cheltenham had received a boost hours earlier when French authorities gave the green light for their horses to travel to Britain. They include the strong Gold Cup fancy First Gold, owned like Istabraq by the big-time Irish punter JP McManus. Professionals in the sport are divided about the Jockey Club's attempt to bring racing back next week. \"I honestly cannot believe it, just don't understand it,\" said Ferdy Murphy, who trains 100 horses at Middleham in north Yorkshire. \"All we are doing is alienating a lot of people who already think we are nincompoops.\" But his fellow Middleham trainer Mark Johnston, who is also a vet, is in favour of a quick resumption. \"The Ministry of Agriculture does not see racing as a threat and the seven-day stoppage has been a reaction to public pressure. \"There has been a fair amount of scaremongering. The perception seems to be that horses hang on to the infection and then pass it on. In fact they are no more likely to carry it than a hare.\" Racing is not the only sport in a quandary over how to proceed. Rugby's Six Nations committee will today come under pressure to ensure that the championship is played to a conclusion this season despite the foot and mouth outbreak. The international between Wales and Ireland, which should have been played tomorrow, is likely to be rearranged for April 29, but Irish and English rugby officials are conceding that the meeting between their countries in Dublin on March 24 is almost certain to be called off. Allan Hosie, the chairman of the Six Nations committee, said last night that he was confident France would play Wales at the Stade de France two weeks tomorrow as scheduled. \"As things stand, only one match has been postponed and it will be rearranged,\" said Hosie. \"We hope that the rest of the programme will be played according to schedule, but we would be negligent if we did not discuss a course of action should worst come to worst.\" However, the Welsh Assembly's agriculture minister Carwyn Jones yesterday called for sports fields and golf courses that are adjacent to fields where animals graze to be closed until further notice.

      "body": "<p>The weather this week has been some of the worst I have experienced in three years as an AA man. The conditions have definitely made my work much more difficult. In the mornings I start from home and usually have to dig my own and my partner's car out before I can go anywhere. I usually get a call in the first few minutes. The vehicles that we drive are equipped with a satellite global positioning system which means that as soon as a call comes in, the system plots the closest AA man. The area I cover is large and the countryside can be quite desolate, so it is important that we get to members as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Everything slows down when there's snow on the roads - especially on the smaller ones, which have trouble with heavy drifts coming off the fields and hills. On top of cars breaking down more often, people are more likely to call you out for things they could normally sort out themselves. Normally members wouldn't call you out for something like a flat tyre, but when there's weather like this about, people tend to panic. This means that people have to wait longer for support than they normally do.</p> <p>Generally, though, drivers are quite well prepared because the weather tends to get pretty bad at this time of year in Scotland. People often take extra clothing and hot drinks when they go out.</p> <p>Others have been caught on the hop. On Tuesday night there were 35 people stranded at Whiterashes on the A947, which is one of the main roads out of Aberdeen. They were frightened and very cold. They needed all the help that they could get. It is at times like this that you feel your job is an important one, as there are very few other people who can get out to situations like that.</p> <p>On Wednesday I also had to go and help a young woman who had been stranded with her two small children in a small village for three days. She was starting to run out of food and so decided to try to drive to her local shops. Unfortunately her car wouldn't start and it took me a while to get it fixed. I ended up defrosting her drive, too.</p> <p>At the moment I am doing 10-hour shifts, which means I do get very tired, especially as I am spending a lot of my time in the freezing cold. We are all looking forward to the summer now, which is when our jobs become a lot easier. It'll be nice to put away my shovel.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The weather this week has been some of the worst I have experienced in three years as an AA man. The conditions have definitely made my work much more difficult. In the mornings I start from home and usually have to dig my own and my partner's car out before I can go anywhere. I usually get a call in the first few minutes. The vehicles that we drive are equipped with a satellite global positioning system which means that as soon as a call comes in, the system plots the closest AA man. The area I cover is large and the countryside can be quite desolate, so it is important that we get to members as quickly as possible. Everything slows down when there's snow on the roads - especially on the smaller ones, which have trouble with heavy drifts coming off the fields and hills. On top of cars breaking down more often, people are more likely to call you out for things they could normally sort out themselves. Normally members wouldn't call you out for something like a flat tyre, but when there's weather like this about, people tend to panic. This means that people have to wait longer for support than they normally do. Generally, though, drivers are quite well prepared because the weather tends to get pretty bad at this time of year in Scotland. People often take extra clothing and hot drinks when they go out. Others have been caught on the hop. On Tuesday night there were 35 people stranded at Whiterashes on the A947, which is one of the main roads out of Aberdeen. They were frightened and very cold. They needed all the help that they could get. It is at times like this that you feel your job is an important one, as there are very few other people who can get out to situations like that. On Wednesday I also had to go and help a young woman who had been stranded with her two small children in a small village for three days. She was starting to run out of food and so decided to try to drive to her local shops. Unfortunately her car wouldn't start and it took me a while to get it fixed. I ended up defrosting her drive, too. At the moment I am doing 10-hour shifts, which means I do get very tired, especially as I am spending a lot of my time in the freezing cold. We are all looking forward to the summer now, which is when our jobs become a lot easier. It'll be nice to put away my shovel.",

Dead - An End to Conveyor Belt Funerals, at the Roundhouse in north London, is as much a challenge to the \u00a31bn funeral industry - which the artists accuse of ripping off the public and robbing them of the choice to celebrate a life well lived - as it is an attempt to update grave goods and bring them out of the grip of maudlin Victoriana. The show, organised by the radical art activists Welfare State International, ranges in content from Hussein Chalayan's lavish funeral boat and Owen Gaster's crocheted diamante shroud to Bob and Roberta Smith's budget DIY coffins made from fruit boxes. Linder Sterling, the artist notorious for her Menstrual Eggtimer, spent days roaming Manchester's gothic graveyards with the death-obsessed pop star Morrisey before composing her new non-denominational requiem.

The company had previously said it would be involved in the planning application process before selling the site, which includes Wembley arena and conference centre. </p> <p>Mr Elliott said that while the corporate name had served the company well, an alternative would better reflect the company's present interests. About 90% of Wembley PLC's profits come from the US, while more than 95% comes from its greyhound race tracks and around 13,000 trackside slot machines. </p> <p>Mr Elliott said: \"Wembley has been home for us for 70-odd years, and there is a strong historical link. But we do not judge shareholder value on history.\" </p> <p>Analysts said a sale of the company's remaining Wembley interests was unlikely while uncertainty over the redevelopment of the stadium dragged on. Property developers interested in the site are likely to want to see Brent council's development plan for the area before committing to the sale. The plan is due to be published in November. </p> <p>The site is valued at \u00a350m in Wembley's accounts, but could fetch double that amount if the prospects for redevelopment remain favourable. Possible buyers include Lend Lease, the Australian firm behind Bluewater Park shopping centre, and British Land. </p> <p>Peter Joseph, an analyst at broker Peel Hunt, said: \"The only reason for getting rid of the brand name is if the company can get more from it by selling it.\" </p> <p>The company yesterday posted pre-tax profits for 2000 of \u00a332m - a 20% increase on the previous year - on a turnover of \u00a3115m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wembley, the entertainment and events company, is to change its name following the sale of its remaining interests in the eponymous north London development. Finance director Mark Elliott said that the profile of the company - which sold Wembley stadium two years ago - had been hit by negative publicity surrounding the troubled development of a new national stadium. \"When we read headlines in the Sun like 'Wembley shambles', it really hurt us,\" he said. The company hopes to ac celerate its withdrawal from the London suburb by selling the 50-acre site surrounding English football's leading stadium without securing approval for redevelopment. The company had previously said it would be involved in the planning application process before selling the site, which includes Wembley arena and conference centre. Mr Elliott said that while the corporate name had served the company well, an alternative would better reflect the company's present interests. About 90% of Wembley PLC's profits come from the US, while more than 95% comes from its greyhound race tracks and around 13,000 trackside slot machines. Mr Elliott said: \"Wembley has been home for us for 70-odd years, and there is a strong historical link. But we do not judge shareholder value on history.\" Analysts said a sale of the company's remaining Wembley interests was unlikely while uncertainty over the redevelopment of the stadium dragged on. Property developers interested in the site are likely to want to see Brent council's development plan for the area before committing to the sale. The plan is due to be published in November. The site is valued at \u00a350m in Wembley's accounts, but could fetch double that amount if the prospects for redevelopment remain favourable. Possible buyers include Lend Lease, the Australian firm behind Bluewater Park shopping centre, and British Land. Peter Joseph, an analyst at broker Peel Hunt, said: \"The only reason for getting rid of the brand name is if the company can get more from it by selling it.\" The company yesterday posted pre-tax profits for 2000 of \u00a332m - a 20% increase on the previous year - on a turnover of \u00a3115m.",

Industrial action could include working to rule, a ban on overtime or refusing to treat patients in places nurses consider unsuitable.</p> <p>The full RCN council is expected to support the proposal within the next 10 days. If the hospital does not move quickly to solve the problem, it could be the first to be targeted since the RCN changed its rules in 1995 to permit limited industrial action that did not affect patient care.</p> <p>Patricia Marquis, the union's regional officer, said: \"For several years, conditions have become more and more difficult [at John Radcliffe]. There have been increasing numbers of patients and, partly because of the nurse shortages, fewer beds.\"</p> <p>It was common for every corridor to be full of people waiting on trolleys, but the overcrowding reached crisis proportions 10 days ago when the unit held three times the approved maximum number of patients. \"This means the nurses cannot give patients the best care, or even privacy and dignity, and safety is being compromised.\"</p> <p>Last year the nurses made a formal complaint to the trust management and a panel upheld their complaints, Ms Marquis said. But an action plan was not fully implemented and problems continued. \"The nurses are at the end of their tether and now feel this ballot is their only course,\" Ms Marquis said.</p> <p>David Highton, the hospital's chief executive, said: \"I understand the frustrations of our accident and emergency staff and am deeply concerned about the difficulties they face.</p> <p>\"It is no great secret that the emergency care system in Oxfordshire has been very stretched recently.</p> <p>\"I will continue to talk to the RCN and to our own staff about how we can work together to relieve some of the pressures and improve the system as a whole.\"</p> <p>The hospital serves more than 600,000 people in the Oxford area. A report last year on its heart unit criticised a \"culture of cronyism\" that left the centre in chaos. Personality clashes between doctors left the unit \"on its knees\" and threatened its future, the report said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Royal College of Nursing was last night heading for its first industrial action after staff at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford said overcrowding of the accident and emergency department was putting patients' lives at risk. A union committee agreed to recommend a ballot of the 70 nurses working in the unit. Industrial action could include working to rule, a ban on overtime or refusing to treat patients in places nurses consider unsuitable. The full RCN council is expected to support the proposal within the next 10 days. If the hospital does not move quickly to solve the problem, it could be the first to be targeted since the RCN changed its rules in 1995 to permit limited industrial action that did not affect patient care. Patricia Marquis, the union's regional officer, said: \"For several years, conditions have become more and more difficult [at John Radcliffe]. There have been increasing numbers of patients and, partly because of the nurse shortages, fewer beds.\" It was common for every corridor to be full of people waiting on trolleys, but the overcrowding reached crisis proportions 10 days ago when the unit held three times the approved maximum number of patients. \"This means the nurses cannot give patients the best care, or even privacy and dignity, and safety is being compromised.\" Last year the nurses made a formal complaint to the trust management and a panel upheld their complaints, Ms Marquis said. But an action plan was not fully implemented and problems continued. \"The nurses are at the end of their tether and now feel this ballot is their only course,\" Ms Marquis said. David Highton, the hospital's chief executive, said: \"I understand the frustrations of our accident and emergency staff and am deeply concerned about the difficulties they face. \"It is no great secret that the emergency care system in Oxfordshire has been very stretched recently. \"I will continue to talk to the RCN and to our own staff about how we can work together to relieve some of the pressures and improve the system as a whole.\" The hospital serves more than 600,000 people in the Oxford area. A report last year on its heart unit criticised a \"culture of cronyism\" that left the centre in chaos. Personality clashes between doctors left the unit \"on its knees\" and threatened its future, the report said.",

Ministers now face fresh accusations that, albeit inadvertently, they misled MPs over the crash of the Chinook helicopter on the Mull of Kintyre in June 1994. Four aircrew and 25 senior members of the Northern Ireland anti-terrorism community were killed in Chinook Zulu Delta 576 on their way to a high-level security conference near Inverness. Two air marshals blamed the experienced special forces pilots, Flight Lieutenants Jonathan Tapper and Rick Cook - finding them guilty of gross negligence. Since then, ministers and officials have doggedly stuck by the line that a catalogue of technical problems in the newly-upgraded Chinook fleet were \"trivial\" and could not have endangered an aircraft. But the latest leaked documents, obtained by Computer Weekly magazine and passed to the Guardian, contradict this claim. One, dated 1997, stated explicitly that one of the problems - the computerised engine control system misinterpreting an air pressure signal and limiting the engine power available - could have jeopardised an aircraft. The second leaked document referred to upgrades to the control system carried out in late 1994 - within months of the ZD576 crash - to correct nine software anomolies. In August 1999, the armed forces ministers, John Spellar, listed the modifications in reply to a parliamentary question from Desmond Swayne, Tory MP for New Forest West. Last night, Mr Swayne said he was \"outraged\" by the new evidence. He is considering raising a point of order on the floor of the Commons to establish whether he was misled. On Monday, the Lords is to vote on a motion by the former Labour foreign affairs minister, Lord Chalfont, to set up a select committee to investigate the crash.

      "bodyText": "The two survivors of the Dover lorry tragedy in which 58 Chinese illegal immigrants died spoke yesterday for the first time of the panic that gripped the 60 people packed into the airtight container as they began to suffocate. Speaking on the fourth day of the trial of Perry Wacker, a Dutch lorry driver charged with 58 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants, Ke Su Di and Ke Shi Guang, the only survivors of the doomed human cargo, described the scenes in the lorry. Wacker, 32, and a translator, Ying Guo, 29, of South Woodford, London, who is charged with conspiracy to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants, deny the charges. The survivors, who are under police protection, told how a vent, the only source of oxygen, was closed before the lorry boarded a Zeebrugge to Dover ferry last year. Speaking behind a screen and through an interpreter, Ke Shi Guang, 22, broke down as he described how they pounded the side of the lorry and screamed for help as they gasped for breath. \"Did there come a time when those in the container started to become distressed?\" he was asked by Victor Temple QC for the Crown. \"Yes.\" \"Others were having great difficulty breathing?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did all of you bang on the side of the container, shout and ask for help?\" \"Yes,\" he said, sobbing. Ke Su Di, 20, told the court that within two or three hours of the vent being closed some people began to pass out in the darkness. \"People began to panic because the window was shut and there was no air,\" he said. He had been one of the last people loaded on to the lorry in the Netherlands and so was close to the load of tomatoes used to conceal their presence at the back of the container. \"I wanted to breathe air so I got close to the tomatoes but I do not think they were any use.\" He said other people in the container also tried getting close to the tomatoes, but when this did not work everyone started screaming and shouting for help. \"Some people removed tomatoes and wanted to kick open the doors. \"There was also a lot of shouting and screaming but nobody came to help.\" He passed out and the next thing he recalled was being dragged from the lorry at Dover by customs officials around four hours later. Both survivors had paid up to 230,000RMB (\u00a320,000) to a Snakehead gang to be transported to Britain. On June 18 they began the final leg of their journey. The group of 60 gathered at a warehouse in Rotterdam after spending around three days in two safe houses in the city. They were driven in two small vans, one resembling an ambulance, which had the windows blacked out with paper. The group were loaded aboard the lorry and four containers of water were passed up to them. The tomatoes were then loaded and the doors sealed. The group had been told that at some point on the journey the air vent would be closed to prevent them being heard by customs or police, the jury at Maidstone crown court was told. \"We were told if this window is open you can speak in very low voices, but if it is closed then you do not speak.\" Both survivors were carrying a piece of paper bearing Ms Ying's name and her telephone number.

He said if you were arrested over there [the UK] you call this number. This person will come to bail you,\" Ke Shi Guang said. Ke Su Di told the court that his journey to Britain had begun 11 days previously on June 7 when he travelled to Beijing from his home province of Fujian and boarded a plane bound for Moscow. His parents paid a local Snakehead gang a downpayment of 10,000RMB, the equivalent of 10 months' pay. The remaining payment of 220,000RMB was payable on his arrival in the UK. If it was not made, the court heard, he would be locked up by the Snakeheads and retribution would follow. \"If the money was not paid then I'm in the hands of the Snakeheads, I'm the one in real danger,\" he said.

Nicholas Blake QC, who is, with Cherie Booth QC, a founder member of the Matrix chambers which specialises in human rights cases, drew media fire for taking a fee to represent the interim regime, installed after a coup. The democratically elected government of Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, was overturned last May. Geoffrey Robertson QC, from the rival Doughty Street chambers, acted free of charge on behalf of Chandrika Prasad, an ethnic Indian peasant farmer challenging the legality of the regime. Mr Blake, who has an impeccable record defending vulnerable groups like asylum seekers against the state, yesterday accused his critics of misunderstanding the issues. He said his clients had promised before the appeal was heard that they would abide by the result, and the legal process in which he had played a part had hastened the likely return of democracy to Fiji, through fresh elections. Both Ratu Josefa Iloilo, the acting president, and Laisenia Qarase, the interim prime minister, made public pledges to work towards a return to constitutional rule after the judgment. \"Let us proceed to deal calmly and quietly with the court's decision,\" Mr Iloilo said in a televised address.

If the parliament is recalled then swiftly dismissed by the president, observers believe that Mr Qarase's government will continue, with the inclusion of some new faces to give it an appearance of national unity, until a general election is held. Mr Chaudhry, who was held hostage by Mr Speight for 56 days and deposed by the military's declaration of martial law, yesterday declared he was still the prime minister of Fiji. Mr Chaudhry, now in exile, will return to the Fijian capital Suva by the weekend, but analysts said he lacked support within his party for a return to power. The 1997 constitution allows for the creation of a government of national unity, with all parties commanding more than 10% support entitled to join the cabinet. Mr Chaudhry has said he would not serve with any politicians linked to the coup, ruling out his participation in any national coalition. The 1997 constitution gave ethnic Indians the same political rights as Fijians. Most ethnic Indians, who constitute 44% of the islands' 800,000 population, are descendants of the sugar plantation workers who arrived in the late 19th century.

      "bodyText": "A taxi van that had unwittingly carried a Palestinian bomber and his lethal cargo of explosives across a swath of Israel blew up at a road block in Galilee yesterday, killing one person and injuring nine. Israeli television said the taxi had been boarded by at least one Palestinian bomber near Tel Aviv, and that its other passengers - who were Jews as well as Arabs - had no idea they were riding alongside a 2kg bomb. It was not immediately clear whether the dead man was one of the bombers. Police said they had been hunting a Palestinian militant cell for 24 hours, after sappers defused an explosive device planted on a busy street in central Tel Aviv. The bomb, like yesterday's, was designed to be detonated by a mobile phone. The bomber is believed to have detonated yesterday's bomb after the taxi was pulled over at a roadblock near the Arab town of Umm al-Fahim in northern Galilee. The force of the blast blew the roof off the white taxi van and shattered the windscreens of passing vehicles. It also sheared the legs off one suspected militant, who police said was a Palestinian man from the town of Jenin, in the West Bank. He had confessed to plotting Wednesday's thwarted attack, police said, which was claimed by the previously unknown group, called the \"Return Brigades\". \"I heard a loud explosion .. I saw body parts, someone's hand,\" David Grosser, a lorry driver at the scene, said. \"Everyone was in shock. I cried myself for half an hour. Today it's me, tomorrow it's you.\" No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but as in past attacks inside the borders of the Jewish state during this five-month Palestinian uprising, Israeli officials accused Yasser Arafat of indirect responsibility. The outgoing deputy defence minister, Efraim Sneh, said Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority had failed to rein in Islamic Jihad militants, who have claimed some of the bombings during the past five months, or Hamas. \"As long as activists of Hamas and the Jihad are walking around free in the West Bank and Gaza, the responsibility is on those who let them walk around freely,\" Mr Sneh said. \"We see the Palestinian Authority as responsible for the situation.\" Yesterday's attack comes as Israel's hardline prime minister-elect, Ariel Sharon, enters the final stages of assembling a national unity government which is expected to act even more harshly against the Palestinian uprising. In recent days, Mr Sharon's advisers have called for an acceleration of the assassination of Palestinian leaders, and for deepening the siege on the West Bank and Gaza. Their demands grew even more strident yesterday. \"We can not talk English here, this is the Middle East,\" said Meir Sheetrit, a senior leader of Mr Sharon's Likud party, yesterday. \"Here we have to talk Arabic.\" On Wednesday, Israel's army chief, Shaul Mofaz, said the military would even consider reoccupying the areas of the West Bank and Gaza now under Palestinian rule. Gen Mofaz's statements to visiting Jewish leaders met an angry response from Palestinian security officials yesterday. \"He should know that the worst kind of terrorism and violence is the occupation,\" said Jibril Rajoub, the leader of the Palestinian security apparatus in the West Bank.",

      "bodyText": "An international legal net began closing on Slobodan Milosevic yesterday after it was confirmed that \u00a3730,000 of gold was shipped from a state-run mine in Serbia to Switzerland as the former Yugoslav leader was being toppled last year. The Swiss authorities said that import-export companies based in Greece and Cyprus exported 173kg of unrefined gold bars from the state-run Bor mines between September 21 and November 2 last year. The gold was sold to a Swiss firm for resale on the open market. Earlier press reports had prompted Serbian prosecutors to take their first direct legal steps against Mr Milosevic on Wednesday by ordering a police inquiry into allegations that he had profited from the gold transaction. Othmar Wyss, the head of trade sanctions at the Swiss economics ministry, admitted yesterday that it was unusual that the gold sale was not made by the Yugoslav central bank, which effectively owns the mine. \"We are investigating if the Swiss company violated sanctions,\" he said. The gold was checked by Swiss customs when it arrived, in Z\u00fcrich in four shipments, on regular Swissair flights, and was taken to a reprocessing plant in southern Switzerland. Mr Wyss said the exports were not illegal and the gold deal would only have fallen foul of an embargo in force in western Europe at the time if the proceeds were paid to Yugoslav state-run enterprises, including the central bank, Mr Milosevic or about 600 Serbs on a European blacklist. No formal link has been established with the former Yugoslav regime but there are strong suspicions that Mr Milosevic and his associates used Cyprus as a base for millions siphoned from their country's economy. About a hundred bank accounts were frozen in Switzerland last spring under the Europe-wide embargo, although none were in Mr Milosevic's name, Swiss officials said. Greece has rejected claims that funds from the sale allegedly linked to Mr Milosevic were deposited in the country. \"As far as Greece is concerned, I want to categorically refute this,\" foreign ministry spokesman Panagiotis Beglitis said. \"All the investigations do not indicate this.\" Bank accounts of people connected with the Milosevic regime containing \"a very low amount of money\" have already been frozen, Mr Beglitis said. As legal moves against Mr Milosevic in Serbia gathered steam, an associate said he would ignore any summons to appear for questioning. \"Milosevic told me personally that he'll never answer to any court subpoena,\" Sinisa Vucinic, an official of the Yugoslav neo-communist party led by Mr Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, said. Dozens of diehard supporters near Mr Milosevic's house in Belgrade yesterday, vowing to protect the ex-president. \"We will protect our supreme commander and hero with all available means,\" Mr Vucinic said. \"From Kosovo alone, 50,000 rifles and heavy weapons were transferred and distributed to citizens.\" The investigation ordered by the Belgrade prosecutor's office could lead to charges ranging from corruption to war crimes, but the new democratic Yugoslav government has refused to hand Mr Milosevic to the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, claiming that the court is biased. The US has given the new authorities in Belgrade until the end of the month to start cooperating with the war crimes tribunal, or risk losing millions of dollars in aid, as well as membership of international financial organisations. The chief war crimes prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, said European aid to Yugoslavia should also be linked to cooperation with her court.",

      "body": "<p>In the spring of 1994, I met a man by the name of John Murphy, who was homeless on the streets of New York. He would always talk about the tunnels under the city, and how he wanted to go and live down there because he was sick of the situation up top - the nights that he spent in the parks and on the pavements of the city, he would get almost no rest. The cops would wake him up and tell him to move on, or it would rain and he would get wet, or he was afraid of the kids who might come along and set him on fire, or he was afraid of losing his things to thieves. He was tired. He was tired of being tired. He told me that, in the tunnels, you could build yourself a house and have electricity. He heard that you could be left alone to be homeless in peace. But he had never gone there. </p> <p>The idea of there being tunnels underneath the city where people were living fascinated me. It was deep in the realms of urban myth, and I wanted to know the reality I knew must be lurking behind it. I decided to go exploring. I went into just about every type of tunnel imaginable: train tunnels, both active and abandoned, steam tunnels, electric tunnels and subway tunnels. If there was a hole in the ground, I went into it. People would see me jumping down on the tracks and watch me disappear into the darkness. </p> <p>After a month of this, I came across a long stretch of tunnel that belonged to Amtrak. It had around 100 people living in it. This tunnel was very different to the others. After stumbling around in the darkness for a bit, I decided I would come back the next day and try to get to know some of the people living there. </p> <p>I never had any intention of making a film. It wasn't even my idea to do Dark Days. It really happened one night when a group of us were sitting around a fire in the tunnel. We were laughing at something that had happened that day, when one of the guys turned around and said: \"Man, someone should be making a film about this.\" Someone laughed. \"Why don't we do it?\" I said. It was that simple. What I proposed is that we would make a film, sell it, and the money would get everyone out of the tunnel. I had never touched a movie camera. I had never even seen one. Asking around, it seemed that everyone in the tunnel had even less of an idea about film-making than I did. Where do you start? </p> <p>The tunnel stretched more than 50 blocks, about three miles. During the day, it is very dark, as almost no daylight squeezes through the iron gratings set high in the ceiling. At night it is pitch black. I knew we would need power for the lights, if there was going to be any filming. We needed to run a lot of electric cable. Miraculously, we did manage to \"find\" 40 blocks' worth of the stuff in one of the many construction sites we scoured each night. Under the cover of darkness, we carried it back to the tunnel. </p> <p>My electrician and chief builder was Henry. He was 62, had lived in the tunnel for five years and knew one or two things about getting by on the town's supply. With no apparent regard for the dangers of massive voltage, he prised open a largesilver box which ticked sinisterly, and set about splicing our cable into the two-inch wires that lay within. Sparks flew everywhere. Henry didn't flinch. We had tapped into the city's power. </p> <p>There was a set of abandoned train tracks that lay parallel to some of the houses that were built along the tunnel. I wanted to build something to roll smoothly along the tracks holding the camera, two people and all the lights. In the business, they call it a dolly; it's big, heavy and very expensive. I mentioned this to Henry and he told me it shouldn't be too much of a problem. </p> <p>The next day I woke up and stepped out of my house to clean my teeth (being in the tunnel is like camping - it is easier to spit the toothpaste on the ground outside). Looking down the track, I noticed a small fire burning in the distance. It was Henry. He had cut a few pieces of wood to length and was heating up a couple of metal rods in the fire. When the rods were red hot, he took them out and, pushing them through the wood, he burnt holes, tooling the basic components of my dolly. He then took the wheels from a shopping cart and bolted them to the base he had constructed. Within hours we were ready to roll. </p> <p>We needed a camera. I had found a little yellow book that listed all the different production facilities in New York. I looked up cameras. The first place on the list was called Cinevision. Being close to my apartment, I decided to walk over there and check it out. When I walked into the place, a man came over and introduced himself as Laurie Drake. He asked me what I needed. I told him about the people I had met in the tunnel and what I wanted to do, and that I needed to get a film camera. He picked a camera out of a glass case and started to show me, step by step, how to operate it. He taught me the basics of what it would take to put an image on film, and then watched me walk out of his building dragging $40,000 worth of camera and lenses. We had only known each other for about three hours but, for some reason, Laurie trusted me and believed in what I was trying to do. I kept a Cinevision camera on and off for the next two and a half years, and I have still never seen a bill. </p> <p>Back in the tunnel, everybody got given film jobs according to their area of expertise. In any group of homeless people, each one has often worked at some kind of a trade. Henry had worked on the railroad, he knew electricity, he was the builder, dolly wrangler and lighting guy. Ralph was the soundman, rigging the mike boom and so on. I started as the only one to do anything that involved the camera, but after a few weeks the crew was so good that they would ask me where I wanted to shoot that day. I would tell them. By the time I arrived, they had set up the lights, loaded the camera and would be standing around impatiently waiting to start. We all got the hang of it pretty fast. </p> <p>After a while, Ralph mentioned that although we had been shooting for ages, nobody knew if we had captured a single image on film. Looking around Ralph's house I saw what he was talking about - there were cans of exposed film everywhere, people were sitting on stacks of them while they sipped their coffee. We had to bite the bullet and see what we had got. </p> <p>I pulled out the yellow production guide and fingered the first lab on the list. We went over. They talked us through the steps. It was going to take a few days to process all the film, and those were anxious days. I eventually went up to screen the footage - alone, terrified we were going to have nothing. What would I tell the guys? To begin with there were muddy, underexposed images crossing the screen, then harsh overexposures. Suddenly we locked in. The pictures were clean, crisp and looked luminescent, otherworldly. It was pure jubilation. I ran back to the tunnel, shouting as I stumbled along in the darkness: \"We did it! It's beautiful! We have a movie!\" </p> <p>I look back now and I see that that was really only the beginning. After that there were more good times and some really tough times as well. There were times when we didn't shoot film for weeks: we would regularly run out of cash, and so there was no way of buying film stock to shoot. In the beginning, I had been using credit cards, maxing out as many as they would send me. After that, I sold off all the contents of my apartment. The last thing to go was the bed. During editing, we ran out of money and couldn't touch the film for 18 months. I found myself homeless, eating out of the garbage. The process took me to places inside myself that I never knew were there. </p> <p>When we sat around the fire fantasising about our movie seven years ago, we never dreamed it would travel over the ocean to the big screen in Britain. Who would have thought it? But here it is - and, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you like it. </p> <p>Dark Days is released next Friday.</p>",

Looking around Ralph's house I saw what he was talking about - there were cans of exposed film everywhere, people were sitting on stacks of them while they sipped their coffee. We had to bite the bullet and see what we had got. I pulled out the yellow production guide and fingered the first lab on the list. We went over. They talked us through the steps. It was going to take a few days to process all the film, and those were anxious days. I eventually went up to screen the footage - alone, terrified we were going to have nothing. What would I tell the guys? To begin with there were muddy, underexposed images crossing the screen, then harsh overexposures. Suddenly we locked in. The pictures were clean, crisp and looked luminescent, otherworldly. It was pure jubilation. I ran back to the tunnel, shouting as I stumbled along in the darkness: \"We did it! It's beautiful! We have a movie!\" I look back now and I see that that was really only the beginning. After that there were more good times and some really tough times as well. There were times when we didn't shoot film for weeks: we would regularly run out of cash, and so there was no way of buying film stock to shoot. In the beginning, I had been using credit cards, maxing out as many as they would send me. After that, I sold off all the contents of my apartment. The last thing to go was the bed. During editing, we ran out of money and couldn't touch the film for 18 months. I found myself homeless, eating out of the garbage. The process took me to places inside myself that I never knew were there. When we sat around the fire fantasising about our movie seven years ago, we never dreamed it would travel over the ocean to the big screen in Britain. Who would have thought it? But here it is - and, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you like it. Dark Days is released next Friday.",

      "body": "<p>I t's late July on the Cephallonia set of Captain Corelli's Mandolin, and Penelope Cruz is sitting in her trailer trying to set fire to a cigarette, with little success. She is wearing a peasant dress, her hair pinned under a matching cream scarf dappled with faded pink flowers. She's talking about Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and the nickname they have given her, and she is laughing. \"It started because Ben speaks Spanish and so does Matt,\" she says. \"So we were talking Spanish and Ben was correcting me in Spanish. He was saying, \"No, no! The word for 'problem', is not problema; it's troubl\u00e9 .' And I was like, 'Ben, I was born in Madrid. The word troubl\u00e9 does not exist.' She laughs again. \"So now they call me troubl\u00e9 . But it fits me, also.\" </p> <p>At 26, Cruz is poised to become one of the few European actresses since Sophia Loren - and the first Spanish actress ever - to attain enduring American stardom. The odds are stacked against this of course. Only an elite handful - Garbo, Dietrich, Bergman and Hepburn among them - have accomplished this. But if Cruz's current run of high-profile projects - Captain Corelli, the forthcoming adaptation of All the Pretty Horses, opposite Damon - she has no intention of leaving quietly. \"Sometimes, somebody comes along who has such a magic, it doesn't matter if she has an accent,\" says Billy Bob Thornton, who directed All the Pretty Horses. \"She's going to have a very, very long career. She's too strong to hold down.\" </p> <p>When it comes to managing the ordinary details of her life, Cruz is, well, kind of a mess. \"If I would have all of my papers tied up, I would get dizzy. I would throw up,\" she says. \"But I think you find your own order in that craziness. Like, the way I travel? I don't know how I do it! I'm always late. I hear the flight is leaving, and I just sit on the floor and listen to my music.\" She laughs, and then shrugs. \"You find your own rhythm.\" </p> <p>It would be easy to think that this laissez-faire attitude is simply the by-product of fame. It's not difficult to operate on \"your own rhythm\" when an assistant packs your bags and finds your passport, when planes actually wait for you. So has she always been so... \"Flaky?\" suggests her agent of six years, Brandt Joel. \"Always. A couple of times she was late for meetings I was taking her to. So one time I said, \"I'll pick you up at one o'clock. She doesn't drive. And I picked her up at 1.30. I said, 'See how it feels?' She got it.\" </p> <p>She is not, however, lackadaisical about her career. Hollywood didn't exactly come panting to Cruz's door. \"I looked for it,\" she says, finally getting her cigarette lighter to work. \"It was not about finishing one career (in Spain) and starting a new one. It's a continuation of what I started: to find more possibilities, more interesting characters, more stories.\" But the transition proved difficult. Joel says she spoke three words of English when she auditioned for the lead opposite Keanu Reaves in 1995's A Walk In The Clouds. (The role eventually went to Aitana Sanchez-Gijon). Lesson learned, she hit the books and found, oddly, that acting in a foreign language has its benefits. \"It gives you an additional kind of freedom because you don't hear yourself so much,\" she says. \"With that freedom, I can take more risks. There is not so much self-criticism, which can destroy a performance.\" </p> <p>Cruz is the eldest of three children (her sister is 23; her brother 15), raised in a house about 15 minutes outside Madrid. Her mother ran a beauty salon. \"I grew up observing women,\" she says, \"all those different women, different attitudes, coming there to be pretty. I used to sit there and observe how they related to each other, to my mother. It was very interesting. It was like a good acting school.\" </p> <p>Although her English has improved over the years, she still speaks in Spanish cadences, and her consonants are so soft that every word sounds whispered. \"I had some very happy periods,\" she says. \"I am happier now because I don't have so many fears. My first fear was about the devil, when I was around fire, something I saw in a movie. I think it's about pain, in whichever form it comes. I had a lot of energy as a child - sometimes too much - and I didn't know how to channel it. It was making me suffer. It was bigger than myself, and I was very young.\" She sighs and puts her chin in her hand. \"It was a difficult time, no?\" </p> <p>Her parents signed her up for ballet classes when she was four. But by the time she reached early adolescence, the endless hours of being on her toes had lost their charm. \"It's a very sadistic thing,\" she says. \"You get used to bleeding and smiling at the same time.\" She had been studying theatre for a few years, and as the dancing faded out, acting took centre stage. Almost instantly, at 14, Cruz began working in films. \"I found a lot of magic in it, a lot of order to that chaos,\" she says. \"I felt like a child. I was completely in love with it. I still feel like that. You can always keep learning with acting, because the school is life and yourself and your friends and your relationships. I'm fascinated by it! Its infinito!\" </p> <p>The 1992 release of Jamon Jamon proved to be the only dark spot in her bright new world. A hypersexual hit in her native Spain, the film transformed her into a national fantasy - a tousled, naked, writhing minx. She was 17, suddenly a star, and she was scared. \"There was some strong energy around me, and I didn't know how to handle it,\" Cruz says. And so she decided to sever the symbol of her eroticism. \"I had a strong rejection of anything sexual or sensual for a while. I cut my hair very, very short. I didn't do any love scenes, not even kisses, for many years. I was told by everyone, 'You are risking your career.' But I followed my heart, and I never regret that.\" She sighs. \"No one forced me to [make the movie]. I felt very happy doing it. But I also suffered for it.\" </p> <p>When Cruz speaks like this, it's as if she's reliving the pain and fear. This ability to recall her emotional past imbues her acting with a raw immediacy. The problem is that she can't switch it off when the cameras stop rolling. \"When I first start a movie, the first day, I feel like a duck,\" she says. \"I feel clumsy, like I don't belong to it. I have fear every day, every night when I go to sleep and I have to do a scene that I'm scared of. I don't think that goes away.\" And than there are the recurring dreams - the one where she is running but can't move; the ones where someone is hitting her again and again in the kidneys. </p> <p>\"I don't think her life is that easy,\" Thornton says. \"She cares so much about things, and she stresses herself out constantly and stays in a state of nerves all the time... She and I share a lot of the same fears and phobias. Matt, too, for that matter.\" </p> <p>While Cruz was filming Captain Corelli, the rumor that she and Damon had forged an on-set romance during the making of Horses was new, and at the time it seemed amusing to her. Asked about Damon, she batted her eyelashes with exaggerated innocence. \"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" she said. \"He's amazing, but those things are not true. What is amazing is the way some people ask you sometimes...\" She dropped her voice to an intense whisper. \"'Tell me the truth. It is true?' Who cares? Because we have this job, we are to say to everybody what we do, or with whom we sleep?\" She shrugged and smiled. \"It's a bit absurd, but that's why everybody lies so much.\" </p> <p>Five months later, when I caught up with her in New York, it was not funny anymore. She had become protective of her privacy. The Damon rumours had been replaced by reports that she and Cage were an item - about him, she said only that \"he gives so much as an actor. Every day is a surprise.\" Last month, she had to deny emphatically that she was having an affair with Tom Cruise after he announced his separation from Nicole Kidman. </p> <p> F or years now, Cruz has been quietly assisting Mother Teresa's charity work in Calcutta, through a Spanish organisation called the Sabera Foundation. Last year, in her brief time off between movies, Cruz travelled from LA to India to make a documentary about the housing that has been built for homeless children. (The proceeds from the documentary will then be used to build more homes.) \"Calcutta is like another world,\" she says. \"People there are very special and grateful. It was an amazing experience.\" She pauses. \"I feel it is dangerous to talk about these things in interviews because they can be misunderstood. I want to make it clear that it's not about me.\" Perhaps, but her empathy exacts a heavy toll on her nonetheless. \"This time in India, I was only there for two days, and there was no time to digest it,\" she says. \"You see things that...\" Her voice breaks. \"When I come back, I come down like a I had a big crisis.\" </p> <p>\"She'll travel anywhere to help people,\" Thornton says. \"I mean, she'll run herself into the ground to go someplace for somebody. Look, we're making the movies we want to make: we're making money to support our families; we're the luckiest people in the world. But she just cares so deeply that I think it'll be her downfall. This is a long-winded way of saying that she's co-dependent. And it makes life pretty tough sometimes.\" </p> <p>She has spent most of her adult life being someone's girlfriend - presumably arguing part of the time - and so, recently, Cruz says, she decided to step off the relationship track and come to terms with herself. \"I think it will be better when I get involved with someone again, because I made this time for me,\" she says. \"I haven't really been single for a while, and I think it's been good for me, to lose the fear to be like this.\" </p> <p>Of course, as always with Cruz, as one anxiety dissolves another emerges. \"But what if I get used to it?\" she asks, her dark eyes widening. \"That's the danger.\" </p> <p>From Premiere magazine \u00a9 2001 Hachette Filipacchi.

He was not an original selection for that tour, but seized his chance when the two chosen scrum-halves, Dickie Jeeps and Stan Coughtrie, were injured, creating a memorable blind-side try in the final Test for his great friend, Tony O'Reilly.</p> <p>He and O'Reilly were the life and soul of the tour party, O'Reilly with his mimicry and Mulligan with his guitar. O'Reilly said: \"He had real pace, a lancing break, a superb pass and was a fine reader of the game. But most important, he was a joyful character, a vaudevillian.\"</p> <p>Mulligan is described in an official rugby history as \"a slim, willowy figure who developed into a fine attacking player, and whose elegant running and passing made him one of the outstanding scrum-halves of the late-1950s\". In his first game for Ireland, a week before he was 20, he played at Stade Colombes, in Paris, alongside the legendary fly-half Jackie Kyle. He took part in Ireland's first victory over a touring team from the southern hemisphere when they beat Australia 9-6 at Lansdowne Road in 1958.</p> <p>Mulligan's playing career was nearly ended at its peak when he became a professional rugby writer. This was in contravention of the rules at the time, and there were cries from diehards for him to be banned. In the end, the Irish Rugby Union decided that, since journalism was then his fulltime occupation, he should be allowed to continue playing - a decision that opened the door for the many players who write about the game today.</p> <p>Mulligan played at club level for London Irish and Wanderers, the Dublin team, but gave up international rugby at the age of 25 because of his burgeoning business interests. Although quintessentially Irish, with his easy manner, his stories, his quick wit and his gift for making friends and enjoying life - his clubs were Annabel's, the Hawks and the Kildare Street in Dublin - he lived his life mostly overseas, in Paris, Brussels and Washington.</p> <p>Born in India to Irish parents, Mulligan was educated in England at Gresham's school, Holt, and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he read geography and anthropology. After a brief time with the Irish Export Board, mostly looking up old rugby pals in Australia and New Zealand, he spent six years as a Paris correspondent for the Observer and the Daily Telegraph. He was not a notable success in this role, a contemporary recalling that \"rugby opened many doors for him, but he didn't always know what to ask when he got inside them\".</p> <p>He also had a spell at ITN and worked for four years on the BBC Panorama programme, where his pale good looks and lilting accent made him a natural for television. He then went to Brussels as head of the general reports division of the European Community, publisher of Europe magazine and, later, director of the commission's press and information delegation to the United States.</p> <p>After leaving this role in unclear circumstances in 1982, he stayed on in Washington, setting up his own company, Mulligan Communications, which utilised his many contacts around the world. He was also involved in European Satellite Radio and the EuroMedia group, and was director for 25 years of the American-Ireland Fund.</p> <p>Mulligan was a gregarious man, whose interests included tennis, skiing, sailing and a special skill at landscape painting. He moved to Portland, Oregon, with his wife Pia and son Finn six months ago. They survive him, together with another son and two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Armstrong Mulligan, businessman, Eurocrat and rugby player, born February 4 1936; died February 24 2001</p>",

Mulligan, who has died aged 65, won three blues at Cambridge, 22 caps for Ireland between 1956 and 1961, three of them as captain, and starred in the Lions' historic victory over the All Blacks at Auckland in 1959. He was not an original selection for that tour, but seized his chance when the two chosen scrum-halves, Dickie Jeeps and Stan Coughtrie, were injured, creating a memorable blind-side try in the final Test for his great friend, Tony O'Reilly. He and O'Reilly were the life and soul of the tour party, O'Reilly with his mimicry and Mulligan with his guitar. O'Reilly said: \"He had real pace, a lancing break, a superb pass and was a fine reader of the game. But most important, he was a joyful character, a vaudevillian.\" Mulligan is described in an official rugby history as \"a slim, willowy figure who developed into a fine attacking player, and whose elegant running and passing made him one of the outstanding scrum-halves of the late-1950s\". In his first game for Ireland, a week before he was 20, he played at Stade Colombes, in Paris, alongside the legendary fly-half Jackie Kyle. He took part in Ireland's first victory over a touring team from the southern hemisphere when they beat Australia 9-6 at Lansdowne Road in 1958. Mulligan's playing career was nearly ended at its peak when he became a professional rugby writer. This was in contravention of the rules at the time, and there were cries from diehards for him to be banned. In the end, the Irish Rugby Union decided that, since journalism was then his fulltime occupation, he should be allowed to continue playing - a decision that opened the door for the many players who write about the game today. Mulligan played at club level for London Irish and Wanderers, the Dublin team, but gave up international rugby at the age of 25 because of his burgeoning business interests. Although quintessentially Irish, with his easy manner, his stories, his quick wit and his gift for making friends and enjoying life - his clubs were Annabel's, the Hawks and the Kildare Street in Dublin - he lived his life mostly overseas, in Paris, Brussels and Washington. Born in India to Irish parents, Mulligan was educated in England at Gresham's school, Holt, and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he read geography and anthropology. After a brief time with the Irish Export Board, mostly looking up old rugby pals in Australia and New Zealand, he spent six years as a Paris correspondent for the Observer and the Daily Telegraph. He was not a notable success in this role, a contemporary recalling that \"rugby opened many doors for him, but he didn't always know what to ask when he got inside them\". He also had a spell at ITN and worked for four years on the BBC Panorama programme, where his pale good looks and lilting accent made him a natural for television. He then went to Brussels as head of the general reports division of the European Community, publisher of Europe magazine and, later, director of the commission's press and information delegation to the United States. After leaving this role in unclear circumstances in 1982, he stayed on in Washington, setting up his own company, Mulligan Communications, which utilised his many contacts around the world. He was also involved in European Satellite Radio and the EuroMedia group, and was director for 25 years of the American-Ireland Fund. Mulligan was a gregarious man, whose interests included tennis, skiing, sailing and a special skill at landscape painting. He moved to Portland, Oregon, with his wife Pia and son Finn six months ago. They survive him, together with another son and two daughters. \u0095 Andrew Armstrong Mulligan, businessman, Eurocrat and rugby player, born February 4 1936; died February 24 2001",

Mr Clinton's former chief of staff John Podesta told a congressional committee yesterday that both he and \"the entire White House counsel's office\" opposed the Rich pardon in the weeks leading up to January 20 this year, when Mr Rich was among 141 beneficiaries of presidential pardons issued on Mr Clinton's last morning in the White House. Mr Podesta told the House of Representatives government reform committee how he had repeatedly told Mr Rich's lawyers during December and January that a pardon was unlikely, adding that he himself \"strongly opposed\" it. But Mr Podesta then went on to give a glimpse of the force of the international lobbying effort on Mr Rich's behalf, coordinated from the top of the Israeli government, implying that it was this pressure which led to the former president's controversial decision. A few days before Mr Clinton left office, the Israeli foreign minister Schlomo Ben-Ami lobbied King Juan Carlos during a visit to Madrid, who then contacted the White House through an intermediary. Mr Clinton was also lobbied by Mr Barak and the veteran Israeli leader Shimon Peres on the eve of his departure. \"These were men he respected and they were asking him to look at it,\" Mr Podesta said yesterday. \"One could disagree with his reasoning, as many have.

All three aides denied under oath that there had been any \"quid pro quo\" in the decision to pardon Mr Rich. The evidence came amid fresh evidence of behind-the-scenes lobbying efforts for pardons by Hillary Clinton's brothers, and in a markedly more partisan political atmosphere, with Democrats charging congressional Republicans with double standards and selective indignation. A week after revelations that Hillary Clinton's brother Hugh Rodham had returned $400,000 that he received for lobbying for two January 2001 pardons, it emerged yesterday that her other brother, Tony Rodham, had successfully lobbied for pardons for a Tennessee couple convicted of bank fraud in 1982, who were major campaign contributors - notably to Mrs Clinton's Senate campaign. The increasingly partisan tone of the Capitol Hill hearings into the Clinton pardons was underlined yesterday when Republicans insisted that Mrs Rich's friend Beth Dozoretz, a close Clinton friend, should make a public show of her refusal to testify before the committee yesterday. Unlike Mrs Rich, who two weeks ago pleaded her \"fifth amendment\" right not to testify through her lawyer, Ms Dozoretz faced a media scrum as she formally refused to answer any questions. The senior Democrat on the committee accused Republicans of \"creating a media spectacle\" out of yesterday's hearings.",

In 1967, there were 23 outbreaks after the first week, roughly the same as today with 33 in the first 10 days. But in 1967 numbers exploded in week two, with 104 separate outbreaks, followed by 222 in the third week, rising to a peak of 490 in seven days at the end of November. From then on there was a slow decline over several months.</p> <p>Mr Scudamore said he was cautiously optimistic because none of the newer outbreaks have been in pigs.

The hopes of the Ministry of Agriculture are pinned on a steady decline after March 9 - two weeks after the ban on movement of all farm animals.</p> <p>There are other significant differences between 1967 and 2001 which suggest that the disease will not spread so far. In 1967, most of the outbreaks were in cattle herds, with 211,825 cows slaughtered and just over 100,000 pigs and sheep.

Hundreds of potential cross infections took place in the few days before the ban was introduced, caused by the frenetic trading in fat lambs in markets up and down the country.</p> <p>Because the first outbreak, at Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland, had been infectious for around 14 days before it was discovered last Thursday, a number of infected sheep had been in the market chain for some days and carried hundreds of miles before anyone realised there could be a danger of infection.</p> <p>Lambs with foot and mouth are known to have been mixed with healthy sheep and sold in batches at markets in Hexham, Northumberland, Darlington, Co Durham, Longtown in Cumbria, Welshpool in Powys, and Holsworthy in Devon.

      "body": "<p>Two more inches of snow fell overnight. After the partial thaw yesterday and hard overnight frost, we now have a firm crust of solid snow, which is much harder to clear.</p> <p>We found one of the two lost sheep this morning. We rescued her from the burn and she is now convalescing in a clean, dry stable. The other is still missing. Compared with what many farmers are coping with, one lost sheep is not serious, but we keep looking anyway.</p> <p>I spoke to one farmer's wife this morning and her whole family is suffering. A few of their cattle are suspected of having the dreaded foot and mouth. The test result is due this morning. She has two small children and one of them has been very ill for two weeks with E coli 157. The child is recovering but has to attend the hospital 20 miles away. Their farm is sealed up completely - no one is allowed in or out - so she can only get to the hospital under a strict movement licence from Maff.</p> <p>Only the mother and child as named on the licence may leave. First they have to walk to the car, parked some way from the farm; then disinfect themselves and the vehicle and follow the exact route as mapped by the ministry. She says the waiting for the final confirmation is the worst thing. They have accepted that the livestock will probably go, but the children have a pet pig each and she doesn't know, should the worst happen, how she will tell them.</p> <p>The fear levels in this area, especially the nearer you get to the centre of Infected Area 2, are nearly off the Richter scale today. Telephone helplines of all types have reported a tenfold increase in calls. It is not just the fear of losing your own livestock. The rising levels of terror are often compounded by the uneasy feeling that any movement from the farm risks bringing back the disease - not just to our animals, but to neighbours' also.</p> <p>Some farmers fear they would never be forgiven if that happened, but there should be no blame or shame attached to anyone who becomes the next confirmed case. The whole industry, and each individual livestock holding, remains in great danger.The only way to cope is to follow all the precautions rigorously and call in the ministry if you are even slightly suspicious.</p> <p>I've just had to break off from writing today's entry to deal with a potentially serious development. My husband Peter came rushing in, reeking of disinfectant and in a total fury. The coast-to-coast cycle route runs through here and we have just had someone passing through, despite pleas to keep away.</p> <p>Peter has cleared the mile-long route to the main road, but other access is limited. He can see from the footprints that the cyclist stopped to read the notices at the end of the road but ignored our polite request to keep away. Peter's anxiety, like everyone else's on the cycle route, is that it runs through the infected and restricted area.</p> <p>He has gone to look for the culprit, who pushed his or her way through our outdoor cows who were standing at the closed gate. Whoever it was must have been close enough to our cows, due to calve any day, to feel the warmth of their steamy breath.</p> <p>I've rung the council, the police and the NFU. Hopefully between us we can get a temporary access ban. No locals use the road as it doesn't really go anywhere except to the church, which is closed until the crisis is over. The next house in that direction is three miles away.</p> <p>Another financial loser in all this is the local chimney sweep. He has lost two-thirds of his bookings: no farmer will allow him to enter their premises, just in case.</p> <p>It is no surprise to learn from the Corbridge butcher that British meat supplies are diminishing and that small shops are hardest hit. Jimmy Higginson has five shops in the region and he has been hit by the closure of the Witton-le-Wear abattoir. He collected some frozen belly pork this morning from County Durham to make sausages. The wholesale price had risen from 30p to 75p a pound.</p> <p>Tynedale council's tourism office has just rung me back about the cyclist. They have talked to the police, who told them to ring Maff, who told them to ring its animal health section . . . We'll await the answer.

      "bodyText": "Two more inches of snow fell overnight. After the partial thaw yesterday and hard overnight frost, we now have a firm crust of solid snow, which is much harder to clear. We found one of the two lost sheep this morning. We rescued her from the burn and she is now convalescing in a clean, dry stable. The other is still missing. Compared with what many farmers are coping with, one lost sheep is not serious, but we keep looking anyway. I spoke to one farmer's wife this morning and her whole family is suffering. A few of their cattle are suspected of having the dreaded foot and mouth. The test result is due this morning. She has two small children and one of them has been very ill for two weeks with E coli 157. The child is recovering but has to attend the hospital 20 miles away. Their farm is sealed up completely - no one is allowed in or out - so she can only get to the hospital under a strict movement licence from Maff. Only the mother and child as named on the licence may leave. First they have to walk to the car, parked some way from the farm; then disinfect themselves and the vehicle and follow the exact route as mapped by the ministry. She says the waiting for the final confirmation is the worst thing. They have accepted that the livestock will probably go, but the children have a pet pig each and she doesn't know, should the worst happen, how she will tell them. The fear levels in this area, especially the nearer you get to the centre of Infected Area 2, are nearly off the Richter scale today. Telephone helplines of all types have reported a tenfold increase in calls. It is not just the fear of losing your own livestock. The rising levels of terror are often compounded by the uneasy feeling that any movement from the farm risks bringing back the disease - not just to our animals, but to neighbours' also. Some farmers fear they would never be forgiven if that happened, but there should be no blame or shame attached to anyone who becomes the next confirmed case. The whole industry, and each individual livestock holding, remains in great danger.The only way to cope is to follow all the precautions rigorously and call in the ministry if you are even slightly suspicious. I've just had to break off from writing today's entry to deal with a potentially serious development. My husband Peter came rushing in, reeking of disinfectant and in a total fury. The coast-to-coast cycle route runs through here and we have just had someone passing through, despite pleas to keep away. Peter has cleared the mile-long route to the main road, but other access is limited. He can see from the footprints that the cyclist stopped to read the notices at the end of the road but ignored our polite request to keep away. Peter's anxiety, like everyone else's on the cycle route, is that it runs through the infected and restricted area. He has gone to look for the culprit, who pushed his or her way through our outdoor cows who were standing at the closed gate. Whoever it was must have been close enough to our cows, due to calve any day, to feel the warmth of their steamy breath. I've rung the council, the police and the NFU. Hopefully between us we can get a temporary access ban. No locals use the road as it doesn't really go anywhere except to the church, which is closed until the crisis is over. The next house in that direction is three miles away. Another financial loser in all this is the local chimney sweep. He has lost two-thirds of his bookings: no farmer will allow him to enter their premises, just in case. It is no surprise to learn from the Corbridge butcher that British meat supplies are diminishing and that small shops are hardest hit. Jimmy Higginson has five shops in the region and he has been hit by the closure of the Witton-le-Wear abattoir. He collected some frozen belly pork this morning from County Durham to make sausages. The wholesale price had risen from 30p to 75p a pound. Tynedale council's tourism office has just rung me back about the cyclist. They have talked to the police, who told them to ring Maff, who told them to ring its animal health section . . . We'll await the answer. In the meantime, the next neighbour down the route has gone to look for the culprit. I need to go out for fresh supplies for the humans and animals. I need a haircut, too, but that is a luxury which will have to wait. \u0095 The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

Losses of \u00a3180m from last autumn's floods sliced into profits, preventing Mr Mendelsohn claiming a performance bonus, believed to worth about \u00a3250,000, on top of his \u00a3600,000-plus salary. The company said its underlying financial position strengthened as general insurance premiums such as motor and household insurance rose 17% to \u00a38.4bn and life and pensions business grew 21%. ECB dampens rate cut hopes The European Central Bank yesterday sought to damp down market expectations of an early cut in interest rates despite the worsening outlook for the global economy. The governing council left interest rates in the eurozone on hold at 4.75%, and ECB president Wim Duisenberg indicated that the central bank was no more inclined to cut rates than it had been the previous months. The move brought a sharp response from DGB, the German trade union federation, which warned that the ECB could choke off growth by failing to cut rates. Some analysts warned that the bank might be complacent in its assessment of euroland's ability to shrug off a slowdown in the US. Savings rates reduced Barclays and Nationwide Building Society are among institutions which yesterday cut savings rates following last month's Bank of England's quarter-point base rate cut. Nationwide cut its savings rates by 0.1% to 0.4%, with its online e-Savings account suffering the biggest reduction. Barclays has cut returns on its cash individual savings account and tax-exempt special savings account by between 0.5% and 0.85%. Carlton ad revenue dips Carlton Communications yesterday said it had suffered a 5% drop in advertising revenues from its ITV business in the first four months of the company's financial year. Michael Green, Carlton's chairman, described the advertising market as subdued, and warned that it would be unlikely to pick up until the autumn. Both companies maintain that the previous year's figures were distorted by the concentration of major sporting events in the period. Campari whets share appetites Campari, whose trademark red, bitter aperitif has long been a favourite of Italians, is now hoping to whet their appetite for its shares, which it plans to float soon on the Italian bourse. The existing shareholders in Davide-Campari-Milano gave their approval for the flotation at a meeting yesterday.",

While the devout Mrs Cotton is not the obvious suspect for the shooting of Phil Mitchell in <strong> EastEnders</strong> (BBC 1), perhaps she heard voices. As we all did. There was enough said at Mel's wedding to inflame a saint. The groom was murderous, the bride tearful and the bridesmaid suicidal. Their footsteps rang hollow in the register office like a bad comic going off stage. </p> <p>However, Mrs Owen, the groom's estranged mother (Sheila Hancock), carrying a load of roses on her head like the muffin man who lives in Drury Lane, and Phil Mitchell, the bride's ex-lover (Steve McFadden), carrying a load of booze, arrived uninvited and got on together like a pub on fire. Of the whole doom-laden wedding party, they seemed to be having much the best time. \"She's long been an inspiration to me\", said Mrs Owen, gazing mistily at a portrait of the Queen in her blue garter. \"The Mother of the Nation\", said Phil, who was just asking for a good slap. \"What a very nice boy you are\", said the groom's mother, much moved. </p> <p>Their happy association continued unabated at the reception. \"What a gentleman you are! One recognises a gentleman by his capacity to distinguish between a great Chablis and a cheap plonk\", she said, darting a basilisk eye at the bride and stubbing out her fag end in the wedding cake. </p> <p>The odd thing is that quite recently she would have been right. The Mitchell brothers were loosely based on the Krays. Grant created charismatic mayhem and Phil swept up after him like a small, industrious dustcart. If not precisely nice, at least nicer. But ever since Grant left, Phil has morphed into the man who makes the mess. As Mel said this week, \"When exactly did you turn into your brother?\" </p> <p> For the benefit of those of you who are looking vacant, Phil enjoyed a Christmas tryst with Mel and ever since has been looking at her longingly, like a bull terrier spotting a tree in Bow. As he is short and fat and she is tall and willowy, their confrontations have to be carefully staged to avoid a tasteless note of comedy. Mel chose, as they will, to marry Steve, who is tall and willowy too. At her wedding Phil took spectacularly to the bottle and put the boot in with some brio. It was now that one felt the lack of a swimming pool. In Dallas, where weddings were conducted on the patio, malcontents were cooled off by being thrown into the bijou pool. I tell you frankly that a flood in the gents, requiring a swift evacuation of the wedding party to the Queen Vic, is not the same thing at all. </p> <p>Phil was running the Queen Vic. So the legendary Curse of the Queen Vic, which puts Tutankhamen firmly in his place, has struck again. Landlords of the Vic are routinely murdered. There was \"Dirty\" Den Watts, shot with a bunch of daffodils as he strolled beside the canal, Eddie Royle, stabbed in Albert Square by, it is widely believed, Nick Cotton, and Grant Mitchell, driven into the Thames by his brother. </p> <p>Phil's last words just before he was shot were tantalisingly \"I know who you are!\" No relation of Bing Crosby being in sight, that leaves us with the usual suspects: Ian, the bride's ex-husband; Steve, the current incumbent; Lisa, Phil's ex-girlfriend; Mark, who loves her hopelessly; and Dan, who appeared from nowhere to make up the numbers. Or you could ask Christopher Reason, who wrote the script. </p> <p>What a shock for Phil's dinky Mum (Barbara Windsor) on her return from Lanzarote! Let us hope the Queen will, as ever, be an inspiration and comfort to her. </p> <p><strong> Ballykissangel</strong> (BBC 1) is back in fine form with Father \"Call me Vincent\" Sheahan (real name, implausibly enough, Robert Taylor), a craggy new Australian priest, who looks as if roughly hewn from a coolabah tree, and a changed but charming cast, not one of whom could walk from a to b in a straight line. And that even before Fitzgerald's opens. The outer habiliments of the late Brian Quigley, the rogue with the brogue, are found folded tidily on the shore, topped by his trilby like a cherry. It's the consensus at Fitzgerald's that he's done a bunk and the arrival of a number of large cheques drawn on the aptly named Banco Sinistre de Rio confirms it. Tony Doyle, who played Quigley, is, in fact, dead but we don't have to believe it if we don't want to.</p>",

There was \"Dirty\" Den Watts, shot with a bunch of daffodils as he strolled beside the canal, Eddie Royle, stabbed in Albert Square by, it is widely believed, Nick Cotton, and Grant Mitchell, driven into the Thames by his brother. Phil's last words just before he was shot were tantalisingly \"I know who you are!\" No relation of Bing Crosby being in sight, that leaves us with the usual suspects: Ian, the bride's ex-husband; Steve, the current incumbent; Lisa, Phil's ex-girlfriend; Mark, who loves her hopelessly; and Dan, who appeared from nowhere to make up the numbers. Or you could ask Christopher Reason, who wrote the script. What a shock for Phil's dinky Mum (Barbara Windsor) on her return from Lanzarote! Let us hope the Queen will, as ever, be an inspiration and comfort to her. Ballykissangel (BBC 1) is back in fine form with Father \"Call me Vincent\" Sheahan (real name, implausibly enough, Robert Taylor), a craggy new Australian priest, who looks as if roughly hewn from a coolabah tree, and a changed but charming cast, not one of whom could walk from a to b in a straight line. And that even before Fitzgerald's opens. The outer habiliments of the late Brian Quigley, the rogue with the brogue, are found folded tidily on the shore, topped by his trilby like a cherry. It's the consensus at Fitzgerald's that he's done a bunk and the arrival of a number of large cheques drawn on the aptly named Banco Sinistre de Rio confirms it. Tony Doyle, who played Quigley, is, in fact, dead but we don't have to believe it if we don't want to.",

But coming from the world's leading financial authority, it hit a raw nerve, especially since the IMF critique echoes that from from European Union finance ministers a couple of weeks ago.</p> <p>Like the EU, the IMF agrees with Mr Brown's strategy, \"particularly the need to enhance public infrastructure and human capital\". Its latest health check on the UK praises the priority placed by Labour on investment and education. It does not call for any spending cuts. This is a far cry from 1976, when the IMF laid down the law to the Labour government led by Jim Callaghan during a sterling crisis, insisting on painful belt-tightening.</p> <p>However, the IMF does not like the way Labour's investment plans should be paid for. The chancellor, who chairs the IMF's policy-making committee, wants to double capital spending to \u00a318bn a year by 2003-04. The chart, based on Institute for Fiscal Studies-Goldman Sachs' \"modest\" assumptions, shows how investment will start to exceed the surplus generated from taxes.</p> <p>Mr Brown believes it is financially sound to borrow in order to invest, as long as the borrowing is kept within strict guidelines preventing the ratio of government debt to GDP rising above 40%. The recent strong performance of the economy combined with the chancellor's tight (some would say over-rigid) control of the public finances means there is no danger of that happening.</p> <p>The IMF on the other hand says public investment should be paid entirely from the revenue raised from taxation. Since current tax receipts are continually overshooting Treasury projections, there is ample scope to fund investment spending without resorting to borrowing. The result would be a balanced budget, a key tenet of the IMF's faith.</p> <p>There are arguments in favour of both sides. The point at issue is quite a narrow one and in any case will have absolutely no bearing on what the Treasury actually does.</p> <p>The IMF's argument is that a higher contribution from the public sector to national saving would boost investment and thereby address the achilles heel of the British economy - poor productivity growth. Although the weakness of productivity growth has many causes, nearly everyone including Mr Brown believes that under-investment is one of them.</p> <p>The chancellor disagrees with the IMF's assessment of who should pay when, believing the Washington-based organisation's hair-shirt approach to public borrowing is old-fashioned and unfair. While he thinks it is right to keep the revenue budget in balance over the economic cycle, he argues that investment on new schools and hospitals falls into a different category from nurses and teachers' pay.</p> <p>Unlike current expenditure, which only benefits those alive at the time, investment benefits both existing and future generations. Those alive in the future should help pay the bill and borrowing, which is in effect deferred taxation, is a way of spreading the cost over time.</p> <p>Carl Emmerson of the IFS sides with Mr Brown. He likens his position to that of an individual buying a house. No one in their right mind would save up the entire costs before purchasing when they can get a mortgage to enjoy the benefit now.</p> <p>However, Mr Emmerson says that neither fiscal norm, the IMF's yen for balance or the chancellor's so called golden rule, is perfect. While both are reasonable rules of thumb to ensure the public finances do not get out of control, they do not necessarily ensure the public gets best value for money from public services.</p> <p>Ultimately it comes down to public - political - choice. Mr Brown's golden rule permitting borrowing for investment is sensible if the benefit to society of that investment is greater than the extra interest costs incurred in borrowing. The Treasury believes there is good reason for believing that this is the case now, when years of under-investment in public services has left them threadbare. With a huge backlog of investment to clear, it is unreasonable to expect the current generation to shoulder all of the costs. We think the IMF is being too fiscally conservative, says the Treasury.</p> <p>On the other hand, it is not always easy to distinguish between current and capital expenditure. Who is to say, for example, whether teachers' pay is one or the other? It is surely both. Moreover, there is nothing sacrosanct about investment spending. As the dome has illustrated, it is perfectly possible to spend millions on public in frastructure and not get value for money.</p> <p>Just ahead of the Budget, the IMF's intervention could not have been more politically awkward but it will make absolutely no difference to the contents of next Wednesday's statement. On top of the \u00a31.7bn already set aside to placate disgruntled motorists, Mr Brown is expected to announce that the health of the public finances means he can introduce targeted tax cuts and spending increases worth just over \u00a32bn without breaching his rules. The IMF would rather he eschewed what it calls \"piecemeal\" tax breaks and pay off debt, but with debt already falling rapidly Mr Brown will no doubt feel fully justified, both economically and politcally, in spreading some extra pre-election cheer.</p> <p>\u0095 Mark Atkinson is the Guardian's economics correspondent.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;mark.atkinson@theguardian.com&quot;\">mark.atkinson@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The recent strong performance of the economy combined with the chancellor's tight (some would say over-rigid) control of the public finances means there is no danger of that happening. The IMF on the other hand says public investment should be paid entirely from the revenue raised from taxation. Since current tax receipts are continually overshooting Treasury projections, there is ample scope to fund investment spending without resorting to borrowing. The result would be a balanced budget, a key tenet of the IMF's faith. There are arguments in favour of both sides. The point at issue is quite a narrow one and in any case will have absolutely no bearing on what the Treasury actually does. The IMF's argument is that a higher contribution from the public sector to national saving would boost investment and thereby address the achilles heel of the British economy - poor productivity growth. Although the weakness of productivity growth has many causes, nearly everyone including Mr Brown believes that under-investment is one of them. The chancellor disagrees with the IMF's assessment of who should pay when, believing the Washington-based organisation's hair-shirt approach to public borrowing is old-fashioned and unfair. While he thinks it is right to keep the revenue budget in balance over the economic cycle, he argues that investment on new schools and hospitals falls into a different category from nurses and teachers' pay. Unlike current expenditure, which only benefits those alive at the time, investment benefits both existing and future generations. Those alive in the future should help pay the bill and borrowing, which is in effect deferred taxation, is a way of spreading the cost over time. Carl Emmerson of the IFS sides with Mr Brown. He likens his position to that of an individual buying a house. No one in their right mind would save up the entire costs before purchasing when they can get a mortgage to enjoy the benefit now. However, Mr Emmerson says that neither fiscal norm, the IMF's yen for balance or the chancellor's so called golden rule, is perfect. While both are reasonable rules of thumb to ensure the public finances do not get out of control, they do not necessarily ensure the public gets best value for money from public services. Ultimately it comes down to public - political - choice. Mr Brown's golden rule permitting borrowing for investment is sensible if the benefit to society of that investment is greater than the extra interest costs incurred in borrowing. The Treasury believes there is good reason for believing that this is the case now, when years of under-investment in public services has left them threadbare. With a huge backlog of investment to clear, it is unreasonable to expect the current generation to shoulder all of the costs. We think the IMF is being too fiscally conservative, says the Treasury. On the other hand, it is not always easy to distinguish between current and capital expenditure. Who is to say, for example, whether teachers' pay is one or the other? It is surely both. Moreover, there is nothing sacrosanct about investment spending. As the dome has illustrated, it is perfectly possible to spend millions on public in frastructure and not get value for money. Just ahead of the Budget, the IMF's intervention could not have been more politically awkward but it will make absolutely no difference to the contents of next Wednesday's statement. On top of the \u00a31.7bn already set aside to placate disgruntled motorists, Mr Brown is expected to announce that the health of the public finances means he can introduce targeted tax cuts and spending increases worth just over \u00a32bn without breaching his rules. The IMF would rather he eschewed what it calls \"piecemeal\" tax breaks and pay off debt, but with debt already falling rapidly Mr Brown will no doubt feel fully justified, both economically and politcally, in spreading some extra pre-election cheer. \u0095 Mark Atkinson is the Guardian's economics correspondent. mark.atkinson@theguardian.com",

But unlike his father's films, there's not much else to enjoy beyond the sheer elan: the chaotic plot has Robert Carlyle's lowly Plunkett teaming up with Jonny Lee Miller's gentlemanly Macleane to steal from the rich - and keep it. Liv Tyler is underemployed as Macleane's wench and Ken Stott is a pantomime baddy. </p> <p><strong> Out Of Sight</strong> (Steven Soderbergh, 1998) <br>10pm, Sky Premier</p> <p> This hip and witty thriller brought indie star Soderbergh storming into the mainstream.

But unlike his father's films, there's not much else to enjoy beyond the sheer elan: the chaotic plot has Robert Carlyle's lowly Plunkett teaming up with Jonny Lee Miller's gentlemanly Macleane to steal from the rich - and keep it. Liv Tyler is underemployed as Macleane's wench and Ken Stott is a pantomime baddy. Out Of Sight (Steven Soderbergh, 1998) 10pm, Sky Premier This hip and witty thriller brought indie star Soderbergh storming into the mainstream.

Do I return to where my family is so I can get reliable support for me and my son, or do I stick it out here, where I have few friends, so my son and his father can have regular contact? \u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday.

As chief inspector of schools, he was required to report fairly on progress as well as reverses behind the school gate. This he dutifully did in his annual reports, but was far from dismayed when the media concentrated on the bad bits. The other Chris Woodhead revelled in his media role as the teachers' bogeyman. From yesterday, the first Chris Woodhead exited right stage. Released from his contractual requirement to remain silent about Ofsted for the first three months, following his resignation last November, the second Chris Woodhead emerged yesterday full of undiluted bile and bitterness towards ministers and teachers in his new role as a Daily Telegraph columnist and leader writer. So which Chris Woodhead should be believed?

The furthest away survivor she had located was a jazz musician in Paris called Hal Singer, who was a baby at the time.</p> <p>The Oklahoma representative Don Ross, whose bill in the state legislature set up the inquiry and who has been the most active figure in seeking recompense, said that he still believes that repar- ations should be paid.

Eddiefaye Gates, the chairwoman of the survivors' committee and a member of the commission, said yesterday that resistance to the idea of compensation was unsurprising. \"There is something about this whole nation when it comes to black people,\" said Ms Gates. \"We did it for the native Americans whose land had been taken, we did it for the Japanese Americans who were interned during the war and had their property taken but when it comes to black people, we don't do it.\" Plans for the memorial have already been approved but Ms Gates said that legislators were obliged to do this because a memorial has already been completed for the victims of the much more recent Oklahoma City bombing. Ms Gates, whose committee has tracked down 121 survivors so far, said that she was still finding more all over the US. The furthest away survivor she had located was a jazz musician in Paris called Hal Singer, who was a baby at the time. The Oklahoma representative Don Ross, whose bill in the state legislature set up the inquiry and who has been the most active figure in seeking recompense, said that he still believes that repar- ations should be paid. Mr Ross wants public recognition of what had happened: \"We were taught nothing about it as children. It wasn't until I was in high school that I heard about it.\"",

      "bodyText": "More than one patient in every 10 admitted to hospital for treatment will suffer some sort of harm while they are there, according to the first study of its kind in the UK. The toll of what are known as \"adverse events\", ranging from picking up a minor infection on the ward to the recent tragedies when patients have died through drugs being injected in the wrong part of the body, costs the NHS around \u00a31bn a yearin extra treatment, says the study, published today in the British Medical Journal. That is besides the high cost of litigation - \u00a377m compensation was paid to patients last year - and the human cost in suffering for patients and their relatives. Although there have been studies in the US and Australia to establish how many patients suffer unexpected harm in hospital, the exercise by Charles Vincent, professor of psychology, and colleagues in the clinical risk unit of University College London has never been undertaken before in the UK. They found that the rate of adverse events in their pilot study of 1,014 patients in two London hospitals was 10.8%. Since some patients suffered more than one event, the percentage of medical misadventures was still higher, at 11.7%. This is considerably higher than the 3.7% recorded by a Harvard study in the US, but lower than the Australian figure of 16.6%. The team found that half the adverse events in the UK were preventable. \"I strongly suspected there was a problem of this magnitude,\" said Professor Vincent. \"I don't think we have faced up to the scale of it or the economic consequences of it.\" Prof Vincent was a member of the panel put together by the chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, which last year launched a blueprint for the NHS to report mistakes and learn from them. The document, An Organisation With a Memory, promised confidential phone lines for medical staff to report mistakes anonymously and central databases which would reveal common and preventable mistakes. But little appears to have happened so far, and without precise data for the rates and numbers of mistakes being made by doctors and nurses, it will be impossible to tell whether the confidential reporting system is aware of more than the tip of the iceberg. \"Reporting is not going to tell you what is going on where, and how much it is costing,\" Prof Vincent said. He and his team want to carry out a large-scale study to provide a picture of the rate and cost of adverse events nationwide. In an editorial in the BMJ, Sir George Alberti, president of the Royal College of Physicians, concurs. \"Only a full-scale study can substantiate this estimate, and if the NHS is serious about learning about and reducing errors it should fund such a study,\" he writes. But Prof Vincent has tried without success to get financial backing for the work, which raises questions as to how eager the NHS is to know the truth about medical error. The mistakes that are made in hospital were \"much more often an accumulation of small things rather than one big blunder, such as problems in record-keeping and delays\", he said.

In his editorial, Sir George points out that there are things that can be done to prevent errors happening, once it is clear what is going on. Better surgical training is needed. \"Fewer operations and procedures during the night may also help,\" he says. Drugs errors remain a problem, but Birmingham has a computer linked pharmacology system, which sends out warnings when drugs that could be dangerous in combination are prescribed. \"The introduction of such a system nationwide could prevent hundreds, indeed thousands, of errors,\" he writes. There may be more mistakes made by doctors than even this study suggests, Sir George says, because not every error leads to harm to the patient. \"A pilot study by the Royal College of Physicians into deaths after admission for medical emergencies suggests that some error occurred in as many as one in five cases..

The last time he dug this deeply into his back catalogue he came up with the dreadful Godfather 3, a movie erected as mere scaffolding for a global marketing campaign. Godfather 3 blighted the memory of its two predecessors, which, taken together, represent Coppola's greatest achievement and one of the greatest American films since the second world war. Coppola later admitted that the three-quel paid his back taxes, and that admission - as well as the film itself - proved what had long been suspected: the Emperor of Zoetrope had no clothes and was clad only in the ashes of his former glory. </p> <p>By releasing an expanded Apocalypse Now, Coppola is turning the clock back to 1979, the last time he could seriously be called an outstanding American film-maker. The past 20 years have been hard on those of us who once expected of him a great and distinguished career. Instead, we have realised that two Godfathers, one Conversation, bits of The Rain People and about two-thirds of Apocalypse were all he really had in him. There have been blips in his decline: parts of Rumble Fish, One from the Heart and even The Cotton Club are marvellous, but have we any serious takers for Jack, Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Rainmaker, or Life Without Zoe - his toe-curling contribution to New York Stories? </p> <p>The impression one gets from collaborators and biographers is that Coppola was creatively bankrupted by Apocalypse Now's five-year production schedule, which included a harrowing 238-day shoot in Marcos's Philippines and 18 months in the editing suite. Accounts of the shoot refer to monsoons destroying whole sets, adultery, a prodigious collective intake of posh Hollywood narcotics, stars having heart attacks, and a director becoming increasingly messianic. Co-screenwriter John Milius, a self-described \"right-wing anarchist\" fond of martial metaphors, says that \"All the veterans on Apocalypse Now look back on it exactly as veterans look back on the war\". Strange - I don't recall GIs at the siege of Khe Sahn asking for fresh lobsters and caviar to be airlifted to them. </p> <p>So why now? And why not five years ago, when a micro-magazine named Film Threat, which I worked for at the time, got hold of a version fully two hours longer than the forthcoming \"expanded cut\"? FT detailed its contents in an extensive article in April 1996, and called upon Coppola to release a version containing this extra footage, which he had once told Rolling Stone didn't exist. We put it on the cover, with hints of what it contained: \"The five-hour version you must see! See Sheen stabbing children! Hopper's death scene! Brando blabbing!\" </p> <p>We'd been given an nth-generation video dub of an assembly print that included almost all the workably coherent material. About seven more Doors songs appeared on the rudimentary soundtrack, which still lacked Michael Herr's narration (we all agreed we didn't miss it). The Playboy bunnies sequence was much longer: the bunny-copter has run out of fuel, but Sheen offers them some from his boat if his crew can boff the bunnies. There's an interlude at a French rubber plantation (which has been restored to the \"expanded\" version), and a sexual encounter between the lady of the house and Martin Sheen's stone-hearted Willard. Dennis Hopper's blitzed photo-journalist is murdered by Scott Glenn (who's only in two shots of the '79 cut), and Glenn is almost immediately killed by Sheen. Willard is altogether more psychopathic. On the way to execute Brando's Kurtz, he stabs three more people to death, including a father and child whom he skewers on the same spear. Sheen also shows flashes of humour, including a JFK impersonation he uses to soften up Duvall's more human Kilgore. </p> <p>Among the less welcome additions are endless shots of helicopters and a bloated, more Charles Manson-like Brando reading the New York Times to the captive Willard. The cut also lacked certain scenes, marked with \"scene missing\" title cards, so it's possible to imagine a version lasting up to six hours. </p> <p>Film Threat didn't say where the rough-cut had come from (\"We found it. In our office. Over behind that chair,\" was what we printed); but when we called Coppola's office to hassle him about releasing an expanded cut, his people pinpointed our source in one guess. The Zoetrope lawyers were on the phone pronto, demanding the return of the tape and all dubs and generally crying blue murder. That's the last anyone heard about the matter until Coppola's announcement this week. </p> <p>I've come to think that Apocalypse Now is a film you finally grow out of. As Coppola said in 1979: \"It's less of a movie and more of an experience.\" It's a theme-park movie, each bravura sequence a different thrill-ride, the parts greater than the whole, the ending almost wilfully incoherent and unintegrated. The borrowings from Werner Herzog's Aguirre: Wrath of God (just as spectacular and more intellectually rigorous - on a budget of $300,000) are innumerable. The final sequence, in which Willard sacrifices Kurtz, is almost a shot-for-shot remake of The Host, a film-school graduation short by Coppola's UCLA classmate, Corman B-director Jack Hill. </p> <p>A few years ago, Hill told me that The Host's cameraman was on the crew of Apocalypse when Coppola crowed about his new ending: \"We're remaking Jack Hill's graduation movie!\" The affable Hill said he didn't mind a bit, though he would have liked some acknowledgment.

      "body": "<p>This is a gooey, sticky, mushy, sickly-sweet confection of a movie; it tastes much more like the dairy milk chocolate proffered to the uneducated Gump-ish palates of Britain and America than the dark, bitter substance preferred by the discerning French. Watching this very self-conscious comedy-romance is a bit like being forced to eat a Thornton's factory out of business. </p> <p>Chocolat is directed by Lasse Hallstrom, the man who in The Cider House Rules took the themes of racial prejudice and sexual abuse and suffused them in a weirdly benign glow. Hallstrom turns the feelgood bestseller by British author Joanne Harris into what looks like a two-hour version of one of those TV ads targeted patronisingly at the female consumer, coyly suggesting that chocolate is the new sex, or maybe that sex is the new chocolate. It certainly suggests that filling your face with chocolate is a richly joyous, warmly sensual, life-affirming and above all giving experience - and in itself a devastating rebuke to the tyrannies of the Roman Catholic church. </p> <p>It's got a strong cast doing their best. Only a churl would not feel his heart lift at the sight of the star, Juliette Binoche. Her grace, beauty and intelligence are subjects on which I have descanted in the past, and to which I shall return when Michael Haneke's Code Unknown is released later this year. But here she is let down by having to play the ineffably smug part of Vianne, a free-spirited woman who turns up in an uptight French town in the late 1950s. It is here that a Clochemerlesque comedy unfolds. </p> <p>Accompanied by her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), Binoche opens up a chocolaterie - presumably drawing upon a substantial reserve of capital - and mischievously yet adorably unlocks the sensuality of the townsfolk. This she does with her strangely saucy creations. She is aided and abetted by her elderly landlady Armande, played with vigour and poise by Judi Dench. </p> <p>Unhappily, however, Binoche's heroine has chosen the beginning of Lent for this adventure and, worse, proposes a (preposterous) \"chocolate festival\" to coincide with Easter Sunday. The cut of her jib offends the Comte de Reynaud, aristocratic mayor and pillar of the church, a right old misery-guts who sets out to ruin her. This role is gamely played by the superb Alfred Molina, all tightly buttoned discomfiture and sweaty, pop-eyed self-denial, displaced into ill-humoured disapproval of anyone else enjoying themselves. </p> <p>Molina is a heavyweight performer who can pack a real punch. But only a fraction of his power is uncoiled the way it was in such parts as Kenneth Halliwell and John Ogden. And this is because of the way that Hallstrom emphasises the movie's whole naughty-but-nice ethos. Molina is supposed to be an unpleasant bigot, and when we fleetingly see Africans delivering the raw material for Binoche's shop, a racial dimension to the comte's loathing of the chocolaterie is, perhaps, subliminally suggested. </p> <p>Furthermore, he refers in passing to his forebears having booted out the Huguenots. But Hallstrom presents us with an oddly flavourless, odourless, unhistorical sort of bigotry. The obvious subject, anti-semitism, is absent, and Molina has a line making it clear that he sincerely disapproved of collaborators during the war - hardly a convincing side for a reactionary Catholic toff to take, I suggest. No, the comte is obviously ripe for eventual redemption since, like everything in this film, he has a soft centre. </p> <p>Bigotry is what brings us to the most groan-inducingly awful part of the film: Johnny Depp, playing a hunky riverboat traveller called Roux with a hunky ponytail and hunky facial hair. He is one of the Gypsies loathed by the comte. Roux is not on the screen for long, but it's quite long enough. Despite his character's name, Mr Depp has evidently decided that he is not comfortable with the 'Allo 'Allo Franglais voices imposed on everyone else, so he plays him as an Irishman with what is supposed to be an Irish accent. For this he ought to be shot at dawn, or preferably earlier. It's similar to the Gypsy he played in Sally Potter's The Man Who Cried, only much, much more embarrassing. </p> <p>He's always to be found a-hummin' and a-strummin' on his guitar, a fascinating lone-wolf figure. Needless to say, Roux is the kindred spirit with whom Juliette elects to get it on for a rare bit of non-chocolate-oriented, off-camera loving. Then he is off, footloose force of nature that he is, taking with him our sincere good wishes and a heartfelt request that Mr Depp give the free-spirit Romany roles a miss from now on. </p> <p>The sheer, unmitigated ickiness of the film is what gets you down in the end. That and the supercilious association of chocolate with sex. It's got all the taste and style of \"erotic\" chocolate body-paint kits on sale at British Home Stores.</p>",

Mtukudzi, who later indulged in his own spot of dancing, to the delight of the audience, was like the Pied Piper - mesmerising, charismatic, the leader of the gang.",

      "body": "<p>Big bosses' pay is back on the agenda, with new guidelines yesterday from the Association of British Insurers demanding that executive share incentive schemes show a clear link to performance. </p> <p>At the same time the ABI, which speaks for institutions managing over \u00a31,000bn in total, has endorsed the growing trend towards phased annual grants of options or shares, which it believes do motivate executives to improve shareholder returns. </p> <p>This potentially opens the door to much higher pay deals for Britain's corporate ruling class. </p> <p>Expect to see more of the packages enjoyed by people such as Matt Barrett at Barclays and Martin Sorrell at WPP, where exceptional share price performance promises spectacular \"compensation\" packages. </p> <p>The ABI has also made it clear that its new guidelines will only permit companies to adopt American-style pay deals - where options simply replace cash and are not performance driven - in the most exceptional of circumstances. </p> <p>Firms would have to prove they were under true global pressure and unable to hire a particular executive to dodge the rules. </p> <p>The ABI has avoided setting any sort of upper limit on pay, but says it only wants top money for top people, with sliding scales of performance always linked to the relative performance of peer companies. Bad managers should get nothing, it says. </p> <p>This would all appear to be quite sensible and grown-up. But maintaining the fight against vulgar pay packets for shoddy corporate leadership will require the ABI to demonstrate clearly that it has little time for abuses of its code. </p> <p>Understanding the pay deals being offered will be the first step. </p> <p>There is a need to root out attempts to hide big packages behind legal jargon. Shareholders should be able to see the potential total and how it might be earned. </p> <p>Meanwhile, 18 months of silence has passed since Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, promised to get tough on boardroom excesses. </p> <p>Since he has clearly been struggling to find something to say on the issue, perhaps he should start by backing the ABI's message. </p> <p><strong>Bandit territory</strong><br> </p> <p>The public, supported by the press, has long demanded that the financial services industry is stringently regulated. The pressure for clean money has been such that the City is now far and away the most closely monitored financial centre in Europe. </p> <p>We have umpteen thousand bureaucrats sitting in the financial services authority at Canary Wharf. Every financial firm has a compliance officer to make sure rules are adhered to. Just about every telephone call made in the Square Mile is recorded. Anyone and everyone can be interviewed at a moment's notice by the financial police, without any proper right to silence, under the threat of jail and/or an unlimited fine. </p> <p>It is positively Orwellian, and it also costs a fortune. So those in the financial industry must be faintly bemused by the response of the newspaper industry to secondary legislation now proposed by the Treasury which would make it mandatory for any journalist tipping a share or other investment to declare any interest, such as owning the share being tipped. </p> <p>\"Completely unworkable,\" bellowed Les Hinton, chairman of the newspaper industry's code of practice committee and executive chairman of News International. \"Think again,\" instructed a Times leader column. </p> <p>There are two main threads to the newspaper industry's response. One is that state regulation of the press of any kind is a no-no in peacetime. The other is that the proposed legislation does not take into account the complexities of newspaper production. Several people can be involved in a decision to tip a particular share and a tipsters' column will typically pass through several hands before reaching the printers.

      "bodyText": "Big bosses' pay is back on the agenda, with new guidelines yesterday from the Association of British Insurers demanding that executive share incentive schemes show a clear link to performance. At the same time the ABI, which speaks for institutions managing over \u00a31,000bn in total, has endorsed the growing trend towards phased annual grants of options or shares, which it believes do motivate executives to improve shareholder returns. This potentially opens the door to much higher pay deals for Britain's corporate ruling class. Expect to see more of the packages enjoyed by people such as Matt Barrett at Barclays and Martin Sorrell at WPP, where exceptional share price performance promises spectacular \"compensation\" packages. The ABI has also made it clear that its new guidelines will only permit companies to adopt American-style pay deals - where options simply replace cash and are not performance driven - in the most exceptional of circumstances. Firms would have to prove they were under true global pressure and unable to hire a particular executive to dodge the rules. The ABI has avoided setting any sort of upper limit on pay, but says it only wants top money for top people, with sliding scales of performance always linked to the relative performance of peer companies. Bad managers should get nothing, it says. This would all appear to be quite sensible and grown-up. But maintaining the fight against vulgar pay packets for shoddy corporate leadership will require the ABI to demonstrate clearly that it has little time for abuses of its code. Understanding the pay deals being offered will be the first step. There is a need to root out attempts to hide big packages behind legal jargon. Shareholders should be able to see the potential total and how it might be earned. Meanwhile, 18 months of silence has passed since Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, promised to get tough on boardroom excesses. Since he has clearly been struggling to find something to say on the issue, perhaps he should start by backing the ABI's message. Bandit territory The public, supported by the press, has long demanded that the financial services industry is stringently regulated. The pressure for clean money has been such that the City is now far and away the most closely monitored financial centre in Europe. We have umpteen thousand bureaucrats sitting in the financial services authority at Canary Wharf. Every financial firm has a compliance officer to make sure rules are adhered to. Just about every telephone call made in the Square Mile is recorded. Anyone and everyone can be interviewed at a moment's notice by the financial police, without any proper right to silence, under the threat of jail and/or an unlimited fine. It is positively Orwellian, and it also costs a fortune. So those in the financial industry must be faintly bemused by the response of the newspaper industry to secondary legislation now proposed by the Treasury which would make it mandatory for any journalist tipping a share or other investment to declare any interest, such as owning the share being tipped. \"Completely unworkable,\" bellowed Les Hinton, chairman of the newspaper industry's code of practice committee and executive chairman of News International. \"Think again,\" instructed a Times leader column. There are two main threads to the newspaper industry's response. One is that state regulation of the press of any kind is a no-no in peacetime. The other is that the proposed legislation does not take into account the complexities of newspaper production. Several people can be involved in a decision to tip a particular share and a tipsters' column will typically pass through several hands before reaching the printers. Where, it is asked, might the declarations of interest begin and end? These are fair objections. But in marshalling its response the newspaper industry should remember that its City desks are quite lucky to be excluded from the regulatory dragnet which makes a misery of life in the City proper. If calls to this office were recorded, there would be a lot of blank space in these pages. At the same time, it should also be noted that the Treasury and the FSA are not really gunning for the national press. The real problem lies with bandit tip sheets and alleged investment web-sites which claim journalistic privilege, but which are not tied to the industry code of practice. They have little need to maintain high professional standards. In fact, the issue here is not about making sure readers as customers are fully informed.

To do it justice, the work needs a fairly lavish staging, complete with sizable chorus and decent choreography, so that at least the set pieces can go with a bit of a sparkle; otherwise an evening among all those wretched people - there are few operas with a less endearing line-up of characters - can seem a very long time indeed. Musically, it needs stylish performances by a top-notch cast and efficient orchestra, while sopranos who can successfully tackle the title role don't grow on trees. </p> <p>It is good to report that ETO's new production by Gordon Anderson confounds at least some of those prejudices. A cast of just 18 singers (only Manon and Des Grieux are excused duty in the chorus line) work tremendously hard to bring this sprawling, infuriating piece to life. The contrast between public glitter and private amorality is certainly made; and they even manage a little bit of a dance routine for Manon's third-act gavotte. Jamie Vartan's birdcage set may be a slightly weary metaphor, but is adaptable enough to suggest the railway station at Amiens, Des Grieux's Paris apartment, a fairground by the Seine and the church of St Sulpice, though it can't cope with the final act on the road to Le Havre, which has to be played out before a plain cloth. </p> <p>Within these parameters Anderson doesn't do much other than get everyone on and off the stage efficiently, but then ETO's brief isn't to take deconstructed opera around the country, just simple, practical shows, sung in English. It certainly provides an effective showcase for Kate Ladner's Manon, who shows she has the vocal agility and the top notes for the role, and makes a good stab at pinning down the ambiguity of the character, who is not so much a tragic heroine, more a pain in the arse. The rest of the cast is workmanlike rather than notable: Des Grieux is Andrew Burden, reportedly suffering from a cold on the first night; De Bretigny, Benjamin Bland; Lescaut, Howard Quilla Croft. The conductor Andrew Greenwood understands how the score goes, and should get better results from the orchestra when they know it properly; there is a long tour in prospect. </p> <p>\u0095 Further performance tonight.

A cast of just 18 singers (only Manon and Des Grieux are excused duty in the chorus line) work tremendously hard to bring this sprawling, infuriating piece to life. The contrast between public glitter and private amorality is certainly made; and they even manage a little bit of a dance routine for Manon's third-act gavotte. Jamie Vartan's birdcage set may be a slightly weary metaphor, but is adaptable enough to suggest the railway station at Amiens, Des Grieux's Paris apartment, a fairground by the Seine and the church of St Sulpice, though it can't cope with the final act on the road to Le Havre, which has to be played out before a plain cloth. Within these parameters Anderson doesn't do much other than get everyone on and off the stage efficiently, but then ETO's brief isn't to take deconstructed opera around the country, just simple, practical shows, sung in English. It certainly provides an effective showcase for Kate Ladner's Manon, who shows she has the vocal agility and the top notes for the role, and makes a good stab at pinning down the ambiguity of the character, who is not so much a tragic heroine, more a pain in the arse. The rest of the cast is workmanlike rather than notable: Des Grieux is Andrew Burden, reportedly suffering from a cold on the first night; De Bretigny, Benjamin Bland; Lescaut, Howard Quilla Croft. The conductor Andrew Greenwood understands how the score goes, and should get better results from the orchestra when they know it properly; there is a long tour in prospect. \u0095 Further performance tonight. Box office: 01223 503333. Then touring to Reading, Brighton, Poole and around Britain until June 1.",
