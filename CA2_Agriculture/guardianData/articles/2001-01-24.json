Danilevicius has played three games as a substitute for Arsenal since joining in December. </p> <p>Tottenham have admitted an interest in Southampton's Morocco striker Hassan Kachloul, who is stalling over a new contract at the Dell. </p> <p>Newcastle's goalkeeper Shay Given has withdrawn his transfer request, and Aston Villa's goalkeeper David James has agreed a new 3-year contract, 12 months longer than his current deal. </p> <p>James's agent Colin Gordon said: \"We shook hands on the deal last night. There are a few more technicalities to be tied up but nothing that will stop it going through. </p> <p>\"He has been very impressed with Juan Pablo Angel since he arrived and feels he can achieve the things he wants to in the game with Villa.\" Villa announced a loss before tax of \u00a32.6m for the six months up to November 30 last year. </p> <p>The Leeds manager David O'Leary has said that Rio Ferdinand's chances of playing in the Premiership game at Villa tonight are not as remote as first thought.

Fifa and Uefa last night finalised joint proposals calling for players to honour contracts for a minimum of three years and for a compensation system that would value players according to their commercial worth to a club as well as time spent on training, level of salary and other input into a player's development. Chelsea are keen to take the 22-year-old defender Philippe Christanval from Monaco as part of the deal that would see Frank Leboeuf return to his homeland, according to reports in France. Chelsea have said Leboeuf can leave if Monaco meet their asking price, believed to be \u00a33m, and Leboeuf has confirmed that his career at Stamford Bridge is over. \"I do not have a future here and it is time to move on,\" he said. \"I want to go to Monaco and I hope a deal can be made between the two clubs. I do not want to stay at Chelsea if I'm not playing. I think I might have played my last game for the club.\" Arsenal should escape expulsion from the FA Cup or losing Premier League points even if their Lithuanian striker Tomas Danilevicius is expelled from Britain for allegedly carrying a false passport. A Football Association spokesman said that Arsenal could only be punished if it was proven they knew Danilevicius had entered the country on a false Greek passport after signing from FC Lausanne of Switzerland for an undisclosed fee. \"But at the moment it's all hypothetical,\" he said. Danilevicius has played three games as a substitute for Arsenal since joining in December. Tottenham have admitted an interest in Southampton's Morocco striker Hassan Kachloul, who is stalling over a new contract at the Dell. Newcastle's goalkeeper Shay Given has withdrawn his transfer request, and Aston Villa's goalkeeper David James has agreed a new 3-year contract, 12 months longer than his current deal. James's agent Colin Gordon said: \"We shook hands on the deal last night. There are a few more technicalities to be tied up but nothing that will stop it going through. \"He has been very impressed with Juan Pablo Angel since he arrived and feels he can achieve the things he wants to in the game with Villa.\" Villa announced a loss before tax of \u00a32.6m for the six months up to November 30 last year. The Leeds manager David O'Leary has said that Rio Ferdinand's chances of playing in the Premiership game at Villa tonight are not as remote as first thought. Ferdinand looked likely to miss the game after straining tendons behind his knee while watching television. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Barnes was recruited by his former Liverpool and Newcastle manager in the summer of 1999, having just retired as a player, and soon began making signings, among them the midfielder Eyal Berkovic for \u00a35.75m and the defender Rafael Scheidt for \u00a35m. \"It was John who signed all the players at Celtic,\" Dalglish said. \"I don't know who was the worst although there were more bad ones than good ones. \"Obviously there was some consultation between us, but the guy who is responsible for who plays, how we played, and where and when we trained is the guy who is ultimately responsible for buying players.\" Dalglish also confirmed that a row between the head coach and Mark Viduka during the 3-1 cup defeat by Inverness Caley had effectively ended Barnes's reign. He was sacked two days later, only eight months into a three-year deal. Dalglish took control of team affairs but was sacked after O'Neill was appointed as manager last summer. Dalglish later obtained a Court of Session judgment against the club for \u00a3612,522 plus interest. Fulham have taken Peter Moller Nielsen on loan from Real Oviedo for the rest of the season. The 28-year-old striker was a member of Denmark's 1998 World Cup squad. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

But according to the curator of the Manchester City museum, Phil Noble, Defoe now shares the post war record with former City striker Billy McAdams who scored 10 in 10 during the 1957-58 season. </p> <p>A statement on the Manchester City website claims that this will \"throw a spanner in the works\" of many journalists who have rushed to praise Defoe this week, and the website also notes: \"Billy McAdams was of course knocking them in for the Blues in Division 1. Young Jermaine Defoe has achieved his run in Division 2 ( the old Division 3)!\"</p> <p>Noble was tipped off about the anomaly by his dad Peter. Peter, another die-hard Blue, told Football Unlimited today: \"I was there when Billy Mac scored his tenth goal. We beat Everton 6-2 and it was absolutely chucking it down. Kevin Harper also scored a hat-trick of penalties, which I think is some kind of record.\"</p> <p>After the tip from his dad, Phil went on to check the City record books and confirm that McAdams netted 10 in a row. Asked whether he felt sorry about depriving Defoe of his moment of glory, Noble senior said: \"Not at all.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Despite lots of headlines to the contrary, it appears that Bournemouth's teenage striker Jermaine Defoe is yet to break the post-war league record for scoring goals in consecutive matches. The 19-year-old, on loan from West Ham, scored his 10th goal in 10 games last night, scoring the first in a 2-0 win for the Cherries over Cambridge. But according to the curator of the Manchester City museum, Phil Noble, Defoe now shares the post war record with former City striker Billy McAdams who scored 10 in 10 during the 1957-58 season. A statement on the Manchester City website claims that this will \"throw a spanner in the works\" of many journalists who have rushed to praise Defoe this week, and the website also notes: \"Billy McAdams was of course knocking them in for the Blues in Division 1. Young Jermaine Defoe has achieved his run in Division 2 ( the old Division 3)!\" Noble was tipped off about the anomaly by his dad Peter. Peter, another die-hard Blue, told Football Unlimited today: \"I was there when Billy Mac scored his tenth goal. We beat Everton 6-2 and it was absolutely chucking it down. Kevin Harper also scored a hat-trick of penalties, which I think is some kind of record.\" After the tip from his dad, Phil went on to check the City record books and confirm that McAdams netted 10 in a row. Asked whether he felt sorry about depriving Defoe of his moment of glory, Noble senior said: \"Not at all.\"",

How far is this government really thinking about significant change in the economic and social structures of British society - or of the wider world? What are the key challenges it will face? These are the questions to be explored at the Fabian Society's day-long conference \"Transforming Britain: Prospects for a Second Term\" on Saturday 27 January at the LSE in London.</p> <p>The Fabian Society's new year conference has become something of a fixture in the political calendar in recent years. More than 600 people have attended the last two events - in 1999 on globalisation, and last year on the history (and future) of the Labour party on its centenary. We are expecting more this time. There is always a good atmosphere - serious argument on important issues, open and often passionate disagreement, but never factional conflict and always a lot of fun. What marks them out is the direct engagement of ordinary members of the public - people interested in politics, some of them activists in various organisations, others just committed to the pursuit of ideas - with ministers, MPs, respected academics and leading journalists. It is a unique forum in many ways, with so many leading figures in public life addressing, being challenged by, and rubbing shoulders with, the people who really matter.</p> <p>This year we have Gordon Brown, David Blunkett, Polly Toynbee, Germaine Greer, Tony Giddens, Jeremy Vine, Peter Hain, Hugo Young, Jude Kelly, Charles Secrett, Pam Giddy and many others - in fact more than 40 speakers in all, including a dozen ministers.</p> <p>The subject they are discussing - how Labour might go about transforming Britain in a second term - has been the Fabian Society's focus pretty much since the government took office. It was always clear that the first term would be about foundation building, and our role is to look beyond the present. At the end of last year we launched our major report on the future of taxation and public services (Paying for Progress: A New Politics of Tax for Public Spending) - probably the key issue on which the electorate will decide at this election. We have produced a series of short pamphlets on specific policy reforms for a second term - paid parental leave, capital grants for young people, reform of private schools, for example. Many of our publications take on the big challenges of a changing world - globalisation (we have just published a stimulating new pamphlet on its impacts on foreign policy by Peter Hain), the future of democracy in a consumer age, the urgent task of environmental reconstruction.</p> <p>The point about our publications and events is that they are not just for an elite at Westminster. We believe that politics and political ideas must grow out of a participative culture. The Fabian Society is Britain's only democratically constituted think tank, one you can actually join. We have around 6,000 members and more than 70 local groups around the country, as well as a thriving Young Fabian section.

As no-one is safe in Bandit Country - ie: Essex - the Fiver Missing Persons Bureau quickly organised the biggest manhunt since the Fiver With No Name returned the Texas Seven to the slammer.</p> <p>First we paid a visit to Gary Tatchell, who saw a Mercedes leased to Charles crash into a Ford Sierra on Monday night. According to Tatchell, the Sierra driver's request for insurance details was met with a twitter of \"Just have the car! Just have the car!\" from the Mercedes driver. When Sierra man replied, \"I don't want the car, mate. I just want the insurance details!\", the Mercedes driver jumped back into the car and shot off. Mighty strange behaviour which was duly noted it in our Missing Persons Bureau wipe-clean scribble pad.</p> <p>Police later found the abandoned Merc with half a bottle of whisky on the front seat, and when Charles didn't show at West Ham's training ground at Chadwell Heath this morning, we knew it was time to act. So we bought some go-faster stripes and attached them to our rusting Ford Cortina. Before long, the old beauty was being smoked along the wild roads of the M25. But we had barely hit Romford when we heard Charles's solicitor announce that the player had contacted the police and is due to be questioned by officers investigating the crash. That's good news for Charles, good news for the Sierra driver - and we're pretty pleased with our Cortina as well.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NOBLE PRIZE WINNERS</strong></p> <p>It had been a good week for Jermaine Defoe. West Ham's teenage striker, on loan at Bournemouth, had had lots of nice press people coming round and asking him about his goalscoring feats, which had left him on the verge of the post-war goalscoring record in consecutive matches. Jermaine took it all in his stride, got nice compliments from his colleagues, and then went and scored his 10th goal in 10 games last night against Cambridge. He collapsed to his knees in celebration and savoured his \"wonderful moment\". Then some Manchester City fan had to go and take it away from him.</p> <p>Or, to be precise, the curator of the MCFC museum (MC stands for \"Massive Club\"). A statement on City's website this morning revealed, with no small amount of glee, that \"City have put a spanner in the works of a record breaking scoring run\". Apparently, while \"the scribes were eulogizing on their lap tops\" about Defoe's strike, curator Phil Noble was verifying that Billy McAdams had done exactly the same thing for City in 1957-58. Or, alternatively, checking with his dad.</p> <p>\"I was there when he did it,\" Pete Noble told the Fiver when we rang his son's home this afternoon (Phil was at work, obviously chronicling City's recent glories isn't a full-time job). \"We didn't know it was the final match. They beat Everton 6-2 in the pissing rain. Ken Barnes got a hat-trick of penalties. The Sun have already been onto us, of course.\" Of course. But after breaking little Jermaine's heart like that, doesn't he feel a little bit sorry for him? \"Not at all. As far as we're concerned, it's Billy Mac's record.\" The Noble family, City through and through.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"It could be a benefit for him, I suppose, as he will be able to see Hartlepool a bit more often\" - Hartlepool United spokesman Paul Mullen looks on the bright side following the resignation of club president Peter Mandelson from the Government this afternoon.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>CRAZY LEGS, CRAZY DEMANDS</strong></p> <p>Hassan 'Crazy Legs' Kachloul certainly is one of the most popular men in Southampton. Not only does he amuse the locals with his jocular knock-kneed gait, he also curries favour by scoring the odd goal - as well as doing his level best to get right on Leeds striker Alan Smith's tit-end. But sadly for all concerned, it looks as though the love affair between Hassan and Hampshire will soon be over.</p> <p>By turning down an \"extremely generous\" offer from the Southampton board, the Moroccan midfielder today started a transfer tug-of-war between one of English football's \"Big Five\" clubs (Ipswich) and a smaller outfit who will do well to escape relegation (Spurs). \"The club have pushed the boat out as far as we can within our existing pay structure but Hassan has declined the offer of a new two-year contract with us,\" Saints chairman Rupert Lowe said today. \"We hope he changes his mind.\"</p> <p>But although Lowe would like to keep hold of Kachloul, he was realistic enough to agree a fee with Ipswich for a player who wants \u00a325,000-a-week and can leave for nothing at the end of the season. Sadly for George Burley, however, Hassan wasn't done with turning things down and his nose up. \"The player has decided to stay at The Dell until his contract runs out with them in the summer,\" said Burley. \"We will have a look at things again then, but I'm looking to bring new players to the club sooner rather than later.\" Looks like Kachloul could be the first in a long line of Southampton employees on their way to north London, then.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Arsenal sent scouts to watch Middlesbrough's Mark Schwarzer against Liverpool on Saturday, according to reports.</p> <p>West Ham look set to complete the signing of Japanese defender Tsuneyasu Miyamoto from Gamba Osaka in a move that is likely to earn the club millions. Harry Redknapp admitted he has never seen Miyamoto play but with \u00a3250,000-worth of replica shirt sales already guaranteed, he's not too bothered. \"We'll have enough money when we've finished with him to buy Ronaldo,\" he said.</p> <p>Bradford are hoping to sign Hearts wing-back Gary Locke on a free transfer this week.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Stan Collymore is close to completing a move to Spanish club Real Oviedo. Oviedo spokesman Miguel Solis said: \"We are optimistic he may even play this Sunday. We know Collymore's past history and that he has played for several clubs in England. Oviedo is a friendly town and the club is like a family. We are convinced he will settle down here and that above all he will score goals.\"</p> <p>Uefa and Fifa made little progress during talks with the European Commission over changes to the transfer system today. The main stumbling block remains players' contracts: the EC are insisting that contracts between club and players should follow normal European employment law, something Uefa and Fifa are trying to limit.</p> <p>FA chief executive Adam Crozier has admitted received hate mail since appointing Sven-Goran Eriksson as England coach. Crozier said: \"Some of them were quite nasty but you just have to ignore it. There's not a lot I can do about being Scottish though it has only really become a talking-point since Sven was appointed.\"</p> <p>Nigerian defender Taribo West has agreed to remain with Derby until the end of the season. \"It is all in place. In principle everything is agreed and everybody is happy,\" manager Jim Smith admitted. \"All it needs now is for Taribo to complete the forms when he is back in England on Monday.\"</p> <p>Manchester United target Ruud van Nistelrooy is back in training and hopes to be playing again by the end of May. His agent Rodger Linse said: \"Ruud is still in the process of rehabilitation - but doing well. And Manchester United are keen to know how he is doing, especially Mr Ferguson who has been very friendly.\"</p> <p>Alan Shearer hopes to return to the Newcastle side for their match against Manchester City on February 24, following surgery on his knee.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV: The Big Match (11.30pm) [sniff, snivel, moan]</p> <p>Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (6.30pm, 2am) What on earth is McCaff whining about now?</p> <p>The Last Word with Jimmy Hill (7pm, 11pm SS3) [drip drip drip]</p> <p>You're On Sky Sports!

Sadly for George Burley, however, Hassan wasn't done with turning things down and his nose up. \"The player has decided to stay at The Dell until his contract runs out with them in the summer,\" said Burley. \"We will have a look at things again then, but I'm looking to bring new players to the club sooner rather than later.\" Looks like Kachloul could be the first in a long line of Southampton employees on their way to north London, then. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Arsenal sent scouts to watch Middlesbrough's Mark Schwarzer against Liverpool on Saturday, according to reports. West Ham look set to complete the signing of Japanese defender Tsuneyasu Miyamoto from Gamba Osaka in a move that is likely to earn the club millions. Harry Redknapp admitted he has never seen Miyamoto play but with \u00a3250,000-worth of replica shirt sales already guaranteed, he's not too bothered. \"We'll have enough money when we've finished with him to buy Ronaldo,\" he said. Bradford are hoping to sign Hearts wing-back Gary Locke on a free transfer this week. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Stan Collymore is close to completing a move to Spanish club Real Oviedo. Oviedo spokesman Miguel Solis said: \"We are optimistic he may even play this Sunday. We know Collymore's past history and that he has played for several clubs in England. Oviedo is a friendly town and the club is like a family. We are convinced he will settle down here and that above all he will score goals.\" Uefa and Fifa made little progress during talks with the European Commission over changes to the transfer system today. The main stumbling block remains players' contracts: the EC are insisting that contracts between club and players should follow normal European employment law, something Uefa and Fifa are trying to limit. FA chief executive Adam Crozier has admitted received hate mail since appointing Sven-Goran Eriksson as England coach. Crozier said: \"Some of them were quite nasty but you just have to ignore it. There's not a lot I can do about being Scottish though it has only really become a talking-point since Sven was appointed.\" Nigerian defender Taribo West has agreed to remain with Derby until the end of the season. \"It is all in place. In principle everything is agreed and everybody is happy,\" manager Jim Smith admitted. \"All it needs now is for Taribo to complete the forms when he is back in England on Monday.\" Manchester United target Ruud van Nistelrooy is back in training and hopes to be playing again by the end of May. His agent Rodger Linse said: \"Ruud is still in the process of rehabilitation - but doing well. And Manchester United are keen to know how he is doing, especially Mr Ferguson who has been very friendly.\" Alan Shearer hopes to return to the Newcastle side for their match against Manchester City on February 24, following surgery on his knee. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: The Big Match (11.30pm) [sniff, snivel, moan] Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (6.30pm, 2am) What on earth is McCaff whining about now?

      "body": "<p>The BBC's plans to sell advertising on a soon-to-launch international website, BBCNews.com, have been branded a \"clear breach of public service principles\". </p> <p>The British Internet Publishers Alliance has condemned the BBC developing BBCNews.com into a commercial venture that will take content from its licence fee funded services, such as BBC.co.uk. </p> <p>\"The content has been paid for directly by the licence fee, and they are now using it to compete directly against ITN, Reuters, the FT, the Guardian, and other British news providers who are looking to create an international business,\" said Rob Hersov, chairman of BIPA and ceo of Sportal. </p> <p>\"This could be very damaging to the these high-quality British news providers.</p> <p>\"If the BBC keeps setting itself these revenue targets which it claims are necessary to meet its programme-making commitments - \u00a3400m quoted in the FT today - then why does it spend these vast sums online, replicating high-quality private sector services already available?\"</p> <p>The plans have been mooted for more than a year but the BBC has held back from revealing details of how exactly it will structure the venture, instead insisting it was \"discussing\" the issue of a commercially funded international news site. </p> <p>So far the BBC has refused to comment on whether a definite decision has been taken to support the international news website with advertising. A summer launch date has been suggested. </p> <p>An announcement was expected next week but has been put back to \"sometime in the near future\".</p> <p>The site will offer news to an international audience and will not be marketed to licence payers.</p> <p>The BBC said it was a justified move and pointed out that it would draw even more criticism if it didn't try to make money out of foreign, non-licence fee paying audiences.</p> <p>Half the visitors to BBC Online come from overseas. Although the corporation has never revealed how many people visit its sites, it pulls in an estimated 10m users a month, with an average of 200m page impressions per month.</p> <p>The key issues at stake include how much content will be taken from bbc.co.uk/news, a BBC's public service funded website and who exactly within the corporation is stumping up the cash. </p> <p>It is thought that BBC Worldwide has been gunning to take control of BBCNews.com for some time, in order to clear up misunderstandings and draw a boundary between public and commercial. But BBC News has been fighting to keep the website under its control. </p> <p>To this end, BBC Worldwide's internet and interactive division has been developing BBC.com for some time and says it has worked out a way in which it can use technology to tell where a person is logging on from, and direct them to the relevant site. </p> <p>BBC Worldwide has never denied that it would take advertising on BBC.com, which will launch later this year as an \"international portal for overseas visitors to experience the BBC\". </p> <p>BIPA is furious that the BBC can expand at a time when budgets for internet advertising are being slashed by major media corporations. </p> <p>It argues that the corporation has no right under its charter to launch BBCNews.com - and indeed BBC.com - to start competing overseas against other home-grown organisations. </p> <p>BIPA has already lodged a legal complaint with the European Commission, which is currently investigation the BBC's use of state aid. </p> <p>The BBC has already spent more than \u00a3150m on its public service websites, which are widely regarded as among the best in the world.</p> <p>However, the Commission is said to be particularly interested in the \"cross border effects\" of using public funds to prop up businesses overseas. The issues of unfair competition could ultimately hinder the BBC's expansion.</p> <p>The BBC secured the domain name bbcnews.com in October last year after a domain name battle against a US cybersquatter.</p>",

The British Internet Publishers Alliance has condemned the BBC developing BBCNews.com into a commercial venture that will take content from its licence fee funded services, such as BBC.co.uk. \"The content has been paid for directly by the licence fee, and they are now using it to compete directly against ITN, Reuters, the FT, the Guardian, and other British news providers who are looking to create an international business,\" said Rob Hersov, chairman of BIPA and ceo of Sportal. \"This could be very damaging to the these high-quality British news providers. \"If the BBC keeps setting itself these revenue targets which it claims are necessary to meet its programme-making commitments - \u00a3400m quoted in the FT today - then why does it spend these vast sums online, replicating high-quality private sector services already available?\" The plans have been mooted for more than a year but the BBC has held back from revealing details of how exactly it will structure the venture, instead insisting it was \"discussing\" the issue of a commercially funded international news site. So far the BBC has refused to comment on whether a definite decision has been taken to support the international news website with advertising. A summer launch date has been suggested. An announcement was expected next week but has been put back to \"sometime in the near future\". The site will offer news to an international audience and will not be marketed to licence payers. The BBC said it was a justified move and pointed out that it would draw even more criticism if it didn't try to make money out of foreign, non-licence fee paying audiences. Half the visitors to BBC Online come from overseas. Although the corporation has never revealed how many people visit its sites, it pulls in an estimated 10m users a month, with an average of 200m page impressions per month. The key issues at stake include how much content will be taken from bbc.co.uk/news, a BBC's public service funded website and who exactly within the corporation is stumping up the cash. It is thought that BBC Worldwide has been gunning to take control of BBCNews.com for some time, in order to clear up misunderstandings and draw a boundary between public and commercial. But BBC News has been fighting to keep the website under its control. To this end, BBC Worldwide's internet and interactive division has been developing BBC.com for some time and says it has worked out a way in which it can use technology to tell where a person is logging on from, and direct them to the relevant site. BBC Worldwide has never denied that it would take advertising on BBC.com, which will launch later this year as an \"international portal for overseas visitors to experience the BBC\". BIPA is furious that the BBC can expand at a time when budgets for internet advertising are being slashed by major media corporations. It argues that the corporation has no right under its charter to launch BBCNews.com - and indeed BBC.com - to start competing overseas against other home-grown organisations. BIPA has already lodged a legal complaint with the European Commission, which is currently investigation the BBC's use of state aid. The BBC has already spent more than \u00a3150m on its public service websites, which are widely regarded as among the best in the world. However, the Commission is said to be particularly interested in the \"cross border effects\" of using public funds to prop up businesses overseas. The issues of unfair competition could ultimately hinder the BBC's expansion. The BBC secured the domain name bbcnews.com in October last year after a domain name battle against a US cybersquatter.",

One of the most traumatised victims of Britain's worst child sex abuse scandal, he hoped to use compensation money to rebuild his life and go to college. </p> <p>To his shock, however, the former resident of Bryn Alyn children's home, north Wales, has been warned he is unlikely to receive a penny of a \u00a350,000 settlement because it has all been eaten up in legal costs totalling almost \u00a3200,000. His plight has been described as \"extraordinary\" by the legal services commission, formerly the legal aid board. </p> <p>Savio, now 30, is one of a growing number of former children's home residents who, despite being proven abuse victims, are failing to get any money for the pain and damage they have suffered. At least six others are considering suing lawyers who, they allege, advised them to abandon compensation claims halfway through a battle for damages. </p> <p>All are victims of a legal system that stands in the way of successful claims against institutions, according to child abuse solicitors who are calling for changes in the funding of legal costs in complex and drawn out cases. They also say urgent action is needed to simplify the compensation system. </p> <p>Official figures suggest more than 2,000 people have begun civil proceedings for compensation for abuse they suffered in care in England and Wales. But it is thought there could eventually be as many as 15,000 potential claimants. Most, like Savio, are young men - many of whom have been pursuing claims for more than five years over abuse that happened as long as 30 years ago. </p> <p>Time lags such as these cause particular problems, according to Peter Garsden, executive officer of the Association of Child Abuse Solicitors. \"There are frequently difficulties in locating documents, which may be destroyed,\" he says. \"Add to this the strict time limits, within which proceedings should be issued, and an obstructive defence which makes technical points in the hope of wearing down the claimant who is already very vulnerable.\" </p> <p>Savio's case is a tragic example of how the system can add to the trauma suffered by abuse victims. Unable to escape the horrors that haunt him, he says he has tried to commit suicide 10 times. The last attempt was less than 12 months ago, when his solicitors told him he was \"unlikely\" to receive any money for a settlement they had just reached. A week later, details of the assaults he suffered, along with hundreds of other vulnerable young people at Bryn Alyn and other children's homes in north Wales, were catalogued with publication of the Waterhouse report, the biggest inquiry into child abuse in Britain. </p> <p>For Savio, who grew up thinking it was normal for men to have sex with boys, it was a despair he hoped he would never know again. In 1995, there was a justice of sorts when his abuser John Allen, former head of Bryn Alyn, was jailed for six years for indecent assault of boys in his care. Twelve months later, his hopes of a fresh start rose when his solicitors, Stephens Innocent (now Finers Stephens Innocent), claimed for damages for psychological disturbance caused by neglect, maltreatment and physical and sexual abuse he suffered between the ages of four and 18 while in local authority care. </p> <p>Writs were issued in 1996 against Warwickshire county council, Bryn Alyn Community Holdings and Royal Insurance, the home's insurers. All contested the claims - and the solicitors spent the next three years trawling through files for evidence. During that time, Bryn Alyn Community Holdings went into liquidation. </p> <p>In July 1999, Stephens Innocent said Savio would accept a settlement of \u00a350,000 from Warwickshire, after the authority offered to pay \u00a330,000. The higher figure was agreed in January 2000. Around the same time, an agreement was reached with Bryn Alyn Community Holdings and Royal Insurance that Savio would discontinue the action with no order for costs except legal aid assessment. </p> <p>It is understood that a separate group action against Bryn Alyn will be heard in court next month. </p> <p>Savio recalls: \"I was told I had to accept the settlement - otherwise my legal aid would be withdrawn and I would get nothing. I had hoped for more than \u00a350,000. In one case that has gone to court, someone has received \u00a3180,000. All I wanted was enough money to go to college, get a flat and start my life again.\" </p> <p>Within days of the agreement, Savio was devastated to receive a letter from Nicola Solomon, a partner at Stephens Innocent, setting out the implications of the settlement. She explained: \"It is likely you will not receive more than the \u00a31,500 in the end; in fact, it is quite likely that the whole of the \u00a350,000 will go in legal costs\". </p> <p>The news tipped Savio over the edge. He cut his wrists and took an overdose. He was discovered almost dead on the beach at Brighton, where he lives. \"Someone found me and I was taken to hospital,\" recalls Savio, who has spent the last 12 months in despair. \"I have put the last five years of my life into this - all for nothing.\" </p> <p>Solomon insists she is \"very disappointed\" with the outcome of Savio's claim. \"It is an extraordinary situation which is very unjust to Zak,\" she says. However, she adds that she painted a worst-case scenario in her letter - and that she hopes to be able to secure some money for him following a court assessment of costs in June. Asked about the decision to settle, she says it was taken on counsel's advice. \"We were advised that we would not get more than \u00a350,000 overall from all three claimants - the maximum we could hope for. The decision to settle was made on that basis. \" </p> <p> The case has shocked the legal services commission. \"It is very unusual for a damages award to end up being much less than the costs of a case,\" says spokesman Colin Stutt. Legal aid would have been awarded on the understanding that any damages would outweigh the cost, he explains. New rules, introduced under the Access to Justice Act, mean there are extra controls on cases expected to cost \u00a325,000 or more, for which all costs have to be agreed in advance by the commission. </p> <p>These controls should prevent a repeat of Savio's case. But Garsden, who represents 700 abuse claimants, wants major changes in the way all compensation claims are handled. </p> <p>\"There are all sorts of ways in which the process of compensation could be made simpler for claimants,\" he says. \"First, the burden of proof should be on the defendant, not the claimant. Defendants would have to prove how well they looked after the claimant. </p> <p>\"We also need to see all records at a much earlier stage. We have had enormous difficulty getting hold of social care records. In some cases, the names of abusers have been deleted. We also need to lift the time limitation so cases aren't hurried together. Furthermore, employers should not be able to argue that they are not responsible for the abuse of their employees. Finally, costs must be proportionate to the damages recovered. At the moment, they have no bearing on the amount of damages received.\" </p> <p>Such changes would bring small comfort to Savio, who has to be content with a \u00a31,500 loan from his solicitors - repayable if there is money left in the settlement once the costs have been sorted. </p> <p>Debbie Jones, director of Voices in Care, a charity which campaigned for 11 years for the north Wales inquiry, sums it up. \"Zak has been betrayed in every stage of his life,\" she says. \"All he wanted was justice and a quality of life. Now he is a victim again.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ailing Marks &amp; Spencer took another turn for the worse yesterday as it confirmed appalling Christmas trading figures and admitted that its clothes are \"simply not good enough\". </p> <p>The figures were the worst of any leading high street chain, with like-for-like sales 5.1% down in the 16 weeks to January 20 and underlying sales of general, non-food merchandise collapsing by 9.6% . It is the third year in a row that M&amp;S sales have lurched downwards over Christmas. </p> <p>Clothing, footwear and gifts were the worst peforming departments, with like-for-like sales estimated to be down 11.2%. </p> <p>The group admitted that many of its new \"concept stores\" - on which it has pinned hopes of a turnaround - have been falling well short of expectations. </p> <p>Luc Vandevelde, the chairman who two months ago promised real sales growth and a \"wonderful Christmas\", now says the stores needs better merchandise for there to be an about-turn. </p> <p>The adult clothing ranges had \"inconsistent appeal\" which left M&amp;S with too much stock to clear at marked down prices and needed \"consistently better design\". </p> <p>Mr Vandevelde blamed previous management for many of the problems - accusing his predecessors of lacking objectivity - and blamed himself for not getting rid of them all earlier. </p> <p>The former chief executive, Peter Salsbury, left only four months ago and his replacement, Roger Holmes, recruited from electrical retailer Comet, has only just started work. </p> <p>Yesterday Robert Colvill - the finance director and only member of the old guard left in the boardroom - said M&amp;S was drafting in new designers to put clothes on the racks that shoppers want to buy. </p> <p>\"We need to get new blood into the regime,\" he said. \"Good goods is the only answer.\" </p> <p>Richard Ratner, analyst at Seymour Pierce, was unimpressed. \"We all know the problem is the clothing. We could have told them that.\" </p> <p>He had little confidence that M&amp;S was capable of delivering on its promises. \"You can dress a pig up how you like, but it it is still a pig.\" </p> <p>Mr Colvill confirmed that the experiment with concept stores - with goods grouped by lifestyle and as outfits, rather than on racks of skirts, trousers or blouses - has not been a resounding success. </p> <p>M&amp;S spent up to \u00a34m each to refurbish 23 stores, but they performed only 4% better than comparable stores which were not revamped. Trading at some concept stores had deteriorated. \"We need to get to the bottom of it,\" said Mr Colvill. </p> <p>When Mr Vandevelde took over last year he promised a turnaround by the start of 2002. Yesterday Mr Colvill said: \"Luc said he would turn it round within a two-year time frame and he stands by that. But there is no premium for us to say when the turn will come.\" </p> <p>There were bright spots. Food sales were ahead 2.1% and home furnishings an estimated 11.4%. Gross margins rose 0.8%. </p> <p>The shares climbed 5.5p to 205.5p, mainly on relief that the figures were not worse. Analysts were still urging investors to sell. </p> <p><strong> Store sales Like-for-like Period</strong> </p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer*</strong> -9.6% 16weeks to Jan 20 </p> <p>Next 6.0% 19 weeks to Dec 24 </p> <p>Matalan 16.3% 6 weeks to Jan 6 </p> <p>House of Fraser 6.0% 23 weeks to Jan 6 </p> <p>Debenhams 7.0% 6 weeks to Xmas </p> <p>Boots -1.5% 13 weeks to Dec 30 </p> <p>Arcadia 4.3% 20 weeks to Jan 13 </p> <p>(*Clothing, footwear, homeware, gifts etc, excludes food)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ailing Marks &amp; Spencer took another turn for the worse yesterday as it confirmed appalling Christmas trading figures and admitted that its clothes are \"simply not good enough\". The figures were the worst of any leading high street chain, with like-for-like sales 5.1% down in the 16 weeks to January 20 and underlying sales of general, non-food merchandise collapsing by 9.6% . It is the third year in a row that M&amp;S sales have lurched downwards over Christmas. Clothing, footwear and gifts were the worst peforming departments, with like-for-like sales estimated to be down 11.2%. The group admitted that many of its new \"concept stores\" - on which it has pinned hopes of a turnaround - have been falling well short of expectations. Luc Vandevelde, the chairman who two months ago promised real sales growth and a \"wonderful Christmas\", now says the stores needs better merchandise for there to be an about-turn. The adult clothing ranges had \"inconsistent appeal\" which left M&amp;S with too much stock to clear at marked down prices and needed \"consistently better design\". Mr Vandevelde blamed previous management for many of the problems - accusing his predecessors of lacking objectivity - and blamed himself for not getting rid of them all earlier. The former chief executive, Peter Salsbury, left only four months ago and his replacement, Roger Holmes, recruited from electrical retailer Comet, has only just started work. Yesterday Robert Colvill - the finance director and only member of the old guard left in the boardroom - said M&amp;S was drafting in new designers to put clothes on the racks that shoppers want to buy. \"We need to get new blood into the regime,\" he said. \"Good goods is the only answer.\" Richard Ratner, analyst at Seymour Pierce, was unimpressed. \"We all know the problem is the clothing. We could have told them that.\" He had little confidence that M&amp;S was capable of delivering on its promises. \"You can dress a pig up how you like, but it it is still a pig.\" Mr Colvill confirmed that the experiment with concept stores - with goods grouped by lifestyle and as outfits, rather than on racks of skirts, trousers or blouses - has not been a resounding success. M&amp;S spent up to \u00a34m each to refurbish 23 stores, but they performed only 4% better than comparable stores which were not revamped. Trading at some concept stores had deteriorated. \"We need to get to the bottom of it,\" said Mr Colvill. When Mr Vandevelde took over last year he promised a turnaround by the start of 2002. Yesterday Mr Colvill said: \"Luc said he would turn it round within a two-year time frame and he stands by that. But there is no premium for us to say when the turn will come.\" There were bright spots. Food sales were ahead 2.1% and home furnishings an estimated 11.4%. Gross margins rose 0.8%. The shares climbed 5.5p to 205.5p, mainly on relief that the figures were not worse. Analysts were still urging investors to sell. Store sales Like-for-like Period Marks &amp; Spencer* -9.6% 16weeks to Jan 20 Next 6.0% 19 weeks to Dec 24 Matalan 16.3% 6 weeks to Jan 6 House of Fraser 6.0% 23 weeks to Jan 6 Debenhams 7.0% 6 weeks to Xmas Boots -1.5% 13 weeks to Dec 30 Arcadia 4.3% 20 weeks to Jan 13 (*Clothing, footwear, homeware, gifts etc, excludes food)",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Peter Mandelson should not have been brought down by his own spin, but twice he has been. How has this happened? As his spin doctor for three years, I saw how he often delivered for the Labour party, but failed to look after himself.</p> <p>Until he joined the cabinet in 1998, he spent 13 years trying to persuade the media and the public that his plans to modernise the Labour party were the right ones. In doing so he provided his colleagues - from Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair to Gordon Brown - with invaluable support.</p> <p>Not only did he do their bidding and spinning but he took it upon himself, unwisely perhaps as it now turns out, to build relations with powerful and influential people. In doing so, he gained a strong network of contacts outside Westminster, but only a few within the House of Commons - where he was simply accused of being behind every leak or dark manoeuvre.</p> <p>It was never quite as simple as that, but to his colleagues and enemies he was always the easiest target. He both relished and abhorred this reputation. You can be certain that those senior figures he served were always grateful to have him there and desperately sorry that he has gone today. It is this legacy which has left him, this afternoon, at the end of his frontline political career.</p> <p>And that is the paradox of his resignation. Despite having the prime minister as his most powerful ally in Westminster, he has been unable to summon any support from his colleagues or the media. While there appears to be nothing improper in his involvement in the passport application of Srichand Hinduja, he has not been able to fight off the attacks from all sides.</p> <p>What's more, while the advice which he has given his political masters over the years has been spot on, he has never had the time to develop a political persona for himself. That's left him with blind spots when he has come under pressure, as he did on Saturday, when the response given on his behalf to the Observer over the passport application was unclear.</p> <p>However, despite this lack of personal political nous, it would be wrong to say that he does not have his own values. Through his relationships with senior colleagues, he managed to implement many of the things he strongly believed in. Kinnock would not have ditched unilateralism when he did without him; and Blair would not have remained as committed in principle to the euro had Mandelson not argued the case in private and public.</p> <p>He will have the strength to rebuild himself, just as he did two years ago after his home loan resignation. As a friend and former colleague, I hope he keeps out of politics and builds the satisfying and fulfilling life that he deserves.</p> <p><b>Full text</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">The resignation speech</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/nireland/\">Northern Ireland</a></p> <p><b>Picture gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Mandelson: a career in photos</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">Peter Mandelson announces his resignation (3mins 30)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124white.ra\">Michael White at Westminster (2mins 14)</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427479,00.html\">24.01.2001: Mandelson resigns</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427481,00.html\">24.01.2001: Analysis by Nicholas Watt - Farewell Mandelson, brilliant but unloved</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427491,00.html\">24.01.2001: Fish and sympathy from Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427475,00.html\">24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,427264,00.html\">Profile: Srichand Hinduja</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427465,00.html\">24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,427417,00.html\">Steve Bell on Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say: should Mandelson have quit?</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Press briefing</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Northern Ireland Office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a><br><a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson should not have been brought down by his own spin, but twice he has been. How has this happened? As his spin doctor for three years, I saw how he often delivered for the Labour party, but failed to look after himself. Until he joined the cabinet in 1998, he spent 13 years trying to persuade the media and the public that his plans to modernise the Labour party were the right ones. In doing so he provided his colleagues - from Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair to Gordon Brown - with invaluable support. Not only did he do their bidding and spinning but he took it upon himself, unwisely perhaps as it now turns out, to build relations with powerful and influential people. In doing so, he gained a strong network of contacts outside Westminster, but only a few within the House of Commons - where he was simply accused of being behind every leak or dark manoeuvre. It was never quite as simple as that, but to his colleagues and enemies he was always the easiest target. He both relished and abhorred this reputation. You can be certain that those senior figures he served were always grateful to have him there and desperately sorry that he has gone today. It is this legacy which has left him, this afternoon, at the end of his frontline political career. And that is the paradox of his resignation. Despite having the prime minister as his most powerful ally in Westminster, he has been unable to summon any support from his colleagues or the media. While there appears to be nothing improper in his involvement in the passport application of Srichand Hinduja, he has not been able to fight off the attacks from all sides. What's more, while the advice which he has given his political masters over the years has been spot on, he has never had the time to develop a political persona for himself. That's left him with blind spots when he has come under pressure, as he did on Saturday, when the response given on his behalf to the Observer over the passport application was unclear. However, despite this lack of personal political nous, it would be wrong to say that he does not have his own values. Through his relationships with senior colleagues, he managed to implement many of the things he strongly believed in. Kinnock would not have ditched unilateralism when he did without him; and Blair would not have remained as committed in principle to the euro had Mandelson not argued the case in private and public. He will have the strength to rebuild himself, just as he did two years ago after his home loan resignation. As a friend and former colleague, I hope he keeps out of politics and builds the satisfying and fulfilling life that he deserves.

      "bodyText": "Finding a successor to veteran Royal College of Nursing (RCN) general secretary Christine Hancock that would satisfy competing factions in the college was always going to be tough. Ms Hancock will take up the presidency of the international conference of nurses in June, having built up a reputation as the UK's most powerful nurse, a smart operator who has given the college a high media profile and policy influence. Her departure has activated the latent power struggle between the RCN's activist wing - who would like to see the RCN become like a trade union - and the establishment wing, who would like to see it become more like a medical royal college. The non-shortlisting of Tom Bolger, Ms Hancock's deputy for the past 10 years, Pippa Gough, the college's policy unit head, and Jane Salvage, a nurse and journalist (and outspoken critic of the RCN under Ms Hancock), is seen as a snub to the activist wing. But it is difficult, on the face of it, to see the shortlist as a roll call of the establishment or as a sign that the current RCN leadership is seeking to perpetuate the status quo. A SocietyGuardian.co.uk article last November noted that Alison Kitson, the director of the RCN institute regarded as a front runner for the top job, was likely to \"shock matron\" with her \"spiky hair and leather trousers\". An RCN insider, but hardly establishment, even if her detractors regard her as a \"policy wonk\" and allegedly not the most streetwise of political operators. Ms Kitson's closest rival, according to press reports, is Beverly Malone, a black American nurse union leader and aide to former President Bill Clinton. A glance at her track record shows high calibre political credentials, extensive experience in both clinical and academic areas, and a public profile in the US that pushed her onto an Ebony magazine list of the \"100 most prominent African-Americans\". A decision on the appointment is expected in the next few days, possibly - but not necessarily - after RCN council meets in Belfast on Friday and Saturday this week. Commenting on the today's Guardian article, an RCN spokesperson said: \"After advertising in The Guardian, The Sunday Times and Nursing Standard, as well as using an executive search consultancy, a shortlist was drawn up and interviews are taking place. \"As with any employment process it is impossible to say exactly when an announcement will be made, because this will be affected by the current circumstances of the appointee.\"",

That's how you got pregnant.\" </p> <p>I didn't reply; I couldn't. I didn't know what to say. \"Was it in the night or in the day?\" I was still silent. \"I bet it was in the night, so I couldn't see you.\" </p> <p>A friend calls it the \"new birds 'n' bees\" - having to explain to any sibling, and then the children themselves, that conception was not in a moment of passion but in a petri dish. My daughter has just come to grips with the mechanics of the old-fashioned two-in-a-bed method and is immensely proud of her newfound knowledge, imparting it to any ignorant schoolmates and elderly aunts for its shockability value. </p> <p>How can I tell her that this isn't how her very own mum and dad have gone about the baby business? That the deliciously naughty sex was not something we had indulged in to produce her twin siblings. An entirely different method was employed, where the time of day didn't matter under the glare of laboratory lights. </p> <p>I miss the assisted conception unit. I have been cut loose from its care. I will never have to go into that waiting room again, flick through the messy piles of free leaflets (Mucus Hostility, Fibroids, Assisted Hatching, Adoption UK) and try to jumpstart the broken coffee machine when our appointment is running late (again). </p> <p>I harbour a strange nostalgia for a time of intense longing. For a while now I have wanted to call them, on some flimsy pretext.

Now, according to the medical profession, I'm just another pregnant woman. </p> <p>But according to nearly everyone else, I am not. \"How's your infertility treatment going?\" asked a friend, my belly bulging between us. When will my infertility treatment become a pregnancy like anyone else's? But it is not only how others see our post-treatment progress, but how we see ourselves. </p> <p>\"I found it almost impossible to say that I was pregnant, it seemed too normal.

It makes me uncomfortable. I do not like the display of our offspring as different, defined by their experiences when a mere cluster of cells. On the long road to adult life, a few days in a lab seems of little significance unless we chose to make it so. </p> <p>Perhaps we barren women are reluctant to surrender our special status. Perhaps, despite our plea that all we desire is the easy joy of parenthood others take for granted, when faced with being just another number at the antenatal clinic, it is a bit of a let-down. At my appointment with the consultant obstetrician last week, I asked if he could be at the birth, and he laughed. Why should he oversee the arrival of my children more than anyone else's? As far as he was concerned, my pregnancy was a pretty standard matter. </p> <p>It was a sobering moment, which at first made me wince. How could he be so cruel? I began to argue: \"It's been a long road to get this far ...\" as if he should care how the milky forms hovering on the ultrasound screen came to be his prenatal patients. Who cares whether or not their parents had sex to conceive them? He clearly didn't. </p> <p>At some point, I will explain to my seven-year-old how her siblings were conceived, as I will explain to them. My daughter may even find, to her great enjoyment, that the true story is more shocking to elderly aunts than her parents having sex in the dark. </p> <p>But I hope it won't be shocking to anyone else. I hope they consider it no more defining of her siblings than the obstetrician did. My twins will not be Miss and Master April in the AceBabes calendar. They will just be spring babies.

Today, he is going for the tuberculosis vaccine too. So I am keen on vaccines! However, when my son's invitation for the MMR jab arrives shortly, he won't be going - at least not for a couple of years. I am acting in legal claims for a number of parents who believe the vaccine has seriously injured their child.

Before it was introduced in these countries, it underwent trials to make sure it was safe and effective. By 1988, when it was introduced in the UK, we had the benefit of many years of experience which confirmed that serious side-effects were uncommon. In 1998, Dr Wakefield and colleagues suggested there might be a connection between the vaccine and both autism and bowel problems. Studies were set up to look into the possibility. They have not confirmed Dr Wakefield's suggestion.<br><strong>Verdict: No</strong></p> <p><strong> Judith Barnard</strong><br><strong> Communications director, National Autistic Society </strong><br> </p> <p>That is a question for the medical establishment which can only be answered by more research. Given the thousands of calls about MMR to the NAS each year, parents are not convinced. A number report that autism started in their children, who had been progressing well, directly after the MMR jab, but the link cannot be proved. We are committed to immunisation and protecting children against measles, mumps and rubella but cannot advise parents either way. The government should direct its \u00a33m into that research, not advertising campaigns.<br><strong>Verdict: Jury still out</strong></p> <p><strong> Magda Taylor</strong> <br><strong>Coordinator, The Informed Parent </strong><br> </p> <p>There is much cause for doubt about the jab, from the way that it is injected and what it is made of, to the safety of combining the three inoculations. Before the vaccine was introduced, the death rate from measles had already fallen by 95%. The colossal scale of the drugs industry is enough to make some people sceptical, and the health service so quickly and absolutely dismisses public fears that it appears to be avoiding confronting serious issues. Many people are not even told about the yellow card system to report suspected reactions to vaccines. <br><strong>Verdict: Yes</strong></p> <p><strong> Dr George Kassianos</strong> <br><strong>Spokesman, Royal College of General Practitioners </strong><br> </p> <p>There is no doubt in my mind that there is no reason to doubt the safety of the MMR jab. Yesterday's summit found that Dr Wakefield's report was riddled with inaccuracies and did not prove links between the vaccine and autism or gut problems, along with all other studies around the world on the subject. The vaccine was tested sufficiently to be granted a licence, and these licences are not granted permanently. The medical control agency demands reviews at least every five years - irrespective of how many yellow cards it may have received.<br>Verdict: No</p>",

Verdict: No Judith Barnard Communications director, National Autistic Society That is a question for the medical establishment which can only be answered by more research. Given the thousands of calls about MMR to the NAS each year, parents are not convinced. A number report that autism started in their children, who had been progressing well, directly after the MMR jab, but the link cannot be proved. We are committed to immunisation and protecting children against measles, mumps and rubella but cannot advise parents either way. The government should direct its \u00a33m into that research, not advertising campaigns. Verdict: Jury still out Magda Taylor Coordinator, The Informed Parent There is much cause for doubt about the jab, from the way that it is injected and what it is made of, to the safety of combining the three inoculations. Before the vaccine was introduced, the death rate from measles had already fallen by 95%. The colossal scale of the drugs industry is enough to make some people sceptical, and the health service so quickly and absolutely dismisses public fears that it appears to be avoiding confronting serious issues. Many people are not even told about the yellow card system to report suspected reactions to vaccines. Verdict: Yes Dr George Kassianos Spokesman, Royal College of General Practitioners There is no doubt in my mind that there is no reason to doubt the safety of the MMR jab. Yesterday's summit found that Dr Wakefield's report was riddled with inaccuracies and did not prove links between the vaccine and autism or gut problems, along with all other studies around the world on the subject. The vaccine was tested sufficiently to be granted a licence, and these licences are not granted permanently. The medical control agency demands reviews at least every five years - irrespective of how many yellow cards it may have received. Verdict: No",

Within a few seconds, her fists clench and her blonde curls shake with rage until her frustration explodes into an ear-splitting howl. People are looking on, embarrassed by the spectacle. </p> <p>For many parents, the experience is horribly familiar. Who, after all, has not had to endure those nerve-shredding tantrums that make you yearn for the carefree days of childlessness, those public eruptions of petulance that test your patience to its limits? </p> <p>Except that, in this case, Dorothy is not a temperamental toddler demanding crisps before dinner. She is a 52-year-old child psychologist with a novel, hands-on approach to \"toddler-taming\". Since December, Dorothy Einon, a senior lecturer in psychology at University College, London, has been running temper tantrum workshops: a pilot scheme designed to help parents struggling to cope with particularly unruly children. Among the methods she uses to restore her clients' sanity is a role-play exercise in which adults simulate their child's worst behaviour. </p> <p>Presenting each parent with an abstract drawing, Dorothy asks them to describe the picture without using words. Their ensuing frustration, she believes, provides at least some understanding of their child's feelings. And Dorothy is more than happy to show how it's done. </p> <p>\"The aim is to hammer home just how hard it is to communicate without adequate language,\" she explains, a little flushed from her dramatic demonstration. \"A child's inability to express its needs is a common reason for tantrums. The exercise helps parents to understand something of what their toddler is going through.\" </p> <p>According to research, tantrums affect around 80% of children, usually those between two and four, the age when children first recognise themselves as individuals but fail to comprehend that their parents have minds and emotions separate from their own. When children, bafflingly, find that their desires don't correspond with a parent's, all hell can break loose. </p> <p>Although naturally stubborn youngsters are more likely to have tantrums, even the most placid child is not immune. A recent news story revealed that six-year-old Richie Phommachanh - the spiritually aware \"Golden Child\" of Tibetan Buddhism - can headbang with the best of them, his path to enlightenment hindered by a tendency to throw a wobbly whenever anyone else plays with his ceremonial gong. </p> <p>And which parent did not experience an intense moment of \"There, but for the grace of God, go I ...\" on reading recently about the fit thrown by five-year-old Anna Engstrom when she was supposed to be presenting a posy to Princess Anne. \"I don't want to give it to her,\" shrieked Anna, to the chagrin of her mother, Jill Dale. \"She's horrible.\" The reason for the foot-stomping sulk, it later transpired, was that Anna is a big Barbie fan and fully expected the Princess to be wearing a pink gown and tiara. Instead, she was wearing a sensible blue coat. Such are life's disappointments. </p> <p>Today, however, Dorothy Einon has set her sights on two lesser mortals - my own two-year-old, Reuben, and his best friend, Lucy. Although Reuben is a tantrum novice, yet to progress beyond the basic car-seat showdowns, Lucy is a veteran. Not yet three, she has already held more street protests than Tony Benn, while her pi\u00e8ce-de-r\u00e9sistance - a high-octane fusion of pavement-pounding and knicker-shredding - draws gasps of amazement whenever it is performed. </p> <p>To begin the session, Dorothy wants to know how I deal with Reuben's car-seat insurrections. Like everyone else, I tell her: with a muttering of expletives under my breath, before pinning him, Kendo Nagasaki-style, into submission. Dorothy shakes her head sympathetically. Remaining cool, calm and collected, apparently, is the correct way to proceed. </p> <p>To quell the storm, Dorothy recommends removing yourself physically from the fray for a few minutes. If that is not possible, then withdraw your \"emotional bond\" by ignoring the child as best you can until their anger subsides. When the tantrum is over, be sure to forgive and forget. \"Reassure the child of your love. Children who are quickly forgiven will stop their tantrums at an earlier age.\" </p> <p>Even better, learn to avoid the sort of scenario likely to trigger a tantrum in the first place. Do not take your child to the supermarket when she or he is tired. Do not snatch your computer keyboard from his inquisitive fingers (as I learned this morning). Do not force her to give a bunch of flowers to Princess Anne. </p> <p>Research suggests that today's parents are more concerned about tantrums than ever before. Certainly, there is renewed interest in the issue. In the documentary Living by the Book, to be shown on Channel 4 tonight, four sets of parents try to pacify their demanding darlings with the help of Toddler Taming, the no-nonsense manual written by an Australian paediatrician, Dr Christopher Green. </p> <p>As the programme shows, the results prove to be mixed, perhaps not surprisingly given Green's doctrine of tough love, which tends to treat infants as if they were domestic animals and includes dishing out the occasional \"light, symbolic smack\". </p> <p>A more forward-looking approach is being offered by Kids Unlimited, one of the UK's leading nursery chains, which is now training its staff to use sign language to improve communication with small children. Child development specialists in the US have already shown that by learning simple hand gestures - easier to form than spoken words - babies and toddlers are better able to express their needs, leading in turn to fewer freakouts (though I have a fair inkling of the hand gesture Reuben will soon be giving me). </p> <p>Einon's work in the field has led to a collaboration with the BBC on a television character called Angelmouse, a cheeky-but-caring cartoon rodent designed to fill our little ones with community spirit and positive social values. Each workshop begins with a 10-minute video in which Angelmouse demonstrates his sense of civic duty by saving an elephant from drowning in a pond. Repeated viewing, it is hoped, will reduce tantrums as Angelmouse teaches children how \"to more positively channel their energies\". </p> <p>Today, though, his saintly aspirations aren't much appreciated. After a few minutes, Reuben and Lucy seem to have dismissed him as an ingratiating do-gooder. My son starts demanding a Noddy video, featuring his preferred animated rodent, Clockwork Mouse (a charmless character entirely devoid of any instinct for civic responsibility). </p> <p>\"Mmm, perhaps we'll come back to Angelmouse later,\" Dorothy smiles weakly, as Lucy starts running around in circles. </p> <p>The role-play, too, is sadly curtailed when Dorothy's faux tantrum quickly reduces Reuben to a sobbing heap. But as the session draws to a tearful close, Einon signs off with a final, persuasive warning: fail to wean your child off tantrums as a toddler and there is a strong likelihood they will continue having anger problems well into adulthood. </p> <p>A vision flashes before me: Reuben, at 30, throwing Elton John-style hissy fits.

Deconstructing our parents' parenting abilities, examining them in minute detail and finding them wanting, is a rite of passage. When we become parents ourselves, we are often more forgiving, perhaps because as well as facing the same problems, we know we will eventually face the same scrutiny. </p> <p>For a minority of parents, though, detailed scrutiny comes not as a postmortem to parenting, but as a prequel. In most cases, an individual or couple seeking to adopt a child in Britain has his or her life, or their lives, studied under the microscope in a way that few of us would find easy or comfortable to accept. </p> <p>Janet, who with her partner has recently been given the go-ahead to adopt a child, admits that the six-month selection process was exhaustive and intense. \"In the case of our agency, we had to give written answers to well over 100 questions - and I'm talking essays in some cases, certainly not one-word replies,\" she says. \"It was very time-consuming, very thorough. Among other things, we were asked about our sex life, our relationships with our parents, our views on bringing up children, our financial status, our health and our views on Britain as a multiracial society. </p> <p>\"It was made clear to me that, were we to stand any chance of being passed as adopters, one of us would have to give up work to care for the children. I would have to stop treatment for infertility, and we would have to provide witnesses to attest to our suitability for parenting.\" </p> <p>At one point, Janet worried that the fact that she smoked occasionally might affect the outcome of her application. \"At one level, it's very tough and intrusive, and you feel you're being judged the whole time,\" she says. \"But on the other hand, you know why it's being done - that it's for the protection of the child. And I have to say that, when you're going through it, it's less awful than you would imagine.\" </p> <p>That is not always the view of those whose applications are turned down. Sara, who with her partner tried unsuccessfully to adopt a child from overseas, says she will never get over being rejected. \"We were never told why and we never will be,\" she says. </p> <p>\"We know in our hearts that we could love and care for a child, and it seems so unfair that while others can just have baby after baby without anyone questioning their motives at all, everything about us was put under the spotlight - and, in the end, found wanting. </p> <p>\"It's very, very hard to walk away from that: I find it so difficult to accept that they were right, that we just weren't up to it. After all, parenting is something you learn as you go along: you get better. Only, we weren't given the chance.\" </p> <p>What is clear is that society in general, and social workers in particular, have very different criteria by which to judge whether birth parents are doing a \"good enough\" job, and whether prospective adoptive parents can do the job at all. \"Which is completely obvious when you consider how vulnerable adoptive children are, how they have already had a traumatic time and how they are going to have to deal with this issue of having been adopted later on in their lives,\" says Dirk Flower, a child psychologist. </p> <p>Particularly ironic to would-be adoptive parents is that, when a very young child can no longer be cared for by a birth parent, social workers often try to elicit a stand-in from the ranks of family members who have never sought to adopt: it is as if their blood ties alone inevitably make them better-placed to parent than any amount of longing and desire - and potential competence - on the part of an unrelated couple. </p> <p>\"What you want to do is leave the door open, ajar a little way, so that the birth parents themselves can come back in later on and play a bigger role,\" explains one social worker. \"What you're thinking about, all the time, is the needs of the child. That is your concern - not the needs of the parent, but the needs of the child.\" </p> <p>Most intriguing of all, in the Kilshaw case, is that Flintshire social services evidently has serious doubts about the couple's ability to be parents to the six-month-old twin girls they adopted, but consider them adequate to care for their own two young sons. Quite why this should be the case is difficult to fathom: but in the weeks and months ahead, as the focus moves from media to courtroom, we may get something of an explanation.</p>",

Particularly ironic to would-be adoptive parents is that, when a very young child can no longer be cared for by a birth parent, social workers often try to elicit a stand-in from the ranks of family members who have never sought to adopt: it is as if their blood ties alone inevitably make them better-placed to parent than any amount of longing and desire - and potential competence - on the part of an unrelated couple. \"What you want to do is leave the door open, ajar a little way, so that the birth parents themselves can come back in later on and play a bigger role,\" explains one social worker. \"What you're thinking about, all the time, is the needs of the child. That is your concern - not the needs of the parent, but the needs of the child.\" Most intriguing of all, in the Kilshaw case, is that Flintshire social services evidently has serious doubts about the couple's ability to be parents to the six-month-old twin girls they adopted, but consider them adequate to care for their own two young sons. Quite why this should be the case is difficult to fathom: but in the weeks and months ahead, as the focus moves from media to courtroom, we may get something of an explanation.",

      "bodyText": "Arsenal's latest goalkeeping target, according to the Daily Star, is Middlesbrough's Mark Schwarzer. The paper claims that Arsene Wenger sent scouts to watch the \u00a35m-rated 28-year-old against Liverpool on Saturday. The paper also claims that Austrian keeper Alex Manninger will be allowed to leave Highbury in the summer. The Mirror reports that if, as expected, Tottenham's new owners Enic look to replace George Graham with Glenn Hoddle in the summer, there is a clause in the Southampton manager's contract that would allow him to leave the Dell for \u00a3750,000. Spurs paid Leeds \u00a33m to get hold of Graham. West Ham look set to complete the signing of Japanese defender Tsuneyasu Miyamoto from Gamba Osaka in a move that is likely to earn the club millions. Harry Redknapp told the Mirror he has never seen Miyamoto play but with \u00a3250,000-worth of replica shirt sales already guaranteed, he's not too bothered. \"We'll have enough money when we've finished with him to buy Ronaldo,\" he said. Ruud van Nistelrooy returned to light training with PSV Eindhoven yesterday, and told the Daily Mail how his \"feeling for Manchester United is still great\". He told the paper: \"My first priority is to come back to my level. Then we'll see what happens. It depends on the situation, but my feeling for Manchester United is great. When I'm physically fit and feeling well, we'll see what happens.\" Bradford will sign Hearts wing-back Gary Locke on a free transfer this week, reports Teamtalk. Birmingham are set to sign Sheffield United's England under-21 midfielder Curtis Woodhouse. The Daily Mail reports that Peter Ndlovu will head in the other direction in a \u00a31.5m player-plus-cash deal. The Sun reports that Chelsea will announce an \u00a318m shirt-sponsorship deal with the Emirates airline tomorrow. Monaco's highly-rated defender Martin Djetou will leave French football in the summer and could move to England. \"I don't like routine and I think it is time for me to go.

The executive was responding to today's revelation that BAT is launching an \"invisible\" drive to promote cigarettes through a disguised website which will drive young consumers to clubs, bars and restaurants selling its brands. He told MediaGuardian.co.uk: \"For many years we have seen advertising for Marlboro Classics clothes and Camel Boots. \"These products boost awareness of their respective cigarette brands but BAT has failed to emulate them. \"BAT has therefore been forced to look at other ways of promoting its brands.\" BAT advertises its top brands - Lucky Strike and State Express 555 - on its forumula one team, British American Racing. However, it has failed to capitalise on the more indirect promotional techniques used by Philip Morris (owner of Marlboro) and RJ Reynolds (owner of Camel). Three years ago, BAT opened a Benson &amp; Hedges-branded cafe in Malaysia. At that time, critics accused the company of trying to link tobacco with \"acceptable\" drugs such as coffee. However, BAT failed to roll out the cafe concept worldwide. The Marlboro brand undoubtedly benefits from a chain of Marlboro Classics men's clothing shops in cities around the world. Marlboro Classics ads - which are still legal - have been criticised for resembling the famous \"Marlboro cowboy\" work used by the cigarette brand. Marlboro and Camel clothing catalogues have also been mailed out to customers responding to tobacco promotions. The government's new anti-tobacco bill, proceeding through the House of Commons, attempts to clamp down on trademark diversification or \"brand stretching\". It also takes the first serious look at regulating the marketing of cigarettes on the internet. BAT this week launched a pilot website in Poland called City Gorilla. The intiative, which is expected to be rolled out worldwide, is ostensibly a guide to nightlife in cities. However, BAT is using the site to drive consumers to outlets that promote its brands.

When specifically they asked Peter to endorse or support any application he refused, perfectly properly and appropriately. He did exactly what any other minister would do, which is pass it to the relevant department, which is the Home Office. Peter did not get involved - beyond being asked to get involved, which he did not.\" </p> <p><b> Tuesday January 23</b><br><b> PM's official spokesman</b> \"Yesterday I repeated that Peter's sole involvement was a call from his private secretary to the Home Office, which was Peter's recollection. Yesterday with offices back up and running, Peter's office was able to look at it in further detail and was able to recollect he had a call with Home Office minister Mike O'Brien in June 1998. </p> <p>\"Mike O'Brien has confirmed Peter Mandelson did not make representations on behalf of the brothers, or make representations on any potential application, and did not support or endorse it.

At no time did I support or endorse this application for citizenship.\" Sunday Jan 21 Spokesman for Northern Ireland Office \"If you ignore the headline of this story and read the facts, Mr Mandelson did not assist in this passport application. He did not support or endorse any application, nor would he have considered doing so.\" Spokesman for Srichand Hinduja \"In the summer of 1998 Mr Hinduja asked Mr Mandelson informally if an application by him to the Home Office for British nationality would be considered. Mr Mandelson kindly came back to Mr Hinduja and confirmed he was eligible to apply, and that a formal application would be considered by the Home Office in the normal manner. Mr Mandelson had absolutely no further involvement.\" Monday January 22 PM's official spokesman \"This was an issue raised by the Hindujas and it was passed to the Home Office. When specifically they asked Peter to endorse or support any application he refused, perfectly properly and appropriately. He did exactly what any other minister would do, which is pass it to the relevant department, which is the Home Office. Peter did not get involved - beyond being asked to get involved, which he did not.\" Tuesday January 23 PM's official spokesman \"Yesterday I repeated that Peter's sole involvement was a call from his private secretary to the Home Office, which was Peter's recollection. Yesterday with offices back up and running, Peter's office was able to look at it in further detail and was able to recollect he had a call with Home Office minister Mike O'Brien in June 1998. \"Mike O'Brien has confirmed Peter Mandelson did not make representations on behalf of the brothers, or make representations on any potential application, and did not support or endorse it. The end result is precisely the same.\" Mr Mandelson \"There was no passport application, no discussion between me and the Home Office of the merits of giving a passport, no support or endorsement by me of any future passport application.

The Advertising Standards Authority has come in for repeated criticism in the past about the length of time it takes to assess complaints about ads. This can enable advertisers to flout the rules because, by the time an ad is banned, the campaign has already run its course. In the time that the ASA took to ban the ads, Red Bull had already dropped the claims that the product improved concentration and endurance in favour of the new line, \"Red Bull gives you wings\". An ASA spokesman said the Red Bull adjudication was exceptional because of the amount of evidence submitted by the manufacturers of the drink to support its claims. The Red Bull Company submitted more than 20 studies to the ASA. \"Unfortunately, this kind of thing does happen from time to time and that is why we are working on speeding up our act,\" said the spokesman. \"But a long investigation is sometimes necessary. You can't just tell someone to stop doing something until it has been investigated properly.\" He said the watchdog had been working on speeding up its adjudication process for several months.

      "byline": "Scott Murray and Sean Ingle",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>THE GREATEST EVER COMEBACK</strong></p> <p><strong>Late one Saturday afternoon in the late Fifties or early Sixties, I was listening to Sports Report on the Light Programme. The big news on that particular day was that a team losing 5-1 had recovered to win 6-5. I'm pretty sure one of the teams was Charlton. Can you tell me who they were playing? I'd also be grateful to know if I've remembered the score correctly</strong> writes Charles Wood.</p> <p>One of the teams was indeed Charlton, Charles. But their Second Division home match against Huddersfield on December 21 1957 was even more incredible than you remember.</p> <p>With only half an hour of the game to play, Huddersfield were 5-1 up and cruising to victory.</p> <p>The scoreline made sense: defensively inept Charlton, who had been relegated the previous season after conceding 120 goals, had been playing with 10 men ever since their captain, Derek Ufton, was stretchered off after 15 minutes with a dislocated shoulder (there were no subs in those days). What followed did not.</p> <p>Charlton's solitary goal at that point had been scored by Johnny Summers. But then the winger really got to work. He scored a second and, a minute later, set one up for John Ryan: 5-3. By the time the next 10 minutes were up, Summers had scored another three, bringing his personal total to a club-record five. Charlton had amazingly taken a 6-5 lead.</p> <p>Huddersfield did rise from their slumber to score an equaliser. But with the last kick of the match, Summers laid on another goal for Ryan and a frankly ridiculous 7-6 victory was complete. </p> <p>No team other than Huddersfield has scored six goals in a league match and still lost. What their manager Bill Shankly said in the dressing room after the game is thankfully not recorded.</p> <p><strong>HOW A DUBIOUS OFFSIDE DECISION SAVED A TACTICAL GENIUS'S LIFE</strong></p> <p><strong>In <a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,398055,00.html\">a previous Knowledge Unlimited</a> we explained how tactical genius Vittorio Pozzo - the man whose metodo formation helped Italy win the World Cup in 1934 and 1938 - was famously warned by Mussolini before the 1938 tournament to \"win or die\".</strong></p> <p>We've had an email from Arild Andersen, adding to the tale. \"Italy won the cup,\" he writes, \"but it could have been over after the first-round match, because the Norway v Italy game sports the most famous offside decision in the history of Norwegian soccer.</p> <p>\"Two minutes left, with the score 1-1, Norwegian left winger Arne Brustad, a Ryan Giggs-like player hailed as the best Scandinavian player of his generation, scored for Norway (he was also the man who levelled the game three minutes earlier). But the referee awarded an extremely dubious offside. This is also confirmed by several Italian sources, and in Norway it's quite popular to consider this a fascist collaboration - the ref was an Austrian.</p> <p>\"The match was broadcast on Norwegian radio, and on the tape a relatively quiet commentator turns into a screaming feedback wizard twice: the equaliser and the offside decision. Italy won the match 2-1 after extra time.\"</p> <p><strong>WHAT COUNTRY WAS SUPPOSED TO HOST THE WORLD CUP IN 1986?</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Can you settle a disagreement that I've started in my local?\"</strong> asks Dan Blandford. <strong>\"I set the questions for the weekly quiz and asked the following question: The 1986 Mexico World Cup was originally meant to be held in which South American country? Let me know your answer as mine was challenged by the rest of the pub!\"</strong></p> <p>In 1974 Fifa awarded the 1986 World Cup to Colombia - but infrastructure and financial problems meant that by 1983 the country was struggling to meet its promises. Realising the prospects of a World Cup in Columbia were slim, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States offered themselves as alternatives for the 1986 tournament.</p> <p>After Colombia were forced to drop out, Brazil decided they weren't interested in World Cup 86 after all. And so Fifa, faced with three competing bids, decided in May 1983 to reject Canada and the US in favour of Mexico.</p> <p>There was much outrage in the US about the decision. Henry Kissinger, the leader of the US bid, even petitioned Fifa for another chance, arguing that the 1986 tournament would revive the fading North American Soccer League (NASL). He was supported by Pele and Franz Beckenbauer - but Fifa's president Joao Havelange was singularly unimpressed.</p> <p>Fifa claimed their decision was down to logistics - the US bid included venues on the east and west coast, which meant increased travelling times and weary footballers. But the real reason was that they wanted to teach US football a lesson.</p> <p>In 1981, Fifa had threatened to outlaw the NASL and suspend the US Federation because the NASL had changed the offside line from halfway to 35 yards out and used a shootout to decide drawn matches. The NASL refused to back down - and even threatened legal action against Fifa. But what comes around goes around, and two years later Fifa got its revenge by rejecting Kissinger's bid. With the last hope of reviving the NASL gone, it folded before the start of the 1986 World Cup. </p> <p>For more information <a href=\"http://roundnotoval.com/henry.html\">click here</a>.</p> <p><strong>NOT REALLY THEIR SUCCESS </strong></p> <p><strong>Can you name an Englishman, Scotsman, Irishman and Welshman that have all played for three sides that have won the European Cup? The players do not have to have been at the club when it was won - eg: Kenny Dalglish has played for two sides in Celtic and Liverpool</strong> writes Russell Herbert.</p> <p>This one reeks of the bonus round in one of Dan Blandford's pub quizzes.

      "bodyText": "THE GREATEST EVER COMEBACK Late one Saturday afternoon in the late Fifties or early Sixties, I was listening to Sports Report on the Light Programme. The big news on that particular day was that a team losing 5-1 had recovered to win 6-5. I'm pretty sure one of the teams was Charlton. Can you tell me who they were playing? I'd also be grateful to know if I've remembered the score correctly writes Charles Wood. One of the teams was indeed Charlton, Charles. But their Second Division home match against Huddersfield on December 21 1957 was even more incredible than you remember. With only half an hour of the game to play, Huddersfield were 5-1 up and cruising to victory. The scoreline made sense: defensively inept Charlton, who had been relegated the previous season after conceding 120 goals, had been playing with 10 men ever since their captain, Derek Ufton, was stretchered off after 15 minutes with a dislocated shoulder (there were no subs in those days). What followed did not. Charlton's solitary goal at that point had been scored by Johnny Summers. But then the winger really got to work. He scored a second and, a minute later, set one up for John Ryan: 5-3. By the time the next 10 minutes were up, Summers had scored another three, bringing his personal total to a club-record five. Charlton had amazingly taken a 6-5 lead. Huddersfield did rise from their slumber to score an equaliser. But with the last kick of the match, Summers laid on another goal for Ryan and a frankly ridiculous 7-6 victory was complete. No team other than Huddersfield has scored six goals in a league match and still lost. What their manager Bill Shankly said in the dressing room after the game is thankfully not recorded. HOW A DUBIOUS OFFSIDE DECISION SAVED A TACTICAL GENIUS'S LIFE In a previous Knowledge Unlimited we explained how tactical genius Vittorio Pozzo - the man whose metodo formation helped Italy win the World Cup in 1934 and 1938 - was famously warned by Mussolini before the 1938 tournament to \"win or die\". We've had an email from Arild Andersen, adding to the tale. \"Italy won the cup,\" he writes, \"but it could have been over after the first-round match, because the Norway v Italy game sports the most famous offside decision in the history of Norwegian soccer. \"Two minutes left, with the score 1-1, Norwegian left winger Arne Brustad, a Ryan Giggs-like player hailed as the best Scandinavian player of his generation, scored for Norway (he was also the man who levelled the game three minutes earlier). But the referee awarded an extremely dubious offside. This is also confirmed by several Italian sources, and in Norway it's quite popular to consider this a fascist collaboration - the ref was an Austrian. \"The match was broadcast on Norwegian radio, and on the tape a relatively quiet commentator turns into a screaming feedback wizard twice: the equaliser and the offside decision. Italy won the match 2-1 after extra time.\" WHAT COUNTRY WAS SUPPOSED TO HOST THE WORLD CUP IN 1986? \"Can you settle a disagreement that I've started in my local?\" asks Dan Blandford. \"I set the questions for the weekly quiz and asked the following question: The 1986 Mexico World Cup was originally meant to be held in which South American country? Let me know your answer as mine was challenged by the rest of the pub!\" In 1974 Fifa awarded the 1986 World Cup to Colombia - but infrastructure and financial problems meant that by 1983 the country was struggling to meet its promises. Realising the prospects of a World Cup in Columbia were slim, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States offered themselves as alternatives for the 1986 tournament. After Colombia were forced to drop out, Brazil decided they weren't interested in World Cup 86 after all. And so Fifa, faced with three competing bids, decided in May 1983 to reject Canada and the US in favour of Mexico. There was much outrage in the US about the decision. Henry Kissinger, the leader of the US bid, even petitioned Fifa for another chance, arguing that the 1986 tournament would revive the fading North American Soccer League (NASL). He was supported by Pele and Franz Beckenbauer - but Fifa's president Joao Havelange was singularly unimpressed. Fifa claimed their decision was down to logistics - the US bid included venues on the east and west coast, which meant increased travelling times and weary footballers. But the real reason was that they wanted to teach US football a lesson. In 1981, Fifa had threatened to outlaw the NASL and suspend the US Federation because the NASL had changed the offside line from halfway to 35 yards out and used a shootout to decide drawn matches. The NASL refused to back down - and even threatened legal action against Fifa. But what comes around goes around, and two years later Fifa got its revenge by rejecting Kissinger's bid. With the last hope of reviving the NASL gone, it folded before the start of the 1986 World Cup. For more information click here. NOT REALLY THEIR SUCCESS Can you name an Englishman, Scotsman, Irishman and Welshman that have all played for three sides that have won the European Cup? The players do not have to have been at the club when it was won - eg: Kenny Dalglish has played for two sides in Celtic and Liverpool writes Russell Herbert. This one reeks of the bonus round in one of Dan Blandford's pub quizzes. Nevertheless, here we go. Your Englishman is Stan Collymore, who made friends at Nottingham Forest (winners in 1979 and 1980), Liverpool (1977, 1978, 1981, 1984) and Aston Villa (1982). Mark Hughes is your Welshman. He's turned out for Manchester United (1968 and 1999), Barcelona (1992) and Bayern Munich (1974, 1975, 1976). The Scottish member of this clan is Alan McInally, who played for Celtic, Villa and Bayern, while Tony Cascarino completes your set, having pulled shots wide of goal at Villa, Celtic and Marseille (1993). There are probably more. But that's enough, isn't it? Oh, alright. David Platt's played for four European Cup winning clubs in United, Villa, Juventus (1985 and 1996) and Forest. Although obviously, like the all the other players we've mentioned, he never actually got his hands on the damn thing. BROTHERS IN GOALS \"When was the last time that two brothers scored in the same match, either in the same team or opposite?\" asks Derek Tonkin. The last brothers to score in the same game for England were the Charltons, with Bobby and Jack both hitting the back of the net during England's 5-1 victory against Wales in November 1966. We're not sure the last time two brothers scored in the same league game, however. If anyone can help (did you see the Wallace brothers manage it?) write in and let us know. YET MORE SPINAL TAP We've had Derek Smalls wearing an early 80s Shrewsbury Town shirt. Smalls sporting a claret and blue baseball cap. David St Hubbins with a Wolves scarf. But the Tap footballing references still pour in. \"At the risk of flogging a dead horse,\" says Sam Johnstone. \"I came across another footie reference in Spinal Tap. \"In the excellent companion book by Karl French there is an out-take showing David St Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel on top of a skyscraper discussing how they are 'top of the world' and comparing the Tap's current form to that of Kenny Dalglish. \"Obviously they were kidding themselves as King Kenny was, at the time of the film, by far the best player in Europe. Whereas the Tap were in Kerry Dixon's league.\" CAN YOU HELP? \"Can you tell me who scored the last First Division goal of the 1991/92 season?\" asks Sue Neil. \"Which club did the Egyptian goalkeeper Mustafa Mansour play for which between 1937 and 1940?\" asks John Boyack. \"I believe the club was a Scottish one but I'm not sure,\" he adds. \"My team in Norway, Odd BK, won the Cup last season; their first trophy since 1931. What is the longest gap between two domestic titles for a European club?\" asks Arild Andersen. Send your answers to the.boss@theguardian.com.",

While the former dome minister took time to remember phoning Mr O'Brien about a passport application from a businessman who was to fund the faith zone, Mr O'Brien could supply the details: it was a two minute call and no pressure was applied. The Home Office was unable to find the note of the June, 1998, conversation yesterday, maintaining the missing record was a cock-up and not a conspiracy to protect the pair. But Mr Mandelson, one of Tony Blair's closest political allies, is likely to be disappointed if he hopes that his admission will be the end of the matter as oppostion MPs demanded precise details of the call. The Hindujas, on bail in India where corruption charges have been filed against them over alleged kickbacks from an arms deal, disclosed they were willing to pump cash into the dome on June 17. Mr Mandelson's enemies demanded to know whether the potentially explosive call was made before or after that date. The admission that he even spoke to Mr O'Brien, then responsible for immigration issues, followed a series of twists and turns by the Northern Ireland secretary and Downing Street that left Labour's Millbank HQ struggling yesterday to persuade Labour MPs publicly to defend the embattled minister. Mr Mandelson has been unable to recall events in the past, most notably in December 1998 when he failed to recall whether or not (he did not) mention a \u00a3373,000 loan from Geoffrey Robinson on his Britannia building society mortgage application form. That crisis ended in Mr Mandelson's resignation from the cabinet and the current furore is seen as another hangover from 1998, the year he lived dangerously. The Hindjuas are Britain's wealthiest Asian family. Srichand and Gopichand hold British passports, while a third brother, Prakash, is a Swiss national. After giving the Tories \u00a36m, they have been courted by New Labour. Mr Mandelson attended a reception in Carlton House Terrace, near Robin Cook's official residence, shortly before the 1997 election while a year ago Tony and Cherie Blair attended a Diwali party in Alexandra Palace hosted by the brothers. Srichand Hinduja approached Mr Mandelson after a passport application had been rejected, asking according to both whether he could take advantage of a change in immigration laws encouraging long term residents to apply. The family had told the New Millennium Experience Company in February 1997, before Labour came to power, it was interested in financing the faith zone, and 12 months later offered to underwrite the entire cost. June 1998 saw them announce to religious groups they would stump up as much as \u00a33m before it emerged in the national press on October 14 that year they would hand over \u00a31m. Six days later Srichand reapplied and by March 1999 he had his passport. Mr Mandelson maintains that he acted properly after he was approached by Srichand for advice but the information has had to be dragged out of Whitehall. The Home Office minister, Barbara Roche, admitted in a parliamentary written reply last Thursday to terrier-like Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker that Mr Mandelson, Keith Vaz - now Europe minister - and \"others\" had \"made inquiries\" but \"did not make representations that an application be granted\". On Saturday night, Mr Mandelson's office issued a statement to the Observer, which carried the story on Sunday, saying: \"To the limited extent that I was involved, I was always very sensitive to the proprieties.

Then in a u-turn yesterday Downing Street admitted that it had not told the truth when Alastair Campbell confessed he had made a mistake. Insisting it was an error, he said the full facts were not known until later Monday when civil servants dug out a record that the call was made. \"With offices back up and running after the weekend,\" said yesterday's No 10 note, \"Mr Mandelson's office had been able to look at the records in full and had discovered that he had had a very brief telephone conversation in June 1998 with Mike O'Brien [the then immigration minister] which had been set up by their two private offices. \"Although Mr Mandelson had no recollection of the call, clearly it had taken place and he had therefore asked him [the PMOS] to make that clarification here and now.

A conservative, teetotal vegetarian, Srichand Hinduja would prefer to be associated with his spiritual and philanthropic concerns. He has written a book, the Essence of Vedic Marriage for Success and Happiness (1996). He is a practising Hindu. (Bathing in the Ganges left one \"energised,\" he said last week.) By billionaire standards, he lives modestly. \"Within the Asian community the Hindujas have a reputation as spiritual leaders,\" a source said last night. \"It is only outside it they are regarded as tycoons.\" Related articles 24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble 24.01.2001: Minister's year of living dangerously Timeline of the passport row 24.01.2001: Profile of Srichand Hinduja 21.01.2001: Mandelson helped Dome backer's bid for passport Cartoon Steve Bell on the passport row Extracts from Andrew Rawnsley's Servants of the People Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party Talk about it What do you think?

Many who stay at home now prefer to eat out instead of cooking the traditional New Year's Eve meal at home; a Shanghai Daily survey showed that the city's top restaurants were fully booked yesterday evening - and some were already taking bookings for next year. Many places offer take-away services - unthinkable in the past when families took pride in preparing their own food. For millions of peasant migrants, however, the spring festival is celebrated with more traditional economy; it is the only chance during the year for most of them to return home to their families. Small groups of rural workers with bundles of belongings are a frequent sight in Shanghai as they make their way through the streets to its railway and bus stations.

      "bodyText": "The father of the murdered schoolboy Damilola Taylor today called for a moral regeneration of Britain in memory of his 10-year-old son. Richard Taylor said he was deeply hurt by the wall of silence which was surrounding Damilola's fatal stabbing in Peckham, south-east London, as he returned home from an after-school computer class last November. Meanwhile, Damilola's mother, Gloria Taylor, has described how blood poured from her son's mouth as she embraced his body hours after his death. Damilola's family renewed their appeal for information today following a statement from detectives earlier this week that the hunt for those responsible could be over in a matter of days if a vital witness came forward. Mr Taylor blamed a lack of family values and moral discipline for the attack and for a subsequent \"culture of hostility\" which police say is preventing them from arresting the killers. He said that moral values had broken down in the UK and, while the public had been \"very kind\" after Damilola's death, he regretted bringing his family to this country. Mr Taylor said the community in Peckham was scared of giving evidence to the police, fearing reprisals from \"the gangs that terrorise the area\". He said: \"I am very much disappointed by this reaction from the community. I know very well that they do have information on who has carried out this heinous act. \"The parents are irresponsible people, they don't have family values and its because of this that they don't have control over their kids.\" Mr Taylor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people who withheld information were also \"criminals\". He added: \"People of Nigeria are shocked that a civilised country like the UK still has things like this happening. \"We have violent acts going on in Nigeria but not the killing of a young boy like Damilola ... who was hacked down by children of no value.\" In a television interview to be shown tonight, Ms Taylor wept as she spoke publicly about her ordeal for the first time since his funeral last week. \"They took me from that spot to the hospital, just about reaching the hospital as they broke the news that he was already dead ... and I couldn't believe it was him,\" she tells BBC1's Crimewatch UK programme. \"Then I pulled him, I pulled him and I put my head on him ... and all that came out from his lips was blood ... splashed over his face and just like a dream to me.\" Mr Taylor added: \"I can't imagine my son dying there, his blood was there. It was a horrifying experience for me.\" The programme features a reconstruction of Damilola's last-known movements built up from CCTV footage. Fifteen people have so far been arrested in connection with the youngster's death on November 27 last year but no one has been charged. Damilola had only been in Britain for four months, after the family had moved from Nigeria to join Mr Taylor. Mr Taylor said a campaign in memory of Damilola would focus on deprived areas such as Peckham. He called on the government to make \"drastic changes\" in policy to foster \"moral values and family values\" especially regarding children carrying dangerous weapons. He said: \"Parents are supposed to know that they don't have to rely on the government to bring up their children, it's their responsibility and it's on this that we are going to campaign.\" \u0095 Crimewatch UK is screened on BBC1 tonight at 9.05pm.

Mr Pollard accused ITN of \"spitting out the dummy\" when it made intemperate remarks about Sky's challenge for the \u00a342m-a-year contract. Mr Pollard, a former ITN executive, made his comment following the announcement that a coalition comprising Sky, CBS, Ulster TV, Chrysalis and Bloomberg was to bid for ITV news contract. An ITN spokesman said: \"We understand the ITC wrote to Sky late last year confirming Sky News was unsuitable to make a solo bid for ITV news because of Rupert Murdoch's large stake in the company. \"Sky has had to construct this coalition to technically dilute Murdoch's influence - but he's still there.\" The spokesman also claimed Sky News was under pressure to win external contracts to justify its existence. Despite growing prestige, Sky News has failed to make a profit in its 12 years of existence. It has bid several times for terrestrial news contracts on ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. Last year, Sky believed it had come close to winning the contract to provide Channel 5 News. At the time, Mr Pollard claimed Sky's bid had beaten a rival bid from ITN.

Without a ratings leg-up from Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, News at Ten slumped by more than 2m down from from 8.1m to 5.9m, according to unofficial overnights. By contrast BBC's Ten O'Clock News held steady at 4.4m, slightly up on Monday night's 4.3m audience. The ratings gap between the two bulletins narrowed from 3.8m two nights ago to 1.5m, still giving News at Ten a comfortable victory. News at Ten inherited 8.8m viewers from Peak Practice at 10pm, compared with 12.8m the previous night from Millionaire. Overall, the Peak District GP drama had 8.4m and a 34% share, over 60 minutes from 9pm. It was up against the concluding part of BBC1 two-part detective drama Second Sight, which shed 1m viewers between episodes, despite the backing of a newspaper ad campaign marketing the Monday and Tuesday night slots under a \"Crime Double\" drama banner. The Clive Owen vehicle managed just 4.4m and an 18% share, which is believed to be one of the worst performances for a BBC1 first-run weekday drama in the past decade. The real ratings winner last night was Channel 5 movie repeat The Rock, which aired between 9pm and 11.40pm. The action thriller, which features Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery battling renegade US soldiers on Alcatraz, pulled in 3.4m and an 18% share. BBC2 also enjoyed success at 9pm, with a documentary looking back 10 years to the Challenger space shuttle disaster. Challenger had 3.4m and a 14% share. At 10pm Channel 4 had Better Sex, a documentary series focusing on the work of Relate's psychosexual therapy service. The show drew 1.9m and an 11% share.",

The recently paroled star married model-actress Deborah Falconer in 1992 but separated from her five years ago. In the suit, Falconer cites irreconcilable differences and seeks sole custody of the couple's seven-year-old son Indio. Next week Downey Jr will be back in court facing further drug charges that could land him straight back in prison. \u0095 Courtney Love has filed charges against Lesley Barber, the former wife of current boyfriend Jim Barber. The Hole frontwoman and star of Man on the Moon claims that Ms Barber harassed her with physical threats and prank phone calls. Matters reached a head, claims Love, when Barber drove a car over her foot, causing injuries that allegedly caused her to withdraw from the John Carpenter film Ghosts of Mars. Love's attorney Martin Singer is seeking damages, medical bills and loss of earnings estimated at $1.5m (\u00a31m). \u0095 Rumours are currently swirling around Hollywood of a possible break-up between Courteney Cox and husband David Arquette. Supposedly outraged by Arquette's partying ways, Cox is said to have thrown him out of the house and is now demanding a divorce. The couple met while filming the Scream series and wed 18 months ago.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This afternoon, trains permitting, I shall be in Somerset attending the funeral of a man who was vilified in this newspaper last week as \"effete, drunken, snobbish, sneering, racist and sexist\". Auberon Waugh would have been delighted to learn that even in death he could still get a rise out of po-faced liberals. </p> <p>And he would have loved the letter published the following day: \"My immediate reaction on hearing of Waugh's death was to punch the air and exclaim, 'Good riddance!'\" The letter-writer congratulated Polly Toynbee for putting into words \"exactly how I really felt about this vile man\". </p> <p>Blimey. You'd hardly guess that the subject of this hysterical denunciation was the editor of a small-circulation literary magazine, a minor novelist and a humorous journalist. If that's how Guardian readers and pundits react to the death of such a figure, what on earth will they do when General Pinochet pegs out? </p> <p>The anti-Waugh broadsides are at least a useful antidote to some of the extravagant obituarising elsewhere, which portrayed the old boy as a towering genius and latter-day saint. But I still find them puzzling. In the introduction to his Private Eye diaries, undoubtedly his best work, Waugh warned that \"the material is entirely jocular: it contains no serious allegations whatever and everything in it is untrue\". </p> <p>His diaries, like those of Charles Pooter or Adrian Mole, are a comic novel. Some find it funny; some don't. Humour, it should be unnecessary to point out, is in the beholder's eye. I know people who hate Fawlty Towers, which is regarded by many others as the most hilarious sitcom of all time. But even readers who find the Diary of a Nobody wholly unamusing don't call down curses on the corpses of George and Weedon Grossmith. Why break a gadfly upon a wheel? </p> <p>Ah, says Toynbee, but Waugh was not a lone and harmless irritant. He belonged to a \"coterie\", a sinister conspiracy of irreverent troublemakers who \"spit poison at anyone vulgar enough to want to improve anything\". (There is a distant echo here of Waugh's own comment many years ago about Princess Anne, \"whose poisonous spittle could stop a camel in its tracks at 20 paces and blind a press photographer for life at twice the distance\".) </p> <p>It is quite true that Waugh mistrusted most schemes of \"improvement\" proposed by smooth-talking politicians on the make. He had this in common, I'd guess, with the majority of the population. He mistrusted power in all its manifestations: McDonald's and the Murdoch empire were regular targets. </p> <p>If Waugh was a racist, how does one explain his passionate crusade on behalf of the Biafrans? The correct position for a racist reactionary Englishman would have been to argue that it was none of our concern if one group of Africans wished to massacre another. </p> <p>If he was a caricature sexist, why did his \"coterie\" at Literary Review consist largely of women, many of them leftwing, vegetarian feminists? Why was he one of the earliest champions of Angela Carter? And, if he really was a poisonous bigot, why did he enjoy the enduring friendship of Paul Foot and other lifelong leftwingers? </p> <p>The answer to all these questions is that Waugh was a genial and generous soul. I first discovered this when, as a 17-year-old reader of his fiction reviews, I wrote to ask for help. Having been \"educated\" at a philistine school, I had read almost no books at all; yet I had somehow conned my way into university to study English literature. </p> <p>Could he recommend a crash course in the basic texts? The reply came by return of post. \"I don't for a moment believe that you are a 17-year-old schoolboy,\" he wrote, clearly suspecting a practical joke. \"Nevertheless, just in case you are ...\" There then followed several hand-written pages of detailed and extremely helpful suggestions. </p> <p>A little later, at university, I had to write an essay on \"the literary influences on Evelyn Waugh\". After several drinks in the student union bar one night, I obtained Bron's number from directory enquiries and rang to ask what authors his father admired. Not at all cross at having his evening interrupted by an unknown student in a phone-box, he spoke at some length about Evelyn Waugh's love of Thomas Love Peacock and Ronald Firbank. I duly put it all in my essay, citing an \"interview with Auberon Waugh\" as the source (and was severely marked down by my tutor, who scribbled \"this is mere journalism\" in the margin). </p> <p>Bron Waugh was no saint, but someone capable of such kindness to an importunate young stranger was no ogre either. The monstrous persona he created for himself in the Private Eye diaries was a fictional character, invented to entertain and provoke. Not everyone laughed; but the provocation clearly worked, at least on the more cloth-eared members of the audience. Little do they realise, as they yell their insults at his unheeding coffin, that the joke's on them. </p> <p><strong>Oddballs, deadbeats and MI6 recruits</strong></p> <p>When Auberon Waugh was kicked out of Oxford university, his father advised that there were only two possible careers for him: \"You must become either a schoolmaster or a spy.\" But young Waugh's application to join British Intelligence was sabotaged by one of the people he had cited as a referee, who told MI6 that \"I wouldn't even employ Auberon Waugh as my butler\". </p> <p>The only surprise is that the spooks didn't hire him forthwith. Their recruitment system has always been pretty eccentric, letting in scores of deadbeats and oddballs and outright fantasists - including Richard Tomlinson, who has been described by his acquaintance David Shayler as a consummate bullshit-artist. </p> <p>In an extract from his book which has already been published, and can therefore be mentioned with impunity, Tomlinson describes MI6's training procedure. He and other apprentices were dropped in the centre of Portsmouth and given an hour in which to obtain the name, address and passport number of any member of the public. </p> <p>Tomlinson did it by chatting up two young women in a pub and asking if they'd like to join his crew for a sailing trip to France the following weekend. They duly wrote down all their personal details: mission accomplished. Another trainee, \"Spencer\", failed to return to base, having got hopelessly drunk and forgotten about his assignment. </p> <p>Thus do the James Bonds of tomorrow prove themselves. But of course there's more to it than that. Thanks to the rightwing historian Andrew Roberts, a contemporary of Tomlinson at Cambridge University, we know that applicants must also sit \"a series of extremely testing exams\". </p> <p>As Roberts revealed a couple of years ago, \"some were straightforward: my spirits rose when I was asked to place, in order of precedence, viscount, duke, marquess, earl and baron.\" Having sailed through this test, Roberts was summoned for an interview with the MI6 doctor, who got straight down to business: \"Homosexual, are you?\" When Roberts said no, the doctor apologised for being so personal. \"We have to ask. Silly, really, as of course no one says yes.

      "bodyText": "This afternoon, trains permitting, I shall be in Somerset attending the funeral of a man who was vilified in this newspaper last week as \"effete, drunken, snobbish, sneering, racist and sexist\". Auberon Waugh would have been delighted to learn that even in death he could still get a rise out of po-faced liberals. And he would have loved the letter published the following day: \"My immediate reaction on hearing of Waugh's death was to punch the air and exclaim, 'Good riddance!'\" The letter-writer congratulated Polly Toynbee for putting into words \"exactly how I really felt about this vile man\". Blimey. You'd hardly guess that the subject of this hysterical denunciation was the editor of a small-circulation literary magazine, a minor novelist and a humorous journalist. If that's how Guardian readers and pundits react to the death of such a figure, what on earth will they do when General Pinochet pegs out? The anti-Waugh broadsides are at least a useful antidote to some of the extravagant obituarising elsewhere, which portrayed the old boy as a towering genius and latter-day saint. But I still find them puzzling. In the introduction to his Private Eye diaries, undoubtedly his best work, Waugh warned that \"the material is entirely jocular: it contains no serious allegations whatever and everything in it is untrue\". His diaries, like those of Charles Pooter or Adrian Mole, are a comic novel. Some find it funny; some don't. Humour, it should be unnecessary to point out, is in the beholder's eye. I know people who hate Fawlty Towers, which is regarded by many others as the most hilarious sitcom of all time. But even readers who find the Diary of a Nobody wholly unamusing don't call down curses on the corpses of George and Weedon Grossmith. Why break a gadfly upon a wheel? Ah, says Toynbee, but Waugh was not a lone and harmless irritant. He belonged to a \"coterie\", a sinister conspiracy of irreverent troublemakers who \"spit poison at anyone vulgar enough to want to improve anything\". (There is a distant echo here of Waugh's own comment many years ago about Princess Anne, \"whose poisonous spittle could stop a camel in its tracks at 20 paces and blind a press photographer for life at twice the distance\".) It is quite true that Waugh mistrusted most schemes of \"improvement\" proposed by smooth-talking politicians on the make. He had this in common, I'd guess, with the majority of the population. He mistrusted power in all its manifestations: McDonald's and the Murdoch empire were regular targets. If Waugh was a racist, how does one explain his passionate crusade on behalf of the Biafrans? The correct position for a racist reactionary Englishman would have been to argue that it was none of our concern if one group of Africans wished to massacre another. If he was a caricature sexist, why did his \"coterie\" at Literary Review consist largely of women, many of them leftwing, vegetarian feminists? Why was he one of the earliest champions of Angela Carter? And, if he really was a poisonous bigot, why did he enjoy the enduring friendship of Paul Foot and other lifelong leftwingers? The answer to all these questions is that Waugh was a genial and generous soul. I first discovered this when, as a 17-year-old reader of his fiction reviews, I wrote to ask for help. Having been \"educated\" at a philistine school, I had read almost no books at all; yet I had somehow conned my way into university to study English literature. Could he recommend a crash course in the basic texts? The reply came by return of post. \"I don't for a moment believe that you are a 17-year-old schoolboy,\" he wrote, clearly suspecting a practical joke. \"Nevertheless, just in case you are ...\" There then followed several hand-written pages of detailed and extremely helpful suggestions. A little later, at university, I had to write an essay on \"the literary influences on Evelyn Waugh\". After several drinks in the student union bar one night, I obtained Bron's number from directory enquiries and rang to ask what authors his father admired. Not at all cross at having his evening interrupted by an unknown student in a phone-box, he spoke at some length about Evelyn Waugh's love of Thomas Love Peacock and Ronald Firbank. I duly put it all in my essay, citing an \"interview with Auberon Waugh\" as the source (and was severely marked down by my tutor, who scribbled \"this is mere journalism\" in the margin). Bron Waugh was no saint, but someone capable of such kindness to an importunate young stranger was no ogre either. The monstrous persona he created for himself in the Private Eye diaries was a fictional character, invented to entertain and provoke. Not everyone laughed; but the provocation clearly worked, at least on the more cloth-eared members of the audience. Little do they realise, as they yell their insults at his unheeding coffin, that the joke's on them. Oddballs, deadbeats and MI6 recruits When Auberon Waugh was kicked out of Oxford university, his father advised that there were only two possible careers for him: \"You must become either a schoolmaster or a spy.\" But young Waugh's application to join British Intelligence was sabotaged by one of the people he had cited as a referee, who told MI6 that \"I wouldn't even employ Auberon Waugh as my butler\". The only surprise is that the spooks didn't hire him forthwith. Their recruitment system has always been pretty eccentric, letting in scores of deadbeats and oddballs and outright fantasists - including Richard Tomlinson, who has been described by his acquaintance David Shayler as a consummate bullshit-artist. In an extract from his book which has already been published, and can therefore be mentioned with impunity, Tomlinson describes MI6's training procedure. He and other apprentices were dropped in the centre of Portsmouth and given an hour in which to obtain the name, address and passport number of any member of the public. Tomlinson did it by chatting up two young women in a pub and asking if they'd like to join his crew for a sailing trip to France the following weekend. They duly wrote down all their personal details: mission accomplished. Another trainee, \"Spencer\", failed to return to base, having got hopelessly drunk and forgotten about his assignment. Thus do the James Bonds of tomorrow prove themselves. But of course there's more to it than that. Thanks to the rightwing historian Andrew Roberts, a contemporary of Tomlinson at Cambridge University, we know that applicants must also sit \"a series of extremely testing exams\". As Roberts revealed a couple of years ago, \"some were straightforward: my spirits rose when I was asked to place, in order of precedence, viscount, duke, marquess, earl and baron.\" Having sailed through this test, Roberts was summoned for an interview with the MI6 doctor, who got straight down to business: \"Homosexual, are you?\" When Roberts said no, the doctor apologised for being so personal. \"We have to ask. Silly, really, as of course no one says yes. With Oxford it's drugs, with Cambridge it's boys.\" What it is with Leicester or Nottingham we shall never know, since the procedures are clearly designed to weed out provincial oiks and favour bumptious chaps who can spot a marquess at a hundred paces. According to Roberts, it is not the fault of MI6 that Tomlinson \"went progressively pottier\" after leaving university, succumbing to Walter Mitty fantasies and boasting of his escapades behind enemy lines in Bosnia. Yet Roberts admits that MI6 \"never discovered Richard's drug-taking habits, his promiscuity or his late-night clubbing forays around London on his motorbike; they gave him an almost unprecedented fourth year of probation\". If MI6 can't be blamed for failing to notice Tomlinson's antics, who can? This, I imagine, is why the spooks have been so desperate to prevent Tomlinson from blabbing. His book is unlikely to tell \"our enemies\" anything they didn't know already - but by God it might frighten the British taxpayers who have to finance this absurd circus.",

      "body": "<p>The new network of \"public health observatories\", billed as an independent voice on health and inequality, has flexed its muscles for the first time and forced the release of official data. </p> <p>The government-funded network, which operates in each of the eight NHS regions in England, was set up with ministerial approval last year. Observatories will provide the public with an accurate picture of the health and well-being of their area, flag up inequalities, provide early warning of potential problems and draw together information on new ways to improve health. </p> <p>Alison Hill, who chairs the Association of Public Health Observatories and is director of the south-west observatory, has disclosed that the Office for National Statistics was refusing to hand over detailed birth and death data, citing commercial confidentiality. \"This is a wonderful data set that is available to everyone in the NHS,\" she says. \"It's a database of public health information that is not available to the general public because they [the ONS] told us that if they made it available, they would lose a lot of revenue. We went back to the chief medical officer to explain how we wanted to make this information freely available to the public. The CMO contacted them and asked them to release it. This is only information that has come from the public in the first place in terms of data about births and deaths. The public do have a right to this sort of information.\" </p> <p>Hill guarantees that the data - which is anonymous for data protection purposes - will be available to the public. \"It will be going on to our observatory websites and we are trying to think of other ways of dissemination. It's data at local authority level at the moment, but we want to get it down to electoral ward level because that is just the kind of thing people need to know.\" </p> <p>There has been criticism that the observatories will duplicate the work of local health authorities, local government and universities. But advocates of the network counter that it is filling a gap created by the demise of the regional health authorities in 1994. </p> <p>Mark Bellis, director of the north-west observatory, describes the network as a child of the information revolution. He believes that access to information will drive a 21st century public health revolution, just as sewer engineering drove the sanitation revolution of the 19th century. \"It shouldn't be inferred that we are reinventing the wheel,\" he says. \"There is an awful lot of information out there, but it's not exploited in the way that it should be at the moment.\" </p> <p>Bellis is coordinator of a project to map the sexual health of teenagers across England. His observatory is attempting to plot levels of class A drug use and it is providing health information to private companies, local authorities, fire, police and the judiciary. \"We can do health impact assessments for new firms if they want to build a new office or factory,\" he says. \"We will help minimise pollution and disruption and tell them what they can and can't do. But we also want to maximise jobs and community benefits because, as we know, there are health gains from these sorts of things.\" </p> <p>In London, meanwhile, observatory director Bobbie Jacobson aims to set up an ethnic minority health surveillance unit to end what she calls \"the disgrace of ignorance\" about progress on ethnic minority health issues across the capital.</p>",

We went back to the chief medical officer to explain how we wanted to make this information freely available to the public. The CMO contacted them and asked them to release it. This is only information that has come from the public in the first place in terms of data about births and deaths. The public do have a right to this sort of information.\" Hill guarantees that the data - which is anonymous for data protection purposes - will be available to the public. \"It will be going on to our observatory websites and we are trying to think of other ways of dissemination. It's data at local authority level at the moment, but we want to get it down to electoral ward level because that is just the kind of thing people need to know.\" There has been criticism that the observatories will duplicate the work of local health authorities, local government and universities. But advocates of the network counter that it is filling a gap created by the demise of the regional health authorities in 1994. Mark Bellis, director of the north-west observatory, describes the network as a child of the information revolution. He believes that access to information will drive a 21st century public health revolution, just as sewer engineering drove the sanitation revolution of the 19th century. \"It shouldn't be inferred that we are reinventing the wheel,\" he says. \"There is an awful lot of information out there, but it's not exploited in the way that it should be at the moment.\" Bellis is coordinator of a project to map the sexual health of teenagers across England. His observatory is attempting to plot levels of class A drug use and it is providing health information to private companies, local authorities, fire, police and the judiciary. \"We can do health impact assessments for new firms if they want to build a new office or factory,\" he says. \"We will help minimise pollution and disruption and tell them what they can and can't do. But we also want to maximise jobs and community benefits because, as we know, there are health gains from these sorts of things.\" In London, meanwhile, observatory director Bobbie Jacobson aims to set up an ethnic minority health surveillance unit to end what she calls \"the disgrace of ignorance\" about progress on ethnic minority health issues across the capital.",

But a spokesman for the Department of Health said a new mandatory system was being set up for reporting adverse events and \"near misses\", including wrongly administered spinal injections. \"The aim is to ensure that no more patients die or are paralysed by maladministered spinal injections. New protective measures are due to be in place by the end of this year, he said.\" A spokesman for Queen's medical centre apologised to the family, adding: \"A full inquiry has been started to discover what went wrong.\"",

It has also made an application to industry regulators for the necessary \"nominated news provider\" status providing certain guarantees on the quality and resources of the proposed service. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch has long envied ITN's monopoly in the free to air commercial market. BSkyB made a bid to win the last ITV contract in 1996, and more recently failed to edge ITN out of the picture at both Channel 4 and Channel 5. </p> <p>A spokesman for the consortium said it was \"committed to developing a proposal for ITV based on the principles of high quality journalism.\" </p> <p>Sky News, BSkyB's award-winning 24-hour news channel, has been running for the past 11 years.

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB yesterday announced the formation of a powerful consortium of companies to oust ITN from the \u00a3200m contract to supply news to ITV. The alliance includes US network CBS, financial news group Bloomberg, Chrysalis and Ulster TV - each of which will have a 20% stake in the company making the bid for the next contract. The consortium has already fired its first salvo in a letter to the ITV Network outlining its plans. It has also made an application to industry regulators for the necessary \"nominated news provider\" status providing certain guarantees on the quality and resources of the proposed service. Mr Murdoch has long envied ITN's monopoly in the free to air commercial market. BSkyB made a bid to win the last ITV contract in 1996, and more recently failed to edge ITN out of the picture at both Channel 4 and Channel 5. A spokesman for the consortium said it was \"committed to developing a proposal for ITV based on the principles of high quality journalism.\" Sky News, BSkyB's award-winning 24-hour news channel, has been running for the past 11 years. CBS is the home of legendary newsman Walter Cronkite, and produces shows including Sixty Minutes. An ITN spokesman belittled the consortium and set the tone for what is likely to be a bitter contest. \"Sky has been touting around for potential partners for months,\" he said. \"After all their efforts, they've ended up with two tiny UK broadcasters and two cost cutting American players. It's a ragbag partnership crafted from desperation. \"It is ironic that this coalition should be announced on the day that ITN beat the BBC news by a margin of two to one in the battle of the 10pm bulletins. That's not great timing on Sky's part.\" The ITV bulletin returned after an absence of nearly two years with 8.1m viewers on Monday night, while BBC1's Ten O'Clock News drew an audience of some 4.3m. BSkyB and its partners in the consortium may find it difficult to break the long relationship between ITV and ITN, which stretches back to the network's launch in 1955. An extension of Mr Murdoch's influence in British media will also have its opponents. The existing five year contract to supply news to ITV - worth about \u00a340m a year to ITN - comes up for renewal at the end of 2002. Shareholders in ITN have recently been pressing for an early renewal of the contract. The five shareholders in ITN, Carlton Communica tions, Granada Media, Reuters, United Business Media and Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, had been keen to put a new contract in place ahead of a potential stock market flotation of the business. The ITV contract accounts for about 45% of ITN's revenues. A spokeswoman for ITV said the network would take an impartial view of awarding the next contract. \u0095 ITN and billboard advertising group Maiden Outdoor are combining to show news and advertising on five- by three-metre screens at rail stations.",

Lord Irvine said he would await expressions of interest from TV companies and consult the judiciary about running closed pilot schemes. The cameras would be allowed to cover only \"appellant\" cases, judicial reviews or cases involving legal argument between lawyers and judges in which no witnesses or juries were required. Janet Paraskeva, chief executive of the Law Society, welcomed the proposal as being in the public interest, as long as cases involving witnesses were not included. Giving evidence to the home affairs select committee, Lord Irvine said: \"If I was satisfied that there was a demand and that we could set up pilots, I would discuss it with the higher judiciary, and I would not set my face against it.\" He expressed his \"hostile\" attitude to televised trials since the case of the British au pair Louise Woodward in the US. \"There is a great risk that the behaviour and judgment of lawyers, witnesses and indeed the jury itself might be affected by the knowledge that they were participating in a live media event,\" he told MPs. He admitted that some judges might fear that limited coverage of appellate cases could be the thin end of the wedge, creating an appetite for the televising of trials. Support for an experiment has also come from Lord Williams, the attorney general. The Lord Chancellor's department said pilots would have to be authorised by the court, on terms defined by it, for the purpose of considering whether the public might be better informed about the proceedings.

Meanwhile, reliable sources have revealed that Express Newspapers has failed to keep up to date with its rent payments. Advertising sales staff are believed to have opted for voluntary redundancy, but an insider said: \"It was made clear that they were all to be made redundant anyway.\" Journalists and photographers at the office are also thought to be facing redundancy. Express reporters Paul Gallagher and Eugene Henderson and the Star's John Mahoney are all facing job cuts, as are Express photographer Stuart Mason and freelancer Tony Fisher, a former Star staff snapper who still works regularly for the paper in the north of England. The landlord of the office where the Express rents space also confirmed that Express Newspapers owes rent on the property. The news follows a spate of redundancies in the Express's London headquarters, where around 30 jobs were cut at the end of last year. The 46 staff at Express Digital Media also lost their jobs recently after the sale of the websites to an investment company which promptly put the sites into liquidation. Express Newspapers is facing legal action from staff who are suing for redundancy and unpaid wages. They have the backing of the National Union of Journalists.

He moved to Germany where, he says, he was offered money to give details of alleged MI6 operations in that country. With MI6 lawyers chasing him, he went to Italy and worked in a bar in Rimini.</p> <p>Tomlinson became a nervous wreck and even paranoid.Yesterday he said: \"I have been hounded and hounded.

      "bodyText": "Richard Tomlinson has been evading the clutches of MI6 since he jumped parole in 1998 after serving six months for breaking the Official Secrets Act. He was prosecuted for sending a synopsis of his book to an Australian publisher. The previous year, MI6 gave him \u00a325,000 and a job with the motor racing team owned by former racing driver Jackie Stewart. He says now he was unimpressed with the offer, which he was made to sign \"under duress\" when on the run in Spain. He blames his sacking on an MI6 personnel officer who he calls \"Poison Dwarf\". His bitterness may not have been helped bythe fact that his girlfriend had died of cancer. When he was sacked, he insisted on taking his case to an industrial tribunal. MI6 personnel officers laughed at the suggestion. Since then, the security and intelligence agencies have reluctantly agreed their officers can take grievances to a tribunal so long as genuine secrets are protected. Paranoid After first flying to Paris in 1998, Tomlinson moved to Switzerland, where he was friendly with local police until he was accused of putting details about MI6, including names of officers, on the internet. He moved to Germany where, he says, he was offered money to give details of alleged MI6 operations in that country. With MI6 lawyers chasing him, he went to Italy and worked in a bar in Rimini. Tomlinson became a nervous wreck and even paranoid.Yesterday he said: \"I have been hounded and hounded. They had me put under surveillance by an incompetent Italian detective agency. They told my neighbours in Rimini that I was a convicted paedophile. That made me determined to publish the book. \"They can come and arrest me if they like or just leave me alone.\"",

Beverly Malone, who has been named one of the most influential African-Americans and has a formidable reputation in international nursing circles, is on a shortlist of four for the job of general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing. Interviews for the \u00a390,000-a-year post are taking place today and an appointment is due to be ratified this week by the college's ruling council. But the selection process has already triggered controversy. Some activists within the college are furious that only four candidates are being interviewed and that other strong contenders, including the present assistant general secretary, have been excluded. Ms Malone, who is in her early 50s, is seen as having been invited to apply for the post. She was president of the American Nurses' Association from 1996 until January last year, when she was recruited as deputy assistant secretary at the US health department, advising on policy and programme development. While her American credentials are of the highest calibre, however, many will question her grasp of British health care policy at a time of fundamental change under the government's NHS plan. The vacancy for RCN general secretary - the face of nursing - has been caused by the decision of Christine Hancock, who has held the post for more than 10 years, to quit to devote her time to the presidency of the International Council of Nurses. The college has flourished under Ms Hancock and her predecessor, the late Trevor Clay. Its membership has risen to 325,000 and it recently took a hotly contested, but key, decision to extend associate membership to health care assistants, ensuring further growth. In 1995, the college voted to scrap its no-strike rule - a move which has added enormously to its muscle without, as yet, being acted upon. Appointment of the new general secretary has been delegated to a sub-group of the 25-strong council. It is this group which has decided not to interview all eight candidates identified by a recruitment consultancy as potential appointees. The group initially chose five candidates for interview: Ms Malone; Pippa Bagnall, a nursing consultant and former director of the Queen's Nursing Institute, which promotes community nursing; Mel Chevannes, professor and head of the school of nursing and midwifery at De Montfort University, Leicester, and chair of the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS trust; Alison Kitson, director of the RCN Institute, the college's practice and research arm; and Ron de Witt, a nurse and chief executive of King's Healthcare trust in south London. Mr de Witt is understood to have since withdrawn, leaving an all-women shortlist of four. Left off the shortlist were Tom Bolger, RCN assistant general secretary who is Ms Hancock's deputy; Pippa Gough, head of the college's policy unit; and Jane Salvage, nursing director of media group Emap Healthcare. The exclusions of Mr Bolger and Ms Salvage are causing most unrest among activists. Mr Bolger is highly popular with grassroots members and there are accusations that his past health problems - he is about to undergo a heart operation - are being used as an excuse to sideline him. Ms Salvage is a graduate nurse who has written widely on nursing and has an international reputation. She has, however, been outspokenly critical of aspects of the RCN under Ms Hancock and has backed those calling for change and, in particular, more openness. Of the four remaining candidates, Ms Malone and Ms Kitson are regarded as frontrunners, followed by Prof Chevannes, who like Ms Malone is black, and Ms Bagnall.

      "bodyText": "MI6 set up a surrogate news agency in central London as a front for recruiting Russians to spy for Britain, the rogue British intelligence officer Richard Tomlinson alleges in the controversial book which the service has been trying to ban. In what he describes as a botched and short-lived operation in 1992, the former MI6 officer claims the service wasted almost \u00a340,000 on a futile effort to obtain Russian military secrets. The three-month operation of the Truefax news agency resulted in not a single military secret being obtained and it was closed down, according to extracts from Tomlinson's book, The Big Breach, published in Russia yesterday. A Russian military analyst who Tomlinson said he tried to recruit as an MI6 spy confirmed the existence of Truefax to The Guardian yesterday, disclosing that he had done some work for the phony news agency. Tomlinson says that Truefax was established in Conduit Street in central London by him and a KGB defector in 1992 with a view to cultivating Russian journalists, obtaining military secrets, and recruiting Russian agents. \"This venture did not get us a single secret document and cost $60,000,\" he writes, as translated from the Russian. After failing to publish The Big Breach on Monday as promised, Tomlinson's Moscow publisher, Sergei Korovin, yesterday told The Guardian the book, the subject of a High Court injunction obtained by MI6 against the Sunday Times last Friday, would definitely be launched this week, perhaps today. Mr Korovin and Narodny Variant, the publishing company set up solely for the Tomlinson book project, have been leaking snippets to Komsomolskaya Pravda, the best-selling Moscow tabloid, and on to the internet, thus releasing more of its contents in to the public domain and increasing pressure on MI6 and the courts to allow the book to be issued in Britain. Yesterday's disclosures focused on MI6 operations in Moscow around the time of the Soviet collapse in 1991-92. The MI6 Moscow residency, the renegade spy said, was made up of five operatives plus three or four technicians and half a dozen secretaries. In spring 1992 Tomlinson says he was attached to the service's Russia section in London under a man who ordered him to recruit a Russian journalist with access to military secrets. Tomlinson was teamed with Mikhail Butkov, who defected to Britain from the KGB in Norway in 1991 and had been given a large house outside Reading, Berkshire.

He came to Britain in 1997, and visited Switzerland in 2000 where he met Tomlinson. An MI6 officer, identified only as AH, told the high court last week that he was acting \"on behalf of Russian intelligence\". A former KGB veteran emphasised that his ex-colleagues knew nothing of the Tomlinson book and that the government press ministry which has to licence Russian publishers was also in the dark about Narodny Variant and Mr Korovin. But Oleg Tkach, chief editor of the Olma-Press publishers, told the Kommersant newspaper that no one in Moscow publishing had heard of Narodny Variant. \"Probably it is SVR agents poking around.

      "bodyText": "A jury yesterday found a rubbish collector guilty of handling stolen designer clothes belonging to pop singer Victoria Beckham. Mark Oliver, 20, of Stanwell in west London, was convicted at Isleworth crown court, west London, on two charges of handling stolen goods. A charge of theft was dismissed. On Monday Ms Beckham had told the court that four of her six cases were stolen after she arrived at Heathrow airport from Miami. Oliver told the court he believed the clothes in the cases had been dumped inside bin liners on the back of his rubbish truck. With them were items of sentimental value, and he had contacted the singer via a number available to him, that of her \"nail technician\", Jo. He returned the items -including a baby book with a lock of hair from her child, Brooklyn. The court heard how the singer phoned Oliver to thank him. She said: \"I decided to call - I was just grateful somebody would give them back to me, and secondly, to see if he could get any more of my belongings back. I asked him how he had come into contact with it [her belongings], and he said he owned a dumper truck of some sort and he had found a dustbin bag in the back which he had looked into.\" However, Kim Hollis, prosecuting, said that Oliver failed to return various clothes belonging to the 26-year-old star - label items by Ralph Lauren, Plein Sud and Maria Grachvogel. Mrs Hollis said that during a telephone conversation between Oliver and Mrs Beckham, the defendant had pretended in a \"farcical pantomime\" to search for her possessions on a rubbish tip. Oliver's sister, Sadie, had told the court that she had taken the entertainer's clothes unwittingly when she was looking through bin liners, which she believed were destined for a car boot sale. Sentencing was adjourned for a date to be fixed while reports on Oliver were obtained. Press Association",

Last night the share price edged up 1.5p to 222.5p, well ahead of its 165p year's low but still off its 295p high, prompting speculation it could be a takeover target or even taken private. </p> <p>Mr Hill said the share price was not essential, as the group was not after acquisitions, but he would still like reassurance. Earnings per share have increased 76% to 7.9p, and the proposed interim dividend is up 10% to 0.8p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "SFI Group, the high street bar and restaurant operator, yesterday revealed it was in talks to sell For Your Eyes Only, its chain of table dancing venues. The company, which enjoyed a bumper Christmas period with sales up 111% to \u00a315m, said it was time to sell the chain because it did not fit in with the rest of its business. Tony Hill, the executive chairman, said the chain only contributed a small amount to the group and needed a lot of work to take it forward. Analysts predict that the four venues, which are based in London, Bournemouth and South-hampton, could fetch up to \u00a38m. \"The move should be applauded,\" said Nigel Popham, of Teather &amp; Greenwood. \"There were quite a few people that weren't comfortable and didn't want to invest in the company because of it.\" SFI, whose portfolio includes the Litten Tree and Bar Med brands, delighted the City with pretax profits above most expectations at \u00a36.2m for the 24 weeks to November 18, up from \u00a33.1m last year. The turnover, which increased 91% to \u00a345.3m, was helped by the performance of the Slug &amp; Lettuce and Break for the Border chains, bought last summer for \u00a332m and \u00a34.7m respectively. \"The results and outlook are extremely positive,\" said one analyst. Last night the share price edged up 1.5p to 222.5p, well ahead of its 165p year's low but still off its 295p high, prompting speculation it could be a takeover target or even taken private. Mr Hill said the share price was not essential, as the group was not after acquisitions, but he would still like reassurance. Earnings per share have increased 76% to 7.9p, and the proposed interim dividend is up 10% to 0.8p.",

Losses for ELC were reduced from \u00a36.4m to \u00a35.5m in the six months to November. The news of the proposed sale, part of the company's strategy to dispose of non-core seasonal businesses and to move into aviation and distribution, came as John Menzies reported a half-year loss of \u00a38.2m compared to a profit of \u00a37.8m. This included an exceptional charge of \u00a323.9m re lated to the decision to sell its THE music business to management and close down its THE Games distributor. In its final contribution to the company's results, THE turned in an improved sales performance, up by \u00a341.5m to \u00a371.8m thanks to the Pokemon phenomenon. Menzies is shutting THE Games at the end of next month when its contract with Pokemon owner Nintendo ends. \"THE Games' results were outstanding and the timing of our exit from this business has allowed us to maximise its profits at the peak of the Pokemon phenomenon,\" the company said. Menzies' total turnover rose 6% to \u00a3630.9m, with two-thirds coming from the distribution of magazines and newspapers to shops. The group also said it has moved further into the airport ground handling business. John Menzies acquired Ogden Ground Services at the end of November for $118m (\u00a380.27m), as part of its move into less seasonal businesses. Analysts yesterday said the results were in line with expectations. One said: \"John Menzies should be a more stable business now.\" Its shares rose 7p to 428p. The board raised the interim dividend by 10% to 5.5p per share.",

His handling of their problems led to the couple slowly getting to know each other again and re-establishing intimate relations. </p> <p>A moving, interesting documentary, Better Sex was also badly weighted and frustrating. Petula and Chris's complex and compelling story simply overpowered Janet's and, in the end, her progress seemed almost like a footnote. Initially a main player, Janet was too quickly relegated to the benches, giving Better Sex a slightly disappointing conclusion. </p> <p>Fifteen years ago in another blue sky, forking plumes of white smoke signalled the destruction of the space shuttle Challenger and the death of its crew.

Jamie from EastEnders. I hate him.\" Dee Imani, 15: \"I think TV's all right, it has its moments, but I don't watch that much of it. I don't have my own TV, I prefer working on the computer and emailing people, chatrooms. I think it's a lot better for your mind, really. I can get to speak to people who like hip-hop all over the world.\" Dan Bearman, 17: \"I watch the 4 Later stuff, some of it, because I'm an insomniac. I watch the football and sometimes Later with Jools Holland, if anything good's on, Beck or something. I used to spend a lot of time watching all the archaeological programmes. I know all about excavations.\" Grace Ford, 14: \"I watch Pet Rescue when I come home from school because I like the animals. I watch Top Of The Pops and Cold Feet and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Have I ever seen Harry Enfeld's teenagers? Yes, and I'm exactly like that! I burnt half the kitchen down once, almost, when I did oven chips in the middle of the night. And I had a tantrum and left for two days. I used to be awful....\" \u0095 Sian Pattenden spoke to teenagers in south-west London.",

      "body": "<p>Large areas of the world have missed out on the information revolution, threatening to widen the gap between rich and poor unless governments take urgent action to bridge the digital divide, a report warns today. </p> <p>In its annual World Employment Report*, the International Labour Organisation says information and communications technology (ICT) has created jobs and spurred growth in industrialised countries but has yet to fully penetrate the developing world. </p> <p>Even within countries in which it has made a difference, there is a \"digital gender divide\", with men tending to occupy the better paid hi-tech jobs and women stuck in low level positions. </p> <p>\"The ICT revolution offers genuine potential, but also raises the risk that a significant portion of the world will lose out,\" said Juan Somavia, ILO director general. </p> <p>\"Let us strip out the hype. What is left? What's left is its effects on peoples' lives, wherever they live. We need to promote policies and develop institutions which let everybody benefit. And it won't happen on its own.\" </p> <p>The report says that despite an improving global employment situation, there are still some 160m people officially unemployed at the beginning of 2001 - 20m more than before the onset of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 - while many millions more suffer from underemployment. </p> <p>While unemployment in OECD countries has declined sharply from the double digit figures of the mid-90s, about 500m workers in the developing world are still unable to earn enough to keep their families above the poverty line, at $1a day. </p> <p>With some economists forecasting a recession in the US, the ILO says the prospects for the future depend very much on whether the present global expansion can be maintained. </p> <p>It expects growth to carry on reducing unemployment, but urges government to adopt the right policies to ensure the benefits of ICT are spread more evenly. These include investing in skills; giving women more opportunity; lowering telecoms costs through more competition; using ICT to improve health care, education and other social services; and focusing on basic education before \"digital literacy\". </p> <p> *World Employment Report 2001 - Life at work in the information economy; International Labour Office; telephone 020 7828 6401</p>",

      "bodyText": "Large areas of the world have missed out on the information revolution, threatening to widen the gap between rich and poor unless governments take urgent action to bridge the digital divide, a report warns today. In its annual World Employment Report*, the International Labour Organisation says information and communications technology (ICT) has created jobs and spurred growth in industrialised countries but has yet to fully penetrate the developing world. Even within countries in which it has made a difference, there is a \"digital gender divide\", with men tending to occupy the better paid hi-tech jobs and women stuck in low level positions. \"The ICT revolution offers genuine potential, but also raises the risk that a significant portion of the world will lose out,\" said Juan Somavia, ILO director general. \"Let us strip out the hype. What is left? What's left is its effects on peoples' lives, wherever they live. We need to promote policies and develop institutions which let everybody benefit. And it won't happen on its own.\" The report says that despite an improving global employment situation, there are still some 160m people officially unemployed at the beginning of 2001 - 20m more than before the onset of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 - while many millions more suffer from underemployment. While unemployment in OECD countries has declined sharply from the double digit figures of the mid-90s, about 500m workers in the developing world are still unable to earn enough to keep their families above the poverty line, at $1a day. With some economists forecasting a recession in the US, the ILO says the prospects for the future depend very much on whether the present global expansion can be maintained. It expects growth to carry on reducing unemployment, but urges government to adopt the right policies to ensure the benefits of ICT are spread more evenly. These include investing in skills; giving women more opportunity; lowering telecoms costs through more competition; using ICT to improve health care, education and other social services; and focusing on basic education before \"digital literacy\". *World Employment Report 2001 - Life at work in the information economy; International Labour Office; telephone 020 7828 6401",

A frantic round of talks failed to secure any denial from the company that it plans to axe several thousand jobs, mainly in Wales and northern England. Welsh first minister Rhodri Morgan said that his meeting with Corus chairman Sir Brian Moffat had not been very fruitful, but he pledged to continue lobbying until the announcement is made. Sir Brian told him a final decision on job losses had not been made, fuelling speculation that the announcement will be made next week. Manchester Metro deal Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian, yesterday announced a deal with Daily Mail &amp; General Trust to produce a Manchester version of the free London Metro paper. Editorial will come from DMGT's Associated Newspapers, while GMG will handle publishing, printing and distribution. GMG, which is licensing the title to Associated, publishes the Manchester Evening News and 30 weekly papers in the area. Metro has also been launched in Birmingham, Newcastle, Leeds, Sheffield, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Aeroflot hopes to fly green flag Aeroflot announced yesterday that it is in talks on buying a stake in budget carrier Virgin Express Ireland that could open up new European routes to the Russian company. The European Union's open skies agreement allows EU-licensed carriers to fly to any European destination if the route generates sufficient traffic and airport space is available. Former BoS governor dies Sir Alistair Grant, governor chairman of the Bank of Scotland until May 1999, died on Monday night after a long battle with illness. Sir Alistair, a core member of Scotland's business community, was also deputy chairman of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewery group. He stepped down as governor of the BoS due to poor health in May 1999 and moved down from chairman to deputy chairman of Scottish &amp; Newcastle in July 2000. Ship firm drops Cammell order The Italian company in dispute with Cammell Laird over an extension to the cruise ship Costa Classica cancelled the order yesterday, increasing fears for the Birkenhead shipyard on Merseyside. The company, Costa Crociere, said it had little choice but to terminate the \u00a351m deal with Cammell, claiming there was no chance that the yard would be capable of completing the contract to Costa's satisfaction. Union leaders expressed outrage and observers said the situation raised questions about the yard's ability to survive.

He had to stay silent until his contract ended, but by then Legacy had its peculiar \"preferred bidder\" status: his case may never be put.

PY plans to run it as a visitor attraction in the day with the present contents enhanced: in the evenings it will be a concert and sports venue. He will build a hotel and conference centre and use the land around the dome as a village of themed restaurants and attractions - no housing or offices. He claims he will get 3m visitors a year and make a profit after two years. He will even offer the government more money than Legacy's timid \u00a350m up front and \u00a3100m later. But he needs the attractions inside - especially the dazzling body zone sculpture (one of the few things of beauty). However, along with other key zones, the body will be demolished in two weeks. Will the government stay its hand and consider the PY bid?</p> <p>The government is now legally bound not to even speak with other bidders. It says it must consider whether Legacy is the best value. But how is that judged without considering alternatives, and above all the public interest? The public has punted up the cash and must have an interest in keeping this great national asset for their own pleasure: \u00a3150m is peanuts compared with the near \u00a31bn already spent, when the dome could be secured as a public amenity for ever.</p> <p>The key to all this is property value. Hotly though they deny it, there is a canny suspicion that the Legacy bid will end up as a property deal. The invaluable land around the dome will be developed, the \"hi-tech\" park within may never quite materialise, never quite find all these tenants it promises. Unused, the dome would dilapidate until someone someday makes a fortune out of the land it stands on.

But even if Legacy does all it says, it still shuts down a public place.</p> <p>Gerbeau's scheme also buys the site, but at least he keeps it as a public space (sale conditions should insist on that in perpetuity). Better still, PY would be quite happy to rent the dome for a fixed number of years which keeps open the option of returning it to public ownership at some future date - if ever an Olympic or World Cup bid required it. The land around is so valuable some could be sold off to create a trust fund for the dome's future. There are much more imaginative ways of saving the dome than selling it off in a hurry to Legacy. By now that will also be the worst political option, the one most likely to dog the government at the election: added to the breath of sleaze will be a grotesque mishandling of a priceless public asset.</p> <p>Politicians always lag behind the public mood, out of fashion, fighting old battles instead of facing future challenges. This government's 90s mindset still wrestles with clause 4 versus privatisation - dead ducks both. Money is poured into Railtrack in exchange for nothing at all, as if afraid that buying back shares in it is socialism incarnate. They are still trying to sell off the tube and air traffic control against passionate public opposition. Now they want to sell off one of the finest heritage sites in London, just as the Tories very nearly sold off half the National Gallery - saved only by Sainsburys.

With the Franco-German axis - until now, the driving force behind European integration - visibly fractured, Berlin is exploring new patterns of alliance within the European Union. Mr Fischer's visit is sensitive because he has emerged as a prime target for British Euro-sceptics after making an unashamed case for European federalism last year. The prime minister, Tony Blair, is to fly to Berlin for a dinner with the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, on Monday. Officials in Berlin said last night that the get-together had been prompted by the crisis in relations with Paris. French and German leaders are to discuss their divergent views at an emergency summit meeting on January 31, in Strasbourg. Their relations have been strained since the Nice summit in December that left them at loggerheads over the pace of integration. Government sources in Berlin said that, ahead of that potentially tricky encounter, Mr Schr\u00f6der was hoping to find common ground with Mr Blair. British officials said yesterday that Britain and Germany basically shared many of the same views in the run-up to the next intergovernmental conference. A Foreign Office source said: \"In 2004, we see British-German agenda being quite close on major issues.\" Both governments are keen to define which powers belong to the European institutions and which to nation states. A British official said this did not necessarily mean the repatriation of powers from European institutions to nation states: \"It is about making it clear to people that there is a limit to integration: that it is not an endless on-going process towards a federal state.\" The British government sees this as a way of blunting the Eurosceptic arguments. In contrast, France is resisting such a clear-cut definition of powers. Mr Schr\u00f6der needs a deal to allay the misgivings over European integration harboured by his country's regional governments, which have the power to block international treaties. Mr Fischer's role will be to try to allay British fears of a system in which the European Commission would play a more prominent role.

As the battle over tax and spending intensified yesterday, the Tory leadership admitted that the figure was overblown and had been quietly shelved.</p> <p>In an attempt to whet the public's appetite for tax cuts during last July's government spending round, the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, claimed that Gordon Brown's spending plans had spiralled out of control to the tune of \u00a3600 per taxpayer. This works out at \u00a316bn.</p> <p>Labour yesterday distributed a copy of a Portillo press release from last July, which unveiled the \u00a3600 figure, in an attempt to show that the Tories will impose \u00a316bn of cuts in public services - double the amount pledged by Mr Hague. The Tories, who are determined to rebut Labour's warn ings of swingeing cuts, were forced last night to concede that they no longer stood by the \u00a3600 claim. A spokesman said: \"That figure was an illustrative figure used at that time [in July].\"</p> <p>The spokesman said that Mr Portillo had come up with his original claim when he was planning to cut \u00a316bn from public services. However, this has been trimmed back to \u00a38bn over the past few months because Mr Portillo has decided that the cuts should be phased in.</p> <p>Under his plans, a Tory government would stick to Labour's spending plans for its first year in office. The cuts would be introduced on a phased basis in the second year, with the full \u00a38bn of cuts being introduced by the third year. \"We will plot a path,\" one source said. \"We will not try to rip up public spending immediately.\"</p> <p>The Tories' admission last night added to the sense that the leadership has worked out its tax and spending plans in a haphazard way. Labour accused the Tories of drawing up its plans on the back of the envelope after Mr Hague was forced to double the number of areas in which he would ringfence Labour's spending plans.</p> <p>However, the Tories will hope that their decision to abandon their claim on the government's increased tax burden will severely undermine Labour's claim that their cuts will amount to \u00a316bn. \"By scrabbling around in the wastepaper bin picking out old press releases shows how Labour have mucked this one up,\" one Tory source said. \"They rushed out the \u00a316bn figure and now it does not stand up.\"</p> <p>Labour stuck to its guns yesterday as it unveiled a nationwide poster campaign which claims that the Tories will be forced to impose cuts on schools and hospitals - areas supposedly ringfenced - to meet their \u00a316bn of cuts. Alistair Darling, the social security secretary, said: \"However much they try to deny and evade the simple fact is that the only way they can make their figures add up is to make massive cuts to public spending.\"</p>",

The Tories, who are determined to rebut Labour's warn ings of swingeing cuts, were forced last night to concede that they no longer stood by the \u00a3600 claim. A spokesman said: \"That figure was an illustrative figure used at that time [in July].\" The spokesman said that Mr Portillo had come up with his original claim when he was planning to cut \u00a316bn from public services. However, this has been trimmed back to \u00a38bn over the past few months because Mr Portillo has decided that the cuts should be phased in. Under his plans, a Tory government would stick to Labour's spending plans for its first year in office. The cuts would be introduced on a phased basis in the second year, with the full \u00a38bn of cuts being introduced by the third year. \"We will plot a path,\" one source said. \"We will not try to rip up public spending immediately.\" The Tories' admission last night added to the sense that the leadership has worked out its tax and spending plans in a haphazard way. Labour accused the Tories of drawing up its plans on the back of the envelope after Mr Hague was forced to double the number of areas in which he would ringfence Labour's spending plans. However, the Tories will hope that their decision to abandon their claim on the government's increased tax burden will severely undermine Labour's claim that their cuts will amount to \u00a316bn. \"By scrabbling around in the wastepaper bin picking out old press releases shows how Labour have mucked this one up,\" one Tory source said. \"They rushed out the \u00a316bn figure and now it does not stand up.\" Labour stuck to its guns yesterday as it unveiled a nationwide poster campaign which claims that the Tories will be forced to impose cuts on schools and hospitals - areas supposedly ringfenced - to meet their \u00a316bn of cuts. Alistair Darling, the social security secretary, said: \"However much they try to deny and evade the simple fact is that the only way they can make their figures add up is to make massive cuts to public spending.\"",

      "body": "<p>Firstly, let me apologise for not writing about Auberon Waugh. I know how much readers enjoy a glimpse into the lives of columnists and how it brightens your drab days to see us write about one another. </p> <p>Instead I have been thinking about stem cell research. It seems that roughly 2,000 years after the birth of Jesus, bishops still have a say in political affairs. You might say their role is nominal, just as it is often said that the monarchy has no real power - other than to cruise the world at our expense insulting foreigners in our name, and generally clouding our thinking with trivia about their longevity or inability to use a bath correctly. </p> <p>True, churches do not have the power they once enjoyed. Women don't get burnt for having a third nipple, although they do get jailed for not having a TV licence. But when society considers matters of ethics, it is deemed important for the views of \"faith communities\" to be solicited. Somehow, people who believe in a deity are still attributed with more, or at least special, moral authority. </p> <p>Indeed, some parents send children to religious schools on the grounds that it will \"teach them right from wrong\", as though we who don't believe in God have no guiding principles whatsoever. In fact, there is little in the scriptures that is directly useful in modifying children's behaviour. Moses does not descend from the mountain saying: \"If you can't be sensible with that Golden Calf, I'm going to put it away until you're older.\" </p> <p>This is not to say that religious people have nothing important to say.

      "bodyText": "Firstly, let me apologise for not writing about Auberon Waugh. I know how much readers enjoy a glimpse into the lives of columnists and how it brightens your drab days to see us write about one another. Instead I have been thinking about stem cell research. It seems that roughly 2,000 years after the birth of Jesus, bishops still have a say in political affairs. You might say their role is nominal, just as it is often said that the monarchy has no real power - other than to cruise the world at our expense insulting foreigners in our name, and generally clouding our thinking with trivia about their longevity or inability to use a bath correctly. True, churches do not have the power they once enjoyed. Women don't get burnt for having a third nipple, although they do get jailed for not having a TV licence. But when society considers matters of ethics, it is deemed important for the views of \"faith communities\" to be solicited. Somehow, people who believe in a deity are still attributed with more, or at least special, moral authority. Indeed, some parents send children to religious schools on the grounds that it will \"teach them right from wrong\", as though we who don't believe in God have no guiding principles whatsoever. In fact, there is little in the scriptures that is directly useful in modifying children's behaviour. Moses does not descend from the mountain saying: \"If you can't be sensible with that Golden Calf, I'm going to put it away until you're older.\" This is not to say that religious people have nothing important to say. I'm merely suggesting that ideas about justice, kindness, humility or the right to life are not exclusive to people who believe in God. And governments are quite selective in who gets to pontificate about ethics. I don't see Robin Cook running the ethical dimension to foreign policy past the Quakers for closer inspection.

      "bodyText": "Hospital managers yesterday promised to review every operation carried out by a pioneering surgeon suspended after complaints about her work. Consultant Briony Ackroyd was among the first in Britain to offer breast cancer victims a combined mastectomy and reconstruction operation. The tissue used often came from the abdomen, offering the patient a \"tummy tuck\". She was suspended from Walsgrave hospital in Coventry last February, following complaints about her procedures. Hospital managers confirmed yesterday that they had referred Miss Ackroyd, 52, to the General Medical Council, the medical profession's disciplinary body. Thirty cases of possible malpractice are being investigated by the GMC. Walsgrave hospital's chief executive, David Loughton, said that all Miss Ackroyd's cases over her six years at the hospital would be reviewed. \"We are working as quickly as we can to resolve this matter both for the hospital and patients concerned and for Miss Ackroyd's sake. \"It is fair to say we are looking at all cases Miss Ackroyd has undertaken while employed since 1995.\" Critics say the consultant's complication rate was too high and that her patients were not fully informed of the risks. Her supporters say they were comforted by her unconventional approach - which included visiting patients at home - and claim that she is the victim of a predominantly male medical establishment. Former patients have set up the Briony Ackroyd Support Group, which has collected more than 4,000 signatures calling for the surgeon's reinstatement, and more than 100 former patients have agreed to testify on her behalf at any GMC hearing. Local GPs are also backing her and at least one has agreed to speak for her at the GMC. However, the daughter of a former patient is calling for her to be struck off the medical register for life. Debra Butler blames Miss Ackroyd for persuading her mother, Janet Nixon, to have a breast reconstruction operation, during which she suffered a stroke that left her partially paralysed. The reconstruction also became infected and five further operations were needed to repair the damage. Mrs Nixon, 57, was paid \u00a351,000 in an out of court compensation settlement before her death in June last year. She received the compensation after obtaining an opinion from an independent expert which was harshly critical of Miss Ackroyd's work. In a statement to Mrs Nixon's solicitor, a consultant plastic surgeon, Christopher Ward, said that she had not been properly warned of the risks and would probably not have agreed to the surgical procedure if she had been. He said that although the breast removal was successful, in other areas of her treatment the standard of care fell below what was expected of surgeons taking on that particular operation. A GMC spokesman said it had had \"discussions with the hospital about this doctor\" after the hospital contacted it. Miss Ackroyd was referred to the GMC but no date for a hearing had yet been set, the spokesman added.",

Small motorboats bobbed up and down in the waves, dancing to the tune of the tide amid the scramble to avert a major ecological disaster from a 250,000-gallon oil spill just off the coast of the Galapagos islands.</p> <p>The young locals who manned the boats were scooping up diesel from the water, while sturdier vessels carried officials spraying chemicals to disperse the spill, or sizing up the conditions for refloating the ship.</p> <p>Amid all the activity, the only thing not moving was the Jessica itself. The tanker has been stuck on a reef for a week since it ran aground less than a mile from the shore of the island of San Cristobal.</p> <p>For several days the ship was merely a blot on the horizon of this volcanic island chain bursting with life, 600 miles from Ecuador in the middle of the Pacific. But then the ship tanks cracked and 180,000 gallons of diesel and 80 gallons of bunker fuel began to leak out, menacing the complex ecosystem supporting the species that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.</p> <p>On Monday the Ecuadorean government declared a state of emergency, but yesterday the environment minister, Rodolfo Rendon, said that the spilled diesel had shifted direction \"toward the northwest, which is an open zone where there are no major islands\".</p> <p>Oil reached Santa Fe Island, 37 miles west of San Cristobal, and pelicans have been found coated with oil, sea lions irritated by toxins and large numbers of dead sea urchins washed up on the shore, but the oil has now begun to move away from the island.</p> <p>\"We're not out of the woods yet, but in general we expect the ecosystem to recover,\" said Robert Bensted-Smith, the Shropshire-born director of the Charles Darwin research centre on the archipelago.</p> <p>Dr Bensted-Smith thanks the heavens for the escape. The wind and the currents were kind and pushed the spill out to sea, so that it was dispersed into streaks of oily film visible from the air as you fly into the tiny islands.</p> <p>Sunshine helped to evaporate much of the diesel, and the fact that the leak was relatively slow allowed for most of the thicker, more dangerous fuel to mix with the diesel and flow away more easily.</p> <p>So while praising the \"huge local effort\", and thanking the authorities and the US experts, the British biologist is sure that if the Galapagos is in fact safe from disaster it will be because \"the major part of what we had was luck\".</p> <p>He had been particularly concerned about the lava gulls. There are only a few hundred of these in the world and all of them are on the Galapagos. Any damage to their colonies could have been devastating.</p> <p>The gulls now appear safe, Dr Bensted-Smith said, but other species are still vulnerable, including the marine iguanas which may eat contaminated algae, the sea lions whose pups are particularly at risk, and the pelicans and blue-footed boobies which live around the shore. Not to mention that while most of the Jessica's tanks have now expelled their oil into the sea, there is still some left that could wash ashore in concentrated form if the favourable climatic conditions do not hold up.</p> <p>And that issue was at the top of the agenda at the daily midday coordinating meeting at the Ecuadorean base on the island, within sight of both the wreck and a smattering of sea lions basking in the sun in the bay by the pier.</p> <p>The navy and Galapagos reserve authorities want to pull the Jessica far out to sea to sink it, burying the remaining danger, and the evidence of its catastrophic potential.

      "bodyText": "Black surf broke over the semi-submerged wreck of the stricken oil tanker Jessica as we approached. Small motorboats bobbed up and down in the waves, dancing to the tune of the tide amid the scramble to avert a major ecological disaster from a 250,000-gallon oil spill just off the coast of the Galapagos islands. The young locals who manned the boats were scooping up diesel from the water, while sturdier vessels carried officials spraying chemicals to disperse the spill, or sizing up the conditions for refloating the ship. Amid all the activity, the only thing not moving was the Jessica itself. The tanker has been stuck on a reef for a week since it ran aground less than a mile from the shore of the island of San Cristobal. For several days the ship was merely a blot on the horizon of this volcanic island chain bursting with life, 600 miles from Ecuador in the middle of the Pacific. But then the ship tanks cracked and 180,000 gallons of diesel and 80 gallons of bunker fuel began to leak out, menacing the complex ecosystem supporting the species that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. On Monday the Ecuadorean government declared a state of emergency, but yesterday the environment minister, Rodolfo Rendon, said that the spilled diesel had shifted direction \"toward the northwest, which is an open zone where there are no major islands\". Oil reached Santa Fe Island, 37 miles west of San Cristobal, and pelicans have been found coated with oil, sea lions irritated by toxins and large numbers of dead sea urchins washed up on the shore, but the oil has now begun to move away from the island. \"We're not out of the woods yet, but in general we expect the ecosystem to recover,\" said Robert Bensted-Smith, the Shropshire-born director of the Charles Darwin research centre on the archipelago. Dr Bensted-Smith thanks the heavens for the escape. The wind and the currents were kind and pushed the spill out to sea, so that it was dispersed into streaks of oily film visible from the air as you fly into the tiny islands. Sunshine helped to evaporate much of the diesel, and the fact that the leak was relatively slow allowed for most of the thicker, more dangerous fuel to mix with the diesel and flow away more easily. So while praising the \"huge local effort\", and thanking the authorities and the US experts, the British biologist is sure that if the Galapagos is in fact safe from disaster it will be because \"the major part of what we had was luck\". He had been particularly concerned about the lava gulls. There are only a few hundred of these in the world and all of them are on the Galapagos. Any damage to their colonies could have been devastating. The gulls now appear safe, Dr Bensted-Smith said, but other species are still vulnerable, including the marine iguanas which may eat contaminated algae, the sea lions whose pups are particularly at risk, and the pelicans and blue-footed boobies which live around the shore. Not to mention that while most of the Jessica's tanks have now expelled their oil into the sea, there is still some left that could wash ashore in concentrated form if the favourable climatic conditions do not hold up. And that issue was at the top of the agenda at the daily midday coordinating meeting at the Ecuadorean base on the island, within sight of both the wreck and a smattering of sea lions basking in the sun in the bay by the pier. The navy and Galapagos reserve authorities want to pull the Jessica far out to sea to sink it, burying the remaining danger, and the evidence of its catastrophic potential. But US coast guard commander Edwin Stanton is not so sure that this is a good idea, as the reef is deep, the water above it shallow and the swells large. He would prefer to tip the vessel level and pump out the 17,000 gallons thought to remain in one of the ship's 10 tanks, and then wait until the sea calms before trying any thing more dramatic. \"The biggest risk now is that we wreck another ship trying to save this one, or that someone dies doing it,\" he said. There have been reports that the Ecuadorean government had waited until the last minute to start the clean-up operation because of concerns about the cost of the operation, expected to run to about half a million dollars. Now they are being more assertive about calling for aid. \"Ecuador is a very poor country and the Galapagos is patrimony of humanity, and the world is happy that the Galapagos exists. So now is the time for the world to do something to ensure it remains,\" said Ramiro Morejon, chief of operations of the reserve.

      "body": "<p>Britain is enthusiastically embracing the \"techno\" revolution at an astonishing pace with the rapid spread of the internet outstripped only by the explosion in the use of mobile phones, according to this month's Guardian/ICM opinion poll. </p> <p>The survey showed that in the last 12 months the internet had become a true mass medium in Britain with nearly half all adults now enjoying on line access at home or at work. In two years internet access had risen from 29% of all adults in January 1999 to 49% now, confirming that the internet was growing at a far faster pace than any previous technological advance, including radio and television. The spread of the internet was accelerating. The 8 percentage point rise in adults online in 1999 was followed by a 12 percentage point increase last year. </p> <p>But the ICM poll showed that even this impressive record was being outstripped by the spread of the mobile phone. Some 63% of all adults said that they now used a mobile phone to make and receive calls. </p> <p>The real success story has been the explosion in the use of mobile phones to send and receive text messages. Some 43% of the entire adult population said they used a mobile to send and receive text messages. This rose to an astonishing 76% of all 18 to 24 year olds who said they used text messaging. </p> <p>It was not just a teenage thing either. Among those up to the age of 35, 68% said they used the service. Over 35, and the figures started to drop sharply with only 41% of the middle aged using text messages and 10% of the over 65s. </p> <p>But while the poll revealed the extent of the explosion in the use of all this new technology it also confirmed that there was still a disturbing \"e-gap\" developing between the young and old, the rich and poor, and the north and south. It also showed that half the population was worried about the health hazards of mobile phones. One in four owners of modern video recorders admitted they did not know how to set its \"videoplus\" facility to record a programme while they were out of the house. </p> <p>The ICM survey showed that the rapid growth of internet use had been matched by the rise of multichannel television. Some 45% of homes - about 9m - now subscribed to Sky, Ondigital or cable television. The fact that the 11% of homes with Ondigital now also faced the choice of accessing the in ternet via their television rather than through a personal computer started to raise the prospects of \"convergence\" in the digital age. </p> <p>The great marketing flop has been the Wap phone, which gives access to the net via your mobile. Only 4% of the population said they used a Wap phone. </p> <p>There remained a big gap in terms of who had access to all this new technology. When it came to those who were online the rich and more affluent were much more likely to be on the net (73%) compared with the poor and unemployed, of whom only 21% had access. Fifty-four per cent of men and 44% of women said they had access to the net. Sixty three per cent of those under 35 were on the web but only 13% of the over 65s. </p> <p>Forty three per cent of northerners were hooked up, compared with 54% in the south. When ICM asked how enthusiastic adults were about it all, 68% said they \"very\" or \"fairly\" enthusiastic. Only 30% said they were not enthusiastic. </p> <p>As could be expected, the younger generation and men rather than women tended to be more excited but even 54% of the over 65s said they were happy to embrace these new developments. </p> <p>One of the greatest worries is the possible health hazards of mobile phones which nearly half the population said they are concerned about. When ICM asked if they were worried enough to put them off buying a mobile phone or to use their existing phone less, some 21% said it had affected their behaviour. </p> <p>\u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,004 adults aged over 18 by telephone from January 19-21. Interviews were conducted across the country and results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.</p>",

Some 45% of homes - about 9m - now subscribed to Sky, Ondigital or cable television. The fact that the 11% of homes with Ondigital now also faced the choice of accessing the in ternet via their television rather than through a personal computer started to raise the prospects of \"convergence\" in the digital age. The great marketing flop has been the Wap phone, which gives access to the net via your mobile. Only 4% of the population said they used a Wap phone. There remained a big gap in terms of who had access to all this new technology. When it came to those who were online the rich and more affluent were much more likely to be on the net (73%) compared with the poor and unemployed, of whom only 21% had access. Fifty-four per cent of men and 44% of women said they had access to the net. Sixty three per cent of those under 35 were on the web but only 13% of the over 65s. Forty three per cent of northerners were hooked up, compared with 54% in the south. When ICM asked how enthusiastic adults were about it all, 68% said they \"very\" or \"fairly\" enthusiastic. Only 30% said they were not enthusiastic. As could be expected, the younger generation and men rather than women tended to be more excited but even 54% of the over 65s said they were happy to embrace these new developments. One of the greatest worries is the possible health hazards of mobile phones which nearly half the population said they are concerned about. When ICM asked if they were worried enough to put them off buying a mobile phone or to use their existing phone less, some 21% said it had affected their behaviour. \u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,004 adults aged over 18 by telephone from January 19-21. Interviews were conducted across the country and results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The lawsuit over Victoria Beckham's missing luggage has given us a better insight into the Posh life than any celebrity interview ever could. She travels with 11 pieces of baggage (\"most of my luggage was Louis Vuitton\"), her bikini top is by Maria Grachvogel, her denim jacket is a Ralph Lauren. To top it all off, the alleged thief made contact with Beckham through her \"nail technician\".</p> <p>Yet while some balked and puzzled at the term \"nail technician\", to many women (and some men), this is the most normal part of such life of luxury. Like skinny double caffe lattes and text messaging, nail bars have become part of the daily urban landscape in Britain over the past two or three years. Those without much interest in French manicures and nail transfers could easily have missed them, but so-called nail bars (beauty salons for your hands) are now thriving on British high streets.</p> <p>Nail technicians, however, are no common-or-garden manicurists. They are the surgeons of the manicuring world. If you want false nails, nail extensions, nail piercings, nail transfers, nail infills, nail art or nail airbrushing, find yourself a nail technician.</p> <p>\"Basically, a manicurist works with the natural nail but a nail technician is someone who works with false nails,\" explains Joanne King, beauty manager at the Aveda Salon in Harvey Nichols, London. \"They apply false nails, extensions and infills, and can make art on the false nails, such as designs and piercings.\"</p> <p>Sceptics might be surprised to hear this fad is not exclusive to the under eights. \"One woman came in who was well into her 60s and she had a coffee-bean stud pierced through the tip of her nail,\" says King. \"But then, she did have mad hair.\"</p> <p>Nails Inc, in South Molton Street, London, offers nail art in any design you could ever desire, all for \u00a325. \"The most memorable request was the Louis Vuitton logo for a fashion shoot!\" says manager, Emma Knowles. You can also have nail transfers, designed by the uber-trendy Jade Jagger, applied for \u00a310.</p> <p>Visitors to their salon have included Jennifer Lopez for an acrylic infill (\u00a330), the Spice Girls for manicures (presumably in the pre-nail technician days for Victoria) and Jane MacDonald, singer from the docudrama Cruise. That list says it all - the ultra glam such as La Lopez have nail extensions, but so do the common folk.</p> <p>This nail obsession has drifted from America - or New York, to be precise. In uptown Manhattan, there have been nail bars on every street for the past 10 years, offering 30-minute manicures for $7. Having a manicure is as normal and easy as stopping off at the supermarket on your way home from work. And nails are taken very, very seriously. In New York, manicurists should be registered with the Council of Nail Technicians, which requires passing a test. As yet, there is no such stipulation in the UK, but nail technicians do have to go through several months of training.</p> <p>\"Lots of American tourists were coming here and wanting to get their nails done while they were visiting Britain, so that created a demand in this country for nail bars,\" says King.</p> <p>Also, the arrival of glamorous American television programmes in this country, such as Friends and Sex in the City, has also whetted some British appetites for similar high-maintenance lifestyles - and manicures and nail technicians are part of that (along with personal trainers, weekly body scrubs, visits to the nutritionist ...) \"Having your nails done, and having amazing designs on them, is no longer seen as just a treat,\" says Knowles.</p> <p>Chris Rhoda, an office manager for an investment capital company, first had nail extensions applied a year ago and now goes for infills every three to four weeks.</p> <p>\"I used to break my nails all the time, and really manky nails look so awful. They can ruin a fabulous outfit. Now nail bars are just so handy - you go, you chat, you have your nails done. It is totally worth the time and money.\"</p> <p>Just 10 years ago to have a manicure summoned up images of Ivana Trump and elderly ladies with blue rinses. They belonged to the glamorised 80s universe of Dynasty, and were the province of older women with plenty of time and big baubles on their hands. For those under the age of 60, to have a manicure was unimaginably pretentious.</p> <p>The late Florence Griffith Joyner, the Olympic runner, showed the world how downright sexy improbable talons looked on a young confident woman when she won three gold medals in 1988, but it wasn't until the rise of mass-market hip hop in the late 90s that the fad took off. Singers Li'l Kim, Missy Elliot and Destiny's Child, who appeal to both sexes of all ages, all sport fabulously ridiculous nails.</p> <p>Ruth Drake, 26, who works for a music PR company, agrees. She had long false nails applied before going to Miami last year. \"I wanted to look bling-bling [extravagant]. I used to think that long, fake nails looked really tacky but then I thought they looked really cool.\"</p> <p>All the examples cited above are black. Are extravagant nails more common for black women than white?</p> <p>\"Yes, absolutely,\" agrees Lannah Nguyen, manageress of Las Vegas Nails in Holborn. \"Most of my clients who want piercings and stuff are young black girls. I think it's because black women tend to be more colourful, whereas white women are often more conservative. But the trend is definitely growing in the white community now.\" The look is, as Drake says, \"ghetto fabulous\" - that extravagant look mocked by Ali G, now rendered fashionable thanks to singers such as Lopez and Puff Daddy. The rise of nail technicians reflects this, as well as aspirations to the Sex in the City manicure lifestyle.</p> <p>How typical of Victoria Beckham to help turn the once-irredeemably tacky into something that will always be associated with posh.</p> <p><b>Nail polish: the technician's craft</b></p> <p><b> Nail art:</b> the general term for attention-grabbing art on nails. This could be images applied to individual nails, such as faces, sunsets, palm trees, etc, patterns (such as stripes, polka dots, etc), or unusual colour patterns.</p> <p><b> Airbrushing: </b> paint comes out of a tube filled with compressed air. This allows the technician to create intricate and miniature images on nails.</p> <p><b> Piercing:</b> a tiny drill pierces a hole through the tip of the false nail and a nail ring can then dangle through it.</p> <p><b> Transfers:</b> an image applied to your nail, like a sticker.</p> <p><b> Nail extensions:</b> acrylic or occasionally fibre glass, gel or another material, is affixed to the tip of your nail to make it appear longer.</p> <p><b> Nail enhancements:</b> known to you and me as false nails. These generally come in gel, fibre glass and acrylic. They can last forever, but you will need frequent infills to fill in the base of your nail when the growth of your real nail underneath pushes up the false nail.</p> <p><b> Nail infills:</b> see above.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The lawsuit over Victoria Beckham's missing luggage has given us a better insight into the Posh life than any celebrity interview ever could. She travels with 11 pieces of baggage (\"most of my luggage was Louis Vuitton\"), her bikini top is by Maria Grachvogel, her denim jacket is a Ralph Lauren. To top it all off, the alleged thief made contact with Beckham through her \"nail technician\". Yet while some balked and puzzled at the term \"nail technician\", to many women (and some men), this is the most normal part of such life of luxury. Like skinny double caffe lattes and text messaging, nail bars have become part of the daily urban landscape in Britain over the past two or three years. Those without much interest in French manicures and nail transfers could easily have missed them, but so-called nail bars (beauty salons for your hands) are now thriving on British high streets. Nail technicians, however, are no common-or-garden manicurists. They are the surgeons of the manicuring world. If you want false nails, nail extensions, nail piercings, nail transfers, nail infills, nail art or nail airbrushing, find yourself a nail technician. \"Basically, a manicurist works with the natural nail but a nail technician is someone who works with false nails,\" explains Joanne King, beauty manager at the Aveda Salon in Harvey Nichols, London. \"They apply false nails, extensions and infills, and can make art on the false nails, such as designs and piercings.\" Sceptics might be surprised to hear this fad is not exclusive to the under eights. \"One woman came in who was well into her 60s and she had a coffee-bean stud pierced through the tip of her nail,\" says King. \"But then, she did have mad hair.\" Nails Inc, in South Molton Street, London, offers nail art in any design you could ever desire, all for \u00a325. \"The most memorable request was the Louis Vuitton logo for a fashion shoot!\" says manager, Emma Knowles. You can also have nail transfers, designed by the uber-trendy Jade Jagger, applied for \u00a310. Visitors to their salon have included Jennifer Lopez for an acrylic infill (\u00a330), the Spice Girls for manicures (presumably in the pre-nail technician days for Victoria) and Jane MacDonald, singer from the docudrama Cruise. That list says it all - the ultra glam such as La Lopez have nail extensions, but so do the common folk. This nail obsession has drifted from America - or New York, to be precise. In uptown Manhattan, there have been nail bars on every street for the past 10 years, offering 30-minute manicures for $7. Having a manicure is as normal and easy as stopping off at the supermarket on your way home from work. And nails are taken very, very seriously. In New York, manicurists should be registered with the Council of Nail Technicians, which requires passing a test. As yet, there is no such stipulation in the UK, but nail technicians do have to go through several months of training. \"Lots of American tourists were coming here and wanting to get their nails done while they were visiting Britain, so that created a demand in this country for nail bars,\" says King. Also, the arrival of glamorous American television programmes in this country, such as Friends and Sex in the City, has also whetted some British appetites for similar high-maintenance lifestyles - and manicures and nail technicians are part of that (along with personal trainers, weekly body scrubs, visits to the nutritionist ...) \"Having your nails done, and having amazing designs on them, is no longer seen as just a treat,\" says Knowles. Chris Rhoda, an office manager for an investment capital company, first had nail extensions applied a year ago and now goes for infills every three to four weeks. \"I used to break my nails all the time, and really manky nails look so awful. They can ruin a fabulous outfit. Now nail bars are just so handy - you go, you chat, you have your nails done. It is totally worth the time and money.\" Just 10 years ago to have a manicure summoned up images of Ivana Trump and elderly ladies with blue rinses. They belonged to the glamorised 80s universe of Dynasty, and were the province of older women with plenty of time and big baubles on their hands. For those under the age of 60, to have a manicure was unimaginably pretentious. The late Florence Griffith Joyner, the Olympic runner, showed the world how downright sexy improbable talons looked on a young confident woman when she won three gold medals in 1988, but it wasn't until the rise of mass-market hip hop in the late 90s that the fad took off. Singers Li'l Kim, Missy Elliot and Destiny's Child, who appeal to both sexes of all ages, all sport fabulously ridiculous nails. Ruth Drake, 26, who works for a music PR company, agrees. She had long false nails applied before going to Miami last year. \"I wanted to look bling-bling [extravagant]. I used to think that long, fake nails looked really tacky but then I thought they looked really cool.\" All the examples cited above are black. Are extravagant nails more common for black women than white? \"Yes, absolutely,\" agrees Lannah Nguyen, manageress of Las Vegas Nails in Holborn. \"Most of my clients who want piercings and stuff are young black girls. I think it's because black women tend to be more colourful, whereas white women are often more conservative. But the trend is definitely growing in the white community now.\" The look is, as Drake says, \"ghetto fabulous\" - that extravagant look mocked by Ali G, now rendered fashionable thanks to singers such as Lopez and Puff Daddy. The rise of nail technicians reflects this, as well as aspirations to the Sex in the City manicure lifestyle. How typical of Victoria Beckham to help turn the once-irredeemably tacky into something that will always be associated with posh. Nail polish: the technician's craft Nail art: the general term for attention-grabbing art on nails. This could be images applied to individual nails, such as faces, sunsets, palm trees, etc, patterns (such as stripes, polka dots, etc), or unusual colour patterns. Airbrushing: paint comes out of a tube filled with compressed air. This allows the technician to create intricate and miniature images on nails. Piercing: a tiny drill pierces a hole through the tip of the false nail and a nail ring can then dangle through it. Transfers: an image applied to your nail, like a sticker. Nail extensions: acrylic or occasionally fibre glass, gel or another material, is affixed to the tip of your nail to make it appear longer. Nail enhancements: known to you and me as false nails. These generally come in gel, fibre glass and acrylic. They can last forever, but you will need frequent infills to fill in the base of your nail when the growth of your real nail underneath pushes up the false nail. Nail infills: see above.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the 1994 BBC Reith lectures, the writer and critic Marina Warner observed that arguing about the past has become \"a vital part of being a member of society, an ordinary but important act of citizenship, a factor in establishing the idea of a home as a place where you would like to belong, and might be allowed to stay\". The current row over Holocaust Memorial Day exemplifies the tangled relationship between history and home.</p> <p>Britain's first Holocaust Memorial Day, on Saturday, will be marked by a ceremony in London attended by political and religious leaders and broadcast live by the BBC. Similar gatherings will be held around the country and schools will hold special assemblies and classes inspired by the day's message: Remembering Genocides. Lessons for the Future.</p> <p>At first sight this would seem laudable, but the event has been denounced as irrelevant and hypocritical from the left and the right. Representatives of the Armenian community have condemned the day for apparently excluding the slaughter of Armenians by the Turks in 1915-16. They have accused the government of colluding in the denial of the Armenian genocide in order to avoid offending Turkey.</p> <p>These are serious charges. However, there is more at stake than arguments about the \"uniqueness\" of the Holocaust or the pathos of the government's \"ethical\" foreign policy. Those who condemn the event entirely, or merely criticise its \"exclusivity\", are prone to moral and political myopia.</p> <p>They are so mired in either universalism or particularism that they have failed to notice that Holocaust Memorial Day is a step towards realising the vision in the Parekh report on the future of multi-ethnic Britain. This development in itself has to be appreciated in the context of global changes which presage the emergence of a new international morality.</p> <p>None of this occurs to adversaries such as the Observer columnist Nick Cohen, who take their cue from antagonists of the so-called Holocaust industry. They deny that the Holocaust is relevant to Britain and ridicule the idea that it has lessons for today. If the government is serious, why is it locking up asylum seekers and selling arms to regimes with poor records on human rights?</p> <p>Isn't the Holocaust actually being used to avoid engagement with contemporary atrocities by requiring them to meet an impossible standard before they merit intervention? From the other extreme, the Daily Telegraph has declared that \"a special day to commemorate the Nazis' six million Jewish victims was a bad idea in the first place\".</p> <p>Using it to push ideas of political toleration, ethnic inclusivity, and cultural diversity \"is to belittle the enormity of what happened, to help bolster New Labour's spurious claim that Britain is riddled with racism\". The day \"does not deserve wide public support\". When the bien penseuses of the left concur with the Daily Telegraph in loathing something, you know it has to be right.</p> <p>Apart from the fact that Britain was embroiled in the fate of the Jews between 1933 and 1945, Nazi racial-biological policies perpetrated a crime against humanity. Humanity does not stop at the white cliffs of Dover. The day was never intended to be just about Jewish suffering: it will highlight onslaughts against a range of other populations in Nazi Europe and afterwards, including Cambodia, Bosnia, and Rwanda.</p> <p>There are sound reasons why the day made Nazi atrocities a springboard for examining genocides after 1945. The Nazi assault on the Jews differed from anything that had preceded it. That was why in 1943 Rafael Lemkin invented the concept of genocide: to define something new. The choice of subsequent cases can be debated endlessly, but it is puerile to insist that because the selection is imperfect no one should benefit.</p> <p>The Holocaust was a dormant subject until the 70s, but before that there was not much interest in previous genocides either. A general shift in the ethical and cultural climate is responsible for concern about the victims of the past. According to Elazar Barkan, author of The Guilt of Nations, \"a new international morality\" has gradually fallen into place since the 50s.</p> <p>It began with West Germany's admission of responsibility for Nazi crimes and making reparations to the victims. It was accelerated in the United States when, as part of the 60s Great Society policy, the administration heeded the legacy of slavery and racism, and instigated social policies to correct their effects.</p> <p>Suddenly the memories harboured by survivors of persecution were no longer a private affair: it was recognised as part of their identity as members of a group. Moreover, this group had a right to claim compensation. Diaspora groups used the democratic process to mobilise and pursue their claims.</p> <p>Because collective memory is now accepted as integral to personal and group identity, perceptions of history and their ramifications must be accommodated in a pluralistic society. In his 2000 report for the Runnymede Trust, The Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain, Lord (Bhikhu) Parekh contended that to achieve such a goal it would be necessary to retell Britain's \"national story\".</p> <p>This entails challenging the myth of Britain as unified and uniform from time immemorial until the arrival of those pesky immigrants. It means questioning the \"civic and secular character\" of liberal constitutionalism and religious toleration by recognising that they are \"embedded in particular cultural values and traditions\" with an ethnic hue. Above all, it requires disrupting the simplistic glorification of Empire and recognising the ambiguous impact of British expansionism which was, after all, ultimately responsible for most post-1945 immigration.</p> <p>Whereas Remembrance Day each November was harnessed to the myth of a doughty island race defending democracy and toleration, Holocaust Memorial Day provokes a queasy reading of British history: a tale of half-hearted opposition to fascism, the mean-spirited treatment of refugees, and prevarication in the face of persecution, later genocide. It begs questions about Britain's role in recent international crises and the treatment of asylum seekers. Yet it can also give those who have found refuge in this country a sense that their scarred memory has become part of our national heritage.</p> <p>Of course, the day is not perfect. But it will take place annually and it is appropriate if it remains contested ground. Unlike the monolithic remembrance of Britain's mythic past, it defies monopoly. By remembering genocides we are acknowledging the way that past catastrophes have helped to create a multi-ethnic Britain. By confronting the history of intolerance we can help to forge a society in which such things will not recur and the once persecuted can, at last, feel at home.</p> <p>\u0095 David Cesarani is professor of modern Jewish history at Southampton University and a member of the Holocaust Memorial Day steering group. This article reflects his personal views.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the 1994 BBC Reith lectures, the writer and critic Marina Warner observed that arguing about the past has become \"a vital part of being a member of society, an ordinary but important act of citizenship, a factor in establishing the idea of a home as a place where you would like to belong, and might be allowed to stay\". The current row over Holocaust Memorial Day exemplifies the tangled relationship between history and home. Britain's first Holocaust Memorial Day, on Saturday, will be marked by a ceremony in London attended by political and religious leaders and broadcast live by the BBC. Similar gatherings will be held around the country and schools will hold special assemblies and classes inspired by the day's message: Remembering Genocides. Lessons for the Future. At first sight this would seem laudable, but the event has been denounced as irrelevant and hypocritical from the left and the right. Representatives of the Armenian community have condemned the day for apparently excluding the slaughter of Armenians by the Turks in 1915-16. They have accused the government of colluding in the denial of the Armenian genocide in order to avoid offending Turkey. These are serious charges. However, there is more at stake than arguments about the \"uniqueness\" of the Holocaust or the pathos of the government's \"ethical\" foreign policy. Those who condemn the event entirely, or merely criticise its \"exclusivity\", are prone to moral and political myopia. They are so mired in either universalism or particularism that they have failed to notice that Holocaust Memorial Day is a step towards realising the vision in the Parekh report on the future of multi-ethnic Britain. This development in itself has to be appreciated in the context of global changes which presage the emergence of a new international morality. None of this occurs to adversaries such as the Observer columnist Nick Cohen, who take their cue from antagonists of the so-called Holocaust industry. They deny that the Holocaust is relevant to Britain and ridicule the idea that it has lessons for today. If the government is serious, why is it locking up asylum seekers and selling arms to regimes with poor records on human rights? Isn't the Holocaust actually being used to avoid engagement with contemporary atrocities by requiring them to meet an impossible standard before they merit intervention? From the other extreme, the Daily Telegraph has declared that \"a special day to commemorate the Nazis' six million Jewish victims was a bad idea in the first place\". Using it to push ideas of political toleration, ethnic inclusivity, and cultural diversity \"is to belittle the enormity of what happened, to help bolster New Labour's spurious claim that Britain is riddled with racism\". The day \"does not deserve wide public support\". When the bien penseuses of the left concur with the Daily Telegraph in loathing something, you know it has to be right. Apart from the fact that Britain was embroiled in the fate of the Jews between 1933 and 1945, Nazi racial-biological policies perpetrated a crime against humanity. Humanity does not stop at the white cliffs of Dover. The day was never intended to be just about Jewish suffering: it will highlight onslaughts against a range of other populations in Nazi Europe and afterwards, including Cambodia, Bosnia, and Rwanda. There are sound reasons why the day made Nazi atrocities a springboard for examining genocides after 1945. The Nazi assault on the Jews differed from anything that had preceded it. That was why in 1943 Rafael Lemkin invented the concept of genocide: to define something new. The choice of subsequent cases can be debated endlessly, but it is puerile to insist that because the selection is imperfect no one should benefit. The Holocaust was a dormant subject until the 70s, but before that there was not much interest in previous genocides either. A general shift in the ethical and cultural climate is responsible for concern about the victims of the past. According to Elazar Barkan, author of The Guilt of Nations, \"a new international morality\" has gradually fallen into place since the 50s. It began with West Germany's admission of responsibility for Nazi crimes and making reparations to the victims. It was accelerated in the United States when, as part of the 60s Great Society policy, the administration heeded the legacy of slavery and racism, and instigated social policies to correct their effects. Suddenly the memories harboured by survivors of persecution were no longer a private affair: it was recognised as part of their identity as members of a group. Moreover, this group had a right to claim compensation. Diaspora groups used the democratic process to mobilise and pursue their claims. Because collective memory is now accepted as integral to personal and group identity, perceptions of history and their ramifications must be accommodated in a pluralistic society. In his 2000 report for the Runnymede Trust, The Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain, Lord (Bhikhu) Parekh contended that to achieve such a goal it would be necessary to retell Britain's \"national story\". This entails challenging the myth of Britain as unified and uniform from time immemorial until the arrival of those pesky immigrants. It means questioning the \"civic and secular character\" of liberal constitutionalism and religious toleration by recognising that they are \"embedded in particular cultural values and traditions\" with an ethnic hue. Above all, it requires disrupting the simplistic glorification of Empire and recognising the ambiguous impact of British expansionism which was, after all, ultimately responsible for most post-1945 immigration. Whereas Remembrance Day each November was harnessed to the myth of a doughty island race defending democracy and toleration, Holocaust Memorial Day provokes a queasy reading of British history: a tale of half-hearted opposition to fascism, the mean-spirited treatment of refugees, and prevarication in the face of persecution, later genocide. It begs questions about Britain's role in recent international crises and the treatment of asylum seekers. Yet it can also give those who have found refuge in this country a sense that their scarred memory has become part of our national heritage. Of course, the day is not perfect. But it will take place annually and it is appropriate if it remains contested ground. Unlike the monolithic remembrance of Britain's mythic past, it defies monopoly. By remembering genocides we are acknowledging the way that past catastrophes have helped to create a multi-ethnic Britain. By confronting the history of intolerance we can help to forge a society in which such things will not recur and the once persecuted can, at last, feel at home. \u0095 David Cesarani is professor of modern Jewish history at Southampton University and a member of the Holocaust Memorial Day steering group.

That's what this music tells us. That's why this music is important.\" </p> <p>Bonney makes no secret of the fact that, in general, she feels more at home on the concert platform as a lieder singer than on a theatre stage. She likes to be able to make eye contact with the audience - impossible if you're in an opera, where the audience is a black shape somewhere out beyond the orchestra pit. </p> <p>This is also about control.

Years later, at the end of a lengthy fraud trial, I congratulated the jury for their patience in sitting through what was undoubtedly the most boring case ever heard in the Old Bailey. In one of the better judicial put-downs a more tolerable judge started his summing up with: \"Members of the jury. It may come as a surprise to you to know that the sole purpose of the criminal law of England is not to entertain Mr Mortimer ...\" </p> <p>Were these legal authorities right? Are trials not a form of public entertainment: a sell-out, for instance, when the late lamented George Carman was starring in a sensational libel action, and a depressing lack of bums on seats during a lengthy VAT trail in Snaresbrook? </p> <p>Having spent a good deal of my life either appearing in real trials or writing trial scenes for drama, and now having written a theatre play about crime and judgment, I have to wonder how near to the theatre the Old Bailey is. The two worlds collided most neatly and satisfactorily for me during the OJ Simpson trial. </p> <p>One of the defending lawyers got up and said to Judge Ito: \"I think, your honour, that we are, as Mr Rumpole would say, in danger of getting a case of premature adjudication,\" which is something that Rumpole does say. Legal truth and legal fiction seemed to have become satisfactorily mixed. </p> <p>There is, of course, one factor that distinguishes the Old Bailey from the West Yorkshire Playhouse. No one leaves the theatre to start a sentence of life imprisonment. But there is a good deal of acting down at the Bailey. Habitual criminals are playing cheerful and hopefully lovable Cockney characters, barristers are acting charming and sensible men of the world, and judges are still imitating Felix Aylmer in old movies and rehearsing lines like: \"What are the Beatles?\" </p> <p>Work in court, as in the theatre, starts by dressing up. QCs' tail coats and waistcoats have now been reduced to one-piece \"monkey jackets\", which, under a silk gown, give merely the appearance of a tail coat - another theatrical trick. In front of the mirrors winged collars are clamped on, white bands tied, wigs adjusted. </p> <p>The legal taste for strange costumes can be exaggerated. I once defended a man accused of murder, who was brought up from the cells on the first day of the Old Bailey session. He was met with the sight of a City dignitary wearing a hat like a fur muff and carrying a sword, another in a three-cornered hat with black ostrich feathers and a judge sniffing a nosegay designed to ward off the stench of Newgate prison, which had been pulled down at the beginning of the century. </p> <p>My client cried out, \"The day of judgment is at hand!\" and had to be removed to a criminal lunatic asylum. In this case it may be thought that the legal love of theatre had gone too far; but it must be remembered that professional criminals don't want to be sent down by judges casually dressed in T-shirts and trainers. They like to get justice done in the full monty, so to speak. </p> <p>Once you are properly dressed, wigged and gowned, how much is appearing in court like acting in a play? </p> <p>In some ways the language is even more archaic and the meanings more deeply hidden than in the theatre, particularly when addressing judges. \"If I may humbly submit to your lordship,\" means, \"Shut up, you old fart, and listen to me,\" and, \"Your lordship puts the point far better than I can,\" means, \"Well done, dickhead, you've got it at last.\" Performing to a jury does entail, however, the use of simple, direct language and can be greatly assisted by theatrical technique. </p> <p>My father, an accomplished courtroom advocate, once appeared for a well-known comedian who congratulated him on his timing. From then on my father became very keen on timing and always used to count up to 10 in silence before asking the first question. This, he said, unnerved hostile witnesses and made them think you were planning a devastating attack. In my early days I tried the same technique, and was instantly told to get on with it by the judge and not to keep everyone waiting while I stood in silent prayer. </p> <p>Edward Marshall Hall, perhaps the greatest criminal defender, was always preceded into court by three clerks, one carrying a pile of clean handkerchiefs, the next with a carafe of water and the third bearing an air cushion. If the prosecution evidence was impressive he would blow his nose, a loud and terrible trumpet, on the handkerchiefs; if it got more dangerous he would knock over the carafe of water; if it looked like becoming fatal he would slowly and deliberately blow up the air cushion, and so attract the jury's undivided attention. </p> <p> Marshall Hall's acting technique was old fashioned, but wonderfully effective. He would end his final speech by holding out his arms to represent the scales of justice. \"Evenly balanced, until you put in one side that small feather, the presumption of innocence. And then\" - and here one arm sank - \"the scales come down on the side of the defence.\" On one occasion the judge, a merciless dramatic critic, told the jury that he was always pleased when Marshall Hall came to his scales of justice act, \"Because that means his speech is almost over.\" </p> <p>All the same, some of Marshall Hall's theatrical moments were admirable. He defended a terrified young prostitute accused of murder. \"Look at her, members of the jury.\" He pointed to the miserable girl in the dock. \"God never gave her a chance! Will you?\" I never went as far as Marshall Hall, only daring to chew Polo mints moderately loudly during a prosecutor's opening speech. </p> <p>But there are, it seems to me, legitimate uses of theatrical techniques in courtrooms. Opening a case to a jury you have to tell a story in a way that holds the audience's attention, using pauses and suspense to keep them listening. You should never lose your temper, but there are moments when you can act anger and outrage, either at the prosecution or, in extreme cases, if you decide to ditch a particularly hostile judge. </p> <p>As the result of my pretended anger in a case in Singapore the prosecutor asked for time off so he could recover from my attack, probably with bed rest and counselling. The Chinese judge thought this was absolutely pathetic and we won the case. Simulated anger, however, should be used only in extreme cases and simulated weeping never. </p> <p>So how does all this affect courtroom drama? Real trials, which go at the speed of a judge's note, are too slow to be reproduced on stage, and the activity in court - the constant coming and going, whispering, telephoning by the clerk of the court, covert doing of crosswords during boring stretches - is never seen on television. But writing a play that deals with matters of justice, I am on familiar ground. </p> <p>The jury, now called the audience, has to be asked to perform an act of the imagination, either in picturing the scene of a real crime or accepting that the actors are real people. One weapon open to the courtroom advocate is not available in the theatre. You can, in extreme cases, bore a judge into submission. </p> <p>You can go on until he is in real danger of missing the last train to Godalming. Bore an audience for five minutes and you've lost them for an hour. There is no place for boredom in the theatre, which is what makes plays more enjoyable than trials.

Radicalised, like so many of his generation, by the political flux of the time, he worked prolifically in the fields of criminology, politics, urban studies, sport and popular culture. He was a polymath, writing on a wide array of subjects, including soccer hooliganism, gun control, the Hillsborough disaster, glam rock and money laundering.</p> <p>His recent work included an article and a consultancy on the Italian village planned in Manchester, and his last piece, written from his hospital bed for the Times Literary Supplement, was about Canadian populism and the so-called \"common sense revolution\".</p> <p>In the 1980s, while working as a professor at Carleton University in Canada, Taylor began to develop a criminology which rooted the problem of crime within the wider political economy, a position that became the hallmark of his later work. But his interests were not solely theoretical. Following the Dunblane massacre, he became active, both politically and as a researcher, in the campaign to control gun ownership, which made him the target of attack. Numerous packages, containing bullets, used syringes and decaying meat, arrived at his address, and the police eventually arrested an irate gun enthusiast.</p> <p>Taylor's latest book, to my mind the best, is Crime In Context (1999). In it, he traces not only how market societies generate crime, but how crime itself can be seen as operating as a market place. Critically acclaimed, it was awarded the American Society of Criminology's prestigious Michael J Hindelang award.</p> <p>Taylor was born in Sheffield and educated at Durham and Cambridge universities, returning to Durham to complete his PhD. His first job was at the University of Bradford, but he spent a considerable part of his working life in Canada and Australia. It was in Canada that he met his wife Ruth Jamieson, with whom he had two much-loved daughters, Jean and Anna.</p> <p>His relationship with Ruth was to be a great intellectual partnership: they influenced and supported each other's work, and together wrote on areas as diverse as masculine protest in the de-industrialised cities of present-day Britain and the trafficking of humans across European borders.</p> <p>Taylor's years in Canada were happy, but he missed the sport and the politics of home. I remember visiting him in Ottawa; there was an airmailed New Statesman on the table, a video of Match Of The Day playing on the television. He returned to England in 1989 and took up the chair of sociology at the University of Salford. His book, A Tale Of Two Cities, written in this period with his research team, about Manchester and Sheffield, is a classic documentation of the shape and direction of urban anxieties at the end of the 20th century.</p> <p>But it was on Europe that Taylor's major research focused. An ardent European, he revelled in the multiplicity of cultures and the juxtaposition of difference as much as he extolled the great achievements of the welfare states of northern Europe. He was, all his life, a committed socialist; the iniquities of Thatcherism and the antics of New Labour only served to confirm these beliefs.</p> <p>In 1998, Taylor returned to the University of Durham as principal of Van Mildert College, a position in which he took great pastoral delight and satisfaction.

      "body": "<p>Henck Arron, who has died aged 64, was the former prime minister of Suriname, a slab of Amazonian jungle and coastal swamp on the northeast shoulder of South America. He was also one of that dwindling band of politicians who led their countries to independence in the latter half of the 20th century.</p> <p>In Arron's case, the colonists were the Dutch, who were not sorry to see the back of the territory. They won sovereignty over Suriname in 1667, at the same time as they lost New York; even though it became the world's biggest producer of bauxite, it proved to be poor compensation.</p> <p>The colonial authorities established a plantation economy based on African slavery, which the Netherlands was the last European nation to abolish. The freed slaves were later replaced by indentured labourers, first from India, then from Indonesia, producing an ethnic jigsaw puzzle which complicated the post-independence task of unification.</p> <p>Two-thirds of the population, of less than 500,000, is split between the majority Africans and Hindustanis, while the Javanese make up about 15%. Maroons - the descendants of escaped slaves, known in Suriname as \"Bush Negroes\" - constitute around 10%, and the native Amerindians 2.5%.</p> <p>Political affiliation has historically been based mainly on race; Arron's loyalty was to the Creole (Afro-Surinamese) National party of Suriname (NPS), which he joined in 1961. Born in the capital, Paramaribo, he obtained a banking degree in the Netherlands, and worked for the Amsterdamse Bank before returning to Suriname. In 1963, he was elected to parliament.</p> <p>Arron took over the NPS leadership in 1970, remaining its chairman for 23 years. He led the party to victory in the 1973 elections and, as prime minister, opened independence talks with the Dutch government, even though the idea was unpopular with the electorate and had not been mentioned in his manifesto.</p> <p>The NPS was influenced by Caribbean black power ideas, and the conservative Progressive Reform party (VHP), mainly identified with the Indian community, feared a re-run of events in neighbouring Guyana, where independence from Britain had been followed by authoritarian Afro-Guyanese rule. There were even fears of civil war in Suriname. But the Arron/NPS line prevailed; the VHP reconciled itself to independence, and the prime minister took the credit for a substantial aid package agreed with the Hague.</p> <p>Independence was not, however, an unalloyed blessing; politics degenerated further into ethnic polarisation and corruption, with the NPS using Dutch aid money for partisan purposes. Its leaders were accused of fraud in the 1977 elections, in which Arron won a further term, and the discontent was such that a large chunk of the population fled to the Netherlands.</p> <p>So when some army NCOs, led by Master-Sergeant Desi Bouterse, overthrew the government in 1980, there were few protests. The soldiers, veterans of the Dutch army, resented the fact that they were not allowed to belong to a union. They had not originally intended to seize power; \"We wanted a union and we got a nation,\" one of them remarked.</p> <p>It was Arron himself who had insisted, despite Dutch reluctance, that Suriname needed an army. \"He was rather vain,\" said a foreign businessman who knew him. \"He wanted a guard of honour at the airport when he came home from overseas trips.\"</p> <p>So, paradoxically, in 1980 Arron was accused of corruption and jailed by the very military he had created. He bore the ill-treatment and humiliation with courage; the charges did not stick, he was released in 1981, and, a year later, became managing director of the Surinaamse Volkskredietbank.</p> <p>Under Bouterse, conditions went from bad to worse. The Netherlands cut off aid in protest at his execution of 15 civilian opponents in 1982, and, in 1986, a Maroon insurgency broke out, led by former Bouterse bodyguard Ronnie Brunswijk. When the military were eventually compelled, under pressure from abroad, to hand back power in 1987, Arron - who had resumed the NPS leadership in 1985, when the army relaxed a ban on political activity - became vice-president and prime minister of a coalition government.</p> <p>On Christmas Eve 1990, in the so-called \"telephone coup\", Bouterse's men again told the civilian government to pack its bags. This time, formal military rule was more rapidly ended, although Bouterse remains immensely influential and wealthy. Arron, meanwhile, had retired from politics. Officially, it was due to deteriorating health following heart surgery; in reality, he was elbowed aside by the current president, Ronald Venetiaan.</p> <p>Arron is survived by his wife, Netty Arron-Leeuwin, and a mistress.</p> <p>Henck Alphonsus Eug\u00e8ne Arron, politician, born April 25 1936; died December 4 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Henck Arron, who has died aged 64, was the former prime minister of Suriname, a slab of Amazonian jungle and coastal swamp on the northeast shoulder of South America. He was also one of that dwindling band of politicians who led their countries to independence in the latter half of the 20th century. In Arron's case, the colonists were the Dutch, who were not sorry to see the back of the territory. They won sovereignty over Suriname in 1667, at the same time as they lost New York; even though it became the world's biggest producer of bauxite, it proved to be poor compensation. The colonial authorities established a plantation economy based on African slavery, which the Netherlands was the last European nation to abolish. The freed slaves were later replaced by indentured labourers, first from India, then from Indonesia, producing an ethnic jigsaw puzzle which complicated the post-independence task of unification. Two-thirds of the population, of less than 500,000, is split between the majority Africans and Hindustanis, while the Javanese make up about 15%. Maroons - the descendants of escaped slaves, known in Suriname as \"Bush Negroes\" - constitute around 10%, and the native Amerindians 2.5%. Political affiliation has historically been based mainly on race; Arron's loyalty was to the Creole (Afro-Surinamese) National party of Suriname (NPS), which he joined in 1961. Born in the capital, Paramaribo, he obtained a banking degree in the Netherlands, and worked for the Amsterdamse Bank before returning to Suriname. In 1963, he was elected to parliament. Arron took over the NPS leadership in 1970, remaining its chairman for 23 years. He led the party to victory in the 1973 elections and, as prime minister, opened independence talks with the Dutch government, even though the idea was unpopular with the electorate and had not been mentioned in his manifesto. The NPS was influenced by Caribbean black power ideas, and the conservative Progressive Reform party (VHP), mainly identified with the Indian community, feared a re-run of events in neighbouring Guyana, where independence from Britain had been followed by authoritarian Afro-Guyanese rule. There were even fears of civil war in Suriname. But the Arron/NPS line prevailed; the VHP reconciled itself to independence, and the prime minister took the credit for a substantial aid package agreed with the Hague. Independence was not, however, an unalloyed blessing; politics degenerated further into ethnic polarisation and corruption, with the NPS using Dutch aid money for partisan purposes. Its leaders were accused of fraud in the 1977 elections, in which Arron won a further term, and the discontent was such that a large chunk of the population fled to the Netherlands. So when some army NCOs, led by Master-Sergeant Desi Bouterse, overthrew the government in 1980, there were few protests. The soldiers, veterans of the Dutch army, resented the fact that they were not allowed to belong to a union. They had not originally intended to seize power; \"We wanted a union and we got a nation,\" one of them remarked. It was Arron himself who had insisted, despite Dutch reluctance, that Suriname needed an army. \"He was rather vain,\" said a foreign businessman who knew him. \"He wanted a guard of honour at the airport when he came home from overseas trips.\" So, paradoxically, in 1980 Arron was accused of corruption and jailed by the very military he had created. He bore the ill-treatment and humiliation with courage; the charges did not stick, he was released in 1981, and, a year later, became managing director of the Surinaamse Volkskredietbank. Under Bouterse, conditions went from bad to worse. The Netherlands cut off aid in protest at his execution of 15 civilian opponents in 1982, and, in 1986, a Maroon insurgency broke out, led by former Bouterse bodyguard Ronnie Brunswijk. When the military were eventually compelled, under pressure from abroad, to hand back power in 1987, Arron - who had resumed the NPS leadership in 1985, when the army relaxed a ban on political activity - became vice-president and prime minister of a coalition government. On Christmas Eve 1990, in the so-called \"telephone coup\", Bouterse's men again told the civilian government to pack its bags. This time, formal military rule was more rapidly ended, although Bouterse remains immensely influential and wealthy. Arron, meanwhile, had retired from politics. Officially, it was due to deteriorating health following heart surgery; in reality, he was elbowed aside by the current president, Ronald Venetiaan. Arron is survived by his wife, Netty Arron-Leeuwin, and a mistress. Henck Alphonsus Eug\u00e8ne Arron, politician, born April 25 1936; died December 4 2000",

Clinicians were specifically asked to report any chronic disease that set in after the jab. In Dr Wakefield's original study of 12 children published in the Lancet in 1998, the average onset of autism was given as 6.3 days after the injection. \"Cases of autism in association with bowel disease would certainly have been detected,\" she said. </p> <p>But Dr Wakefield and his inflammatory bowel diseases study group at the Royal Free believe they are piecing together a jigsaw.

The Norwegian scientist Kalle Reichelt in the 1980s found an excess of opioid peptides, which occur naturally in bread, milk and other foods, in the central nervous system of autistic children. </p> <p>Paul Shattock, director of the Autism Research Unit at Sunderland University, says that changing the diets of autistic children by removing glutens, for instance, can bring about improvements. \"We're slowly producing evidence that what parents have said for years about diet is true,\" he said. But his unit finds it hard to get funding to carry out research on the scale and to a standard that the medical establishment would accept. </p> <p>\"Our work is considered flaky,\" he said. \"It is not popular with the medical establishment.

      "body": "<p> A new scheme for pre-school children and their parents is getting under way in Plymouth, with the aim of helping parents of young children with severe behavioural difficulties to change not only their children's behaviour, but also their own. </p> <p>The idea of equipping young children with the learning and behavioural skills necessary to get a good start in school obviously goes down well with the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE). </p> <p>But while the Plymouth scheme operates in the local education action zone, and is done in collaboration with educational psychologists, nursery and playschool staff, its work is heavily based on the home visiting model for pre-school children known as \"portage\". And although the DfEE acknowledges portage in its curriculum guidance for pre-schoolers, portage services, as a general rule, receive very little official or public attention. </p> <p>Portage, which derives its name from its origins in the US state of Wisconsin, aims to support the development of play, communication, relationships, learning and participation of young children within the family. The focus of the work is on children who have learning disabilities, physical disabilities or communication difficulties, or other substantial and complex needs. Portage workers are often teachers, health visitors and nurses who have undergone specialist training to equip them to work alongside parents, offering practical help and ideas to encourage a child's emerging skills and to address problematic situations. </p> <p>About 140 portage services are registered with the National Portage Association (NPA), which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Last year, some 5,500 young children received regular home visits, while more were assisted by staff in the context of places like playgroups and nursery classes in schools. </p> <p>Nobody, including the DfEE, really knows how many children (and their often desperate parents) could benefit from the proven successes of these services. </p> <p>The 1987 disability surveys by the former Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys, which remain the most recent large-scale source of information, suggested that some 77,000 under-fives had problems with intellectual functioning, communication or behaviour.

      "bodyText": "A new scheme for pre-school children and their parents is getting under way in Plymouth, with the aim of helping parents of young children with severe behavioural difficulties to change not only their children's behaviour, but also their own. The idea of equipping young children with the learning and behavioural skills necessary to get a good start in school obviously goes down well with the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE). But while the Plymouth scheme operates in the local education action zone, and is done in collaboration with educational psychologists, nursery and playschool staff, its work is heavily based on the home visiting model for pre-school children known as \"portage\". And although the DfEE acknowledges portage in its curriculum guidance for pre-schoolers, portage services, as a general rule, receive very little official or public attention. Portage, which derives its name from its origins in the US state of Wisconsin, aims to support the development of play, communication, relationships, learning and participation of young children within the family. The focus of the work is on children who have learning disabilities, physical disabilities or communication difficulties, or other substantial and complex needs. Portage workers are often teachers, health visitors and nurses who have undergone specialist training to equip them to work alongside parents, offering practical help and ideas to encourage a child's emerging skills and to address problematic situations. About 140 portage services are registered with the National Portage Association (NPA), which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Last year, some 5,500 young children received regular home visits, while more were assisted by staff in the context of places like playgroups and nursery classes in schools. Nobody, including the DfEE, really knows how many children (and their often desperate parents) could benefit from the proven successes of these services. The 1987 disability surveys by the former Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys, which remain the most recent large-scale source of information, suggested that some 77,000 under-fives had problems with intellectual functioning, communication or behaviour. However, what is clear is that there are not enough portage services, and that most of them do not have sufficient or sufficiently secure financial resources to meet the level of need. \"Waiting lists are horrendous in some parts of the country,\" says Rosemary Gardener, who collates the NPA's statistics. Similarly, there appears to be a lack of clarity about where portage fits into pre-school support, because the schemes are sometimes based within education authorities' early years services and sometimes bracketed with psychology, special education or education learning support services.

Fleming, a 47-year-old Yorkshireman, has dramatically raised the profile of Tyne and Wear in almost 10 years as boss. In particular, his championing of social inclusion as an essential museum function has helped change the thinking on what a museum's role should be. </p> <p>\"I see museums as being in the service of society, not just as the preservers of a collection of objects,\" he says. \"I do believe Tyne and Wear has set the new agenda in the past few years and has helped people reassess what museums can do. We are relatively poorly funded, but money doesn't become a huge barrier to this kind of work because social inclusion is quite simply a fundamental issue. Lack of money is often used as an excuse in the cultural sector, but lack of commitment in the first place is often a much bigger problem.\" </p> <p>Social inclusion does not detract from a museum's curatorial role, he insists. \"People who say that don't know what they're talking about, quite frankly. Social inclusion has been happening for years, but with this government we have finally got support for it. It's scaremongering to say it puts the objects at risk.\" </p> <p>Fleming's roots are in working-class Leeds. He studied history at Leeds University, following it with a PhD in urban history at Leicester, and entered museums as a researcher after a disappointing spell in teaching. </p> <p>\"I was interested in adult education as a historian and taught Workers' Educational Association classes for a while, but found myself teaching middle-class housewives,\" he says. \"It was the same with the Open University - I was introducing educated people to more study, whereas I was looking for people who had been denied educational opportunity, as that was my family background. I felt that museums were a particularly accessible source of education for people who had had a traditional working-class education - that is, they'd left school young.\" </p> <p>It was at Hull in 1985, where he helped establish a social history museum in a former grammar school building, that his ideas took hold. \"The idea of looking at community history was a novelty in universities and museums at that time, but my research had been edging towards those areas and there were a few people coming through at the same time as me who were interested in that kind of thing. With the grammar school, there was the opportunity to create a people's history of Hull and to design a place that would appeal to excluded audiences.\" </p> <p>As director at Tyne and Wear, he now controls more than 200 staff in 10 museums and galleries, which together attract 1.2m visitors a year. His first change, on taking up the post in 1991, was to devote more resources to education, with education staff given the responsibility of setting up positive action and access programmes. </p> <p>One of his boldest moves was to rename Newcastle's Museum of Science and Engineering as the Discovery Museum - \"much less anal in terms of describing what it's about\", as he puts it. The Discovery's annual visitor figures have since risen from 40,000 to 250,000. </p> <p>Fleming is one of only two museum service bosses in local authorities in England to retain the title of director and the executive independence that goes with it. Many believe that is a sign of how highly he is regarded by the five authorities that make up Tyne and Wear. </p> <p>He says the absorption of museums into heritage or leisure divisions in other authorities is a mark of how their status in local government has declined over the years, partly as a result of restructuring but also, he thinks, because museums under-sell themselves. One of the aims of the Group for Large Local Authority Museums, which he helped found, is to promote the work of these unsung services. </p> <p>His relationship with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is also strong. A funding quirk means the department contributes some \u00a31m to the Tyne and Wear budget, but Fleming also offers strong backing for culture secretary Chris Smith. Interestingly, Fleming still sees himself as a socialist - \"to me it means identifying local needs and doing something about them\" - so the synergy with New Labour is not total and, as president of the Museums Association, he represents a broad church - not only local authority museums, but independents too. </p> <p>After a decade in Newcastle, the logical promotion for Fleming now would be to one of those prestigious national jobs. He just missed out on the directorship of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, but the forthcoming vacancy for director at the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside is reckoned by many to have his name on it. </p> <p>\"There's a view that running big national museums is more difficult than running a local authority service like Tyne and Wear,\" he says. \"But it's not a view that I share.\"</p>",

Many believe that is a sign of how highly he is regarded by the five authorities that make up Tyne and Wear. He says the absorption of museums into heritage or leisure divisions in other authorities is a mark of how their status in local government has declined over the years, partly as a result of restructuring but also, he thinks, because museums under-sell themselves. One of the aims of the Group for Large Local Authority Museums, which he helped found, is to promote the work of these unsung services. His relationship with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is also strong. A funding quirk means the department contributes some \u00a31m to the Tyne and Wear budget, but Fleming also offers strong backing for culture secretary Chris Smith. Interestingly, Fleming still sees himself as a socialist - \"to me it means identifying local needs and doing something about them\" - so the synergy with New Labour is not total and, as president of the Museums Association, he represents a broad church - not only local authority museums, but independents too. After a decade in Newcastle, the logical promotion for Fleming now would be to one of those prestigious national jobs. He just missed out on the directorship of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, but the forthcoming vacancy for director at the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside is reckoned by many to have his name on it. \"There's a view that running big national museums is more difficult than running a local authority service like Tyne and Wear,\" he says. \"But it's not a view that I share.\"",

It is, moreover, a model whose provenance is unknown; one for which no empirical research has been published; and one which even the university whose name it bears knows of only anecdotally. </p> <p>This is the \"Bradford factor\", a system for differentiating longer, infrequent staff absences from those which are more frequent, but of shorter duration. The assumption behind it is that high frequency, short duration absences are more problematic in certain types of organisation, are symptomatic of different problems and require separate identification in order to be addressed. </p> <p>Used strategically, to compare departments or groups of professionals or even whole workforces, Bradford is theoretically presumed to identify problems within management itself, or in the body of the workforce, before they become insurmountable. In practice, though, it is widely deployed at a tactical or individual level by departmental or human resources managers, for whom it can acquire a talismanic resonance. </p> <p>This is certainly how the system is perceived by some staff at Wakefield and Pontefract Community Health trust, in West Yorkshire. The trust requires that care staff who have suffered a viral infection should be symptom-free for four days before they return to work. The requirement is widely ignored by staff who frequently fail even to take time off to recover from the symptoms. They fear the effect of such absences on their Bradford profiles. </p> <p>A person having a few days off, to recover from a cold, might very well find themselves sending their Bradford score through the roof. They might consequently find themselves incurring the attention of their human resources or occupational health department, for whom a particular Bradford score triggers further action, perhaps disciplinary. Understandably, then, some staff members tend not to go sick in the first place. </p> <p>The trust's director of human resources, Alan Davis, is adamant that no action is taken purely on the basis of an adverse Bradford score and that it is merely a management information tool. He says: \"Bradford is not an absolute measure. It is one of a number of indicators used by us to provide managers with an understanding of absence among their staff. It is not intended to be a trigger for particular courses of action.\" </p> <p>Davis is surprised to hear that staff are suspicious and fearful of the technique. He believes that their unions are happy with its use and recognise that the trust has paid great attention to occupational health matters. </p> <p>\"If someone has a particular health concern, they can take it to our confidential staff counselling service, which operates on a self-referral basis, or they can discuss matters with their manager,\" he says. \"We also put great efforts into rehabilitation of members of staff from long-term sickness.\" </p> <p>Like many, Davis thinks the system originated at Bradford University. \"One of my staff came across it while doing some research and it appeared to be credited to the university,\" he says. \"We have now been using it for about four years.\" </p> <p>In one recent case, a care assistant at the Wakefield trust, who had been absent sick on six occasions for a total of five weeks in a rolling year, registering a Bradford score of 900, was interviewed by two members of management and subsequently received a letter. Headed \"Absenteeism/sickness absence\", the letter's tone is unmistakable. After recording the specifics of the interview, it reads: \"I must point out that while I am sympathetic with your difficulties... if there is no improvement in your attendance, consideration will be given to your suitability to continue in your present employment.\" </p> <p>According to Mary Maguire, spokeswoman for public services union Unison, the union's national negotiators are unaware of the Bradford factor. But she says: \"Unison accepts that in any organisation there are going to be one or two lead-swingers, but line managers should be able to identify those. We feel that, in a civilised society, we should take steps to find out remedial rather than punitive steps to resolve sickness issues.\" </p> <p>Bradford is implicitly discriminatory, she says. \"By focusing on short-term absence, it is bound to discriminate against women and older workers. By coercing people to come back to work when ill, it is creating a situation in which sick workers are treating sick patients.\" </p> <p>Geoff Helliwell, an occupational health physician and medical director of WellWork, a consultancy, identifies this as a distinct problem in its own right. \"People who are actually ill attending work, because they feel obliged to do so, is a form of 'presenteeism',\" he says. \"It is bad for their own long-term health, bad for those they work with and bad, ultimately, for the organisation. It can arise out of misinformed use of absence scoring such as the Bradford factor.\" </p> <p>Helliwell also feels that, as a means of reducing sickness absence, Bradford is wrongly focused. \"An organisation seeking to reduce its sickness absence ought to be focusing on the long-term rate of absence,\" he says. \"It has a choice: it can spend all its time, using tools like Bradford and running around after absences of one week or less, which form 35% of all spells of absence, or it can focus on the 3.9% of spells of four weeks or more which cause 48% of time lost.\" </p> <p>Mike O'Donnell, also an occupational health doctor, is broadly a supporter of Bradford. He feels that short-term absenteeism is a problem that needs addressing and which, if unremedied, leads to long-term absence. But he agrees that the disciplinary overtones attached to some uses of Bradford are counter-productive. </p> <p>\"Bradford is an analysis tool; it should not be used as a disciplinary one and occupational health departments should not be used as enforcers,\" says O'Donnell, of Medical and Industrial Services, another consultancy. \"However, short-term absence is a problem and as it may be one which relates to subsequent long-term absence, Bradford scores are of use in predicting this, as well as in highlighting managerial problems.\" </p> <p>Helliwell recommends that organisations using Bradford to focus on short-term absence rates should ask themselves what has happened to their overall rates as a result. Neither Davis, nor his staff at Wakefield, were able to provide figures for changes to short-term, long-term or overall absence in the four years they have been using the system.</p>",

The bank, it seems, is looking at whether there is a role for it to play in assisting agribusiness programmes in the developing world which the CEOs apparently presented as \"the second green revolution.\" Heard that one before. Incidentally, the only reason anyone got to know about the meeting was because it was accidentally sent out on the internet. </p>",

So Nick Raysnford MP, perhaps the least \"green\" environment minister since the late Nicholas Ridley, did indeed urge MPs to vote down plans to give energy efficiency advice to home-buyers - as predicted here last week. Dear Nick. This does not look good. Indeed, following your spectacular delaying of improvements to the energy efficiency building regulations, it looks spooky. Was it really you who won Tony Blair's support for Balfour Beatty's building of the Ilisu dam? Secret out on the net Good to see the biotech industry keeping up the pressure on politicians and global bodies. All the top chaps spent yesterday at the House of Commons presenting their case on animal testing and intellectual property to MPs and select committee members. Meanwhile, the CEOs of the world's 13 largest GM companies - including Monsanto, Aventis, Dow, Cargill and DuPont - have been secretly meeting James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank. The bank, it seems, is looking at whether there is a role for it to play in assisting agribusiness programmes in the developing world which the CEOs apparently presented as \"the second green revolution.\" Heard that one before. Incidentally, the only reason anyone got to know about the meeting was because it was accidentally sent out on the internet.",

      "body": "<p>It is 5.30pm. The bottle store is closed and young men are watching an Arnold Schwarzenegger video in a khaki army tent that is hot as an oven. Women walk listlessly across the vast, dusty compound of the semi-refugee camp at Smidtsdrift in South Africa, where 4,000 !XU and Khwe San bushmen and their families have waited over 10 years for resettlement (the exclamation mark before names is another letter in their alphabet which produces a clicking sound). </p> <p>Only children seem to be interested as, like latterday vaudevillians, we set up the projector, screen and generator near a large thorn tree for an open air screening of The Great Dance - a feature documentary about !Xo San bushman hunters who live several hundred miles north, in the heart of the Kalahari desert. </p> <p>Earlier in the day, Meita Gooi, a tiny chisel-cheeked bushman grandmother had announced the screening on the local radio station K-X Radio. \"This film made my heart sore,\" her voice wavers. \"It reminded me of the old life. It is about people like us, about our race and it made us proud.\" </p> <p>Meita and husband Piet, had been so moved by the film at an informal screening in Cape Town, that they asked the film-makers if they could take it home to show their families. </p> <p>The tented camp, known as Mahongo - \"place of suffering\" - is a depressing pit-stop on the way. Stunted trees give no relief from the blinding midday sun or the wind blowing through the camp, pirouetting in dramatic \"wind devils\" - mini tornadoes - which send dust, paper, plastic bags high into the air. Nothing much happens here. </p> <p>On a tiny fire in the centre of Katoti's tent, a weak soup with a rotting fish head is cooking. It has been a long time since her family has had meat. </p> <p>But it used not to be like that. Back in Namibia, her husband Peza had been a renowned hunter. \"He hunted eland, kudu, buffalo and would bring meat to the whole village,\" she says. \"But there is nothing here: no animals to hunt, no fruit to eat, no water, no wood or grass. There is only air to live on. Sometimes God brings you a good dream, sometimes he brings you a bad dream. This is a bad dream.\" </p> <p>The last 350 years in southern Africa has been devastating for the San. In that time they have been pushed off their land, hunted with guns, forced to work on white farms and prevented from speaking their languages. It is remarkable they have survived at all. </p> <p>And it has been at least two decades since these San bushmen, former trackers with the South African Defence Force from Namibia and Angola, have lived as hunter-gatherers. The teenagers wear baseball caps and trainers, want education and computers, while many of the older men, frustrated by loss of land and animals, drink themselves into a stupor. </p> <p>Last year, The Great Dance swept the awards at Wildscreen 2000, winning three Pandas, the equivalent of Oscars in the natural history world, and beating off competition from David Attenborough and Walking with Dinosaurs. In New York it was highly acclaimed by the critics and in South Africa it became the most popular feature documentary after Bueno Vista Social Club. </p> <p>Co-directors Craig and Damon Foster, two South African brothers, filmed in the central Kalahari on and off for two years, travelling 50kms a day through the bush in temperatures of over 45C for a month at a time, returning to Cape Town, skeletal and dehydrated. </p> <p>Their aim was to capture footage of the mythic San \"chasing hunt\" when, if poison runs out in the dry season, master hunters chase down their prey until the animal collapses from sheer exhaustion - running for hours in the midday heat, when (in the words of the San), the sand \"burns like a second sun.\" </p> <p>The brothers knew they were filming a lifestyle under huge pressure but had underestimated the wealth of knowledge still alive to this generation. \"They have an understanding of the natural world which would confound the greatest western scientists. They feel and see the bush in a way that we could hardly grasp, reading signs invisible to our eyes and hardened sensibilities,\" says Craig. </p> <p>\"Each tiny mark in the sand tells a story. They carry the weather of the last two weeks in their heads alongside an enormous understanding of tracks and animal behaviour. These skills take at least 25 years to master.\" </p> <p>The Fosters took early cuts of the film back to the hunters who helped them edit the footage and even gave them the idea to put miniature cameras on to the animals to best show what they are feeling as they hunt. \"They explained how eventually they become the mind of their prey, how they feel the stripe of a gemsbok on their cheeks, the prickle of animal sweat on their limbs and the trickle of blood on their ribs before they make a kill. Their hunting relies not on their weapons but on their uncanny ability to divine the animal's movements and the mood of the winds. It is like a sixth sense to them,\" says Craig. </p> <p>\"We had no idea how important hunting was to their culture until we began filming,\" says Craig. \"They told us that even if the animals disappeared they would still hunt, for it is about them feeling the land, being in nature, divining the weather. It is a spiritual experience as much as it is to do with finding meat.\" </p> <p>But how would the film go down at Mahongo? There the audience has long since given up hope of being able to hunt again. We are worried that no one will come, but Meita Gooi's plea across the airwaves has worked. As daylight fades, the screen flickers over the captivated faces of at least 2,000 men, women and children sitting in the cooling sand. </p> <p>They are visibly captivated as they watch !Nqate Karoha and Xlhoase move through the bush. They yelp in amazement at the unfurling of a giant centipede and gasp at the footage of cheetahs and snakes and, unused to film editing which compresses cooking time, howl with laughter when the hunters eat their prey. </p> <p> The young men's faces glow in some half forgotten recognition when the chasing hunt sequence sees Karoha chasing a kudu to its death. The audience goes wild in their appreciation. </p> <p>\"The San is born to be a hunter and yet I have no right to hunt,\" says Peza Dela. The Great Dance has reminded him of his impotence. \"If I do not hunt then I am no longer a San, it is in our blood. I must hunt. If you take away this right, you are trying to kill me slowly.\" </p> <p>The next day Peza takes us to his tent, strips to a threadbare thong, grabs a bow and arrow and speeds out into the blinding sun. Much to the amusement of his wife and their young grandchildren, he runs helter-skelter around the neighbours' tents before heading for the thorny scrub beyond, bringing the bow to his shoulder and letting an arrow fly in a spinning arc to thud uselessly into the ground a good 100 metres away. </p> <p>Trotting back to camp, as lithe at 68 as a dancer half his age, Peza grins in delight at his impromptu display. \"That film woke my spirit up. It has been a long time since I have been able to hunt. For years I have been trying to hide from my spirit. Now I must go back to Namibia and hunt my last eland to make the spirit of my grandfather happy.\" </p> <p>He may never do it. Six months after filming ended, all the individual hunting licences of the !Xo San were removed. If they are today caught hunting without a permit they risk jail and heavy fines. </p> <p>Craig is appalled: \"This is devastating for them. For the San, hunting is as important as breathing - it is a vital part of their culture, linked to story-telling and dancing, their relationship with the animals, the insects, the weather and the land - and their ancestors who have hunted this land for 30,000 years.\" </p> <p>\u0095 For further information and pictures of The Great Dance see <a href=\"http://www.senseafrica.com\">www.senseafrica.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It is 5.30pm. The bottle store is closed and young men are watching an Arnold Schwarzenegger video in a khaki army tent that is hot as an oven. Women walk listlessly across the vast, dusty compound of the semi-refugee camp at Smidtsdrift in South Africa, where 4,000 !XU and Khwe San bushmen and their families have waited over 10 years for resettlement (the exclamation mark before names is another letter in their alphabet which produces a clicking sound). Only children seem to be interested as, like latterday vaudevillians, we set up the projector, screen and generator near a large thorn tree for an open air screening of The Great Dance - a feature documentary about !Xo San bushman hunters who live several hundred miles north, in the heart of the Kalahari desert. Earlier in the day, Meita Gooi, a tiny chisel-cheeked bushman grandmother had announced the screening on the local radio station K-X Radio. \"This film made my heart sore,\" her voice wavers. \"It reminded me of the old life. It is about people like us, about our race and it made us proud.\" Meita and husband Piet, had been so moved by the film at an informal screening in Cape Town, that they asked the film-makers if they could take it home to show their families. The tented camp, known as Mahongo - \"place of suffering\" - is a depressing pit-stop on the way. Stunted trees give no relief from the blinding midday sun or the wind blowing through the camp, pirouetting in dramatic \"wind devils\" - mini tornadoes - which send dust, paper, plastic bags high into the air. Nothing much happens here. On a tiny fire in the centre of Katoti's tent, a weak soup with a rotting fish head is cooking. It has been a long time since her family has had meat. But it used not to be like that. Back in Namibia, her husband Peza had been a renowned hunter. \"He hunted eland, kudu, buffalo and would bring meat to the whole village,\" she says. \"But there is nothing here: no animals to hunt, no fruit to eat, no water, no wood or grass. There is only air to live on. Sometimes God brings you a good dream, sometimes he brings you a bad dream. This is a bad dream.\" The last 350 years in southern Africa has been devastating for the San. In that time they have been pushed off their land, hunted with guns, forced to work on white farms and prevented from speaking their languages. It is remarkable they have survived at all. And it has been at least two decades since these San bushmen, former trackers with the South African Defence Force from Namibia and Angola, have lived as hunter-gatherers. The teenagers wear baseball caps and trainers, want education and computers, while many of the older men, frustrated by loss of land and animals, drink themselves into a stupor. Last year, The Great Dance swept the awards at Wildscreen 2000, winning three Pandas, the equivalent of Oscars in the natural history world, and beating off competition from David Attenborough and Walking with Dinosaurs. In New York it was highly acclaimed by the critics and in South Africa it became the most popular feature documentary after Bueno Vista Social Club. Co-directors Craig and Damon Foster, two South African brothers, filmed in the central Kalahari on and off for two years, travelling 50kms a day through the bush in temperatures of over 45C for a month at a time, returning to Cape Town, skeletal and dehydrated. Their aim was to capture footage of the mythic San \"chasing hunt\" when, if poison runs out in the dry season, master hunters chase down their prey until the animal collapses from sheer exhaustion - running for hours in the midday heat, when (in the words of the San), the sand \"burns like a second sun.\" The brothers knew they were filming a lifestyle under huge pressure but had underestimated the wealth of knowledge still alive to this generation. \"They have an understanding of the natural world which would confound the greatest western scientists. They feel and see the bush in a way that we could hardly grasp, reading signs invisible to our eyes and hardened sensibilities,\" says Craig. \"Each tiny mark in the sand tells a story. They carry the weather of the last two weeks in their heads alongside an enormous understanding of tracks and animal behaviour. These skills take at least 25 years to master.\" The Fosters took early cuts of the film back to the hunters who helped them edit the footage and even gave them the idea to put miniature cameras on to the animals to best show what they are feeling as they hunt. \"They explained how eventually they become the mind of their prey, how they feel the stripe of a gemsbok on their cheeks, the prickle of animal sweat on their limbs and the trickle of blood on their ribs before they make a kill. Their hunting relies not on their weapons but on their uncanny ability to divine the animal's movements and the mood of the winds. It is like a sixth sense to them,\" says Craig. \"We had no idea how important hunting was to their culture until we began filming,\" says Craig. \"They told us that even if the animals disappeared they would still hunt, for it is about them feeling the land, being in nature, divining the weather. It is a spiritual experience as much as it is to do with finding meat.\" But how would the film go down at Mahongo? There the audience has long since given up hope of being able to hunt again. We are worried that no one will come, but Meita Gooi's plea across the airwaves has worked. As daylight fades, the screen flickers over the captivated faces of at least 2,000 men, women and children sitting in the cooling sand. They are visibly captivated as they watch !Nqate Karoha and Xlhoase move through the bush. They yelp in amazement at the unfurling of a giant centipede and gasp at the footage of cheetahs and snakes and, unused to film editing which compresses cooking time, howl with laughter when the hunters eat their prey. The young men's faces glow in some half forgotten recognition when the chasing hunt sequence sees Karoha chasing a kudu to its death. The audience goes wild in their appreciation. \"The San is born to be a hunter and yet I have no right to hunt,\" says Peza Dela. The Great Dance has reminded him of his impotence. \"If I do not hunt then I am no longer a San, it is in our blood. I must hunt. If you take away this right, you are trying to kill me slowly.\" The next day Peza takes us to his tent, strips to a threadbare thong, grabs a bow and arrow and speeds out into the blinding sun. Much to the amusement of his wife and their young grandchildren, he runs helter-skelter around the neighbours' tents before heading for the thorny scrub beyond, bringing the bow to his shoulder and letting an arrow fly in a spinning arc to thud uselessly into the ground a good 100 metres away. Trotting back to camp, as lithe at 68 as a dancer half his age, Peza grins in delight at his impromptu display. \"That film woke my spirit up. It has been a long time since I have been able to hunt. For years I have been trying to hide from my spirit. Now I must go back to Namibia and hunt my last eland to make the spirit of my grandfather happy.\" He may never do it. Six months after filming ended, all the individual hunting licences of the !Xo San were removed. If they are today caught hunting without a permit they risk jail and heavy fines. Craig is appalled: \"This is devastating for them. For the San, hunting is as important as breathing - it is a vital part of their culture, linked to story-telling and dancing, their relationship with the animals, the insects, the weather and the land - and their ancestors who have hunted this land for 30,000 years.\" \u0095 For further information and pictures of The Great Dance see www.senseafrica.com",

Lots of tangled red tape to be hacked through - and lots of misunderstanding about the legal complexities involved in reversing the trends of the past 40 years. </p> <p>\"There is a chance for market towns to reinvent themselves as vibrant places where people live in the centre,\" says freelance planner Ann Petherick, who founded Lots in 1989 with a three-year grant from the Rowntree Foundation. Apart from anything else, she points out, it makes sense to use vacant space and relieve development pressure on greenfield sites. \"Everyone wants this to happen,\" she goes on. \"That includes central government, local government, housing associations, landlords, leaseholders, would-be tenants and the police. But everyone has such diverse interests that they won't get together. It won't happen without a national agency to fit together a very complex jigsaw.\" </p> <p>Throughout its 12-year existence, Lots has been frustrated by a lack of consistent funding. Petherick is hopeful that her programme will be taken up nationally by regional development agencies. In the meantime, she's praying that, at a meeting tomorrow, the countryside agency for Yorkshire and Humberside will renew its grant to fund a continuing pilot project in eight of the region's towns. Thirsk is one of them. </p> <p>The shop which Motor World abandoned is unlikely to remain empty for long. Retailers are queuing up to take out a lease on what is, after all, a prime site overlooking a handsome cobbled market place.

The manager lived over the shop and the regular customers included the local vet, Alf Wight, who was better known to the wider world as James Herriot. Thirsk is the real-life Darrowby. But much has changed here since the days when Wight was grappling with Yorkshire porkers. </p> <p>While agriculture has been decimated, the town's economy has benefited from Herriot-inspired tourism and a thriving industrial estate which houses some hi-tech companies as well as the national headquarters of Austin Reed. In other words, this is not one of those small towns that young adults necessarily have to leave in order to find work. </p> <p>\"We need those youngsters to stay in Thirsk or to return here after they've finished university,\" says the mayor, Freda Roberts. Petherick nods assent. She is convinced that there will be no lack of demand for decent flats in the middle of town, available to rent at around \u00a3300 a month. </p> <p>\"There's a gap in the market,\" she says, \"for young people who want to stay in the town where they were born. They can't afford the rents in Leeds or York. They have no money to put down on a Barratt's home, yet they're not poor enough to qualify for social housing.\" </p> <p>Already she has her eyes set across the market place on the even larger space going begging above the Co-op supermarket. But here the frustrations of Lots's role becomes all too evident. Dealing with the freeholder of the former Motor World shop was comparatively easy because he is a local man, Bill Rukin. But around 80% of retail property is owned by absentee landlords.

Under its terms, housing associations deal directly with tenants, leaving the freehold landlords to negotiate with the shopkeepers who lease their premises. \"Everybody gains and nobody loses,\" says Petherick. \"The landlord gets a much-improved property and the leaseholder is no longer responsible for paying insurance and rates on the upstairs part of the building.\" </p> <p>Simple, you might think.

      "body": "<p>Despite 17 years' experience as a civil engineer, a lengthy list of qualifications and a portfolio of work for several international companies, Ahmed Shiraly has been unemployed for almost a year in the West Midlands, a region crying out for people with his skills. He is about to have an interview for the position of site engineer with a construction company - his seventh job interview in the past few months, after more than 30 applications. </p> <p>The obstacle to employment for Shiraly (not his real name) is that he is an asylum seeker - just one of an estimated 11,000 in the West Midlands whose skills could contribute to the regeneration of the region. The challenge of making refugees like him employable is a central theme of a Europe-wide conference taking place tomorrow and Friday in Birmingham, hosted by the Midland Refugee Council (MRC) with the Scottish and Welsh refugee councils. </p> <p>The conference, entitled Dispersal Not Disposal, will concentrate on how to get professional refugees into employment in the regions. It will seek to spread initiatives that conference organiser David Forbes hopes will make a thing of the past the idea that \"economic migrants are wicked\". </p> <p>Since the launch of the government's dispersal scheme last April, official figures suggest that almost 700 asylum seekers have been dispersed to the West Midlands - although Forbes says the actual number is much higher. The focus on the \"burden\" of asylum seekers and refugees, as they struggle to gain access to decent housing, healthcare and legal advice, has obscured how they could benefit the economy. </p> <p>In contrast to London, where the national Refugee Council has a well-established employment and training section which has been running for more than 10 years, areas outside the south-east are having to mobilise fast to avoid wasting asylum seekers' valuable labour skills. </p> <p>Work towards this goal includes a Birmingham-based project, Skills Match, which started in 1998 with the aim of getting professionally qualified refugees into employment. Co-funded by the European Union's integration of refugees budget, the project has worked with about 250 refugees and asylum seekers from more than 30 countries. </p> <p>Almost 40 of these have got jobs through the scheme, but Forbes, the project's manager, says only a dozen or so have found employment commensurate with their professional level. \"This demotion is the biggest problem for qualified asylum seekers,\" he says. \"In my experience, the odd-job man can get cash jobs with little problem, but professional barriers prevent people such as lawyers and teachers getting work.\" </p> <p>Professional qualifications are either not recognised or devalued, so much of the work of Skills Match concentrates on requalifying refugees in their particular field. </p> <p>Saeed Hassan Ali, a freelance television cameraman in his native Somalia, has been working as a bus driver in Birmingham. He has recently registered with the project and is exploring what additional video and media courses he needs to take to secure TV work in Britain. </p> <p>\"Our society is more interested in appearance than substance,\" says Forbes. \"We've got people who have got the substance - and not the appearance.\" </p> <p>Shiraly, an Iraqi, has learnt this the hard way. He was granted permission to work within six months of arriving in Britain, though he is still waiting for his first asylum application interview. One company offered him a post after two job interviews and after agreeing a salary of \u00a322,000. However, when he produced his Home Office papers stating that he was entitled to work, the company took one look at the large warning statement therein - \"You are a person who is likely to be detained\" - and withdrew its offer. </p> <p>\"I told them that it was routine and asked them to ring my solicitor who could explain,\" Shiraly says. \"They were polite, but that was the end of it. I was very depressed and so disappointed.\" </p> <p>The rejection delivered a particularly hard blow since, with the help of Skills Match, Shiraly had studied intensively for a relevant City and Guilds qualification, had support from a mentor, had an excellent reference and had reconstructed professional drawings of his past work from memory. He believes that the threat of detention in his papers has also given some employers the idea he is exploitable. One company offered him a job that had been advertised at a salary of \u00a318,000, on the understanding that he would be paid \u00a35 an hour. He refused. </p> <p>Forbes, focusing on what he calls \"institutional barriers\", has worked to develop a mentoring scheme whereby doctors, engineers, lawyers and architects in the West Midlands, attached to professional bodies, introduce refugees in their field to the British system and guide them towards employment through what is often a complicated, confusing wall of bureaucracy. Skills Match is currently seeking mentors in accountancy and to develop contacts in pharmacy and architecture. </p> <p>Alongside mentoring, more than 40 refugees have completed work placements in solicitors' offices, at the Arts Council, with Channel 4 and in libraries. About the same number have been advised or financially assisted in academic or professional requalification. Through the Electrical Contractors' Association and the sector's joint industry board, an Iranian refugee and one from the Ukraine were able to requalify as electricians at Wolverhampton University. </p> <p>Most progress has been made in the medical field through the setting up of the Midland Refugee Doctors' Group, which has the backing of a Birmingham-based senior consultant, Edwin Borman. </p> <p>\"The UK damn well needs lots of doctors,\" says Borman. \"We have a shortfall of 4,000 even after the promised government increase. Just a few refugee doctors have got through the incredibly complicated and bureaucratic system. We want it to be possible for more people, not just the rare exceptions, to be employed.\" </p> <p>Six refugee medics met the director of Birmingham's medical school which resulted in three of them obtaining clinical attachments. After successfully passing the required English language exams, and gaining the qualifications necessary to register with the General Medical Council, one of them - Waleed Rashid, from Kurdistan - has been appointed senior house officer in public health in Dudley. </p> <p>Rashid says that, aside from the financial support that Skills Match provided for exam fees, the help he received in \"understanding the system\" was indispensable. \"Even English people within these professional bodies didn't necessarily know the answer to my detailed questions,\" he says. \"The scheme helped me to be determined.\" </p> <p> <strong>The shortage list</strong><br></p> <p> Tell a joke about how, in Britain, there are more engineers working in McDonald's than in construction, and most employers are unlikely to spilt their sides. Business and industry are pressing the government to relax the rules on asylum seekers' freedom to work. </p> <p>For the first six months after an asylum seeker enters the country, they are unable to take employment. After that period, they may apply for a work permit. </p> <p>Almost three-quarters of British companies are suffering skills shortages, according to a recent survey by recruitment group Reed. Compared to six months previously, there has been a 26% increase in the number of employers unable to recruit essential staff, forcing thousands to look overseas for recruits. </p> <p>Liz Fekete, head of European research at the Institute of Race Relations, says the pressure on governments is Europe-wide. \"In Germany, in Ireland and here, the business community is saying: 'Relax the rules.'\" </p> <p>Fekete points to Ireland, where the Dublin chamber of commerce has called for asylum seekers to be processed quicker in order to help fill the city's 20,000 job vacancies. </p> <p>As in Britain, however, there are fierce objections among the general public about relaxing controls. An opinion poll last year found that while 60% of Irish voters agreed that a more generous approach should be taken towards refugees, particularly in view of the country's history of emigration and its current prosperity, almost three-quarters of voters wanted strict limits on the numbers allowed in. </p> <p>Fekete argues that in their first six months in Britain, asylum seekers should at least be able to do voluntary work. \"The government should invest in their skills in the first instance, and then they could make a positive contribution,\" she says. \"But with the way things stand, they're being left to rot.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Despite 17 years' experience as a civil engineer, a lengthy list of qualifications and a portfolio of work for several international companies, Ahmed Shiraly has been unemployed for almost a year in the West Midlands, a region crying out for people with his skills. He is about to have an interview for the position of site engineer with a construction company - his seventh job interview in the past few months, after more than 30 applications. The obstacle to employment for Shiraly (not his real name) is that he is an asylum seeker - just one of an estimated 11,000 in the West Midlands whose skills could contribute to the regeneration of the region. The challenge of making refugees like him employable is a central theme of a Europe-wide conference taking place tomorrow and Friday in Birmingham, hosted by the Midland Refugee Council (MRC) with the Scottish and Welsh refugee councils. The conference, entitled Dispersal Not Disposal, will concentrate on how to get professional refugees into employment in the regions. It will seek to spread initiatives that conference organiser David Forbes hopes will make a thing of the past the idea that \"economic migrants are wicked\". Since the launch of the government's dispersal scheme last April, official figures suggest that almost 700 asylum seekers have been dispersed to the West Midlands - although Forbes says the actual number is much higher. The focus on the \"burden\" of asylum seekers and refugees, as they struggle to gain access to decent housing, healthcare and legal advice, has obscured how they could benefit the economy. In contrast to London, where the national Refugee Council has a well-established employment and training section which has been running for more than 10 years, areas outside the south-east are having to mobilise fast to avoid wasting asylum seekers' valuable labour skills. Work towards this goal includes a Birmingham-based project, Skills Match, which started in 1998 with the aim of getting professionally qualified refugees into employment. Co-funded by the European Union's integration of refugees budget, the project has worked with about 250 refugees and asylum seekers from more than 30 countries. Almost 40 of these have got jobs through the scheme, but Forbes, the project's manager, says only a dozen or so have found employment commensurate with their professional level. \"This demotion is the biggest problem for qualified asylum seekers,\" he says. \"In my experience, the odd-job man can get cash jobs with little problem, but professional barriers prevent people such as lawyers and teachers getting work.\" Professional qualifications are either not recognised or devalued, so much of the work of Skills Match concentrates on requalifying refugees in their particular field. Saeed Hassan Ali, a freelance television cameraman in his native Somalia, has been working as a bus driver in Birmingham. He has recently registered with the project and is exploring what additional video and media courses he needs to take to secure TV work in Britain. \"Our society is more interested in appearance than substance,\" says Forbes. \"We've got people who have got the substance - and not the appearance.\" Shiraly, an Iraqi, has learnt this the hard way. He was granted permission to work within six months of arriving in Britain, though he is still waiting for his first asylum application interview. One company offered him a post after two job interviews and after agreeing a salary of \u00a322,000. However, when he produced his Home Office papers stating that he was entitled to work, the company took one look at the large warning statement therein - \"You are a person who is likely to be detained\" - and withdrew its offer. \"I told them that it was routine and asked them to ring my solicitor who could explain,\" Shiraly says. \"They were polite, but that was the end of it. I was very depressed and so disappointed.\" The rejection delivered a particularly hard blow since, with the help of Skills Match, Shiraly had studied intensively for a relevant City and Guilds qualification, had support from a mentor, had an excellent reference and had reconstructed professional drawings of his past work from memory. He believes that the threat of detention in his papers has also given some employers the idea he is exploitable. One company offered him a job that had been advertised at a salary of \u00a318,000, on the understanding that he would be paid \u00a35 an hour. He refused. Forbes, focusing on what he calls \"institutional barriers\", has worked to develop a mentoring scheme whereby doctors, engineers, lawyers and architects in the West Midlands, attached to professional bodies, introduce refugees in their field to the British system and guide them towards employment through what is often a complicated, confusing wall of bureaucracy. Skills Match is currently seeking mentors in accountancy and to develop contacts in pharmacy and architecture. Alongside mentoring, more than 40 refugees have completed work placements in solicitors' offices, at the Arts Council, with Channel 4 and in libraries. About the same number have been advised or financially assisted in academic or professional requalification. Through the Electrical Contractors' Association and the sector's joint industry board, an Iranian refugee and one from the Ukraine were able to requalify as electricians at Wolverhampton University. Most progress has been made in the medical field through the setting up of the Midland Refugee Doctors' Group, which has the backing of a Birmingham-based senior consultant, Edwin Borman. \"The UK damn well needs lots of doctors,\" says Borman. \"We have a shortfall of 4,000 even after the promised government increase. Just a few refugee doctors have got through the incredibly complicated and bureaucratic system. We want it to be possible for more people, not just the rare exceptions, to be employed.\" Six refugee medics met the director of Birmingham's medical school which resulted in three of them obtaining clinical attachments. After successfully passing the required English language exams, and gaining the qualifications necessary to register with the General Medical Council, one of them - Waleed Rashid, from Kurdistan - has been appointed senior house officer in public health in Dudley. Rashid says that, aside from the financial support that Skills Match provided for exam fees, the help he received in \"understanding the system\" was indispensable. \"Even English people within these professional bodies didn't necessarily know the answer to my detailed questions,\" he says. \"The scheme helped me to be determined.\" The shortage list Tell a joke about how, in Britain, there are more engineers working in McDonald's than in construction, and most employers are unlikely to spilt their sides. Business and industry are pressing the government to relax the rules on asylum seekers' freedom to work. For the first six months after an asylum seeker enters the country, they are unable to take employment. After that period, they may apply for a work permit. Almost three-quarters of British companies are suffering skills shortages, according to a recent survey by recruitment group Reed. Compared to six months previously, there has been a 26% increase in the number of employers unable to recruit essential staff, forcing thousands to look overseas for recruits. Liz Fekete, head of European research at the Institute of Race Relations, says the pressure on governments is Europe-wide. \"In Germany, in Ireland and here, the business community is saying: 'Relax the rules.'\" Fekete points to Ireland, where the Dublin chamber of commerce has called for asylum seekers to be processed quicker in order to help fill the city's 20,000 job vacancies. As in Britain, however, there are fierce objections among the general public about relaxing controls. An opinion poll last year found that while 60% of Irish voters agreed that a more generous approach should be taken towards refugees, particularly in view of the country's history of emigration and its current prosperity, almost three-quarters of voters wanted strict limits on the numbers allowed in. Fekete argues that in their first six months in Britain, asylum seekers should at least be able to do voluntary work. \"The government should invest in their skills in the first instance, and then they could make a positive contribution,\" she says. \"But with the way things stand, they're being left to rot.\"",

      "body": "<p>A plan to exclude one in five disabled people who volunteer for the New Deal, and put them in a control group, has met fierce criticism from disability groups which are calling on the goverment to abandon the idea. </p> <p>Concern is running so high that leading disability charities may reconsider their involvement in the New Deal for disabled people, which will be extended nationally from July with introduction of a national \"job broker\" scheme. </p> <p>Under the plan, brokers from the voluntary or private sectors will provide support, guidance and preparation to volunteer jobseekers from among the 2.5m people who claim incapacity benefit. </p> <p>To measure the scheme's success, the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) plans to assess what would have otherwise happened, using random assignment to do so. Under this method, 20% of volunteers will be allocated to a control group which will be excluded from the scheme for at least a year, but will receive benefits. </p> <p>A DfEE spokesman says that individuals in the control group will be told \"that their eligibility will be deferred\". However, details of exactly how the control group will be determined, and at what stage people will be informed, have yet to be decided. \"We're speaking to evaluation experts and organisations for and on behalf of disabled people.\" </p> <p>The extensive way in which the government intends to use random assignment, compared to what has happened elsewhere in the New Deal, has caused disability groups to question the moral and practical implications. The New Deal for young people used the method for just one week only in certain parts of the country. In the New Deal for people over 25, it was used in only two of the 28 pilot areas. </p> <p>Steve Winyard, head of public policy at the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB), says he first became aware of the plan last November when the chief executives of seven charities met Margaret Hodge, minister for disabled people, social security minister Hugh Bayley and health minister John Hutton. \"All the chief executives expressed concern from the start,\" says Winyard. \"The system is very objectionable. It's treating disabled people like guinea pigs and will be seen by them to be highly discriminatory.\" </p> <p>The job broker scheme should be available to every disabled person who wants it, Winyard says. Government refusal to back down woud leave the RNIB facing \"a lot of soul searching\" about whether to continue to take part as a job broker. </p> <p>Brian Lamb, director of policy research at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, says: \"This is potentially demotivating for disabled people who will effectively be cut loose from a scheme they wanted to benefit from.\" </p> <p>As well as deterring potential brokers, including his own charity, random assignment might affect how disabled people behaved towards the scheme. \"On all these grounds we're very unhappy with what appears to be a very unhelpful, Treasury-imposed approach,\" says Lamb. </p> <p>John Knight, head of policy at Leonard Cheshire, another top disability charity, says that while his organisation welcomes all government initiatives to help disabled people into employment, use of random assignment is unacceptable. There is little difference between the approach and giving extra funding only to four out of five schools, Knight says. \"The outcry from parents would be enormous. Such a move would be politically unthinkable and morally indefensible. So why is it acceptable to use it with disabled people?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A plan to exclude one in five disabled people who volunteer for the New Deal, and put them in a control group, has met fierce criticism from disability groups which are calling on the goverment to abandon the idea. Concern is running so high that leading disability charities may reconsider their involvement in the New Deal for disabled people, which will be extended nationally from July with introduction of a national \"job broker\" scheme. Under the plan, brokers from the voluntary or private sectors will provide support, guidance and preparation to volunteer jobseekers from among the 2.5m people who claim incapacity benefit. To measure the scheme's success, the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) plans to assess what would have otherwise happened, using random assignment to do so. Under this method, 20% of volunteers will be allocated to a control group which will be excluded from the scheme for at least a year, but will receive benefits. A DfEE spokesman says that individuals in the control group will be told \"that their eligibility will be deferred\". However, details of exactly how the control group will be determined, and at what stage people will be informed, have yet to be decided. \"We're speaking to evaluation experts and organisations for and on behalf of disabled people.\" The extensive way in which the government intends to use random assignment, compared to what has happened elsewhere in the New Deal, has caused disability groups to question the moral and practical implications. The New Deal for young people used the method for just one week only in certain parts of the country. In the New Deal for people over 25, it was used in only two of the 28 pilot areas. Steve Winyard, head of public policy at the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB), says he first became aware of the plan last November when the chief executives of seven charities met Margaret Hodge, minister for disabled people, social security minister Hugh Bayley and health minister John Hutton. \"All the chief executives expressed concern from the start,\" says Winyard. \"The system is very objectionable. It's treating disabled people like guinea pigs and will be seen by them to be highly discriminatory.\" The job broker scheme should be available to every disabled person who wants it, Winyard says. Government refusal to back down woud leave the RNIB facing \"a lot of soul searching\" about whether to continue to take part as a job broker. Brian Lamb, director of policy research at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, says: \"This is potentially demotivating for disabled people who will effectively be cut loose from a scheme they wanted to benefit from.\" As well as deterring potential brokers, including his own charity, random assignment might affect how disabled people behaved towards the scheme. \"On all these grounds we're very unhappy with what appears to be a very unhelpful, Treasury-imposed approach,\" says Lamb. John Knight, head of policy at Leonard Cheshire, another top disability charity, says that while his organisation welcomes all government initiatives to help disabled people into employment, use of random assignment is unacceptable. There is little difference between the approach and giving extra funding only to four out of five schools, Knight says. \"The outcry from parents would be enormous. Such a move would be politically unthinkable and morally indefensible. So why is it acceptable to use it with disabled people?\"",

      "body": "<p>It's 18 months since the launch of a tough, high-profile local police operation tagged Excalibur. But a tenants' representative in Higher Openshaw, east Manchester, concedes: \"It's the youth club as much as Excalibur that's reduced crime round here.\" She had previously been one of the strongest advocates of the police offensive in an atmosphere where talk of youth clubs would have been seen as rewarding \"the scum\". </p> <p>This particular scum are the Sandywell lads, whose joyriding made life hell for local residents, young and old. The youth club is Higher Openshaw Youth, set up by parents frustrated by public meetings where they never got an answer to questions about youth provision. </p> <p>With the help of a voluntary sector organiser, and the headmaster of Higher Openshaw community school, the parents turned a large classroom into a club, with PlayStations, computers, a tuck bar and use of the football pitch. On two evenings a week, it was open to everyone between the ages of 12 and 25. After six months or so, the Sandywell lads started turning up, mainly to play football, use the PlayStations and have somewhere warm to hang out. \"We're neutral,\" says Louis, one of the club organisers. \"When they come they don't bring in the problems they have outside.\" </p> <p>Crime and youth - treated as inseparable in government soundbites - is going to be a big issue in the general election. The prime minister is turning to his cabinet for manifesto ideas, but he might do better to listen to what is happening in inner-city neighbourhoods where a small number of government initiated experiments have given residents, voluntary groups and public agencies the powers to innovate. </p> <p>Higher Openshaw, a neighbourhood that was part of Manchester's former industrial heartland, is now part of one of the first of the government's New Deal for Communities (NDC) programmes. Here, a combination of extra money (a modest \u00a380m over 10 years for an area of 9,000 households), rising expectations and growing self-confidence among local people and voluntary groups, plus NDC staff with a brief to be innovative and accountable, is generating a complex new dynamic that challenges established government mechanisms. </p> <p>Questions are raised about what is really meant by \"community-led\" policymaking and \"best value\". At present, national best value targets measure youth provision primarily in terms of crime reduction: the wider importance of out-of-school opportunities for personal and social fulfilment is not prioritised. East Manchester's experience points to the importance of letting young people help shape the targets. </p> <p>As elsewhere, anxieties over crime have prompted a sharp response. In an initial survey of local residents' views, \"crime and fear of crime\" overwhelmingly predominated, and 70% of 800 respondents equated crime with youth crime. The newly-opened NDC office in the windswept Beswick precinct used its clout with local agencies, especially the police, to address these concerns. Operation Excalibur was one result, along with the issuing of an anti-social behaviour order against one local family, security cameras, new lighting and gates on alley ways, placed according to residents' instructions. </p> <p>This reaction forged a bond between the residents' groups and the NDC, but young people's needs are not necessarily represented through such groups. \"There can be unwillingness to talk to young people - they appear more intimidating than they are,\" says Judith Williams, of the Delamere and Toxteth Residents, which makes a special effort to work with young people. Aware of this, the NDC team built a commitment to a youth programme into its work from the outset. </p> <p>But NDC team leader Sean McGonigle is open about the imbalance. \"Tackling fear of crime was relatively easy,\" he says. \"But working with young people requires a lot more development. Not many people are good at it.\" </p> <p>An imaginative consultation with young people was organised, but the results languished on a shelf for a year, until a youth officer was appointed to follow them through. What do young people want? After a go-karting session at the former Parcelforce building in central Manchester, the Higher Openshaw youth divide into groups - the girls want to be separate from the lads - to discuss similar desires. </p> <p>\"A house - they could convert one of the boarded up ones - with sofas and music, warm and dry, with someone there so that there's no bullying or anything,\" say the girls. \"Something as big as this hall,\" say the boys. \"Did you see Big Brother? A house like that.\" They also want easier access to a modern leisure centre for the whole area. And they want to do something with cars: \"A BMX track; motor repair classes...\" </p> <p>One of the reasons why Higher Openshaw Youth is so popular, and unvandalised, is mutual respect. It's round the corner from their homes, more or less their own, but also looked after and comfortable. Volunteer organiser, Jeff Burns, a martial arts instructor, is strongly motivated by the belief that all young people have a right to their own space and facilities. \"If you come from the right area, you take it for granted,\" he says. \"Here, you miss out on all those opportunities to build up confidence, relate to people, realise your potential.\" </p> <p>Down at the new NDC offices, youth and community officer Alun Francis agrees. Home Office targets linking funds with crime prevention loom large, but he takes a broader view, emphasising the importance of youth provision for itself. \"Sanctions are important,\" he says, \"but so is the development of young people.\" </p> <p>He is strongly backed - indeed, pressured - in this direction by the local youth task group, which brings together many of those working with young people. The result is robust debate on how to combine law enforcement and crime prevention with meeting the needs of all young people in the area. Francis and the task group are coordinating a growing number of exciting youth projects to tackle the inequality that blights east Manchester. During the summer, they helped fund voluntary organisations and statutory workers to provide activities for every young person. They aim to do this every holiday and half-term. </p> <p>Plans are under way for a youth college, with an alternative curriculum and innovative support for disaffected young people. A \"motor project\" is being mooted, and the NDC is funding a general expansion of core youth provision throughout the community, with efforts to ensure that the character of such provision is shaped by young people themselves. The youth workers organising the consultations see it as their mission to eradicate all traces of what they call \"adultese\". Could youth houses become real? As real as the Commonwealth Games stadium at the end of the road? </p> <p>Yet those working with young people report a tension between these holistic aims and the more authoritarian themes in Home Office policy. \"Curfews on young offenders create obstacles to their involvement with the mentoring and inclusion work we are doing,\" says Viv Blow, from a local mentoring project part-funded by the NDC. \"We convince them to come, and then they have to go through the bureaucracy of getting permission. It puts them off.\" Blow also finds negative views towards young people are reinforced by a current political consensus associating youth with crime. </p> <p>Kath Byrne, manager of the nearby Crossley House youth centre, adds: \"The main problem for young people here is low self-esteem. We need people who will stand up for them publicly.\" </p> <p>At Grey Mare police station, Dave Jones has recently been appointed superintendent after being responsible for Greater Manchester's submission to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. His message to the Home Office is a measured request for politicalpronouncements which echo, rather than undermine, his attempts to build bridges. \"Fear of young people is like racism - based on ignorance,\" he says. \"The more residents speak to youngsters, the more they realise that perhaps it isn't just their fault. But this has to come right from the top.\" </p> <p>Glyn Williams, chair of Delamere and Toxteth Residents, says it more plainly: \"I've been a Labour man till now, but the cabinet ministers must come and listen to the kids and understand what they need.\" </p> <p>Young people need some quick wins. In a small part of east Manchester, they may be beginning to get them. As the general election draws near and populist soundbites proliferate, is the government prepared to learn from people such as Williams, and volunteers at Higher Openshaw Youth, and commit serious public resources to out of school provision for all young people? </p> <p> <strong>Falling short of expectations</strong></p> <p>David Brindle<br></p> <p> Is youth offending really on the increase, as many people and politicians appear to believe? The evidence is, at best, mixed. </p> <p>According to Home Office figures, the number of young people aged 10-17 found guilty of, or cautioned for, an indictable offence in England and Wales fell from 153,000 in 1988 to 127,000 in 1998. But this was up from 120,000 in 1997. </p> <p>Similarly, the number of those aged 18-20 convicted or cautioned fell from 94,000 in 1988 to 82,000 in 1996, but rose again to 91,000 in 1998. At age 21 or over, the number rose 14% between 1988 and 1998. </p> <p>Eighteen is the peak age for known offending among men, but among women it is 15. In 1995, a Home Office report concluded that young people who misused drugs or alcohol were likely to become \"embedded in a criminal lifestyle\". To divert them, it suggested, the criminal justice system should \"harness the more powerful sources of social control exercised by families, schools and neighbours\". </p> <p>The government's criminal justice and police bill, unveiled last week, aims to breathe new life into child curfew and anti-social behaviour orders that are widely seen to have fallen short of expectations.</p>",

But this was up from 120,000 in 1997. Similarly, the number of those aged 18-20 convicted or cautioned fell from 94,000 in 1988 to 82,000 in 1996, but rose again to 91,000 in 1998. At age 21 or over, the number rose 14% between 1988 and 1998. Eighteen is the peak age for known offending among men, but among women it is 15. In 1995, a Home Office report concluded that young people who misused drugs or alcohol were likely to become \"embedded in a criminal lifestyle\". To divert them, it suggested, the criminal justice system should \"harness the more powerful sources of social control exercised by families, schools and neighbours\". The government's criminal justice and police bill, unveiled last week, aims to breathe new life into child curfew and anti-social behaviour orders that are widely seen to have fallen short of expectations.",

All three programmes have common elements - not least their focus on small areas, and their aim of tackling problems in a coordinated way by addressing jobs, housing, crime, health and community resilience. </p> <p>Each sits alongside the context of last year's urban white paper that gave welcome recognition to the importance of rolling out good practice in the delivery of services and of bending main spending to reinforce the aim of local regeneration.</p> <p>There are some strong arguments for taking a neighbourhood approach. Small areas can quickly gain poor reputations. Whether they have any substance or not, they can critically affect a neighbourhood's fortunes and are often reinforced by media-generated images. </p> <p>There are powerful processes that can drive neighbourhoods into a downward spiral. We have long been aware of postcode discrimination - by employers, insurance companies and potential investors. Those who leave poor areas are usually in work and with the money to afford relocation, or those who can read the runes of how best to enhance the educational prospects for their children. </p> <p>What economists term \"negative externalities\" can apply at very small scales: an empty and abandoned house next door; a waste plot being used by drug dealers or prostitutes; graffiti on house walls; abandoned sofas in the street. All of these can start a rapid process of neighbourhood change that encourages stable households to leave and undermines confidence both by families and by institutional investors. It needs only a few \"problem families\" to be moved into an area, or only a few landlords to fill houses with \"welfare\" cases, to start this rapid process. </p> <p>Part of the negative spiral is linked to the increasing perception of council housing as a tenure of last resort, but as research has shown, the rot within small areas affects all tenures - registered social landlords and new private and housing association houses as much as council housing. </p> <p>The evidence of market collapse in house prices in small areas is striking - and frequently the areas with houses selling for less than \u00a310,000, hard-to-let stock and with massive problems of negative equity are cheek-by-jowl with areas of relatively stable housing markets.</p> <p>It is these local spirals that justify neighbourhood-based intervention. But there are questions about the neighbourhood focus. Most of the problems of small areas are a result of poverty and unemployment. Only if a neighbourhood and its people are connected back into the mainstream economy are its underlying difficulties likely to be ameliorated. </p> <p>This means the new neighbourhood initiatives will need to be strongly tied to the local strategic partnerships proposed in the white paper (and there remains uncertainty about their roles and the capacity of areas to develop the necessary local partnerships). </p> <p>Sub-regional economies are far from uniformly strong - it is far easier to re-connect neighbourhoods in east London into strong economies than those in Liverpool or Teesside. </p> <p>In the case of the neighbourhood management pilots, parachuting in these well paid, local managers may be a double-edged sword unless they have the powers and resources to deliver on what they might promise. Bypassing the neighbourhood champions that already exist in deprived areas, often middle-aged women, may be a recipe for local resentment as much as a solution to the need to strengthen neighbourhood and community ties and the quality of local services. Plausible champions tend to be locally bred not imported.</p> <p>It is encouraging to see the government beginning to translate into action the regeneration focus promised by the white paper, but at this stage the jury on neighbourhoods must still be out.</p>",

What economists term \"negative externalities\" can apply at very small scales: an empty and abandoned house next door; a waste plot being used by drug dealers or prostitutes; graffiti on house walls; abandoned sofas in the street. All of these can start a rapid process of neighbourhood change that encourages stable households to leave and undermines confidence both by families and by institutional investors. It needs only a few \"problem families\" to be moved into an area, or only a few landlords to fill houses with \"welfare\" cases, to start this rapid process. Part of the negative spiral is linked to the increasing perception of council housing as a tenure of last resort, but as research has shown, the rot within small areas affects all tenures - registered social landlords and new private and housing association houses as much as council housing. The evidence of market collapse in house prices in small areas is striking - and frequently the areas with houses selling for less than \u00a310,000, hard-to-let stock and with massive problems of negative equity are cheek-by-jowl with areas of relatively stable housing markets. It is these local spirals that justify neighbourhood-based intervention. But there are questions about the neighbourhood focus. Most of the problems of small areas are a result of poverty and unemployment. Only if a neighbourhood and its people are connected back into the mainstream economy are its underlying difficulties likely to be ameliorated. This means the new neighbourhood initiatives will need to be strongly tied to the local strategic partnerships proposed in the white paper (and there remains uncertainty about their roles and the capacity of areas to develop the necessary local partnerships). Sub-regional economies are far from uniformly strong - it is far easier to re-connect neighbourhoods in east London into strong economies than those in Liverpool or Teesside. In the case of the neighbourhood management pilots, parachuting in these well paid, local managers may be a double-edged sword unless they have the powers and resources to deliver on what they might promise. Bypassing the neighbourhood champions that already exist in deprived areas, often middle-aged women, may be a recipe for local resentment as much as a solution to the need to strengthen neighbourhood and community ties and the quality of local services. Plausible champions tend to be locally bred not imported. It is encouraging to see the government beginning to translate into action the regeneration focus promised by the white paper, but at this stage the jury on neighbourhoods must still be out.",

Palace are without influential defender Fan Zhiyi and Robbie Fowler comes in up front for Liverpool. Gerard Houllier's men are 5-1 on with Palace 10-1 against, but that still didn't stop one optimistic London punter placing \u00a35,000 on the Eagles.<br> <strong>2</strong> Fowler wins the first corner of the game; Gerard misses it, but Hyppia gets his head in to force a save. Fowler certainly eager to impress on this his first start in five games - so eager, he is immediately caught offside.<br> <strong>3</strong> Smicer finds space on the right and centres for McAllister to stroke the ball out left to Carragher. McAllister gets it back but Liverpool lose possession. Gerard lucky to get away with a kick at Rubins.<br> <strong>5</strong> All Liverpool so far. Murphy plays a one-two with Fowler on the edge of the area before forcing Palace's Latvian international keeper Kolinko down to his left with a shot.<br> <strong>6</strong> Palace rattle the home side with their first significant move upfield and win a corner. Comes to nothing although Palace do manage to keep the ball in the Liverpool half for almost a minute. Well done, boys.<br> <strong>9</strong> Solid defending by Smith to keep Fowler away from a long clearance by Gerard and thus deny a break.<br> <strong>10</strong> Kolinko does well in the Palace when he leaves his area to head the ball to safety.<br> <strong>13 GOAL: Liverpool 1 - 0 Palace</strong> Fowler on the half-way line finds Smicer wide on the right with a pinpoint pass.

Crystal Palace: Kolinko, Smith, Harrison, Austin, Thomson, Carlisle, Rubins, Rodger, Black, Forssell, Morrison. Subs: Gregg, Gray, Ruddock, Pollock, Kabba. Referee: P Durkin (Dorset) 1 Liverpool kick off this beautifully poised tie. Palace are without influential defender Fan Zhiyi and Robbie Fowler comes in up front for Liverpool. Gerard Houllier's men are 5-1 on with Palace 10-1 against, but that still didn't stop one optimistic London punter placing \u00a35,000 on the Eagles. 2 Fowler wins the first corner of the game; Gerard misses it, but Hyppia gets his head in to force a save. Fowler certainly eager to impress on this his first start in five games - so eager, he is immediately caught offside. 3 Smicer finds space on the right and centres for McAllister to stroke the ball out left to Carragher. McAllister gets it back but Liverpool lose possession. Gerard lucky to get away with a kick at Rubins. 5 All Liverpool so far. Murphy plays a one-two with Fowler on the edge of the area before forcing Palace's Latvian international keeper Kolinko down to his left with a shot. 6 Palace rattle the home side with their first significant move upfield and win a corner. Comes to nothing although Palace do manage to keep the ball in the Liverpool half for almost a minute. Well done, boys. 9 Solid defending by Smith to keep Fowler away from a long clearance by Gerard and thus deny a break. 10 Kolinko does well in the Palace when he leaves his area to head the ball to safety. 13 GOAL: Liverpool 1 - 0 Palace Fowler on the half-way line finds Smicer wide on the right with a pinpoint pass. Carlisle unable to keep up and Smicer has a free run into the Palace area before beating Kolinko at the far post with a right-foot shot. 15 GOAL: Liverpool 2 - 0 Palace Oh dear.

Westerveld spills first time but recovers before Forsell can pounce on the rebound. 23 McAllister just inches away from scoring Liverpool's fourth when he strikes the left-hand upright with a blistering shot. 26 That \u00a35,000 is looking dodgy - hard to see Palace pulling this one back, despite the optimism of the visiting fans who are singing, \"We're gonna win 4-3\". 30 Hyppia tries to find Murphy up front but the ball runs on to Kolinko. Palace's back line fail to notice the threat. 31 The match is starting to look like a training ground stroll for Liverpool.

Sloane, a murderous, bisexual thug, insinuates himself into the home and bed of the sexually infantile Kath while also attracting her gaily butch brother, Ed. He impregnates Kath, excites Ed by working as his leather-clad chauffeur and then brutally kicks their father to death. But the exploiter turns victim when Ed and Kath blackmail him into becoming their shared sexual slave. </p> <p>What makes the play shocking - and funny - is the formal decorum of Orton's language. Harold Hobson, in his original review, compared the play to Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, and it is precisely the Janeite contrast between the Gothic substance and the elevated style that gives the play its charge. When Kath famously says \"Until I was 15 I was more familiar with Africa than my own body\", or when Ed claims that it is his \"liberal principles\" that have led him to be foolishly protective, we are in a world where language is used as an elaborate masquerade. </p> <p>But the virtue of Johnson's production is that it exposes Orton's genuine heartlessness, and it does this by heightening the play's farcical quality. When Kath vamps the willing Sloane, she appears from behind swagged curtains to a Mario Lanza record like a downmarket Cleopatra; when Sloane attacks her in the final scene her dentures go flying across the room, only to be caught by Ed. Even if Kath is finally triumphant, there is no escaping the rancid misogyny behind Ed's line to his sister that \"you showed him the gate of Hell every night\". </p> <p>Johnson, in short, brings out the play's cold-hearted swagger. He is helped by a wonderfully over-the-top William Dudley set that, with its murky mural of swirling bodies, reminds one of the collage that decorated Orton's own room. And the performances tread a fine line between verbal comedy and physical farce. As Kath, Alison Steadman veers superbly between an affected gentility and a rank coarseness when the chips, and the trousers, are down. Clive Francis as Ed almost salivates at the prospect of a uniformed Sloane and captures exactly a certain kind of blazered, gay muscularity. Neil Stuke's Sloane is a ruthless blond predator who always sits with legs conveniently splayed. </p> <p>In the end, I find something slightly chilling about Orton's own amorality. But there is no denying his power as a comic stylist or the play's ability, even after all these years, to leave one pleasurably shocked. </p> <p> Until April 6. Box office: 020-7863 3334.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In these days of Erin Brockovich and John Grisham-inspired legal thrillers, we are beginning to grow accustomed to the idea that the individual crusader can sometimes win David-and-Goliath battles against Evil Corporations. </p> <p>So when the BBC confirmed this week that it has introduced a telephone hotline to encourage its 23,600 employees to inform on colleagues they suspect of behaving improperly, it seemed like another victory for whistleblowing: another example of how, following the introduction of the \"Whistleblowers' Act\", the 1998 Public Interest Disclosure Act, it really is easier now for workers to reveal corporate malpractice without fear. </p> <p>Cards bearing a 24-hour free phone number have been distributed among BBC staff; anyone who reports a workmate whom they suspect of taking bribes, fiddling expenses, harassment or health and safety breaches can now provide full details anonymously. </p> <p>The move is a timely one: a survey in this month's Management Today magazine reveals that 30% of senior managers have blown the whistle, while recent high-profile cases such as Stephen Bolsin, the anaesthetist at Bristol Royal Infirmary who spent five years trying to alert the authorities to unsatisfactory standards of paediatric heart surgery, have raised awareness about the devastating consequences of remaining silent. </p> <p>But if you see heinous acts of corruption going on under your nose every day, is an anonymous telephone helpline really going to expose the culprit without landing you in the dole queue? The answer is: not necessarily - particularly if the organisation you work for is using the services of a commercial call-handling company. </p> <p>The BBC has opted for Expolink, an outfit that offers similar \"snitch lines\" for 600,000 individuals worldwide, including several benefit fraud lines for local authorities in England and Wales. Its services don't come cheap: a quick glance at Expolink's charge sheet reveals that the cost for an organisation of the BBC's size is \u00a31,100 per month, with an additional 80p per employee for a \"welcome pack\", plus VAT. </p> <p>Which comes in at nearer \u00a340,000 - a pricey package considerably greater than the \u00a310,000 estimated by the BBC in news reports last weekend. </p> <p>Companies such as Expolink offer the same services as any call centre - specially trained staff available round the clock to read out a pre-rehearsed script. \"We're not a counselling service, we're not there to advise on what is or what is not the right course of action,\" says David Crook, the company's director. </p> <p>\"We're merely a channel of communication between the organisation and its workforce. Our phone people are trained to get as much information about the case as possible and then pass it on. That's the end of our involvement - it's then up to the BBC or whoever to take a view on how to investigate and resolve the matter. Even if it's a case of serious malpractice, we as the call handler have to be careful not to get drawn into the case.\" </p> <p>But can a hired call service really fulfil the spirit of a good whistleblow ing policy? \"It's very odd that the BBC has decided to go down this route,\" says Guy Dehn, director of Public Concern at Work, a charity providing free telephone advice to anyone contemplating whistleblowing. \"These call firms are nothing but glorified answering services, and they don't provide independent advice. How can they, since they are hired by the organisation's management?\" </p> <p>Dehn's organisation represents 450 NHS trusts, as well as private-sector firms, and was crucial in lobbying for a change in the law. The 1998 act means, in theory, that it much easier for workers to bring cases into the open: they can claim compensation if they are victimised for bringing a case, and can claim unfair dismissal if they lose their job. The ceiling on compensation has also been raised. </p> <p>But it doesn't always work out so well in practice. The BBC's decision to hire Expolink, Dehn argues, is at odds with government guidelines on standards in public life. \"The Nolan Committee made it clear that public bodies would be expected to provide, and authorise their staff to get, independent advice when they were concerned about a whistleblowing issue. The NHS follows this to the letter, so why can't the BBC? </p> <p>\"The spirit of the new BBC is meant to be all about openness and transparency, yet this move suggests that they won't practise what they preach. They're always attacking other organisations for being secretive, but now they're encouraging their workers not to speak out in public but to hide behind an answering machine. It's a classic case of sauce for the goose.\" </p> <p>The BBC rejects the charges. \"We want to make it easier for employees to communicate these issues and we feel this is the best way of doing it,\" says a spokesman. \"Anyway, why on earth would we need people to offer counselling or advice? The line is just for them to report malpractice.\" </p> <p>But specialists in the field argue that counselling is anything but irrelevant. \"Anyone who rings our helpline usually needs a lot of counselling about what their options are,\" says Dehn. \"We'd start off by asking them what they want to achieve by exposing the wrongdoing. It's certainly not always appropriate for them to take on their bosses, or even to take legal action. It depends whether what's at stake really is in the public interest, and it depends on individual circumstances. Someone rang the other day wanting to expose appalling standards in a care home. </p> <p>\"In that case, what they ended up doing was writing a pseudonymous article for Community Care magazine.\" The whole issue of anonymity is hugely risky. \"It's a question of access to information. In many organisations, if you blow the whistle, even if you do it anonymously, people will know who was responsible.\" </p> <p>Dehn cites the case of a firm in Liverpool, where an employee last year reported an incident to a telephone helpline. His contract was subsequently not renewed, and he took his case to tribunal. He won the case - but it was far more difficult to prove victimisation because he had made the complaint anonymously, and someone in the firm had guessed his identity. </p> <p>There is another, wider problem: whistleblowing has become a catch-all term, but as far as the law is concerned it applies only to the disclosure of information that is in the public interest - so the BBC's system, which will cover all complaints, expands the scope of the definition. </p> <p>Many employees do find themselves wanting to report conduct that does not fall within the letter of the law. One book editor, who wishes to remain anonymous, found herself in just such a scenario three months ago when she decided to speak out against a superior who was persistently harassing young women who came to their offices on work placement schemes. \"He was basically promising them full-time jobs if they would have sex with them,\" she explains. \"And then of course that would be the last we'd see of them. Since I told my boss, the culprit has been reprimanded, but now I still have to work alongside him and I'm sure he knows it was me who complained.\" </p> <p>The largest payment made to date under the new law has been to Toni Fernandes, an accountant with the Reading-based telecommunications firm Netcom. He was sacked for gross misconduct after faxing company directors in America to tell them how the firm's chief executive had claimed \u00a3371,000 in cash advances and expenses without receipts, following detective work that had involved reassembling shredded documents. Fernandes was awarded \u00a3293,441 compensation by an employment tribunal. </p> <p>But it is still the case that being branded a whistleblower does not exactly improve one's CV. \"Other employers may avoid people who make these claims,\" says Laurence Anstis, the lawyer who acted for Fernandes. \"They see them as troublemakers.\" Fernandes has not worked since the ruling.</p>",

So when the BBC confirmed this week that it has introduced a telephone hotline to encourage its 23,600 employees to inform on colleagues they suspect of behaving improperly, it seemed like another victory for whistleblowing: another example of how, following the introduction of the \"Whistleblowers' Act\", the 1998 Public Interest Disclosure Act, it really is easier now for workers to reveal corporate malpractice without fear. Cards bearing a 24-hour free phone number have been distributed among BBC staff; anyone who reports a workmate whom they suspect of taking bribes, fiddling expenses, harassment or health and safety breaches can now provide full details anonymously. The move is a timely one: a survey in this month's Management Today magazine reveals that 30% of senior managers have blown the whistle, while recent high-profile cases such as Stephen Bolsin, the anaesthetist at Bristol Royal Infirmary who spent five years trying to alert the authorities to unsatisfactory standards of paediatric heart surgery, have raised awareness about the devastating consequences of remaining silent. But if you see heinous acts of corruption going on under your nose every day, is an anonymous telephone helpline really going to expose the culprit without landing you in the dole queue? The answer is: not necessarily - particularly if the organisation you work for is using the services of a commercial call-handling company. The BBC has opted for Expolink, an outfit that offers similar \"snitch lines\" for 600,000 individuals worldwide, including several benefit fraud lines for local authorities in England and Wales. Its services don't come cheap: a quick glance at Expolink's charge sheet reveals that the cost for an organisation of the BBC's size is \u00a31,100 per month, with an additional 80p per employee for a \"welcome pack\", plus VAT. Which comes in at nearer \u00a340,000 - a pricey package considerably greater than the \u00a310,000 estimated by the BBC in news reports last weekend. Companies such as Expolink offer the same services as any call centre - specially trained staff available round the clock to read out a pre-rehearsed script. \"We're not a counselling service, we're not there to advise on what is or what is not the right course of action,\" says David Crook, the company's director. \"We're merely a channel of communication between the organisation and its workforce. Our phone people are trained to get as much information about the case as possible and then pass it on. That's the end of our involvement - it's then up to the BBC or whoever to take a view on how to investigate and resolve the matter. Even if it's a case of serious malpractice, we as the call handler have to be careful not to get drawn into the case.\" But can a hired call service really fulfil the spirit of a good whistleblow ing policy? \"It's very odd that the BBC has decided to go down this route,\" says Guy Dehn, director of Public Concern at Work, a charity providing free telephone advice to anyone contemplating whistleblowing. \"These call firms are nothing but glorified answering services, and they don't provide independent advice. How can they, since they are hired by the organisation's management?\" Dehn's organisation represents 450 NHS trusts, as well as private-sector firms, and was crucial in lobbying for a change in the law. The 1998 act means, in theory, that it much easier for workers to bring cases into the open: they can claim compensation if they are victimised for bringing a case, and can claim unfair dismissal if they lose their job. The ceiling on compensation has also been raised. But it doesn't always work out so well in practice. The BBC's decision to hire Expolink, Dehn argues, is at odds with government guidelines on standards in public life. \"The Nolan Committee made it clear that public bodies would be expected to provide, and authorise their staff to get, independent advice when they were concerned about a whistleblowing issue. The NHS follows this to the letter, so why can't the BBC? \"The spirit of the new BBC is meant to be all about openness and transparency, yet this move suggests that they won't practise what they preach. They're always attacking other organisations for being secretive, but now they're encouraging their workers not to speak out in public but to hide behind an answering machine. It's a classic case of sauce for the goose.\" The BBC rejects the charges. \"We want to make it easier for employees to communicate these issues and we feel this is the best way of doing it,\" says a spokesman. \"Anyway, why on earth would we need people to offer counselling or advice? The line is just for them to report malpractice.\" But specialists in the field argue that counselling is anything but irrelevant. \"Anyone who rings our helpline usually needs a lot of counselling about what their options are,\" says Dehn. \"We'd start off by asking them what they want to achieve by exposing the wrongdoing. It's certainly not always appropriate for them to take on their bosses, or even to take legal action. It depends whether what's at stake really is in the public interest, and it depends on individual circumstances. Someone rang the other day wanting to expose appalling standards in a care home. \"In that case, what they ended up doing was writing a pseudonymous article for Community Care magazine.\" The whole issue of anonymity is hugely risky. \"It's a question of access to information. In many organisations, if you blow the whistle, even if you do it anonymously, people will know who was responsible.\" Dehn cites the case of a firm in Liverpool, where an employee last year reported an incident to a telephone helpline. His contract was subsequently not renewed, and he took his case to tribunal. He won the case - but it was far more difficult to prove victimisation because he had made the complaint anonymously, and someone in the firm had guessed his identity. There is another, wider problem: whistleblowing has become a catch-all term, but as far as the law is concerned it applies only to the disclosure of information that is in the public interest - so the BBC's system, which will cover all complaints, expands the scope of the definition. Many employees do find themselves wanting to report conduct that does not fall within the letter of the law. One book editor, who wishes to remain anonymous, found herself in just such a scenario three months ago when she decided to speak out against a superior who was persistently harassing young women who came to their offices on work placement schemes. \"He was basically promising them full-time jobs if they would have sex with them,\" she explains. \"And then of course that would be the last we'd see of them. Since I told my boss, the culprit has been reprimanded, but now I still have to work alongside him and I'm sure he knows it was me who complained.\" The largest payment made to date under the new law has been to Toni Fernandes, an accountant with the Reading-based telecommunications firm Netcom. He was sacked for gross misconduct after faxing company directors in America to tell them how the firm's chief executive had claimed \u00a3371,000 in cash advances and expenses without receipts, following detective work that had involved reassembling shredded documents. Fernandes was awarded \u00a3293,441 compensation by an employment tribunal. But it is still the case that being branded a whistleblower does not exactly improve one's CV. \"Other employers may avoid people who make these claims,\" says Laurence Anstis, the lawyer who acted for Fernandes. \"They see them as troublemakers.\" Fernandes has not worked since the ruling.",

Among those expected to step down are Simon Robertson, a managing director of Goldman Sachs, and Nigel Sherlock, a director of stockbrokers Wise Speke. Ms Furse's new role, which is expected to be ratified by the LSE board this morning, caused some confusion in the City yesterday. One source described her as an \"obscure\" choice but an attempt by the exchange to show it was serious about change. The exchange has already undergone a painful demutualisation but is now said to need alliances or mergers with other exchanges after recently rebuffing an approach from US hi-tech market Nasdaq. But overall, a broking community that until recently appeared irreconcilably divided between the big banks and small firms, appeared to give her benefit of the doubt. Brian Winterflood, chairman of Winterflood, a broker of small stocks and one of the most vocal opponents of the exchange's management, said: \"The boys have made a mess of it, so why not let the girls have a go.\" Ms Furse is not of the traditional ilk for chief executives of the LSE, which has proved a poisoned chalice for the men drawn from the broking community. Her predecessor, Gavin Casey, resigned when OM launched its hostile bid last year. She was deputy chairman of London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange in the late 1990s, a period when LIFFE underwent a radical technological facelift. New technology is one of the main challenges for the LSE, an area she tackled at French-owned Credit Lyonnais Rouse, which she left a month ago. Of Dutch origin but born in Canada, Ms Furse speaks five languages. Her appointment means that the exchange's two most senior executives will have no direct experience of the elite world of buying and selling shares. Don Cruickshank, the often unpopular chairman who oversaw her appointment, is also an outsider. One survivor of the board room shake-out is expected to be Michael Marks, the veteran City broker at Merrill Lynch who bore the brunt of the accusations of the small brokers by pushing through decisions which favoured larger firms. \u0095OM, which reported 2000 earnings below expectations, has not ruled out another bid for the LSE later this year, possibly with other players.",
