Since the Middlesbrough defeat on Boxing Day, the only time Liverpool have finished on the losing side was in the first leg of their Worthington semi-final at Crystal Palace, a deficit emphatically recovered in the second leg. </p> <p>What happened between those two semi-final legs was that Jari Litmanen made a stunning debut in a 3-0 Premiership victory at Aston Villa. The Finn took the place of Robbie Fowler, whose own resurgence stems from precisely the same time.

'We look a lot more solid now.' </p> <p>Nick Barmby, one of the arrivals last summer, agrees Liverpool were never likely to make a flying start. 'When you have a number of new people they will always need time for bedding-in,' he said. 'People are saying that if the league was beginning now we might have a chance of staying with Manchester United. </p> <p>'The manager always says the time to judge us will be in a couple of years, but I think the Roma result showed we are strong mentally, and beating United at Old Trafford was a massive boost to our confidence.' </p> <p>Houllier might be right about judging Liverpool in two years, but he is equally well aware that if they don't start picking up silverware soon he might not be allowed that luxury. Anfield eyes might be on the FA Cup, the Uefa Cup and a Champions League place, but the Worthington Cup would be a start. 'I think the time has come to win something,' Houllier admitted. 'I'm sure Birmingham City will feel the same way for other reasons, but this is my first cup final and it's important to all of us. Winning silverware at this stage will increase our self-belief and set us up for the rest of the season.' </p> <p>'For the best teams winning is a habit,' Hamann said. 'We haven't got that habit yet, but we'd like to make a start. The size of our squad means players want to do well in every game, and we don't intend giving anything away cheaply. No one is underestimating this occasion, because perhaps the first trophy is always the most difficult. I joined Liverpool to win things and I'm just waiting to get off the mark.' </p> <p>Hamann has that in common with Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, then. But for the German's free-kick in what turned out to be Kevin Keegan's last match, the first foreign coach in English history might not have come about so quickly. 'Germany was not so surprised to see England appoint Eriksson. The situation is similar in Germany.

      "body": "<p>You can't rush the mountains if they don't want to play. On the first day the wind is blowing, snow falls and the surface is hard-packed ice beneath our skis. We slide down into a little copse of trees in a small valley. I fall over and dark clouds threaten from behind the mountain pass ahead. Time to head home for a cup of coffee. Twenty-four hours later and we are back climbing the valley on skis, zigzagging up a gentle slope among small stands of trees through a covering of soft powder and up towards the little gorge that will take us up into the mountains. This time the sky is blue, the air still, and the snow crystals sparkle beneath our skis. With a whir of wings a ptarmigan, white in its winter coat, bursts from a hidden nest beneath out feet, momentarily startling us. </p> <p>I've skied down glaciers in the dark, cross-country skied through gloomy, tangled Swedish woods, across passes and through the majestic forests of Canada. I've made day tours on Alpine touring skis, and skied into remote sheltering huts in winter to climb the neighbouring mountains. But for years I've wanted to try touring the Scandinavian way, on lightweight, free-heel skis, visiting one of Norway's famous touring huts. Finally I was here, climbing on waxed skis up into the mountains above the nearby resort of Hemsedal, the formidable Per Ola Seim my guide for the next two days. </p> <p>Half an hour later and we are over the first pass and in a wide, open valley with a frozen lake in its centre. This is the first of three stepped passes and a number of such lakes we will skate across, more or less gracefully in my case, on skis. On the gentler slopes leading up to each subsequent step we shuffle on the waxed bottoms of our skis as they grip the snow. On the steeper slopes we side step up laboriously in long zigzags. We do this for five hours, utterly alone in a pristine landscape that looks like a giant Cairngorms, until the last pass and a soul-destroying struggle up deep snow. Now the weather turns and we find ourselves hoods up and goggles on, pushing into the teeth of a blizzard. Then we see it: a vague shape at first, soon more obvious. It's a little house with a pitched roof, the touring hut at Bjordalsbu, and our home for the night. </p> <p>Norwegian Touring Association huts are like nowhere else I have ever stayed in the mountains.

Checking our avalanche transceivers, and with an admonition from Per to be quick off the mark with the shovel if the slope breaks off, he sets off first, telemarking through untracked, knee-deep powder. A few turns later, he indicates that it is safe to follow and I begin making my own turns, a combination of ordinary Alpine and telemark, dropping to each knee in turn for stability. A second section of downhill takes us to the largest frozen lake we have thus far encountered, a huge expanse of creaking white ice almost a kilometre in length, with deep cracks at the edges where the weight of the ice has collapsed on itself. We skate across it to the final descent of the trip down a long icy valley and through trees to the car. </p> <p>The Norwegians have a word for this kind of lark. It is, as Per explains, all to do with Den Norske Folkessela or the Norwegian folk spirit, the impetus to set off into the mountains for days - or weeks at a time in Per's case - skiing from hut to hut. Per and his friends take it even further, digging igloos and snow caves to live in during their trips. It even has a motto of a kind, which Per has painted on his skis: Intense Joy. This just about sums it up for me. Most, however, opt for well-prepared, waymarked trails that connect the network of mountain huts and lead over gentler terrain. </p> <p>You do not have to go off into the wilderness trekking for days to get a flavour of what this Norwegian folk spirit thing is all about. Skiing in Norway has a flavour all of its own. It is not just that the mountains are more rounded and more gentle (though no less wild than the Alps in bad weather). It is all to do with the way people go about having their winter fun. </p> <p>It is something you notice even on the drive up from the tiny airport: little groups of toddlers on their first skis by the road cross-country skiing with their parents. And on the pisted slopes of Hemsedal the free-heel skiers, using the telemark technique still popular in Norway and Sweden, are as much in evidence as skiers using Alpine skis with their fixed heels. All of which adds up to a kind of detuned and rather funky skiing experience. It is a fantastically friendly place to ski if you are on your own. I go skiing a lot on my own, so I'm used to picking up people to ski with at cable car stations and in bus queues. </p> <p>And of all the places I have visited, Norway is one of the friendliest. While it is good for beginners, people still ski hard, but without the scary intensity of a lot of the European resorts where you find yourself forever dodging would-be down-hill racers. The free creche at Hemsedal's ski centre, where you can park the munchkins while you ski, says it all. It is better equipped and better staffed than some nurseries you would find in Britain.</p>",

We slide down into a little copse of trees in a small valley. I fall over and dark clouds threaten from behind the mountain pass ahead. Time to head home for a cup of coffee. Twenty-four hours later and we are back climbing the valley on skis, zigzagging up a gentle slope among small stands of trees through a covering of soft powder and up towards the little gorge that will take us up into the mountains. This time the sky is blue, the air still, and the snow crystals sparkle beneath our skis. With a whir of wings a ptarmigan, white in its winter coat, bursts from a hidden nest beneath out feet, momentarily startling us. I've skied down glaciers in the dark, cross-country skied through gloomy, tangled Swedish woods, across passes and through the majestic forests of Canada. I've made day tours on Alpine touring skis, and skied into remote sheltering huts in winter to climb the neighbouring mountains. But for years I've wanted to try touring the Scandinavian way, on lightweight, free-heel skis, visiting one of Norway's famous touring huts. Finally I was here, climbing on waxed skis up into the mountains above the nearby resort of Hemsedal, the formidable Per Ola Seim my guide for the next two days. Half an hour later and we are over the first pass and in a wide, open valley with a frozen lake in its centre. This is the first of three stepped passes and a number of such lakes we will skate across, more or less gracefully in my case, on skis. On the gentler slopes leading up to each subsequent step we shuffle on the waxed bottoms of our skis as they grip the snow. On the steeper slopes we side step up laboriously in long zigzags. We do this for five hours, utterly alone in a pristine landscape that looks like a giant Cairngorms, until the last pass and a soul-destroying struggle up deep snow.

      "body": "<p><strong> What is meant by 'freestyle'?</strong> <br> Many of the formal rules of cruising have been thrown overboard. You can leave your jacket and tie at home if you wish. The evening dress code has been designated as 'resort casual' though, rather like a golf club, you are asked not to wear shorts or jeans in the main public areas in the evening. Dining at pre-assigned tables with strangers at one of two sittings has been abandoned. You can now eat in any of the restaurants between 5.30pm and midnight. Real slobs can wear what they like at night as they graze along the buffet in the informal caf\u00e9 on the pool deck. </p> <p> <strong> So it's goodbye to the captain's table?</strong> <br> Not exactly. We were invited to join Captain Haakon Gangdal (from Bergen) and his senior officers on the one formal night of our week on board. This followed the amiable captain's welcome party for all 2,000 guests spread over two decks on the three-storey atrium at the centre of the ship. But the formality is optional, with black tie or dark suit required in one restaurant. </p> <p> <strong> Do you really have a choice of restaurants?</strong> <br> Yes. You can turn up at any time from 5.30pm at the two main restaurants, the Four Seasons, where the captain hosted his table, or the Seven Seas. You can ask for a table for up to 10 friends and will probably be offered the chance to sit with other people. </p> <p> <strong> That sounds dreadful.</strong> <br> The maitre d' will give you a table for two if you ask. Besides, some passengers enjoy the social side of cruising. A retired couple from Bromley told me: 'We spend much more time together now than when we were working so we like to meet new people on holiday.' </p> <p> <strong> What are the options?</strong> <br> There are three smaller speciality restaurants which take bookings 36 hours in advance. Le Bistro serves a classic French menu in a candlelit setting on deck 12, while Ciao-Chow serves Asian 'fusion' food and pizzas in a more informal atmosphere. Our favourite was Horizons, which serves a modern Italian menu in a narrow room styled like the carriages of an Orient Express train. If you prefer to snack, you can enjoy excellent Spanish tapas in Gatsby's bar and some spicy Balinesian canap\u00e9s in the Observation Lounge. And the caf\u00e9 serves basic fare for the shorts and T-shirt brigade. </p> <p> <strong> There must be a drawback.</strong> <br> You pay a $10 a head surcharge for the three speciality restaurants, which mounts up if you prefer these more intimate settings. The menus remain the same all week, presumably to encourage you to eat around. And you may be asked to wait for a table at the 'free' main restaurants. An elderly couple from Cheltenham complained that they had to wait 15 minutes when they turned up at 8pm, the peak hour, at the Four Seasons. </p> <p> <strong> Couldn't they have had a drink at the bar?</strong> <br> I would have gone back to the champagne bar on deck six. But it does illustrate a point. Traditional cruise passengers are conservative by nature and may prefer the certainties of the more formal style. And there is an administrative problem, too. The two-sitting, banquet-style meals are easier to serve in the large restaurants. The chefs have to adjust to cooking to order and the waiting staff have to work to a different rhythm if the food is going to arrive hot at the table. </p> <p> <strong> Then why are they introducing freestyle?</strong> <br> The cruise industry has been booming but the lines have responded by building more - and bigger - ships. We docked in Nassau, the Bahamas, alongside the largest ship in the world, the Explorer of the Sea. This Royal Caribbean Cruise Line vessel weighs in at 137,028 tonnes - more than twice the weight of the QE2 - and carries up to 3,800 passengers and a crew of 1,800. Sixteen ships will be launched this year, many carrying at least 2,000 passengers. </p> <p> <strong> That's a lot extra berths to fill.</strong> <br> Precisely. The cruise lines will have to find new passengers. The number of British passengers has increased four-fold in the past decade from 186,000 in 1990 to 859,631 in 1999 and last year's figures, out next week, are likely to show continuing growth. But experts expect this to slow down. Significantly, the average age of passengers has been falling - by roughly a year each year. Your average passenger in 1999 was 54 and the biggest growth in sales has been among the 45 to 54-year-olds. But this new generation of passengers reflects changing lifestyles. We're less stuffy and while we might enjoy dressing up from time to time, we don't like to be regimented. Freestyle cruising is an attempt to reach out to a more informal group of travellers. </p> <p> <strong> Will it catch on?</strong> <br> Princess Cruises has introduced dining on demand on some ships and the other lines will follow.

      "bodyText": "What is meant by 'freestyle'? Many of the formal rules of cruising have been thrown overboard. You can leave your jacket and tie at home if you wish. The evening dress code has been designated as 'resort casual' though, rather like a golf club, you are asked not to wear shorts or jeans in the main public areas in the evening. Dining at pre-assigned tables with strangers at one of two sittings has been abandoned. You can now eat in any of the restaurants between 5.30pm and midnight. Real slobs can wear what they like at night as they graze along the buffet in the informal caf\u00e9 on the pool deck. So it's goodbye to the captain's table? Not exactly. We were invited to join Captain Haakon Gangdal (from Bergen) and his senior officers on the one formal night of our week on board. This followed the amiable captain's welcome party for all 2,000 guests spread over two decks on the three-storey atrium at the centre of the ship. But the formality is optional, with black tie or dark suit required in one restaurant. Do you really have a choice of restaurants? Yes. You can turn up at any time from 5.30pm at the two main restaurants, the Four Seasons, where the captain hosted his table, or the Seven Seas. You can ask for a table for up to 10 friends and will probably be offered the chance to sit with other people. That sounds dreadful. The maitre d' will give you a table for two if you ask. Besides, some passengers enjoy the social side of cruising. A retired couple from Bromley told me: 'We spend much more time together now than when we were working so we like to meet new people on holiday.' What are the options? There are three smaller speciality restaurants which take bookings 36 hours in advance. Le Bistro serves a classic French menu in a candlelit setting on deck 12, while Ciao-Chow serves Asian 'fusion' food and pizzas in a more informal atmosphere. Our favourite was Horizons, which serves a modern Italian menu in a narrow room styled like the carriages of an Orient Express train. If you prefer to snack, you can enjoy excellent Spanish tapas in Gatsby's bar and some spicy Balinesian canap\u00e9s in the Observation Lounge. And the caf\u00e9 serves basic fare for the shorts and T-shirt brigade. There must be a drawback. You pay a $10 a head surcharge for the three speciality restaurants, which mounts up if you prefer these more intimate settings. The menus remain the same all week, presumably to encourage you to eat around. And you may be asked to wait for a table at the 'free' main restaurants. An elderly couple from Cheltenham complained that they had to wait 15 minutes when they turned up at 8pm, the peak hour, at the Four Seasons. Couldn't they have had a drink at the bar? I would have gone back to the champagne bar on deck six. But it does illustrate a point. Traditional cruise passengers are conservative by nature and may prefer the certainties of the more formal style. And there is an administrative problem, too. The two-sitting, banquet-style meals are easier to serve in the large restaurants. The chefs have to adjust to cooking to order and the waiting staff have to work to a different rhythm if the food is going to arrive hot at the table. Then why are they introducing freestyle? The cruise industry has been booming but the lines have responded by building more - and bigger - ships. We docked in Nassau, the Bahamas, alongside the largest ship in the world, the Explorer of the Sea. This Royal Caribbean Cruise Line vessel weighs in at 137,028 tonnes - more than twice the weight of the QE2 - and carries up to 3,800 passengers and a crew of 1,800. Sixteen ships will be launched this year, many carrying at least 2,000 passengers. That's a lot extra berths to fill. Precisely. The cruise lines will have to find new passengers. The number of British passengers has increased four-fold in the past decade from 186,000 in 1990 to 859,631 in 1999 and last year's figures, out next week, are likely to show continuing growth. But experts expect this to slow down. Significantly, the average age of passengers has been falling - by roughly a year each year. Your average passenger in 1999 was 54 and the biggest growth in sales has been among the 45 to 54-year-olds. But this new generation of passengers reflects changing lifestyles. We're less stuffy and while we might enjoy dressing up from time to time, we don't like to be regimented. Freestyle cruising is an attempt to reach out to a more informal group of travellers. Will it catch on? Princess Cruises has introduced dining on demand on some ships and the other lines will follow. The more traditional lines such as P&amp;O and Cunard may move carefully to avoid alienating existing passengers. It's rather like staterooms (as they insist on calling cabins) with private balconies - once you've stayed in one, you won't want to go back to a mere porthole. Having tried freestyle, I hesitate to sail on a ship with two sittings at set times in its restaurants where you have to wear a jacket and tie. What about the cruise itself? I can't deny there is something slightly naff about sailing the Caribbean with 2,000 non-like-minded people in a ship with gawdy decor. But the multinational crew were outstanding, combining upfront warmth with thoughtful service. The beaches in the Bahamas (where NCL has its own island) and the Caymans were terrific and Donovan, our Jamaican guide, was the best I've ever encountered. Best of all, we had two full days with nothing to do but sit on our balcony at the stern and watch the wake slip by. So you would go again? Small problem. I love ships and we enjoyed a lot of private time on board but my wife finds the scale and style a bit over the top. I'll have to organise many weeks of self-catering close to a Cornish beach before I get her to sea again.

But never before has a holiday filled me with pure, abject fear. I drink all the time, eat belt-busting quantities of the finest foods, and my idea of exercise is walking to the gym, losing heart and walking back. When I was appointed health editor of The Observer, friends joked that it was as appropriate as employing Gazza as an opera critic. My favourite health story so far has been a study suggesting beer is as good for your heart as red wine.</p> <p>So the prospect of a week of salads, mineral water and aerobics made me feel distinctly ill even before I'd got on the plane. In my suitcase, I hid an emergency survival kit of two bottles of Chianti, and some Lindt dark chocolate. I joke not.</p> <p>My fears started to subside when my partner Paula and I arrived at Tinarana, a nineteenth-century mansion lording it over the west coast of Ireland. Four years ago it was restored to its full Victorian grandeur of wood-panelled walls, chandeliers, and a roof that doesn't leak. Things got better when we saw our bedroom, with an oak four-poster bed, and broad windows looking out over meadows and the 300-acre estate to Lough Derg, with a backdrop of leprechaun green hills.</p> <p>My spirits rose further still when we went down to the smart dining-room for supper, and had gin and tonics thrust in our hands by the ever-so-nice and over-the-top manager Mary Woodworth. The widow of an Anglican vicar, she is famous throughout the region for having lost, and I mean lost, her car at the bottom of the River Shannon.</p> <p>For dinner I had the hard choice of crispy duck a l'orange or roast rack of Tinarana lamb with mint sauce. For pudding should I have lemon and banana souffle or apple crumble and ice-cream? And - glory of glories - they had a wine list. Of course you can eat just lettuce leaves if you want, but would you have the will-power? The truth is that Tinarana is the sort of health farm where you pile on pounds. In short, it's a health farm only in name. In reality it's a luxury hotel which doubles as a sanitorium. They serve white bread for breakfast, have no gym and no swimming pool. Paula, who was a little keener on the idea of a health farm, was disappointed. People do not come to Tinarana to lose weight or get fit. They come for two other perfectly good reasons.</p> <p>The first is to be un-ashamedly pampered in a beautiful house in a beautiful location, and go for bracing organised walks. You can sweat out your toxins - whatever they are - in the sauna and steam baths. You can have Swedish massage from dawn to dusk, interspersed with age-slashing facials and body-wraps. Or you go to Tinarana because you are ill. It is owned by an alternative - and almost incomprehensible - doctor who has a huge clinic five miles away in the town of Killaloe. People who have lost faith in modern medicine come from across the continent to him for a dose of hope. He charges huge sums for bizarre diagnostic tests that in my view are of no value but which many people swear by.</p> <p>The downside is that many of his patients - often quite sick with cancer - stay in Tinarana, which can make the whole atmosphere a little depressing if you are just there for a good time.</p> <p>The upside is that you can share some of their wilder treatments, such as underwater massage therapy. Submersed in a huge bath with countless taps, Norbert massaged us one by one with a powerful underwater jet. Apparently it takes away the cellulite - I wouldn't know - and pummels your muscles nicely making you feel relaxed.</p> <p>I then opted for fango therapy, having been persuaded that it has nothing to do with vampires. I lay down on a heated tray of mud, and was wrapped in towels. And then I was left to sweat. Apparently all those toxins leach out of me yet again. The heat penetrated right through my back; it's the same nice feeling as a hot bath, but twice as intense. It's meant to be for people with back injuries - but why should they get all the perks? Norbert proudly asked me to guess his age. 'Fifty-five?' I conjectured. 'No, 72!' he triumphed. His secret he insisted was regular colonic irrigation.</p> <p>Now, I have often wondered about the boundaries of journalistic duty. Michael Palin ate snakes for his TV documentary, but I am not sure I could. But then I realised that whatever is good enough for Diana must be good enough for me: huge palaces, countless servants, billionaire lovers, and colonic irrigation.</p> <p>The kind nurse Marion - who said she was lucky to have such an exciting job - ordered me to undress, lie down, and relax while she inserted a huge lubricated dildo-like thing where it really doesn't belong. She turned on the tap, and the water gushed in and then back out again through a transparent pipe. The trick apparently is to carry on until the water is clear.</p> <p>Or until the patient screams they are about to explode. Your whole intestine fills up with water, your stomach distends like a balloon. She increased the pressure, relaxed it, increased it again, in a bid to wash out those dastardly toxins from every little nook and cranny. At the end of it all I felt really quite sick, and slightly in shock. When God made mankind, he definitely didn't do it with colonic irrigation in mind. I did not feel better for it, nor did Paula. But it gave us something to talk about. And gave our psychologically flawed colleagues something to laugh about.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>A two-night stay at <a href=\"http://www.tinaranahouse.com\">Tinarana House</a> costs \u00a3299 per person and includes accommodation, breakfast and dinner, and a full programme of treatments including massage, detox body wrap, facial, aerobics, and a guided walk. Three and five-night breaks are also available. (00 353 61 376 966).</p> <p><strong>The tough option: Weight loss at Claureen on a crash diet of fruit, soup salad and rigorous exercise</strong></p> <p>After piling on the pounds and exuding the toxins at Tinarana, all we needed was a dose of Claureen. Barely half an hour away across the wet west Irish countryside, and you're in another world. Instead of a menu you have a choice of apples or bananas, and a plum if you're lucky. Instead of a wine list, there's a choice of herbal teas. And instead of a Victorian pile with an estate, there's a terrace-style house with a garden near the centre of a town.</p> <p>People serious about losing weight, getting rid of toxins, and starting a new life of virtue come to Claureen for a week or two. And they return, time and again. Legend - and the manager - has it that since it was founded 18 years ago, one person has been 48 times.</p> <p>The regulars like it for precisely the reason it is my idea of hell: only fruit for supper, no drink, and yoga before collapsing into bed. This is a hard-core health farm. The diet is semi-starvation. Breakfast consists of a grapefruit - without sugar - that hardly made me feel I was breaking my fast. Lunch is home-made (and delicious!) soup and salad. You might occasionally get a potato (until you've been here, you have no idea what delight a potato can bring). For dinner, you eat only fruit. There's no coffee, tea, or alcohol.</p> <p>Then there's the hour of aerobics in the morning, the organised walks and the hour and a half of yoga at night.</p> <p>Over the regulation five-day stay, everyone loses weight - you have little choice. One decidedly portly man apparently lost two stone in three weeks. It is of course possible to cheat, but no one admitted to it.</p> <p>Weight isn't the only thing lost. By the third day, there are headaches and lost tempers from caffeine deprivation (a little jar of real coffee is kept to control any emergencies). People get tired and spend a lot of time in their rooms or draped in front of the television. But towards the end of your stay, you feel revitalised and energised. At least that's what I was told.</p> <p>There are many distractions, like Indian head massages, leg waxings and reflexology. As the reflexologist massaged my foot, she told me my big toe was in fact my head, and the little hairy part on top of it was my face - and I could see the likeness. Reflexology is said to heal any ailments, if you have it often enough, keeps your 'body in harmony' and get rid of any toxins that have crept back in. Despite my cynicism, she did find out that my gums are prone to bleeding and that I have an achy knee. Maybe there's something in it. It certainly made my sore feet feel good.</p> <p>There is a definite camaraderie among guests, fighting the common battle against flab and toxins. The hunger got to me, though - after just half a day. I felt miserable. In the evening, as I tried to dissolve my pain in the bliss of sleep, I promised myself a trip to the nearest burger bar in the morning. But a funny thing happened. By the morning I was no longer hungry. I had my grapefruit and waited until lunch. I had a salad lunch and much to my surprise I was fine. My stomach contracted, my body got used to it, and the pounds fell off. If I can lose weight and resist temptation here, anyone can. </p> <p>It worked wonders until it was time to leave and we got to the airport. As I waited for the plane, I had an awful steak and chips. But it's one of the happiest meals I've had for years.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>A five-night package at Claureen costs \u00a3315 per person based on single occupancy or \u00a3285 sharing.

Canada hasn't enjoyed quite the powder falls its smaller, fast-developing resorts were counting on. Some of the great Colorado resorts suffered their 'driest' January for years although more recent snow has evened things out. Despite this, bookings have recovered from the millennium year slump. </p> <p>ANDORRA: Early week light snowfalls gave way to sunny days. Depths in all five resorts are adequate, especially higher up, for enjoyable piste skiing (off-piste is varied) in Arcalis (100cm on lower slopes and 160cm higher up), Pal/Arinsal (70/105cm), Pas de la Casa (100/130cm) and Soldeu (80/140cm), with almost all runs open. </p> <p>AUSTRIA: Busy Ischgl (25/160cm), had good pistes higher up, fair lower ones, and 'packed' off-piste. The big story from this rather pricey resort is that Sting will be this year's end-of-season artist with a concert on the last day of April in the natural amphitheatre at Idalp. The concert is free for all those with lift tickets. Neighbouring Galtur (70/130), scene of the horrific avalanche two years ago, has slightly more snow lower down. St Anton (40/210cm) has been slushy on low runs. Obergurgl (50/160cm) was fine up high and expecting more snow to help resort runs. Kitzbuhel (18/70cm) was similarly placed. Saalbach/Hinterglemm (35/70cm) had some early-week snow. </p> <p>BULGARIA: Snowfalls have improved conditions at Borovets and Pamporovo (both 20/35cm). </p> <p>CANADA: Whistler with a mid-mountain 180cm was using its snowmaking to good effect lower down. It was expecting varied weather with some light falls and occasional winds. Lake Louise (60/80cm) was cold and sunny and expecting light falls. </p> <p>FRANCE: Puy St Vincent (60/220cm) with skiing up to 2,750m is enjoying good conditions. French resorts will still be busy with the last week of the school ski holidays. In the Three Valleys there's been some great, sunny skiing higher up and some slushy home runs. Conditions improve towards Val Thorens (70/170cm). La Rosiere (80/150cm) had excellent pistes and was drawing the Italian weekenders from La Thuile. Les Deux Alpes (40/200cm) was colder and better at the top. </p> <p>ITALY: Madesimo (150/530cm) and Livigno (140/315cm) had the world's deepest snowbases. Earlier in the week conditions at Courmayeur (90/300cm) and La Thuile (140/250cm) were terrific, especially higher up. Aprica (20/370cm), Cervinia (100/300cm), Passo Tonale (50/220cm) and Selva (20/200cm) were typical. Both Sella Ronda and Milky Way, Sestriere were still a very skiable 80/140cm. </p> <p>NORWAY: Hemsedal (140/210cm) and Geilo (130/145cm) are still good; Voss (40/60cm) is still struggling. In Sweden, Are (40/65cm) was needing more low down. </p> <p>SPAIN: Sierra Nevada (100/280cm) still holding well. In Formigal (45/235cm) rain threatened lower runs. </p> <p>SWITZERLAND: St Moritz (150/320cm) is having a superb season. Saas Fee (85/300cm) has had great skiing higher up. Davos (60/150cm), Verbier (35/90cm) and Grindlewald (25/105cm) hoped for more snow. Zermatt (60/215cm) was better placed after some snowfalls. South-facing Crans Montana (160/220cm) had been sunny everywhere and slushy low down. </p> <p>USA: Snowbird in Utah (190/240cm) was lying fourth in the world deepest snow list. In the East, Vermont's Smuggler's Notch (70/130cm), a family-first resort just over a pass from Stowe (95/140cm), had expected early week falls to continue. Killington (75/175cm) too was excellent. It was gusty but there had been some fresh snow at Winter Park (mid-mountain 150cm). Other Colorado resorts were doing equally well. It was packed powder with a little fresh snow almost everywhere: Aspen (92cm), Breckenridge (104cm), Steamboat (127cm), Telluride (137cm) Vail (106cm) and its ritzy neighbour Beaver Creek (124cm). In California, Mammoth (210/240cm) and Heavenly (80/130cm), both popular with British skiers, were doing well. </p> <p>ON THE SLOPES: King Abdullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan have been skiing in Lech. Earlier this year Michael Schumacher ('a duck on roller skates') tempted fate by skiing in Madonna di Campiglio. </p> <p>BEST SKIING: Puy St Vincent, where Snowbizz (01778 341 455, <a href=\"http://www.snowbizz.co.uk)\">www.snowbizz.co.uk)</a> offers seven nights self-catering, departing next Sunday, for \u00a3374, based on two sharing a studio, including flights and transfers. </p> <p> The AITO directory of ski operators, whose reps help with this report, is available free by calling 020 8607 9080.</p>",

Aprica (20/370cm), Cervinia (100/300cm), Passo Tonale (50/220cm) and Selva (20/200cm) were typical. Both Sella Ronda and Milky Way, Sestriere were still a very skiable 80/140cm. NORWAY: Hemsedal (140/210cm) and Geilo (130/145cm) are still good; Voss (40/60cm) is still struggling. In Sweden, Are (40/65cm) was needing more low down. SPAIN: Sierra Nevada (100/280cm) still holding well. In Formigal (45/235cm) rain threatened lower runs. SWITZERLAND: St Moritz (150/320cm) is having a superb season. Saas Fee (85/300cm) has had great skiing higher up. Davos (60/150cm), Verbier (35/90cm) and Grindlewald (25/105cm) hoped for more snow. Zermatt (60/215cm) was better placed after some snowfalls. South-facing Crans Montana (160/220cm) had been sunny everywhere and slushy low down. USA: Snowbird in Utah (190/240cm) was lying fourth in the world deepest snow list. In the East, Vermont's Smuggler's Notch (70/130cm), a family-first resort just over a pass from Stowe (95/140cm), had expected early week falls to continue. Killington (75/175cm) too was excellent. It was gusty but there had been some fresh snow at Winter Park (mid-mountain 150cm). Other Colorado resorts were doing equally well. It was packed powder with a little fresh snow almost everywhere: Aspen (92cm), Breckenridge (104cm), Steamboat (127cm), Telluride (137cm) Vail (106cm) and its ritzy neighbour Beaver Creek (124cm). In California, Mammoth (210/240cm) and Heavenly (80/130cm), both popular with British skiers, were doing well. ON THE SLOPES: King Abdullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan have been skiing in Lech. Earlier this year Michael Schumacher ('a duck on roller skates') tempted fate by skiing in Madonna di Campiglio. BEST SKIING: Puy St Vincent, where Snowbizz (01778 341 455, www.snowbizz.co.uk) offers seven nights self-catering, departing next Sunday, for \u00a3374, based on two sharing a studio, including flights and transfers.

The poodle could try to make it on his own in the woods, but accustomed to domestication, the sorry cur realises his only hope for a bowl of Kibbles is to lick the slippers of the new masters of the House. </p> <p>This week, the PM meets with the new resident of the White House, and will do his best to show he can fetch and carry. Certainly, his riding in the back of Bush's bomber to Baghdad earned him a biscuit. Unfortunately for Blair, George Bush can see right through Clinton's former pet PM. And he doesn't like what he sees. </p> <p>Bush may be thick as a T-bone on a barbecue, but those he pays to think for him have told the president that Blair unsubtly supported the candidacy of Al Gore and worse, actually believes in the Clinton-Gore Third Way, which Bushites snub as a muddy trench to nowhere. </p> <p>What can Tony do to win a warm place on the rug near Bush's feet? To the rescue has come an obedience trainer to explain all the PM must do: Dr Irwin Stelzer. For those of you foolish enough to believe that Stelzer, bespectacled professor and Sunday Times columnist, is just some freelance scribbler, let me set you straight. Dr Stelzer is the most powerful lobbyist in Britain bar none. He is Rupert Murdoch's policy adviser, but no lowly retainer on the payroll. A multi-millionaire without Murdoch's help, Stelzer has become a sculptor of the thoughts and conduit of the wishes of the planet's most powerful men. </p> <p>'Lobbyist' describes only one of Stelzer's functions and certainly does not do justice to his authority. To my knowledge, Stelzer is the only policy adviser who can walk into the Prime Minister's office at will. But now he won't bother. </p> <p>Stelzer has determined to deliver a nasty little dressing-down to the PM in public and nail George Bush's wish list to Blair's forehead with a rusty tack. </p> <p>Rather than speak to his friend Tony directly, Stelzer chose the forum of the Times to deliver the word from Bush's team. In his column on 4 January Stelzer wrote, 'Tony Blair has lost two big bets and the British people will have to pay up.' </p> <p>Here are particulars on the invoice, which Stelzer makes clear were communicated to him by the new Washington powers. First, 'America will need to upgrade radar equipment at RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire' for the new Star Wars missile system. (Note the phrasing, 'America will need...' Forget the buddy-buddy 'we' need.) </p> <p>But missiles aren't money. The bill will be paid by Bush's plans for control of the UK economy. </p> <p>First, says Stelzer, out of the window must go EU health restrictions on the importation of American beef. (I can't help but note that the US was the first nation to ban British beef, years before Europe acted, and continues to do so.) </p> <p>Bush, rhinestone cowboy though he is, has more on his mind than cattle. The president's team, says Stelzer, are 'unhappy' with Europe's resistance to signing up to the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats). As Blair's goal from this day forward must be Bush's happiness, let me provide a helpful guide to the Gats. Corporate America's wish list, and therefore that of the president, includes adding a 'necessity' test to Article Six of Gats. If Bush prevails, what that means is that Europe may not impose laws and regulations on businesses unless they are 'least trade-restrictive'. </p> <p>Britain may have to put itself in a position similar to that of Mexico under the Nafta treaty. For example, the Nafta board ordered Mexico to pay millions of dollars to an American company for delaying the building of the firm's toxic waste processing plant, although Mexico concluded the plant could pollute ground water. </p> <p>The Bushies also want to extend the WTO's 'National Treatment' provisions to ensure that all public services are opened to bidding by US privateers. Want to keep the NHS public? Well, forget it, Jack! (I should note that Peter Mandelson, always a step ahead, is already Stelzerised and Gats-ready. During Mandy's year between portfolios in 1999, he travelled to all the power points on the planet, from Aspen to Bilderberg and, notably, to the Hudson Institute in Washington DC. At ultra-right Hudson, founded by the living model for Dr Strangelove, Herman Kahn, Stelzer trains world leaders in the details of deregulating, decapitating and selling off public services.) </p> <p>And Mr Blair need no longer worry about all those little holes in the ozone. Stelzer reports that Paul O'Neill, Bush's new Treasury Secretary, 'is very sceptical about the global warming scare'. Therefore, says Stelzer, Blair's job is to lay down the law to Europe and tell them to get off their 'anti-market, anti-permit-trading position'. </p> <p>The White House demands that Europe back off its opposition to any restrictions on the trade in these credits for filth. The US wants to buy pollution rights from Russia and thereby relieve American industry from any need to cut ozone-depleting carbon dioxide emissions under the Kyoto Treaty. </p> <p>Remember when John Prescott got caught up last year in a bitch-fight with France's environment minister? It was all about these crud credits. But now, it's away with Prescott's clownish attempts to bridge the gap between America's demands and Europe's. Rather, warns Stelzer, 'Britain is going to have to choose'. And Britain had better choose the American Way because, as Stelzer says: 'America has a new captain with an aversion to Third Way bilge.' </p> <p>Stelzer's former comrade at the American Enterprise Institute, Larry Lindsey, now heads Bush's council of economic advisers. </p> <p>Stelzer reports that Lindsey laid down the law to one of Gordon Brown's minions that the Bush team would slice Britain right out of the trade talks power loop unless Blair agreed to join in the American push to smash EU trade controls, including the restrictions on US films and television. </p> <p>Last month, Stelzer took the message against regulation of media to the Commons Culture Committee where, on behalf of News Corp, he warned the Government against maintaining restrictions on cross-media ownership. </p> <p>The communications White Paper wove and waffled on the issue.

Besides, Blair is already adapting to the new order. The Financial Times reports, deadpan, that the Government 'has accepted the view that media markets have changed significantly since [the communications] legislation was devised' and that, 'there was an argument for no regulation [of ownership] because of the proliferation of new services'.

No Walkman presentation could compete with this history buff's racy ad libs. </p> <p>'Mister Castle', as he is known to the locals, is a qualified archaeologist and delights in sharing his enthusiasm for the past. He is also a shrewd observer of contemporary national traits. 'Americans will ask the most basic questions,' he says. 'The Brits, who feel that castles are so much a part of their landscape they cannot admit ignorance, keep mum.' </p> <p>King Edward built his castle to impress the unruly natives, but more than half of Edward's conquering army was made up of Welsh speakers. Himself the Welsh-speaking son of a Polish Battle of Britain veteran, our guide is well-placed to take a more detached view of ancient family quarrels, and admits that his task is facilitated by the substantial presence of what he calls the 'best visual aid in the world'. Caernarfon's sea-girt castle, with its striped curtain wall like a layered gateau and its polygonal towers, is said to have been inspired by royal memories of the splendours of Byzantium brought back from the Crusades. </p> <p>Today the castle, sprawled along the southern shore of the Menai Strait, is like a stranded whale on a beach. 'The whale belongs in the sea and this castle belongs 700 years ago,' our guide says. 'The twenty-first century is not its natural environment.' </p> <p>He pauses for his words to sink in before striding off purposefully to the next location and a demonstration of the practicality of a thirteenth century waste-disposal unit. </p> <p>From vertical grooves in the walls and apertures above our heads, Mister Castle is able to demonstrate that the King's Gate was protected by no fewer than five doors and six portcullises, while a pattern of protruding stones recalls an intention to expand which was never fulfilled. De Lewandowicz is eager to dispel myths and what he calls the Robin Hood heresy. 'Most people's preconceptions of a castle are based on Hollywood epics,' he explains. Castles were not the cheerless, draughty hovels of filmic fiction. </p> <p>Similar to Norman churches, the castle windows were glazed and fitted with shutters against the elements, while inner walls were plastered and painted, with every room enjoying en-suite toilet facilities. In short, conditions for the garrison, which amazingly never exceeded 28, were quite comfortable. </p> <p>Caernarfon Castle was the ultimate example of military overspending. 'Edward was bankrupt in 14 years.' The chain of Gwynedd castles built to subdue the Welsh might be compared with America's on-off Star Wars initiative. 'They, too, were rendered obsolete by political changes.' </p> <p>Caernarfon castle is the work of James of St George, a master mason borrowed from a Savoyard uncle with whom Edward stayed on his return from the Crusades. Contemporary records show that Master James was paid two shillings a day, as much as your average craftsman could hope to earn in a week. </p> <p>Nine towers and two gatehouses punctuate his stout curtain wall, with hinged ramparts giving the appearance of a pop-up castle in a child's history book. The impressive Eagle Tower is unique, its triple turrets each topped by a stone eagle denoting imperial power, although the castle scarcely ever fulfilled its regal pretensions. 'The first king to sleep here was Richard II for three nights in 1399,' our guide points out. 'The last was Richard II for three nights in 1399.' </p> <p>It was David Lloyd George, the town's wily MP for 55 years, who concocted the Investiture ceremony for the future Edward VIII, the event launching a new era of royal involvement with the castle. Tourists are shown the spot where the present monarch invested her son as Prince of Wales. He, admittedly, was not born hereabouts, but learnt sufficient Welsh then to make a speech - a feat that would defeat three-quarters of his Principality's inhabitants. </p> <p>The televised 1969 ceremony, seen by millions worldwide, encouraged half a million visitors to the town at that time, although 200,000 is now a more realistic expectation. </p> <p>The local authority is involved in a number of schemes to regenerate the castle environs and reverse the decline. Long before the arrival of the Normans, their town was one of the farthest-flung outposts of the Roman Empire. Indeed, stones from the fort at nearby Segontium were plundered for the castle. The Roman ruins are open to the public. </p> <p>Upkeep of castles such as Caernarfon is paid for out of the taxes of ordinary folk, says De Lewandowicz, who keeps the tours easily comprehensible. A common reaction, which brings him great pleasure, is an appreciative: 'You made it all come alive.' </p> <p>\u0095 Caernarfon Castle: open daily 9.30am-4pm.

'They, too, were rendered obsolete by political changes.' Caernarfon castle is the work of James of St George, a master mason borrowed from a Savoyard uncle with whom Edward stayed on his return from the Crusades. Contemporary records show that Master James was paid two shillings a day, as much as your average craftsman could hope to earn in a week. Nine towers and two gatehouses punctuate his stout curtain wall, with hinged ramparts giving the appearance of a pop-up castle in a child's history book. The impressive Eagle Tower is unique, its triple turrets each topped by a stone eagle denoting imperial power, although the castle scarcely ever fulfilled its regal pretensions. 'The first king to sleep here was Richard II for three nights in 1399,' our guide points out. 'The last was Richard II for three nights in 1399.' It was David Lloyd George, the town's wily MP for 55 years, who concocted the Investiture ceremony for the future Edward VIII, the event launching a new era of royal involvement with the castle. Tourists are shown the spot where the present monarch invested her son as Prince of Wales. He, admittedly, was not born hereabouts, but learnt sufficient Welsh then to make a speech - a feat that would defeat three-quarters of his Principality's inhabitants. The televised 1969 ceremony, seen by millions worldwide, encouraged half a million visitors to the town at that time, although 200,000 is now a more realistic expectation. The local authority is involved in a number of schemes to regenerate the castle environs and reverse the decline. Long before the arrival of the Normans, their town was one of the farthest-flung outposts of the Roman Empire. Indeed, stones from the fort at nearby Segontium were plundered for the castle. The Roman ruins are open to the public. Upkeep of castles such as Caernarfon is paid for out of the taxes of ordinary folk, says De Lewandowicz, who keeps the tours easily comprehensible. A common reaction, which brings him great pleasure, is an appreciative: 'You made it all come alive.' \u0095 Caernarfon Castle: open daily 9.30am-4pm. Adults \u00a34.20, children and concessions \u00a33.20. Tel 01286 677617. Historic Tours: Adults \u00a31.50. Parties of up to 30, \u00a325, have to be booked in advance. Tel 01286 674369.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair and George Bush appeared to have struck an historic deal at the weekend which could chart the European and US military map for years to come. They agreed a swap of British compliance over National Missile Defence - the so-called Son of Star Wars - in return for unexpectedly robust support from the White House for a European defence force. But claims by Downing Street officials of a triumph for the Prime Minister were tempered by reports of a frostier meeting between Mr Blair and Vice President Dick Cheney, and declared opposition to the EU defence force plan from within Mr Bush's administration. The President pledged his 'support' for Britain's view of the defence force as one which would only intervene when 'Nato as a whole chooses not to be engaged'. Blair in turn said he would 'welcome a dialogue' on the proposed NMD, putting no obstacle in Bush's path. At an evening briefing, however, Bush's spokesman Ari Fleischer put some tougher language behind the harmony of the afternoon's conference and document. He made it clear that although Bush had cast himself in a consultative role on NMD - which would provide a shield designed to protect the US against missiles fired by 'rogue' states such as North Korea - so far as the administration is concerned, there will be no compromise. Bush's policy in Europe will be to start the 'discussion process' with a supportive Britain and work outwards - dictating terms more than canvassing opinions. The President, said Fleischer, 'wanted to begin with America's closest allies, as he has done with Blair'.On the other hand, in conversations on a European defence force, President Bush had clearly listened to a tutorial from Mr Blair - using Britain's view of how it should work as a transatlantic intermediary. The Prime Minister had, said Alastair Campbell, his spokesman, 'set out a forward-looking vision of what he believes the EU is doing' and how Britain is in shaping the future of European defence. Bush had accordingly replied: 'That sounds pretty fine by me.' The President's embrace of the EU defence force comes as a success and surprise for Blair, since it runs counter to the position of the newly forged 'iron triangle' within Bush's administration, comprising Cheney, Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz. After the recent Munich security summit, Rumsfeld said he was 'concerned' about the European force. Now The Observer has been told that a meeting between Blair and Cheney on Friday, 'lacked the openly friendly atmosphere' of his talk and walk-in-the-woods with the President. Blair is said by an official at the State Department to have presented his vision of how a European defence force would work; Cheney 'listened but showed no great enthusiasm'. The Observer further learned from sources in the Pentagon that the Prime Minister did win of guarantee that US troops would remain in the Balkans for as long as Nato's presence there was deemed necessary by the alliance. British sources have also told The Observer that Blair had petitioned the President to put the Real IRA on the list of proscribed organisations in the US, banning it from legal fund-raising.",

Hoping to spark a debate about NHS funding, William Hague's top health adviser last night indicated the party believed in large-scale privatisation of the health service as well as means-testing for patients. In an interview with The Observer , which immediately provoked accusations that the Tories had a secret plan to 'privatise the NHS', Dr Michael Goldsmith said that it was time for radical thinking about how the country treats millions of patients every year. Goldsmith said there should be a complete overhaul of health provision, described modernisation of the NHS as following the 'railway' model and said that it could eventually be left as a provider of 'core services' rather than offering universal care as at present. Goldsmith, who said his views were 'personal', said that without the change the NHS would not give the public the service they deserved. A number of senior Tories are said privately to agree with him, although one admitted that it would be 'political dynamite' to admit it publicly.

The contrasts could hardly have been stronger. In Essex we drove through Constable country, with cosy pubs and steepled villages where in pious times 'tireless striving stretched its arms towards perfection'.</p> <p>In one village, the aptly named Steeple Bumpstead, we were directed towards the leader of the local community, Stanley Drapkin, who had been a colonial officer in the old days and retained the air of a benign mikado. His concerns were overwhelmingly local - his preoccupation at the time was the positioning of the 30mph sign inside the village perimeter. He passionately denounced the local council.</p> <p>Derby was grittier, but still overwhelmingly parochial. A campaign was being mounted to raise a statue to Bonnie Prince Charlie, whose rebellion, of course, came to an end north of the city.</p> <p>It was only in Newcastle that one picked up a real sense of regional identity, enough to give life to Labour's policy of balancing devolution in Scotland, Wales and Ireland with regional bodies in England.</p> <p>Indeed, when he gets to Northumberland on the road from London, a Scot feels he is very nearly home. The stone-built houses, the heather on the hill, the crown steeple rising over Newcastle, the people with a highly developed sense of themselves - these are the constituents of a vin d'origine particulier . They say the Scot is a Geordie with his brains bashed out, or vice versa depending on the point of view.</p> <p>Gordon Brown continues to put much faith in regional devolution in England as a means of placating the English backlash to Scottish's semi-autonomy. But at the moment the main regional impetus is economic rather than political, with the evolution of development agencies.</p> <p>Of course the Scottish Development Agency was introduced by Labour in the Seventies partly in response to the rise of nationalism. Brown is trying to do things in reverse and one wonders if he can possibly succeed unless there is a rise in regional sentiment at the popular political level.</p> <p>Two preconditions for devolution found in Scotland are certainly emerging in English regions. First, there is a growing sense of grievance - in this case about Scotland's allegedly favourable financial treatment, negatively in the ravings of right-wing columnists, more positively in the minds of regional strategists who see it being turned to advantage.</p> <p>Secondly, an academic industry is emerging to support the case for regional devolution - this was a notable feature of the Scottish scene long before the matter became established on the political agenda. Last week the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies at Newcastle University issued its second report in a series 'monitoring the English regions'.</p> <p>Its conclusion was that the regional issue has moved sharply up the political agenda. It cited Brown's recent intervention - which may produce a firm commitment in Labour's manifesto; the White Paper on Enterprise this month which gave prominent place to regional development agencies; and a tendency for some Conservatives, even in the South, to 'develop a taste for regionalism'. The official policy of the party is still to axe the regional agencies to help pay for tax cuts. Only the Liberal Democrats, with their historic commitment to federalism, remain complete enthusiasts.</p> <p>But the third pre-condition seems completely lacking - the political fire that the SNP brought to Scottish politics from the end of the Sixties. As Mae West famously said, it's not the men in my life, 'it's the life in my men' that counts; and as one travels about England the issue seems very rarely on the agenda. People simply do not talk about it in pubs or over dinner tables. But if England eventually gets its regional assemblies, what will Scotland want then?</p>",

Derby was grittier, but still overwhelmingly parochial. A campaign was being mounted to raise a statue to Bonnie Prince Charlie, whose rebellion, of course, came to an end north of the city. It was only in Newcastle that one picked up a real sense of regional identity, enough to give life to Labour's policy of balancing devolution in Scotland, Wales and Ireland with regional bodies in England. Indeed, when he gets to Northumberland on the road from London, a Scot feels he is very nearly home. The stone-built houses, the heather on the hill, the crown steeple rising over Newcastle, the people with a highly developed sense of themselves - these are the constituents of a vin d'origine particulier . They say the Scot is a Geordie with his brains bashed out, or vice versa depending on the point of view. Gordon Brown continues to put much faith in regional devolution in England as a means of placating the English backlash to Scottish's semi-autonomy. But at the moment the main regional impetus is economic rather than political, with the evolution of development agencies. Of course the Scottish Development Agency was introduced by Labour in the Seventies partly in response to the rise of nationalism. Brown is trying to do things in reverse and one wonders if he can possibly succeed unless there is a rise in regional sentiment at the popular political level. Two preconditions for devolution found in Scotland are certainly emerging in English regions. First, there is a growing sense of grievance - in this case about Scotland's allegedly favourable financial treatment, negatively in the ravings of right-wing columnists, more positively in the minds of regional strategists who see it being turned to advantage. Secondly, an academic industry is emerging to support the case for regional devolution - this was a notable feature of the Scottish scene long before the matter became established on the political agenda. Last week the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies at Newcastle University issued its second report in a series 'monitoring the English regions'. Its conclusion was that the regional issue has moved sharply up the political agenda. It cited Brown's recent intervention - which may produce a firm commitment in Labour's manifesto; the White Paper on Enterprise this month which gave prominent place to regional development agencies; and a tendency for some Conservatives, even in the South, to 'develop a taste for regionalism'. The official policy of the party is still to axe the regional agencies to help pay for tax cuts. Only the Liberal Democrats, with their historic commitment to federalism, remain complete enthusiasts. But the third pre-condition seems completely lacking - the political fire that the SNP brought to Scottish politics from the end of the Sixties. As Mae West famously said, it's not the men in my life, 'it's the life in my men' that counts; and as one travels about England the issue seems very rarely on the agenda. People simply do not talk about it in pubs or over dinner tables. But if England eventually gets its regional assemblies, what will Scotland want then?",

      "body": "<p>The passengers looked down grimly from the deck as their luxury cruise ship, the Galapagos Explorer II, sailed out from the harbour past the eerie wreck of the oil tanker Jessica, lying on its side, semi-submerged in the azure Galapagos waters. </p> <p>The Jessica had been on its way to refuel the very same Explorer II when it struck rocks last month and regurgitated its filthy load into this priceless marine paradise. This was the first trip by the Explorer II since the accident. </p> <p>For tourists visiting the area there is no sign of oily waters, black beaches or dead wildlife. Conservationists estimate just one pelican perished, while several sea lions and 100 birds had to be rescued from the oil and cleaned up. Millions of invertebrates at the bottom of the fragile food chain were destroyed and the marine iguanas' food source of algae was contaminated. </p> <p>The near catastrophe has raised questions about ecotourism in this supposedly pristine marine reserve. The debate is particularly pertinent for Ecuador which contains part of the stunning Andes mountain chain and is blessed with ownership of the Galapagos Islands as well as a large chunk of virgin rainforest at the top of the Amazon basin. </p> <p>The passengers on board the Explorer II earlier this month spoke of their relief at arriving to find clean seas. Quiet relief turned to excitement as they caught the first glimpse of the islands' unique creatures. </p> <p>Blue-footed boobies flew within feet of the dinghies, while pelicans skimmed heads as they dived like combat aircraft into shallow water in search of fish. People tripped over sleeping sea lions on the curved white beach and had close encounters with others staring into their masks while out snorkelling. Lurid green and red marine iguanas basked on rocks like prehistoric statues while visitors snapped away on their cameras. </p> <p>The Galapagos's animals are famously fearless of humans. Only the bright orange ghost crabs ran away: they are one of the few creatures in this isolated archipelago that have natural enemies. </p> <p>On Genovesa, just to the north of the Equator , groups from the Explorer II climbed the steep laval outcrops to find hundreds of masked boobies whistling their haunting mating calls to the sky, and frigate birds puffing out their red chest pouches. </p> <p>The unique giant tortoises that helped inspire Charles Darwin's breakthrough work on evolution in 1859, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , were to be seen in the captive breeding programmes at the Charles Darwin station on Santa Cruz island or, in a more natural setting, up in the hills nearby, where they creep freely through the trees. A short woodland trail ends suddenly in a vast lagoon, where the tortoises paddle in slow motion surrounded by huge ferns in a scene straight out of Jurassic Park . </p> <p>Unfortunately, on this particular expedition, the tour bus bumped into one of the giant creatures blocking the track. The guide jumped down from the bus and heaved the tortoise by its shell on to the verge. And this is where the foundations of ecotourism start to look a bit shaky. Despite warnings from nature guides not to disturb anything at all, one passenger snapped her fingers at preening birds to get a good camera shot; another pocketed a crab shell; one hugged a tortoise; and there was frequent spillage of suncream, which harms the coral and seals. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the ship itself makes much of its use of biodegradable soaps, while its engine uses a vile mix of diesel and so-called bunker - a heavier, low-grade fuel - and its 105-passenger capacity makes it the largest of the 82 cruise ships allowed here. With sealed window cabins and 24-hour air conditioning, it con stantly pumps black smoke from its funnels and admits to dumping the contents of its toilets out at sea in the dead of night. </p> <p>The Explorer II's expedition leader and naturalist guide Billy Chiquito said: 'In the beginning, tour boats had saltwater showers and no air conditioning, but tourists demand more luxury. It would cost a lot to convert our engine but we are looking at putting electric engines on the dinghies.' </p> <p><strong> Annual tourist limits in the Galapagos have </strong> soared in the last five years from 45,000 to 70,000, and the mostly fifty-something visitors fly in on 30-year-old jets. Chiquito said that only 8 per cent of the 4,500 square mile land mass of the islands is accessible to tourists on controlled itineraries, while only 3 per cent of the land is inhabited. </p> <p>Tourists' main contribution to the region is the $100 compulsory visitor tax paid by each one. Chiquito complained that most of the money was siphoned off by the Ecuadorian government. But Jennifer Stone, of the London-based Galapagos Conservation Trust, which is linked to the Charles Darwin Foundation, said she was confident, since the rules were tightened up in 1998, that 95 per cent of the tax reaches the islands. </p> <p>Stone and other conservationists believe the Galapagos environment is less under threat from tourism than from the fishing industry, the invasion of 'alien' species, such as goats, horses and rats, and the permanent community of 16,000 Galapagos residents. </p> <p>One local guide said: 'There are little oil spills and diesel dumping from cruise boats and fishing boats around here all the time - but they never tell you about that.' </p> <p>Oil may be a dirty word in the Galapagos but it is regarded as black gold on the mainland, where it is the chief earner of export revenues since Texaco struck rich reserves in the north-east of Ecuador in the Seventies. Vast areas of jungle and the culture of many indigenous communities have been destroyed in the pursuit of wealth - a familiar story across the Amazon. Now several oil companies from North America and Europe are closing in on the glorious rainforest in the south-east of Ecuador, where nature and the blow-gun hunting lifestyle of the Shuar and Achuar indigenous people have remained relatively untouched. </p> <p>In the heart of this region on the Peruvian border and at least 20 days' walk from the nearest town is the Kapawi Eco Lodge, a tourism venture created in a pact between the Achuar community and the same Ecuadorian business venture, Canodros, that owns the Explorer II cruise ship. Up to 40 tourists a time are flown in on tiny planes, landing on mud air strips. The Kapawi lodge runs on solar energy, log cabins (built with wooden nails) and rules of one five-minute shower for each person a day under dim lighting. </p> <p>The lack of concrete, Tarmac and mechanical noise is a tonic, the air instead being filled with the sounds of whooping birds, cicadas and howler monkeys, and the scent of steamy undergrowth. Visitors can go kayaking, camping, bird and alligator-watching and, most controversially, visiting Achuar villages, which elicited mixed reactions, with some groups loving it, others squirming at the intrusion. The main activity, though, is forest treks, with an English-speaking Ecuadorian and an Achuar guide. But hasn't the replacement of nudity with jeans and T-shirts and the arrival of aeroplanes, Christianity, school and dollar-wielding tourists blighted the character and culture of the rainforest? </p> <p>Achuar workers at Kapawi argue that leaving everything in the rainforest untouched is not an option. Some want to travel to the capital Quito or abroad to work and study. Others want to stay in the forest living traditionally in huts but with access to schools and air evacuation for medical treatment. </p> <p>That means dollars, which means saying yes to oil, logging or tourists. It took a year of intense negotiations before the Finae, the representative body of the 80,000-strong Achuar community, agreed to admit Kapawi in 1994, on the basis that lower-impact, lucrative tourism is the lesser of the evils. </p> <p>Kapawi pays the Achuar $2,000 a month and has a deal to hand over ownership of the lodge to them entirely in 2011. </p> <p>But all the time, the oil companies, with the Ecuadorian government's blessing, visit the Finae and offer them untold billions to let them tear up the forest. Senior Achuar guide and community leader Irar Washike, said the pressure from the oil industry was immense. </p> <p>'But we have heard what has happened in the north and we will not let them build roads and bring contamination here,' he said. He believes that projects such as Kapawi are conservationist and he is desperate for the Finae to resist selling out to Big Oil. 'Most Achuar feel the same about this. Even if it was my own brother who got bribed, I would kill him to stop the oil companies getting in here.' </p> <p>Many believe the concept of ecotourism is at best a complex solution in a consumers' world, at worst an oxymoron. The dilemma is keenly felt in a country as vivid but fragile as tiny Ecuador. Back on board the Explorer II, one of the local naturalists remarked ruefully that the Jessica accident was an early warning of what could happen if Ecuador was careless with its priceless inheritance. </p> <p>'But we haven't done so badly, despite being a poor country,' he remarked. 'If America or Europe owned the Galapagos islands or our rainforest I believe they would be covered in Holiday Inns and freeways by now.'</p> <p><strong>Factfile</strong></p> <p>Joanna Walters was a guest of UK tour operator <a href=\"http://www.exsus.com\">Exsus Travel</a>, specialist in South America, Mexico, Caribbean (020 7292 5050), in conjunction with Ecuador-based<a href=\"http://www.canodros.com\">Asiri and Canodros</a>.

Blue-footed boobies flew within feet of the dinghies, while pelicans skimmed heads as they dived like combat aircraft into shallow water in search of fish. People tripped over sleeping sea lions on the curved white beach and had close encounters with others staring into their masks while out snorkelling. Lurid green and red marine iguanas basked on rocks like prehistoric statues while visitors snapped away on their cameras. The Galapagos's animals are famously fearless of humans. Only the bright orange ghost crabs ran away: they are one of the few creatures in this isolated archipelago that have natural enemies. On Genovesa, just to the north of the Equator , groups from the Explorer II climbed the steep laval outcrops to find hundreds of masked boobies whistling their haunting mating calls to the sky, and frigate birds puffing out their red chest pouches. The unique giant tortoises that helped inspire Charles Darwin's breakthrough work on evolution in 1859, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , were to be seen in the captive breeding programmes at the Charles Darwin station on Santa Cruz island or, in a more natural setting, up in the hills nearby, where they creep freely through the trees. A short woodland trail ends suddenly in a vast lagoon, where the tortoises paddle in slow motion surrounded by huge ferns in a scene straight out of Jurassic Park . Unfortunately, on this particular expedition, the tour bus bumped into one of the giant creatures blocking the track. The guide jumped down from the bus and heaved the tortoise by its shell on to the verge. And this is where the foundations of ecotourism start to look a bit shaky. Despite warnings from nature guides not to disturb anything at all, one passenger snapped her fingers at preening birds to get a good camera shot; another pocketed a crab shell; one hugged a tortoise; and there was frequent spillage of suncream, which harms the coral and seals. Meanwhile, the ship itself makes much of its use of biodegradable soaps, while its engine uses a vile mix of diesel and so-called bunker - a heavier, low-grade fuel - and its 105-passenger capacity makes it the largest of the 82 cruise ships allowed here. With sealed window cabins and 24-hour air conditioning, it con stantly pumps black smoke from its funnels and admits to dumping the contents of its toilets out at sea in the dead of night. The Explorer II's expedition leader and naturalist guide Billy Chiquito said: 'In the beginning, tour boats had saltwater showers and no air conditioning, but tourists demand more luxury. It would cost a lot to convert our engine but we are looking at putting electric engines on the dinghies.' Annual tourist limits in the Galapagos have soared in the last five years from 45,000 to 70,000, and the mostly fifty-something visitors fly in on 30-year-old jets. Chiquito said that only 8 per cent of the 4,500 square mile land mass of the islands is accessible to tourists on controlled itineraries, while only 3 per cent of the land is inhabited. Tourists' main contribution to the region is the $100 compulsory visitor tax paid by each one. Chiquito complained that most of the money was siphoned off by the Ecuadorian government. But Jennifer Stone, of the London-based Galapagos Conservation Trust, which is linked to the Charles Darwin Foundation, said she was confident, since the rules were tightened up in 1998, that 95 per cent of the tax reaches the islands. Stone and other conservationists believe the Galapagos environment is less under threat from tourism than from the fishing industry, the invasion of 'alien' species, such as goats, horses and rats, and the permanent community of 16,000 Galapagos residents. One local guide said: 'There are little oil spills and diesel dumping from cruise boats and fishing boats around here all the time - but they never tell you about that.' Oil may be a dirty word in the Galapagos but it is regarded as black gold on the mainland, where it is the chief earner of export revenues since Texaco struck rich reserves in the north-east of Ecuador in the Seventies. Vast areas of jungle and the culture of many indigenous communities have been destroyed in the pursuit of wealth - a familiar story across the Amazon. Now several oil companies from North America and Europe are closing in on the glorious rainforest in the south-east of Ecuador, where nature and the blow-gun hunting lifestyle of the Shuar and Achuar indigenous people have remained relatively untouched. In the heart of this region on the Peruvian border and at least 20 days' walk from the nearest town is the Kapawi Eco Lodge, a tourism venture created in a pact between the Achuar community and the same Ecuadorian business venture, Canodros, that owns the Explorer II cruise ship. Up to 40 tourists a time are flown in on tiny planes, landing on mud air strips. The Kapawi lodge runs on solar energy, log cabins (built with wooden nails) and rules of one five-minute shower for each person a day under dim lighting. The lack of concrete, Tarmac and mechanical noise is a tonic, the air instead being filled with the sounds of whooping birds, cicadas and howler monkeys, and the scent of steamy undergrowth. Visitors can go kayaking, camping, bird and alligator-watching and, most controversially, visiting Achuar villages, which elicited mixed reactions, with some groups loving it, others squirming at the intrusion. The main activity, though, is forest treks, with an English-speaking Ecuadorian and an Achuar guide. But hasn't the replacement of nudity with jeans and T-shirts and the arrival of aeroplanes, Christianity, school and dollar-wielding tourists blighted the character and culture of the rainforest? Achuar workers at Kapawi argue that leaving everything in the rainforest untouched is not an option. Some want to travel to the capital Quito or abroad to work and study. Others want to stay in the forest living traditionally in huts but with access to schools and air evacuation for medical treatment. That means dollars, which means saying yes to oil, logging or tourists. It took a year of intense negotiations before the Finae, the representative body of the 80,000-strong Achuar community, agreed to admit Kapawi in 1994, on the basis that lower-impact, lucrative tourism is the lesser of the evils. Kapawi pays the Achuar $2,000 a month and has a deal to hand over ownership of the lodge to them entirely in 2011. But all the time, the oil companies, with the Ecuadorian government's blessing, visit the Finae and offer them untold billions to let them tear up the forest. Senior Achuar guide and community leader Irar Washike, said the pressure from the oil industry was immense. 'But we have heard what has happened in the north and we will not let them build roads and bring contamination here,' he said. He believes that projects such as Kapawi are conservationist and he is desperate for the Finae to resist selling out to Big Oil. 'Most Achuar feel the same about this. Even if it was my own brother who got bribed, I would kill him to stop the oil companies getting in here.' Many believe the concept of ecotourism is at best a complex solution in a consumers' world, at worst an oxymoron. The dilemma is keenly felt in a country as vivid but fragile as tiny Ecuador. Back on board the Explorer II, one of the local naturalists remarked ruefully that the Jessica accident was an early warning of what could happen if Ecuador was careless with its priceless inheritance. 'But we haven't done so badly, despite being a poor country,' he remarked. 'If America or Europe owned the Galapagos islands or our rainforest I believe they would be covered in Holiday Inns and freeways by now.'

      "body": "<p>When 84-year-old Katherine Barnes stopped talking, her family assumed it was simply an inevitable stage in the slide towards Alzheimer's that began some years earlier. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, she became transfixed with terror every time her formerly beloved son-in-law entered the room of her nursing home, and her family told each other how sad it was that the illness was taking control so quickly. </p> <p>It was only when John Tiplady, owner of the \u00a3350-a-week Denison House nursing home in North Yorkshire, was arrested for sexual attacks on the elderly women in his care that the family began to piece together a number of strange incidents that had slipped their notice at the time. Katherine Barnes has since died. </p> <p>'Mother wasn't listed as a victim in the court case because the authorities didn't seem to want to go into it, but we have our doubts,' Glenda Ruddock, Katherine's daughter, told The Observer . 'None of the children whose mothers were abused knew what was going on and I don't know what's worse: thinking about what might have happened to my mother or knowing for certain that it did.' </p> <p>Tiplady, 64, was sentenced to four years in jail by judge Jonathan Crabtree, who told him that his actions were 'so disgusting as to be almost beyond belief'. That was in 1997. But The Observer has found that the sexual abuse of old people by care workers is still going on today and could be as common as that suffered by children in the days before the paedophile problem was recognised. </p> <p>'Anyone who bothers to look into it cannot fail to realise that the sexual abuse of elderly people in care homes is horribly prevalent,' said Ginny Jenkin, director of Action for Elder Abuse, whose helpline has received around 160 calls from frantic families and care homes since 1997 concerning extreme sexual abuse in care homes, a figure she says grossly underrepresents the true level of the abuse taking place. </p> <p>'People find it hard to understand why anyone would want to abuse an old person, but someone suffering some mental and physical frailty is the perfect victim: they can't defend themselves, they can't get away, and if they're able to communicate they're probably not believed. What more could any abuser want?' she said. </p> <p>'It's not about sex, it's about power,' she added. 'There are even pages on paedophile websites encouraging men finding it hard to access children to gain employment at care homes. They say the sex is just as good and there's far less risk of getting caught.' </p> <p>The number of those abused are unknown: a national survey has never taken place, despite attempts by campaigners to get the Government to fund the research. Jackie Pritchard, the country's sole specialist in this area, has been battling against scepticism and apathy for more than 15 years. </p> <p>'This sort of abuse is endemic in all but the best care homes,' she said. 'The whole spectrum of abuse, from inappropriate touching to rape, takes place in exactly the same way as child abuse took place in days gone past: there is exactly the same targeting of homes, the same grooming of particularly vulnerable victims, and the same patterns of mobility and planning in the abusers. It's a massive scandal just waiting to break. All we need is the government funding to prove it's as bad as we know it is.' </p> <p>More than 250,000 of the elderly population live in Britain's 23,000 residential and nursing homes, but the possibility that elderly people could be sexually abused by carers is one that even professional people find hard to comprehend. It was not until 1991, when the first paper written on the issue was published in America, that the subject was discussed. The US paper catalysed Malcolm Holt, a social worker with Northumberland County Council, to launch his own investigation. In two years Holt uncovered over 120 cases of serious sexual abuse around the country; 85 per cent involved victims over 75 and almost 90 per cent targeted those completely dependent on their abusers for care. </p> <p>After three years spent trying to gain the attention of a highly sceptical professional establishment, an exhausted Holt gave up. Since the publication of his paper in 1993, a resounding silence has enveloped the issue. 'Elder sexual abuse is the most hidden form of abuse in the country,' Holt maintained. 'In recent years, we have become accustomed to reports of elderly people being sexually assaulted and raped by strangers, but acknowledging that they are routinely sexually abused by carers is far more challenging.' </p> <p>One of the problems is the lack of regulations covering those who can work in residential homes. 'It's a totally unregulated workforce,' said Jenkin. Nurses struck off for abuse and refused work in nursing homes often gain employment in residential homes instead, hoodwinking home owners who, battling against a highly mobile and sparse workforce, routinely accept employees after the shortest of interviews without even checking references. </p> <p>Home owners have no obligation to check the criminal records of employees and Jenkin estimates that fewer than 5 per cent of homes bother to do so. Another concern is the lack of training that many care workers have received. Although training costs home owners \u00a3400, plus the cost of employing a part-time replacement, it would cost less than \u00a380 million for the Government to train every care worker in the country to a suitable NVQ level. </p> <p>The Government has gone some way towards acknowledging that abuse by care workers is a problem: by next year it aims to establish the national Protection of Vulnerable Adults list which, in the same way as List 99 already does for children, contains the details of all workers who have been dismissed or disciplined while working in care homes. </p> <p>But, according to Jenkin, the list is not enough. 'It won't include people who left homes under a cloud. We know from paedophiles how cunning and mobile these people are. This list will only include a fraction of the dangerous people targeting these homes.' </p> <p>Ruddock said: 'We did everything we could think of to ensure that our mother was safe and happy.' Denison House, set in five acres of countryside with a lake and large, airy rooms, had a waiting list of people to get in. 'It was charging over the odds for rooms but it was recommended by our doctor,' said Ruddock, who made an effort to know the staff and visited a number of times a week. </p> <p>'I can't bear the thought that I might have let her down like this,' she said. 'If something did happen, I can't stop wondering about how much she knew about it and how terrifying it must have been.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk\">amelia.hill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

In the first, this caring safe-sex bond flits from Gibraltar to Afghanistan via North Africa and Eastern Europe, and the colourful villains (Joe Don Baker and Jeroen Krabbe) are fully up to scratch. The other film pits him against Latin-American drug baron Robert Davi, his first truly ferocious foe since Red Grant. Less sex and fewer double entendres, but it's the first bond to attract a 15 Cert for violence. Desmond Llewelyn's Q has his largest role here. </p> <p><strong>The Thin Blue Line</strong><br> (1988, 15, BFI, 1988, VHS, Retail/Rental) <br>This riveting movie by one of the greatest living documentary makers, Erroll Morris, anatomises the Texas legal system and the underside of American life as it re-examines the case of the hapless out-of-state worker Randall Adams who was convicted on the flimsiest evidence of murdering a Dallas cop in the mid-1970s. His imaginatively organised film (the score is by Philip Glass) proved so persuasive that Adams was granted a full pardon. </p> <p><strong>The Battle of Algiers</strong><br> (1965, 5, Tartan, DVD/Retail)</p> <p>Ruthlessly analytical semi-documentary reconstruction of the early stages of the Algerian war of independence in the 1950s, made on the spot by Italian Marxists Gillo Pontecorvo (director) and Franco Solinas (screenwriter). One of the great political movies. Its sympathies are obvious but it respects its enemies and refuses to sentimentalise its local heroes. Score by Ennio Morricone.</p> <p><strong>Kind Hearts and Coronets</strong><br> (1949, U, Warner, DVD, Retail)<br> What is arguably the most perfect gem in the Ealing Studios crown is now available on DVD. In Robert Hamer's subtle late-Victorian black comedy, aggrieved social outcast Dennis Price is more than a match for the half a dozen aristocratic relatives, all impersonated by Alec Guinness, who stand between him and a seat in the Lords. Impeccably designed and acted (its great cinematographer Douglas Slocombe is still with us), it stands up to repeated viewing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Living Daylights (1987, PG, MGM, DVD/Retail/Rental) Licence to Kill (1989, 15, MGM, DVD/Retail/Rental) Timothy Dalton's two underrated appearances as 007, both directed by John Glen, are now available on DVD with numerous additional items, including interviews and 'making of' documentaries. In the first, this caring safe-sex bond flits from Gibraltar to Afghanistan via North Africa and Eastern Europe, and the colourful villains (Joe Don Baker and Jeroen Krabbe) are fully up to scratch. The other film pits him against Latin-American drug baron Robert Davi, his first truly ferocious foe since Red Grant. Less sex and fewer double entendres, but it's the first bond to attract a 15 Cert for violence. Desmond Llewelyn's Q has his largest role here. The Thin Blue Line (1988, 15, BFI, 1988, VHS, Retail/Rental) This riveting movie by one of the greatest living documentary makers, Erroll Morris, anatomises the Texas legal system and the underside of American life as it re-examines the case of the hapless out-of-state worker Randall Adams who was convicted on the flimsiest evidence of murdering a Dallas cop in the mid-1970s. His imaginatively organised film (the score is by Philip Glass) proved so persuasive that Adams was granted a full pardon. The Battle of Algiers (1965, 5, Tartan, DVD/Retail) Ruthlessly analytical semi-documentary reconstruction of the early stages of the Algerian war of independence in the 1950s, made on the spot by Italian Marxists Gillo Pontecorvo (director) and Franco Solinas (screenwriter). One of the great political movies. Its sympathies are obvious but it respects its enemies and refuses to sentimentalise its local heroes. Score by Ennio Morricone. Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949, U, Warner, DVD, Retail) What is arguably the most perfect gem in the Ealing Studios crown is now available on DVD. In Robert Hamer's subtle late-Victorian black comedy, aggrieved social outcast Dennis Price is more than a match for the half a dozen aristocratic relatives, all impersonated by Alec Guinness, who stand between him and a seat in the Lords. Impeccably designed and acted (its great cinematographer Douglas Slocombe is still with us), it stands up to repeated viewing.",

Lencten/lengten in Old English meant spring, literally the lengthening of hours of daylight 2. The 40 days Jesus spent alone in the wilderness gave rise to the word 'quarantine' from the Italian quarantina, meaning a period of 40 days 3. In the Christian calendar there are 45 days between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday but five are Sundays and are not included in the 40 days of fasting 4. The prohibition of eggs during Lent made popular the custom of eating pancakes on Shrove Tuesday and of giving eggs as gifts at Easter 5. Mardi Gras, literally 'fat Tuesday', is a major carnival in many countries, with dancing and feasting before the fast to come 6. George Bernard Shaw was an atheist, but thought Lent an excellent occasion 'for giving up reading other people's books' 7.

Ah, the Brits! I confess I had the very great pleasure of attending the infamous 'ceremony' at which Jarvis Cocker stormed the stage during Michael Jackson's performance of his hit 'I've Got A Great Big Wind-Machine (And A Children's Choir Too!)'.

So much so that if you had been 100 yards away from the stage in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion while Gwynnie was losing the plot over her 1999 Best Actress Oscar, you would probably just have thought it was cute. In TV close-up, however, everybody can squirm as a star screams, live and unrehearsed. </p> <p>To reiterate (while apparently straying slightly from the matter at hand), might I add that I was also at Wembley Stadium for Live Aid, in July 1985... and very much enjoyed watching U2 (on the big screens flanking the stage) during their performance in Philadelphia. </p> <p>Except that (I was informed much later) had I bothered to actually look at the stage, I might have noticed that U2 weren't in Philadelphia at all - in actual fact, they were in Wembley . To this day I swear it was an angle problem, rather than, say, a stupidity problem. </p> <p>However, a decade earlier, I was also fortunate enough to be seated courtside for the legendary Wimbledon men's single final battle between Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe and even at the time we all knew that this was gripping sporting history in the making, didn't we? </p> <p>Well, of course we didn't: my abiding memory is of being distracted from the action by a running commentary from the irritating woman sitting behind me. In short, exciting live events are often so much better on TV. </p> <p>So I sympathise with poor Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who almost missed receiving her prize at the recent Golden Globe awards because she was busy having a lipstick moment in the ladies - even for a star it is apparently quite easy not be somewhere even when you are. </p> <p>And on the one occasion when I was lucky enough to accept a gong myself, even that lovely moment was marred when I tottered up to the podium to be warned that of course I wouldn't be allowed to make a long and emotional speech - or indeed any speech at all ('it's not the bloody Oscars, Kathryn!'). </p> <p>Given that it wasn't televised, to this very day I occasionally wonder if I was even there. </p> <p> The Bafas are tonight on Sky 1 at 6.45pm (repeated tomorrow on BBC1, 10.35pm); the Empire Film Awards are on C4 tonight, 11.45pm; the Brit Awards are on ITV on Tuesday at 8pm</p>",

Almost 10 years ago I surveyed the films of a number of directors who had been uncharacteristically bold in their treatment of sex. Since that time, horizons have narrowed. As budgets balloon, studios increasingly shun anything as outr\u00e9 as adult sexuality. But sexuality is fundamental and far too dramatic a part of life to be chased from the big screen entirely. So, once again, I asked a group of directors to talk about sex in the movies, particularly in their own work. Their responses prove that celluloid sex is a dependably fascinating topic, however under siege it is at the moment. </p> <p>Some directors are far more squeamish about shooting sex scenes than moralising politicians might guess. 'I was raised in the Fifties, and I'm still such a prude,' says Don Roos, who directed the wry 1998 comedy The Opposite of Sex. In preparing to film a sex scene between Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow in Bounce , Roos reports: 'I just said \"Action!\" and left it to them. I was a wreck during the scene but they were fine about it. Gwyneth was like: \"Who is this nervous queen behind the camera?\" </p> <p>'Of course there was the added element that they had been a couple in real life, which made it even weirder for me. I thought I was where I shouldn't be - next to their bed, whispering words of encouragement.' </p> <p>Ang Lee, director of The Wedding Banquet, Sense and Sensibility, The Ice Storm and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, shares some of Roos' trepidation. 'I'm a shy person,' he says. 'So it's never easy for me to direct sex scenes. I try to block my mind, just give directions, and pretend I feel no embarrassment. In The Ice Storm there was a scene between Joan Allen and Jamey Sheridan in the front of a car. It was supposed to be freezing, but it was actually 80 degrees and they were in this tiny space. There were so many other things for them to focus on that it took their minds off the sex.' </p> <p>In Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Lee wanted to set aside his own discomfort and have some truly steamy sexuality in the scenes between the young lovers played by Zhang Zivi and Chang Chen. 'I wanted a passionate explosion,' Lee says. 'But she was only 19 and he was 21, so I had to be very explicit and tell them how to move their hands and exactly what to do. My approach is to encourage the actors to go as far as they're comfortable and then push them one stage further. A kiss is one of the hardest things to film because it is so difficult to photograph. The trick is finding where to place the camera. A real fight would look like a phoney fight on-screen, and the same is true of a kiss.' </p> <p>Anthony Minghella, director of The English Patient and The Talented Mr Ripley, has reasons other than personal unease for being less than eager to do sex scenes. 'I'd love to avoid shooting sex scenes because they can become very stock,' he says. ' The English Patient was a story that investigated different kinds of love - platonic love, love of country, love of exploration - so of course I had to include physical love. I made a few personal rules. If a scene was about intimacy, the actors would be naked. But if it was a sexual scene, they would be clothed. So when Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas repair to a back room during the Christmas party, they keep their clothes on. I still think it's a pretty steamy scene.' </p> <p>For the film's sexual scenes, Minghella instructed his actors in minute detail exactly what he wanted them to do. 'Usually I create the space for the actors to be free,' he says. 'But in the sex scenes I dictated every move. And I did that because I never forgot an interview I read with a stage actress talking about her first film. She said she had had all this classical training, and on her first day on a movie set she found herself in bed with a total stranger, left to her own devices, and she felt totally abandoned. I didn't want that to happen to my actors, so I would say, \"Put your hand here, move your head there.\" That removed responsibility from the actors, and the actors must feel protected from their own sexuality.' </p> <p>The question all directors face in doing a sex scene is whether audiences will go along with them. 'We all go through life in a modified state of high school,' says Neil LaBute, director of In the Company of Men and Nurse Betty. 'No one wants to be an outsider. So when people see a film they think, \"What's the norm?\" If it seems outside the norm they feel uncomfortable watching it. We're all too desperate for normality.' </p> <p>LaBute has established himself as one of the most daring provocateurs on the contemporary scene. Referring to his second feature, Your Friends and Neighbors, he says: 'I tried to do a whole film saturated in sexuality, even though I knew the American audience is wary of discussing it or seeing it. Actually you only see one sexual act, in the first scene. Ben Stiller and Catherine Keener had qualms about it, as they should have. I told them I wanted them to remain covered at every moment, and that gave them a technical challenge and helped to relieve the pressure. It also helped a great deal that we had a female cinematographer. It made the actors feel safer to have a woman's voice included. </p> <p>'I hope to return to the sexual arena in other films,' LaBute continues. 'In my view, sex should be considered like a controlled substance. The less you control it, the less dangerous and less mysterious it becomes, and the less people are obsessing it into something darker than it needs to be.' </p> <p>Like LaBute, director Michael Cristofer has shown an unfashionable willingness to push the limits of sex on screen. His first feature, Body Shots, was originally rated NC-17 and was resubmitted to the rating board numerous times before earning an R. His new movie, Original Sin , which stars Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie, was also slapped with an initial NC-17. 'I'm stupid,' Cristofer says, 'because I think people should have movies about things important to them, and sex and death would be high on that list. It is a battle to get that on screen.' </p> <p>In filming the steamy scenes between Jolie and Banderas, Cristofer had the advantage of willing actors. He had worked with Jolie in the daring, award-winning cable movie Gia, which was hugely important to her career. 'There was a level of trust between us,' he says. Banderas had an advantage in being a veteran of Pedro Almodovar's films. 'Antonio is a consummate professional,' says Cristofer. 'He's done every kind of sex from bondage to gay sex to heterosexual. And he's very protective of his image. </p> <p>'I tell actors that a sex scene has a purpose like any other scene. It brings the characters closer together or drives them apart. That gives the actors something to play besides the sex act. If they have nothing else to play, then you just have two people fucking and it's pornography.' </p> <p>'What's interesting in a film is sexual expectation or sexual tension,' says director Sydney Pollack. 'If you actually show graphic sex, something is diminished - unless you're a great artist. Nic Roeg did it in Don't Look Now, and that scene has been copied and copied. Even there, what you see is stylised, so you don't feel you're watching a stag movie.' </p> <p>Pollack is not known as a trailblazer in the field of cinematic sex, but The Way We Were included a memorable encounter between Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, and there are startling sexual moments in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? and in Absence of Malice, when Paul Newman practically rapes Sally Field to show her how a woman felt having her privacy violated in a newspaper article. </p> <p>'I like to use sex scenes to convey other ideas,' Pollack says. 'After that metaphorical rape in Absence of Malice, there's a romantic scene between Sally and Paul, but I didn't show much of it.' </p> <p>While the sexuality in Pollack's movies is usually implicit rather than explicit, Adrian Lyne has a reputation for brazenness. 'I'm much more interested in movies about sex than I am in The Matrix ,' he says. Years before he scrutinised nymphet-mania in his remake of Lolita, Lyne encouraged Michael Douglas and Glenn Close to overturn a few items while coupling in a kitchen in Fatal Attraction. 'If you don't get some element of humour into a sex scene there's a chance the audience will laugh anyway,' he observes. 'In this country especially, people feel uncomfortable watching sex in public, so I try to incorporate humour, like the scene of Douglas trying to get his pants off in Fatal Attraction.' </p> <p>Of his most famous film, 9 1/2 Weeks , Lyne says: 'Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger never spoke to each other except when they were working, and that added to the sense of unease I wanted. That movie interested me because all of us are attracted to the idea of being uncivilised for nine or 10 weeks. I know that Kim saw the movie as a way of legitimising her fantasy of doing something like that.' </p> <p>Lyne has some advice that might be useful to young directors looking for pointers on sex scenes: 'Actors are always nervous about how they look, so my job is to make them feel they look great,' he says. 'It doesn't hurt to give them a couple of drinks beforehand.' </p> <p> 9 1/2Weeks caused consternation within the US rating board, which is tougher on sex than violence on screen. Mary Harron also had a traumatic run-in with the rating board over American Psycho. She ended up having to cut 20 or 30 seconds from a three-way sex scene between Christian Bale and two hookers he hires for the evening. 'I was surprised the NC-17 was for that scene,' Harron says. 'I thought it might be for the chainsaw scenes, but the board had no objection to those. The three-way scene was meant to show what sex as a transaction is really like. At first I wasn't sure how I was going to shoot it, but then I told Christian to play it looking in the mirror, and I told the two girls to look bored, and that made it work. Everyone laughed a lot while we were shooting it.' </p> <p>Director Wong Kar-Wai takes a more laissez-faire approach to dealing with actors. His film Happy Together includes an explicit gay love scene between the two main characters, and he chose to shoot that on the very first day. 'I think it was the first time a famous Hong Kong star, Tony Leung, played a graphic gay scene,' he recalls. 'We set up the camera, and I said to the actors, \"Go to bed and do it.\" They worked it out themselves.' </p> <p>His new movie, In the Mood for Love, focuses on unrequited love between a man and a woman (Tony Leung again and Maggie Cheung) who are married to other people. Originally there was a sex scene between the two, but the director cut it out. 'We did that scene at the very beginning of the shooting,' he says, 'so in some respects, the way the actors walk and talk in every other scene is coloured by that love scene.' </p> <p>Actress/director Joan Chen was in one of the most memorably erotic movie scenes - a three-way sex scene under the silk sheets in The Last Emperor. '[Bernardo] Bertolucci often had a temper with the crew,' Chen says, 'but he was extremely gentle with the actors. He's in love with actors, and that makes you want to be beautiful for him.' </p> <p>Chen's directorial debut, the impressive Chinese-language film Xiu Xiu: the Sent-down Girl, involved the protagonist being forced into prostitution. A body double was used for the more graphic moments, but even so Chen says: 'The crew didn't want to go through with those scenes because they were so protective of the actress. But they were necessary for the film. I felt there should have been more sex. Even though it was extremely cruel, she was transformed by the experience, and so it should have been almost a transcendent moment. Instead it was done in a matter-of-fact way because we were so anxious to get it over with.' </p> <p>For her first Hollywood movie, Autumn in New York, Chen filmed Winona Ryder's first nude scene, a sexual encounter with Richard Gere, but the scene never made it into the film. 'When we tested the movie the audience was predominantly female, and because of the age difference between Winona and Richard they did not want to see her nude.' </p> <p>Among the new breed of indie directors, Kevin Smith (Chasing Amy, Dogma) shies away from showing sexual acts. 'Visually I'm not talented enough to bring it off, and maybe I'm too much of a Catholic ever to have those scenes. I don't know if I could have that conversation with an actor.' </p> <p>Smith's ultimate dismay, though, came about through circumstances that speak volumes about the problems he and other directors face. 'In Mallrats, the studio said we needed a pair of tits, and so there's a scene where Joey Lauren Adams opens her shirt. To me, that's a career low. Remembering that scene will chase me away from doing sex and nudity for a long time.' </p> <p> \u00a9 Stephen Farber </p> <p><strong>The Sexiest Scene I've Ever Seen</strong></p> <p><strong> Neil LaBute</strong> 'I loved what Gus Van Sant did in My Own Private Idaho in one sex scene with Keanu Reeves. It looked like a series of still photographs but wasn't.' </p> <p><strong> Anthony Minghella</strong> 'At the beginning of The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique there is a scene of Ir\u00e8ne Jacob making love that is incredibly intense and deeply felt. The French film Betty Blue is very sexy. There's a sequence in that movie where the man is naked and the woman is covered. Usually in movies the director goes to great lengths to hide the genitals when a man is getting out of bed, but that scene was the opposite of the norm.' </p> <p><strong> James Toback</strong> 'About half of Last Tango in Paris is actually quite bad. None the less, it has one of the most memorable and effective sex scenes, the famous scene with the butter. I always say be specific about the actors and the characters in any sex scene you attempt. Both Brando and Maria Schneider were believable in that scene.' </p> <p><strong> Wong Kar-Wai</strong> 'I found Hitchcock's Vertigo extremely erotic. Just Kim Novak's face in close-up is very exciting. Similarly, the scene in Psycho, of Anthony Perkins watching Janet Leigh through the peephole is erotic, because we're put in his position.' </p> <p><strong> Don Roos</strong> 'Most sex scenes seem funny to me, like the scene with the clay in Ghost. Or there are scenes where glasses and lamps go flying and curtains come off the rod. I have never knocked anything over during sex. To me, a good sex scene is Rhett Butler carrying Scarlett up a staircase.' </p> <p><strong> Ang Lee</strong> ' The Lover was a pretty sexy movie. In the Realm of the Senses was even more outrageous, but I still found it haunting. Of course, as a film it was actually more about lust than about love.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>Robin Maugham was born a Viscount, the son of a Lord Chancellor and the nephew of a hugely successful author and society figure, W. Somerset Maugham. He was given the best education money could buy and systematically groomed to live up to the highest of upper-class expectations. He also grew up in a time and a place, England in the 1930s and 1940s, in which the principal passion of his life - loving young, working-class men - was not only frowned on but illegal. Small wonder, then, that he called his end-of-career autobiography Escape from the Shadows. </p> <p>Since his death in 1981, the shadows have closed in again: unlike that of his more famous uncle, his work is now largely forgotten. There is one significant exception: his first novel, published in 1948, is still in print. </p> <p>Like most people, I first encountered The Servant as a film. As a teenager growing up in a small, conservative town, this potent cocktail of 1960s black-and-white nastiness provided everything I could have wanted from an unsupervised night out. Harold Pinter's screenplay, Joseph Losey's direction and Dirk Bogarde's acid performance created an unforgettable atmosphere of menace and unspoken perversion. Sexual frustration and class envy seethe below every facet of a tense, repressive, archetypically English surface. I was appalled, fascinated, hooked. </p> <p>It was only years later, reading the autobiography, that I realised that the story was first a novel. I was even more surprised to discover that what I had taken for fiction was, in essence, true. Tucked away in the autobiography is an admission that the central character - the eponymous servant himself - actually existed, and that his victim was the author. Hidden in the gory details of the tortured, licentious life is an account of a blackmail attempt. It takes place in his own house, and the blackmailer is a member of his own staff. Like all really good servants, this man has the uncanny knack of knowing what his master desires or requires without anything explicit being said. In this case, what he correctly surmises is that what his employer, the eminently respectable son of the Lord Chancellor, truly desires is a naked, face-down 14-year-old boy. </p> <p>Maugham assures us that in real life he simply turned down the offer. In fiction, pleasures this guilty were not to be so easily brushed aside. From this single, uneasily recalled incident, he elaborated the atmosphere and plot of an entire novel. The details are revealing. Maugham gave the blackmailer's victim his own address in Chelsea, his public-school education, his good looks, charm, independent income and addiction to alcohol. Tellingly, he also altered the self-portrait: the boy he is tempted with in the autobiography becomes a girl in the novel, and he is given a homosexual best friend, shifting the dirtiest of secrets on to another. </p> <p>But the demon remained unexorcised. Ten years later Maugham returned to The Servant, this time rewriting it as a West End play. It may seem odd that he chose to make something as public as a West End drama out of what was clearly a dangerously private matter, but he had his reasons. His writing was always dogged by comparison with that of his uncle. Despite a fairly debauched private life in the seclusion of his South of France villa, Somerset Maugham always skilfully concealed his homosexuality from his public, and reaped considerable rewards as a playwright. The Servant was a calculated attempt to challenge him on his own territory. Unfortunately, it was scheduled to open at the Connaught Theatre in Worthing. This was not in 1958 the ideal debut for a playwright eager to probe the open sores of sexual guilt and class envy. Maugham clumsily blurred the story in transferring it to stage, changing sexualities and genders and defusing its dark energies. A second rewrite, partly in response to the 1963 film, fared even worse. This time The Servant opened at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford. If Worthing was shocked, Guildford was baffled and the play has never had the London production its author intended. </p> <p>Now I've decided to give it just that. The story has stuck in my mind for 30 years. I find its dark geometry of addiction, perversion and damnation even more compelling as an adult than I did as a guilty teenager. However, the first thing I had to do before planning to stage it was to find a pair of actors who could live up to the images lurking in my imagination. </p> <p>In the same year I first saw the film I also saw an actor at the Old Vic playing Foster in Pinter's No Man's Land who was both sinister and alarmingly sexy; Michael Feast. His was the face and voice I still remembered 25 years later when casting Barrett, the servant himself. I met Jack Davenport, who is playing master to his servant, through his mother Maria Aitken while working with her on my first show at the Lyric Hammersmith, Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray . Later, after he'd seen some more of our work here, he expressed an interest in joining us. Young, handsome and willing: the perfect victim. </p> <p>The second thing I needed was a workable script. Conscious that the audience at the Lyric Hammersmith has rather sharper taste than that of the audience on The Servant 's previous opening nights, I asked Maugham's literary executors if I might create a new version of the play, one which removes the bowdlerisations of 1958 and restores the guilty ambiguity of the original, and they agreed. </p> <p>I've restored to the script some passages from the novel that intensify Maugham's trademark combination of eerie detachment with deep unease, his disquieting sense of refuse being handled with kid gloves. I've also shifted the setting to the date of Maugham's own last rewrite, the early 1960s. His deadly game of master and servant is now played out just off the King's Road at that iconic moment in London's history when the rot first really set in. The play is now revealed for what it is: a dissection of class and sex that is perhaps sharper and nastier than anything devised by his more respectable uncle. Now is perhaps the time for the other Maugham finally to come out of the shadows. </p> <p> Neil Bartlett's production of The Servant runs at Lyric Theatre Hammersmith London W6, from 8 March-21 April (020 8741 2311). </p> <p><strong>The Servant: The Film and its Impact</strong></p> <p>Nineteen sixty-three was a pivotal year for British cinema and the key film was Joseph Losey's The Servant . In retrospect we can see a major change coming over British cinema - Lindsay Anderson's This Sporting Life was the last fine gasp of provincial realism; Tony Richardson's Tom Jones discovered a lost exuberance in eighteenth-century England that proved the harbinger of Swinging London. But crucial was Losey, the embattled auteur who had put a firm personal signature (initially under pseudonyms) on whatever work, however uncongenial, came his way since arriving in London from Hollywood as a victim of McCarthyism a decade before. </p> <p>Losey began 1963 as a little-known figure with a devoted cult following. His nuclear-angst thriller The Damned opened as the lower half of a Hammer double-bill on Harrow Road in May and wasn't even press shown.

It was Losey's first wholly personal project in Britain, and began his important collaboration with Harold Pinter. Losey, a clever manipulator, started out in May to screen small previews of The Servant to win over opinion leaders. The invitations were delivered orally or handwritten and usually a few persuasive people associated with the picture were there to talk about it afterwards. These screenings of what many initially thought a disturbing, obscure movie were fortuitously accompanied by the rumours and public disclosures of the Profumo affair that began in the spring with bizarre stories of a shooting outside a mews apartment and escalated through Jack Profumo's denial and resignation, Stephen Ward's trial and Christine Keeler's jailing for perjury.

And it suggested through its discreet orgies and the celebrated restaurant scene a web of corruption that extended into every corner of society - even the church. It was a big hit in Venice and was rapturously received at its British premi\u00e8re in November, though it was never a popular success. In the year when Anthony Sampson's bestselling The Anatomy of Britain was published, Losey became our cinema's great observer and analyst of the contemporary scene. </p> <p>Philip French</p>",

      "bodyText": "Robin Maugham was born a Viscount, the son of a Lord Chancellor and the nephew of a hugely successful author and society figure, W. Somerset Maugham. He was given the best education money could buy and systematically groomed to live up to the highest of upper-class expectations. He also grew up in a time and a place, England in the 1930s and 1940s, in which the principal passion of his life - loving young, working-class men - was not only frowned on but illegal. Small wonder, then, that he called his end-of-career autobiography Escape from the Shadows. Since his death in 1981, the shadows have closed in again: unlike that of his more famous uncle, his work is now largely forgotten.

If it gets out of hand, it will grow into a full-scale insurgency casting the ethnic Albanians, once victims, as aggressors.</p> <p>Last week a standoff between troops and guerrillas in Macedonia came to an abrupt end when a television crew were held by a dozen or so gunmen in the Macedonian village of Tanusevci.</p> <p>Snezana Lupevska, a Macedonian TV journalist, spoke of her ordeal to The Observer last week. She and her crew were interrogated and robbed by the men, some in uniform and some wearing the badges of the Kosovo Liberation Army.</p> <p>The crew had gone to the village, where almost a third of the population is Albanian, to check reports that former ethnic Albanian fighters from Kosovo were training for attacks in Macedonia. What they found was that ethnic Albanian fighters not only controlled the village, but had been locked in a stand-off with Macedonian police and army units for six weeks.</p> <p>The news team's visit ended all that. In the four hours that followed their release, the army exchanged fire with the guerrillas around the village. Muzafer Xhaferi, a 22-year-old ethnic Albanian, was killed. The Macedonians say he was among gunmen shooting from the woods. His father says he was shot in the back, an innocent civilian.</p> <p>Yesterday the conflict escalated. Xhavier Xhaferi, a cousin of the dead man, came down the mountain on the Kosovo side of the border with his four children and his elderly mother. He said: 'It's almost war up there.

      "bodyText": "In the mountains on an uneasy border a new fire is smouldering in the Balkans. If it gets out of hand, it will grow into a full-scale insurgency casting the ethnic Albanians, once victims, as aggressors. Last week a standoff between troops and guerrillas in Macedonia came to an abrupt end when a television crew were held by a dozen or so gunmen in the Macedonian village of Tanusevci. Snezana Lupevska, a Macedonian TV journalist, spoke of her ordeal to The Observer last week. She and her crew were interrogated and robbed by the men, some in uniform and some wearing the badges of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The crew had gone to the village, where almost a third of the population is Albanian, to check reports that former ethnic Albanian fighters from Kosovo were training for attacks in Macedonia. What they found was that ethnic Albanian fighters not only controlled the village, but had been locked in a stand-off with Macedonian police and army units for six weeks. The news team's visit ended all that. In the four hours that followed their release, the army exchanged fire with the guerrillas around the village. Muzafer Xhaferi, a 22-year-old ethnic Albanian, was killed. The Macedonians say he was among gunmen shooting from the woods. His father says he was shot in the back, an innocent civilian. Yesterday the conflict escalated. Xhavier Xhaferi, a cousin of the dead man, came down the mountain on the Kosovo side of the border with his four children and his elderly mother. He said: 'It's almost war up there. The Macedonian army won't allow us into Macedonia. It's winter. We don't know where to go because we don't have any documents. The police up there are just playing with us.' The incident at Tanusevci has particularly alarmed observers because it happened not in the mountains of Kosovo or in the Presevo Valley in neighbouring southern Serbia, the scene of recent fighting between Kosovar secessionists and Serbian police.

The most serious incident, nine days ago, saw 11 Serbs murdered and dozens wounded in a bus bombing. 'We have known there have been men in uniforms operating in our border villages for over a month and a half,' says one senior Interior Ministry source in Macedonia. 'We have confirmed intelligence reports from both Serbia and Macedonia of the creation of a new group, using the initials UCK, that is call ing itself the National Liberation Army.' The senior official is acutely aware of the recent history of armed ethnic Albanian groups operating in the region's mountains and of how quickly they can grow from a handful of men into large-scale insurgencies. He knows too that joint Serbian-Macedonian action to push them out carries its own dangers. 'It is a serious dilemma. If we leave them there, we run the risk of the situation escalating.

In a country where you can be sued for serving scalding coffee, court cases are commonplace. But this one is different. Grahm is facing legal action because of a so-called suitcase clone. </p> <p>The story began in 1985, when Grahm imported a few Roussanne cuttings from Chteauneuf-du-Pape in the bottom of his Samsonite. This illegal practice is widely used by wineries that despair of obtaining good clones through the normal channels. And not only in California. </p> <p>Grahm cleaned up his cuttings, planted a vineyard and produced a brilliant Roussanne. So good was the wine that a local nursery, Sonoma Grapevines, asked for some cuttings. Warily, Grahm obliged. The cuttings were sold to various wineries; some won awards with the resulting wines. Things started to go wrong a year ago when one Napa Valley winery, Caymus, discovered that its Roussanne wasn't Roussanne after all. It was Viognier. </p> <p>In classic Californian fashion, owner Chuck Wagner is suing Sonoma Grapevines, which in turn is suing Randall Grahm. 'It's inexplicable,' says Grahm. 'Wagner is trying to make me out as a menace to the California wine industry.' Grahm says that he passed on the cuttings in good faith. 'I had the \"Roussanne\" planted next to some other Viognier vines and it was completely different in appearance.' </p> <p>The interesting thing is that the estate in Chteauneuf that gave Grahm the vines claims to have no Viognier in its vineyards. With the arrival of DNA testing, this won't be the first surprise to emerge from a European vineyard. 'I love the fact that there are strange and mysterious things out there that we don't understand,' says Grahm. </p> <p>It's all rather reminiscent of what happened in South Africa in the 70s, when Chardonnay cuttings were imported illegally from France and distributed throughout the Cape. The wines met with considerable success. One producer, Danie de Wet, won the Grand Prix d'Honneur with his 1985 Chardonnay at Vinexpo in 1987. Only it wasn't Chardonnay after all. The vines turned out to be supposedly inferior Gros Auxerrois from Alsace. </p> <p>Mix-ups happen all the time says Grahm, even when cuttings are legally sourced. 'It's not unusual to order Cabernet Sauvignon from a nursery and be sent Zinfandel instead.' He has a point. One young rootling looks much like another. Surely what really matters is the wine in the glass, not the grape variety from which it was made. </p> <p>Grahm's response to what he calls this 'storm in a teapot' has been to relabel his 2000 'Roussanne' as Viognier. 'The 1998 had Cyrano de Bergerac on the label, so for the 2000 we're going to replace him with Pinocchio and wrap his nose round the back of the bottle.

      "body": "<p>Healthy eating has crept up on me like an assassin. The fridge that was once a shrine to Sara Lee now boasts two tubs of goat's yogurt and a packet of miso. (Miso, bloody miso, in my fridge.) Right now you could probably find more to eat in Ally McBeal's stomach than in my larder. </p> <p>This column has always been a safe house for the salad shirker. A haven for those who cannot pass a cake shop. I know from some of your letters that alfalfa nibblers use this page in much the same way as a trucker uses the latest issue of Big and Bouncy . I have shared my sausages and pork crackling with you and passed round my trifle. I have tempted you with buttered muffins and let you lick my ice cream. But the sad, sickening truth is that a slice of super-triple-chocolate-chip-death-cake tastes twice as good when it comes round a bit less often. </p> <p>This does not mean I have embraced 'lite' eating. Nothing will ever get this cook to swap his butter for sunflower oil or knock up a recipe from the Canderel cookbook. If I am going to eat cake - and I am - then it will be made with butter, unrefined sugar, free-range eggs, chocolate and cream, but - and this a big but - it will be an occasional treat. A rare and exceptional luxury rather than a way of life. </p> <p>I have always believed in a balanced diet, but I am not sure the balance was right. The point is, though, that the chocolate cake must still come round. Saturated fat and sugar may be silent killers when taken in excess, but God, do they taste good. Look, I will go along with this fruit-and-vegetable lark, and I promise to eat my oily fish and pumpkin seeds, but on the condition that sugar and fat are allowed in there, too, albeit rather less often than they were. Chocolate, sugar, butter and red meat have a sensuality in the mouth that no portion of lightly steamed fish and wholewheat pasta ever can. There is a reason that McDonald's has queues, and it is not a shortage of tellers. </p> <p>What is essential is that when we decide to make biscuits or tuck into a sticky pudding, that we do so 100 per cent, with gusto, with the best ingredients and without stinting. Otherwise there is no point, and we might as well not have bothered. </p> <p>It is now possible to buy organically grown flours, unrefined sugars, unsalted butter and free-range, organic eggs in all but the most basic of grocers. Most towns have a health-food shop or a thoughtfully stocked deli that offers us something better than run-of-the-mill baking supplies. And decent chocolate, with more cocoa butter than sugar and anonymous fat, is no longer hard to find. </p> <p>One ingredient that will make a huge difference to the quality of your baking is the best-quality citrus peel. The ready-chopped stuff, with its layer of vegetable oil, has, to my taste at least, no discernible flavour. It seems to offer nought but sweetness and, it must be said, a sort of nibbly grittiness in the mouth. Italian grocer's shops, some of the better confectioners and some cake-supply companies sell whole pieces of preserved (candied) peel, and this is the stuff I recommend. It is often sold in plastic bags hanging from the ceiling, and is easily recognised as being a whole wedge of orange or citron peel. You will, boringly, have to cut it up yourself in the way early cookbooks suggest, but its inclusion will add a pleasingly sharp, fruity note to biscuits and cakes. Even those who loathe candied peel - and there are many - may well find they like it. </p> <p>And this is the crux of it. Sweet things should be a triumph of quality over quantity. I love a cake as much as anyone, but the facts are hard to ignore. The sausage sandwiches, steak-frites and, most of all, the pastries and puddings have never tasted more blissful than since I took up what is loosely called 'healthy eating'. Since second and third portions of anything but salad have been banned; every crumb of pastry, each chocolate truffle and every sugared almond has tasted like heaven itself. </p> <p>Yes, I feel better than I have ever done since tightening the reins on what and when I eat, but perhaps more importantly, what tasted good before now tastes even better. </p> <p><strong> Chocolate Florentines </strong></p> <p> Florentines are a bit of a fiddle, but worth every minute of your time. Made with sliced almonds and finest whole peel cut into dice rather than the ready-chopped stuff, and then dipped into the darkest chocolate, they are a different thing altogether from cake-shop Florentines. I would eat salad for a week just to get my hands on a couple of these. In fact, I just have. Makes about 20. </p> <p><strong> 60g undyed glac\u00e9 cherries</strong> <br> <strong> 100g chopped peel </strong> <br> <strong> 150g flaked almonds </strong> <br> <strong> 100g butter</strong> <br> <strong> 90g caster sugar </strong> <br> <strong> 3 tbsp double cream </strong> <br> <strong> 25g plain flour</strong> <br> <strong> 250g dark chocolate </strong></p> <p>You will also need two baking trays, lined with baking parchment or very lightly buttered and floured, and some non-stick baking parchment for cooling the finished biscuits. </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180 C/gas mark 4. Rinse the cherries in a sieve under running water to remove any excess syrup, then dry them with kitchen paper. (Don't skip this, otherwise their syrup will alter the texture of the uncooked mixture.) Chop them roughly. Chop the peel into small dice. Too large, and the biscuits will not hold together. Lightly crush the almonds with a rolling pin to break them up a little. </p> <p>Melt the butter in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the sugar and bring to the boil. Now pour in the cream, then stir in the cherries, chopped peel, almonds and flour. Stir for half a minute, then remove from the heat. </p> <p>Drop heaped tablespoons of the mixture on to the prepared baking sheets, leaving a 10cm gap between each. Pat the mixture down a little with the back of a spoon, then bake the first tray for 7 to 9 minutes, by which time the heaps will spread into loosely shaped biscuits. </p> <p>Using a round cookie cutter or a palette knife, ease the thin, loose edges of each 'biscuit' towards the centre, to give a neat, round biscuit about 8cm in diameter. </p> <p>Take the tray from the oven and replace it with the second one. As the Florentines cool, gently lift the edges of each with a palette knife. Don't try to hurry this - you need to be gentle and to keep an eye on when each Florentine is set enough to lift off. As each sets, transfer it with the palette knife to a cooling rack lined with non-stick baking parchment. Repeat until all the mixture is used up. </p> <p>When the biscuits are all cool and set firm, melt the chocolate in a small basin set over simmering water. Dip each biscuit into the chocolate so that the flat underside, and a little of each edge, is covered with chocolate. Turn each biscuit upside down to cool on the non-stick parchment. </p> <p><strong> A warm, moist banana cake</strong><br> </p> <p> I sometimes think there is an unwritten law that says banana cakes must be bland and rubbery. Not so this one. This is a deeply flavoured cake with an open texture. The smell of warm bananas fills the kitchen as it bakes. It has a pleasantly crunchy top, and its sweetness is capped by the dried apricots and yogurt.

      "bodyText": "Healthy eating has crept up on me like an assassin. The fridge that was once a shrine to Sara Lee now boasts two tubs of goat's yogurt and a packet of miso. (Miso, bloody miso, in my fridge.) Right now you could probably find more to eat in Ally McBeal's stomach than in my larder. This column has always been a safe house for the salad shirker. A haven for those who cannot pass a cake shop. I know from some of your letters that alfalfa nibblers use this page in much the same way as a trucker uses the latest issue of Big and Bouncy . I have shared my sausages and pork crackling with you and passed round my trifle. I have tempted you with buttered muffins and let you lick my ice cream. But the sad, sickening truth is that a slice of super-triple-chocolate-chip-death-cake tastes twice as good when it comes round a bit less often. This does not mean I have embraced 'lite' eating. Nothing will ever get this cook to swap his butter for sunflower oil or knock up a recipe from the Canderel cookbook. If I am going to eat cake - and I am - then it will be made with butter, unrefined sugar, free-range eggs, chocolate and cream, but - and this a big but - it will be an occasional treat. A rare and exceptional luxury rather than a way of life. I have always believed in a balanced diet, but I am not sure the balance was right. The point is, though, that the chocolate cake must still come round. Saturated fat and sugar may be silent killers when taken in excess, but God, do they taste good. Look, I will go along with this fruit-and-vegetable lark, and I promise to eat my oily fish and pumpkin seeds, but on the condition that sugar and fat are allowed in there, too, albeit rather less often than they were. Chocolate, sugar, butter and red meat have a sensuality in the mouth that no portion of lightly steamed fish and wholewheat pasta ever can. There is a reason that McDonald's has queues, and it is not a shortage of tellers. What is essential is that when we decide to make biscuits or tuck into a sticky pudding, that we do so 100 per cent, with gusto, with the best ingredients and without stinting. Otherwise there is no point, and we might as well not have bothered. It is now possible to buy organically grown flours, unrefined sugars, unsalted butter and free-range, organic eggs in all but the most basic of grocers. Most towns have a health-food shop or a thoughtfully stocked deli that offers us something better than run-of-the-mill baking supplies. And decent chocolate, with more cocoa butter than sugar and anonymous fat, is no longer hard to find. One ingredient that will make a huge difference to the quality of your baking is the best-quality citrus peel. The ready-chopped stuff, with its layer of vegetable oil, has, to my taste at least, no discernible flavour. It seems to offer nought but sweetness and, it must be said, a sort of nibbly grittiness in the mouth. Italian grocer's shops, some of the better confectioners and some cake-supply companies sell whole pieces of preserved (candied) peel, and this is the stuff I recommend. It is often sold in plastic bags hanging from the ceiling, and is easily recognised as being a whole wedge of orange or citron peel. You will, boringly, have to cut it up yourself in the way early cookbooks suggest, but its inclusion will add a pleasingly sharp, fruity note to biscuits and cakes. Even those who loathe candied peel - and there are many - may well find they like it. And this is the crux of it. Sweet things should be a triumph of quality over quantity. I love a cake as much as anyone, but the facts are hard to ignore. The sausage sandwiches, steak-frites and, most of all, the pastries and puddings have never tasted more blissful than since I took up what is loosely called 'healthy eating'. Since second and third portions of anything but salad have been banned; every crumb of pastry, each chocolate truffle and every sugared almond has tasted like heaven itself. Yes, I feel better than I have ever done since tightening the reins on what and when I eat, but perhaps more importantly, what tasted good before now tastes even better. Chocolate Florentines Florentines are a bit of a fiddle, but worth every minute of your time. Made with sliced almonds and finest whole peel cut into dice rather than the ready-chopped stuff, and then dipped into the darkest chocolate, they are a different thing altogether from cake-shop Florentines. I would eat salad for a week just to get my hands on a couple of these. In fact, I just have. Makes about 20. 60g undyed glac\u00e9 cherries 100g chopped peel 150g flaked almonds 100g butter 90g caster sugar 3 tbsp double cream 25g plain flour 250g dark chocolate You will also need two baking trays, lined with baking parchment or very lightly buttered and floured, and some non-stick baking parchment for cooling the finished biscuits. Preheat the oven to 180 C/gas mark 4. Rinse the cherries in a sieve under running water to remove any excess syrup, then dry them with kitchen paper. (Don't skip this, otherwise their syrup will alter the texture of the uncooked mixture.) Chop them roughly. Chop the peel into small dice. Too large, and the biscuits will not hold together. Lightly crush the almonds with a rolling pin to break them up a little. Melt the butter in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the sugar and bring to the boil. Now pour in the cream, then stir in the cherries, chopped peel, almonds and flour. Stir for half a minute, then remove from the heat. Drop heaped tablespoons of the mixture on to the prepared baking sheets, leaving a 10cm gap between each. Pat the mixture down a little with the back of a spoon, then bake the first tray for 7 to 9 minutes, by which time the heaps will spread into loosely shaped biscuits. Using a round cookie cutter or a palette knife, ease the thin, loose edges of each 'biscuit' towards the centre, to give a neat, round biscuit about 8cm in diameter. Take the tray from the oven and replace it with the second one. As the Florentines cool, gently lift the edges of each with a palette knife. Don't try to hurry this - you need to be gentle and to keep an eye on when each Florentine is set enough to lift off. As each sets, transfer it with the palette knife to a cooling rack lined with non-stick baking parchment. Repeat until all the mixture is used up. When the biscuits are all cool and set firm, melt the chocolate in a small basin set over simmering water. Dip each biscuit into the chocolate so that the flat underside, and a little of each edge, is covered with chocolate. Turn each biscuit upside down to cool on the non-stick parchment. A warm, moist banana cake I sometimes think there is an unwritten law that says banana cakes must be bland and rubbery. Not so this one. This is a deeply flavoured cake with an open texture. The smell of warm bananas fills the kitchen as it bakes. It has a pleasantly crunchy top, and its sweetness is capped by the dried apricots and yogurt. At its best eaten warm - with some thick, cold yogurt or cream on the side, this can be served as pudding or tea-time cake. Serves 8-10. 125g ready-to-eat dried apricots 200g plain flour 2 tsp baking powder tsp salt 4 ripe bananas 2 tbsp natural yogurt 150g butter 175g golden caster sugar 3 free-range eggs thick, natural yogurt to serve Line the base of a 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin with greaseproof paper. Preheat the oven to 170 C/gas mark 3. Chop the apricots, but not too finely (pieces the size of a raisin should be small enough). Mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. I know this seems like a lot of salt, but it really brings out the flavour of the banana. Peel the bananas, put them in a basin and mash them to a pulp with a fork, then stir in the yogurt. In a large basin or electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar till light and quite fluffy. Add two of the eggs, one at a time, beating them into the mixture, then add a couple of tablespoons of the flour - this is simply to stop the mixture curdling - then the remaining egg. The mixture should be thick and creamy. Scrape in the mashed banana and yogurt and then the chopped apricots, then fold them into the creamed butter and sugar mixture. Using a large, metal spoon - which is less likely to knock the air out than a wooden one - fold the flour, baking powder and salt into the butter and sugar, taking deep, firm, slow stirs. Scoop into the lined cake tin and bake for 1hr 15 minutes. The case will have risen and cracked slightly across the top. The cake is ready when a thin metal skewer is pushed into the deepest part and comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and leave, still in its tin, for 20 minutes or so to calm down. Slide a palette knife around the edge of the cake and remove it from the tin, then place it on a plate to cool a bit, but do serve it warm - its flavour will be deeper.",

This was because, despite my middle-class upbringing in the cherry-blossom suburbs, I was desperate to become the kind of boy my mother had warned me about. I was certain that the correct footwear was what I needed, that it would make me appear very hard indeed. As I realised a few years later, the reality was altogether sadder: as an adolescent I had, by choice, started wearing shoes so sensible as to make a chiropodist's heart beat faster with pleasure. They did not pinch. They gave marvellous support. And they protected me against injury. Not so much hard, then, as hardy. </p> <p>Which all goes to show that, while some fashions are as silly and nipple-chafing as a chicken-wire basque, others also happen to be eminently worthwhile. The current and growing vogue for authentic Spanish food - at least in London - has to be one of them. It began with Moro, a clam's throw away from The Observer 's offices, which opened on Exmouth Market in April 1997, with a gutsy menu of Iberian and North African dishes which proved that Spanish food does not have to begin and end at platters of curling, cooling tapas. Their cookbook is published in May by Ebury Press. More recently, the ludicrously named Paell'Ya opened in south London offering platefuls of what are, by all accounts, very good versions of the quintessential Spanish rice dish; likewise Claudio Pulze's upmarket Cuisine Collection restaurant group has opened El Rincon to good reviews. (I can only report as I read, having not been there; I don't get out much, you know.) </p> <p>Now comes Cigala, which also wanted to call itself El Rincon but had to dump the name because the other lot had got there first. Just to add to the sense of this being a small restaurant genre, the chef and owner at Cigala, Jake Hodges, was formerly a partner in Moro, and the manager and a few of the other staff used to work there, too. You probably don't give a damn about this sort of stuff, but believe me, in the world of Spanish restaurants they talk of nothing else. </p> <p>Being at the cutting edge of food fashion, the restaurant is a bright white minimalist space of stripped floorboards and plain, bleached-out surfaces, with an open kitchen in one corner. You definitely wouldn't want to have a nose bleed in there for fear of introducing too much colour into the room and frightening the waiters. It is, though, perfect for lunch on a sunny winter's day, the room flooding with watery light. The effect is utilitarian and business-like without being severe - and the service equally so. </p> <p>My companion, a Pat who is not my wife, is a long-standing fan of Moro and was eager to try the food at what is, almost, its offspring. We began with a glass of dust-dry fino sherry, a taste for which I consider to be almost as much a sign that you have reached adulthood as the ability to hear the William Tell Overture without shouting, 'Hi Ho Silver Away!' I'm not sure I could yet pass that test, but I did like the crisp bite of the sherry. </p> <p>The menu, which changes daily, has half-a-dozen starters and main courses, all moderately priced, the more so at lunchtime, when there is a three-course set menu for \u00a318. Happily, everything we wanted was also on that set menu, not that we were entirely sure what that everything was. My starter of partridge escabeche, for example, came with herb salad and something called banderillas. According to Pat, banderillas are the spear-type things with which bulls are dispatched during bull fights. It brought to mind the troubling image of tiny little game birds being brought to ground by cape waving, pert-buttocked young men wielding sharp, oversized weapons: on this plate, happily, it was just a fancy name for a cocktail stick spearing some pickled chillies and olives. </p> <p>The partridge was not a true escabeche, in which the meat is 'cooked' from raw in citrus juice. It clearly had been cooked before hand. But that is only an observation, rather than a complaint. It was a lovely piece of tender, sprightly bird, stridently seasoned. Pat began with a simple salad of red peppers, tomatoes and green beans which was, she said, the straightforward assembly of great ingredients she had hoped it would be. </p> <p>For her main course, she had grilled red mullet with escalivada, which turned out to be a kind of soft, Spanish ratatouille, complete with the smoky, char-grilled taste of the roasted peppers. It was, she said, terrific, and from the mouthful I was allowed, I agreed. I had the classic combination of marinated pork with clams in a rich tomato and wine sauce, the remains of which I despatched with lumps of their thick crusty bread. It was bold, rib-sticking stuff. </p> <p>There were only two pudding choices on the set menu, so we had them both. An apple flan was more of a custard and, while there was a touch of the nurseries to the dish, it was not at all cloying. The whisky tart was a true confection: ice cream on the bottom, whisky-soaked sponge in the middle and crisp toffee on the surface. I mean, really, what's not to like? </p> <p>Had we ordered these dishes off the carte, the bill for food would have come in at \u00a345. Using the set menu it cost just \u00a336, which really is good value for uncluttered and deft regional cooking of this calibre. With our sherries, water, coffee and service, the total bill only just broke \u00a350 which, again, is a bit of a steal. What's more, I'm sure they wouldn't even bat an eyelid if you ate there wearing Doc Marten boots, and next time I go there I just might try it.

      "body": "<p>Once again British farming is in a state of shock. Once again consumers are in a state of bewilderment. Once again consumers are being asked to pay the price for a system of agriculture and food production which, time after time, has shown itself to be deeply flawed. </p> <p>We have had, and continue to have, listeria, salmonella, BSE, E. coli, swine fever and infectious anaemia in farmed salmon. We now have foot-and-mouth for the first time since 1981. And yet the root cause of each of these disasters is the same: the policy that we must produce as much food as we can, as cheaply as we can. </p> <p>So ingrained has the concept of cheap food become that it seems impossible now to eradicate it from the political process, institutional planning and the public mind. Yet no one seems to stop to count the true cost of 'cheap food'. </p> <p>For a number of years the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been following a covert policy of closing down 'red meat' abattoirs. The theory was that there were too many of them to be viable - and it was true that many of them were badly run. </p> <p>Under the guise of implementing EU regulations, MAFF set about closing the smaller ones, and centralising the slaughter of animals in large units. The logic behind this had little to do with the EU - it would have been easy to bring the smaller abattoirs up to standard over a reasonable period - and much to do with economies of scale. </p> <p>Never mind that animals would become more stressed because they would have to travel greater distances to be slaughtered. Never mind the greater chances of infectivity in the case of an outbreak of disease. The costs of slaughter would be reduced. Meat would be cheaper. The public would be appeased. </p> <p>So, between 1985 and 2000, the number of abattoirs fell from 1,022 to 387. Over the same period, the average number of animals killed each week has risen from 13,313 per abattoir to 32,729. The consequences of this policy have been made evident by the course of the latest outbreak of foot-and-mouth. When the first case was identified, the focus of investigation fell on Cheale Meats in Little Warley, Essex. It has since been established that more than 600 farms, from as far away as Northumberland, Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Isle of Wight, Northern Ireland and Scotland, send their meat there. </p> <p>Given the fact that the foot-and-mouth virus is so highly contagious and can be transmitted by living animals or in the carcases of dead ones, it is easyto see the potential for contamination. It may well turn out, of course, that the true source of the outbreak is traced to meat imported from another part of the world - all in the name of cheap food - and so we can pass the buck. But we have to accept the blame ourselves because we have institutionalised the whole notion of cheap food. </p> <p>The original reasons behind the cheap food policy, conceived in the wake of World War II, may have been worthy, but the case for change is now overwhelming. The drive for cheap food has been behind every major food catastrophe of the past decade. </p> <p>BSE was caused by the use of ground-up animals for feed because they were a cheap form of protein. Salmonella is endemic in chickens and their eggs because the broiler system delivers cheaper poultry products. E. coli is a by-product of intensive livestock practices.

      "bodyText": "Once again British farming is in a state of shock. Once again consumers are in a state of bewilderment. Once again consumers are being asked to pay the price for a system of agriculture and food production which, time after time, has shown itself to be deeply flawed. We have had, and continue to have, listeria, salmonella, BSE, E. coli, swine fever and infectious anaemia in farmed salmon. We now have foot-and-mouth for the first time since 1981. And yet the root cause of each of these disasters is the same: the policy that we must produce as much food as we can, as cheaply as we can. So ingrained has the concept of cheap food become that it seems impossible now to eradicate it from the political process, institutional planning and the public mind. Yet no one seems to stop to count the true cost of 'cheap food'. For a number of years the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been following a covert policy of closing down 'red meat' abattoirs. The theory was that there were too many of them to be viable - and it was true that many of them were badly run. Under the guise of implementing EU regulations, MAFF set about closing the smaller ones, and centralising the slaughter of animals in large units. The logic behind this had little to do with the EU - it would have been easy to bring the smaller abattoirs up to standard over a reasonable period - and much to do with economies of scale. Never mind that animals would become more stressed because they would have to travel greater distances to be slaughtered. Never mind the greater chances of infectivity in the case of an outbreak of disease. The costs of slaughter would be reduced. Meat would be cheaper. The public would be appeased. So, between 1985 and 2000, the number of abattoirs fell from 1,022 to 387. Over the same period, the average number of animals killed each week has risen from 13,313 per abattoir to 32,729. The consequences of this policy have been made evident by the course of the latest outbreak of foot-and-mouth. When the first case was identified, the focus of investigation fell on Cheale Meats in Little Warley, Essex. It has since been established that more than 600 farms, from as far away as Northumberland, Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Isle of Wight, Northern Ireland and Scotland, send their meat there. Given the fact that the foot-and-mouth virus is so highly contagious and can be transmitted by living animals or in the carcases of dead ones, it is easyto see the potential for contamination. It may well turn out, of course, that the true source of the outbreak is traced to meat imported from another part of the world - all in the name of cheap food - and so we can pass the buck. But we have to accept the blame ourselves because we have institutionalised the whole notion of cheap food. The original reasons behind the cheap food policy, conceived in the wake of World War II, may have been worthy, but the case for change is now overwhelming. The drive for cheap food has been behind every major food catastrophe of the past decade. BSE was caused by the use of ground-up animals for feed because they were a cheap form of protein. Salmonella is endemic in chickens and their eggs because the broiler system delivers cheaper poultry products. E. coli is a by-product of intensive livestock practices. ISA in salmon is caused by the broiler system being applied to fish. The consequences for the consumers, and the active part we play in the perpetuation of the policy, are equally dire - vCJD, food poisoning and obesity. We love cheap food. We binge on it. Diet-related diseases kill more people in the West than any other cause. We eat too much, diet too much, worry too much about our figures. Yet still we advocate keeping food as cheap as possible. Instead of promising to perpetuate the discredited policies which have reaped such bitter harvests, the Government should embark on a policy of de-intensifying agriculture, scrapping false economies of scale and ensuring that a realistic price is charged for the results. And we, as consumers, must accept our responsibilities and be prepared to pay for food that is produced up to a quality, not down to a price. Until we are, the outbreaks of foot and mouth, BSE, E. coli and their like will continue.",

      "body": "<p>The buds are already pea-sized on the hawthorn. But not all. Some branches are an undressed tangle of thorny branches, still buried in winter. It is curious the way that hawthorn breaks into leaf and flower at such a different rate. Drive along any new ring road in March and you will see the hedges erupting in a zany patchwork of leaf, even though you can be sure that all the plants will be the same type (hawthorn), same age, planted on the same day(ish). Odd. This is because most commercial hawthorn has been bred from stock that originated in the Balkans, where spring comes suddenly after harsh winters and before an equally harsh summer. </p> <p>So it has adapted to use this short spring to break into leaf fast and to produce viable seed as quickly as possible. This genetic disposition remains the trigger dictating the cycle of the plant. So, a mile of hedging from three different gene stocks will obey three different genetic time switches, coming into leaf, blossom and fall independently of each other. But all of the 200,000 miles of hawthorn hedges planted across the agricultural landscape in the great enclosure periods of the 18th and 19th century came from home-grown stock which reacts, from parish to parish, county to county, within the same climatic zone - as if by one prearranged signal. </p> <p>And nothing - no recreational chemical, no music, no wonder on this earth - is so thrilling as the first realisation, on a fine March evening, that the hawthorn hedges are starting to dance with leaf. For the first week the new green hovers above the undressed shape of hedge, half-memory half-botany. Then it seems to settle down slowly upon each plant, green layering on impossibly bright green. Just writing this makes me sick with longing. Sarah longs for travel and new places, the world tantalisingly unvisited. I long for spring and the unfurling of seasons in the same way. The thought of missing it, of not being there when it is happening, is unbearable. And it has already led me astray. It is the thorniness of hawthorn, among other plants, that I began to bash into this keyboard. Hijacked by incipient foliage. But there is a connection. Sarah thinks of the coppice as the spinney. We all recreate and reinvent our pasts, and spinneys have the same kind of symbolic significance to her as coppices do for me. The two merge nicely about three-quarters of the way down the garden. </p> <p>There were spinneys up my lane, too. Thin slivers of wood, hardly more than swollen hedges, allowed to exist only to cover for pheasants. They were fine places for children to play in - a hidden, safe world like a long, thin boat and from which you could look out across the fields to port and starboard. The origins of spinneys were woods that consisted of thorns. These were cared for to provide spiky, stock-proof material (called trouse) to mend gaps in hedges until the hedge grew back. Hawthorn is best because it grows fast and thick and is spiky enough to stop anyone or thing pushing through. It is also as tough as anything, will get dense if cut and can be laid every 20 years or so to provide an impassably solid barrier. But it has never quite made the grade as a garden hedge or tree - mainly, I suspect because it is so common outside the garden and so firmly fixed as an agricultural feature - rather like cutting the lawn with a combine harvester. </p> <p>But don't overlook the humble hawthorn, Crataegus monogyna . It will grow in almost any soil or position, has lovely flowers, berries or haws, cuts to any shape, is ideal cover for birds and is about the cheapest tree that you can buy. By the by, it is also, in my opinion, the best wood for burning on an open fire. If this is all too remotely arcadian, then consider the more refined and exotic cockspur hawthorn, Crataegus crus-galli . This has spikes 3in long attached to a handsome tree small enough for most urban back gardens. </p> <p>Thorns 3in long start to get scary, but none are as intimidating as those of blackthorn ( Prunus spinosa ). Some of this is due to the size of its spikes - fully as long and vicious as the cockspur whitethorn - and the terrible malignancy within them. I met a man who had lost his hand from a single blackthorn spike that wedged in the joint of his thumb, flared into septicaemia and could not be saved. Most are not so quick to anger but in my experience all hurt and unless you get rid of them within a few hours, go septic. </p> <p>I have a pair of pigskin hedge-layer's gloves that are truly thorn-proof and get used for pruning the more vicious roses as well as cutting blackthorn, but not the sort of thing you find in the average out-of-town DIY emporium. However, if you do have a blackthorn hedge, always wear goggles when you trim it - a tiny piece of thorn in your eye can blind you. But skewered onto the thorns of every spiky plant are the flowers that will be breaking into bloom around now. And the fruit of these flowers - sloes - makes the best winter-warming toddy when turned into sloe gin. </p> <p>We have a couple of robinias, R pseudoacacia 'Frisia', that have a full set of squat barbs. Without leaves, these trees are charmless things without much form and lacking the aura of potential that empowers many young trees (this is a whole separate subject, but I get increasing pleasure from seeing trees grow that will not reach maturity until my grandchildren are older than I am now). They only tolerate our garden - it's too wet and too cold for their comfort - but when they do eventually come into leaf, very late, they have a wonderful golden head. </p> <p>There isn't space here to celebrate or do justice to the full range of rose thorns, save to mention my two favourites. The first is a horticultural clich\u00e9, Rosa sericea pteracantha , with its fabulous wedges of translucent thorns. It must be the only plant grown exclusively for its thorns. The flowers are small and red, but no one would grow it for them alone. Always plant it so that you can appreciate the thorns when backlit - preferably in the evening when the sun is lower for longer. The other rose I'd grow just for its thorns - if its flowers were not so charming or its bark so deliciously plum-coloured or its autumn leaves the colour of beaten gold leaf - is R willmottiae . Each of its thorns zigzags away from the one above and below, making a graceful geometric pattern. No other plant quite so relieved the gloom of last autumn as this.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>Someone told me the other day that my life - as evinced from these pages - was wholly enviable. Even if that were desirable and true (wrong on both accounts) it would not be believable unless the picture was drawn by an objective observer. The truth is, dear reader, that I edit my life on these pages to suit myself. I don't lie, but I edit like mad. </p> <p>So, the reality is that I sit here, on a filthy grey Saturday, feeling like something the cat has given up on eating, wondering if everyone feels as tired, ill and fed up as this. Of course you do. If I felt like this and did not have a garden I'd be in trouble. Real trouble. But even though I know I will do very little outside today, I also know that the garden waits for me, albeit with the impatience of a dog longing for a walk. </p> <p>My filming commitments have all but wiped out three weeks of January and February and the longer one is away from the garden the harder it is to get back into the rhythm. When I am daily connected to the place I can crack on within seconds of stepping outside. I get a lot done. When I have been away I struggle to get going, flicking from thing to thing. I hate this and have real sympathy for the novice gardener who, with all the best intentions in the world, does not quite know where or how to get going. </p> <p>However, to kick-start myself into action I did two things yesterday: I bought a new pair of secateurs and I pruned all the late-flowering clematis. I say 'all' as though there were dozens of the things, but in fact there are 15, all grown up tripods in the Jewel garden. Every year, one or two of them get clematis wilt and I assume the whole lot will collapse overnight. It never happens. Strange. But I do mulch them all thickly, as much to keep the plant well buried as to feed them. The affected ones inevitably grow back through this mulch, reduced but oblivious to their prior affliction. </p> <p>I also started pruning the roses. This feels like artistry, whereas the clematis cutting is as artistic as mowing the lawn. I have found that almost all the shrub roses do much better for an annual once-over. Unlike hybrid teas or floribundas, you still want a good shape and structure when you have finished cutting. I only have one floribunda, 'Dusky Maiden', which is very red and flowers endlessly from June to December. And I pruned the buddleja, cornus and sambucus. But I didn't clear them up. That's a minus thing.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: Hedging your bets and sowing seed potatoes</strong></p> <p> Early June is probably the best time to trim an established thorn hedge. If you want it to flower next spring, do not cut it again. If you want neatness above floriferousness, give it another trim in autumn to reduce the number of mildew spores that overwinter in the outer buds. </p> <p>Prune late-flowering clematis, cutting right back to the second-lowest bud. Mulch thickly after pruning with an organic compost. </p> <p>It is time to chit your seed potatoes. If you do not have them, buy them and put them on a cool windowsill, either on a tray or in eggboxes. They will develop tight green buds and grow much faster as a result when you plant them in a month or so's time. </p> <p>Do not be tempted to plant or sow too early. Put your time and energy into preparing the soil and warming and drying it with polythene and/or horticultural fleece. Clear polythene will keep the rain off but let the sun in, and a layer of fleece over a seed bed for a few weeks before sowing will warm the ground. After you have sown your seeds or planted your onion sets, put the fleece back on. It works as well as a cloche.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When David Davies recently said England could win the World Cup in 2006 it sounded like the sort of boastful jingoism Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson could probably do without. You need someone like G\u00e9rard Houllier to say the same thing for anyone to sit up and take notice. </p> <p>The Liverpool manager has long been a fan of English football, and his knowledge of English players is superior to Eriksson's. In charge of up to half a dozen present and future internationals at Anfield, and himself a foreign coach responsible for bringing about the sort of rapid and tangible improvement that has just taken the pride of Serie A by surprise, Houllier believes the upcoming generation of English talent is the most exciting he has seen anywhere at any one time. </p> <p>Coming from a man who was closely involved in the winning of the last World Cup, that is quite a compliment. Eriksson may not appreciate the pressure being steadily cranked up as he prepares for his first game as England manager on Wednesday, but the former French technical director is specific about what England can expect. </p> <p>'I don't think Eriksson has taken the job at quite the ideal time because it's difficult at the moment,' Houllier said. 'He's trapped in a situation where he has old players on the verge of retiring but his young players are still too inexperienced. I don't believe you can have a big swap at international level, you have to bring your young players through gradually. At the same time, Eriksson needs results, and you can't get results without experience, so he can't get rid of his old players just like that. I don't expect a lot from England in 2002, but, with the crop of young players you have, this country should be a force in 2006 and 2008. Your young players are good now and if they stay focused and fit they will become better and better.' </p> <p>The conditional is necessary because Houllier accepts that English football is not always straightforward, that career paths are not as easily plotted as they might be in other countries. He contends that England have around 40 'outstanding' prospects between the ages of 18 and 23 - roughly twice as many as any of the other leading footballing nations - but knows there is no guarantee there will be the same number of fully developed internationals five or six years down the line. 'The crop is outstanding, but it's down to your players now to see what they want to achieve,' Houllier said. 'It's a matter of personality and of willpower, because this is a job that gives you a lot of money and a lot of free time. But the demands of top-level football are so high now you have to live for the job. The minute you start using the job as a means to live well you are on your way down. English football is only just cottoning on to this. The French, for example, are amused by the idea of a booze ban. They keep asking me why on earth England internationals were allowed to booze before. I'm not saying French players never have a drink, don't get me wrong, but they do it at the right time. So this is an interesting period for English football. It could be a turning point. It all depends on how the next generation develops.' </p> <p>Noted Anglophile that he is, Houllier has every confidence. Anyone who has resurrected Robbie Fowler's career is entitled to have. It might have been necessary to point to the door a few times along the way, but, although Houllier has been willing to take a firm stance, he does not see himself as a hard man. 'I believe you get more results by convincing people of the value of your ideas, rather than being a dictator,' he explained. </p> <p>Houllier ruffled a few feathers at Anfield by importing foreigners wholesale, but he has sold as well as bought and has been careful to build the team around an English core. Between them, Liverpool and Manchester United could supply the whole of the England outfield, a fact of which Houllier is proud. </p> <p>'I believe in English players, first of all,' he said. 'I like their effort, their heart, I like the way the chest gets a little bit bigger when the game comes around. When I came here, the first thing I said was that I wanted a British core to the club, and I will always try to keep it. I don't know whether it's the same for Arsenal or Chelsea, but I just feel it is right for this club. I tried to buy British at first, but of course the prices were totally out of order, more than I could afford to spend. I was interested in Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell, but could not get them. So we went down the foreign route, although I still managed to buy Emile Heskey and Nick Barmby. Those two England players represent a third of my spending.' </p> <p>Which other English players would Houllier go for given the chance? 'I'd have Joe Cole and Michael Carrick any time,' he said. 'You can say I'm interested in them if you like. Harry Redknapp will be furious, but he knows how good they are.' Perhaps fearing Sir Alex Ferguson's fury more than the West Ham manager's, Houllier stops short of coveting Wes Brown, but his admiration for the Manchester United defender is equally high. 'He is going to be very good indeed,' he said. 'He's quick and aggressive. He caught Michael Owen twice in our last game against United, and not many players can do that.' </p> <p>Frivolity aside, Houllier is happy for the moment with the English players he does have, and takes delight in reeling off their ages to suggest how much better they can still become. 'Michael Owen is 21, Emile 23, and Robbie is only 25,' he said. 'Steven Gerrard is 20, and that might be the most amazing thing of all. I think he's a bit like Roy Keane. He can take the game by the scruff of the neck, and at 20 you just don't expect that. His attitude is top class, and when he is 23 or 24 he will be a player, believe me. Yet, according to the papers, Roma only want to give \u00a315 million for him. I think they must have dropped a zero somewhere. Fifteen million for Stevie Gerrard when Rio Ferdinand was sold for \u00a318 million? It doesn't matter anyway because he's not for sale. The boy's future is here. He's a Scouser.' </p> <p>So is Jamie Carragher, for whom Houllier also predicts an international future. Danny Murphy, from Chester, appeared to be drifting out of the club before Liverpool put him back on the right track. 'As soon as Danny changed his attitude, he became a different player,' Houllier said. 'He felt he wasn't in the team enough, but look at him now. He's played in all the big games.' </p> <p>The transformation that reflects most creditably on Houllier, however, is that in Heskey. As recently as last summer with England, the former Leicester striker looked an \u00a311m liability, even if Houllier insists on telling anyone who will listen that the actual fee was only \u00a310.5m. He was clumsy and ineffective, apart from when making his physical presence felt. He did not, in short, look a likely spearhead for Liverpool or for England, whereas now he does. Houllier can now be believed when he says Heskey is going to get better. 'We haven't seen 50 per cent of what Emile can do yet,' said the man who first spotted Heskey's potential in an under-18 international in 1996. 'I didn't know then that one day I would be working for Liverpool, but Emile scored a goal in a 3-2 defeat of Belgium, and I began to follow him. I had Sky at home in France, and Leicester were having some success, so I saw quite a bit of him. Then when I came to Liverpool I mentioned him because I felt we needed some strength and power up front.' </p> <p>Houllier has not been disappointed in Heskey's strength and shooting power - the literally unstoppable goal he scored against Leeds in the FA Cup has been officially rated the strongest shot of the season - but he appears to have harnessed the striker's undoubted physique to bring his goalscoring ability to the fore. </p> <p>'Emile is not like Robbie Fowler, he's not convinced of his natural ability and he's very unselfish,' Houllier explained. 'He actually has tremendous ability in the box, but didn't know it. He was playing a different game at Leicester, where he was used as a target man. All we've done is discourage him from taking up wide positions and encourage him to get forward into the box. Previously he sometimes started a move, then stood and watched, instead of getting on the end of it. But he's got quick feet and an incredible shot, just ask Sander Westerveld about his shots in training. We just told him that with the shot he has, if he gets his body on the ball correctly, he will score without knowing.' </p> <p>Heskey is not quite doing that yet, but, with 17 goals already this season, he is scoring and absorbing advice to an extent that pleases Liverpool and should ultimately benefit England. </p> <p>'Not too many other countries have a centre-forward like that,' Houllier said. 'He has strength, power and speed and his skill will increase in the next few years. He's always listening, which is important, because a player who doesn't listen doesn't progress. He will definitely improve, and he's only 23. What is the best age for a striker? How old is Gabriel Batistuta? How old was Alan Shearer at his best? Emile has his best years in front of him, and the good thing from England's point of view is that he is not alone. There's Michael and Robbie, Andy Cole, Alan Smith, Kevin Phillips and maybe others like James Beattie. </p> <p>'That's just the strikers. That is why I keep saying, in England you are lucky.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "When David Davies recently said England could win the World Cup in 2006 it sounded like the sort of boastful jingoism Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson could probably do without. You need someone like G\u00e9rard Houllier to say the same thing for anyone to sit up and take notice. The Liverpool manager has long been a fan of English football, and his knowledge of English players is superior to Eriksson's. In charge of up to half a dozen present and future internationals at Anfield, and himself a foreign coach responsible for bringing about the sort of rapid and tangible improvement that has just taken the pride of Serie A by surprise, Houllier believes the upcoming generation of English talent is the most exciting he has seen anywhere at any one time. Coming from a man who was closely involved in the winning of the last World Cup, that is quite a compliment. Eriksson may not appreciate the pressure being steadily cranked up as he prepares for his first game as England manager on Wednesday, but the former French technical director is specific about what England can expect. 'I don't think Eriksson has taken the job at quite the ideal time because it's difficult at the moment,' Houllier said. 'He's trapped in a situation where he has old players on the verge of retiring but his young players are still too inexperienced. I don't believe you can have a big swap at international level, you have to bring your young players through gradually. At the same time, Eriksson needs results, and you can't get results without experience, so he can't get rid of his old players just like that. I don't expect a lot from England in 2002, but, with the crop of young players you have, this country should be a force in 2006 and 2008. Your young players are good now and if they stay focused and fit they will become better and better.' The conditional is necessary because Houllier accepts that English football is not always straightforward, that career paths are not as easily plotted as they might be in other countries. He contends that England have around 40 'outstanding' prospects between the ages of 18 and 23 - roughly twice as many as any of the other leading footballing nations - but knows there is no guarantee there will be the same number of fully developed internationals five or six years down the line. 'The crop is outstanding, but it's down to your players now to see what they want to achieve,' Houllier said. 'It's a matter of personality and of willpower, because this is a job that gives you a lot of money and a lot of free time. But the demands of top-level football are so high now you have to live for the job. The minute you start using the job as a means to live well you are on your way down. English football is only just cottoning on to this. The French, for example, are amused by the idea of a booze ban.

      "body": "<p>Wednesday afternoon's select committee hearing on the Communications White Paper was a great disappointment. There we were, crammed shoulder to shoulder in committee room 15, expecting to see two government Ministers - Culture Minister Chris Smith and Patricia Hewitt from the DTI - subjected to the rapier-like wit and wisdom of Gerald Kaufman. It was Kaufman, remember, who once proposed that the answer to Britain's woeful inability to produce a corporate media giant was to merge BT and the BBC. Not a man for sentimental attachments to British institutions. Who would be savaged today? </p> <p>In the event, Mr Kaufman was a softie and even the BBC escaped a tongue-lashing. The other members of the committee, however, gave some interesting pointers to their final report on the White Paper which might be summarised in three words: more government intervention. It soon became clear that the commercial sector had been scoring a few direct lobbying hits, and two broad themes emerged where members were looking for action. </p> <p>First, what's the government going to do about promoting new technology? Members nodded approvingly when John Maxton declared that the internet and broadband access were 'the key to how our economy develops'. The burgeoning number of entries on my Visa bill for Amazon.com provides some support for this thesis, though I suspect it is overdone. Recent frenzied optimism about the e-economy will probably go the same way as the dotcom bubble. </p> <p>Patricia Hewitt quoted figures from the report on broadband strategy - published this week by her department - that 15-20 per cent of the population won't have broadband access by 2003. How many of the other 80 per cent will want it or be able to afford it, how to reach the remainder, and what the role of government should be, are all questions posed by that report. Answers are in short supply. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Derek Wyatt, David Faber and Gerald Kaufman wanted government to sort out the confusion in digital television. Why not provide a free digital box for every home to speed up the switch-over? Can't the Government knock some corporate heads together and mandate a common framework? How are we going to get round an apparently widespread ignorance and/or indifference among consumers and retailers? </p> <p>Again, there were few solutions. The Government might have a role to play, said Smith, but they weren't quite sure how. Preparing simple explanatory leaflets, perhaps. Or persuading broadcasters to use their own air-time. Patricia Hewitt admitted that the only reason she managed to find an integrated digital television set was because she knew exactly what to ask for, and happened upon a salesperson who understood the digital lingo (a \u00a3399 bargain at Argos, apparently. Probably obsolete by now). </p> <p>Second, more ominously, was the BBC question. Not much on the BBC in the White Paper said Alan Keen, with the barely concealed sub-text: Why is the Beeb not subjected to the same regulatory regime as its commercial competitors? Claire Ward was more explicit: didn't life become very difficult for other broadcasters when the BBC was 'not in the same ball-park'. The ball-park in question was, of course, the beady eye of the proposed new regulator Ofcom. </p> <p>Ward gave a very specific example. Radio 2 used to be the sort of station listened to by her parents (I can empathise - mine too). Then the BBC changed the format to attract a younger 25-40 listenership (here, Ms Ward and I part company. I'm an avid listener and won't be seeing 40 again). They are therefore competing directly with commercial channels and, worse, have left the over-40s uncatered for. All this without any reference to some higher authority which might have restrained such an ill-considered shift in programming strategy. </p> <p>Chris Smith could have given a number of answers to this. The BBC is a benchmark of quality for others to follow: if its stations do better, competitors should raise their game. Or, to justify a universal licence fee, the BBC has to provide services for all licence payers; it is not and must not become a ghetto broadcaster which fills market gaps. Or, the prospect of a single all-powerful regulator controlling the whole of broadcasting is not attractive in a pluralist democracy. </p> <p>What he actually said was rather more worrying, and went something like this: If it could be demonstrated that this was a substantially different service from the one in place at Charter renewal, then there would be a role for the Secretary of State to consider it [and by implication order the BBC to reverse it]. He was signalling, more explicitly than ever before, the government's response to those who would hand the BBC over to Ofcom: 'We can control any excesses from the centre'. It's a very slippery slope - and we can't even blame Gerald Kaufman. </p> <p>Steve Barnett is Professor of Communications at the University of Westminster.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There's little the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences likes to see more than one of its own directing himself in the role of an egomaniacal, preferable tortured and self-destructive, hero. That was the case with Robert Duvall three years ago in The Apostle and it's true again this year with Ed Harris's best actor nomination for his portrayal of the abstract expressionist artist Jackson Pollock. </p> <p> Pollock, which opened in America two weeks ago to largely favourable reviews, may be one of the few films about a painter to transcend the clich\u00e9s so often found in movies that try to unravel the mysteries of artistic endeavour. 'No actor is better suited than Mr Harris to portray the artist,' declared the New York Times. </p> <p>In Harris's muscular portrayal there's no room for the limp-wristed, nor for any dreamy scene where a painter receives the muse of creation. But a ruinous end? Of course. </p> <p> After a career of highs - among them playing John Glenn in The Right Stuff - and lows such as The Rock, Absolute Power and Stepmom, Pollock is Harris's labour of love, the culmination of a 10-year quest to bring the painter faithfully to the screen. 'It's this thing I've been thinking about for years,' the 50-year-old actor said recently. 'My little girl's been hearing about it since before she was even born.' </p> <p>He delivers a Pollock who experiences tremendous, agonising self doubt and despair - even when he's out buying cornflakes. </p> <p>It's surprising that no one has attempted to make a film of Pollock's life before now.

Harris managed to capture Pollock's athletic, agitated battle with the canvas by watching Hans Namuth's 1950 film of the painter in action.

Co-star Jeffrey Tambor, who plays art critic Clement Greenberg, says: 'It was a lifetime's achievement.

      "bodyText": "There's little the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences likes to see more than one of its own directing himself in the role of an egomaniacal, preferable tortured and self-destructive, hero. That was the case with Robert Duvall three years ago in The Apostle and it's true again this year with Ed Harris's best actor nomination for his portrayal of the abstract expressionist artist Jackson Pollock. Pollock, which opened in America two weeks ago to largely favourable reviews, may be one of the few films about a painter to transcend the clich\u00e9s so often found in movies that try to unravel the mysteries of artistic endeavour. 'No actor is better suited than Mr Harris to portray the artist,' declared the New York Times. In Harris's muscular portrayal there's no room for the limp-wristed, nor for any dreamy scene where a painter receives the muse of creation. But a ruinous end? Of course. After a career of highs - among them playing John Glenn in The Right Stuff - and lows such as The Rock, Absolute Power and Stepmom, Pollock is Harris's labour of love, the culmination of a 10-year quest to bring the painter faithfully to the screen. 'It's this thing I've been thinking about for years,' the 50-year-old actor said recently. 'My little girl's been hearing about it since before she was even born.' He delivers a Pollock who experiences tremendous, agonising self doubt and despair - even when he's out buying cornflakes. It's surprising that no one has attempted to make a film of Pollock's life before now. He was, after all, the American painter whose search for unmediated self-expression ended up changing the course of modern art and wrestling the crown from the Europeans. And beyond his penchant for flinging, dripping or pouring paint on gigantic canvases, his life was full of the psycho-theatrics that actors adore - anger, alcoholism, twisted love, abuse and violent death. Pollock died aged just 44 in a car crash on Long Island in 1956 with a mistress half his age. For Harris to play Pollock required total immersion of the kind method actors love.

      "body": "<p>Secret talks have been held at the highest levels of the Tory party to carry out the biggest restructuring of the National Health Service since its creation, with all people earning more than \u00a335,000 banned from treatment. </p> <p>Hoping to spark a debate about NHS funding, William Hague's top health adviser last night indicated the party believed in large-scale privatisation of the health service as well as means-testing for patients. </p> <p>In an interview with The Observer , which immediately provoked accusations that the Tories had a secret plan to 'privatise the NHS', Dr Michael Goldsmith said that it was time for radical thinking about how the country treats millions of patients every year. </p> <p>Goldsmith said there should be a complete overhaul of health provision, described modernisation of the NHS as following the 'railway' model and said that it could eventually be left as a provider of 'core services' rather than offering universal care as at present. </p> <p>Goldsmith, who said his views were 'personal', said that without the change the NHS would not give the public the service they deserved. </p> <p>A number of senior Tories are said privately to agree with him, although one admitted that it would be 'political dynamite' to admit it publicly. Hague has ordered a clampdown on talk of privatisation by MPs, fearing it will be electorally damaging. </p> <p>The Labour Party said Goldsmith's ideas revealed a Tory agenda for a two-tier NHS. </p> <p>'On the weekend that the Conservatives are supposedly drafting their manifesto, we see now the detail of their plans,' said Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary. 'This is not a slip of the tongue, it is the authentic voice of today's Conservative Party on health. They are more extreme than even Mrs Thatcher, and everyone knows what damage she did to the National Health Service.' </p> <p>Goldsmith said that the only way to increase health spending to the level of continental Europe would be to increase taxes enormously, which people did not want, or to allow the private sector to treat more patients. </p> <p>'In Britain we spend less in the private sector than anywhere else in Europe,' he said. 'If we can encourage private spending, [then] that is adding to the total pot of expenditure on health and, if you add to the total expenditure on health, then the health of the nation will improve.' </p> <p>Goldsmith, who heads the Conservative Medical Society, praised 'the German system', where he said that people earning more than \u00a335,000 had to rely on private insurance for their health care. </p> <p>'We may get into a system where it [healthcare] is means-tested - like in Germany where, if you earn more than \u00a335,000 a year, you can't have national health service treatment. It isn't for you, you have to have private insur ance. It works really well on the Continent. </p> <p>'The NHS is for people earning up to a certain amount and after that they've got to insure privately, because the NHS won't cover them.' </p> <p>Goldsmith is one of the most influential health experts in the country. He was adviser to the last Conservative government, and was praised by David Willetts, the Shadow Social Security Secretary, for being behind the GP fundholding reforms which made doctors battle in a market for resources. </p> <p>He now advises Dr Liam Fox, the Shadow Health Secretary, and is behind Fox's plans to increase the number of people with private health insurance. </p> <p>'A proportion of what you spend on health care will come from the Government and that's [for] your basic core and the rest is down to you,' Goldsmith said. </p> <p>'The NHS will be responsible for policing [and] standard setting as they [the Government] are now with the privatisation of railways. I use the word privatisation carefully. I'm not suggesting privatisation of the NHS - the NHS has got to stay - but you might have privatisation of provision, I think that's quite possible. That's a model that's workable.' </p> <p>Goldsmith's arguments will convince critics that the Conservatives want to move large amounts of the health service to the private sector, believing it can do a better job than the 'bureaucratic' NHS. </p> <p>In a speech last week, Fox said that 'it is not a capital crime to admit that the NHS desperately needs far-reaching reform. On the contrary, until that reform is undertaken, the health of the British people will continue to suffer.'</p>",

Hoping to spark a debate about NHS funding, William Hague's top health adviser last night indicated the party believed in large-scale privatisation of the health service as well as means-testing for patients. In an interview with The Observer , which immediately provoked accusations that the Tories had a secret plan to 'privatise the NHS', Dr Michael Goldsmith said that it was time for radical thinking about how the country treats millions of patients every year. Goldsmith said there should be a complete overhaul of health provision, described modernisation of the NHS as following the 'railway' model and said that it could eventually be left as a provider of 'core services' rather than offering universal care as at present. Goldsmith, who said his views were 'personal', said that without the change the NHS would not give the public the service they deserved. A number of senior Tories are said privately to agree with him, although one admitted that it would be 'political dynamite' to admit it publicly. Hague has ordered a clampdown on talk of privatisation by MPs, fearing it will be electorally damaging. The Labour Party said Goldsmith's ideas revealed a Tory agenda for a two-tier NHS. 'On the weekend that the Conservatives are supposedly drafting their manifesto, we see now the detail of their plans,' said Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary. 'This is not a slip of the tongue, it is the authentic voice of today's Conservative Party on health. They are more extreme than even Mrs Thatcher, and everyone knows what damage she did to the National Health Service.' Goldsmith said that the only way to increase health spending to the level of continental Europe would be to increase taxes enormously, which people did not want, or to allow the private sector to treat more patients. 'In Britain we spend less in the private sector than anywhere else in Europe,' he said. 'If we can encourage private spending, [then] that is adding to the total pot of expenditure on health and, if you add to the total expenditure on health, then the health of the nation will improve.' Goldsmith, who heads the Conservative Medical Society, praised 'the German system', where he said that people earning more than \u00a335,000 had to rely on private insurance for their health care. 'We may get into a system where it [healthcare] is means-tested - like in Germany where, if you earn more than \u00a335,000 a year, you can't have national health service treatment. It isn't for you, you have to have private insur ance. It works really well on the Continent. 'The NHS is for people earning up to a certain amount and after that they've got to insure privately, because the NHS won't cover them.' Goldsmith is one of the most influential health experts in the country. He was adviser to the last Conservative government, and was praised by David Willetts, the Shadow Social Security Secretary, for being behind the GP fundholding reforms which made doctors battle in a market for resources. He now advises Dr Liam Fox, the Shadow Health Secretary, and is behind Fox's plans to increase the number of people with private health insurance. 'A proportion of what you spend on health care will come from the Government and that's [for] your basic core and the rest is down to you,' Goldsmith said. 'The NHS will be responsible for policing [and] standard setting as they [the Government] are now with the privatisation of railways. I use the word privatisation carefully. I'm not suggesting privatisation of the NHS - the NHS has got to stay - but you might have privatisation of provision, I think that's quite possible. That's a model that's workable.' Goldsmith's arguments will convince critics that the Conservatives want to move large amounts of the health service to the private sector, believing it can do a better job than the 'bureaucratic' NHS. In a speech last week, Fox said that 'it is not a capital crime to admit that the NHS desperately needs far-reaching reform. On the contrary, until that reform is undertaken, the health of the British people will continue to suffer.'",

      "body": "<p>'When it's two o'clock in the morning, and you're manic, even the UCLA Medical center has a certain appeal. The hospital - ordinarily a cold clotting of uninteresting buildings - became for me, that fall morning not quite 20 years ago, a focus of my finely wired, exquisitely alert nervous system. With vibrissae twinging, antennae perked, eyes fast-forwarding and fly faceted, I took in everything around me. I was on the run. Not just on the run but fast and furious on the run, darting back and forth across the hospital parking lot trying to use up a boundless, restless, manic energy. I was running fast, but slowly going mad.' </p> <p>Thus Kay Jamison, psychologist and manic depressive, described a psychotic episode in her brilliant book, An Unquiet Mind, subtitled 'A Memoir of Moods and Madness'. Combining the expertise of the professional with the insight of a patient, she confronted a disease that defies prediction and ruins lives. In the course of it, she told us more about mental illness than 20 articles in the British Journal of Psychiatry . 'Manic depression,' she wrote, 'is a disease that both kills and gives life. Fire, by its nature, both creates and destroys... mania is a strange and driving force, a destroyer, a fire in the blood.' </p> <p>You will not find language like this in the 10,000 words of earnest rhetoric that constitute the Government's new White Paper on Reforming the Mental Health Act in England and Wales. Nor indeed will you find any reference to 'madness'. It is the forbidden subject, a black hole around which we circle fearfully, ring-fencing it with decent phrases like mental illness, mental disorder, mental disability, mental incapacity, anything, in short, that saves us from the difficulty, the embarrassment or the pain of exploring the mind of someone who is losing theirs. </p> <p>Instead, the watchword is 'protection'. There has, say Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, and Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, been a tragic toll of homicides and suicides. The current laws have failed properly to protect the public; the lives of patients and staff have been put at risk. We must protect the mentally ill from themselves, and from the public; we must protect the public from the mentally ill. In Scotland, an even weightier document has been published - 500 pages reporting on a detailed review of the Mental Health Act as it applies to Scotland. No one can doubt that it is well-intentioned. Its stated principles include non-discrimination, equality and respect. It places patients, or as they are referred to these days, 'service users', at the centre of its proposals. It explores the need to change the way mental patients are compulsorily treated, and for the first time acknowledges the role of relatives and friends, the embattled front line of those who cope every day with the mentally ill. </p> <p>It will, however, take more than good intentions to reverse the 30 years of failure and neglect that have characterised this country's treatment of its mental patients, the scandal of its prematurely shut-down hospitals and its underfunded programme of care in the community. It will take courage to spend time in those wards, where the cigarette ends litter the floor and the smears of angry protest stain the walls; courage to talk to the damaged souls who inhabit them, and the wary staff whose job it is to monitor their restless progress. And courage to confront the reality that awaits the inmates when the drugs have run their course, and they are judged well enough to return to the unwelcoming world outside. </p> <p>The reality then is likely to be the schizophrenic boy who sits in his lonely flat, watching the TV which speaks to him in strange voices, or the anorexic girl who claws at her wrists as she waits for the hospital bed that is no longer available, or the family in despair as they see their manic-depressive son spiralling out of control, unable to take action until he commits a crime and the police move in. </p> <p>Kay Jamison's book ends with her finding the correct level of lithium to hold her life on course, recognising that she would always swing between the 'electrifying carnival of light' that marked her manic phases and the 'black, grey and tired heap' into which she plummeted when they came to an end. But Professor Jamison had privileges which most of today's mental patients in Britain conspicuously lack. She benefited from her own intelligence and insight; she had the expert care of well-qualified friends and fellow-professionals; her illness, though threatening, did not cripple her. Life on the NHS is very different. </p> <p>We spent much of last Christmas in the closed ward of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital where our son was consigned following the onset of a manic episode. He had been involved in a fracas with a pub bouncer who had called the police. Archie has never been violent, but he is tall and can be intimidating, so from time to time he has attracted the defensive aggression of others. </p> <p>He has suffered from manic depression, or bipolar affective disorder as it is medically termed, for more than 15 years, after succumbing to it first while he was still at school. MD is a relentless and unforgiving disease. It comes in cycles, but they are unpredictable. The manic phase means that all the processes of brain and body speed up to the point where life becomes like a Ferris wheel at speed, out of control, wildly exhilarating. Most normal constraints fall away, behaviour becomes loud and boisterous (the medical jargon calls it 'inappropriate'), money is spent like water, sleep is an optional extra. It is followed by a period of dark depression, when any action at all seems almost impossible. </p> <p>To anyone who has not experienced them, the first signs of manic depression can be frightening. Archie was 15 years old, in mid-school career, when it happened. He had always been a gregarious schoolboy, popular, outgoing, a brilliant actor who had starred in several school plays. One half-term, while preparing a written project, his work began to slow down and finally stop, to the point where he was physically incapable of pushing his pen across the paper. Unable to explain or communicate what was happening, he found himself in a mental limbo, while we looked on, incapable of helping. We took him to a psychiatrist who advised the school, and he prescribed anti-depressants. It seemed, on the surface, to be some kind of nervous breakdown, and by the following term Archie had recovered sufficiently to return. But he found himself unable to cope with school routine and finally it was decided he should come back home. </p> <p>What happened next was far worse. The depression he had been going through was succeeded by a period of intense, disturbing activity. His behaviour became loudly extravagant, his language crude and offensive. He would play music in his room at top volume. Then one night he disappeared. We lived in London at the time, and all we could do was alert the police and tell them about his state of mind. </p> <p>They found him next day at King's Cross station. He was angry and obstreperous, furious at being held in a police cell, insistent that he should be released. </p> <p>We called in the same psychiatrist, who said there was only one solution - Archie should be taken to a hospital in south London dealing with psychotic illnesses. I will never forget that drive. He had no idea where he was being taken and we had to conceal the reality from him. We felt helpless, as if, in the act of defending him, we were in fact committing an act of treachery. When we rounded the corner of the hospital drive and he saw where we were taking him he was outraged. He was dragged inside, literally kicking and screaming, though to the end he preserved his sense of humour. 'Where's the press?' he shouted. 'They should be here to see this.' </p> <p>This was our first experience of a closed ward, a place constructed to prevent its inmates doing harm to themselves or others. It was the first of many. Since that day, Archie has run the gamut of hospitals, from the privately-financed Priory hospitals to state-run institutions, north and south of the border. Both he and we have learnt much about the illness, the agony of confronting a person who rejects help contemptuously but needs it desperately, the despair when he is out of control, roaring down the street towards who knows what fate. </p> <p>We have known the phone calls, from him or the police, to tell of some escapade, the requests to come and collect him or to visit him in a cell or a hospital ward. And we have known the joy and relief when gradually, as it always does, the wheel returns him to something approaching normality. Through this time, we have seen every form of treatment, from ECT to cocktails of drugs, delivered in doses so powerful you cannot imagine he could survive them, yet absorbed into his system as if they were aspirin. It is a tribute to him and the strength of his character that he has emerged from this history of medical battering with his warmth, charm and independence intact. We are immensely proud of him. </p> <p>Two things have marked his long and, thus far, unfinished journey: the handful of doctors and nurses who stood by him through the worst of times, and whose dedication in awful circumstances is humbling. And the steady decline of the health service which should have supported him. His period of illness coincides with one of the most wretched chapters in the postwar history of the NHS. It has seen the closing down of some of Britain's largest mental hospitals - the asylums, or places of safety, of a previous era - and the heavy reduction of available beds. In their place was substituted care in the community. </p> <p>The idea was that the resources tied up in the buildings and their beds would be released to provide a support service for the mentally ill once they were returned to their families and their localities. But the funds were diverted elsewhere, and the back-up was wholly inadequate. Patients, many of them still on heavy medication, were discharged by hospitals which had no means of monitoring their progress. Families incapable of handling difficult and disruptive relatives were left to cope on their own. GPs found their lists swollen by cases requiring specialist advice which was overstretched and often unavailable. Meanwhile, as medication grew more sophisticated, the need for long-term psychiatric care was judged to be less important or even unnecessary. Investment in psychotherapy declined, the means of ensuring long-term support for patients once released into the community became stretched or non-existent. </p> <p>Addressing the annual meeting of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Belfast in 1998, the distinguished psychiatrist, Professor Hugh Freeman, concluded thus: 'I will say very little about the developments of the 1990s, except that I regard them as almost wholly disastrous.' </p> <p>In his lecture, he traced the history of mental health services in this country from the Victorian era, when those forbidding asylums which we now reject so contemptuously were built as places of safety. Looking back at that period, what is striking is the recognition by philanthropists that the mentally ill had been scandalously treated in the past, and that what they needed most was something to occupy their minds and bodies. Thus many of the hospitals built at the time had extensive gardens and the opportunity to learn a trade. Opening a new wing of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital in 1894, costing \u00a3160,000, an immense sum for those days, a Scots benefactor, Sir Thomas Clouston, said: 'Nothing we can do for the comfort of our patients is too much to atone for the cruelty of past ages.' </p> <p>It is hard to determine exactly when the subsequent decline began. Some would say there has always been a reluctance to allow psychiatry to operate under the same terms and conditions as other branches of medicine, and, of course, many of those old hospitals did become grim places as their physical condition deteriorated. Others say the erosion has been more recent, pointing out that Britain's standards of treatment were once the envy of the world, thanks to an influx of refugee specialists from Europe between the wars. </p> <p>Around the mid-1950s, with the development of more sophisticated drugs, the emphasis on hospital treatment was gradually replaced by a belief that the walls of the old institutions should be pulled down and the inmates released into the outside world. The famous 1959 Mental Health Act did not, as Professor Freeman points out, legislate for community care, but it did remove legal barriers to extramural treatment, and expressed general approval for a non-institutional approach. 'Owing to the opposition of the Treasury, however,' he says, 'local authorities were not given a positive duty to provide community mental health services and they did not receive a specific grant to do so.' </p> <p>It is a pattern that has been woefully repeated ever since. Even today, when the inadequacies of care in the community have been starkly exposed, the resources are still not there. Although grants to local authorities for community mental health care have finally been achieved, their role in the meantime has changed. They have become commissioning agents rather than providers of service. 'In the 1990s,' said Freeman, 'long-term care within the NHS virtually ceased, being largely transferred to private facilities, with social services handling the financial aspects. Yet there was virtually no public discussion of such a major change.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, spending on mental health services within the NHS actually fell in real terms by 5.4 per cent in the first half of the decade, despite being an acknowledged 'priority'. One fellow-psychiatrist described it as 'one of the best-kept secrets in the country'. </p> <p>Yet this is not a minority issue. The best estimate from the Office for National Statistics is that one in seven adults is affected at any one time by significant mental health problems. These can range from anxiety and depression to dementia and schizophrenia. Around 230 people out of 1,000 will visit their GP at some stage, of whom 102 will be diagnosed as suffering from some form of mental illness. Of these, 24 will be referred to a specialist psychiatric service and six will become in-patients in psychiatric hospitals. Not only are the figures growing, but the World Health Organisation has warned that deaths from mental health disorders will be the second most common cause of death and disability by 2020. </p> <p>I thought long and hard before writing about my son's experience in the Times following our visit last Christmas. We owe a huge debt to his doctor and his nursing staff at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, who have been involved with him for more than a decade, and who have always provided the best possible treatment in the form of medication and advice. That he has not benefited from long-term care is by no means their fault; he himself has usually rejected anything in the form of therapy, though he is visited by a community psychiatric nurse who administers a monthly injection. </p> <p>Above all, I did not want to prejudice my son's position or his future welfare. But I felt, as any parent would, a surge of anger at what I saw. Why should any patient, mental or otherwise, have to suffer these kinds of surroundings? Temporary they may be, but for a patient in the grip of a severe illness, that is small comfort. Moreover, the timing for such an article seemed to be important: both health departments north and south of the border were issuing lengthy reports on reforming the Mental Health Act of 1984. My article appeared just after Christmas. What I had not anticipated was the huge and passionate response from readers. They told stories of isolation and abandonment, of a failure to find help when it was needed most, of indifference, neglect and insensitivity. </p> <p>Watching the onset of the process that Kay Jamison calls 'running fast but slowly going mad' is agonising. Not for the sufferer, but for the onlooker. It is like seeing a car heading for certain collision. You know it is going to end in disaster but you cannot intervene. It begins with behaviour which is merely excitable - fast talking, loud conversation, impatience with the slow and boring pace of the rest of humanity. Grandiose plans must be made, meetings set up, rendezvous made and broken. As the attention span diminishes, so boredom must be banished. Routine medication becomes a tiresome interference with life lived on the edge. Tolerance disappears, to be replaced with irritation. Everyone must be sucked into a whirlpool of activity. </p> <p>It is at this stage that parents or relatives long to take action. If only they could persuade their son or daughter to check into hospital, something might be done. But this is the last thing on the mind of the manic depressive. The 'insight' that he may have acquired into his illness recedes. At the most, this 'florid' behaviour, as it is known, is dismissed as a 'blip'. The last thing he wants to contemplate is the empty routine of life on the ward. Doctors have no powers to intervene. You can alert the hospital and tip off the police, but if the patient is over 21, his or her rights are enshrined and protected. </p> <p>Almost inevitably, behaviour like this, late at night in a pub or on the street, attracts attention and leads to trouble. It can be challenging, aggressive, 'in your face'. At some stage, it may tumble over the edge, to the point where the police become involved. Oddly, the midnight call from the station sergeant comes as a relief. In almost all our dealings with the police, we have found them sensitive, understanding and co-operative. They will alert the hospital and deliver the patient into safe hands. In order to hold him, however, an application has to be made for him to be 'sectioned' under the Mental Health Act. </p> <p>The Act, framed in 1983, was drawn up largely to protect the civil rights of the mentally ill. Its powers of compulsion are, of course, highly controversial because it means the removal of someone's personal freedom. The very term 'to section' sounds vaguely sinister, almost as if it involves a surgical operation. In fact, it is a reference to the section of the Act which lays down precisely the terms under which the patient can be detained in hospital, and the carefully enshrined grounds for appeal which can be put to a court if he wishes to contest it. It is a lawyer's Act, not a psychiatrist's. Sectioning, which can remain in force for up to six months, has been attacked as a heavy-handed and intrusive instrument. But to the families who have to deal with the reality of mental illness, it is very often a lifeline. It represents the means by which, at last, the hospital is given powers to detain and the treatment can begin. </p> <p>The period that follows for patients suffering from bipolar disorders or other psychotic illnesses is likely to be lengthy, traumatic and hugely demanding. Medication, however effective, takes time to work. To begin with, you are dealing with a patient who is angry and bitterly resentful, who sees his surroundings as punishment, his hospital ward as a prison, and nursing staff as unreasonable warders. The target for his rage is likely to be the next visitor or the next doctor. Parents and relatives find themselves on the receiving end of these outbursts for they, after all, are the betrayers - they have connived with the authorities. The patient can see no reason for his continued incarceration. Everything seems to be conspiring against his release. </p> <p>The key to managing his condition at this stage is the proper combination, or 'cocktail', of anti-psychotic drugs, but sometimes even they may be ineffective, and ECT can be the only solution. That, too, has sinister overtones but, in extremis , it can be a lifesaver. As, too, is that most common of drugs, the cigarette. In the wards of mental hospitals, smoking is omnipresent and no one protests. Without tobacco, it would be hard to imagine some of those inmates, at the end of their tether, surviving at all. What they need, and all too often lack, is visitors, links with the outside world, a path they can recognise back to normality. </p> <p>One American psychiatrist working in Britain, with whom I have corresponded at length, points to the stark contrast between conditions here and in the US: 'I say this without intent to boast, but most NHS wards would be shut down in the US. The Justice Department has taken a particularly tough position with respect to hospitals which have detained patients and offer little active treatment and shoddy wards. By contrast there are a number of fine new units around the country. The acute service at Farnborough Hospital comes to mind. I believe over 400, possibly 450, consultant posts in psychiatry go unfilled. NHS consultants are stretched beyond tolerance and as a result often know their patients very little, making infrequent contacts, perhaps weekly for a few minutes. 'Care' is left to junior doctors, also stretched. Care in the community is not adequately available by any stretch of the imagination. Unconscionable compromises are made in discharging patients to the community. In London especially, aftercare is more a concept than a reality. </p> <p>Responses like this emphasise two recurring complaints: poor ward conditions where they are needed most and the low priority placed on long-term care, which must include families and friends, who are almost always the front line in dealing with mental illness. Both issues have at least been recognised in the two reports already referred to. Susan Deacon, the Scottish Health Minister, is on record as saying: 'Nowhere are more modern dignified surroundings more important in the NHS than where patients with mental health problems are concerned. Sadly, thanks to years of neglect, too many of our mental health facilities are simply not up to the job.' At Westminster, the Health Secretary, Alan Milburn, says: 'As far as hospital beds are concerned, it doesn't seem viable to go on reducing them in the way that has been happening in the last few decades.' </p> <p>At the same time, both reports recognise belatedly the role of outside carers and the need to build better contacts with them. Many GPs who deal with the mentally ill now use the services of counsellors, and there has been an expansion in what is known as 'assertive outreach teams', whose aim is to close the gap between hospital and the community, to provide the support and treatment that is needed long after the patient has been discharged. </p> <p>It has finally been recognised that the 'revolving door' scenario, whereby patients have to be regularly readmitted to hospital because they have gradually deteriorated once outside, is not only heartless, it is grossly inefficient and expensive. One can only hope that those who serve, either as counsellors or on outreach teams, are given proper training and the funding and back-up that has been so conspicuously lacking hitherto. There is still, however, a shortfall in the number of psychiatric consultants, and until this branch of medicine is properly recognised and rewarded, it is hard to see how that can be reversed. </p> <p>What is depressing is that the current discussions, both north and south of the border, place far more emphasis on the issue of 'compulsion' - the use of legal powers to commit patients to hospital against their will - than to the underlying causes that lead to a crisis in the first place. A handful of cases in which mentally ill people have attacked and sometimes murdered members of the public has dominated headlines and the minds of Ministers to the point where this is seen as the most urgent problem to be addressed. Not only are the statistics negligible,but the solution is far more complex and expensive than the easy option of simply locking up more patients. </p> <p>One can read page after page of well-intentioned prose in both the Scottish and the English reports without encountering that flash of compassion and commitment which goes beyond the precise requirements of the law and announces forthrightly: 'What we see here is a scandal. It has been hidden for too long. We are determined to end it.' </p> <p>Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of Sane, the mental health charity, talks of the need to replace 'the lost concept of asylum' and ensure that the beds, the supported places and the skilled staff are there to provide the rigorous risk assessment and care needed. 'The Government,' she says, 'must look beyond the law and guarantee the funding to provide the \"safe, sound and supportive\" system it promised.' </p> <p>There is a terrible familiarity about those sentiments. It is now 15 years since the Times devoted the whole of its leader column to a memorable indictment of Britain's mental health service. Its final paragraph ran: 'It ought not to be beyond the capabilities of British society to recognise the different needs of those who need to make only the one return trip through the revolving door, those who make many return trips, and those for whom the journey is one way for ever. Without such a determined recognition, today's tragedy of mental illness will become tomorrow's public scandal.' </p> <p>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that 'tomorrow' has arrived. The remedy, if it is out there, will only come if we are determined enough to confront the reality of mental suffering, to deal with it head-on rather than treat it as an unpleasant inconvenience from which society has to be insulated. </p> <p>That there has been a recognition of the failure of past decades has, it seems, been accepted. The words, the good intentions, the worthy investigation of systems and procedures, have been delivered. The time has come for action to redress the shameful legacy of past neglect. Britain cannot claim to be a civilised society so long as it turns its back on those who are going slowly mad. </p> <p> For those in need of immediate help or advice on mental illness, call the SANELINE on 0845 767 8000, open 12 noon to 2am </p> <p> Magnus Linklater has been chairman of the Scottish Arts Council since 1996.

      "bodyText": "'When it's two o'clock in the morning, and you're manic, even the UCLA Medical center has a certain appeal. The hospital - ordinarily a cold clotting of uninteresting buildings - became for me, that fall morning not quite 20 years ago, a focus of my finely wired, exquisitely alert nervous system. With vibrissae twinging, antennae perked, eyes fast-forwarding and fly faceted, I took in everything around me. I was on the run. Not just on the run but fast and furious on the run, darting back and forth across the hospital parking lot trying to use up a boundless, restless, manic energy. I was running fast, but slowly going mad.' Thus Kay Jamison, psychologist and manic depressive, described a psychotic episode in her brilliant book, An Unquiet Mind, subtitled 'A Memoir of Moods and Madness'. Combining the expertise of the professional with the insight of a patient, she confronted a disease that defies prediction and ruins lives. In the course of it, she told us more about mental illness than 20 articles in the British Journal of Psychiatry . 'Manic depression,' she wrote, 'is a disease that both kills and gives life. Fire, by its nature, both creates and destroys... mania is a strange and driving force, a destroyer, a fire in the blood.' You will not find language like this in the 10,000 words of earnest rhetoric that constitute the Government's new White Paper on Reforming the Mental Health Act in England and Wales. Nor indeed will you find any reference to 'madness'. It is the forbidden subject, a black hole around which we circle fearfully, ring-fencing it with decent phrases like mental illness, mental disorder, mental disability, mental incapacity, anything, in short, that saves us from the difficulty, the embarrassment or the pain of exploring the mind of someone who is losing theirs. Instead, the watchword is 'protection'. There has, say Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, and Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, been a tragic toll of homicides and suicides. The current laws have failed properly to protect the public; the lives of patients and staff have been put at risk. We must protect the mentally ill from themselves, and from the public; we must protect the public from the mentally ill. In Scotland, an even weightier document has been published - 500 pages reporting on a detailed review of the Mental Health Act as it applies to Scotland. No one can doubt that it is well-intentioned. Its stated principles include non-discrimination, equality and respect. It places patients, or as they are referred to these days, 'service users', at the centre of its proposals. It explores the need to change the way mental patients are compulsorily treated, and for the first time acknowledges the role of relatives and friends, the embattled front line of those who cope every day with the mentally ill. It will, however, take more than good intentions to reverse the 30 years of failure and neglect that have characterised this country's treatment of its mental patients, the scandal of its prematurely shut-down hospitals and its underfunded programme of care in the community. It will take courage to spend time in those wards, where the cigarette ends litter the floor and the smears of angry protest stain the walls; courage to talk to the damaged souls who inhabit them, and the wary staff whose job it is to monitor their restless progress. And courage to confront the reality that awaits the inmates when the drugs have run their course, and they are judged well enough to return to the unwelcoming world outside. The reality then is likely to be the schizophrenic boy who sits in his lonely flat, watching the TV which speaks to him in strange voices, or the anorexic girl who claws at her wrists as she waits for the hospital bed that is no longer available, or the family in despair as they see their manic-depressive son spiralling out of control, unable to take action until he commits a crime and the police move in. Kay Jamison's book ends with her finding the correct level of lithium to hold her life on course, recognising that she would always swing between the 'electrifying carnival of light' that marked her manic phases and the 'black, grey and tired heap' into which she plummeted when they came to an end. But Professor Jamison had privileges which most of today's mental patients in Britain conspicuously lack. She benefited from her own intelligence and insight; she had the expert care of well-qualified friends and fellow-professionals; her illness, though threatening, did not cripple her. Life on the NHS is very different. We spent much of last Christmas in the closed ward of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital where our son was consigned following the onset of a manic episode. He had been involved in a fracas with a pub bouncer who had called the police. Archie has never been violent, but he is tall and can be intimidating, so from time to time he has attracted the defensive aggression of others. He has suffered from manic depression, or bipolar affective disorder as it is medically termed, for more than 15 years, after succumbing to it first while he was still at school. MD is a relentless and unforgiving disease. It comes in cycles, but they are unpredictable. The manic phase means that all the processes of brain and body speed up to the point where life becomes like a Ferris wheel at speed, out of control, wildly exhilarating. Most normal constraints fall away, behaviour becomes loud and boisterous (the medical jargon calls it 'inappropriate'), money is spent like water, sleep is an optional extra. It is followed by a period of dark depression, when any action at all seems almost impossible. To anyone who has not experienced them, the first signs of manic depression can be frightening. Archie was 15 years old, in mid-school career, when it happened. He had always been a gregarious schoolboy, popular, outgoing, a brilliant actor who had starred in several school plays. One half-term, while preparing a written project, his work began to slow down and finally stop, to the point where he was physically incapable of pushing his pen across the paper. Unable to explain or communicate what was happening, he found himself in a mental limbo, while we looked on, incapable of helping. We took him to a psychiatrist who advised the school, and he prescribed anti-depressants. It seemed, on the surface, to be some kind of nervous breakdown, and by the following term Archie had recovered sufficiently to return. But he found himself unable to cope with school routine and finally it was decided he should come back home. What happened next was far worse. The depression he had been going through was succeeded by a period of intense, disturbing activity. His behaviour became loudly extravagant, his language crude and offensive. He would play music in his room at top volume. Then one night he disappeared. We lived in London at the time, and all we could do was alert the police and tell them about his state of mind. They found him next day at King's Cross station. He was angry and obstreperous, furious at being held in a police cell, insistent that he should be released. We called in the same psychiatrist, who said there was only one solution - Archie should be taken to a hospital in south London dealing with psychotic illnesses. I will never forget that drive. He had no idea where he was being taken and we had to conceal the reality from him. We felt helpless, as if, in the act of defending him, we were in fact committing an act of treachery. When we rounded the corner of the hospital drive and he saw where we were taking him he was outraged. He was dragged inside, literally kicking and screaming, though to the end he preserved his sense of humour. 'Where's the press?' he shouted. 'They should be here to see this.' This was our first experience of a closed ward, a place constructed to prevent its inmates doing harm to themselves or others. It was the first of many. Since that day, Archie has run the gamut of hospitals, from the privately-financed Priory hospitals to state-run institutions, north and south of the border. Both he and we have learnt much about the illness, the agony of confronting a person who rejects help contemptuously but needs it desperately, the despair when he is out of control, roaring down the street towards who knows what fate. We have known the phone calls, from him or the police, to tell of some escapade, the requests to come and collect him or to visit him in a cell or a hospital ward. And we have known the joy and relief when gradually, as it always does, the wheel returns him to something approaching normality. Through this time, we have seen every form of treatment, from ECT to cocktails of drugs, delivered in doses so powerful you cannot imagine he could survive them, yet absorbed into his system as if they were aspirin. It is a tribute to him and the strength of his character that he has emerged from this history of medical battering with his warmth, charm and independence intact. We are immensely proud of him. Two things have marked his long and, thus far, unfinished journey: the handful of doctors and nurses who stood by him through the worst of times, and whose dedication in awful circumstances is humbling. And the steady decline of the health service which should have supported him. His period of illness coincides with one of the most wretched chapters in the postwar history of the NHS. It has seen the closing down of some of Britain's largest mental hospitals - the asylums, or places of safety, of a previous era - and the heavy reduction of available beds. In their place was substituted care in the community. The idea was that the resources tied up in the buildings and their beds would be released to provide a support service for the mentally ill once they were returned to their families and their localities. But the funds were diverted elsewhere, and the back-up was wholly inadequate. Patients, many of them still on heavy medication, were discharged by hospitals which had no means of monitoring their progress. Families incapable of handling difficult and disruptive relatives were left to cope on their own. GPs found their lists swollen by cases requiring specialist advice which was overstretched and often unavailable. Meanwhile, as medication grew more sophisticated, the need for long-term psychiatric care was judged to be less important or even unnecessary. Investment in psychotherapy declined, the means of ensuring long-term support for patients once released into the community became stretched or non-existent. Addressing the annual meeting of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Belfast in 1998, the distinguished psychiatrist, Professor Hugh Freeman, concluded thus: 'I will say very little about the developments of the 1990s, except that I regard them as almost wholly disastrous.' In his lecture, he traced the history of mental health services in this country from the Victorian era, when those forbidding asylums which we now reject so contemptuously were built as places of safety. Looking back at that period, what is striking is the recognition by philanthropists that the mentally ill had been scandalously treated in the past, and that what they needed most was something to occupy their minds and bodies. Thus many of the hospitals built at the time had extensive gardens and the opportunity to learn a trade. Opening a new wing of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital in 1894, costing \u00a3160,000, an immense sum for those days, a Scots benefactor, Sir Thomas Clouston, said: 'Nothing we can do for the comfort of our patients is too much to atone for the cruelty of past ages.' It is hard to determine exactly when the subsequent decline began. Some would say there has always been a reluctance to allow psychiatry to operate under the same terms and conditions as other branches of medicine, and, of course, many of those old hospitals did become grim places as their physical condition deteriorated. Others say the erosion has been more recent, pointing out that Britain's standards of treatment were once the envy of the world, thanks to an influx of refugee specialists from Europe between the wars. Around the mid-1950s, with the development of more sophisticated drugs, the emphasis on hospital treatment was gradually replaced by a belief that the walls of the old institutions should be pulled down and the inmates released into the outside world. The famous 1959 Mental Health Act did not, as Professor Freeman points out, legislate for community care, but it did remove legal barriers to extramural treatment, and expressed general approval for a non-institutional approach. 'Owing to the opposition of the Treasury, however,' he says, 'local authorities were not given a positive duty to provide community mental health services and they did not receive a specific grant to do so.' It is a pattern that has been woefully repeated ever since. Even today, when the inadequacies of care in the community have been starkly exposed, the resources are still not there. Although grants to local authorities for community mental health care have finally been achieved, their role in the meantime has changed. They have become commissioning agents rather than providers of service. 'In the 1990s,' said Freeman, 'long-term care within the NHS virtually ceased, being largely transferred to private facilities, with social services handling the financial aspects. Yet there was virtually no public discussion of such a major change.' Meanwhile, spending on mental health services within the NHS actually fell in real terms by 5.4 per cent in the first half of the decade, despite being an acknowledged 'priority'. One fellow-psychiatrist described it as 'one of the best-kept secrets in the country'. Yet this is not a minority issue. The best estimate from the Office for National Statistics is that one in seven adults is affected at any one time by significant mental health problems. These can range from anxiety and depression to dementia and schizophrenia. Around 230 people out of 1,000 will visit their GP at some stage, of whom 102 will be diagnosed as suffering from some form of mental illness. Of these, 24 will be referred to a specialist psychiatric service and six will become in-patients in psychiatric hospitals. Not only are the figures growing, but the World Health Organisation has warned that deaths from mental health disorders will be the second most common cause of death and disability by 2020. I thought long and hard before writing about my son's experience in the Times following our visit last Christmas. We owe a huge debt to his doctor and his nursing staff at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, who have been involved with him for more than a decade, and who have always provided the best possible treatment in the form of medication and advice. That he has not benefited from long-term care is by no means their fault; he himself has usually rejected anything in the form of therapy, though he is visited by a community psychiatric nurse who administers a monthly injection. Above all, I did not want to prejudice my son's position or his future welfare. But I felt, as any parent would, a surge of anger at what I saw. Why should any patient, mental or otherwise, have to suffer these kinds of surroundings? Temporary they may be, but for a patient in the grip of a severe illness, that is small comfort. Moreover, the timing for such an article seemed to be important: both health departments north and south of the border were issuing lengthy reports on reforming the Mental Health Act of 1984. My article appeared just after Christmas. What I had not anticipated was the huge and passionate response from readers. They told stories of isolation and abandonment, of a failure to find help when it was needed most, of indifference, neglect and insensitivity. Watching the onset of the process that Kay Jamison calls 'running fast but slowly going mad' is agonising. Not for the sufferer, but for the onlooker. It is like seeing a car heading for certain collision. You know it is going to end in disaster but you cannot intervene. It begins with behaviour which is merely excitable - fast talking, loud conversation, impatience with the slow and boring pace of the rest of humanity. Grandiose plans must be made, meetings set up, rendezvous made and broken. As the attention span diminishes, so boredom must be banished. Routine medication becomes a tiresome interference with life lived on the edge. Tolerance disappears, to be replaced with irritation. Everyone must be sucked into a whirlpool of activity. It is at this stage that parents or relatives long to take action. If only they could persuade their son or daughter to check into hospital, something might be done. But this is the last thing on the mind of the manic depressive. The 'insight' that he may have acquired into his illness recedes. At the most, this 'florid' behaviour, as it is known, is dismissed as a 'blip'. The last thing he wants to contemplate is the empty routine of life on the ward. Doctors have no powers to intervene. You can alert the hospital and tip off the police, but if the patient is over 21, his or her rights are enshrined and protected. Almost inevitably, behaviour like this, late at night in a pub or on the street, attracts attention and leads to trouble. It can be challenging, aggressive, 'in your face'. At some stage, it may tumble over the edge, to the point where the police become involved. Oddly, the midnight call from the station sergeant comes as a relief. In almost all our dealings with the police, we have found them sensitive, understanding and co-operative. They will alert the hospital and deliver the patient into safe hands. In order to hold him, however, an application has to be made for him to be 'sectioned' under the Mental Health Act. The Act, framed in 1983, was drawn up largely to protect the civil rights of the mentally ill.

One can only hope that those who serve, either as counsellors or on outreach teams, are given proper training and the funding and back-up that has been so conspicuously lacking hitherto. There is still, however, a shortfall in the number of psychiatric consultants, and until this branch of medicine is properly recognised and rewarded, it is hard to see how that can be reversed. What is depressing is that the current discussions, both north and south of the border, place far more emphasis on the issue of 'compulsion' - the use of legal powers to commit patients to hospital against their will - than to the underlying causes that lead to a crisis in the first place. A handful of cases in which mentally ill people have attacked and sometimes murdered members of the public has dominated headlines and the minds of Ministers to the point where this is seen as the most urgent problem to be addressed. Not only are the statistics negligible,but the solution is far more complex and expensive than the easy option of simply locking up more patients. One can read page after page of well-intentioned prose in both the Scottish and the English reports without encountering that flash of compassion and commitment which goes beyond the precise requirements of the law and announces forthrightly: 'What we see here is a scandal. It has been hidden for too long. We are determined to end it.' Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of Sane, the mental health charity, talks of the need to replace 'the lost concept of asylum' and ensure that the beds, the supported places and the skilled staff are there to provide the rigorous risk assessment and care needed. 'The Government,' she says, 'must look beyond the law and guarantee the funding to provide the \"safe, sound and supportive\" system it promised.' There is a terrible familiarity about those sentiments. It is now 15 years since the Times devoted the whole of its leader column to a memorable indictment of Britain's mental health service. Its final paragraph ran: 'It ought not to be beyond the capabilities of British society to recognise the different needs of those who need to make only the one return trip through the revolving door, those who make many return trips, and those for whom the journey is one way for ever. Without such a determined recognition, today's tragedy of mental illness will become tomorrow's public scandal.' It is hard to avoid the conclusion that 'tomorrow' has arrived. The remedy, if it is out there, will only come if we are determined enough to confront the reality of mental suffering, to deal with it head-on rather than treat it as an unpleasant inconvenience from which society has to be insulated. That there has been a recognition of the failure of past decades has, it seems, been accepted. The words, the good intentions, the worthy investigation of systems and procedures, have been delivered. The time has come for action to redress the shameful legacy of past neglect. Britain cannot claim to be a civilised society so long as it turns its back on those who are going slowly mad.

He is a former editor of the Scotsman and is presently a columnist for the Times and Scotland on Sunday A version of this article appears in the current issue of Prospect Mental Illness: The Facts \u0095 One in six adults has a mental health problem. One in 250 has a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia or manic depression. \u0095 Half of all women and one quarter of all men will be affected by depression at some time in their lives. \u0095 Only 40 per cent of women with neurotic disorders have seen their GP in the past 12 months, and just 27 per cent of men. \u0095 Ten per cent of schizophrenics and 15 per cent of those with affective and personality disorders commit suicide. \u0095 During the 1980s, the Conservative Government's policy of replacing hospital care with care in the community resulted in half of all hospital in-patient beds being closed. The number of long-stay residents was halved in five years. \u0095 In 1991, more than \u00a32 billion was saved through care in the community. Only a small proportion of this filtered through to community health services which received budget increases of just 20 per cent. \u0095 The proportion of NHS expenditure on mental illness went down from 15 per cent in 1958 to 10 per cent in 1993. These are the most recent available figures. Chloe Diski",

'In recent years, we have become accustomed to reports of elderly people being sexually assaulted and raped by strangers, but acknowledging that they are routinely sexually abused by carers is far more challenging.' </p> <p>One of the problems is the lack of regulations covering those who can work in residential homes.

The report, by the former civil servant Sir Anthony Hammond, will be a setback for Mr Mandelson, even though he will be cleared of telling lies. Friends said last night that he would still fight to clear his name. The inquiry is expected to criticise the Prime Minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, for acting 'precipitously' in agreeing to Mandelson's resignation when confronted with contradictions in the former Northern Ireland secretary's story. 'The facts are not quite the way he [Mandelson] looked at it,' the inquiry was reported as saying. Downing Street is expected to publish the report the day after the Budget on March 8, leaving the decks clear if Tony Blair decides on an early election date of April 5. Mandelson resigned at the end of January after it was discovered that he had given misleading answers to The Observer over its revelation that he had made contact with the Home Office over a passport application by the millionaire Indian businessman, Srichand Hinduja. Hinduja and his two brothers had donated \u00a31 million to the Faith Zone of the Millennium Dome, a project which was Mandelson's responsibility following the 1997 election win. Opposition parties immedi ately dubbed the affair 'the cash for passports' scandal. Mandelson at first denied that he made a personal telephone call to the Home Office Minister, Mike O'Brien, in 1998. He said it was made by his private office but later admitted that he may have a 'faint recollection' of making the call. Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, then revealed that he had reminded Mandelson of the call the week before The Observer investigation. O'Brien also said that Mandelson had personally made the call. Mandelson insisted to Hammond that he had simply forgotten the timetable of events. He hired lawyers and fought back with a series of interviews which threatened to derail the Government. He complained that he had been dismissed by a 'kangaroo court' made up of the Prime Minister, Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, and Campbell.

      "body": "<p><strong>Wainewright the Poisoner</strong><br>Andrew Motion<br>Faber \u00a37.99, pp305<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000368643,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>Thomas Griffiths Wainewright (1794-1847), the little-known subject of Andrew Motion's intriguing book, was a significant figure in the London of his times: artist and writer, he painted Byron and was a friend of Fuseli and Blake. The form of the narrative is as beguiling as the subject matter. Eschewing straight biography, Motion writes the 'Confession' from the fictionalised first-person viewpoint of Wainewright. </p> <p>At the end of each chapter, he adds 'Notes' - scholarly, biographical information about the real Wainewright. This creates a fascinating alternative perspective to the vivacious but chilling story of the gentleman-dandy artist. After the suspicious death of three relatives, he was charged - though only with the forgery of life insurance documents - and transported to Tasmania. Wilde wrote about him, spookily foreshadowing his own downfall. </p> <p>This mixed-genre study produces a complex reconstruction of its subject, and reinstates Wainewright in his Romantic context. </p> <p> <strong> Underground</strong><br>Haruki Murakami<br>Harvill \u00a38.99, pp309<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000459557,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p> In Tokyo, on 20 March 1995, 12 people died and thousands were injured by a series of gas attacks on subway trains, perpetrated by members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult. Haruki Murakami, a well-known Japanese novelist, investigates through interviews with both victims and cult members the implications for the 'Japanese psyche', posing the question: 'Where did all that come from?' </p> <p>Answers are not explored convincingly, however. There is too much passive recording of interviewees, and too little analysis from the author. We have the impression of Japan as a straight-jacketed, depressingly conformist culture, summed up by a subway employee: 'Work means you fulfil your duties.' </p> <p>Interviews with Aum members merely illustrate general tendencies of cults - obsessive, leader-oriented, millenarian - rather than probing the motivations of this particular group. The reader is left frustrated by a dull book which delivers less than it promises. </p> <p> <strong> Atomised</strong><br>Michel Houellebecq<br>Vintage \u00a36.99, pp379 </p> <p>The French writer Michel Houellebecq's explosive second novel is set in contemporary France 'in the midst of the suicide of the West'. It is a tirade against liberal, individualistic values. The loose plot recounts the lives of two middle-aged half-brothers - Michel, an introverted molecular biologist, and frustrated ex-teacher Bruno, who is constantly in search of sexual satisfaction. Both grew up in the wake of the Sixties political and sexual revolutions. </p> <p>Philosophical insertions, reflections on anthropology and false gurus, and discussions about literature deliberately dismantle the conventional form of the novel in order to say Big Things about Western culture. The humorously obscene commentary about sex lightens the load. Clearly, to the Left Bank type characters, oral sex is the new art form in France, and fellatio is as prevalent as caf\u00e9 au lait. Some will rail against Houellebecq's show-off nihilism, but everyone will ponder the conclusions of the extraordinary Atomised. </p> <p> <strong> Virtual War</strong><br>Michael Ignatieff<br>Vintage \u00a37.99, pp249<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502377907,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>The opening chapters of Michael Ignatieff's brilliant study of the Kosovo war deal with the situation at close range. His reportage from the Balkans includes interviews with key participants and moving reflections of the bombed Belgrade. The control of the material is striking. </p> <p>The chapters that follow reveal Ignatieff's moral thrust, as he explores the concept of 'virtual war', when only the enemy are killed, the Allied Command is in another continent and the media provided 'a light show for Western TV audiences' who've never had to face the body bags of their own sons and citizens. He deconstructs the rhetoric of the war - 'precision violence' - and convincingly argues that democratic decision-making was virtually bypassed (a theme taken up by Tony Benn, but few others). </p> <p>The coherence of this multi-layered critique of 'the first postmodern war in history' makes Virtual War deeply disturbing and hugely impressive. </p> <p> <strong> The Married Man</strong><br>Edmund White<br>Vintage \u00a36.99, pp310<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501024275,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Edmund White's engrossing eighth novel opens in a sensual 1989 Paris. The central character, Austin, a 'Europeanised American' homosexual, is on the verge of new love with Julien, a young, still-married French architect. </p> <p>The third-person narrative lyrically evokes a sense of grand bohemian life.

      "bodyText": "Wainewright the Poisoner Andrew Motion Faber \u00a37.99, pp305 Buy it at a discount at BOL Thomas Griffiths Wainewright (1794-1847), the little-known subject of Andrew Motion's intriguing book, was a significant figure in the London of his times: artist and writer, he painted Byron and was a friend of Fuseli and Blake. The form of the narrative is as beguiling as the subject matter. Eschewing straight biography, Motion writes the 'Confession' from the fictionalised first-person viewpoint of Wainewright. At the end of each chapter, he adds 'Notes' - scholarly, biographical information about the real Wainewright. This creates a fascinating alternative perspective to the vivacious but chilling story of the gentleman-dandy artist. After the suspicious death of three relatives, he was charged - though only with the forgery of life insurance documents - and transported to Tasmania. Wilde wrote about him, spookily foreshadowing his own downfall. This mixed-genre study produces a complex reconstruction of its subject, and reinstates Wainewright in his Romantic context. Underground Haruki Murakami Harvill \u00a38.99, pp309 Buy it at a discount at BOL In Tokyo, on 20 March 1995, 12 people died and thousands were injured by a series of gas attacks on subway trains, perpetrated by members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult. Haruki Murakami, a well-known Japanese novelist, investigates through interviews with both victims and cult members the implications for the 'Japanese psyche', posing the question: 'Where did all that come from?' Answers are not explored convincingly, however. There is too much passive recording of interviewees, and too little analysis from the author. We have the impression of Japan as a straight-jacketed, depressingly conformist culture, summed up by a subway employee: 'Work means you fulfil your duties.' Interviews with Aum members merely illustrate general tendencies of cults - obsessive, leader-oriented, millenarian - rather than probing the motivations of this particular group. The reader is left frustrated by a dull book which delivers less than it promises. Atomised Michel Houellebecq Vintage \u00a36.99, pp379 The French writer Michel Houellebecq's explosive second novel is set in contemporary France 'in the midst of the suicide of the West'. It is a tirade against liberal, individualistic values. The loose plot recounts the lives of two middle-aged half-brothers - Michel, an introverted molecular biologist, and frustrated ex-teacher Bruno, who is constantly in search of sexual satisfaction. Both grew up in the wake of the Sixties political and sexual revolutions. Philosophical insertions, reflections on anthropology and false gurus, and discussions about literature deliberately dismantle the conventional form of the novel in order to say Big Things about Western culture. The humorously obscene commentary about sex lightens the load. Clearly, to the Left Bank type characters, oral sex is the new art form in France, and fellatio is as prevalent as caf\u00e9 au lait. Some will rail against Houellebecq's show-off nihilism, but everyone will ponder the conclusions of the extraordinary Atomised. Virtual War Michael Ignatieff Vintage \u00a37.99, pp249 Buy it at BOL The opening chapters of Michael Ignatieff's brilliant study of the Kosovo war deal with the situation at close range. His reportage from the Balkans includes interviews with key participants and moving reflections of the bombed Belgrade. The control of the material is striking. The chapters that follow reveal Ignatieff's moral thrust, as he explores the concept of 'virtual war', when only the enemy are killed, the Allied Command is in another continent and the media provided 'a light show for Western TV audiences' who've never had to face the body bags of their own sons and citizens. He deconstructs the rhetoric of the war - 'precision violence' - and convincingly argues that democratic decision-making was virtually bypassed (a theme taken up by Tony Benn, but few others). The coherence of this multi-layered critique of 'the first postmodern war in history' makes Virtual War deeply disturbing and hugely impressive. The Married Man Edmund White Vintage \u00a36.99, pp310 Buy it at BOL Edmund White's engrossing eighth novel opens in a sensual 1989 Paris. The central character, Austin, a 'Europeanised American' homosexual, is on the verge of new love with Julien, a young, still-married French architect. The third-person narrative lyrically evokes a sense of grand bohemian life. Well-drawn male characters are rather Jamesian, with the addition of a full and explicit sex life. Tension is created in The Married Man by the clash of values between Austin's European aesthetic and the politically correct puritan ideologies of America, where he teaches for a year. A fellow lecturer advises: 'Just imagine you're in China during the days of the Cultural Revolution.' Returning to Europe, he travels with his now divorced partner, and sometimes with an ex-lover, to Venice, Rome and Morocco. The ancient permanence of these landscapes becomes a poignant reminder of the transience of human love blighted by Aids. A moving and quietly powerful novel.",

      "body": "<p>As a young civil-rights activist working in the southern states in the Sixties, Alice Walker met and fell in love with a Jewish civil-rights lawyer, Mel Leventhal. It was, in the truest sense of the words, a forbidden love; at that time, it was illegal for inter-racial couples to wed in Mississippi. </p> <p>'I came up the steep steps to your air-conditioned offices, wearing my littlest slipping and sliding dress, my slighest sandals, carrying a huge, chocolate, ice- cream cone,' writes Alice Walker in To My Young Husband, the first and most giddily powerful piece in her new book. 'I offered the cone to you after taking a huge lick. You accepted it happily and licked rapturously as if it were the best ice-cream you'd ever had. It was a highly erotic moment, an eroticism heightened by the fact that just by licking the same ice-cream cone a huge portion of the Old South that had kept my soul and my free expression of eroticism chained was forced to fall. That was it, for me.' </p> <p>That was it, too, for young Leventhal, and this was to herald the love affair which led to a wedding in 1967 and a 'movement' child, herself now with her own self-reflective new book just published. Walker and Leventhal parted in some pain in 1976, she eventually to fame and esteem with The Colour Purple and a successful writing career in California, he to a big law practice on the east coast and a new marriage and family. They have only recently been reconciled. </p> <p>Now, at 57, she has recalled that early, electric time in her new book, The Way Forward Is With a Broken Heart, a work that, in the way it deals with relations between the races, could hardly be more timely for a nation whose new President attracted only 8 per cent of the black vote and who owes his position, many feel, to the disenfranchisement of the black voter in Florida. The writing of the book, which is dedicated 'to the American race', and its exploration of love and relationships with both sexes marks for its author the end of a cycle which may even mean, she says, that she never writes again. </p> <p>'It really did seem at times as if our love made us bullet-proof or perhaps invisible,' recalls Walker of the period. 'When we walked down the street together the bullets that were the glances of racist onlookers seemed turned back and sent hurtling off into outer space.' She is writing of a time more than quarter of a century ago, long enough in the past to be taught as history in American schools, but the book concludes with a fear expressed that the country is going backwards and not forwards: 'We are a frightened, broken-hearted nation; some of us wanting desperately to run back to the illusory \"safety\" of skin colour, money and the 1950s.' So what did she mean by that? </p> <p>Walker has taken her boots off and curled her feet under her on the sofa in her large, comfortable home in Berkeley and is sipping a cup of green tea. There is a painting on the wall of Billie Holiday, looking almost Hawaiian, a stack of logs by the fire. On the table are the books she has been reading, one a history of African-American farmers called Homecoming, and the churango that she is learning. Is it difficult to play? 'Not the way I play it,' she laughs. She wears a 'Free Mumia' badge, a reference to the black journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is on death row for the killing of a policeman and who has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among many on the Left who believe he was falsely convicted. Still active politically, she is part of the campaign to free him. She speaks softly. </p> <p>'I think that wealthy white people would like to have a country that resembles the Fifties, when all the minorities were tucked away in ghettos and paid in very low wages but on the surface it was very bright and shiny and free and the rest of the world would look on it longingly,' she says. 'They see the country becoming more and more multi-ethnic and multi-coloured and I think that is quite frightening to them. In the Fifties, everything seemed so great if you were on top but, if you were on the bottom, it was the most horrible of all times. </p> <p>'I think there is a sense of being forced at this time to look at America's really large shadow and that's not all that bad,' she says. 'I don't despair. I know that Martin Luther King would have felt very saddened because he gave his life for a very much larger vision but I don't think he would sit and mourn, and he would try to see the positive side of looking at your shadow.' </p> <p>Walker went to a counter-inauguration protest in San Francisco a few days before George W. Bush was sworn in as the President and finds the prospect of life under his administration depressing. 'Four years of boring repression,' is what she predicts. She voted Green in the last election, mainly because she wanted to support Winona LaDuke, the Greens' Vice-Presidential candidate. 'I wanted in my lifetime to vote for a radical Native American woman since my vision of any future that we might have is that it will be led by women and older women.' </p> <p>She describes the new book as 'the stories that came to me to be told after the close of a magical marriage to an extraordinary man that ended in a less-than-magical divorce'. She also sees the book's completion as the conclusion of a 30-year writing cycle. 'At the moment, I'm thinking that I may write more or I may not because I may want to do something else with the rest of my life.' </p> <p>Her ex-husband, 'beloved' as she addresses him in the narrative, has been happy with the book, she says. 'How could he not love it?' she laughs. 'We spent Thanksgiving together after 20 years of not talking and it was very sweet because when the world that we have been building seems to be fading, we need to be reminded what the vision was originally and it was a good vision. He needed to be reminded of who he is also... he's delving more into that idealistic young poet soul that he was when we met.' </p> <p>By coincidence, their daughter, Rebecca Walker, now 31, referred to in her mother's book as Our Child, has herself just published her own very personal memoir, Black White and Jewish. It explores her parents' relationship and its effect on a child shuttling between a black, initially poor, mother in California and a well-off, white, Jewish father in New York. It is a bittersweet book, dealing with Rebecca's abortion at the age of 14, with drugs and confusion, and with the feelings of loneliness and neglect that came from growing up with a writer for a mother. Often, she would come home from school to find \"goodbye notes\" informing her that her mother had gone away for a week's solitude. </p> <p>Both books deal with some of the same topics, such as the Ku Klux Klan's death threats to the young family in Mississippi. Rebecca describes how 'Daddy sits in sometimes with the rifle and the dog waiting for the Klan to come'. Her description of her own graduation day in San Francisco makes clear the tension that existed by then between her parents: 'My parents are careful and each guarded, both of them skating across the surface studiously avoiding waters they might lack the skill to navigate. My father sits in our living-room like a stranger... my mother sits in a rocking chair, shelling pecans and offering uncharacteristically terse replies.' </p> <p>How did Alice Walker feel about her daughter's book? If it stung her, she won't say so. 'I heard her on the radio yesterday and she was superb. I'm thankful.' The following morning on KPFA, the local radical radio station, Rebecca herself was asked about writing about her mother. She too was guarded, saying only that she feels 'protective' of her. </p> <p>Alice Walker found it more difficult in this new book to write about real events and real people than about her fictional characters: 'Fiction is such a world of freedom, it's wonderful. If you want someone to fly, they can fly. I just saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and what I liked about it was that people could just take off and go.' </p> <p>Her name, of course, was made with her fiction, primarily with The Color Purple published in 1982 and filmed by Steven Spielberg in 1985 with a cast that included Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey. While the book and film brought fame and money and established Walker in the canon of American literature, it also brought criticism, the most wounding of which she dealt with in her book about the film, The Same River Twice. </p> <p>'Of all the accusations, it was hardest to tolerate the charge that I hated black men,' she wrote. 'From infancy, I have relied on the fiercely sweet spirits of black men; and this is abundantly clear in my work.' </p> <p>Such criticism had been painful at first, she said, but she was less affected by it now. 'It's hard to be hurt by people whose views you don't accept, but earlier it did hurt very much. I really did not like being misunderstood. It was painful to me that something that I considered so clearly an expression of love and caring could be taken to be something else. Then I realised that I was dealing with people who were quite cynical and they didn't necessarily believe what they were saying. Once I got that, I didn't suffer so much.' </p> <p>Sha has also been criticised sometimes for what some critics, mainly on the east coast, saw as a new-age agenda. The Color Purple, for instance, is dedicated 'To the Spirit, without whose assistance neither this book nor I would have been written' and she has never shied away from delving into that area with her writing, whether factual or fictional. </p> <p>'The east-coast critics are really afraid of the spirit,' she says. 'I don't feel I've had a decent critic ever on the east coast. There's also that feeling that they have the right to suggest what you should be doing. That's absurd.' It was what she saw as the cynicism of the East Coast that led to her settling in California. 'I feel very happy to be living in Berkeley because there are a lot of people who are politically active here.' </p> <p>Walker was born in Eatonton, Georgia, in 1944, the eighth child of sharecroppers, and grew up in the state. 'But I felt in Georgia and on the east coast generally very squeezed. People have so many hang-ups about how other people live their lives. People always want to keep you in a little box or they need to label you and fix you in time and location. I feel a greater fluidity here. People are much more willing to accept that nothing is permanent, everything is changeable so there is freedom and I do need to live where I can be free.' </p> <p>She shares her home at the moment with a nephew and also has a house in the country, in Mendocino. 'I built it myself. It's a combination of a fourteenth-century Japanese farmhouse and Shinto shrine' and she roars with laughter at her description. 'I'm a pagan Bhuddist who was brought up as a Christian. The pagan part connects me to all of my roots - my African, my Scottish, Irish, Native American, all connected at that pagan root.' </p> <p> As yet, no one has moved in for the film rights of her own love story but talks are under way with director Deepa Mehta about the filming of By the Light of My Father's Smile and with Pratibha Parmar about filming Possessing the Secret of Joy. She is happy about both ventures. </p> <p>She has been a ferociously productive writer of books and poetry and articles, so what would she do if she really does stop writing? She gestures at her churango. 'I'm interested in moving into the space I have created for myself. I lived so much time in solitude, writing 23 books, spending a lot of time in the country, just me and my dog. Solitude was the priority. Now it's the opposite. I spend a lot of time with friends. Life has a completely different flavour. I have time for everyone.' She has recently been in the Amazon and is off to Oaxaca in Mexico next month to study Spanish and to explore caves and volcanic peaks in Hawaii in May. </p> <p>A film crew has arrived on this wet un-Californian morning to interview her about the civil rights heroine, Rosa Parks. So the woman who once received cards through her letterbox in Mississippi telling her that 'the eyes of the Klan are upon you' is now sought for her thoughts and insights by the documentary-makers of California. It has been a long walk. </p> <p><strong> Alice Walker: The Facts</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> 1944</strong> Born in Eatonton, Georgia, the youngest of eight children.

'Not the way I play it,' she laughs. She wears a 'Free Mumia' badge, a reference to the black journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is on death row for the killing of a policeman and who has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among many on the Left who believe he was falsely convicted. Still active politically, she is part of the campaign to free him. She speaks softly. 'I think that wealthy white people would like to have a country that resembles the Fifties, when all the minorities were tucked away in ghettos and paid in very low wages but on the surface it was very bright and shiny and free and the rest of the world would look on it longingly,' she says. 'They see the country becoming more and more multi-ethnic and multi-coloured and I think that is quite frightening to them. In the Fifties, everything seemed so great if you were on top but, if you were on the bottom, it was the most horrible of all times. 'I think there is a sense of being forced at this time to look at America's really large shadow and that's not all that bad,' she says. 'I don't despair. I know that Martin Luther King would have felt very saddened because he gave his life for a very much larger vision but I don't think he would sit and mourn, and he would try to see the positive side of looking at your shadow.' Walker went to a counter-inauguration protest in San Francisco a few days before George W. Bush was sworn in as the President and finds the prospect of life under his administration depressing. 'Four years of boring repression,' is what she predicts. She voted Green in the last election, mainly because she wanted to support Winona LaDuke, the Greens' Vice-Presidential candidate. 'I wanted in my lifetime to vote for a radical Native American woman since my vision of any future that we might have is that it will be led by women and older women.' She describes the new book as 'the stories that came to me to be told after the close of a magical marriage to an extraordinary man that ended in a less-than-magical divorce'. She also sees the book's completion as the conclusion of a 30-year writing cycle. 'At the moment, I'm thinking that I may write more or I may not because I may want to do something else with the rest of my life.' Her ex-husband, 'beloved' as she addresses him in the narrative, has been happy with the book, she says. 'How could he not love it?' she laughs. 'We spent Thanksgiving together after 20 years of not talking and it was very sweet because when the world that we have been building seems to be fading, we need to be reminded what the vision was originally and it was a good vision. He needed to be reminded of who he is also... he's delving more into that idealistic young poet soul that he was when we met.' By coincidence, their daughter, Rebecca Walker, now 31, referred to in her mother's book as Our Child, has herself just published her own very personal memoir, Black White and Jewish. It explores her parents' relationship and its effect on a child shuttling between a black, initially poor, mother in California and a well-off, white, Jewish father in New York. It is a bittersweet book, dealing with Rebecca's abortion at the age of 14, with drugs and confusion, and with the feelings of loneliness and neglect that came from growing up with a writer for a mother. Often, she would come home from school to find \"goodbye notes\" informing her that her mother had gone away for a week's solitude. Both books deal with some of the same topics, such as the Ku Klux Klan's death threats to the young family in Mississippi. Rebecca describes how 'Daddy sits in sometimes with the rifle and the dog waiting for the Klan to come'. Her description of her own graduation day in San Francisco makes clear the tension that existed by then between her parents: 'My parents are careful and each guarded, both of them skating across the surface studiously avoiding waters they might lack the skill to navigate. My father sits in our living-room like a stranger... my mother sits in a rocking chair, shelling pecans and offering uncharacteristically terse replies.' How did Alice Walker feel about her daughter's book? If it stung her, she won't say so. 'I heard her on the radio yesterday and she was superb. I'm thankful.' The following morning on KPFA, the local radical radio station, Rebecca herself was asked about writing about her mother. She too was guarded, saying only that she feels 'protective' of her. Alice Walker found it more difficult in this new book to write about real events and real people than about her fictional characters: 'Fiction is such a world of freedom, it's wonderful. If you want someone to fly, they can fly. I just saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and what I liked about it was that people could just take off and go.' Her name, of course, was made with her fiction, primarily with The Color Purple published in 1982 and filmed by Steven Spielberg in 1985 with a cast that included Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey. While the book and film brought fame and money and established Walker in the canon of American literature, it also brought criticism, the most wounding of which she dealt with in her book about the film, The Same River Twice. 'Of all the accusations, it was hardest to tolerate the charge that I hated black men,' she wrote. 'From infancy, I have relied on the fiercely sweet spirits of black men; and this is abundantly clear in my work.' Such criticism had been painful at first, she said, but she was less affected by it now. 'It's hard to be hurt by people whose views you don't accept, but earlier it did hurt very much. I really did not like being misunderstood. It was painful to me that something that I considered so clearly an expression of love and caring could be taken to be something else. Then I realised that I was dealing with people who were quite cynical and they didn't necessarily believe what they were saying. Once I got that, I didn't suffer so much.' Sha has also been criticised sometimes for what some critics, mainly on the east coast, saw as a new-age agenda. The Color Purple, for instance, is dedicated 'To the Spirit, without whose assistance neither this book nor I would have been written' and she has never shied away from delving into that area with her writing, whether factual or fictional. 'The east-coast critics are really afraid of the spirit,' she says. 'I don't feel I've had a decent critic ever on the east coast. There's also that feeling that they have the right to suggest what you should be doing. That's absurd.' It was what she saw as the cynicism of the East Coast that led to her settling in California. 'I feel very happy to be living in Berkeley because there are a lot of people who are politically active here.' Walker was born in Eatonton, Georgia, in 1944, the eighth child of sharecroppers, and grew up in the state. 'But I felt in Georgia and on the east coast generally very squeezed. People have so many hang-ups about how other people live their lives. People always want to keep you in a little box or they need to label you and fix you in time and location. I feel a greater fluidity here. People are much more willing to accept that nothing is permanent, everything is changeable so there is freedom and I do need to live where I can be free.' She shares her home at the moment with a nephew and also has a house in the country, in Mendocino. 'I built it myself. It's a combination of a fourteenth-century Japanese farmhouse and Shinto shrine' and she roars with laughter at her description. 'I'm a pagan Bhuddist who was brought up as a Christian. The pagan part connects me to all of my roots - my African, my Scottish, Irish, Native American, all connected at that pagan root.' As yet, no one has moved in for the film rights of her own love story but talks are under way with director Deepa Mehta about the filming of By the Light of My Father's Smile and with Pratibha Parmar about filming Possessing the Secret of Joy. She is happy about both ventures. She has been a ferociously productive writer of books and poetry and articles, so what would she do if she really does stop writing? She gestures at her churango. 'I'm interested in moving into the space I have created for myself. I lived so much time in solitude, writing 23 books, spending a lot of time in the country, just me and my dog. Solitude was the priority. Now it's the opposite. I spend a lot of time with friends. Life has a completely different flavour. I have time for everyone.' She has recently been in the Amazon and is off to Oaxaca in Mexico next month to study Spanish and to explore caves and volcanic peaks in Hawaii in May. A film crew has arrived on this wet un-Californian morning to interview her about the civil rights heroine, Rosa Parks. So the woman who once received cards through her letterbox in Mississippi telling her that 'the eyes of the Klan are upon you' is now sought for her thoughts and insights by the documentary-makers of California.

      "body": "<p><strong> Observer:</strong> What's Gabriel's Gift about? </p> <p> <strong> Hanif Kureishi:</strong> The story concerns a 15-year-old boy-man called Gabriel. At the beginning of the book his parents have split up and his father's gone to live in a rather crummy, run-down house in Earls Court. The boy is caught between the two parents and moves between them trying to resolve their conflict, get them back together again, and return to the paradise of his childhood. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Was there a specific moment when you were inspired to write the book? </p> <p> <strong> HK: </strong> David Bowie asked me to write a book for him to illustrate, and we both assumed that this would be a kid's book. But as the book developed it became more of an adult book. And then the Bowie figure crept in and became part of the story. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> How do you think the book relates to your earlier work? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> Well, it's about fathers and sons, which is something that's always interested me, and also about sons being perhaps more talented than their fathers. It's about separation between mothers and fathers, which is always traumatic. It's about people being able to change their lives. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> It's much less polemical than Intimacy. </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> I wanted to write a sweeter book. I enjoyed writing The Buddha of Suburbia. The funny ones are always the most fun to do. Books like Love in a Blue Time, Intimacy and Midnight All Day had been rather dark and melancholic. So I thought it was time to do something else. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> You've written plays, stories, films and novels. Are you first and foremost a novelist? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> When I was a young man I thought I'd give it all a go, and see which one I liked the best, and then after a time I'd settle down and do any one of those things. But actually, I enjoy working in all the forms. I enjoy doing films because I enjoy working with the directors. I like novels because it's so private and you can do anything, and I like writing short stories because you can do them in a week. </p> <p>It's not unprecedented. Someone like Graham Greene always wrote in a number of forms. For me, now, writing is not only a kind of dreaming, but also a profession. In the morning you're dreaming, in the afternoon you're doing your VAT. When you get to middle age and you have three kids, you also think about how you can support yourself and your family for 30 years. So I'm interested in those two sides of my profession - the practical and the dreaming. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> How old are you? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> (pause) Forty six. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Did you always want to be a writer? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> I discovered that I wanted to be a writer when I was 14. It cheered me up because it gave me a great sense of purpose. I knew then where I was going. I was heading out of Bromley. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Was it your father who encouraged you to write? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> He wanted to be a writer - and in a way he was. He wrote two books, which were published, about the history and formation of Pakistan, but he also wrote novels which were not published. He was in love with writing and with the idea of being a writer. It was also the 1960s. You left the suburbs for London, which in those days was swinging. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you think you've managed to get out of the suburbs? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> Whether the suburbs are out of me is another matter. I certainly wanted to come to London to be with people who I thought were cultured. Culture is rather sneered upon in the suburbs. You're considered to be getting above yourself or it's seen as pretentious or financially not viable. So, yeah, I got out. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> So there was never any question of you being anything other than a writer? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> When you leave university, everybody you meet wants to be a writer. And then after a bit you have to decide whether you're really going to do this or whether you're going to be an academic. In 1979 I had a play done at the Soho Poly called The King and Me and then I had a play done at Riverside and I worked at the Royal Court with Max [Stafford-Clark], and so my career started, so far as I ever had one. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Did your dad want his son to go up a meritocratic ladder in English society? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> Well, that certainly happened to my cousins. The men wanted the boys to be doctors, lawyers, or engineers, and not mess around writing stories. We didn't come to England to mess around, you know. My father came from a literary family. My uncles had film magazines, and one of my uncles is a columnist for Pakistan's daily paper. So I did come from a literary background. Being a writer wasn't so unusual. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What was your father's job? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> He worked in the Pakistan embassy. He was a clerk. He left college without taking his exams, got a job and lived a life of frustration, but always with the hope that one day he'd become a writer. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you think you've fulfilled his dreams? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> I've lived the life that he wished he could have, but I think on the whole he would have preferred it for himself rather than for me. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you think that your relationship with your father is the central drama of your creative life? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> My father's story was particularly interesting to me as a writer because he was an immigrant - the experience of coming to England and seeing English society. To be involved in racism is to be involved in the history of your time and post-colonialism. So around the time I wrote My Beautiful Laundrette and then The Buddha of Suburbia I was aware that these were subjects that hadn't been touched much by British novelists. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Is it a burden or a pleasure to be an unofficial spokesperson for a generation of British Asian writers? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> Well at the beginning I was the only one, and then later on there was Rushdie, and now there's Zadie Smith and many other writers from different ethnic backgrounds. There are very few British writers with English names now. They're all called Ishiguro. Or they're Australian. But at the beginning there was pressure on you to speak for what's seen as your community, and of course every writer has to write in freedom and be independent of any kind of orthodoxy. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What does your community think of you? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> I think the young people think of me as an example, sometimes. This bloke, you know, went his own way, wrote these stories and did well. Others think that this bloke is showing us in a bad light, letting the side down. And why doesn't he write stories like Passage to India, as they used to say to me, as if Passage to India was a nice story. But I've always resisted that. I think it could be very damaging to think of yourself as being a representative as a writer. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Who were the writers that you read when you were growing up? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> I liked mostly American writers I think. They seemed sexier than British writers. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> And who do you read now? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> I'm much more likely to read writers from the old days, that I was brought up on. I don't want to spend the morning reading someone else's novel and then sit down and write my own because I know their voice will be in my head. So I'm much more likely to read poetry. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What do you think the writer's job is? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> I think the writer's job is to tell stories that worry about how we live. That worry about the kind of people we are, the kind of values we have and what we might do. Human life has to be thought of and contemplated and worried about over and over again. It's not as if Shakespeare has the final say. We have to think seriously about the fundamental questions of our existence, which is something that other forms, say journalism, television, movies, mostly can't deal with. It seems to me that the novel still is the greatest form of considering the human condition that is available to us. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What are you working on now? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> I've got lots of ideas. There's a novel which I've nearly finished and another one I want to write after that, which will be an overview of race since the 1950s to the present day. With three children it's harder for me to find the time to write. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Intimacy gave you quite a bit of trouble, didn't it? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> The book worked because people got furious, because it seemed as if it was me speaking. It was about something very serious - what happens when marriages go wrong. So I felt that I had written a book that was, on its own terms, successful. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Why do you think they were furious? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> I think they were furious because the subject is infuriating. I might be being disingenuous about that, but I do think the subject of leaving someone or of being left, of being abandoned and the cruelty and your dislike of them is very painful for everybody. I wrote a book that was intentionally horrible. I didn't want to write a book that smooths things over, or that was written about something that happened five years ago. I wanted to write about an event as it happened. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> And you were accused of cruelty. </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> The central character of the book certainly feels cruel and behaves cruelly and couples do certainly behave very cruelly towards one another when they are in that position. I wanted to write a book that seemed to reproduce that. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> In your previous books, the boys and their fathers have been co-conspirators, but in Gabriel's Gift the boy breaks free at the end. Have you broken free of this psychodrama of your relationship with your father? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> I don't think you ever stop thinking about your parents and your relationship with them. You think about your parents a lot when you have children. When I look at my two-year-old I think what was it like for my mother and father when I was two. </p> <p>When you're ageing you think what was it like for your dad when he was nearly 50 and working in a job he didn't like. You always think about them in different ways over and over again, you know, like a painter painting the same face over a period of 25 years. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you think about death? </p> <p> <strong> HK:</strong> Yes, I think about it a lot now. The thing about being in the middle is you can see the end and the beginning and think about what you'll leave behind.</p> <p>\u0095 Hanif Kureishi will read from and talk about Gabriel's Gift at the Purcell Room, London SE1 on 27 March</p>",

I might be being disingenuous about that, but I do think the subject of leaving someone or of being left, of being abandoned and the cruelty and your dislike of them is very painful for everybody. I wrote a book that was intentionally horrible. I didn't want to write a book that smooths things over, or that was written about something that happened five years ago. I wanted to write about an event as it happened. Obs: And you were accused of cruelty. HK: The central character of the book certainly feels cruel and behaves cruelly and couples do certainly behave very cruelly towards one another when they are in that position. I wanted to write a book that seemed to reproduce that. Obs: In your previous books, the boys and their fathers have been co-conspirators, but in Gabriel's Gift the boy breaks free at the end. Have you broken free of this psychodrama of your relationship with your father? HK: I don't think you ever stop thinking about your parents and your relationship with them. You think about your parents a lot when you have children. When I look at my two-year-old I think what was it like for my mother and father when I was two. When you're ageing you think what was it like for your dad when he was nearly 50 and working in a job he didn't like. You always think about them in different ways over and over again, you know, like a painter painting the same face over a period of 25 years. Obs: Do you think about death? HK: Yes, I think about it a lot now. The thing about being in the middle is you can see the end and the beginning and think about what you'll leave behind. \u0095 Hanif Kureishi will read from and talk about Gabriel's Gift at the Purcell Room, London SE1 on 27 March",

      "body": "<p>There was a time when, coming out of a novel, I would hit the ground running. And I knew that if I could just keep on running and not be bothered with all that boring editing and publishing nonsense, I could write another book twice as quickly as the last one. I may even have been right. But not this time. This time, I've come out shuffling. I'm like a jailbird after a long stretch: unready for life, resentful of the separation, nostalgic for the chums I'd been locked up with, and longing to get back inside where I was safe. More strangely, I have unfinished business. I have the feeling that I've written someone else's novel. </p> <p>The novel in question is called The Constant Gardener. It describes a middle-aged British diplomat's search for the killers of his murdered young wife, Tessa. The diplomat's name is Justin, and he is a Foreign Office plodder employed in the British High Commission in Nairobi. The story opens with Tessa's death on the shores of Lake Turkana, in northern Kenya, where she was fatally stabbed and the driver of her jeep decapitated. Her companion and putative lover, an African doctor, apparently fled the scene. The story goes on from there. </p> <p>When and where did the novel begin? I always ask myself this same dumb question, and find myself fudging the answer, because there isn't one. But this time, surprisingly, I seem to have a few pointers. </p> <p> Twenty years ago, on a summer's evening, a black-bearded cyclist in a beret rode through the open double doors of the beer hall in Basel where I was drinking, parked his upright push-bike at my table, and filled my head with the wicked goings on of the multis , as he called them - the giant multinational pharmaceutical companies that have built their grim castles along the banks of the Upper Rhine. His push-bike was painted white. In those days, white bicycles were symbols of revolt, rather as white shirts later symbolised anti-Noriega protesters in Panama. He had been a chemist, he said, but now he was an anarchist because he refused to take part in the poisoning of mankind. Whatever else he told me I have long forgotten, even if I understood it. As a nonscientist, I was more interested in his anarchism than in his chemistry. But as a writer I was secretly enjoying one of those frissons of forewarning: one day, I'll find a way of writing about you and your multis , I thought. And fine: today, 20 years later, I've done it. In the novel, I dump his beard and his bicycle and pour a little cold water on his anarchism. But I keep his multis , and his fury, and take them with me to Africa. And my target remains his target: the bad-boy pharmaceutical companies that, in contrast with ethically minded brothers and sisters in the same industry, would poison the globe if by doing so they could bump up their stock prices. </p> <p>And it must be five years since I was sitting in a small London restaurant when an elegant, grey-suited English gentleman of the drinking class sidled in with a chatelaine's garden basket under his arm and, moving diffidently from table to table, bestowed a bunch of fresh-cut flowers on each group of diners, male or female, young or old: sweet peas, anemones, and pinks. Where there were couples, he was punctilious about addressing the man. 'For your lady, sir, if you will permit me,' he murmured in a bottled Oxbridge voice that could have belonged to a festive Jeeves. Nobody offered him money, and he asked for none. He was not the payable type. Our table got sweet peas. I remember the scent. The proprietress got pinks, for which he received a glass of wine and a kiss. </p> <p>'We call him the mad gardener,' she said as he shyly took his leave, one hand for the basket, one for the doorpost. </p> <p>He was an accountant, she thought, but perhaps a lawyer. He owned a large house with a garden. He had suffered a bereavement. Bestowing flowers gave him comfort. I wrote down the title 'The Mad Gardener,' and I printed it on my bulletin board. I wrote a first page of a first chapter. A bereaved, eccentric Englishman in a straw hat takes himself to live in Morocco. In the evening, he wanders the caf\u00e9s and night clubs, giving flowers to the diners. </p> <p> He arrived on the Monday morning steamer, out of season the way they did, another ageing, sunburned English bloody fool in a grimy white jacket and striped tie, and a Panama hat with what might have been his regimental colours on the band. Next day he was already ambling along the corniche as if he owned it, chucking up his arm at any stray Arab who gave him half a smile, doffing his Panama to the tourist ladies on their hand-held camels. He put up at the Oasis, not the Metropole - the Oasis with its peeling French colonial fa\u00e7ade, and foul food and creaking wooden punkahs in the dining room, being what imperial nostalgics look for. And the Metropole, having all brushed steel and electric doors, being what they are running away from. </p> <p>His name, if anyone cared, was Clapham. 'Like the Junction, old boy. Next stop Battersea. Had it far too easy.' He would confess with a truthless smile, to whoever would listen to him in the fly-blown watering holes favoured by resident expatriates. 'Silver spoon, never did a hand's turn, mustard at exams. Glib, that was my trouble. Terrific charmer, danced with all the ugly girls, thought it was my duty, wasted life, no question,' he would confide, as if formulating the epitaph of a lamented friend who just happened to be himself. </p> <p>But I was foxing the reader a bit here: the person he was really lamenting was his dead wife. I knew it then, and I knew it years later. He was a man in search of a dead love. </p> <p>I pinned the passage beside the title, where it gathered dust for years, until I took it down and shoved it in a file for lost causes. Rereading it now, and comparing it with the novel I eventually wrote, I can spot similarities that still take me by surprise. First, for reasons I can only guess at, I must have decided quite some time back to set the new novel on the African continent, and when I got down to it I stuck to that notion. In the novel, the time is the present: that is to say, President Moi's kleptocracy, which has been in power for 20-something years, and Kenya, socially and economically, is gently going to the devil. Second, when I came to put together my character Justin, I made him as British as Mr Clapham and as gallant, but not yet a failure - rather a time-serving British diplomat in Nairobi waiting to be put out to grass. All the same, 'Clapham like the Junction' is unquestionably an early shot at the character who a couple of years ago, under the name of Justin, barged his way into the novel and took it over, gardening and all. Mr Clapham is what Justin might have become if, instead of marrying a much younger woman, he had taken an early retirement and fallen back on his private money, and set himself up as another expatriate Brit with a left-over life to kill. </p> <p>So those were the bits of the story which seemed to have collected in the bottom of my toolbox: a cycling anarchist, a mad gardener, a whiff of pharmaceutical Switzerland, a spent diplomat in a straw hat, a reluctant yen for Africa and former colonies. </p> <p>And bereavement - why the bereavement? </p> <p>Why did I insist, from the earliest lines of that first mawkish draft and all the way to the finished novel, that my main character had lost somebody very close to him, and was still looking for her? (Tessa was the very antithesis of Justin - headstrong, unswerving, and passionately involved in bringing aid and comfort to Kenya's wretched of the earth, particularly the women folk; it was on such a mercy mission that she was murdered.) Why this determination, suddenly, to write about a close and painful loss when none in recent years, thank heaven, had befallen me? </p> <p>The choice of Africa does not surprise me, though I am always disconcerted to discover with what bravado, with what reckless insouciance, I have committed a couple of years of my life in advance to a subject of which I knew, at the time, next to nothing. Partly, I suppose, there was the lure of getting myself an education. And former colonies have always held an uneasy sway over me, even if my only memories of Africa till then had been lines of striped jeeps queuing up to photograph the same disconsolate lion, and safari lodges swamped with German tour groups. Like many Englishmen of my age, I was brought up to govern the natives of our overseas possessions, and I have always felt embarrassed about that. The expensive English schools that provided me with what we must call an education saw it as their duty to prepare us for the burdens of imperial rule. Once a term, a wandering preacher calling himself a career adviser would descend on our school - founded by King Edward VI and ruled in those days by the rod - and acquaint us en masse with the ways of colonial life in Malaya, Kenya and India. One well-intentioned old gentleman caused a flutter by warning us that anyone who condemned a native to death jolly well ought to attend to his execution. It was our lecturer's definition of fair play. So it's no wonder to me that a sense of colonial guilt lingers over my writing, whether the ex-colony in question is ours or someone else's. Former Palestine, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia, Panama, Ingushetia and Georgia have all been characters in my earlier books, so why not add Kenya to the list? </p> <p>Which leaves me with bereavement , and the most unsettling passage in my 40 years of writing. </p> <p> Sometime back in the mid-70s, I decided to alter my way of working. I had become too sedentary, too much the desk officer, not enough the field man. Imagination and deliberately falsified memory were no longer enough. I deserved, and needed, to share the misfortunes I was writing about. It was time I followed the advice I had rather arrogantly given to a painter friend of mine, to stop painting landscapes for a while and go live in one. Henceforth, I promised myself that if I wanted to write about a place I would go there, whether it was Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Caucasus, or, most recently, Kenya and southern Sudan. In a word, I started writing on the hoof, in the company of whichever secret sharer I had appointed as my main character, and to this day that's what I like to do.</p> <p>For The Honourable Schoolboy, I selected as my ghostly travelling companion the spy and Fleet Street hack Jerry Westerby, For The Little Drummer Girl, the actress Charlie. And now, for The Constant Gardener, the diplomat Justin Quayle. Put unkindly, the process is a kind of deliberately warped journalism, where nothing is quite what it is, and every encounter is examined and, if need be, recast for its dramatic possibilities. The same old corrupt, creative distortions, then, but done from the hip, in the heat of the moment, only later to be reflected on, and rewritten, in tranquillity. </p> <p>And that was how, in 1974 or so, I came to meet Yvette Pierpaoli, in the house of a German diplomat in the besieged city of Phnom Penh, over a stylish dinner served to the clatter of outgoing gunfire from Lon Nol's palace, a hundred yards down the road. Yvette was accompanied by her companion, Kurt - a Swiss sea captain, what else? - and Kurt and Yvette ran a trading company called Suisindo, which operated from an old stucco house in the centre of town. She was a small, sparky, tough, brown-eyed provincial Frenchwoman in her late thirties, by turns vulnerable and raucous, and enormously empathetic. She had all the wiles. She could spread her elbows and upbraid you like a bargee. She could tip you a smile to melt your heart, cajole, flatter, and win you in any way you needed to be won. </p> <p>But it was all for a cause. And the cause, you quickly learned, was an absolutely non-negotiable, visceral requirement in her to get food and money to the starving, medicines to the sick, shelter for the homeless, paper for the stateless, and, just generally, in the most secular, muscular, businesslike, down-to-earth way you could imagine, perform miracles. This did not in any way prevent her from being a resourceful and frequently shameless businesswoman, particularly when she was pitched against people whose cash, in her unshakable opinion, would be better in the pockets of the needy. Suisindo made good profits, as it had to, since much of the money that came through the front door flowed straight out the back, earmarked for whatever good purpose Yvette had set her heart on. And Kurt, the wisest and most long-suffering of men, smiled and nodded it on its way. </p> <p>There is a story I must tell you about Yvette, which I heard at first hand from her, though that is no guarantee that it is entirely true. A Scandinavian aid official, enamoured of her, invited her to his private island off the coast of Sweden. I am deliberately disguising the man's identity, for he was married and a famous womaniser. Kurt and Yvette, by then in Bangkok, were on their financial uppers. A contract was at stake: would they or would they not win the Scandinavian aid agency's commission to buy several hundred thousand dollars' worth of rice and deliver it to starving Cambodian refugees on the Thai border? Their nearest competitor was a ruthless Chinese merchant who Yvette was convinced, probably on no greater evidence than her intuition, was plotting to shortchange both the aid agency and the refugees. At Kurt's urging, Yvette set off for the Swedish island. The beach house was a love nest prepared for her arrival. Scented candles, she swore, were burning in the bedroom. Her lover-to-be was ardent, but she entreated patience. Might they not first take a romantic walk on the beach? Of course! For you, anything! It's freezing cold, so they must wrap up warm. As they stumble over the sand dunes in the darkness, Yvette proposes a childhood game: I stand still. So. Now you place yourself close behind me. Closer. So. That is very nice. Now I close my eyes and you put your hands over them. You are comfortable? I, too. Now you may ask me one question, any question in the world, one only, and I must answer the absolute truth. If I do not, I am not worthy of you. You will play this game? Good. I, too. So what is your question? </p> <p>His question, predictably, concerns her most intimate desires at this moment. Yvette describes them, I am sure, with brazen falsehood: she dreams, she says, of a certain handsome virile Scandinavian making love to her in a perfumed bedroom on a lonely island in the midst of a turbulent sea. Then it is her turn. She spins around, and, perhaps with less tenderness than the poor fellow might have expected, claps her hands over his eyes, and yells in his ear, 'What is the nearest competitive tender to our own for the delivery of one thousand tons of rice to the refugees on the Thai-Cambodian border?' </p> <p>But there was another side to Yvette that friends, and foreign journalists particularly, ignored at their peril. War, as she was the first to admit, turned her on. She savoured danger, rejoiced in it. The drumbeat of gunfire drew her outside like rain after a drought. Much as she deplored war's miseries, she relished its freedoms and its hazards. They spoke to the rebel in her, the adventuress, the gamine. They consoled the adolescent waif who, reduced to starvation, had walked the streets of Paris and borne a love child to a man who had deserted her. War, the great leveller, quelled the ogres that haunted her from her childhood years of poverty and abuse. It was in Cambodia that she discovered its fearful attractions, and they never let her go. </p> <p>By the mid-70s, Cambodia was an archipelago. Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge held the countryside, while Lon Nol, with vast American support, clung to the towns - the largest of which, Phnom Penh, was ringed by the Khmer Rouge in a radius of five to 10 kilometres from the centre. The wealthier journalists stayed mostly at one big old hotel with gardens and a swimming pool, and took taxis to the front for 30 bucks a day, rising according to the distance travelled and the hazards they might endure on the way. In the evenings, they filed their stories, which scarcely changed: it was the waiting time. One day, in the company of David Greenway, then of the Washington Post , I timorously set out for the battle zone, taking with me for protection a wad of plain postcards on which I habitually made notes, usually afterward illegible, and, of course, the secret persona of my fictional journalist, Jerry. Yvette was determined to join us. She had heard of a wise woman capable of amazing predictions who lived in a Khmer village a few miles into the jungle. Greenway was less than keen, and I was too ignorant to know whether to be keen or not, but when Yvette was determined to have her way there wasn't much you could do about it. As our only Khmer speaker, she gave the driver instructions. We drove for an age. The road was a dead-straight canyon cut through mile-high teak trees. Tropical rain was falling in sheets. Through the teeming windscreen, we saw a sinister brown lorry roll out of the jungle in front of us. It stopped, blocking our way. Two boys with guns dismounted, inspected us, and returned to the lorry, which rolled back to let us pass. We were not the quarry they were waiting for. Abandoning our search, we returned to Phnom Penh. I was still shaking when we reached the hotel, and even Greenway looked a little sallow. But Yvette was in a state of grace. She had touched the high mark. She had lived another day. </p> <p>Suisindo owned a couple of clapped-out twin-engined cargo planes for shipping goods from town to town. With Yvette and a Chinese pilot, I flew the delivery round: Battambang, Kampong Chom, and I forget where else. In every town we visited - in every street, it seemed to me - Mme Yvette was a patron saint, the adoptive mother of delighted children, the quiet friend of the bereaved, the bringer of hope and courage, as well as goodies. But what I remember most clearly is returning to Phnom Penh at night, to land on a bomb- pitted, unlit runway while the city winced with gunfire. I was never quite sure what we carried on that plane, and I don't think Yvette knew, either. But I know that while the plane was slaloming between craters, and I was praying to whatever divinity came fleetingly to mind, Yvette was laughing like a child at a fireworks party. </p> <p>Phnom Penh fell, and Suisindo with it. Kurt and Yvette moved to Bangkok and tried to start up again. Kurt died, the business ran into problems, and not even the poor Scandinavian on his island could save it. Yvette consigned the business to a manager and headed for Europe, determined to give the rest of her life to the deprived peoples of the world. And, because she was Yvette, that was very soon exactly what she was doing. Inevitably, the wars drew her. Guatemala and Nicaragua; Bolivia and Colombia; the vilest corners of Africa; and most recently Albania. Sometimes she worked for her own relief organisation, which she called 'Project Tomorrow'. It came as no surprise to any of her friends and backers to learn that she could lobby for support like nobody else on earth. She caught the eye of Mme Mitterrand, and more funds flowed. But, increasingly, she was used by bigger aid outfits, which valued her stamina and fearlessness, her growing expertise, and her determination to go, if necessary alone, where few others would dare. </p> <p>While Yvette was on the trail, it was her pleasure to write or telephone from outlandish places, preferably with outlandish news. When you talked to her in those situations, you listened for other things: Is she all right? Is she ill? Is she in captivity? Am I supposed to be hearing something I can't hear? There is a tribal chief in the Congo who has read your last book and doesn't like it, she might say, or this fortune-teller in Somalia has predicted the imminent collapse of the royal House of Windsor. She never knew what time of day or night it was in England, or if she did she never cared. She assumed that my wife and I would be pleased to hear from her at any hour; and of course we were. A couple of times she came to stay with us in Cornwall, where we spend most of our year. When a deal she had struck in Thailand unexpectedly bore fruit, she bought a pretty little farmhouse near Uz\u00e8s, in the south of France, which was where she had decided to put down her roots. Somehow, between whiles, she contrived to be a marvellous mother of two children . </p> <p>Two days after I arrived in Kenya to look for my new novel - while it was still at the earliest stages of invention, and the nature of my character Justin's bereavement was still a bit of a puzzle to me - Yvette died in Albania, killed in a car accident, together with David and Penny McCall, of Refugees International, and the Albanian driver, while they were on their way to bring practical comfort to a fresh wave of refugees from Kosovo. In foul weather, their car had driven over a mountain pass and fallen several hundred feet. She was 61. Her ashes were buried with both Christian and Buddhist rites in the garden of her farmhouse. Friends came from America, Cambodia, and Thailand to embrace one another in the afternoon sunlight, to stand alone or in pairs at her graveside. Her two children, grown up and well settled, bore themselves with great dignity. It was the most moving funeral that my wife and I have ever attended. In Washington, you may visit the McCall/Pierpaoli Building. It houses the cause Yvette died for: Refugees International. </p> <p> And this is where the story becomes disconcerting, even a little unnerving. This is where we touch on the mystical part of Yvette - I know no other word for it - on her calm, accepting attitude toward the forces that she believed commanded her, on her conviction that certain things in her life were ordained, and that by obeying her inmost instincts and reading the signs and following their instructions she was fulfilling her purpose on earth. She wasn't spooky about it, or boastful. She didn't force it down your throat. But she was sure. Even the most sceptical among us - count me as one of them - would have to admit that destiny or fate or simply outrageous coincidence played an extraordinary and persistent part in her life. You didn't have to share her beliefs in transcendentalism or telepathy, but, when it came to explaining the things that happened to her, it helped. </p> <p>A few years back, she had taken a sabbatical to write her autobiography - it was published in France, Germany, and Italy, but an English version, for some reason, never appeared, even though, for a while, Julie Andrews was planning to play her in a movie. Impatient as ever, Yvette kept faxing me passages for immediate comment. She wrote with flair and frankness and great speed. She had no formal education, but she had read a fair amount, and just as she assimilated languages so she took naturally to the pen. But there was a problem. Her insistence that she was a child of destiny scared the professional writer in me, and I urged her to tone it down. Her life was exotic enough on its own, I argued. She told a tale of love and courage and endurance and vocation - what more did she want? She was a woman of the people, not the gods. Did she really have to attribute her achievements to spiritual guidance and the power of meditation? Might she not be setting herself apart from readers who did not share her spirituality? And so on. </p> <p>Finally, in desperation, I put it to her that she might be risking sales. This appeal to the businessman in her promptly had its effect. Today, I rather wish I had let her write as she believed. </p> <p>Let me throw in a disclaimer here. I am not trying to talk up my novel with presumptuous claim about its genesis. I am trying to trace the origins of a book that anticipated the events - ahead of their occurrence - that provided it with its motivation. The point being - though it makes my toes curl to admit it - that months before I heard of Yvette's fatal accident I had been contemplating as my offstage central character a woman who had become passionately involved in aid work in Africa, and was dead by the time the story opened. In other words, I was calling Yvette Tessa, and mourning her death ahead of the fact. </p> <p>And Yvette was aware of what I was up to. I did not reveal to her, so far as I remember, that I proposed to murder Tessa by the time the story opened. But I certainly told her that I intended to use the backdrop of Africa, and that my heroine was somebody as impossible as herself - a notion she received with joy, but also with some scepticism since she knew very well she was unique. And we were going to meet, and she was going to brief me, probably as soon as I had completed my first field trip. She needed to come to Cornwall again, preferably in a big storm. Why had she never experienced a big Cornish storm? she demanded, as if we had somehow failed as hosts. We had already talked about the African friends I must meet, and most of them, predictably, were in the nastiest places. With Yvette, you expected that and, deep down, you wanted it. </p> <p>And though by age, occupation, nationality, and birth my Tessa was far removed from Yvette, Tessa's commitment to the poor of Africa, particularly its women, her contempt for protocol, and her unswerving, often maddening determination to have her way stemmed quite consciously so far as I was concerned, from Yvette's example. Yvette, like almost no one else, had opened my eyes to constructive compassion, to putting your money and your life where your heart was, and I was not alone in this. Many of the men and women who embraced one another at the ceremony in the garden of her French farmhouse would have said the same. It was Yvette's work, I now realise, that I wished to celebrate when I embarked on the novel. Probably I realised it from the start, whenever the start was. Probably she did. Yet the novel's motor is her death, in the fiction and afterward in the fact. And it was Yvette's presence that, from the moment of her death, steered me through the book. To all of which Yvette would say, 'Of course.'</p>",

And it must be five years since I was sitting in a small London restaurant when an elegant, grey-suited English gentleman of the drinking class sidled in with a chatelaine's garden basket under his arm and, moving diffidently from table to table, bestowed a bunch of fresh-cut flowers on each group of diners, male or female, young or old: sweet peas, anemones, and pinks. Where there were couples, he was punctilious about addressing the man. 'For your lady, sir, if you will permit me,' he murmured in a bottled Oxbridge voice that could have belonged to a festive Jeeves. Nobody offered him money, and he asked for none. He was not the payable type. Our table got sweet peas. I remember the scent. The proprietress got pinks, for which he received a glass of wine and a kiss. 'We call him the mad gardener,' she said as he shyly took his leave, one hand for the basket, one for the doorpost. He was an accountant, she thought, but perhaps a lawyer. He owned a large house with a garden. He had suffered a bereavement. Bestowing flowers gave him comfort. I wrote down the title 'The Mad Gardener,' and I printed it on my bulletin board. I wrote a first page of a first chapter. A bereaved, eccentric Englishman in a straw hat takes himself to live in Morocco. In the evening, he wanders the caf\u00e9s and night clubs, giving flowers to the diners. He arrived on the Monday morning steamer, out of season the way they did, another ageing, sunburned English bloody fool in a grimy white jacket and striped tie, and a Panama hat with what might have been his regimental colours on the band. Next day he was already ambling along the corniche as if he owned it, chucking up his arm at any stray Arab who gave him half a smile, doffing his Panama to the tourist ladies on their hand-held camels. He put up at the Oasis, not the Metropole - the Oasis with its peeling French colonial fa\u00e7ade, and foul food and creaking wooden punkahs in the dining room, being what imperial nostalgics look for. And the Metropole, having all brushed steel and electric doors, being what they are running away from. His name, if anyone cared, was Clapham. 'Like the Junction, old boy. Next stop Battersea. Had it far too easy.' He would confess with a truthless smile, to whoever would listen to him in the fly-blown watering holes favoured by resident expatriates. 'Silver spoon, never did a hand's turn, mustard at exams. Glib, that was my trouble. Terrific charmer, danced with all the ugly girls, thought it was my duty, wasted life, no question,' he would confide, as if formulating the epitaph of a lamented friend who just happened to be himself. But I was foxing the reader a bit here: the person he was really lamenting was his dead wife. I knew it then, and I knew it years later. He was a man in search of a dead love. I pinned the passage beside the title, where it gathered dust for years, until I took it down and shoved it in a file for lost causes. Rereading it now, and comparing it with the novel I eventually wrote, I can spot similarities that still take me by surprise. First, for reasons I can only guess at, I must have decided quite some time back to set the new novel on the African continent, and when I got down to it I stuck to that notion. In the novel, the time is the present: that is to say, President Moi's kleptocracy, which has been in power for 20-something years, and Kenya, socially and economically, is gently going to the devil. Second, when I came to put together my character Justin, I made him as British as Mr Clapham and as gallant, but not yet a failure - rather a time-serving British diplomat in Nairobi waiting to be put out to grass. All the same, 'Clapham like the Junction' is unquestionably an early shot at the character who a couple of years ago, under the name of Justin, barged his way into the novel and took it over, gardening and all. Mr Clapham is what Justin might have become if, instead of marrying a much younger woman, he had taken an early retirement and fallen back on his private money, and set himself up as another expatriate Brit with a left-over life to kill. So those were the bits of the story which seemed to have collected in the bottom of my toolbox: a cycling anarchist, a mad gardener, a whiff of pharmaceutical Switzerland, a spent diplomat in a straw hat, a reluctant yen for Africa and former colonies. And bereavement - why the bereavement? Why did I insist, from the earliest lines of that first mawkish draft and all the way to the finished novel, that my main character had lost somebody very close to him, and was still looking for her? (Tessa was the very antithesis of Justin - headstrong, unswerving, and passionately involved in bringing aid and comfort to Kenya's wretched of the earth, particularly the women folk; it was on such a mercy mission that she was murdered.) Why this determination, suddenly, to write about a close and painful loss when none in recent years, thank heaven, had befallen me? The choice of Africa does not surprise me, though I am always disconcerted to discover with what bravado, with what reckless insouciance, I have committed a couple of years of my life in advance to a subject of which I knew, at the time, next to nothing. Partly, I suppose, there was the lure of getting myself an education. And former colonies have always held an uneasy sway over me, even if my only memories of Africa till then had been lines of striped jeeps queuing up to photograph the same disconsolate lion, and safari lodges swamped with German tour groups. Like many Englishmen of my age, I was brought up to govern the natives of our overseas possessions, and I have always felt embarrassed about that. The expensive English schools that provided me with what we must call an education saw it as their duty to prepare us for the burdens of imperial rule. Once a term, a wandering preacher calling himself a career adviser would descend on our school - founded by King Edward VI and ruled in those days by the rod - and acquaint us en masse with the ways of colonial life in Malaya, Kenya and India. One well-intentioned old gentleman caused a flutter by warning us that anyone who condemned a native to death jolly well ought to attend to his execution. It was our lecturer's definition of fair play. So it's no wonder to me that a sense of colonial guilt lingers over my writing, whether the ex-colony in question is ours or someone else's. Former Palestine, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia, Panama, Ingushetia and Georgia have all been characters in my earlier books, so why not add Kenya to the list? Which leaves me with bereavement , and the most unsettling passage in my 40 years of writing. Sometime back in the mid-70s, I decided to alter my way of working. I had become too sedentary, too much the desk officer, not enough the field man. Imagination and deliberately falsified memory were no longer enough. I deserved, and needed, to share the misfortunes I was writing about. It was time I followed the advice I had rather arrogantly given to a painter friend of mine, to stop painting landscapes for a while and go live in one. Henceforth, I promised myself that if I wanted to write about a place I would go there, whether it was Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Caucasus, or, most recently, Kenya and southern Sudan. In a word, I started writing on the hoof, in the company of whichever secret sharer I had appointed as my main character, and to this day that's what I like to do. For The Honourable Schoolboy, I selected as my ghostly travelling companion the spy and Fleet Street hack Jerry Westerby, For The Little Drummer Girl, the actress Charlie. And now, for The Constant Gardener, the diplomat Justin Quayle. Put unkindly, the process is a kind of deliberately warped journalism, where nothing is quite what it is, and every encounter is examined and, if need be, recast for its dramatic possibilities. The same old corrupt, creative distortions, then, but done from the hip, in the heat of the moment, only later to be reflected on, and rewritten, in tranquillity. And that was how, in 1974 or so, I came to meet Yvette Pierpaoli, in the house of a German diplomat in the besieged city of Phnom Penh, over a stylish dinner served to the clatter of outgoing gunfire from Lon Nol's palace, a hundred yards down the road. Yvette was accompanied by her companion, Kurt - a Swiss sea captain, what else? - and Kurt and Yvette ran a trading company called Suisindo, which operated from an old stucco house in the centre of town. She was a small, sparky, tough, brown-eyed provincial Frenchwoman in her late thirties, by turns vulnerable and raucous, and enormously empathetic. She had all the wiles. She could spread her elbows and upbraid you like a bargee. She could tip you a smile to melt your heart, cajole, flatter, and win you in any way you needed to be won. But it was all for a cause. And the cause, you quickly learned, was an absolutely non-negotiable, visceral requirement in her to get food and money to the starving, medicines to the sick, shelter for the homeless, paper for the stateless, and, just generally, in the most secular, muscular, businesslike, down-to-earth way you could imagine, perform miracles. This did not in any way prevent her from being a resourceful and frequently shameless businesswoman, particularly when she was pitched against people whose cash, in her unshakable opinion, would be better in the pockets of the needy. Suisindo made good profits, as it had to, since much of the money that came through the front door flowed straight out the back, earmarked for whatever good purpose Yvette had set her heart on. And Kurt, the wisest and most long-suffering of men, smiled and nodded it on its way. There is a story I must tell you about Yvette, which I heard at first hand from her, though that is no guarantee that it is entirely true. A Scandinavian aid official, enamoured of her, invited her to his private island off the coast of Sweden. I am deliberately disguising the man's identity, for he was married and a famous womaniser. Kurt and Yvette, by then in Bangkok, were on their financial uppers. A contract was at stake: would they or would they not win the Scandinavian aid agency's commission to buy several hundred thousand dollars' worth of rice and deliver it to starving Cambodian refugees on the Thai border? Their nearest competitor was a ruthless Chinese merchant who Yvette was convinced, probably on no greater evidence than her intuition, was plotting to shortchange both the aid agency and the refugees. At Kurt's urging, Yvette set off for the Swedish island. The beach house was a love nest prepared for her arrival. Scented candles, she swore, were burning in the bedroom. Her lover-to-be was ardent, but she entreated patience. Might they not first take a romantic walk on the beach? Of course! For you, anything! It's freezing cold, so they must wrap up warm. As they stumble over the sand dunes in the darkness, Yvette proposes a childhood game: I stand still. So. Now you place yourself close behind me. Closer. So. That is very nice. Now I close my eyes and you put your hands over them. You are comfortable? I, too. Now you may ask me one question, any question in the world, one only, and I must answer the absolute truth. If I do not, I am not worthy of you. You will play this game? Good. I, too. So what is your question? His question, predictably, concerns her most intimate desires at this moment. Yvette describes them, I am sure, with brazen falsehood: she dreams, she says, of a certain handsome virile Scandinavian making love to her in a perfumed bedroom on a lonely island in the midst of a turbulent sea. Then it is her turn. She spins around, and, perhaps with less tenderness than the poor fellow might have expected, claps her hands over his eyes, and yells in his ear, 'What is the nearest competitive tender to our own for the delivery of one thousand tons of rice to the refugees on the Thai-Cambodian border?' But there was another side to Yvette that friends, and foreign journalists particularly, ignored at their peril. War, as she was the first to admit, turned her on. She savoured danger, rejoiced in it. The drumbeat of gunfire drew her outside like rain after a drought. Much as she deplored war's miseries, she relished its freedoms and its hazards. They spoke to the rebel in her, the adventuress, the gamine. They consoled the adolescent waif who, reduced to starvation, had walked the streets of Paris and borne a love child to a man who had deserted her. War, the great leveller, quelled the ogres that haunted her from her childhood years of poverty and abuse. It was in Cambodia that she discovered its fearful attractions, and they never let her go. By the mid-70s, Cambodia was an archipelago. Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge held the countryside, while Lon Nol, with vast American support, clung to the towns - the largest of which, Phnom Penh, was ringed by the Khmer Rouge in a radius of five to 10 kilometres from the centre. The wealthier journalists stayed mostly at one big old hotel with gardens and a swimming pool, and took taxis to the front for 30 bucks a day, rising according to the distance travelled and the hazards they might endure on the way. In the evenings, they filed their stories, which scarcely changed: it was the waiting time. One day, in the company of David Greenway, then of the Washington Post , I timorously set out for the battle zone, taking with me for protection a wad of plain postcards on which I habitually made notes, usually afterward illegible, and, of course, the secret persona of my fictional journalist, Jerry. Yvette was determined to join us. She had heard of a wise woman capable of amazing predictions who lived in a Khmer village a few miles into the jungle. Greenway was less than keen, and I was too ignorant to know whether to be keen or not, but when Yvette was determined to have her way there wasn't much you could do about it. As our only Khmer speaker, she gave the driver instructions. We drove for an age. The road was a dead-straight canyon cut through mile-high teak trees. Tropical rain was falling in sheets. Through the teeming windscreen, we saw a sinister brown lorry roll out of the jungle in front of us. It stopped, blocking our way. Two boys with guns dismounted, inspected us, and returned to the lorry, which rolled back to let us pass. We were not the quarry they were waiting for. Abandoning our search, we returned to Phnom Penh. I was still shaking when we reached the hotel, and even Greenway looked a little sallow. But Yvette was in a state of grace. She had touched the high mark. She had lived another day. Suisindo owned a couple of clapped-out twin-engined cargo planes for shipping goods from town to town. With Yvette and a Chinese pilot, I flew the delivery round: Battambang, Kampong Chom, and I forget where else. In every town we visited - in every street, it seemed to me - Mme Yvette was a patron saint, the adoptive mother of delighted children, the quiet friend of the bereaved, the bringer of hope and courage, as well as goodies. But what I remember most clearly is returning to Phnom Penh at night, to land on a bomb- pitted, unlit runway while the city winced with gunfire. I was never quite sure what we carried on that plane, and I don't think Yvette knew, either. But I know that while the plane was slaloming between craters, and I was praying to whatever divinity came fleetingly to mind, Yvette was laughing like a child at a fireworks party. Phnom Penh fell, and Suisindo with it. Kurt and Yvette moved to Bangkok and tried to start up again. Kurt died, the business ran into problems, and not even the poor Scandinavian on his island could save it. Yvette consigned the business to a manager and headed for Europe, determined to give the rest of her life to the deprived peoples of the world. And, because she was Yvette, that was very soon exactly what she was doing. Inevitably, the wars drew her. Guatemala and Nicaragua; Bolivia and Colombia; the vilest corners of Africa; and most recently Albania. Sometimes she worked for her own relief organisation, which she called 'Project Tomorrow'. It came as no surprise to any of her friends and backers to learn that she could lobby for support like nobody else on earth. She caught the eye of Mme Mitterrand, and more funds flowed. But, increasingly, she was used by bigger aid outfits, which valued her stamina and fearlessness, her growing expertise, and her determination to go, if necessary alone, where few others would dare. While Yvette was on the trail, it was her pleasure to write or telephone from outlandish places, preferably with outlandish news. When you talked to her in those situations, you listened for other things: Is she all right? Is she ill? Is she in captivity? Am I supposed to be hearing something I can't hear? There is a tribal chief in the Congo who has read your last book and doesn't like it, she might say, or this fortune-teller in Somalia has predicted the imminent collapse of the royal House of Windsor. She never knew what time of day or night it was in England, or if she did she never cared. She assumed that my wife and I would be pleased to hear from her at any hour; and of course we were. A couple of times she came to stay with us in Cornwall, where we spend most of our year. When a deal she had struck in Thailand unexpectedly bore fruit, she bought a pretty little farmhouse near Uz\u00e8s, in the south of France, which was where she had decided to put down her roots. Somehow, between whiles, she contrived to be a marvellous mother of two children . Two days after I arrived in Kenya to look for my new novel - while it was still at the earliest stages of invention, and the nature of my character Justin's bereavement was still a bit of a puzzle to me - Yvette died in Albania, killed in a car accident, together with David and Penny McCall, of Refugees International, and the Albanian driver, while they were on their way to bring practical comfort to a fresh wave of refugees from Kosovo. In foul weather, their car had driven over a mountain pass and fallen several hundred feet. She was 61. Her ashes were buried with both Christian and Buddhist rites in the garden of her farmhouse. Friends came from America, Cambodia, and Thailand to embrace one another in the afternoon sunlight, to stand alone or in pairs at her graveside. Her two children, grown up and well settled, bore themselves with great dignity. It was the most moving funeral that my wife and I have ever attended. In Washington, you may visit the McCall/Pierpaoli Building. It houses the cause Yvette died for: Refugees International. And this is where the story becomes disconcerting, even a little unnerving. This is where we touch on the mystical part of Yvette - I know no other word for it - on her calm, accepting attitude toward the forces that she believed commanded her, on her conviction that certain things in her life were ordained, and that by obeying her inmost instincts and reading the signs and following their instructions she was fulfilling her purpose on earth. She wasn't spooky about it, or boastful. She didn't force it down your throat. But she was sure. Even the most sceptical among us - count me as one of them - would have to admit that destiny or fate or simply outrageous coincidence played an extraordinary and persistent part in her life. You didn't have to share her beliefs in transcendentalism or telepathy, but, when it came to explaining the things that happened to her, it helped. A few years back, she had taken a sabbatical to write her autobiography - it was published in France, Germany, and Italy, but an English version, for some reason, never appeared, even though, for a while, Julie Andrews was planning to play her in a movie. Impatient as ever, Yvette kept faxing me passages for immediate comment. She wrote with flair and frankness and great speed. She had no formal education, but she had read a fair amount, and just as she assimilated languages so she took naturally to the pen. But there was a problem. Her insistence that she was a child of destiny scared the professional writer in me, and I urged her to tone it down. Her life was exotic enough on its own, I argued. She told a tale of love and courage and endurance and vocation - what more did she want? She was a woman of the people, not the gods. Did she really have to attribute her achievements to spiritual guidance and the power of meditation? Might she not be setting herself apart from readers who did not share her spirituality? And so on. Finally, in desperation, I put it to her that she might be risking sales. This appeal to the businessman in her promptly had its effect. Today, I rather wish I had let her write as she believed. Let me throw in a disclaimer here. I am not trying to talk up my novel with presumptuous claim about its genesis. I am trying to trace the origins of a book that anticipated the events - ahead of their occurrence - that provided it with its motivation. The point being - though it makes my toes curl to admit it - that months before I heard of Yvette's fatal accident I had been contemplating as my offstage central character a woman who had become passionately involved in aid work in Africa, and was dead by the time the story opened. In other words, I was calling Yvette Tessa, and mourning her death ahead of the fact. And Yvette was aware of what I was up to. I did not reveal to her, so far as I remember, that I proposed to murder Tessa by the time the story opened. But I certainly told her that I intended to use the backdrop of Africa, and that my heroine was somebody as impossible as herself - a notion she received with joy, but also with some scepticism since she knew very well she was unique. And we were going to meet, and she was going to brief me, probably as soon as I had completed my first field trip. She needed to come to Cornwall again, preferably in a big storm. Why had she never experienced a big Cornish storm? she demanded, as if we had somehow failed as hosts. We had already talked about the African friends I must meet, and most of them, predictably, were in the nastiest places. With Yvette, you expected that and, deep down, you wanted it. And though by age, occupation, nationality, and birth my Tessa was far removed from Yvette, Tessa's commitment to the poor of Africa, particularly its women, her contempt for protocol, and her unswerving, often maddening determination to have her way stemmed quite consciously so far as I was concerned, from Yvette's example. Yvette, like almost no one else, had opened my eyes to constructive compassion, to putting your money and your life where your heart was, and I was not alone in this. Many of the men and women who embraced one another at the ceremony in the garden of her French farmhouse would have said the same. It was Yvette's work, I now realise, that I wished to celebrate when I embarked on the novel. Probably I realised it from the start, whenever the start was. Probably she did. Yet the novel's motor is her death, in the fiction and afterward in the fact. And it was Yvette's presence that, from the moment of her death, steered me through the book. To all of which Yvette would say, 'Of course.'",

The action of this first part starts in 1973 and covers half-a-dozen years, running through the administrations of Heath, Wilson and Callaghan, and ending on the day of the election which brought Margaret Thatcher to power. The main characters are pupils at a direct-grant Birmingham school, King William's in Edgbaston, which is both egalitarian (parents pay no fees) and \u00e9litist (entrance exam). </p> <p>There's a frame to the tale, in which two young people meet in Berlin in 2003, and one of them tells the story to the other, but it's an oddly self-defeating device. If Coe acknowledges the help of a dozen or so books for his reconstruction of a period that he remembers (born 1961, he is a contemporary of his adolescent characters), it's hardly possible that young Sophie, a child of the Thatcher years, could improvise the whole thing with such command of detail, minutiae, for instance, of prog-rock bands thrown out of fashion like so many genteel Rattigans by the Angry Young Men of punk. Her stylised hesitations last only a page or two, and after that it's hard to remember the point of view from which this narrative is supposed to emerge. </p> <p>The idea of using a school as a microcosm of the outside world isn't new, the most celebrated example being Lindsay Anderson's film If..., in which the conflicts of the 1960s were memorably rehearsed. But there's more than enough material in the 1970s to power Coe's story. There is the smug meritocracy of the prefects, for instance, but the school contains darker cabals, more ominous \u00e9lites. There is tension between the school's two star athletes, who also share subjects academically: noble Richards, the only black pupil, and the rancorous Culpepper. When Richards wins the role of Othello in a school play, Culpepper takes no part in the production, but nature has already cast him as Iago. </p> <p>The school-as-microcosm idea, though, works best if the larger world doesn't feature, while, in fact, Coe is constantly bringing in wider issues. It's as if his research into the period has made him burningly aware in retrospect of everything he didn't register at the time, the teenage cluelessness well illustrated in a scene where two schoolfriends are unable to answer each other's elementary questions about current affairs ('Why is Berlin divided, anyway?' 'And why's it called Watergate?' 'Why's petrol got so expensive?' 'Why do the IRA go round killing everybody?'). But it hardly helps his scheme to fill in the blanks, by making the father of one of the schoolboys a shop steward at British Leyland's Longbridge plant, necessarily one of the first to feel the class war changing up a few gears, even before Thatcher. </p> <p>The first section of the book leads up to the bombing of the Tavern in the Town in November 1974, to the very moment of detonation. The family of the book's central character, Ben Trotter, suffers directly, but the narrative skips 18 months at this point and makes only the most gingerly subsequent approaches to the damage done. Ben had a religious experience a little earlier, a miracle, no less, involving the providential appearance of some swimming trunks, but we don't learn how his faith is tested by arbitrary horrors. </p> <p>In place of the agonies of 1970s terrorism, we get a reported encounter, on the Trotters' family holiday in Denmark, with an elderly Jewish couple with tragic memories of the war. Ben is reading Tom Jones at the time and pointed reference is made to an episode in Fielding's book, a 'curious, lengthy digression which seems to have nothing to do with the main narrative but is in fact its cornerstone'. The reader is nudged here to take this section in the same spirit, but it's an effort, and the suggestion made here and elsewhere that there are some moments so perfect they stand outside time, specifically, that the pub bomb detonated too late to destroy a moment of absolute happiness, seems evasive and sentimental. </p> <p>The tone is uneasily comic or, at least, non-serious. It isn't just Ben's conversion that seems curiously not to touch him - other characters also undergo rites of passage that make no difference. One aspiring rock journalist up in London for the weekend finds himself exposed in short order to the Clash in concert and inventive sex with a posh, part-time punk called Ffion Ffoulkes (who whinnies: 'Isn't this topping?' in the act), twin bombshells he takes pretty much in his stride. </p> <p>Some characters exist only on a caricatural level, even if their experiences are dealt with at some length. So Sam Chase, father of another King William's pupil, decides to win back his wife, who is bewitched by the absurdly lyrical overtures of the art teacher, by enlarging his vocabulary. His crash course in eloquent expression is recounted at length, without ever becoming more than a flat comedy situation. </p> <p>Even Ben Trotter comes in for some of the same treatment, in a misconceived episode of farce when he is newly a prefect and trying to make a good impression. It's the sort of routine that might have been written by Tom Sharpe at the time the book is set and leaves a residue of resentful incredulity (why would the chief master's wife remove her artificial hand at a social occasion in the first place?). </p> <p>Strangely, though, the tide can flow the other way, with a minor character taking on an arbitrary depth. So Sean Harding, the school's prankster, turns out to be a devotee of Vaughan Williams, like Ben Trotter, as we learn with equal surprise. The Vaughan Williams motif accelerates from 0-60 in barely five pages, from nothing to everything, and gives birth to a fascinating description by Harding of the English as violent and melancholy - 'We repent afterwards... but first we do... whatever has to be done.' Nothing follows this up. Themes sprout and replace each other like generations of mushrooms and leave as little behind.</p> <p>Works of literature aren't necessarily undone by mixed emotions and incoherent ideas, but The Rotters' Club is altogether too unsure what to mock and what to mourn.</p>",

But there's more than enough material in the 1970s to power Coe's story. There is the smug meritocracy of the prefects, for instance, but the school contains darker cabals, more ominous \u00e9lites. There is tension between the school's two star athletes, who also share subjects academically: noble Richards, the only black pupil, and the rancorous Culpepper. When Richards wins the role of Othello in a school play, Culpepper takes no part in the production, but nature has already cast him as Iago. The school-as-microcosm idea, though, works best if the larger world doesn't feature, while, in fact, Coe is constantly bringing in wider issues. It's as if his research into the period has made him burningly aware in retrospect of everything he didn't register at the time, the teenage cluelessness well illustrated in a scene where two schoolfriends are unable to answer each other's elementary questions about current affairs ('Why is Berlin divided, anyway?' 'And why's it called Watergate?' 'Why's petrol got so expensive?' 'Why do the IRA go round killing everybody?'). But it hardly helps his scheme to fill in the blanks, by making the father of one of the schoolboys a shop steward at British Leyland's Longbridge plant, necessarily one of the first to feel the class war changing up a few gears, even before Thatcher. The first section of the book leads up to the bombing of the Tavern in the Town in November 1974, to the very moment of detonation. The family of the book's central character, Ben Trotter, suffers directly, but the narrative skips 18 months at this point and makes only the most gingerly subsequent approaches to the damage done. Ben had a religious experience a little earlier, a miracle, no less, involving the providential appearance of some swimming trunks, but we don't learn how his faith is tested by arbitrary horrors. In place of the agonies of 1970s terrorism, we get a reported encounter, on the Trotters' family holiday in Denmark, with an elderly Jewish couple with tragic memories of the war. Ben is reading Tom Jones at the time and pointed reference is made to an episode in Fielding's book, a 'curious, lengthy digression which seems to have nothing to do with the main narrative but is in fact its cornerstone'. The reader is nudged here to take this section in the same spirit, but it's an effort, and the suggestion made here and elsewhere that there are some moments so perfect they stand outside time, specifically, that the pub bomb detonated too late to destroy a moment of absolute happiness, seems evasive and sentimental. The tone is uneasily comic or, at least, non-serious. It isn't just Ben's conversion that seems curiously not to touch him - other characters also undergo rites of passage that make no difference. One aspiring rock journalist up in London for the weekend finds himself exposed in short order to the Clash in concert and inventive sex with a posh, part-time punk called Ffion Ffoulkes (who whinnies: 'Isn't this topping?' in the act), twin bombshells he takes pretty much in his stride. Some characters exist only on a caricatural level, even if their experiences are dealt with at some length. So Sam Chase, father of another King William's pupil, decides to win back his wife, who is bewitched by the absurdly lyrical overtures of the art teacher, by enlarging his vocabulary. His crash course in eloquent expression is recounted at length, without ever becoming more than a flat comedy situation. Even Ben Trotter comes in for some of the same treatment, in a misconceived episode of farce when he is newly a prefect and trying to make a good impression. It's the sort of routine that might have been written by Tom Sharpe at the time the book is set and leaves a residue of resentful incredulity (why would the chief master's wife remove her artificial hand at a social occasion in the first place?). Strangely, though, the tide can flow the other way, with a minor character taking on an arbitrary depth. So Sean Harding, the school's prankster, turns out to be a devotee of Vaughan Williams, like Ben Trotter, as we learn with equal surprise. The Vaughan Williams motif accelerates from 0-60 in barely five pages, from nothing to everything, and gives birth to a fascinating description by Harding of the English as violent and melancholy - 'We repent afterwards... but first we do... whatever has to be done.' Nothing follows this up. Themes sprout and replace each other like generations of mushrooms and leave as little behind. Works of literature aren't necessarily undone by mixed emotions and incoherent ideas, but The Rotters' Club is altogether too unsure what to mock and what to mourn.",

I have decided to name Christopher Hitchens.' Younger readers may need to be told that Gore Vidal is a novelist, a writer of fictions, a romancier or romanziere. I think Mr Hitchens can do rather better than that, to be honest. </p> <p>Hitchens is a member of that brilliant group of writers which emerged in London in the mid to late 1970s, around Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis, James Fenton and Julian Barnes. Fashion has moved on somewhat, and they are no longer where it's at, but the conversational, self-conscious brilliance of the group retains a considerable fascination.</p> <p>In all of them, there is a polemical edge forged in the ideological battles of the last days of the Callaghan government; Fenton's journalism, Amis's writings on the arms race (now quite wonderful period pieces), Rushdie's dazzlingly vicious romp through the politics of Pakistan in Shame remain not incidental activities, but prose fantasies which are, in each case, at the heart of their imaginative creations. </p> <p>Hitchens alone, however, has devoted his considerable energies solely to the ends of polemic. If journalism and pamphleteering, being unavoidably ephemeral activities, will, in the end, make him seem like the Saxon Sydney-Turner of the group, at any rate he has many more claims on our attention than a mere journalist could ordinarily hope for. This punchily authoritative and sparky collection passes a supreme test for the reader; he keeps your interest, even when you haven't the faintest idea what he is talking about. </p> <p>In my case, this represents quite a lot of the book, since Hitchens is deeply enmeshed in American politics and culture. An essay on the memoirs of Norman Podhoretz, the ex-editor of a US magazine called Commentary, would normally sound to me like the sort of thing to pass over rapidly. If, like me, you don't go to America, hardly ever read American magazines or books, and have never heard of Podhoretz, his friends, his enemies or his magazine, then it might as well be an account of a feud between Tunisian troglodytes. But the essay is so amusingly offensive, starting from the truthful insight that 'you can't make old friends', that you read it gleefully. </p> <p>America looms large in Hitchens's writings, but one of the pleasures of this book is seeing its public life, which is saturated with pomposity, described by someone who is never pompous. Very occasionally, Hitchens slides into the puffed-up phraseologies of American journalism - 'I submit that, despite a few infelicities like \"main\" and \"remain\", this is very finely written.' But for the most part, he is swift, devastating and alert. Plenty of people have groaned before the dismal genre of 'the Washington novel'; few, however, have had the wit to notice that they always have exactly the same cast and always include the British ambassador. Hitchens has the sense to point out this mysteriously hilarious fact, and trusts the reader to mull on the implications; anyone else would have ploddingly explained the insight. </p> <p>He is at his best when fixing on a small, apparently trivial detail. Presenting Orwell's basic decency and fairness, he notices that between the proof and the final text of Animal Farm, Orwell changed one sentence about the destruction of the windmill from: 'All the animals including Napoleon flung themselves on their faces' to 'All the animals except Napoleon...' 'It weighed with him,' Hitchens says, 'that Stalin had remained in Moscow during the Nazi advance on the city.' </p> <p>Those textual details are often missed by inattentive readers and critics, and a reader who sees how important they can be is to be cherished. He loves the philosopher who ridicules Isaiah Berlin for substituting, in the second edition of Four Essays on Liberty, Thomas Hobbes for the first edition's Thomas Aquinas, 'as if it had to be Thomas somebody', and draws large, fair conclusions about Berlin's essential second-rateness from an apparently minor textual change. They are large comments on small details, but never strike one as nitpicking. Rather, it seems as if in the local life of texts, a small, unobserved change can reveal an author for what he is, either for good, as in Orwell, or bad, as in Berlin. </p> <p>Hitchens has a mildly problematic relationship with his own origins - we have it on Martin Amis's authority that he makes it a point of honour that the late discovery of his Jewish ancestry will in no way alter his stance on the state of Israel - and the most fascinating essays here are those which bear on questions of Englishness.</p> <p>There is nothing direct, but a long essay on Anthony Powell is a circling meditation on the question. It is surely a sense of national history, for instance, that leads him to propose the war sequence in A Dance to the Music of Time as its strongest volume. Elsewhere, he says: 'In the decades of silence that intervened before the inaugural volume of Dance...' In fact, it was just 12 years, not counting the book about John Aubrey, but Hitchens's point is that between the ancien regime and the nuclear age, a huge gulf of willed national suffering opened up. It will not quite do, but it makes an interesting point. </p> <p>Hitchens, of course, is a first-rate hater and what the book will be bought for is a collection of terrifically insulting, urbane demolitions of excessive reputations.

After the first flush of rebellious pride, I remember realising that the editor, whom I respected, intended no compliment. </p> <p>Pilger's reporting, particularly on television, has sharply divided the journalistic world. There were the loyal minority who cried: 'Thank god for Pilger' and the vociferous majority who damned his side-taking and campaigning style as 'too much' and 'simply not done'.

In such circumstances, perhaps, our author feels that criticism is a luxury we cannot afford. </p> <p>Hayward's catalogue does at least serve to remind us of the extraordinary quantity of Pilger's oeuvre and the conflict it has generated with authority. From his first film for World in Action - The Quiet Mutiny (1970), about the collapse of American morale in Vietnam, there was the ITV regulator trying to get Granada to get him to rewrite the script. And there was Granada's heroic boss, Sidney Bernstein, personally committing himself to defending his company's right to put out a dissenting view. Would that today's Granada bosses recognised an issue. </p> <p>Hayward points out that by 1999 the ITV regulator was clinging on to Pilger's output - on East Timor and on the plight of aborigines in Australia. The ITC, expressing concern about lightweight factual programmes on ITV, cited Pilger's Australian film as 'one of a small band of outstanding films'. </p> <p>Pilger's love-hate relationship with the British establishment, in whose backyard he has toiled for most of his working life, is an intriguing one, yet this book never resolves it. The appendix solemnly lists every award he has won; indeed, just about every film he ever made won something. The best and most hilarious one seems to have been the Richard Dimbleby Award (Bafta) in 1991 for factual reporting. David Dimbleby condemned it and Robin Day refused to give it. We are told how thrilled Pilger was to get it, but the writer fails to tell us what I suspect is also true, that Pilger was even more excited to have provoked such a display of hostility against him. </p> <p>For this is Pilger's brilliance, the whipping up of public debate and conflict about what he has done. Pilger never lets a sleeping dog lie. Reporting on everything from Cambodia to Burma, from Nicaragua to the sanctions against Iraq, his films are only part of the story. Again, this book leaves the reader to try to piece together how Pilger actually works. Articles are penned to accompany the films, letters are written, debates are opened in newspaper columns, the occasional libel action action is threatened against him or actually brought. The Pilger film, whatever it is about, becomes a major publishing event.</p> <p>In the early days, the TV company could not drop it for fear of these very public consequences; likewise the regulator dared not cut it. Today, the TV company is only likely to be satisfied if there is a thorough-going row, spattered across yards of newsprint. The regulator does not tinker with it because of the utter ITV current affairs void in which it is being transmitted. </p> <p>In the Name of Justice is a pro-Pilger book. I don't doubt that he has exposed some terrible injustices, but his campaigning is worthy of further discussion. He is, in the end, a celebrated, full-time rebel member of the very establishment he despises.

After the first flush of rebellious pride, I remember realising that the editor, whom I respected, intended no compliment. Pilger's reporting, particularly on television, has sharply divided the journalistic world. There were the loyal minority who cried: 'Thank god for Pilger' and the vociferous majority who damned his side-taking and campaigning style as 'too much' and 'simply not done'. Some argue the ends justify his means, others that the world is a more subtle place than he allows. These divisions are not seriously explored in this book. While In the Name of Justice is full of detail about the places Pilger's been, the reports he filed, and even the number of phone calls that the programmes generated, it is largely devoid of analysis.

In fact, it's a dreadful phrase which Carlyle almost dreamt up in 1839 in his pamphlet, 'Chartism', which attacked materialism and laissez-faire. The noun nexus (from the Latin verb 'to bind') dates in English from 1663 and Carlyle referred to 'Cash payment... the universal sole nexus of man to man'. </p> <p>Books about money are two a penny, but the professor of political and financial history at Oxford has attempted something more ambitious, no less a subject than 'Money and Power in the Modern World, 1700-2000'. He confesses that the book was originally intended to be a history of the bond markets, for which he received a grant to conduct research at the Bank of England, where a man's word is traditionally his bond. While inspired by the bond markets, Ferguson felt fettered by them. At all events, the history of the bond markets was confined largely to one sensational chapter; having defaulted on his bond with the Bank, Ferguson broadened his scope, thereby raising the return for the general reader. </p> <p>Much of the book constitutes old wine in new bottles, but is no less tasty for that. It is no great revelation that taxation and warfare are closely related, and that raising money via the bond market is, for governments, a form of deferred taxation. Nor is it earth-shattering news that via warfare, revolution, reform and necessity, we have arrived at a position where the modern nation contains a 'square of power': first, a tax-gathering bureaucracy; second, parliamentary institutions which authorise taxation; three, a system of national debt; four, a central bank that manages that debt. But the story of how that 'square of power' evolved is brilliantly sketched. </p> <p>There is nothing new about governments being fearful of those markets. During the Napoleonic wars, Britain had a debt to gross domestic product ratio that would not have gone down well with the modern markets. Ferguson also takes a neat swipe at the modern view that public sector borrowing is guilty, unless proved innocent, of 'crowding out' borrowing by the private sector. Indeed, so far from 'crowding out' the private sector, the development of the government bond market created new opportunities for corporate borrowers to capitalise on. </p> <p>Ferguson almost puts himself on the side of anti-globalisation protesters in taking issue with the fashionable view, as expressed by the New York Times commentator, Thomas Friedman, not only that the financial markets have become the supreme power, but that this is a good thing. As he avers: 'To say financial markets rule the world is to say the plankton rule the sea.' </p> <p>He is good on the parallels and differences between the current phase of heavy international trade and investment and the period before the First World War, and he places Friedman's view that the interlocking trade and investment relationships of 'globalisation' diminish the chance of war firmly in historical perspective. </p> <p>Economic rationality does not discourage war. Indeed, one of the purposes of this book is to point to the limits of the 'cash nexus' in human motivation. Thus, the 'profits' of war have usually been less than the costs of the war that secured them. Ferguson also emphasises that Germany after the First World War paid far less in reparations than had been demanded. He seems to be surprised that Germany embarked on territorial expansion again, but then Mein Kampf demonstrated that the humiliation of Versailles had a huge impact on Hitler. </p> <p>The book draws towards its conclusion with a passionate plea that 'far from retreating like some giant snail behind an electronic shell, the United States should be devoting a larger percentage of its vast resources to making the world safer for capitalism and democracy'. </p> <p>Ferguson is, to my mind, much too sceptical about the potential for Europe.

He left school at 16 and went straight into trade. After making a financially advantageous marriage, he became manager of a profitable textile business, a member of several City companies, London clubs and national societies, and extensive traveller. </p> <p>Yet Ashbee's was a Janus-faced respectability. A voracious reader, scholar and confirmed bibliophile, when he died in 1900 he bequeathed to the British Museum a library running to thousands of volumes, which included the most extensive collection of private, top-shelf literature ever to have come into the 'public' domain.

Under the 'scatological pseudonym' of 'Pisanus Fraxi', he privately printed three bibliographies that established him as Britain's leading authority on pornography. </p> <p>The Erotomaniac is divided in two parts, mirroring 'the double life of considerable deviousness' of Gibson's subject. The first, dealing with Ashbee's life and career, uncovers the open secret that the textile magnate was, in fact, erotic bibliomaniac Pisanus Fraxi, indefatigable compiler of Index Librorum Prohibitorum (1877), Centuria Librorum Absconditorum (1879) and Catena Librorum Tacendorum ('String of Books Worthy of Being Silenced') (1885). </p> <p>The second part Gibson devotes to his extensive investigation to prove Ashbee's authorship of the 'anonymous sex marathon', My Secret Life. Attribution of this 4,200-page erotic extravaganza, purporting to be the edited journal of the secret sexual life of a Victorian gentleman, has long provoked fierce literary debate, to which Gibson brings a raft of new evidence pointing towards Ashbee. </p> <p>Gibson's life of Ashbee provides the reader with a peep through the keyhole onto a remarkable male network of manic erotic bibliophiles. Ashbee's 'coterie of erotomaniac cronies' included Richard Monckton Milnes (Lord Houghton), James Campbell Reddie, Sir Richard Burton (Ashbee's abiding hero) and the somewhat unfortunately named Frederick Hankey. </p> <p>Ashbee and his influential friends met or corresponded almost daily to pursue their kindred 'clandestine' tastes. Collectively, they got hot under their highly starched collars about an obscene profusion of textual practices. They pawed over detailed indexes, sighed over rare editions and arm-wrestled one another over footnotes in an orgy of bibliographic fetishism. Gibson shows that Ashbee spent most of his time in the company of likeminded men. And this is the point - the only thing that made these activities 'secret' is that they took place out of the view of wives, children and economic subordinates, except, of course, the prostitutes and mistresses who serviced the fantasy. </p> <p>Gibson is a great entertainer. His account of Ashbee's interest in the quintessential 'vice anglais' makes flagellation fun, as did Ashbee, by focusing in detail on the methodology of its most notable practitioners. Still, the 'agony of correction' in Ashbee's life generally refers to proofs not perversion. Ashbee's real obsession was ever with the sensational effects of the titillating text. </p> <p> The Erotomaniac reveals that the chief agents of subversion of the Victorian ideal were its most eminent propagators. There is nothing particularly new in this idea. Gibson's achievement, however, is to illustrate with great humour the kinship between capitalism and perversion. </p> <p>Punctilious editing, logging of statistics, creative accounting, pedantic detail, endless repetition, obsessive dedication - Ashbee tackled his project of transforming sex into text in the same spirit as he did free trade. The Victorian patriarchs, Gibson suggests, approached their sexual culture as commerce - with enthusiastic entrepreneurial spirit, energetic productivity, the unflagging desire to extract maximum surplus from all resources and extreme exploitation of women, children and other races. </p> <p>Most striking is the fact that in the great age of prohibition this compulsive erotic bibliographer, translator, diarist, polemicist, and (probably) novelist was never once subject to any real state censorship. In spite of his lifelong claim to be a campaigner against the 'ultra-squeamishness and hyper-prudery' of the English, Ashbee constructed a self-regulating economy of erotica unrestricted by anything except his own ambivalence. </p> <p>For all its embellishment and brio, there is a devastating family drama at the heart of this biography. As Ashbee grew older and more Tory, he became increasingly alienated from his comparatively progressive family. The 'excessive education' of his daughters irritated him, his Jewish wife's pro-suffragism infuriated him, and he became tragically estranged from his socialist, homosexual son, Charles. </p> <p>The Oedipal threat posed by his son was the threat to all Victorianism: lifting the lid on the myth of prohibition that was, in fact, the protectionism of patriarchy. Socialist sons and educated wives and daughters who answered back threatened to ruin the furtive, often violent, fun of Ashbee and his friends. Ashbee's intention, like that of many dedicated pornographers throughout history, was to prove heterosexuality normal. His own marriage was a disastrous threat to this conceit of mastery. </p> <p>The real shock of what happens in Ashbee's life is not in his clandestine activities, but in the repercussions of what happens one day in his own home. Through its careful documentation of Ashbee's writing and bibliophilia, The Erotomaniac builds an epic account of Victorian impropriety while retaining its intention to be a straight biography. In the end, this makes Gibson himself something of an erotic bibliomaniac. </p> <p>It is to his credit that one can say of The Erotomaniac what was written about Ashbee's work by one of his most admiring critics: 'It is extraordinary to find a work on erotic literature - a subject that is generally tabooed - treated by a lover of literature and written about by a gentleman in such a manner as to convince the reader that his object is the dissemination of knowledge, and not the gratifying of a prurient curiosity.' Fortunately, our own age grants a little more licence unashamedly to gratify the knowledgeably prurient.</p>",

      "body": "<p>After two memorable, sharply contrasting American movies - the western, Hi-Lo Country, and the urban comedy, High Fidelity - Stephen Frears has returned to Britain with Liam, a tough, anti-nostalgic period movie. Frears began his directorial career 30 years ago with Gumshoe, a sprightly comedy-thriller set in a confident Beatles-era Liverpool. His new film is located in a very different prewar Merseyside and is written by an altogether more aggressive Liverpool author, Jimmy McGovern, who wrote the gritty Priest and the Cracker series. </p> <p>Liam is situated between, and obviously influenced by, some notable British films of a couple of years back that also draw on childhood memories of Liverpool. On the one hand, there is Terence Davies's trilogy, Distant Voices, Still Lives and The Long Day Closes, about a lonely, working-class Catholic boy with a brutal father growing up in the 1940s and 1950s in a world dominated by women and finding consolation in movies and popular music. On the other is Ken Loach's Land and Freedom, in which an unemployed Liverpool docker, played by Ian Hart, turns his seething political anger to positive purposes by volunteering to serve with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. </p> <p>Liam is largely seen through the eyes of its eponymous seven-year-old hero (Anthony Borrows) and has the elliptical, slightly abstract quality of Davies's film. Its dominant male character, a working-class father played by Ian Hart, faces the same political options as the protagonist of Land and Freedom, though they make radically different choices. </p> <p>Liam begins on New Year's Eve, traditionally a moment of hope. But this is Liverpool in the early years of the Depression, a drab, killjoy time with the threat of imminent unemployment hovering in the poisonous air. A pompous policeman intimidates children outside a pub and then reduces their singing parents inside to silence by his mere appearance; the bar is not licensed for music and dancing. As the New Year celebrations extend into the early hours, the shape of social fissures to come is forecast in a nasty row between two women, one Catholic, the other Protestant, who have to be parted. A father looks proudly on as his elder son vomits in the backyard after his first bout of manly drinking. </p> <p>Thereafter, a visually and dramatically schematic film is punctuated by the image of fire, real and imagined. Dad is still at work and white-hot rivets are hammered into ships in a dry dock. Little Liam is being prepared for his first communion and his first confession at a primitive parochial school where a female teacher and a bullying priest drill into him the fear of hellfire. </p> <p>Just before a copy of the Liverpool Post goes up in flames while drawing a morning fire, we read headlines of dole queues and Ramsay MacDonald's coalition government. Liam sees hell in the road-menders' brazier and the blacksmith's furnace and, in the climactic scene, by a terrible, melodramatic irony, a human being is turned into a blazing torch. </p> <p>Dad is soon laid off, becomes obsessed with scabs and cheap labour from Ireland and rants against Jewish exploiters. Liam is tortured by an induced sense of sin (seeing his mother naked is a traumatic experience), feels guilty about the suffering around him and his already chronic stammer, one of the most convincing I have ever seen or heard in a film, becomes paralytic. His 14-year-old sister, Theresa (Megan Burns), goes into service with a well-off Jewish family, who own the dock where Dad worked, and she finds herself carrying messages between her employer's wife and her young lover. </p> <p>Liam's mother (Claire Hackett), a devout Catholic, desperately tries to hold the family together. But finally she turns on her husband when he goes berserk and denounces the church's venality during Liam's first communion and then becomes a militant member of Oswald Mosley's Blackshirts. Like his communist opposite number in Land and Freedom, he ends up crushed and disillusioned. </p> <p>This is heady, uncompromising stuff that hits you at gut level, often below the belt in the way McGovern's Priest did. The performances have a raw humanity that makes us feel sympathy for Dad, even when he goes beyond the pale. But the subjective viewpoints, whether Liam's, Theresa's or Dad's, make it impossible to view this narrowly conceived section of society with anything approaching objectivity. I'm also more than a trifle uneasy about the way the perceived exploiters - the dock owner, the pawnbroker, the rent collector - are all Jews. I'm also not convinced that a Blackshirt speaker would attack the Irish; from the start, the Mosleyites attracted a lot of support from anti-communist Catholics and stood behind Franco in 1936. </p> <p>It is, however, a powerful movie about divisive issues that were kept from our screens at the time by the British Board of Film Censors. The most hard-hitting play of the decade, Love on the Dole, couldn't be filmed until 1941, by which time it was history. </p> <p> Liam touched on deep, personal feelings for me. I grew up on Merseyside in the 1930s and 40s, all the members of my father's family worked in the docks or went to sea, and as Protestants they never spoke to their slightly better-off Catholic relatives. Anti-Semitism was rife among my parents' friends and at my school, and I recall that when at the 1945 general election the Labour Party put up a Jewish lawyer (a KC called Voss) against the incumbent Tory, Sir Malcolm Bullock, in Crosby, a local councillor said at a public meeting: 'I think I can rely upon you all to vote Conservative, but anyway I cannot believe you would vote for a Jew.' </p> <p>At that time, I had a chronic, almost disabling stammer, like Liam's. But in 1948, when I moved to Bristol with my parents, I had Jewish schoolfriends for the first time, I began to read Catholic writers and in this fresh, new air my stammer began steadily to abate, though it was never to disappear.</p>",

On the one hand, there is Terence Davies's trilogy, Distant Voices, Still Lives and The Long Day Closes, about a lonely, working-class Catholic boy with a brutal father growing up in the 1940s and 1950s in a world dominated by women and finding consolation in movies and popular music. On the other is Ken Loach's Land and Freedom, in which an unemployed Liverpool docker, played by Ian Hart, turns his seething political anger to positive purposes by volunteering to serve with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. Liam is largely seen through the eyes of its eponymous seven-year-old hero (Anthony Borrows) and has the elliptical, slightly abstract quality of Davies's film. Its dominant male character, a working-class father played by Ian Hart, faces the same political options as the protagonist of Land and Freedom, though they make radically different choices. Liam begins on New Year's Eve, traditionally a moment of hope. But this is Liverpool in the early years of the Depression, a drab, killjoy time with the threat of imminent unemployment hovering in the poisonous air. A pompous policeman intimidates children outside a pub and then reduces their singing parents inside to silence by his mere appearance; the bar is not licensed for music and dancing. As the New Year celebrations extend into the early hours, the shape of social fissures to come is forecast in a nasty row between two women, one Catholic, the other Protestant, who have to be parted. A father looks proudly on as his elder son vomits in the backyard after his first bout of manly drinking. Thereafter, a visually and dramatically schematic film is punctuated by the image of fire, real and imagined. Dad is still at work and white-hot rivets are hammered into ships in a dry dock. Little Liam is being prepared for his first communion and his first confession at a primitive parochial school where a female teacher and a bullying priest drill into him the fear of hellfire. Just before a copy of the Liverpool Post goes up in flames while drawing a morning fire, we read headlines of dole queues and Ramsay MacDonald's coalition government. Liam sees hell in the road-menders' brazier and the blacksmith's furnace and, in the climactic scene, by a terrible, melodramatic irony, a human being is turned into a blazing torch. Dad is soon laid off, becomes obsessed with scabs and cheap labour from Ireland and rants against Jewish exploiters. Liam is tortured by an induced sense of sin (seeing his mother naked is a traumatic experience), feels guilty about the suffering around him and his already chronic stammer, one of the most convincing I have ever seen or heard in a film, becomes paralytic. His 14-year-old sister, Theresa (Megan Burns), goes into service with a well-off Jewish family, who own the dock where Dad worked, and she finds herself carrying messages between her employer's wife and her young lover. Liam's mother (Claire Hackett), a devout Catholic, desperately tries to hold the family together. But finally she turns on her husband when he goes berserk and denounces the church's venality during Liam's first communion and then becomes a militant member of Oswald Mosley's Blackshirts. Like his communist opposite number in Land and Freedom, he ends up crushed and disillusioned. This is heady, uncompromising stuff that hits you at gut level, often below the belt in the way McGovern's Priest did. The performances have a raw humanity that makes us feel sympathy for Dad, even when he goes beyond the pale. But the subjective viewpoints, whether Liam's, Theresa's or Dad's, make it impossible to view this narrowly conceived section of society with anything approaching objectivity. I'm also more than a trifle uneasy about the way the perceived exploiters - the dock owner, the pawnbroker, the rent collector - are all Jews. I'm also not convinced that a Blackshirt speaker would attack the Irish; from the start, the Mosleyites attracted a lot of support from anti-communist Catholics and stood behind Franco in 1936. It is, however, a powerful movie about divisive issues that were kept from our screens at the time by the British Board of Film Censors. The most hard-hitting play of the decade, Love on the Dole, couldn't be filmed until 1941, by which time it was history. Liam touched on deep, personal feelings for me. I grew up on Merseyside in the 1930s and 40s, all the members of my father's family worked in the docks or went to sea, and as Protestants they never spoke to their slightly better-off Catholic relatives. Anti-Semitism was rife among my parents' friends and at my school, and I recall that when at the 1945 general election the Labour Party put up a Jewish lawyer (a KC called Voss) against the incumbent Tory, Sir Malcolm Bullock, in Crosby, a local councillor said at a public meeting: 'I think I can rely upon you all to vote Conservative, but anyway I cannot believe you would vote for a Jew.' At that time, I had a chronic, almost disabling stammer, like Liam's. But in 1948, when I moved to Bristol with my parents, I had Jewish schoolfriends for the first time, I began to read Catholic writers and in this fresh, new air my stammer began steadily to abate, though it was never to disappear.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Norman Wisdom looks back on his long lap of honour as a British comedian, he likes to tell a story about his vaudeville beginnings. In 1940, aged 25 and enlisted in the Royal Corps of Signals as a musician, he stepped down from the orchestra pit at their base in Cheltenham and started to shadow-box during the middle of a dance routine. Forever inching his way towards the centre of everybody's attentions, Wisdom heard his colleagues' giggles and promptly added a duck-waddle to his routine. He then burst into a variety of facial expressions. 'They were in hysterics,' he says. 'All the officers were falling about laughing.' It was here, on this night, that Wisdom patented his persona as 'The Successful Failure'. Over the next few years, until he was de-mobbed in 1945, his routine would be suffixed with his characteristic singing and the trip-up-and-stumble. </p> <p>Wisdom, now 86 and still armed with that 100-watt maniacal grin, is nearly as old as the last century. Yet his lifelong obsession with fame and his legacy belongs to the modern era. </p> <p>He was born in Marylebone, London; his mother a dressmaker and his father a chauffeur. By the time he was nine, his parents had split. His mother left home and the two Wisdom offspring were left to fend for themselves - often for weeks at a time. </p> <p>'We used to go down the Harrow Road,' recalls Wisdom. 'There, you'd find all these food shops that had open fronts. And we'd steal the food to eat: grab a bun here, some eggs there. I used to find it funny at the time: nowadays it just reduces me to tears.' As if to demonstrate, he shudders and starts to sob. </p> <p>Wisdom left school at the age of 14: there followed spells as a delivery boy, a commis-waiter and cabin boy. He would eventually try out as a boy-bandsman in the King George's Military Bandsmen. 'The bandmaster asked me if I knew what a musical \"flat\" was,' he says. 'I said I didn't. Then he asked me if I knew what a musical \"sharp\" was. Again, I replied that I didn't. \"Boy,\" he boomed, \"you will never be a musician.\" At that point I started to cry,' remembers Wisdom. 'And he was so moved he eventually let me in.' </p> <p>But it was signing up with the Signals at the age of 25 that gave Wisdom his break in the entertainment industry. 'That night, when I shadow-boxed and pulled all those funny faces,' he says, 'that's when I finally realised I wanted to be an entertainer.' </p> <p>During the 40s and early 50s, Wisdom continued to garner himself a reputation as a jobbing comedian - he was variously signed to theatres in London and Brighton. 'I spent virtually all of those years on the road,' he says now. 'You could keep incredibly busy just performing in pantomimes and revues. There was a whole generation of performers who learned everything on the stage.' </p> <p>But in 1951, the comedian who had come to embody the small-town, unsophisticated British misfit signed to the powerful Rank film organisation. Released in 1953, Trouble in Store was to hallmark - and perhaps caricature - his contribution to cinema. With its base-level jokes - Wisdom scoops ice cream from a co-star's cleavage - Trouble in Store differed from the Carry On capers by identifying Wisdom with his target audience. In the cast list his character, as it is in many of his films, is referred to only as 'Norman'. </p> <p>Viewed today, Wisdom's films - 'I did 19 of 'em; make sure you say that,' he says proudly - offer a timepiece of post-war Britain. Whether he was playing 'Norman Puckle', 'Norman Pitkin', or just plain 'Norman', his films, while raising laughs with audiences at the time, almost always failed to raise ideas. Yet they were extraordinarily successful - providing the first tentative steps into cinema for a generation of variety performers. Wisdom's brand of comedy, essentially a re-run of Tom and Jerry cartoons, would go from commercial strength to commercial strength. </p> <p> These days, Wisdom splits his time between a spacious flat in Epsom, Surrey, on the top floor of a residential block, and an elaborately furnished Spanish-style house on the Isle of Man which also serves as home. At Epsom, a Union Jack stands on a chest of drawers in his bedroom. A cloth-doll likeness of Wisdom, donated by a fan, lies on top of a display case in his living room. 'I sometimes look through my old file,' he says. 'I have a folder where I keep all the articles the critics have written about me. It makes me feel good. Mostly I work on my play and write new songs.' The comedian hopes to make one last film - an adaptation of a JB Priestley play, Adam and Evil. </p> <p>'People will always find the sight of someone falling or someone spilling something funny,' says Wisdom, a little defensively, of his comic legacy. 'I've not seen Lee Evans yet, but people say he's a bit like me. Physical comedy will never be as popular as it was: comedians just don't get that kind of training these days. All the cabaret clubs have gone.' </p> <p>His flat in Epsom is full of organised clutter - neatly folded newspapers lie positioned on a shelf beneath his coffee table. A bowlful of plastic fruit occupies a central position on the table, two coasters situated equidistantly on either side. 'My only phobia is untidiness,' he says. 'My hair has to be neatly kept, my shoes are always clean.' He glances over at my dusty work boots. 'Everything has to be in a straight line, in its place.' </p> <p>'So, would this bother you?' I venture, dragging one of the coasters from its site. Wisdom giggles, watching me push the coaster back. 'After you've gone,' he admits, 'I'll move that back to exactly where it was.' </p> <p>Wisdom received almost 400 cards last Christmas. 'It's a full-time job opening his post,' says Sylvia Murray, his recently hired live-in personal assistant. Her predecessor, Ann Axe, retired at the end of 2000 after six years of service. 'I traded her in for a newer model,' laughs the comedian. At dinnertime, Sylvia cooks for Wisdom - he calls it 'army food' - and the duo sit by the antique television. 'I like a bit of company,' he says. </p> <p>According to Sylvia, 'The cards come from all over the world. We got one simply addressed, \"To The Funniest Man Alive, The Isle of Man\". Another one was posted to \"The Greatest Comedian Ever, Norman Wisdom\". They all seem to find their way to him. He reads them all, although it does take him a little time. I think he'd like to keep them all, but there would be no room for anything else if he did.' </p> <p>It is hard to imagine now just how successful Wisdom was at his height. </p> <p> In the mid-60s, the name 'Norman Wisdom' had become a worldwide brand. His audience extended to Southeast Asia, Europe, South America and the communist countries of Russia, Albania and China (and this at the height of the Cold War). While holidaying in Moscow in 1963, Wisdom was mobbed by locals shouting for their 'Mr Pitkin'. At the Moscow Sports Palace, Wisdom attended the film gala of A Stitch in Time in July 1965. Screened to an audience of 10,000, the comedian offered a spontaneous demonstration of his unstructured skills. His impish humour perfectly translated across cultures. Eight years later, he would schedule a one-month tour of China - at the personal invitation of Mao Tse Tung. </p> <p>His popularity abroad continued unabated. In 1995, Wisdom travelled to post-communist Albania as the invited guest of President Sali Berisha. There, the comedian was honoured with a key to the state capital, Tirana, and a 90-minute appearance on television. (During the rule of dictator Enver Hoxha, Albanians were only ever permitted nationally produced programmes, and Wisdom's comedies were the only Western movies to escape state censors.) He even opened the 'Pitkini' orphanage. </p> <p>But success in America proved more difficult. His first cinematic release in the US, the 1953 comedy Trouble in Store, attracted derisive comments. Critic Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, said: 'Wisdom would be honoured for holding the third Ritz Brother's coat. To put him in a class with Lou Costello would be to flatter him recklessly. To mention his name with Red Skelton's would be to libel the latter... Perhaps his miserable showing in this picture is not all his fault... in a film which, by Hollywood standards, would not do credit to Poverty Row. Heaven help the British, if Mr Wisdom is really their boy.' </p> <p>'I can't remember that particular review,' says Wisdom now. 'But certainly my films had a problem getting into America. I wasn't heavily promoted over there. And, even in the 50s, Hollywood had a very aggressive marketing machine. Remember, most of my comedies were low on budgets - certainly by American standards.' </p> <p>But if his critics mocked his contribution to cinema as that of a trench-time, music-hall nomad, the comedian would eventually force a reappraisal of his career. Wisdom moved to New York in 1964 for a string of Broadway musicals. His first American film vehicle was in 1968 with The Night They Raided Minsky's, which provided the British comedian with a stab at American credibility. The film, directed by William Friedkin, was a charismatic account of the rise of New York's Lower East Side strip clubs. (Three years later, Friedkin would direct Gene Hackman to great acclaim in the meticulous thriller The French Connection.) </p> <p> The Night They Raided Minsky's chronicles the last 24 hours of a burlesque before vice squads raid the club. This nostalgic period piece - editing together black-and-white and colour footage - provided Wisdom with his most accomplished cinematic role as the permanently sad-eyed vaudeville performer Chick Williams. And accompanied by an ensemble cast - Elliot Gould, Jason Robards and Denholm Elliott, Britt Ekland - it received delirious reviews in the US. </p> <p>Wisdom, in particular, was praised for his rough-and-tumble performance, and even awarded an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Variety wrote: 'So easily does Wisdom dominate his many scenes, other cast members suffer by comparison.' And Time was stirred enough to compare him to America's comedic Old Guard: 'Wisdom recalls Keaton in his split-second spills and deadpan pantomime.' </p> <p>'I wish I had done more straight roles,' Wisdom tells me, thoughtfully. ' The Night They Raided Minsky's was probably my first attempt at a comic but slightly serious role. Don't get me wrong: I'm overjoyed with my career to date. But perhaps I could have done more. Mostly, I just did whatever the directors told me to do.' </p> <p>The comedian would eventually resist the temptation to relocate permanently to the US and return to Britain in 1968. 'I thought about it,' he says. 'I've travelled all over the world, to many wonderful countries. But England always calls me back.' After returning to Britain, with his film career as the coward's coward diminishing, the comedian settled into administrating to his financial investments. His financial security had been assured since the 50s: Wisdom co-owned a brickworks and a transport company in Coventry. He would sell off his interests in both companies in 1972. 'The trouble was that though my partner knew about bricks, we were in the business at the wrong time,' he joked then. 'The only people who seemed to want bricks were agitators - for throwing at embassies.' </p> <p>In another venture, Wisdom was appointed director of his local football club, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, then in the fourth division. He would record them a lyrically forgettable terrace chant to the tune of 'Sussex By The Sea'. </p> <p>His most lucrative investment, however, was his Spanish-built yacht Conquest, purchased for \u00a380,000 in 1963, and left at Shoreham for refitting. After three years of extensive trials and tests, refurbishing and repainting, the 92ft yacht's value soared to \u00a31.25m - Conquest was available to hire for \u00a36,000 a month. 'It was nice, but I got rid of it,' he says. 'I'm no sailor.' </p> <p>As his London 'office', Wisdom retained a three-bedroom flat in Kensington, fabricated to resemble a Spanish town house. One business venture made the headlines in 1968. Wisdom went to court to appeal against the Inland Revenue's claim on \u00a348,000 profit collected from a silver bullion deal. The judge ruled that the comedian had invested money in silver in 1962 as a 'hedge' against possible devaluation. Said Wisdom, after the ruling, 'It's only right, under the taxation system, that the more you earn, the more tax you should pay. That's fair. I'd rather lose a few quid than tell a flat joke.' </p> <p>But while Wisdom ably tackled his financial commitments throughout the late 60s, his marriage deteriorated. In 1969, he petitioned his wife, Freda, for an uncontested divorce, after 22 years of marriage. 'She galloped off with someone tall, dark and handsome,' he says. The sentence is a recurrent remark in his analysis of their divorce; he has almost always viewed the end of his marriage with a self-deprecating put-down. After a short custody battle, the comedian was granted charge of both their teenage children. Wisdom would never marry again. </p> <p>'I've lady-friends,' he says now, easing himself up in his seat. 'I have certainly had intimate relationships with women over the years. Y'know, I have dated. But I never remarried. I guess there was an element of trust to it: perhaps I stopped trusting women. After a while, you realise that not all women are like that. Some are trustworthy; others aren't.' </p> <p>As a synaptic response to his divorce, Wisdom plunged himself back into cabaret: The Royal Variety Show and The London Palladium Show provided a highly lucrative sphere of entertainment, then backed by ter- restrial television. Morecambe and Wise once referred to their own Variety Show appearances as 'bank raids'. And Wisdom himself travelled extensively throughout the 70s, taking his summer show overseas to Iran, Canada, Tasmania, New Zealand, Hong King, Malaysia and Australia. His partner at the time was Tony Fayne, a London Palladium veteran who, in 1951, supported Judy Garland in her London debut. Always part of a double act, Fayne went solo in 1959 - eventually performing on The Ed Sullivan Show. The Wisdom-Fayne partnership lasted 40 years, until the latter's retirement two years ago. </p> <p>'Norman certainly threw himself back into cabaret after his divorce,' remembers Fayne, now 77. 'Not that he ever talked about it: I've known him for 40 years, and he has never mentioned his personal life. Never. Is he hardworking? Well, yes. But that masks an insecurity. He has a terrible memory: he has to learn everything parrot fashion. He's terrified of failure. So he's a bit like Jack Nicklaus - he'll hit 60 balls and if the 59th one is hit wrong, he'll go back and do the whole thing over again. Norman's a bit like that... he doesn't have many friends.' </p> <p>Family relations equally remember a purist with an almost royal faith in keeping a schedule busy with personal appearances: charity work, cabaret and television. 'I've always considered my father a perfectionist,' says Nick Wisdom, the comedian's son. 'I can always remember him as someone extremely busy.' </p> <p>Now 48, Nick Wisdom runs a sports shop in West Sussex, but in his short-lived film career as a child actor he can be seen playing the piano in Wisdom Snr's 1959 feature Follow a Star. 'That was a one-off,' he laughs. 'I never really wanted to be an actor. I was more interested in being a cricketer.' Their relationship was not close: 'I didn't really get to know my father until I was an adult. He was always away - either performing or filming. And everyone knows that the entertainment industry doesn't obey nine-to-five rules.' And when his father was home, remembers Nick Wisdom, 'he was mostly rehearsing his routines. He would go over and over those complicated dance steps until they were perfect in their delivery. He would practise all night if necessary.' </p> <p>He pauses meditatively, perhaps computing the cost of those paternal absences. 'I think the fact that he has worked so hard at it has ensured his survival in the industry,' he says, finally. </p> <p> As Wisdom has increasingly retired from public, the octogenarian has sought to vent his playful humour even through his languid state of domesticity. 'He's hard work,' Ann Axe told me shortly before her retirement last year. 'He's always falling down, trying to give me a heart attack. There are other days when he's trying to trip me up. Norman? He's a little devil.' </p> <p>Wisdom has now similarly recalibrated the focus of his pranks to sometimes infuriate Sylvia. As she sits waiting for him to dictate phone numbers of friends, he speeds through the 11-digit patterns at random. 'You've given me Nick's number as Tony's,' she pronounces, tapping her pen on her notepad, looking at me and rolling her eyes. 'And this other number is wrong as well.' </p> <p>The comedian, lounging back into his armchair, gives me a wily grin, and winks.

      "bodyText": "When Norman Wisdom looks back on his long lap of honour as a British comedian, he likes to tell a story about his vaudeville beginnings. In 1940, aged 25 and enlisted in the Royal Corps of Signals as a musician, he stepped down from the orchestra pit at their base in Cheltenham and started to shadow-box during the middle of a dance routine. Forever inching his way towards the centre of everybody's attentions, Wisdom heard his colleagues' giggles and promptly added a duck-waddle to his routine. He then burst into a variety of facial expressions. 'They were in hysterics,' he says. 'All the officers were falling about laughing.' It was here, on this night, that Wisdom patented his persona as 'The Successful Failure'. Over the next few years, until he was de-mobbed in 1945, his routine would be suffixed with his characteristic singing and the trip-up-and-stumble. Wisdom, now 86 and still armed with that 100-watt maniacal grin, is nearly as old as the last century. Yet his lifelong obsession with fame and his legacy belongs to the modern era. He was born in Marylebone, London; his mother a dressmaker and his father a chauffeur. By the time he was nine, his parents had split. His mother left home and the two Wisdom offspring were left to fend for themselves - often for weeks at a time. 'We used to go down the Harrow Road,' recalls Wisdom. 'There, you'd find all these food shops that had open fronts. And we'd steal the food to eat: grab a bun here, some eggs there. I used to find it funny at the time: nowadays it just reduces me to tears.' As if to demonstrate, he shudders and starts to sob. Wisdom left school at the age of 14: there followed spells as a delivery boy, a commis-waiter and cabin boy. He would eventually try out as a boy-bandsman in the King George's Military Bandsmen. 'The bandmaster asked me if I knew what a musical \"flat\" was,' he says. 'I said I didn't. Then he asked me if I knew what a musical \"sharp\" was. Again, I replied that I didn't. \"Boy,\" he boomed, \"you will never be a musician.\" At that point I started to cry,' remembers Wisdom. 'And he was so moved he eventually let me in.' But it was signing up with the Signals at the age of 25 that gave Wisdom his break in the entertainment industry. 'That night, when I shadow-boxed and pulled all those funny faces,' he says, 'that's when I finally realised I wanted to be an entertainer.' During the 40s and early 50s, Wisdom continued to garner himself a reputation as a jobbing comedian - he was variously signed to theatres in London and Brighton. 'I spent virtually all of those years on the road,' he says now. 'You could keep incredibly busy just performing in pantomimes and revues. There was a whole generation of performers who learned everything on the stage.' But in 1951, the comedian who had come to embody the small-town, unsophisticated British misfit signed to the powerful Rank film organisation. Released in 1953, Trouble in Store was to hallmark - and perhaps caricature - his contribution to cinema. With its base-level jokes - Wisdom scoops ice cream from a co-star's cleavage - Trouble in Store differed from the Carry On capers by identifying Wisdom with his target audience. In the cast list his character, as it is in many of his films, is referred to only as 'Norman'. Viewed today, Wisdom's films - 'I did 19 of 'em; make sure you say that,' he says proudly - offer a timepiece of post-war Britain. Whether he was playing 'Norman Puckle', 'Norman Pitkin', or just plain 'Norman', his films, while raising laughs with audiences at the time, almost always failed to raise ideas. Yet they were extraordinarily successful - providing the first tentative steps into cinema for a generation of variety performers. Wisdom's brand of comedy, essentially a re-run of Tom and Jerry cartoons, would go from commercial strength to commercial strength. These days, Wisdom splits his time between a spacious flat in Epsom, Surrey, on the top floor of a residential block, and an elaborately furnished Spanish-style house on the Isle of Man which also serves as home. At Epsom, a Union Jack stands on a chest of drawers in his bedroom. A cloth-doll likeness of Wisdom, donated by a fan, lies on top of a display case in his living room. 'I sometimes look through my old file,' he says. 'I have a folder where I keep all the articles the critics have written about me. It makes me feel good. Mostly I work on my play and write new songs.' The comedian hopes to make one last film - an adaptation of a JB Priestley play, Adam and Evil. 'People will always find the sight of someone falling or someone spilling something funny,' says Wisdom, a little defensively, of his comic legacy. 'I've not seen Lee Evans yet, but people say he's a bit like me. Physical comedy will never be as popular as it was: comedians just don't get that kind of training these days. All the cabaret clubs have gone.' His flat in Epsom is full of organised clutter - neatly folded newspapers lie positioned on a shelf beneath his coffee table. A bowlful of plastic fruit occupies a central position on the table, two coasters situated equidistantly on either side. 'My only phobia is untidiness,' he says. 'My hair has to be neatly kept, my shoes are always clean.' He glances over at my dusty work boots. 'Everything has to be in a straight line, in its place.' 'So, would this bother you?' I venture, dragging one of the coasters from its site. Wisdom giggles, watching me push the coaster back. 'After you've gone,' he admits, 'I'll move that back to exactly where it was.' Wisdom received almost 400 cards last Christmas. 'It's a full-time job opening his post,' says Sylvia Murray, his recently hired live-in personal assistant. Her predecessor, Ann Axe, retired at the end of 2000 after six years of service. 'I traded her in for a newer model,' laughs the comedian. At dinnertime, Sylvia cooks for Wisdom - he calls it 'army food' - and the duo sit by the antique television. 'I like a bit of company,' he says. According to Sylvia, 'The cards come from all over the world. We got one simply addressed, \"To The Funniest Man Alive, The Isle of Man\". Another one was posted to \"The Greatest Comedian Ever, Norman Wisdom\". They all seem to find their way to him. He reads them all, although it does take him a little time. I think he'd like to keep them all, but there would be no room for anything else if he did.' It is hard to imagine now just how successful Wisdom was at his height. In the mid-60s, the name 'Norman Wisdom' had become a worldwide brand. His audience extended to Southeast Asia, Europe, South America and the communist countries of Russia, Albania and China (and this at the height of the Cold War). While holidaying in Moscow in 1963, Wisdom was mobbed by locals shouting for their 'Mr Pitkin'. At the Moscow Sports Palace, Wisdom attended the film gala of A Stitch in Time in July 1965. Screened to an audience of 10,000, the comedian offered a spontaneous demonstration of his unstructured skills. His impish humour perfectly translated across cultures. Eight years later, he would schedule a one-month tour of China - at the personal invitation of Mao Tse Tung. His popularity abroad continued unabated. In 1995, Wisdom travelled to post-communist Albania as the invited guest of President Sali Berisha. There, the comedian was honoured with a key to the state capital, Tirana, and a 90-minute appearance on television. (During the rule of dictator Enver Hoxha, Albanians were only ever permitted nationally produced programmes, and Wisdom's comedies were the only Western movies to escape state censors.) He even opened the 'Pitkini' orphanage. But success in America proved more difficult. His first cinematic release in the US, the 1953 comedy Trouble in Store, attracted derisive comments. Critic Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, said: 'Wisdom would be honoured for holding the third Ritz Brother's coat. To put him in a class with Lou Costello would be to flatter him recklessly. To mention his name with Red Skelton's would be to libel the latter... Perhaps his miserable showing in this picture is not all his fault... in a film which, by Hollywood standards, would not do credit to Poverty Row. Heaven help the British, if Mr Wisdom is really their boy.' 'I can't remember that particular review,' says Wisdom now. 'But certainly my films had a problem getting into America. I wasn't heavily promoted over there. And, even in the 50s, Hollywood had a very aggressive marketing machine. Remember, most of my comedies were low on budgets - certainly by American standards.' But if his critics mocked his contribution to cinema as that of a trench-time, music-hall nomad, the comedian would eventually force a reappraisal of his career. Wisdom moved to New York in 1964 for a string of Broadway musicals. His first American film vehicle was in 1968 with The Night They Raided Minsky's, which provided the British comedian with a stab at American credibility. The film, directed by William Friedkin, was a charismatic account of the rise of New York's Lower East Side strip clubs. (Three years later, Friedkin would direct Gene Hackman to great acclaim in the meticulous thriller The French Connection.) The Night They Raided Minsky's chronicles the last 24 hours of a burlesque before vice squads raid the club. This nostalgic period piece - editing together black-and-white and colour footage - provided Wisdom with his most accomplished cinematic role as the permanently sad-eyed vaudeville performer Chick Williams. And accompanied by an ensemble cast - Elliot Gould, Jason Robards and Denholm Elliott, Britt Ekland - it received delirious reviews in the US. Wisdom, in particular, was praised for his rough-and-tumble performance, and even awarded an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Variety wrote: 'So easily does Wisdom dominate his many scenes, other cast members suffer by comparison.' And Time was stirred enough to compare him to America's comedic Old Guard: 'Wisdom recalls Keaton in his split-second spills and deadpan pantomime.' 'I wish I had done more straight roles,' Wisdom tells me, thoughtfully. ' The Night They Raided Minsky's was probably my first attempt at a comic but slightly serious role. Don't get me wrong: I'm overjoyed with my career to date. But perhaps I could have done more. Mostly, I just did whatever the directors told me to do.' The comedian would eventually resist the temptation to relocate permanently to the US and return to Britain in 1968. 'I thought about it,' he says. 'I've travelled all over the world, to many wonderful countries. But England always calls me back.' After returning to Britain, with his film career as the coward's coward diminishing, the comedian settled into administrating to his financial investments. His financial security had been assured since the 50s: Wisdom co-owned a brickworks and a transport company in Coventry. He would sell off his interests in both companies in 1972. 'The trouble was that though my partner knew about bricks, we were in the business at the wrong time,' he joked then. 'The only people who seemed to want bricks were agitators - for throwing at embassies.' In another venture, Wisdom was appointed director of his local football club, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, then in the fourth division. He would record them a lyrically forgettable terrace chant to the tune of 'Sussex By The Sea'. His most lucrative investment, however, was his Spanish-built yacht Conquest, purchased for \u00a380,000 in 1963, and left at Shoreham for refitting. After three years of extensive trials and tests, refurbishing and repainting, the 92ft yacht's value soared to \u00a31.25m - Conquest was available to hire for \u00a36,000 a month. 'It was nice, but I got rid of it,' he says. 'I'm no sailor.' As his London 'office', Wisdom retained a three-bedroom flat in Kensington, fabricated to resemble a Spanish town house. One business venture made the headlines in 1968. Wisdom went to court to appeal against the Inland Revenue's claim on \u00a348,000 profit collected from a silver bullion deal. The judge ruled that the comedian had invested money in silver in 1962 as a 'hedge' against possible devaluation. Said Wisdom, after the ruling, 'It's only right, under the taxation system, that the more you earn, the more tax you should pay. That's fair. I'd rather lose a few quid than tell a flat joke.' But while Wisdom ably tackled his financial commitments throughout the late 60s, his marriage deteriorated. In 1969, he petitioned his wife, Freda, for an uncontested divorce, after 22 years of marriage. 'She galloped off with someone tall, dark and handsome,' he says. The sentence is a recurrent remark in his analysis of their divorce; he has almost always viewed the end of his marriage with a self-deprecating put-down. After a short custody battle, the comedian was granted charge of both their teenage children. Wisdom would never marry again. 'I've lady-friends,' he says now, easing himself up in his seat. 'I have certainly had intimate relationships with women over the years. Y'know, I have dated. But I never remarried. I guess there was an element of trust to it: perhaps I stopped trusting women. After a while, you realise that not all women are like that. Some are trustworthy; others aren't.' As a synaptic response to his divorce, Wisdom plunged himself back into cabaret: The Royal Variety Show and The London Palladium Show provided a highly lucrative sphere of entertainment, then backed by ter- restrial television. Morecambe and Wise once referred to their own Variety Show appearances as 'bank raids'. And Wisdom himself travelled extensively throughout the 70s, taking his summer show overseas to Iran, Canada, Tasmania, New Zealand, Hong King, Malaysia and Australia. His partner at the time was Tony Fayne, a London Palladium veteran who, in 1951, supported Judy Garland in her London debut. Always part of a double act, Fayne went solo in 1959 - eventually performing on The Ed Sullivan Show. The Wisdom-Fayne partnership lasted 40 years, until the latter's retirement two years ago. 'Norman certainly threw himself back into cabaret after his divorce,' remembers Fayne, now 77. 'Not that he ever talked about it: I've known him for 40 years, and he has never mentioned his personal life. Never. Is he hardworking? Well, yes. But that masks an insecurity. He has a terrible memory: he has to learn everything parrot fashion. He's terrified of failure. So he's a bit like Jack Nicklaus - he'll hit 60 balls and if the 59th one is hit wrong, he'll go back and do the whole thing over again. Norman's a bit like that... he doesn't have many friends.' Family relations equally remember a purist with an almost royal faith in keeping a schedule busy with personal appearances: charity work, cabaret and television. 'I've always considered my father a perfectionist,' says Nick Wisdom, the comedian's son. 'I can always remember him as someone extremely busy.' Now 48, Nick Wisdom runs a sports shop in West Sussex, but in his short-lived film career as a child actor he can be seen playing the piano in Wisdom Snr's 1959 feature Follow a Star. 'That was a one-off,' he laughs. 'I never really wanted to be an actor. I was more interested in being a cricketer.' Their relationship was not close: 'I didn't really get to know my father until I was an adult. He was always away - either performing or filming. And everyone knows that the entertainment industry doesn't obey nine-to-five rules.' And when his father was home, remembers Nick Wisdom, 'he was mostly rehearsing his routines. He would go over and over those complicated dance steps until they were perfect in their delivery. He would practise all night if necessary.' He pauses meditatively, perhaps computing the cost of those paternal absences. 'I think the fact that he has worked so hard at it has ensured his survival in the industry,' he says, finally. As Wisdom has increasingly retired from public, the octogenarian has sought to vent his playful humour even through his languid state of domesticity. 'He's hard work,' Ann Axe told me shortly before her retirement last year. 'He's always falling down, trying to give me a heart attack. There are other days when he's trying to trip me up. Norman? He's a little devil.' Wisdom has now similarly recalibrated the focus of his pranks to sometimes infuriate Sylvia. As she sits waiting for him to dictate phone numbers of friends, he speeds through the 11-digit patterns at random. 'You've given me Nick's number as Tony's,' she pronounces, tapping her pen on her notepad, looking at me and rolling her eyes. 'And this other number is wrong as well.' The comedian, lounging back into his armchair, gives me a wily grin, and winks. 'I've still got it,' he insists, reeling off the correct contact details. 'Look,' he says, rolling over both sets of pupils until they disappear behind foggy white eyeballs. 'I'm not mental yet.'",

Fewer than a quarter of the 70,000 chemicals used in toiletries and cleaning products have been subjected to a full safety investigation, while others, officially classed as hazardous waste, are frequently found in products from baby lotion to eye drops and cleaning fluids, according to Pat Thomas, author of Cleaning Yourself to Death . Women who work at home have a 55 per cent higher death rate from cancer than those who work outside the home, a statistic that Thomas argues is closely related to the increase in household cleaning products and toiletries. 'We spend 90 per cent of our time at home but some of the most toxic chemicals we come into contact with are not blown in through the window from some anonymous factory or a passing car,' she said. 'They are bought in good faith in stores and supermarkets and brought back into our homes by us, in the form of every day cleaning products.' Thomas believes that the lack of legislation has meant that chemicals banned in other, more tightly controlled areas are still commonly used in thousands of household products. She believes this contributes heavily to the US Environmental Protection Agency's recent finding that the air quality in homes is more toxic than the outdoor air, often containing between two and five times the concentration of toxic chemicals. 'Most people cross their fingers and pray that the companies who put these chemical soups together really do have the consumer's welfare and best interests at heart, but the emerging evidence is that many of these chemicals have the potential to make us and our children very ill indeed,' she said. Although no national research has been carried out in Britain, a survey by the the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health in America found that of 2,983 chemicals found in personal care products, more than 30 per cent were toxic. According to Thomas, toiletries and cleaning products regularly include ingredients which contain carcinogens, hormone-disrupting chemicals and central nervous system disrupters. 'This has remained hidden because people assume that if we're living longer, we must be healthier,' said Thomas.

He was in danger of not only losing middle England, but his core vote as well. He even thought that going to Notting Hill Carnival had backfired. It was a very black time.' The source said that, far from having a personality which is unaffected by the poor performance of the party, Hague was wracked by indecision about whether he could save the Tories from political oblivion. He thought that standing for re-election as leader could strengthen his position if things became untenable, as John Major had done in his famous 'put-up or shut-up' demand to the party during the last government when he was Prime Minister. Last week a poll in The Times found the Tories were as far behind Labour as they were three months before the last general election. It was reported that allies of Michael Portillo were massing in case Hague's performance in the next election is as bad as many of his supporters fear. Hague confided his thinking in December 1999 to three lieutenants - Amanda Platell, his press secretary, Sebastian Coe, his private secretary, and Nicholas Gleave, his closest political friend. He then went on holiday with his wife, Ffion, to discuss his future. The source said that Platell, Coe and Gleave went into 'mobile mode', constantly telephoning each other to put in place a strategy to save the Tory leader. Hague told friends he had found the previous few months almost impossible to endure. Poll ratings were not moving and he was getting negative messages about attempts to move to the middle ground. Previous months had seen a row over donations to the party by businessman Michael Ashcroft, the defection to Labour of Tory MP Sean Woodward and the success of Portillo, Hague's arch rival, in becoming candidate for the safe Tory seat of Kensington and Chelsea. The source said Hague decided he would continue the fight because there was no one else to take over his mantle. He began by sacking Portillo allies in the Shadow Cabinet, as well as John Redwood.",

But Byamungu tenses up when he tells how the prostitute laughed at him before he shot her - and you sense he is telling the truth. Byamungu says he is 13, though he looks barely 10.</p> <p>Most of the armies at war in the Democratic Republic of Congo rely on children like Byamungu. They learned the trick from former president Laurent Kabila. His kidogos - little ones - were his most loyal fighters, he boasted, until one of them assassinated him last month.</p> <p>Byamungu was pressed into Kabila's army aged 10. Six months later he was captured by the main rebel army, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), and for three years fought with them.</p> <p>With his piping voice, Byamungu might seem like a little boy playing the man. But he is not play-acting. 'Of course I killed men,' he says, craning his neck horribly to avoid eye contact. 'It's very difficult to fight and not kill, and I fought many times.'</p> <p>Byamungu is in a child demobilisation centre run by Save the Children on the edge of Bukavu, in the east of the country. In a concrete yard surrounded by concrete stalls 50 children - technically, under-18s - are waiting while their families are traced.</p> <p>Deo Buuma, Save the Children's Bukavu office manager, apologises that the centre looks like a farmyard. 'At first we had them in a house in town, but the kids kept trying to rob people and rape girls in the street,' he explained.</p> <p>Over the past year and a half, 344 children have been demobilised in Bukavu. The rate is accelerating rapidly - 44 have come this month. Most are from the RCD, which commands Bukavu and the surrounding towns, and a few are from the Mai Mai, a nationalist militia hiding out in the dense forests.</p> <p>Valery Manegabe, Save the Children's demobilisation officer, says RCD comman ders are becoming 'quite helpful', but adds: 'With the Mai Mai it's more difficult because more than half of them are children - maybe 10,000 in all. They say we're just trying to reduce their strength.'</p> <p>The RCD provincial president, Norbert Basengezi Katintima, says it is delighted to co-operate but it is thought it still holds around 1,000 children. Part of the problem is that the rebel army, widely considered a front for neighbouring Rwanda's occupation of the eastern part of the Democratic Republic, has a shaky chain of command.</p> <p>'There is no respect for orders from top to bottom,' Manegabe said. 'Even if the brigade commander authorises the release of some children, their officer-in-charge can refuse to give them to us.'</p> <p>More fundamentally, child soldiers are highly prized. 'An officer told me that children are more obedient and less afraid than adults, so they use them on the front line,' said Manegabe. 'And of course they don't complain as much when they aren't paid.'</p> <p>The Mai Mai are even more committed to youth. They claim to possess a charm which makes warriors invincible, provided its conditions are stringently observed.</p> <p>'Even though the children have the magic, we shouldn't ignore the fact that they are still underage soldiers,' said Manegabe. Like all Save the Children's staff in Bukavu, he is convinced of the charm's efficacy. Little Byamungu is more sceptical: 'There is no medicine against a bullet. Whenever we shot Mai Mai, they died.'</p> <p>It is one thing to pull children out of the army, quite another to keep them out. Many join up to escape the poverty of a country ravaged by war: at least four boys have passed through the demob centre twice.</p> <p>'The only people guaranteed not to starve in Congo are those with guns,' said Claude Jibidar, UN co-ordinator for the province. More than 70 per cent of eastern Congo's schools have been closed by the war.</p> <p>Charlotte Ernique has a new dress from Save the Children and a head newly shaved by the RCD. She is 15 but, like virtually all the children at the demob centre, years of malnutrition have made her look much younger. Last month Charlotte gave up prostitution and joined the RCD because she was scared of getting Aids. She says she cannot go back to her village because she was forced to leave when a neighbour accused her of witchcraft.</p> <p>'And anyway my parents had no food for me. The army was a hard life because I was beaten,' she said. 'But I did not ask to leave. If not prostitution, what am I to do? I will have to go into the army again.'</p> <p>The UN has failed miserably to address the root cause of the use of children as soldiers: the war. A year after they were promised, almost no UN military observers have been deployed. 'We cannot hope for everybody to suddenly wake up and stop the war. But we must at least pull the children out,' said Jibidar.</p>",

Most are from the RCD, which commands Bukavu and the surrounding towns, and a few are from the Mai Mai, a nationalist militia hiding out in the dense forests. Valery Manegabe, Save the Children's demobilisation officer, says RCD comman ders are becoming 'quite helpful', but adds: 'With the Mai Mai it's more difficult because more than half of them are children - maybe 10,000 in all. They say we're just trying to reduce their strength.' The RCD provincial president, Norbert Basengezi Katintima, says it is delighted to co-operate but it is thought it still holds around 1,000 children. Part of the problem is that the rebel army, widely considered a front for neighbouring Rwanda's occupation of the eastern part of the Democratic Republic, has a shaky chain of command. 'There is no respect for orders from top to bottom,' Manegabe said. 'Even if the brigade commander authorises the release of some children, their officer-in-charge can refuse to give them to us.' More fundamentally, child soldiers are highly prized. 'An officer told me that children are more obedient and less afraid than adults, so they use them on the front line,' said Manegabe. 'And of course they don't complain as much when they aren't paid.' The Mai Mai are even more committed to youth. They claim to possess a charm which makes warriors invincible, provided its conditions are stringently observed. 'Even though the children have the magic, we shouldn't ignore the fact that they are still underage soldiers,' said Manegabe. Like all Save the Children's staff in Bukavu, he is convinced of the charm's efficacy. Little Byamungu is more sceptical: 'There is no medicine against a bullet. Whenever we shot Mai Mai, they died.' It is one thing to pull children out of the army, quite another to keep them out. Many join up to escape the poverty of a country ravaged by war: at least four boys have passed through the demob centre twice. 'The only people guaranteed not to starve in Congo are those with guns,' said Claude Jibidar, UN co-ordinator for the province. More than 70 per cent of eastern Congo's schools have been closed by the war. Charlotte Ernique has a new dress from Save the Children and a head newly shaved by the RCD. She is 15 but, like virtually all the children at the demob centre, years of malnutrition have made her look much younger. Last month Charlotte gave up prostitution and joined the RCD because she was scared of getting Aids. She says she cannot go back to her village because she was forced to leave when a neighbour accused her of witchcraft. 'And anyway my parents had no food for me. The army was a hard life because I was beaten,' she said. 'But I did not ask to leave. If not prostitution, what am I to do? I will have to go into the army again.' The UN has failed miserably to address the root cause of the use of children as soldiers: the war. A year after they were promised, almost no UN military observers have been deployed. 'We cannot hope for everybody to suddenly wake up and stop the war. But we must at least pull the children out,' said Jibidar.",

The freshness of materials - from nuts and spices to fruit, cream and honeys - means that his chocolates have a shelf life of just two to three weeks (rather than the more usual three months). The gamut of flavours runs from cinnamon, banana and thyme to salted caramel; a 100g assortment box containing 12 random flavours costs \u00a36.50 (plus postage and packing). The candying of orange and lemon peels is labour intensive (and Cole Man is first and foremost a chocolatier), so these are bought in, ready-candied, from France (particularly fragrant Seville oranges at this time of year), and then enrobed in dark (70 per cent solids) chocolate in the UK: expect to pay around \u00a36 per 100g. Other delights include a crispy feuillantine biscuit, made from a pancake mix bound with praline and infused with gingerbread spice, which is also covered in dark chocolate; and nougatine, similar to a Florentine, with the crunch of hazelnuts and almonds in crisp caramel, also in dark chocolate (both \u00a35 for 100g).</p> <p>In addition to supplying a few well-known restaurants with petits fours, L'Atelier also has a stall in London's Borough Market on Saturdays, and sells a small range of items through outlets such as <b> Villandry </b> (170 Great Portland Street, London W1; 020 7631 3131), where chocolate truffles sell at \u00a37.95 for a 150g bag, and the assorted flavoured chocolates cost \u00a38.95 for 100g.</p> <p>Equally indulgent confections made by <b> Bettys &amp; Taylors </b> of Harrogate (Pagoda House, Plumpton Park, Harrogate; 0845 345 3636) include their Swiss-inspired Chocolate Desires (the chocolate-making staff has all trained in Lucerne), which consist of chocolate discs topped with roasted hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts and raisins (\u00a36.95 for 140g); and Fruit Clusters made from Italian citrus peels, Australian sultanas, American raisins and Turkish apricots, coated variously in milk, white, and rich dark chocolate (\u00a37.25 for 300g). You will have to add a charge of \u00a37 per consignment.</p> <p><b> Konditor &amp; Cook </b> (22 Cornwall Road, London SE1, 020 7261 0456; and 10 Stoney Street, London SE1, 020 7407 5100) is another reliable source of quality bakery and confection, with a wide range of treats, including double chocolate chip brownies (Boston Brownies) with cranberries (\u00a31.50 each), and Millionaire Shortbread topped with toffee and Belgian chocolate (\u00a31.10 each). Raspberry chocolate fudge tart in a sweet pastry case retails at \u00a31.75 a slice (or \u00a317.50 for a whole one). Flour-free cakes and biscuits are another line, taking in white chocolate and coconut macaroons (\u00a34.25 a bag, or 99p each for a larger size), and a moist, dense, Greek orange and almond cake (\u00a31.65 a slice or \u00a318.15 for the whole cake).</p> <p>The sweetmeats on offer at <a href=\"http://www.carluccios.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Carluccio's</a> (mail order - 12 Great Portland Street, London W1, 020 7580 3050; shop - 28a Neal Street, London WC2, 020 7240 1487; caf\u00e9 - 8 Market Place, London W1, 020 7636 2228) are imported from Italy and mostly designed to accompany coffee. Croquante bars (Sicilian almonds in crunchy caramel, 58p each) are like peanut brittle; nocini (also from Sicily) consist of half a walnut on coffee cream on a disc of marzipan, all covered in bitter chocolate (25p each); while gianduiotti from Piedmont combine a paste of hazelnuts and praline in chocolate (six pieces \u00a33.99, 24 for \u00a310).</p> <p>\u0095 Jim Ainsworth is editor of The Good Food Guide.</p>",

Equally indulgent confections made by Bettys &amp; Taylors of Harrogate (Pagoda House, Plumpton Park, Harrogate; 0845 345 3636) include their Swiss-inspired Chocolate Desires (the chocolate-making staff has all trained in Lucerne), which consist of chocolate discs topped with roasted hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts and raisins (\u00a36.95 for 140g); and Fruit Clusters made from Italian citrus peels, Australian sultanas, American raisins and Turkish apricots, coated variously in milk, white, and rich dark chocolate (\u00a37.25 for 300g). You will have to add a charge of \u00a37 per consignment. Konditor &amp; Cook (22 Cornwall Road, London SE1, 020 7261 0456; and 10 Stoney Street, London SE1, 020 7407 5100) is another reliable source of quality bakery and confection, with a wide range of treats, including double chocolate chip brownies (Boston Brownies) with cranberries (\u00a31.50 each), and Millionaire Shortbread topped with toffee and Belgian chocolate (\u00a31.10 each). Raspberry chocolate fudge tart in a sweet pastry case retails at \u00a31.75 a slice (or \u00a317.50 for a whole one). Flour-free cakes and biscuits are another line, taking in white chocolate and coconut macaroons (\u00a34.25 a bag, or 99p each for a larger size), and a moist, dense, Greek orange and almond cake (\u00a31.65 a slice or \u00a318.15 for the whole cake). The sweetmeats on offer at Carluccio's (mail order - 12 Great Portland Street, London W1, 020 7580 3050; shop - 28a Neal Street, London WC2, 020 7240 1487; caf\u00e9 - 8 Market Place, London W1, 020 7636 2228) are imported from Italy and mostly designed to accompany coffee. Croquante bars (Sicilian almonds in crunchy caramel, 58p each) are like peanut brittle; nocini (also from Sicily) consist of half a walnut on coffee cream on a disc of marzipan, all covered in bitter chocolate (25p each); while gianduiotti from Piedmont combine a paste of hazelnuts and praline in chocolate (six pieces \u00a33.99, 24 for \u00a310). \u0095 Jim Ainsworth is editor of The Good Food Guide.",

Coming from a secure background has given me the freedom to live the nomadic life of an actor, knowing that in the future there will be plenty of time to settle down. </p> <p> When my father read the script for Spike and asked if he could play Vernon, the obnoxious car salesman, my first reaction was, 'No, it's my project.' Simon Day had written the part of Verity, Vernon's daughter, for me. Many producers were reluctant to put my father in a role where he had to swear and be pretty ghastly. Luckily, the Nuffield Theatre viewed it as an exciting paradox. There's something about my father that whatever he does people still think he's adorable. At the end of Spike, after he's done the most horrendous things, you look at the audience and they're grinning from ear to ear. </p> <p> My mother is also acting in the play as Vernon's wife, so it's a real family affair. I do have moments when I think, 'Oh my God, I'm acting with my dad.' However, you're so in the world of the play that relationships are left backstage. Watching my father rehearse is like witnessing a Trojan horse gear up for battle: he'll go over and over a scene until it's right. I admire his stamina and sheer bloody-mindedness. I've inherited some of those traits, as well as his amazing talent for whingeing. </p> <p><strong> Richard Briers:</strong> We've always been a really close family. Work commitments meant I was around a lot during the day, while the children were growing up. I was narrating children's cartoons at the time, so on days out I'd always mimic and put on funny voices - we had a lot of fun. Both of my daughters were very creative: Kate loved to dance and was very practical. Lucy had the broader artistic talent. She did sculpture, music and painting, as well as drama. When she decided to plump for acting, I left it to my wife Ann to encourage her - we were frightened I would be a bit overpowering.</p> <p> I was the one who had 'made it', while Ann was the ordinary working actress. It was good for Lucy to see the spectrum of the business in one household. </p> <p> I think our relationship is developing into a profound friendship. She respects me - thank God! - and I equally respect her talent. We work together quite instinctively. We're both highly strung people so we'd often flare up at home - especially when she was younger. </p> <p> There's definitely a gene or two of me in Lucy: she can play comedy very well. We're very alike and I realise it more so now she's actress, rather than as the little girl I used to know. We have the same sense of humour: she sends me up as an old ham actor and I send her up as my starry-eyed daughter. </p> <p> Acting with family is a little strange.

      "body": "<p>This weekend I'm taking my nine-year-old nephew, Tom, on his first skiing holiday in Austria. Because I'm a little worried that Austrian cuisine may not appeal to Tom's vegetarian tastes, I've been wondering what to squeeze into my suitcase for him to eat. Tom, who has been brought up since birth as a strict vegetarian, is lucky in that his mother is a good cook who knows how important it is to give her children a balanced diet. Some of the vegetarian children and teenagers I see in my practice aren't so fortunate and, vegetables apart, are often confused about what they need to eat.</p> <p>Although children can grow up perfectly healthily without consuming meat or fish, it is vital that a vegetarian diet includes a regular and plentiful supply of protein, which the body needs to build strong muscles, repair tissues and maintain the effective functioning of its immune and hormonal systems. Proteins are broken down within the body by digestive enzymes and are absorbed into the blood as amino acids (the 'building blocks' of protein), which are then used to build and repair cells as needed, any surplus being used either as an energy source or stored as fat.</p> <p>There are two types of amino acids, essential and non-essential, and while the body can generate non-essential amino acids from other sources, it can only obtain essential amino acids from food. If you're a vegetarian, it's crucial to eat foods that contain all the essential amino acids, including eggs, dairy products and soya-based foods such as tofu. Beans, pulses, grains, nuts, seeds and manufactured vegetable proteins such as Quorn don't contain all of the essential amino acids that your body needs, but, combined, they should make up much of the imbalance. If I serve Tom lentil soup with crusty white bread, vegetable kebabs with rice and satay sauce (made with protein-rich peanuts) or baked beans with wholegrain toast, for example, his body will be able to maintain a healthy stock of protein, which wouldn't be the case if he ate baked beans on their own.</p> <p>Many vegetarian children are also in danger of becoming deficient in calcium, so I need to make sure that Tom has plenty of milky drinks. Although chocolate contains oxalates that inhibit the body's absorption of calcium, a steaming mug of hot chocolate made with milk will ensure that his body derives at least some calcium from it. Other calcium-rich foods that I'll try to cajole him into eating include yogurt, dark-green leafy vegetables and dried apricots and nuts to snack on while he's on the piste.</p> <p><b> Nutrition news: Voting with your food</b></p> <p>What you eat may influence the way you vote. Some fascinating research carried out by Allen et al, at the University of Newcastle's department of psychology in Australia, into the values and beliefs of vegetarians and omnivores concludes that omnivores are more likely to place less value on emotive issues than vegetarians and to endorse right-wing principles.</p> <p><b>Your questions</b></p> <p>I've been feeling drained and worn out for the past three months. Is there anything I can eat or drink to make myself feel better?<br><b> Sophie Spearman, Redding</b></p> <p>The first thing that you should do is see your GP to ascertain whether you're suffering from iron-deficiency anaemia. If tests show that you are indeed deficient in iron, start to include more foods that are rich in both iron and vitamin C (which helps your body to absorb iron) in your diet, and your haemoglobin level should quickly rise, making you feel stronger. Unless your iron levels are seriously low, try to eat more iron-rich foods rather than taking an iron supplement, many of which cause constipation, diarrhoea or nausea. Lean, red meat, game, liver and kidneys (but avoid offal if you are pregnant - it contains too much vitamin A), green leafy vegetables, watercress, broccoli, eggs, lentils, blackcurrants, black treacle and chocolate are all packed full of iron. Foods that contain vitamin C include fresh vegetables, kiwi fruits, blueberries, cabbage and dark-green, leafy vegetables. Try to have these before or after your meal - perhaps a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice beforehand or a fruit salad afterwards - to enable your body to better absorb the iron.</p> <p>Steer clear of caffeine while your iron levels are low: not only can it badly disrupt your sleeping patterns and energy levels by stimulating your body to step up its production of insulin, the hormone that lowers blood-sugar levels, but it also inhibits your body's absorption of iron. Opt for a cup of good-quality decaffeinated coffee, tea or a herbal infusion instead, and aim to drink at 2.5 litres of water a day.</p> <p>\u0095 Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician.

Many vegetarian children are also in danger of becoming deficient in calcium, so I need to make sure that Tom has plenty of milky drinks. Although chocolate contains oxalates that inhibit the body's absorption of calcium, a steaming mug of hot chocolate made with milk will ensure that his body derives at least some calcium from it. Other calcium-rich foods that I'll try to cajole him into eating include yogurt, dark-green leafy vegetables and dried apricots and nuts to snack on while he's on the piste. Nutrition news: Voting with your food What you eat may influence the way you vote. Some fascinating research carried out by Allen et al, at the University of Newcastle's department of psychology in Australia, into the values and beliefs of vegetarians and omnivores concludes that omnivores are more likely to place less value on emotive issues than vegetarians and to endorse right-wing principles. Your questions I've been feeling drained and worn out for the past three months. Is there anything I can eat or drink to make myself feel better? Sophie Spearman, Redding The first thing that you should do is see your GP to ascertain whether you're suffering from iron-deficiency anaemia. If tests show that you are indeed deficient in iron, start to include more foods that are rich in both iron and vitamin C (which helps your body to absorb iron) in your diet, and your haemoglobin level should quickly rise, making you feel stronger. Unless your iron levels are seriously low, try to eat more iron-rich foods rather than taking an iron supplement, many of which cause constipation, diarrhoea or nausea. Lean, red meat, game, liver and kidneys (but avoid offal if you are pregnant - it contains too much vitamin A), green leafy vegetables, watercress, broccoli, eggs, lentils, blackcurrants, black treacle and chocolate are all packed full of iron. Foods that contain vitamin C include fresh vegetables, kiwi fruits, blueberries, cabbage and dark-green, leafy vegetables. Try to have these before or after your meal - perhaps a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice beforehand or a fruit salad afterwards - to enable your body to better absorb the iron. Steer clear of caffeine while your iron levels are low: not only can it badly disrupt your sleeping patterns and energy levels by stimulating your body to step up its production of insulin, the hormone that lowers blood-sugar levels, but it also inhibits your body's absorption of iron. Opt for a cup of good-quality decaffeinated coffee, tea or a herbal infusion instead, and aim to drink at 2.5 litres of water a day. \u0095 Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician.

      "body": "<p>Like the chip off the old block he most certainly is, Kevin Noye stuck up for his dear old double-killer dad: 'We don't want it put about that my dad is squealing to the police, because he isn't.' </p> <p>Well, somebody tipped off The Sweeney - Scotland Yard's Flying Squad - that at least some of the 6,800 gold ingots stolen from the Brink's-Mat high security warehouse in Heathrow on 26 November 1983, had been hidden underneath farm buildings or a cabbage patch in a Sussex village called Ore. </p> <p>Would Ore be the place where Kenny stashed his gold ingots? Bit obvious, eh? Not if you know that whenever you walked into Kenny Noye's old mansion in Kent, Shirley Bassey's rendition of 'Goldfinger' blasted out of the stereo. Hum that tune and read on. </p> <p>The search for Kenny Noye's gold may be long and fruitless, but the police turned up with a mechanical digger, a pneumatic drill, X-ray imaging equipment and the determination to nail a cop-killer. Long before Noye was jailed for the M25 road-rage murder of Stephen Cameron, he killed PC John Fordham, an undercover cop who made the mis take of loitering around Noye's herbaceous borders at night wearing a black Balaclava. Noye pleaded self-defence and the jury acquitted him of murder. He did serve an eight stretch for smelting some of the Brink's-Mat gold, and then he was a free man, albeit one with a volcanic temper, as Cameron discovered to his cost in 1996. </p> <p>But where is the missing gold? The police reckon around half of the treasure was melted down and turned into jewellery, or sold back to bullion dealers Johnson Matthey, who owned it in the first place. Eleven bars of the gold were found in 1985 and melted down, and a further \u00a31m of gold was later recovered from - where else? - the Bank of England. It was being stored in the Old Lady after re-entering the legal market. Three tons of the gold, worth \u00a310m, is still missing. So where is it? </p> <p>A village called Ore? Well, after five days of digging up concrete, the cops gave up. Not Ore, then. But Spain might be a good answer for, at least, some of it. </p> <p>The prospect from the house where Kenny Noye - freemason, gold-smelter, and a 'face' (Cockney argot for villain) with two dead men on his conscience - lived when on the run from the M25 stabbing is one of the most beguilingly beautiful in all of Europe. It has a view, you could say, to kill for. </p> <p>Down below is the golden scimitar of Atlanterra beach, first discovered, they say, by a couple of Nazis on the run after the Second World War. Out to sea, the blue Atlantic, scuffed by white horses, a two-masted yawl riding the chop. Out there, whales and dolphins cavort, and the big-game fishing is so easy it was a favourite hunting ground for Franco, el Caudillo , the squeaky-voiced tyrant who loved to wash his hands in the 'detergent of blood'. </p> <p>Due south, the rising brown foothills of the Atlas Mountains, north Africa. Due north, a small cape, beyond that, just out of view, the low green mass of the Cape of Trafalgar, which Nelson lost and won in 1805. </p> <p>The house with the view of Trafalgar is set high up above the bay, nestling amid swaying palms, with the scent of pine strong in the cooling breeze. Two storeys, white walls, spartan style, good taste. The contrast with Kenny Noye's cell in the 'A' unit in the secure-as-can-be wing of Whitemoor Prison, Cambridgeshire, is stark. But from his prison cell, the man who is serving time for stabbing Stephen Cameron to death on the M25, might reflect that things are not going too badly. The police are still trying to find the rest of the gold, and still failing. </p> <p> Remember what happened to Alan Decabral, the most emphatic witness at the M25 murder trial? The roly-poly crook with shoulder-length scruffy hair had been an eye-witness to the stabbing. He had turned up at the Old Bailey in his Roller and made a muffled titter pass round the courtroom when his mobile went off while he was giving evidence. Noye didn't laugh, though. Decabral told the jury: 'I saw the knife go into his chest, I saw the blood, I'll never forget his face.' </p> <p>After Noye was sent down, Decabral - a hefty brute with his own lines in naughty business - made an unusual plug for a well-known supermarket: 'I look over my shoulder every time I go into Sainsbury's.' </p> <p>Last October, someone walked up to Decabral's black Peugeot 206, pulled out a gun and fired a single shot into his head. There is, of course, no suggestion that Kenny Noye had a hand in Decabral's execution. On the face of it, the last person who wanted Decabral dead would be the most obvious suspect - Kenny Noye. The police investigating the murder did plan to chat with Noye, however, because it was - how should one put this? - a bit of a coincidence. </p> <p>Before his wet-job (gangster slang for assassination), Decabral had claimed that there had been an attempt to stop him giving evidence. He alleged that on one occasion three bullets were pushed through his letter-box, although the police say he never reported this. </p> <p>As the detectives started to poke around in Decabral's history, it became embarrassingly obvious that Noye wasn't the only punter who had reason to dislike the Rolls-Royce driving Hell's Angel. Decabral ran heroin and cocaine and guns and tobacco and alcohol. He had a\u00a3250,000 three-bedroomed house in Pluckley, Kent - the picturesque village made famous by the television series Darling Buds of May . He paid cash for the house. </p> <p>The fat man, too, had fallen out with his ex. Charmingly, she told the Sunday Mirror : 'My Alan Lied To Jail Noye'. The tabloid trumpeted: 'Now wife of murdered key witness says: \"I'll give evidence for him at appeal\". Ann Marie Decabral, 33, said that her late hubby Alan had 'embellished' his story in an attempt to get police to stop a drugs and firearms investigation involving him. 'I know people will hate me for saying this, but everyone deserves the right to a fair trial - even Kenneth Noye,' said Ann Marie. </p> <p>'I believe he did wrong and should be in prison for killing that poor boy Stephen Cameron, but I don't think it was premeditated. I don't think he got out of the car thinking, \"I am going to murder him.\"' </p> <p>Decabral had told the Old Bailey that after he witnessed the stabbing he gave chase, trying to clock Noye's registration number. But Ann Marie told the Mirror : 'That was rubbish. He was driving away from the scene because he didn't want to be stopped by the police. Alan had been on his way to Lewes, in Sussex, to drop off a consignment of cocaine. He told me that he used the car chase as an excuse because he feared being arrested.' </p> <p>Noye cannot have read this story without a certain satisfaction. His appeal has not yet been slotted, but the late Decabral is not exactly up there with the Archbishop of Canterbury in the reliability stakes. The cops raided his house just one month after Noye was nicked in Spain. Police found an arsenal of 56 weapons - including machine guns - 36g of cocaine and \u00a3160,000 in cash. </p> <p>Decabral was arrested, but the gun charges were dropped. The firearms - some deactivated - and the cash were later returned to him. His house was raided again by police just two days before he was executed. </p> <p>At Noye's trial, Ann Marie was furious. She said that Decabral had given her address in court when he gave evidence. She knew of Noye's reputation and feared that she and their two children - Charlotte, 12, and Dean, eight - would become reprisal targets. She said: 'I really feared that somebody would kill me and the children.' </p> <p>Wanting the truth out, she wrote to Kenny Noye in Whitemoor. She got a phone call. 'This bloke said: \"Hi, I'm Kevin Noye, Kenny's son\". I nearly dropped the phone.' They arranged to meet 30 minutes later outside McDonald's in Eltham, south-east London. Ann Marie said: 'I was so nervous that Kevin said he could tell it was me from 20 yards away. We sat in his car and he asked me what information I had and why I wrote to his dad. I told him that Alan had lied under oath, and he asked me could I prove this. I said that I could.' She also told Kevin how frightened she was of his father. 'He said, \"Why would my father want to harm you?\"' </p> <p>Kevin and his brother Brett Noye are loyal sons to their dad, another source of satisfaction to the man in Whitemoor. I may even have bumped into Kevin or Brett myself, though we didn't exchange visiting cards. </p> <p> Six months ago I went looking for Kenny Noye's house. I flew into Marbella and drove down through the Costa del Sol, Europe's crapulous impression of Miami and all its vice, and the familiar lair of the East End gangsters out for a tan, jam-packed between the high-rise tat hotels of Torremelinos and the dirty money gin palaces of Puerto Banus, the port of Marbella. There, you can buy your copy of The Currant Bun mint-fresh from Wapping, Rollers cruise for tarts and every now and then an old face gets a wet-job for breaking the unwritten law of Doug and Dinsdale Piranha, or whoever. </p> <p>The Costa del Sol is simply hot East End, a virtual extension of the District Line. Events in the Costa del Sol whizz back to the East End, and vice versa. So it was in Marbella that Great Train Robber Charlie 'The Silent Man' Wilson was gunned down by a pale-faced assassin on a yellow mountain bike back in 1990. The killer shot The Silent Man's dog, too. The prime suspect for that killing, Danny 'Scarface' Roff - already partially paralysed from a previous, failed hit - was rubbed out in the spring of 1997 as he arrived home in his Mercedes at Wanstead Road, Bromley, Kent. The problem with the Costa is that there are too many old faces around who might have shopped Noye to the law, long suspected of being a police grass when it suited them, for the murder of Stephen Cameron. And ever since Noye stabbed to death undercover policeman John Fordham and got off on a plea of self-defence, he has been a serious target for law enforcement. For a fugitive, the Costa's no place to hide. </p> <p>But Spain's Atlantic coast, which runs west from the rock of Gibraltar to Atlanterra to Cadiz and up to the Portuguese border, is a secret paradise, unspoilt, seductive, where the bars aren't routinely called The Benny Hill or the London Pride. Here, the Atlantic is colder than the Med, the breeze fresher, the countryside not concreted over, the clientele mainly Spanish and German. </p> <p>The selection of Atlanterra and the tastefulness of the house shows that Noye was - is - no fool. He bought the house from an edgy German businessman called Hans Bartom in 1997. The German sported a soft-top Merc and a chilly manner, and wanted to sell up to get back to Hamburg. Noye, calling himself 'Michael Mayne', aka 'Micky The Builder', agreed to pay the price of 50m pesetas, about \u00a3200,000. Like all true gentlemen, Noye paid cash. But with whose money? </p> <p>The house looked as though it had been suddenly abandoned, a hint of the Marie Celeste about it. Cobwebs thickened around the fat mirrors of the dark blue Pajero 4x4 Noye used to drive at reckless speeds around Atlanterra. There was a rhino bar on the front, of course, just in case a foolish pedestrian might have damaged one of Noye's headlights with a careless pelvis. The car's bonnet was pattered with smut from raindrops, long since evaporated. Inside, a no-smoking sign hung from the mirror, fading in the sun. Not far away was a watering can, alone and greenly loitering. </p> <p>The water in the swimming pool out front was fetid, rank and gangrene-green, the house shuttered and barred. But something about the empty desolation was not quite right. The house that Kenny Noye lived in and the car he drove had been unused since five undercover cops, British and Spanish, found him and his sultry mistress, Mina Al Taiba, in the nearby El Campero restaurant in late August, 1998. To add insult to injury, the undercover cops pretended they were drunk and had sung Prodigy's 'Firestarter' to allay his suspicions. Then they sat on him. He was tried, convicted and is currently serving at Her Majesty's Pleasure, though he intends to appeal conviction and sentence on the grounds of self-defence. </p> <p>A house unused, but not quite abandoned. It took a moment to work out what was wrong, the dog that didn't bark in the Sherlock Holmes story. It was under our feet, a witness that could not be bought off. The grass was sweet, well-watered, unnaturally green in the heat, and manicured to a tidy length. Had the garden been abandoned, completely, we should have been looking at long lengths of grass, burnt brown in the sun. Someone had been looking after Kenny Noye's lawn. </p> <p>The gardener was an Andalusian with thinning hair, clipping away at some grass on the other side of the road from the villa. Did he know who owned the villa over there? </p> <p>'I look after it,' he said in the sing-song Spanish of Andalusia. </p> <p>Yes, but who owns it? Kenny Noye? </p> <p>'Listen, I am paid good money to look after that place, but that's all. I am not paid any money to answer these questions.' </p> <p>'What's your name?' </p> <p>'What do you want to ask my name for?' His eyes clouded over. He bent down and picked up a biggish, thick stick, and weighed it in his hand. </p> <p>'That's it. Okay?' </p> <p>The gardener with no name wasn't telling who was paying the bills. On our way out, a Spanish-looking guy in a big Range Rover clocked us in his side mirror, then held his stare, letting us know that we had been clocked. If this sounds like a cheap rewrite of a Raymond Chandler, then that is exactly what it felt like. Twenty minutes up the road was the Las Dunas bar, a thatched-roof, airy bar with a pool table and a clientele of surfers, windsurfers and beach bums. In a corner, a small sign in Spanish: 'Don't use drugs in this bar.' A small, dark-haired Spaniard loafed towards us and offered top-of-the-range hashish, from just across the water. </p> <p>Not today, thanks, we're working. </p> <p>The barmaid did her business, and volunteered that this was the bar where Kenny hung out. 'He came here with his wife and kids, he was a normal guy. We had no idea that he was wanted for bad things back in Britain. He was normal, a good customer.' </p> <p>Outside, the photographer took a few snaps of the bar, just for keepsakes. As he was doing so a dusty yellow Mercedes with German plates reversed up a slight incline towards us, music blaring from its sound system. The driver was young, blond, wearing square-frame shades. He looked more English than Spanish, blunt-faced, handsome-ish, a strong arm dangling over his door. He let the clutch slip and the Mercedes dropped towards the photographer. </p> <p>'Watch out,' he said in Spanish. </p> <p>The photographer curved his pelvis out of the way, like a bullfighter. And then Mr Blond reversed up the incline again, and studied us, and waited until the photographer turned his back to carry on working. And then the blond guy gave me the finger, and the scene froze, five seconds, 10. It's happened before and it will happen again, but there was something special about the way he held his finger, calm, implacable, hard. It could have been anyone, but it felt like someone close to Noye. The blond man with the finger looked the spitting image of the old man. Then, whoever he was drove off, the sound system blurting out garage to the cacti. </p> <p> Journalism is not rocket science. You talk to people, police, customs, lawyers, and do your homework, read the cuts in all the newspapers - irritatingly the tabloids often do better with the eroticism of detail than the more high-minded qualities - and any books. Every paper in the land has wallowed in the story of Kenny Noye, and Wensley Clarkson has knocked out a quickie biog, Killer On The Road: The Murder, The Millions, The Face-Changing Surgery... The True Story of Kenneth Noye, Britain's Public Enemy Number One . The breathless title is matched only by the deathless prose. After a while, you begin to get a feel for the subject. It is a fascinating yet disturbing process. The qualities about Noye which stand out are his charm, his terrible temper, his cunning and his contempt for the rest of us. In particular, the taxpayer. </p> <p>For the M25 murder trial, Kenny Noye got free legal aid worth around \u00a3250,000. His appeal, too, will be underwritten by the taxpayer. The Legal Aid Board isn't exactly Oxfam. If you have a serious amount of money, then the board expects you to contribute to your defence. Noye's 4x4 would be worth \u00a315,000, and the house with the view of Trafalgar has now been sold, reportedly for \u00a3500,000. His mistress in Spain, Mina Al Taiba, lives in a \u00a3150,000 apartment paid for by Noye. His wife Brenda lives in quiet luxury in the Cornish fishing village of Looe, running up to the shops in a brand new \u00a350,000 Mercedes sports car. Kevin and Brett Noye seem to have a bit of cash. And then there's the \u00a310m missing from the Brink's-Mat job. </p> <p>So why should taxpayers stump up for the double-killer's defence and appeal, if Noye had a house to kill for and a car to match? It is a good question. </p> <p>Two officials at the Lord Chancellor's department working at the Old Bailey okayed Kenny Noye's legal aid without going through the correct procedures. They didn't do anything dishonest, they were just dull-witted. One resigned, the other has been reprimanded. After all, a quarter of a million pounds of public money is chickenfeed compared with the price of wallpaper these days. The Lord Chancellor's Department won't release any names. That might be embarrassing for the two officials who didn't do their job properly. </p> <p>Everyone is entitled to a fair trial. If they are poor, it could be at the taxpayers' expense. Nevertheless, when Kenny Noye's appeal comes to court, and it is announced that he's receiving legal aid, it is just conceivable that some taxpayers might think they are being ripped off by a millionaire double-killer who likes the sound of 'Goldfinger'.</p>",

She said: 'I really feared that somebody would kill me and the children.' Wanting the truth out, she wrote to Kenny Noye in Whitemoor. She got a phone call. 'This bloke said: \"Hi, I'm Kevin Noye, Kenny's son\". I nearly dropped the phone.' They arranged to meet 30 minutes later outside McDonald's in Eltham, south-east London. Ann Marie said: 'I was so nervous that Kevin said he could tell it was me from 20 yards away. We sat in his car and he asked me what information I had and why I wrote to his dad. I told him that Alan had lied under oath, and he asked me could I prove this. I said that I could.' She also told Kevin how frightened she was of his father. 'He said, \"Why would my father want to harm you?\"' Kevin and his brother Brett Noye are loyal sons to their dad, another source of satisfaction to the man in Whitemoor. I may even have bumped into Kevin or Brett myself, though we didn't exchange visiting cards. Six months ago I went looking for Kenny Noye's house. I flew into Marbella and drove down through the Costa del Sol, Europe's crapulous impression of Miami and all its vice, and the familiar lair of the East End gangsters out for a tan, jam-packed between the high-rise tat hotels of Torremelinos and the dirty money gin palaces of Puerto Banus, the port of Marbella. There, you can buy your copy of The Currant Bun mint-fresh from Wapping, Rollers cruise for tarts and every now and then an old face gets a wet-job for breaking the unwritten law of Doug and Dinsdale Piranha, or whoever. The Costa del Sol is simply hot East End, a virtual extension of the District Line. Events in the Costa del Sol whizz back to the East End, and vice versa. So it was in Marbella that Great Train Robber Charlie 'The Silent Man' Wilson was gunned down by a pale-faced assassin on a yellow mountain bike back in 1990. The killer shot The Silent Man's dog, too. The prime suspect for that killing, Danny 'Scarface' Roff - already partially paralysed from a previous, failed hit - was rubbed out in the spring of 1997 as he arrived home in his Mercedes at Wanstead Road, Bromley, Kent. The problem with the Costa is that there are too many old faces around who might have shopped Noye to the law, long suspected of being a police grass when it suited them, for the murder of Stephen Cameron. And ever since Noye stabbed to death undercover policeman John Fordham and got off on a plea of self-defence, he has been a serious target for law enforcement. For a fugitive, the Costa's no place to hide. But Spain's Atlantic coast, which runs west from the rock of Gibraltar to Atlanterra to Cadiz and up to the Portuguese border, is a secret paradise, unspoilt, seductive, where the bars aren't routinely called The Benny Hill or the London Pride. Here, the Atlantic is colder than the Med, the breeze fresher, the countryside not concreted over, the clientele mainly Spanish and German. The selection of Atlanterra and the tastefulness of the house shows that Noye was - is - no fool. He bought the house from an edgy German businessman called Hans Bartom in 1997. The German sported a soft-top Merc and a chilly manner, and wanted to sell up to get back to Hamburg. Noye, calling himself 'Michael Mayne', aka 'Micky The Builder', agreed to pay the price of 50m pesetas, about \u00a3200,000. Like all true gentlemen, Noye paid cash. But with whose money? The house looked as though it had been suddenly abandoned, a hint of the Marie Celeste about it. Cobwebs thickened around the fat mirrors of the dark blue Pajero 4x4 Noye used to drive at reckless speeds around Atlanterra. There was a rhino bar on the front, of course, just in case a foolish pedestrian might have damaged one of Noye's headlights with a careless pelvis. The car's bonnet was pattered with smut from raindrops, long since evaporated. Inside, a no-smoking sign hung from the mirror, fading in the sun. Not far away was a watering can, alone and greenly loitering. The water in the swimming pool out front was fetid, rank and gangrene-green, the house shuttered and barred. But something about the empty desolation was not quite right. The house that Kenny Noye lived in and the car he drove had been unused since five undercover cops, British and Spanish, found him and his sultry mistress, Mina Al Taiba, in the nearby El Campero restaurant in late August, 1998. To add insult to injury, the undercover cops pretended they were drunk and had sung Prodigy's 'Firestarter' to allay his suspicions. Then they sat on him. He was tried, convicted and is currently serving at Her Majesty's Pleasure, though he intends to appeal conviction and sentence on the grounds of self-defence. A house unused, but not quite abandoned. It took a moment to work out what was wrong, the dog that didn't bark in the Sherlock Holmes story. It was under our feet, a witness that could not be bought off. The grass was sweet, well-watered, unnaturally green in the heat, and manicured to a tidy length. Had the garden been abandoned, completely, we should have been looking at long lengths of grass, burnt brown in the sun. Someone had been looking after Kenny Noye's lawn. The gardener was an Andalusian with thinning hair, clipping away at some grass on the other side of the road from the villa. Did he know who owned the villa over there? 'I look after it,' he said in the sing-song Spanish of Andalusia. Yes, but who owns it? Kenny Noye? 'Listen, I am paid good money to look after that place, but that's all. I am not paid any money to answer these questions.' 'What's your name?' 'What do you want to ask my name for?' His eyes clouded over. He bent down and picked up a biggish, thick stick, and weighed it in his hand. 'That's it. Okay?' The gardener with no name wasn't telling who was paying the bills. On our way out, a Spanish-looking guy in a big Range Rover clocked us in his side mirror, then held his stare, letting us know that we had been clocked. If this sounds like a cheap rewrite of a Raymond Chandler, then that is exactly what it felt like. Twenty minutes up the road was the Las Dunas bar, a thatched-roof, airy bar with a pool table and a clientele of surfers, windsurfers and beach bums. In a corner, a small sign in Spanish: 'Don't use drugs in this bar.' A small, dark-haired Spaniard loafed towards us and offered top-of-the-range hashish, from just across the water. Not today, thanks, we're working. The barmaid did her business, and volunteered that this was the bar where Kenny hung out. 'He came here with his wife and kids, he was a normal guy. We had no idea that he was wanted for bad things back in Britain. He was normal, a good customer.' Outside, the photographer took a few snaps of the bar, just for keepsakes. As he was doing so a dusty yellow Mercedes with German plates reversed up a slight incline towards us, music blaring from its sound system. The driver was young, blond, wearing square-frame shades. He looked more English than Spanish, blunt-faced, handsome-ish, a strong arm dangling over his door. He let the clutch slip and the Mercedes dropped towards the photographer. 'Watch out,' he said in Spanish. The photographer curved his pelvis out of the way, like a bullfighter. And then Mr Blond reversed up the incline again, and studied us, and waited until the photographer turned his back to carry on working. And then the blond guy gave me the finger, and the scene froze, five seconds, 10. It's happened before and it will happen again, but there was something special about the way he held his finger, calm, implacable, hard. It could have been anyone, but it felt like someone close to Noye. The blond man with the finger looked the spitting image of the old man. Then, whoever he was drove off, the sound system blurting out garage to the cacti. Journalism is not rocket science. You talk to people, police, customs, lawyers, and do your homework, read the cuts in all the newspapers - irritatingly the tabloids often do better with the eroticism of detail than the more high-minded qualities - and any books. Every paper in the land has wallowed in the story of Kenny Noye, and Wensley Clarkson has knocked out a quickie biog, Killer On The Road: The Murder, The Millions, The Face-Changing Surgery... The True Story of Kenneth Noye, Britain's Public Enemy Number One . The breathless title is matched only by the deathless prose. After a while, you begin to get a feel for the subject. It is a fascinating yet disturbing process. The qualities about Noye which stand out are his charm, his terrible temper, his cunning and his contempt for the rest of us. In particular, the taxpayer. For the M25 murder trial, Kenny Noye got free legal aid worth around \u00a3250,000. His appeal, too, will be underwritten by the taxpayer. The Legal Aid Board isn't exactly Oxfam. If you have a serious amount of money, then the board expects you to contribute to your defence. Noye's 4x4 would be worth \u00a315,000, and the house with the view of Trafalgar has now been sold, reportedly for \u00a3500,000. His mistress in Spain, Mina Al Taiba, lives in a \u00a3150,000 apartment paid for by Noye. His wife Brenda lives in quiet luxury in the Cornish fishing village of Looe, running up to the shops in a brand new \u00a350,000 Mercedes sports car. Kevin and Brett Noye seem to have a bit of cash. And then there's the \u00a310m missing from the Brink's-Mat job. So why should taxpayers stump up for the double-killer's defence and appeal, if Noye had a house to kill for and a car to match? It is a good question. Two officials at the Lord Chancellor's department working at the Old Bailey okayed Kenny Noye's legal aid without going through the correct procedures. They didn't do anything dishonest, they were just dull-witted. One resigned, the other has been reprimanded. After all, a quarter of a million pounds of public money is chickenfeed compared with the price of wallpaper these days. The Lord Chancellor's Department won't release any names. That might be embarrassing for the two officials who didn't do their job properly. Everyone is entitled to a fair trial. If they are poor, it could be at the taxpayers' expense. Nevertheless, when Kenny Noye's appeal comes to court, and it is announced that he's receiving legal aid, it is just conceivable that some taxpayers might think they are being ripped off by a millionaire double-killer who likes the sound of 'Goldfinger'.",

      "body": "<p>It sounds like one of those dodgy posters you see stuck to pillars in supermarket car parks. 'Lose weight without dieting! Call me now to find out how!' In my case, however, it happens to be true. Well, almost. In the last eight months I have lost two stone and got my body fat down by 11 per cent. I have shrunk from a size 16/18 to an eight. I can't say this has been achieved while mainlining Mars Bars. Neither, however, have I had to starve myself. I have fought the flab by taking up weight training.</p> <p>I thought I knew about weight training. It was what very short men with an overwhelming inferiority complex did in one corner of the gym while everyone worked themselves into a frenzy on the Stairmaster in another. It made you big and bulky and kind of Hunchback of Notre Dame-ish. The only woman I had ever seen do it had a five o'clock shadow and appeared on documentaries about steroid abuse.</p> <p>Still, I was desperate. I had just had a baby and, at five feet tall, I weighed 11st. Kate Moss I was not. I'd been fat before. I spent my teenage wobbling around like a depressed weeble. In my early 20s I was a size 18 on a good day, with an elasticated waist and a following wind. I shifted three stone at one stage, jigging about to a Jane Fonda video and sticking to a 1,000 calorie-a-day diet. But of course the weight didn't stay off; I was so ravenous I would have breakfasted on carpet tiles had they had a faint whiff of chocolate about them.</p> <p>Having regained the flab, I went on another diet - and another and then another. I am now a dieting expert, having tried just about all of them - Scarsdale, F-Plan, Weightwatchers, etc - and they've all worked, at the time. It's staying skinny that I'm really bad at. Before the baby, I had managed to confine my yo-yoing to 20lb, but I still had to keep three wardrobes, fat, thin and middling. After the baby, I had added three more, early plump pregnancy, late heffalump stage and 'you think you're thin but you're not' post-pregnancy.</p> <p>Eight months ago, though, something clicked in my head. I was really determined. Pregnancy and the lack of control it gives you over your body makes the desire to be able to go into Kooka\u00ef and actually<b> </b> buy something white hot. I wanted a permanent solution and I was willing to try almost anything to achieve it.</p> <p>I went to see Pete Williams at West 1 On One. Pete is an exercise physiologist and a certified strength and conditioning specialist. The majority of his clients are professional athletes whose bodies he rebuilds after they have injured themselves. As a sideline, he trains normal members of the public, but they have to be prepared to accept a scientific rather than a cosmetic approach. Those who fancy putting on a fluorescent leotard and flinging their arms about to Shalamar while admiring their St Tropez tans in a full-length mirror need not apply.</p> <p>Instead, twice a week for the past eight months, I have taken the trip to Pete's gym just off Harley Street in central London. There, for an hour in a room remarkably bereft of fabby hi-tech equipment, Pete and/or his partner Doug, also a sports scientist, has put me through my paces. It is amazing the degree of torture that can be inflicted with only a broomstick, a wooden box and a 'therapy ball', like a space hopper but without horns.</p> <p>There are two main strands to the regime I have been following. The first addresses 'core stability' and involves exercises to strengthen the tummy muscles and back. I have never done sit-ups like these before, though. Normal sit-ups target the muscles that lie just beneath the surface. Core stability exercises work much deeper, tightening the transverse stomach muscles to really pull you in. If you've ever attempted 'The Boat' in a yoga class you will have some idea of the position I'm taking about. If you haven't, assume the press-up position and hold it, for ages and ages.</p> <p>The second strand involves 'strength training', aka weightlifting. Before Pete, my idea of weightlifting was strapping a pair of ankle weights on to make step aerobics a bit harder. When I saw the 'Olympic Bar', I almost had a heart attack. This is the huge bar bell that heavy-duty weightlifters use. The fear I felt wasn't so much that I wouldn't be able to pick it up. The worry was that I would, and what kind of girl would I be then? The kind with body hair and a voice like Barry White's, of course.</p> <p>For women, there is a real psychological barrier to weightlifting. An ambivalence about power in general. How many of us want to be independent, but still want Prince Charming to save us? So, instead of doing the sort of exercise that will make us stronger, self-sufficient and genuinely on a par with men, we punish our bodies and ourselves into exhausted puniness with hours on the treadmill or in an aerobics class. But there are sound scientific reasons for getting past the mind stuff.</p> <p>Thanks to so-called anabolic steroids, the term anabolic has got a bit of a bad name. When I heard it for the first time, alarm bells went off in my brain. However, anabolic is the state you want your body to be in - that is, building muscle. More muscle equals a higher metabolic rate, so combine this with a sensible diet and you will lose weight and keep it off. Restricting calorie intake and/or doing high-intensity aerobic exercise, on the other hand, makes your body catabolic. This means that your body breaks down muscle. This slows down your metabolism so that the minute you stop running five miles a day or have a piece of cake, you put all the weight back on.</p> <p>And the thing is you don't have to become Arnold Schwarzenegger for the anabolic approach to work. I am no bigger than I was eight months ago - quite the opposite. I am firmer, though. When I wave goodbye, my upper arm doesn't keep waving long after the rest of me has stopped, as it used to. Plus, I can now carry the shopping home from the supermarket without stopping to take little rests. My other half is relieved. He genuinely thought I would turn into a man.</p> <p>There has been another adjustment in my attitude - this time towards food. Initially, I was asked to keep a diet diary. When Pete looked at it, he asked, 'Where's the fat?' I replied rather smugly that I didn't eat fat. He was appalled. I was treated to a lecture about the evils of low-fat diets and, while cautioned to stay away from saturated fats, I was instructed to include nuts, seeds and oily fish in my diet. After a lifetime of diet salad dressings, it was quite scary to put olive oil (only a little) on my lettuce for the first time, but, blimey O'Reilly, it tastes better.</p> <p>I now also rattle because I am taking so many vitamins and, latterly, I have begun taking other supplements as well. One is called 'Thermokick', which sounds more exciting than it is. I also eat a high-protein bar called 'Muscle'. Having got over my fear of weightlifting, I now rather like the macho sound of that, although I conceal the wrappers from my husband.</p> <p>I have an identical twin who hasn't been weightlifting or had a baby, so it's interesting to compare bodies. I have lost a whopping six-and-a-half inches off my waist, but hers is still smaller. Her hips and bosoms are bigger, too. It could be that it's the breast feeding that has shrunk my cleavage, except that I only managed to do it for a week. Pete keeps promising that he can lift what bosoms I have left with specific exercises. I think he's being optimistic. My legs are better, but still chubby. Pete says if I give him two years I will be a goddess. We'll see.</p> <p>It hasn't been a doddle. If you are used to the adrenaline high you get from aerobics or running, weightlifting can seem boring at first, progress is slow and steady. However, it is immensely time efficient. Two hours a week has literally reshaped me. Plus, that shape appears to be here to stay (although I never say never). Over Christmas, I fell off the wagon more that a few times, yet I didn't turn into a blob. Before the weight training I could have put on half a stone a week, no problem. Now the yo-yoing is far less severe.</p> <p>There is another benefit. I have learnt to love my legs. After 20 years of hating them - I couldn't wear a mini like my friends as a teenager, because I looked like Henry VIII - I have found a use for them. It's something to do with gravity and short levels. But while tall girls will struggle to lift large weights, if you're short, weight training is easy peasy, lemon squeezy. At last, a reason to pity Giselle.</p> <p>\u0095 Pete Williams is at <a href=\"http://www.west1onone.com\" target=\"_NEW\">West 1 On One</a>, 40 Weymouth Street, London W1 (020 7486 3386).</p>",

The ancient Taoists evolved the necessary techniques to develop and harness mind-power in the service of healing self and others. They found that if one was able to collect one's consciousness into a tight ball, as it were, concentrated in the centre of one's brain, one could effect profound and radical changes in the physical structure of the body itself. Indeed the first acupuncture treatments were self-administered by early psychic explorers in a series of so-called trance patterns, comprising the insertion of 36 gold needles in various locations around the cranium. Effectively, these trance patterns would act as an inhibitor of forebrain activity, the site of one's internal dialogue, which otherwise would occlude the inner clarity prerequisite for self-healing. From this centre-brain vantage point, they found themselves able to command the actual cells of their bodies.</p> <p>The Taoists also discovered that mind-power was greatly amplified when harnessed to the breathing process. Once mind and breath are united, a form of psychically charged energy is generated, which the Taoists call 'chi' or light. When you send a thought to your right hand but at the same time breathe out imagining the breath to be travelling down your arm to your palm, for example, you are 'sending' chi or light to your hand. This can be applied to any body part of your choice. Sending chi is the essence of all oriental healing practices, including acupuncture, shiatsu (acupressure), and chi-gung healing. Even herbology focuses on clearing the pathways for chi to flow through.</p> <p>When you send chi to a particular part of your own body, semi-miraculous physical transformations can occur (I've seen it over and over in my own practice).

You may wish to inwardly command such sentiments as, 'I am now restructuring my brain cells on an atomic level to enable me to respond more readily to positive input. Or you could simply say something like, Heal, you buggers! It all depends on what kind of relationship you conduct with yourself.</p> <p>In fact, the whole art of positive thinking, especially with regards to self-healing, depends entirely on forming a respectful, warm and loving relationship with your own mind and body.

My friend had just returned from a long working trip to Australia and the Far East - the kind of thing DJs whose annual earnings go well into six figures tend to do when it gets chilly at home. Back in London for less than a day, he was out of the loop and wanted to know if the rumour was true. He'd heard that David Beckham had just made his DJ debut at the vast Sanctuary club in Milton Keynes. And that he'd been taking lessons from Boy George and Brandon Block to prepare for the occasion. </p> <p>The images this conjured up were entertaining. Eighties pop queen Boy George playing records in the living room of the Beckhams' palace with David, while 90s pop queen Victoria danced around the sofa with little Brooklyn. Or Brandon Block - one of the UK's best party DJs - teaching David to lower his voice an octave and bellow 'Let's 'ave it!!!' over the mic any time the dance-floor action seemed to be slacking. It all seemed too good to be true. And, of course, it was. </p> <p>A quick call to his PR revealed that Beckham is not about to hang up his football boots and put on his dancing shoes. He didn't play at the Sanctuary, nor is he planning to. Once, when he and his wife visited the seminal garage club Twice As Nice with singer Dane Bowers, David stood in the DJ box with Bowers and messed about on the decks for a while. But apparently, this was a one-off jape. As for the private DJ lessons, Boy George found the idea hilarious. 'No, it's not true. I wish it was!' he laughed, adding mischievously that there was a lot he could do with a good-looking lad like Beckham in the back of a DJ booth. Brandon Block also denied ever mixing it up with the footballer, although he was enjoying being asked about it - it seems that half of British clubland had not only heard the story, but believed it. Only a few years ago, the idea of a sportsman of Beckham's stature playing records in a disco would have been absurd. Footballers frequently 'invested' in dodgy nightclubs, but they would no more play the music as work behind the bar. But now, everyone wants to be a DJ. Eric Cantona has been seen behind the decks in various clubs in mainland Europe, and Daniele Dichio sometimes DJed when he played for QPR. Boxer Nigel Benn has also tried his hand. Once sad trainspotter types with huge record collections who played the music at parties so that they didn't have to stand on their own in the kitchen all night, star DJs now tend to be cheerful jet-setter types with huge bank balances and crowds of eager fans clustered round them in the clubs. </p> <p>'Initially kids just wanted to be clubbers, to go out on a Friday and Saturday night and enjoy themselves,' says James Barton, a former DJ who now heads the Cream club empire. 'It wasn't until about 1994 that you'd see kids spending most of their night gawking at the DJ, just looking over the top of the decks, watching everything they do.' Now, it's hard for Barton to spend any time in a club without a CD being shoved into his hand showcasing the talents of yet another bedroom DJ. As for celebrities, in the mid-90s Cream let Liverpool goalkeeper David James play in the early evening warm-up slot a few times. 'He hounded us and hounded us. He did it because he genuinely liked music and he was interested in it.' </p> <p>Not everyone is as sincere. In a recent TV documentary following the fortunes of the Big Brother contestants since the end of the show, Thomas McDermott, the shy country boy from Omagh, was hanging out in south London - learning to be a DJ. Perhaps the weeks in the Big house changed him, for before he went in, Thomas gave the website a list of the music he liked: Alanis Morrisette, The Eagles, Queen, John Lennon and Bryan Adams were the records rocking Tom's farmhouse. Among his hates: dance genres rap and jungle. </p> <p>Meanwhile, this month's Vogue shows that the fashion and society set have also succumbed to DJ fever. We see fashion designer Luella Bartley spinning the tunes at artist Marc Quinn's after-show party in London and Pulp's Jarvis Cocker playing at Miu Miu's fashion party in Paris. Photographer/designer/rich kid Dan Macmillan is behind the decks at a GQ magazine party, while GQ journalist Simon Mills lays down the beats for the DKNY and Bulgari parties. This outbreak of amateurism is all about prestige. Now that club culture has become big business, it's not hard to get a big club name to play your party - providing you can afford their massive fees. Getting famous friends to play instead is not about cash but connections: a currency that's crucial to the style set. So footballers wanting to score a turn on the decks should avoid the clubs and turn instead to cool parties: superclubs like Cream may not want them, but there's a fashion label somewhere just dying to hear their old funk records.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Anglo sparkles</strong><br> </p> <p> South African mining giant Anglo American, now a member of our very own FTSE-100 index, has enjoyed a strong run of late in the light of moves to unbundle its cross-holdings with diamond cartelier De Beers. </p> <p>Of course, there are whinges about the low value Anglo is placing on De Beers' core diamond business. But the Oppenheimer family, which runs both, will always attract controversy with whatever asset shuffle it performs next. The fact is there is only one (hard-nosed) buyer in town, and most of De Beers' investors will take profits and switch into Anglo shares. </p> <p>Anglo, of course, is helping the Oppenheimers to retain control of the diamond trade.

      "bodyText": "Anglo sparkles South African mining giant Anglo American, now a member of our very own FTSE-100 index, has enjoyed a strong run of late in the light of moves to unbundle its cross-holdings with diamond cartelier De Beers. Of course, there are whinges about the low value Anglo is placing on De Beers' core diamond business. But the Oppenheimer family, which runs both, will always attract controversy with whatever asset shuffle it performs next. The fact is there is only one (hard-nosed) buyer in town, and most of De Beers' investors will take profits and switch into Anglo shares. Anglo, of course, is helping the Oppenheimers to retain control of the diamond trade. But even though the \u00a312 billion bid may yet be sweetened (but only slightly), it looks cheap and therefore good for Anglo and its shareholders. The deal will free up a lot of Anglo shares previously held by De Beers. Fears of a huge stock overhang, however, look misplaced. Institutions have tended to be underweight in Anglo, including FTSE-100 tracker funds, and the smart money is on a buying squeeze which will give Anglo further impetus. Mining analyst Roger Chaplin at broker Cannacord Capital, for one, rates Anglo shares, at \u00a347, a buy. High St hesitation Whither Woolies? Amid a stream of speculation about sell-offs, the High Street chain's owner Kingfisher has yet to deliver on demerger plans announced as long ago as September. Since then, it has also been in talks to sell Woolworths and the chemists chain Superdrug to focus on DIY and electrical retailing. The gossip is that the group may pull the plug on Germany by spinning off Wegert, MakroMarkt and ProMarkt. Nothing, however, has seen the light of day and the shares, at 487p, have meandered. Broker Seymour Pierce believes that they are unlikely to break through the 500p barrier in the medium term and should be sold. Sour and sweet Is it time to buck the trend and develop a sweet tooth again? Given the turmoil at Tate &amp; Lyle in recent years, it would certainly be a leap of faith. One of the City's big sugar bears thinks that right now the risk might just be worth taking. After three years of prescient negative views on T&amp;L, broker Schroder Salomon Smith Barney has just changed its stance. This year, it suggests, will be pivotal for the group in its changing focus from sugar to starch. After flogging off all its other sugar assets, indeed, all that will be left of the original business will be T&amp;L UK. SSSB thinks that, with prices finally on the up, the worst is over for the starch industry. Furthermore, market expectations for T&amp;L are now so low that even the smallest piece of good news might spark a rally. The broker has now set a target price of 305p for the shares, against 260p now, and thinks T&amp;L will finally start to outperform the market. Healing power Take a look at Advanced Medical Solutions, the surgical-wound dressings group. Since coming to market in 1994, the company has consistently disappointed and is still making losses. House broker Granville Baird reveals that there has been takeover interest in the company and its technology. Fundamentally, too, with breakeven forecast for next year, it feels AMS has at last turned the corner. Buying the shares is clearly a risk. At 16.5p, however, the downside is limited as they are trading at below the value of the cash in the balance sheet and its accumulated tax losses.

However, for health service managers wanting to replace late Victorian monoliths with shiny new super-hospitals, the controversial initiative appears to be 'the only game in town'. </p> <p>And Milburn's recent announcement concerned not just an increase in the number of PFI hospitals, but a substantial expansion of their scope. </p> <p>Private sector involvement in the National Health Service in general has massively increased under this Government. Last week it was reported that NHS use of private beds has trebled since Alan Milburn signed a concordat with the private sector last October. The bill could reach some \u00a34bn over this year, from \u00a31.25bn last year. </p> <p>The PFI has invoked the greatest ire because its original rationale seemed to have been a wheeze to get vital public spending 'off-book'. It came in very handy during Labour's two-year departmental spending freeze. </p> <p>'We had to get the hospital building programme started. If you like...we had to create a market in PFI because there was not a market,' Milburn told the Health Select Committee in November last year. </p> <p>It's a fallacy to suggest, as many Cabinet ministers have, that PFI brings in extra investment from the private sector. That conclusion can only be reached because of the particular accounting methods used for public spending. On a theoretical, and increasingly on a practical level, PFI can only be justified if it garners private sector expertise and effort through appropriately allocating risks and rewards. </p> <p>At its heart is the idea of incentivisation, and allocation of risks to the bodies best capable of handling them. By specifying contracts in terms of outputs, for example the supply of a hospital premises, the public sector will benefit from the animal spirits of the profit-searching private sector. These urges constantly seek out innovative ways to economise, and so increase productivity, in the public sector. A flexible approach will help promote innovative responses to the challenge of the ageing population, for example. That's the theory anyway. The practice, so far, does not bear out this vision. </p> <p>Incentives have not been aligned as they might. There was the well-publicised finding that the first wave of PFI hospitals contained 30 per cent fewer hospital beds than had been planned in 1996. </p> <p>Last August The Observer revealed that Sir Stuart Lipton, the Government's 'design tsar' described PFI hospitals as disastrously poor 'urban disasters'. Far from being given more opportunity to innovate design to meet changing needs, the same pool of hospital architects is used, and consulted far less. </p> <p>Official evidence of savings from PFI depends heavily on conjecture about the value of 'risk transfer' and the notional value attached to the cost of providing the investment in the public sector - the Public Sector Comparator. Putting a value on risk transfer is tricky, but there is some evidence that the transfer is having some success. Most PFI hospitals are now coming in on schedule. </p> <p>However, many medical professionals claim that contracts are practically risk free. Hospital trusts would never be allowed to go bankrupt, so there is no risk to the consortiums' funds. The money markets appear to concur with this view: the rate at which they lend money to PFI initiative is falling towards the rate offered to government. </p> <p>Labour's favourite think-tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research, is finalising details of an 18-month Commission into PFI. </p> <p>Scant evidence of value for money over equivalent Exchequer-funded hospitals has been heard. Furthermore the extent of any savings are unlikely to exceed the millions spent on legal advice and consultancy. The devil is in the detail of the contracts rather than the introduction of PFI per se, according to one submission. For the latest tranche of projects, the Department of Health has guaranteed that bed numbers will not decrease. An emerging view, at least among think-tanks, is that PFI has not been given enough scope to prove its money saving credentials. Truly innovative private sector solutions require management over a wider scope of services, they say. Doing this provides incentives for intelligent use of the whole gamut of health services. </p> <p>Similarly, as health is a labour-intensive sector, true efficiency savings will only be seen when PFI's are in charge of a large proportion of NHS staff. Only 30 per cent of NHS costs come from the areas where PFI's are now operational. </p> <p>Milburn went some way down the first route with the announcement that third wave PFI hospitals will integrate primary and intermediate facilities in the local community 'to help ensure more seamless care for local patients'. </p> <p>But the Rubicon that is yet to be crossed is the provision of clinical services under PFI arrangements. It is being actively considered by the IPPR. But there was a concrete commitment to avoid it in Labour's last manifesto. </p> <p>Bringing together October's concordat, Labour's love affair with PFI, and the withdrawal of private health tax breaks, brings us to something approaching the Canadian health system.

The only way to acquit oneself with pride in the face of such lampooning is to get results. </p> <p>Marshall is absolutely clear about the task ahead of him, but not in a position to know whether he will get the chance to complete it - caught as he is in a fierce debate over whether he should be eclipsed by a new executive chairman for Railtrack. </p> <p>Railtrack wants a heavyweight non-executive chairman to work alongside Marshall, but the Government and the Strategic Rail Authority are reportedly demanding an executive chairman who would take control, shake up the company, wow the City, sort out the industry and cooperate with the regulators. </p> <p>If that happens in the next few weeks, Marshall is likely to be elbowed out of the limelight. For the public at large, he could sink without trace before even coming to any prominence. </p> <p>The jury is out both on the Government's ability to sort out the rail chaos and on Marshall's potential ability to rescue Railtrack from its status as a sick joke. But last week he was displaying a characteristically unpretentious and pragmatic approach. </p> <p>Sitting on a rail conference panel surrounded by his detractors from the Strategic Rail Authority, the banking community, train operator and passenger representative bodies and the safety authority, Marshall handed round mint imperials and grinned his cheeky-hamster grin, having obviously grasped that when you are in a crater as deep as Railtrack's, you should stop digging. </p> <p>'Awight!' said the Londoner and lifelong supporter of Brentford Football Club as he took the podium. 'Good afternoon everyone. I have got a few scribbled notes from the taxi, because I was not sure what I was being asked to talk about.' </p> <p>He then went on to admit that the privatisation of Railtrack had been deeply flawed, and that the company had been its own worst enemy ever since. </p> <p>'Railtrack has got to change materially. And it will [do that by] restoring engineering skills and focusing on customers - that is both passengers and train operators.' </p> <p>His grey suit matched his pallor after four months of round-the-clock crisis management since the Hatfield crash - part of a desperate bid to make up for six years of complacency following the company's creation. </p> <p>He spoke of his staff as 'a very tired bunch of people at this stage' - a state of body and mind instantly recognisable to train travellers up and down the land. </p> <p>And in the light of Railtrack's projected shortfall of \u00a32 billion in its revenues and its direct appeal to the Government for a bail-out, as revealed in The Observer last week, Marshall was candid about the 'predicament' his company faced and the need to find partners if it was to take on any new projects. </p> <p>'Railtrack should not be the only show in town. At the moment we are. And we are closed for business.' </p> <p>Whether Marshall will continue to be the ringmaster depends somewhat on whether the rail network is fixed by Easter - and on who fills the shoes of non-executive chairman Sir Philip Beck, the so-called 'Invisible Man', who has announced that he will leave the job this year. </p> <p>Marshall was virtually unknown when he arrived as finance director of Railtrack 16 months ago on a dizzying trajectory into the FTSE 100 from tiny Thorn plc. Thorn was the lacklustre nub of demerged Thorn EMI, which had Radio Rentals as the only jewel in its dubious diamante crown before Marshall sold it to Japanese bank Nomura in 1999. </p> <p>Then, to widespread surprise and bemusement, he was catapulted into the post of chief executive when Gerald Corbett resigned after admitting that a neglected, cracked rail had led to the Hatfield derailment, which killed four people. </p> <p>Opinions of Marshall are sharply divided. One City analyst said his 'wet fish' handshake gave the impression he was spineless but, in fact, this was 'not the case at all'. He described Marshall as an effective operator who was easily underestimated. </p> <p>Others were less complimentary. One said: 'Marshall does not have a glittering CV. In a company that needs the best management in the FTSE 100, I think Railtrack has the worst.' </p> <p>And despite the City's obsession with such financial technicalities as debt ratios, credit ratings, profit projections and earnings per share, it can be astoundingly bitchy about personal minutiae. </p> <p>Another particularly critical analyst said of Marshall last week: 'He has a constabulary manner, ponderous, like a plod on the beat. And he does not do well on television. He comes across as a chief accountant who has been over-promoted. ' </p> <p>Worse, he is regarded by many as a 'crony' of Corbett's because the two worked together at Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group that merged with Guinness to become Diageo. </p> <p>Many in the City thought Corbett arrived at Railtrack with a pretty poor track record as finance director of Grand Met and before that at construction group Redland. Any prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Corbett's is blighted, goes the argument. </p> <p>But former colleagues of Marshall have spoken out strongly in his defence. Sir George Bull, a previous chief executive of Grand Met and now non-executive chairman of Sainsbury, knew Marshall when he was at Grand Met between 1989 and 1995 as investor relations manager and later European finance director for wines and spirits. </p> <p>Bull said: 'He did a very, very good job and was highly regarded by the investment community. He was absolutely on top of the numbers and aware of all the issues and dealt with everything very constructively.' </p> <p>Another former colleague praised him as 'pragmatic and engaging, with a dry sense of humour'. </p> <p>He made much of Marshall's knack of making time to talk to people in a company, encouraging them to speak out without fear of blame, and his refusal to be 'precious' about sharing his knowledge - all of which has already been noted with appreciation in the battered ranks at Railtrack. </p> <p>But is that enough in what has been called the toughest job in Britain - a job that demands not just pragmatism and humility but a hefty dose of brilliance and charisma? </p> <p>The bloke from West London, who left Isleworth Grammar School at 18 and went straight into accountancy in order to earn money to support his family, will soon be judged in the harsh court of passenger satisfaction, government approval and City scepticism. </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong><br><strong> Subject: </strong> Steven Marshall </p> <p><strong> Born: </strong> 11 February 1957 </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> Chief executive, Railtrack </p> <p><strong> Other Directorships: </strong> None </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Supporting Brentford Football Club</p>",

Sitting on a rail conference panel surrounded by his detractors from the Strategic Rail Authority, the banking community, train operator and passenger representative bodies and the safety authority, Marshall handed round mint imperials and grinned his cheeky-hamster grin, having obviously grasped that when you are in a crater as deep as Railtrack's, you should stop digging. 'Awight!' said the Londoner and lifelong supporter of Brentford Football Club as he took the podium. 'Good afternoon everyone. I have got a few scribbled notes from the taxi, because I was not sure what I was being asked to talk about.' He then went on to admit that the privatisation of Railtrack had been deeply flawed, and that the company had been its own worst enemy ever since. 'Railtrack has got to change materially. And it will [do that by] restoring engineering skills and focusing on customers - that is both passengers and train operators.' His grey suit matched his pallor after four months of round-the-clock crisis management since the Hatfield crash - part of a desperate bid to make up for six years of complacency following the company's creation. He spoke of his staff as 'a very tired bunch of people at this stage' - a state of body and mind instantly recognisable to train travellers up and down the land. And in the light of Railtrack's projected shortfall of \u00a32 billion in its revenues and its direct appeal to the Government for a bail-out, as revealed in The Observer last week, Marshall was candid about the 'predicament' his company faced and the need to find partners if it was to take on any new projects. 'Railtrack should not be the only show in town. At the moment we are. And we are closed for business.' Whether Marshall will continue to be the ringmaster depends somewhat on whether the rail network is fixed by Easter - and on who fills the shoes of non-executive chairman Sir Philip Beck, the so-called 'Invisible Man', who has announced that he will leave the job this year. Marshall was virtually unknown when he arrived as finance director of Railtrack 16 months ago on a dizzying trajectory into the FTSE 100 from tiny Thorn plc. Thorn was the lacklustre nub of demerged Thorn EMI, which had Radio Rentals as the only jewel in its dubious diamante crown before Marshall sold it to Japanese bank Nomura in 1999. Then, to widespread surprise and bemusement, he was catapulted into the post of chief executive when Gerald Corbett resigned after admitting that a neglected, cracked rail had led to the Hatfield derailment, which killed four people. Opinions of Marshall are sharply divided. One City analyst said his 'wet fish' handshake gave the impression he was spineless but, in fact, this was 'not the case at all'. He described Marshall as an effective operator who was easily underestimated. Others were less complimentary. One said: 'Marshall does not have a glittering CV. In a company that needs the best management in the FTSE 100, I think Railtrack has the worst.' And despite the City's obsession with such financial technicalities as debt ratios, credit ratings, profit projections and earnings per share, it can be astoundingly bitchy about personal minutiae. Another particularly critical analyst said of Marshall last week: 'He has a constabulary manner, ponderous, like a plod on the beat. And he does not do well on television. He comes across as a chief accountant who has been over-promoted. ' Worse, he is regarded by many as a 'crony' of Corbett's because the two worked together at Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group that merged with Guinness to become Diageo. Many in the City thought Corbett arrived at Railtrack with a pretty poor track record as finance director of Grand Met and before that at construction group Redland. Any prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Corbett's is blighted, goes the argument. But former colleagues of Marshall have spoken out strongly in his defence. Sir George Bull, a previous chief executive of Grand Met and now non-executive chairman of Sainsbury, knew Marshall when he was at Grand Met between 1989 and 1995 as investor relations manager and later European finance director for wines and spirits. Bull said: 'He did a very, very good job and was highly regarded by the investment community. He was absolutely on top of the numbers and aware of all the issues and dealt with everything very constructively.' Another former colleague praised him as 'pragmatic and engaging, with a dry sense of humour'. He made much of Marshall's knack of making time to talk to people in a company, encouraging them to speak out without fear of blame, and his refusal to be 'precious' about sharing his knowledge - all of which has already been noted with appreciation in the battered ranks at Railtrack. But is that enough in what has been called the toughest job in Britain - a job that demands not just pragmatism and humility but a hefty dose of brilliance and charisma? The bloke from West London, who left Isleworth Grammar School at 18 and went straight into accountancy in order to earn money to support his family, will soon be judged in the harsh court of passenger satisfaction, government approval and City scepticism.

All at the click of a mouse, within the hour and at any time of day. </p> <p>For the ferociously impatient or, let's face it, the feckless, it was manna from heaven, or at least from a moped driven by a struggling student. For the sceptics it was one of the most blatant examples of a dotcom business strategy that evolved despite the lack of a credible strategy, although, of course, this didn't stop investors stumping up millions of pounds to back them. </p> <p>Very, very quickly each e-mmediacy firm realised that just because it had a website didn't mean it had a business. Fulfilment was everything and few firms managed to meet consumers' expectations at anything like a satisfactory level. </p> <p>The fact that most firms decided to focus on launching in London, because of its obvious wealth and 24-hour lifestyle, actually may have been a mistake </p> <p>'To break through in London amidst all that clutter costs a fortune,' said Jonathan Kerr, marketing director with www.in60.com, an e-mmediator that operates in Edinburgh and Glasgow. </p> <p>First to bite the bullet was the inappropriately titled BagsofTime.com, which announced, on Friday 13 October last year, six months after it started, that it was closing down. </p> <p>In a portentous statement on its website after it shut up shop, the company, backed by former News Corporation executive Bob Hitching, stated: 'We ... failed to distinguish our same-day workplace delivery model clearly enough from others in the 'rapid delivery' market that requires a significantly larger investment to concentrate on 60-minute delivery to individual consumers at home'. Which was grammatically challenged shorthand for: we didn't have the cash to hire enough couriers to deliver within the hour, despite giving the impression that's what we were doing. </p> <p>But at least the guys behind BagsofTime had a sense of humour. As it went belly up after failing to secure a further \u00a33 million in funding, the company - like so many other dotcoms which seemingly managed to announce a new business strategy overnight - said it, too, was switching models: from a business to consumer (B2C) model to a 'B2R' strategy. </p> <p>As Bags' website explained: 'Now that we have bags of time on our hands, we intend to concentrate on a brief B2R (beach-to-recuperate) strategy, somewhere hot.' This turned out to be Cuba, apparently. </p> <p>But on the same day that Bags was calling time, New York-based Urban Fetch announced it was winding up its four-month-old operation in London, a move that resulted in the loss of 100 jobs. The move surprised some because if any company should have managed to provide near instant online gratification to the masses, Fetch looked up to the task, if only because of its very deep pockets. </p> <p>The company was one of the biggest e-mmediators in the game, rivalled only by Kozmo, which operates in nine US cities. Fetch's London operation delivered everything from pastries baked in Terence Conran's Bluebird restaurant to books. But like many dotcom firms, Fetch found it difficult to keep a lid on its profligacy. The parent company burned through $70 million in 12 months and as a result closed down all of its e-mmediacy operations to focus on providing a standard courier service to US companies. </p> <p>Needless to say, this rankled with those who worked for the London operation, which seemed to be meeting its targets. Sales had been doubling week-on-week and the company was due to turn profitable by the end of this year. But the parent company failed to secure a further \u00a315 million cash injection and the UK employees were left feeling deeply angry at the way they had been treated. </p> <p>Then there was the ill-fated attempt to break into London by the abstrusely named and Paris-based Koobuycity.com. The company, which employed 50 people in France and 15 in the UK, raised nearly \u00a32 million to fund its expansion plans but its attempts to make a success of it in the capital were thwarted by the most elementary of problems: its website didn't work. Visitors to the site in search of late-night sustenance were greeted with the words: 'Darnit Koobuycity is offline'. That was back in October, just two months after the company launched in the UK. Then the company failed to secure third-round financing as the dotcom climate worsened on the back of successive slumps on the Nasdaq and the operation was pulled completely. </p> <p>As the backlash against the e-mmediators reached new heights, other firms, like ziparound.com, were stillborn. The company was due to launch in the summer of last year in London and one other, as then, yet to be decided city. But ziparound never got off the ground and, like Koobuy, its defunct website floats listlessly in cyberspace. </p> <p>And now, at the end of this week, London's last e-mmediator, ZapitOver, will shut up shop having conducted a fire sale. Ironically, the company reports that, during the last few days, demand for its services has soared. 'It just goes to show everyone is price-sensitive,' said Will Sankey, Managing Director of 86 Ltd, the internet incubator behind ZapitOver. </p> <p>The company, whose management injected \u00a3250,000 in capital to get it up and running, suffered from the fact that it was initially called WapitOver, which led some potential customers to believe that the service was available only on mobile phones. </p> <p>Nevertheless it was able to run on a shoestring and the 15-strong operation needed to hit only 100 deliveries a day to have a sustainable business plan, compared with the whopping 4,000 Urban Fetch London needed to keep afloat. </p> <p>On a good day, like Valentine's Day, ZapitOver was taking \u00a32,000 worth of orders. But unfortunately the bad days, when it would take as little as \u00a3300, came around too frequently. </p> <p>If it could have stayed alive a little longer, ZapitOver might have been a success. There were deals in the pipeline with mobile phone companies Orange and BT Cellnet and the company's incipient success had been achieved without any advertising. </p> <p>Sankey said: 'There is a market for instant gratification.

US legal war that pulled the plug The problems facing the UK's e-mmediators when it came to securing new funding in recent months might not have been so acute had it not been for the bitter spat between the US's two leading firms, Urban Fetch and Kozmo. The story starts a couple of years ago, when the management team behind Kozmo approached venture firm Integrity Capital for funding. Integrity was impressed with Kozmo's business plan. So impressed, in fact, that it decided not to fund the company but back a start-up rival, Urban Fetch, instead. Kozmo subsequently sued Fetch for allegedly copying its model. Fetch counter-sued, arguing Kozmo's legal action had helped turn off the tap on further funding. The case was settled out of court and the two sides proceeded to engage in a vicious and mutually damaging price war. Partly as a result, Kozmo was forced to pull its flotation and cut more than 10 per cent of its near-3,500 staff.

      "body": "<p>Madelaine Vionnet, the great French fashion designer and self-proclaimed 'physician of the figure', would be appalled. She probably wouldn't even recognise the industry she helped make famous more than 100 years ago. Whereas at the turn of the last century haute couture was the epitome of style, sophistication and subtlety, today the industry seems hellbent on shocking the beau monde in the front rows at the world's leading fashion shows. </p> <p>At times over the past seven days the catwalk at London Fashion week seemed to stretch out of a deeply tortured soul. Grotesque characters - giant nodding babies and cobwebbed toy soldiers - provided the backdrop for Alexander McQueen's latest outlandish collection, unveiled last Wednesday. The models themselves had replica skeletons manacled to their ankles. But, then, ever since his first collection was unveiled in a disused synagogue five years ago, McQueen has enjoyed a reputation for shocking: he has become the most terrible of terrible infants. His shows reportedly cost more than \u00a31 million to put on. </p> <p>The headlines are not just good news for the Scottish designer. They also draw broad smiles from the big pension funds and other investors who own shares in Gucci, the $10 billion fashion empire that is listed on both New York and Amsterdam stock exchanges and owns a majority stake in McQueen's label. </p> <p>Despite haute couture's reputation for daring and innovation, behind most creative geniuses there lurks a hulking plc responsible to risk-averse shareholders - a fact designers prefer to ignore but one that is increasingly important as an unprecedented wave of consolidation sweeps through the fashion world. </p> <p>If it isn't Stella McCartney designing for Chloe, the label owned by Swiss giant Richemont, it's John Galliano at Christian Dior, part of LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods firm. Keeping Galliano company at LVMH are Karl Lagerfield, who designs for Fendi, which is 25 per cent owned by the French firm, and Marc Jacobs, the designer charged with introducing a clothing range at Louis Vuitton. Donna Karan recently sold out to LVMH, too. </p> <p>Then there's Jean Paul Gaultier ending up at Hermes, while Jil Sander fell to Prada. Even the high priest of high fashion, Yves Saint Laurent, sold his ready- to-wear label to Gucci - which is now eyeing leading Parisian firm Balenciaga. Even two designers who claim to be independent - Ben De Lisi and Hussein Chalayan (whose company recently filed for bankruptcy) - have signed up to design for Debenhams and Marks &amp; Spencer respectively. </p> <p>But then, nobody buys haute couture any more, and the industry loses millions of pounds every year. When Vionnet was cutting her cloth 100 years ago there were 35,000 people working in haute couture in Paris alone. Today there are fewer than 5,000 and the French industry boasts turnover of a measly $1 billion a year. </p> <p>But this, of course, is to miss the point. High fashion may be as flimsy as a wisp of chiffon - Givenchy and Christian Lacroix are loss-making parts of the LVMH empire, as is Thierry Mugler at Clarins - but the spin-off benefits for parent companies are enormous. </p> <p>'It's the fashion houses' single most important marketing tool,' says Anne-Catherine Galetic, luxury goods analyst with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. 'Look at Bernard Arnault [the legendary head of LVMH and one of France's richest men]. His objective is to let the designer make noise.' </p> <p>The noise attracts attention, and the attention is turned into hard cash, as eager consumers queue up to buy the ready-to-wear versions or accessories sold under the haute couture brand. </p> <p>'It used to be in perfume where the money was. But there's been intense competition [more than 100 new perfumes are launched every year] and the costs of marketing perfume are really high. Now the real money is to be made leather goods,' says Galetic. </p> <p>The fashion houses believe there is more money around simply because the rich are getting richer. According to a report from Gemini Consulting, the total wealth held by high-net-worth individuals - with $1 million or more of assets - grew by 18 per cent in 1999 and is expected to grow at an average rate of 12 per cent over the next five years. Great news for the big fashion houses, whose products command fat margins thanks to their luxury status. </p> <p>The rush to cash in on these lucrative demographics has triggered a bitter turf war between big fashion firms as they look to buy up designers to diversify their portfolios. This helps them insure against the caprice of fashion by spreading the risks associated with being dependent on just one or two labels. </p> <p>As the fashion industry becomes ever more globalised, the top designers face a stark choice. 'If you want to market globally, you have to put a lot of money on the table,' Galetic says. 'There's a huge need for capital, which you don't easily find as a small company.' </p> <p>The smaller fashion houses simply don't have the expertise or distribution networks needed to sell their designs. One of the reasons Donna Karan decided to sell to LVMH was that most of her outlet stores were losing money. </p> <p>The big luxury goods companies floated on the stock markets have benefited from the fact that over the past two years their sector has tended to outperform the market, and this has increased their ability to use their own paper to fund deals. </p> <p>The feeding frenzy has sparked extraordinary feuds. LVMH turned on Gucci two years ago, gobbling up a 20 per cent stake. Terrified of falling into Arnault's hands, Gucci sought protection from Arnault's bitterest rival, Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, whose \u00a313 billion Pinault Printemps Redoute (PPR) conglomerate owns everything from department stores to record chains. PPR now owns 43 per cent of Gucci and, in a further coup, went on to snaffle McQueen away from LVMH, where he was chief designer for Givenchy. The battle for control of a firm started by one Guccio Gucci as a saddlery shop in Florence nearly 100 years ago is being fought out between LVMH and PPR in the Amsterdam courts. </p> <p>Examples of top designers resisting the consolidation trend are few and far between. Donna Karan, who vowed her company would stay independent, sold up when the firm took a mauling on Wall Street. Giorgio Armani has insisted he will stay independent, but he may yet be forced to change his mind. </p> <p>But the big fish of the fashion world could regret their rush to gobble up the smaller prey. Analysts have started to question the rationale behind some of the deals the firms have done. The worry is that they overpaid for the brands and this has had an impact on their earnings. </p> <p>As a recent Schroder Salomon Smith Barney report noted about Gucci: 'We remain concerned about possible delays in the restructuring of YSL [and] the risk of further dilution from additional acquisitions.' Even Gucci's management had to concede recently that the investment required to turn around Yves St Laurent would be heavier than initially forecast. </p> <p>This should not come as a surprise. After all, the firms have bought little more than a trademark plus some creativity. And there's no guarantee that creativity can be harnessed effectively by the big parent companies. Jil Sander has received some damning reviews since it fell under Prada's ownership. McQueen stormed out of LVMH because he felt his creativity was being stifled at Givenchy. </p> <p>Hop back five years and the likes of Gucci didn't have to work so hard to make their money go further. Gucci, then a single-brand company, was enjoying a return on its investment capital close to 70 per cent. Effectively it was a big marketing machine for Gucci clothing. Now, thanks to its recent shopping spree, the firm can expect a return of only 10 to 12 per cent on its capital outlay as it focuses on developing new brands. </p> <p>The promise is of jam tomorrow, once the giant fashion houses have fitted their new acquisitions snugly into their distribution and marketing machines, turning the brands from niche to global players. The logic for this is impeccable in a booming market. But with a faltering US economy, the fashion industry looks more vulnerable than most other sectors to taking a big hit. </p> <p>Coming out of the Asia crisis of 1997-98 the sector was delivering double-digit growth. But by the fourth quarter of last year, growth in the sector had slipped to 2 per cent, in line with the European market as a whole. </p> <p>Now Italian fashion giant Prada may push back its estimated $7 billion flotation on the Italian stock market. According to City sources, the company is thought to be having second thoughts because of the shift in market sentiment. </p> <p>Market sentiment won't have been cheered by the performance of Donna Karan, which listed on the New York stock exchange five years ago with a share price of $24 but sold out to LVMH at $8.50 a pop last month. </p> <p>The smaller fashion firms could soon find it more difficult to stay independent. Analysts predict there will be further activity in the coming months. Whether shareholders will benefit from the fashion to consolidation is another matter.

Wednesday 7 March was simply not on the lips of even the greatest forecasters. </p> <p>Diana Boulter of DBA Speakers, which supplies business speakers to corporate clients, complained: 'Many of our clients are leading accountancy and tax firms. Has the Government any idea how much it costs firms who plan events around the Budget only to find that they have to pay out for venues which are unused owing to the late announcement of the date?' </p> <p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants is also up in arms. Francesca Lagerberg, senior technical manager at the august institute's tax faculty, says: 'This has inconvenienced quite a lot of City organisations which are not able to get their money back.' </p> <p>The time-honoured Political Economy Club, which had booked its traditional Budget Day dinner at the Reform Club, has had to move. </p> <p>The general view is that after years of wooing the 'prawn cocktail circuit' the Chancellor has become cavalier. (The circuit's value was previously questioned by the late John Smith, who commented after Labour lost the 1992 election: 'Never have so many thousands of crustaceans been eaten in vain.') </p> <p>But what riles City professionals is that for weeks the Government did nothing to counteract the assumption that the Budget would be on Tuesday 6 March. </p> <p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants goes so far as to say, 'scrap the Budget charade' on the grounds that 'there is no compelling need to make those changes all in one go every March.'</p>",

For many City people the only question was: would it be on Tuesday 6 March, or would it clash with Cheltenham and the Champion Hurdle on Tuesday 13 March. Wednesday 7 March was simply not on the lips of even the greatest forecasters. Diana Boulter of DBA Speakers, which supplies business speakers to corporate clients, complained: 'Many of our clients are leading accountancy and tax firms. Has the Government any idea how much it costs firms who plan events around the Budget only to find that they have to pay out for venues which are unused owing to the late announcement of the date?' The Institute of Chartered Accountants is also up in arms. Francesca Lagerberg, senior technical manager at the august institute's tax faculty, says: 'This has inconvenienced quite a lot of City organisations which are not able to get their money back.' The time-honoured Political Economy Club, which had booked its traditional Budget Day dinner at the Reform Club, has had to move. The general view is that after years of wooing the 'prawn cocktail circuit' the Chancellor has become cavalier. (The circuit's value was previously questioned by the late John Smith, who commented after Labour lost the 1992 election: 'Never have so many thousands of crustaceans been eaten in vain.') But what riles City professionals is that for weeks the Government did nothing to counteract the assumption that the Budget would be on Tuesday 6 March. The Institute of Chartered Accountants goes so far as to say, 'scrap the Budget charade' on the grounds that 'there is no compelling need to make those changes all in one go every March.'",

      "body": "<p>It is the kind of spat we all love. Hermes, one of Britain's most aggressive investors, has taken up arms against one of its most venerable institutions, the investment trust sector, accusing it of cosiness and complacency.</p> <p>The ostensible target of Hermes' wrath is Scottish Investment Trust, which it accuses of not playing fair over a share buy-back.</p> <p>The story is simple enough. Last summer, US investment house Sierra Trading bought stakes in seven of our biggest investment trusts, including Foreign &amp; Colonial, Bankers, Monks and Murray International, as well as Scottish itself. The stakes were not universally welcomed: Sierra is a vulture fund, which means it acquires stakes in companies it thinks are performing badly and agitates for action to improve things.</p> <p>Sure enough, within months Sierra was pressing for action: specifically, it was asking the trusts to buy back as much as 70 per cent of their shares. Not surprisingly, the trusts were not enthusiastic. They did not want to conduct such large buy-backs, but they were even less keen to go to the expense of putting the resolutions to their shareholders. They all came up with the same solution: they bought back Sierra's shares.</p> <p>Six of the trusts offered other shareholders the chance to sell their stakes at the same price. Scottish, however, limited this to 30 per cent of the stakes, while buying back all of Sierra's shares. A furious Hermes accused Sierra of greenmailing - a US practice in which investors take a stake in a company then threatens it with takeover or other disruption unless they are bought out at a profit - and Scottish of encouraging this practice. Both Sierra and Scottish deny any wrongdoing, but Hermes is taking its protest to the trust's annual meeting.</p> <p>Behind the dispute, however, lies the thorniest problem of the investment trust sector: the discount. Unlike unit trusts, investment trusts are companies.</p> <p>When you buy into one, you are buying a share whose price depends not just on what it owns but on what investors think of its prospects. </p> <p>For decades, the share price of average investment trusts has been below the value of their assets - indeed, a year ago the discount stood at 18 per cent, not far off the all-time high. That makes them a great target for arbitrageurs: if agitating for change fails, they can simply ask for the company to be wound up, and the assets should fetch more than the share price.</p> <p>Discounts have fallen sharply in the past 12 months: the average is now less than 10 per cent. But that is not just due to the activities of companies such as Sierra Trading - indeed some would say none of it is due to vulture funds, but instead to three key factors.</p> <p>First, and most important in the long term, investment trusts' performance has improved. After years of pedestrian results, last year saw many funds - including lumbering generalists such as Foreign &amp; Colonial - beat their rivals. That has made institutional investors, who still hold the majority of investment trust shares, happier to have them in their portfolios.</p> <p>Secondly, those that still want to sell out, better performance or not, have had a good chance of an exit. Changes to the tax rules mean that investment trusts can now easily buy back their shares, and many have: Merrill Lynch puts the total at \u00a33.5 billion.</p> <p>The way in which Scottish conducted its buy-back may have enraged Hermes, but most good investment trust managers keep them as a weapon to use whenever their discounts start to get too wide.</p> <p>The third factor is advertising. The Association of Investment Trust Companies, the industry's organisation, has just launched a second round of advertising aimed at promoting investment trusts as a savings product. Many have scoffed at the campaign - and the current one, which involves a women foregoing romance to rush off and buy an investment trust, is rather bizarre - but AITC director general Daniel Godfrey thinks it has been successful.</p> <p>He points out that sales of trusts in 'wrapper' products, such as Isas and pensions, doubled last year; sales of other products rose by just 30 per cent.</p> <p>Advertising may help generate interest in trusts, but the only thing that will keep that interest up is performance. The activities of Sierra Trading should leave managers in no doubt that the vulture funds are quick to target anyone who puts in a lacklustre performance.</p> <p>Private investors, too, should be looking for good performance, but they do not need to be too concerned about the discount. </p> <p>Investment trusts offer some of the best and cheapest ways of saving there are - Alliance Trust, for example, has an expense ratio of less than 0.2 per cent. Many others are only a little more expensive - and that is all that someone saving through its saving scheme will pay. Most unit trusts will charge an annual management fee of at least 1 per cent. That lower charge makes up for a lot of movement in the discount.</p>",

The stakes were not universally welcomed: Sierra is a vulture fund, which means it acquires stakes in companies it thinks are performing badly and agitates for action to improve things. Sure enough, within months Sierra was pressing for action: specifically, it was asking the trusts to buy back as much as 70 per cent of their shares. Not surprisingly, the trusts were not enthusiastic. They did not want to conduct such large buy-backs, but they were even less keen to go to the expense of putting the resolutions to their shareholders. They all came up with the same solution: they bought back Sierra's shares. Six of the trusts offered other shareholders the chance to sell their stakes at the same price. Scottish, however, limited this to 30 per cent of the stakes, while buying back all of Sierra's shares. A furious Hermes accused Sierra of greenmailing - a US practice in which investors take a stake in a company then threatens it with takeover or other disruption unless they are bought out at a profit - and Scottish of encouraging this practice. Both Sierra and Scottish deny any wrongdoing, but Hermes is taking its protest to the trust's annual meeting. Behind the dispute, however, lies the thorniest problem of the investment trust sector: the discount. Unlike unit trusts, investment trusts are companies. When you buy into one, you are buying a share whose price depends not just on what it owns but on what investors think of its prospects. For decades, the share price of average investment trusts has been below the value of their assets - indeed, a year ago the discount stood at 18 per cent, not far off the all-time high. That makes them a great target for arbitrageurs: if agitating for change fails, they can simply ask for the company to be wound up, and the assets should fetch more than the share price. Discounts have fallen sharply in the past 12 months: the average is now less than 10 per cent. But that is not just due to the activities of companies such as Sierra Trading - indeed some would say none of it is due to vulture funds, but instead to three key factors. First, and most important in the long term, investment trusts' performance has improved. After years of pedestrian results, last year saw many funds - including lumbering generalists such as Foreign &amp; Colonial - beat their rivals. That has made institutional investors, who still hold the majority of investment trust shares, happier to have them in their portfolios. Secondly, those that still want to sell out, better performance or not, have had a good chance of an exit. Changes to the tax rules mean that investment trusts can now easily buy back their shares, and many have: Merrill Lynch puts the total at \u00a33.5 billion. The way in which Scottish conducted its buy-back may have enraged Hermes, but most good investment trust managers keep them as a weapon to use whenever their discounts start to get too wide. The third factor is advertising. The Association of Investment Trust Companies, the industry's organisation, has just launched a second round of advertising aimed at promoting investment trusts as a savings product. Many have scoffed at the campaign - and the current one, which involves a women foregoing romance to rush off and buy an investment trust, is rather bizarre - but AITC director general Daniel Godfrey thinks it has been successful. He points out that sales of trusts in 'wrapper' products, such as Isas and pensions, doubled last year; sales of other products rose by just 30 per cent. Advertising may help generate interest in trusts, but the only thing that will keep that interest up is performance. The activities of Sierra Trading should leave managers in no doubt that the vulture funds are quick to target anyone who puts in a lacklustre performance. Private investors, too, should be looking for good performance, but they do not need to be too concerned about the discount. Investment trusts offer some of the best and cheapest ways of saving there are - Alliance Trust, for example, has an expense ratio of less than 0.2 per cent. Many others are only a little more expensive - and that is all that someone saving through its saving scheme will pay. Most unit trusts will charge an annual management fee of at least 1 per cent. That lower charge makes up for a lot of movement in the discount.",

      "bodyText": "If you are thinking of buying an Isa on the basis of the bumper returns highlighted in an advertisement, don't take the claims at face value. Scottish Widows, for example, promotes its European Isa by saying its underlying trust has achieved 'highly attractive average returns of 18.4 per cent since its launch in 1986'. It goes on to say: 'Had you invested \u00a37,000 in the trust at launch, your savings would now be worth \u00a382,390.' This performance puts the Scottish Widows European Trust second out of 28 unit trusts in the European sector over the period according to figures by Standard &amp; Poor's Micropol. However, over five years, the S&amp;P figures tell a different story, with the trust managing to scrape in at just 33 out of 82 unit trusts, the lesson being that an average headline rate in an advert tells you nothing about how the trust will fare from one year to the next. 'Past performance is no reliable gauge for future performance,' says the Financial Services Authority, the City's regulator. The top-performing Isas one year often become the next year's losers, according to independent financial adviser Chase de Vere. The Bath-based company says you should look for an Isa with a consistently good performance. \u0095 Seen an offer or advertisement that sounds too good to be true?

This winter, for the first time in 20 years, it was seriously flooded. Says Doreen: 'We lost all our downstairs furniture. Books and records were under three feet of water. All the plaster and woodwork was damaged, and we lost our Raeburn, which was only a month old.' </p> <p>Six weeks later, as they were getting straight, water again rose through the floorboards. 'A replacement Raeburn was installed on the Thursday; on Friday morning we called the installers to raise it on blocks before we were flooded again.' </p> <p>They are now living in temporary accommodation with their four children - Tom, 25, Daisy, 22 and in her final year at university, Jack, 16 and at sixth-form college, and Sam, three. They will not be back in their home until nearer the summer. Doreen has developed a flood phobia: 'I can't bear to go back to the house to see the damage.' </p> <p>Selling the house is not an option: 'Just before it flooded it was valued at \u00a3250,000. After the second flood, one agent said it was worth about \u00a3180,000; another would not even put it on the market. We are going to have to stay, and may need to spend thousands on flood prevention.' </p> <p>The stress has affected Rob's health. He had a heart attack last year and had recovered but, following the flood, had to take a month off on half pay. They have life insurance and mortgage protection insurance, but no critical illness cover. </p> <p>Doreen had not realised how bad their financial situation was until she looked at the figures for Wealthcheck: 'I found this exercise extremely depressing: I had no real idea of the extent of our debts and the shortfall between income and outgoings.' She could not work out why they were constantly overdrawn: 'I realised we had not taken account of Sam's nursery fees.' They recently discovered that their endowment mortgage is underperforming: 'We find it hard to believe that, at present, it will not even pay out the amount we have paid in.' </p> <p>Their lifeline is Doreen's inheritance: 'I have about \u00a360,000, which is in a build ing society as I don't know what to do with it. We need to provide for Jack's and Sam's university education but it would need to be tied up securely so I can't touch it.' </p> <p>They have considered buying a house to let: 'We thought this would stop us getting through this money too quickly and also increase our income while keeping the capital safe.'</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Chris Elsey</strong></p> <p>Doreen and Rob should use the inheritance to improve their situation which should, in the long run, provide more money for the children. They should repay debts, put money aside for mortgage payments if Rob is on half pay, set up an emergency cash reserve of \u00a310,000, and earmark money for flood prevention work. </p> <p>To overcome the potential endowment shortfall, they can repay part of the mortgage, increase the repayment element, or just keep money aside.</p> <p>They could switch to a more competitive mortgage deal, but may have a problem as lenders can insist that a property is habitable first.</p> <p>It is important to maintain the joint life policies; they should consider more, although underwriters will load the premiums for Rob. At least while Daisy is still dependent they should have \u00a315,000 a year more insurance. This could be family income benefit on Doreen's life in trust for Rob at \u00a317 a month. They should consider adding critical illness cover, although a joint-life first-death policy may be expensive given Rob's health.</p> <p>They should set aside about \u00a35,000 to help Jack through university. I suggest either a two-year National Savings Certificate, perhaps index-linked, or a high-interest postal account. At 16, Jack can have a Mini Cash Isa in his own name from next April. </p> <p>Chris Elsey works for Sedgwick Independent Financial Consultants.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Julie Lord </strong></p> <p>Rob's ill health is clearly limiting his earning ability, and their resources are such that they cannot risk Doreen's earning ability being curtailed. They must consider protecting at least Daisy, Jack and Sam's education, so Doreen should take out critical illness and income protection. This should be for at least the cost of the children's education plus perhaps the cost of five years' nursing care and lost income. It is unlikely that Rob will be able to get insurance given his health problems. </p> <p>Their total cash assets will be \u00a373,000. I have no hesitation in saying they should pay off all of their debts immediately. They should spend some money on flood prevention measures to build up the value of their property again and should repay as much of their mortgage as possible.</p> <p>Once they have paid off the mortgage, they could try to convert the endowment to term assurance, as Rob may need more life cover. Repaying their debts will save \u00a3600 a month, which could be used for the children's education and more insurance. Investing \u00a3500 a month can regenerate the \u00a360,000 inheritance long before they reach 60.</p> <p>Buying another house at the moment is a potential disaster as it just spreads their problems.

      "body": "<p>You spot a pretty period village property and fall in love with it. But would you be so keen to offer that high asking price if you knew it had been under several feet of water twice this winter? </p> <p>It is difficult to say what is happening to prices in areas that have been flooded, but experts are starting to form opinions. Alex Bannister of Nationwide building society, says: 'My gut feeling is that prices and sales in flooded areas will have been lower - and will be for some time.' The Halifax takes a similar stance. 'Prices have been fairly flat over the past few months,' says economist Martin Ellis. 'One of the reasons is that the bad weather has put some people off.' </p> <p>In York, a city which frequently featured in flood bulletins, Bryan Jaram of estate agent Jackson-Stops Staff, is more positive than one might expect. 'York floods far less often than it did 10 years ago when the flood prevention barriers were put in. For homes which flooded recently, people who want to sell will have to get their properties back into a liveable condition and then be prepared to wait and see.' For the most part, he says, a shortage of properties is pushing up prices. </p> <p>Neither Halifax nor Nationwide produces house price statistics in a form which allows analysis on a small enough scale to look at individual towns or villages. Figures available now are not easy to interpret. But the Nationwide has statistics which suggest that price rises in the East Sussex borough of Wealdon - which included the repeatedly flooded town of Uckfield - slowed dramatically in the last quarter of last year, from a very strong 33 per cent growth in the third quarter to 14 per cent. By contrast, national growth went from 12 to 9 per cent in that time, according to Nationwide. More detailed figures from the Land Registry, due on Wednesday, may give more reliable clues. </p> <p>The Portman building society also conducts house price surveys covering the southern half of England. Senior valuer Richard Atkinson has not yet seen patterns in the figures but says: 'The key is insurance. If insurers will insure, lenders will lend and properties will be saleable. If insurers won't, there is a problem.' </p> <p>For its part, the British Insurance Brokers Association (Biba) insists homeowners will still be able to get cover. But it accepts that premiums could go up. Since the flooding happened in the past six months, it is too early to get a full view of the response from the insurance industry. Their annual results are staggered throughout the calendar year. Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, however, has admitted that flooding claims have been twice what it initially expected - \u00a3200 million rather than \u00a3100m. Total costs for the industry could be upwards of \u00a31 billion - a very hefty sum, and one that will be passed on to policyholders. </p> <p>Biba estimates that householders will typically see \u00a310 added to premiums in the year. This increase typically equates to a 10 per cent increase in that part of the household pol icy which covers flood, storm and other catastrophes - a large increase. Homeowners whose properties have been flooded can expect bigger increases, says Biba technical director Peter Stadden. 'Whether there will be an increase on the excess is a different matter,' he says. Policies usually have a \u00a350 excess on that part of the policy. He thinks that could go up to \u00a3250. So, if you put your previously flooded house on the market, expect potential buyers to look very closely at insurance premiums and excess levels. </p> <p>In his valuations for the Portman, Atkinson pays particular attention to flood issues. 'We are certainly careful to look on the local authority searches to see if flooding is mentioned.' Some judgments are difficult to make. His team recently valued a property in the Chichester area where the house had not been flooded although the road had been sandbagged. The sandbags have kept the water away until now, but if the rain continues, more properties could experience the problem. </p> <p>Taking a more optimistic view than the Halifax, the Portman has seen a strong market so far in 2001. 'Prices peaked last Easter but are now moving forward again,' says Atkinson. 'And there has been an interest rate cut. This has probably saved the bacon of some people wanting to sell houses that have flooded. It's when the market goes quiet that problems could emerge.' He believes that, apart, perhaps, from homes which have been repeatedly flooded, 'properties will still sell' although the prices of some will probably decline. </p> <p>But there are still many variables which will affect prices of troubled properties - in particular, weather and politics. Another couple of weeks of rain could alter the picture again. But the real nasty would be a hot summer, says Brendan Doyle of homecheck.co.uk - a website visited by a million people in the past five months to get a free check of their property's susceptibility to flood. 'There will be awful problems if it is a hot summer. We are already seeing an increase in heave.' </p> <p>Heave is the opposite of subsidence: it leads to cracked walls when foundations built on bloated, waterlogged clay dry out and shrink back. It is just as expensive to deal with as subsidence and, like subsidence, takes months to monitor. The signs are similar too - frequently starting with cracks from window and door frames. Biba has already warned of an increase. </p> <p>Politically, there could also be developments. Some money has been promised by the Government to help clear up flood damage, but Biba has attacked the Government for doing too little, making a series of one-off payments without developing a committed strategy. Indeed, governments in most developed countries make available far more substantial sums of aid. The UK is unusual in treating the problem mainly as one for the private sector - for individuals and insurance companies. </p> <p>Homeowners in troubled areas who may want to sell in a year or two should read their local newspapers and keep abreast of discussions about flood defences. Most local authorities affected will be considering their options and reviewing the way they tackled the reecent crises. Some will already be building new protections. </p> <p>In some cases, local people may want to lobby for drainage systems to be improved. But one thing is sure. People buying properties are aware of the issue and are asking more questions. 'A lot of people are ringing up and asking if properties are flooded,' says Jaram of Jackson-Stops Staff in York. </p> <p>Detailed geological information was, until a few months ago, the province of insurers and geologists. But now companies such as Homecheck are making it easier for ordinary people to find information about any postcode - covering issues from flooding to land contamination to air quality. They are also asking conveyancing solicitors to do thorough checks. About 10,000 postcodes a week are checked by lawyers involved in conveyancing, according to Homecheck. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.homecheck.co.uk\">www.homecheck.co.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Moves by two of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders to reduce their standard variable interest rates have already posed a dilemma for borrowers. Is it better for borrowers to choose a consistently low standard variable rate, or a cheap discounted or fixed rate for a couple of years, followed by a higher SVR? </p> <p>The Nationwide said last week that it is cutting its SVR from 7.09 per cent to between 6.49 per cent and 6.69 per cent, depending on the size of deposit. The Halifax is cutting its SVR from 7.5 per cent to 6.75 per cent. A million homeowners stand to benefit from the reductions, although Halifax customers will have to apply for the cheaper rate. A borrower with a typical \u00a3100,000 interest-only mortgage at the Nationwide's 6.49 per cent rate will see monthly mortgage payments fall from \u00a3591 to \u00a3540, while a similar Halifax mortgage will fall from \u00a3625 to \u00a3562 a month. </p> <p>The Halifax is also introducing daily calculation of interest for borrowers on its new lower SVR, a move that should reduce the amount of interest paid throughout the term on repayment mortgages, while the Nationwide has decided to scrap its range of discounted and fixed-rate mortgages. It will replace these with just two 'budget option' fixed-rate loans. </p> <p>The changes will not affect borrowers already benefiting from discounted mortgages. The rates they are charged will continue to be linked to higher SVRs until their discounts expire (7.5 per cent for the Halifax and 6.99 per cent for the Nationwide). </p> <p>Both lenders claim their move is designed to change what they describe as a 'perverse' mortgage market where loyal existing customers pay a high SVR to subsidise new customers on low discounted deals. </p> <p>Jennifer Stoddart, a spokeswoman for the Nationwide, says: 'There will be no differential rates. All customers will be treated the same.' In a statement sent to journalists, the society has challenged other lenders, saying: 'Look after your borrowers or lose them.' </p> <p>But other lenders and mortgage brokers claim that the price war is phoney, designed to drum up publicity. Several lenders, including HSBC, Intelligent Finance, Standard Life Bank and Coventry Building Society, have pointed out that they already offer low SVRs for existing customers. </p> <p>Geoff Seymour, a spokesman for Alliance &amp; Leicester, believes both lenders have contributed to creating the price differential they are criticising by refusing in the past to allow existing customers to switch to their most competitive discounted and fixed rates. Halifax has recently restricted existing customers to a range of lacklustre tracker loans, while Nationwide, which has generally opted out of the remortgage market, offered an uncompetitive base-rate tracker or fixed-rate loan. In contrast, Alliance &amp; Leicester allows its customers to switch to any of the loans it offers. </p> <p>Seymour points out that new customers are very unlikely to opt for a lender's SVR: 'It's like going into a car show room, asking for the list price and getting your chequebook out.' </p> <p>The Nationwide argues that when choosing a loan, customers should not just look at the headline interest rate but also consider the total amount payable over the mortgage term and the annual percentage rate (APR). The APR includes the cost of the lender's SVR after any special deal expires, plus mortgage indemnity insurance and any other fees the borrower has to pay. The Nationwide compares well in these circumstances, even at its 6.69 per cent rate, costing \u00a3158,121 for a \u00a360,000 loan over a 25-year term, compared with \u00a3171,330 for a two-year discounted tracker from Abbey National, charging 5.74 per cent. </p> <p>But borrowers rarely keep the same mortgage for 25 years. Even if they don't remortgage, they are likely to move home during that period, and this will provide a good opportunity to look for a new, cheap loan and thereby cut the overall amount they pay. </p> <p>And brokers agree that even with the new lower rates offered by Nationwide and Halifax, existing borrowers will be better off shopping around for the best remortgage deals. </p> <p>David Hollingworth of Bath mortgage broker London &amp; Country says: 'While this is a concerted effort to keep customers, you can still do much better by switching to another lender.'</p> <p>He is sceptical about the claim that all of Halifax's SVR borrowers will benefit. 'Because the new lower rate will have interest calculated on a daily, rather than annual, basis, borrowers will have to apply for the rate. Those that have not bothered to remortgage to escape the current high SVR may not get around to applying for the lower rate either,' he says. </p> <p>Nationwide, which will not be able to offer daily interest calculation until the end of the year, will apply its new rates automatically to existing borrowers' accounts. </p> <p>Ray Boulger of London mortgage broker Charcol is scathing about Nationwide's budget option loans. These offer low discounted rates in the first two years - 5.29 per cent for option one and 5.89 per cent for option two - but much higher rates in the next three, ranging from 7.29 per cent to 7.49 per cent for option one, and 6.89 per cent to 7.09 per cent for option two, depending on the amount of equity in the property. </p> <p>Nationwide says these rates are designed to help borrowers out in the early years of buying a new home, when cashflow is tight, while charging the same amount of interest over the five years as the society's base rate. </p> <p>But Boulger says: 'They are essentially newer versions of the old-style discount products, which carry trailer penalties. Comparing this proposition with the rest of the market, borrowers would do better to shop around.' </p> <p>However, he believes the reduction in SVRs by these two big lenders will encourage other lenders to do the same: 'It's difficult to imagine that other lenders will not respond, and we expect the Halifax variable base rate to set a new benchmark which some other lenders will follow.'</p>",

But when share prices are falling - and the FTSE 100 last week dipped below 2000 for the first time since April 2000 - he has his supporters. 'Don't panic,' says Mike Warburton, senior tax partner at accountant Grant Thornton. 'In my view that's the worst thing you can do.' </p> <p>Of course, knowing what not to do is one thing, putting it into practice is much more difficult, especially when all about you are doing precisely the opposite. </p> <p>If you are investing for the long term, you have to keep your nerve when markets are falling. There is anecdotal evidence that small investors are less prone to panic now than in the late Eighties. Since many are investing long term, to build retirement funds, they are happy to hold on in the knowledge that prices should eventually recover. </p> <p>Warburton says it is essential that private investors are able to cope with the bad times. 'If you can't cope with falling prices, you shouldn't have bought in the first place.' </p> <p>Justin Sandler, investment manager at Eden Group, agrees: 'Everyone should have a clear strategy.' And even more so when selling at a loss because of the emotional baggage involved. 'It's an admission of failure. It's accepting, \"hey, I did it wrong\",' he says. </p> <p>John Leggett, a stock market investor from Surrey, says he has experienced that kind of feeling. 'I suffered the same problem,' he says. Unfortunately in Leggett's case the share that dropped the most was also the one he had most invested in. 'It lost 55 per cent of its value, and it has never recovered,' he says. </p> <p>Leggett says he continued to hold the share because it fell so quickly. However, he admits to another factor, which has influenced the unsatisfactory performance of two or three of his stocks. 'Sentiment has lost me lots of money,' he says. Such experiences forced him to come up with a strategy to deal with falling stock prices. </p> <p>Now, instead of waiting until they recover their value, he uses a mathematical formula which automatically tells him when to sell. 'The aim is to knock out the emotion, which affected my performance,' he says. Since he began using this approach, Leggett says, his overall performance has improved. </p> <p>Sandler also warns against the dangers of acting emotionally. He suggests investors set a stop-loss for their shares. This is a price at which investors decide, in advance, to sell a share, allowing them to set a cap on potential losses, he says. </p> <p>John Smith, head of investment strategy at Brown Shipley, says that choosing a strategy depends on the time- scale involved. 'Be patient,' he says. The stock market downturn in 1990 lasted only six months, he says, while even the more prolonged bear (falling) market of the Seventies dragged on for only five years. </p> <p>Colin Copeland, a private investor from Essex, agrees. 'The backbone of my portfolio are long-term buy and holds such as Baltimore or Emblaze Systems, which I just stick away,' he says. </p> <p>Smith adds: 'The market is 25 per cent reality and 75 per cent sentiment. It is important not to follow the herd. </p> <p>'Take Glaxo,' he continues. 'In retrospect it was wrong to sell it in 1987 unless you bought it back at a lower price - in which case you would have been substantially in the minority.' </p> <p>The key is to realise that you won't be right all the time, says Smith. 'But when you get it wrong, keep losses to a minimum.' </p> <p>Copeland admits to feeling sick when one of his shares is falling. However, he says that for him selling is no more difficult than buying. 'There is always a price, even though it is not always the one you want,' he says. He, too, warns against becoming emotionally attached: 'I bought a share at 34p, it went up to 86, and down to 4p. I am still holding it. Don't get too close to your shares, they are only numbers.' </p> <p>Brennan Hiorns, chief investment officer at Teather &amp; Greenwood private clients, has survived several bear markets, including 1975, which he says was the worst in stock market history since 1929. </p> <p>Despite his vast experience, he admits that plummeting stock prices still get to him. 'I feel a kind of sense of annoyance,' he says. </p> <p>But despite the occasional knock-back, Hiorns remains optimistic. 'I take an ultimately bullish position,' he says. 'I believe there are good reasons for taking a long-term view.' </p> <p>Warburton agrees. 'Don't go reacting because of bad news, because by the time you have, the market has already moved.' In other words, keep a stiff upper lip. I am sure Corporal Jones would have approved.</p>",

This simple - if hypothetical - calculation eloquently sums up the marvel of long-term capital appreciation. </p> <p>A century ago, Marx saw capital as the ownership of the factories and machines that enabled one class to exploit another; today, in that old clich\u00e9, we're all capitalists now, albeit on a lesser scale, whether through our savings, our investments, our homes or our pension funds. Capital growth - building up our assets for the future - is what nearly everybody aims for at various stages of their life. The morality of using money to make money is no longer an issue for most of us, and the question becomes how best to achieve growth with an acceptable level of risk. </p> <p>Some people are lucky enough to be born with, if not exactly a silver spoon in their mouths, then at least a pretty handsome sum tucked away by parents or grandparents in their name. It would be tempting to think that anyone in this position would need little education in the merits of capital growth, but money gained effortlessly is seldom appreciated in the same way as wealth that has been acquired as a result of hard work. </p> <p>For most of us, the first serious imperative to build up a sum of capital is often the desire to save for the deposit to buy our first home. After that, some people probably save and invest just for the sake of it, without knowing exactly what they will spend the money on, although for a minority school fees become an important objective. In time though, retirement becomes the overriding reason for building up capital, as the prospect of living without a salary beckons. </p> <p>Whereas people once tended to rely on their pension to fund their retirement, many are now looking at building up their capital in other ways to the same end, because of the inflexible nature of pensions themselves, and a perception that they can exert greater control over financial assets that are held in other forms. </p> <p>Lump sums, as well as building up capital from our earnings, are also becoming an increasingly important source of capital, as the soaring property market has boosted legacies. Many people can also expect to receive a redundancy cheque at least once during their working life. </p> <p>Anybody looking to grow their capital has a number of issues to consider: how soon will they want to use the money? To what extent are they prepared to put their capital at risk? How can they protect it from taxes? And can you just put it away and leave it there, or do you need to review constantly the progress your assets are making, and act accordingly? </p> <p>On the last point, Frank Cochrane of Wolverhampton-based independent financial adviser FSC Financial Services is a firm believer in actively managing your portfolio. Too many people are complacent about their investments, he believes: they make their initial decision and then leave the money where it is when they should be prepared to move it if it is not performing. </p> <p>He advises clients looking for capital growth to use a multi-fund Isa, so that they can switch money over time as circumstances change. 'At various points of the cycle, a particular type of fund can have high returns for a period, or go into decline. Within a multi-fund approach, we can switch your money to take advantage of that,' says Cochrane. </p> <p>Multi-fund Isas such as Skandia and Sterling have slightly higher initial charges, he concedes, but they offer 380 funds between them, and the cost of switching is low - just 0.25 per cent. </p> <p>The term of the investment is also an important factor. Most advisers recommend that you invest in equities only if you are prepared to leave your money in the market for at least five years, because of the short-term ups and downs. The longer the horizon, the greater the risk you should be prepared to consider. 'Over 30 years, there will be a smoothing effect,' says Cochrane. But everyone has to take a level of risk he or she feels happy with, he adds. </p> <p>Investors are often warned not to be governed by tax considerations in choosing their investments, but for the long-term capital growth seeker, tax is an issue that can't be ignored. One day you may need to realise your assets, and if they are not sheltered you will pay capital gains tax on the profit - in other words on the growth - at the same rate as you would pay income tax on interest. The annual CGT-exempt allowance of \u00a37,200 may seem quite a lot now, but in 20 years' time, your lump sum invested today could have grown by many times that amount. The message is clear: protect as much of your investment as you can by using Isas and other tax-free wrappers. </p> <p>That leaves the thorny question of choosing what to invest in, and a popular misconception that needs to be dispelled. Many financial products are described in terms of either income or growth. Funds are often described as 'fixed income', 'high income' or 'extra income', for example. But this refers to the objectives of the fund managers, and does not mean that the fund cannot be included in a portfolio designed to achieve capital growth for the investor. </p> <p>'The vast majority of unit trusts, Oeics and investment trusts are designed to give capital growth to some degree,' says Tim Cockerill of Bath-based IFA Chartwell Investment Management. 'The only ones that are specifically not oriented towards providing any capital growth tend to be corporate bonds, high-yield and gilts funds.' But as Cockerill readily concedes, for much of the past few decades you could have achieved better growth in your capital by investing in funds that were heavily oriented towards providing income, and reinvesting - or 'rolling up' - that income. Income fund managers have, he says, less freedom to operate, since the managers are often constrained to buy stocks with high yields. This discipline often proved to their advantage, since when their share price rose, the yield fell and the manager had to sell, delivering capital growth for the fund. </p> <p>Cockerill believes that there has been a cultural shift during the past few years in favour of growth-oriented funds as the UK's historic short-term dividend culture has waned, and the tax treatment of dividends has become less favourable. Nevertheless, he says that income funds can still play a part in a growth portfolio, especially for investors who are more risk-averse. </p> <p>The important thing, he says, is to have a reason for choosing your investments. Those looking for long-term capital growth cannot afford the luxury of leaving their money in one place and simply hoping it does well; you should review your investment on a regular basis, and then make changes if you think that the circumstances, and the opportunities, have changed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager who feels so passionately about the abolition of football's transfer system he has threatened to walk away from club football if the process collapses, has urged other managers to speak out about it before the spirit of the game is destroyed. </p> <p>On the day his team travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United, he has targeted Sir Alex Ferguson, one of most powerful managers in the world game, as a figure who must enter the debate for the good of football. </p> <p>'Alex Ferguson has a strong voice and he cares for the game. It would help if somebody like him came out to add his voice. Maybe he has a completely different opinion but that opinion would have weight. I had a chat with Lennart Johansson [the president of Uefa] about it and he said, \"You have to come out with what you think is right, everybody else is refusing to say.\" I am surprised I am the only voice to come out. It doesn't mean I am right, but I would like to know the opinion of other people. </p> <p>'I wanted to put some pressure for other people to speak out but it looks like nobody reacts. It seems managers, players and directors don't care about the rules we are working with. Nobody. In England, France, Spain, Italy... nobody.' </p> <p>With the European Union and football's governing bodies expected to bring the saga to a conclusion on Tuesday, Wenger is horrified that club football has shown such widespread apathy to such a vital decision. </p> <p>He believes the EU's attempt to bring footballers into line with ordinary workers by offering absolute freedom of movement will obliterate club loyalty and make it impossible to manage a team, with players free to come and go at will. </p> <p>So far, Wenger has been the only one to put his head above the parapet and campaign against the proposed changes. 'I have the feeling that inside football everybody speaks only of their own problems, just winning the next game. It's not only about that. We have a responsibility to defend football. I just think football needs support. </p> <p>'I don't want to say that I am right - but what is most surprising is we are speaking about the future of our sport, and it looks like this is going through without anybody expressing an opinion. That is difficult to understand.

      "bodyText": "Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager who feels so passionately about the abolition of football's transfer system he has threatened to walk away from club football if the process collapses, has urged other managers to speak out about it before the spirit of the game is destroyed. On the day his team travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United, he has targeted Sir Alex Ferguson, one of most powerful managers in the world game, as a figure who must enter the debate for the good of football. 'Alex Ferguson has a strong voice and he cares for the game. It would help if somebody like him came out to add his voice. Maybe he has a completely different opinion but that opinion would have weight. I had a chat with Lennart Johansson [the president of Uefa] about it and he said, \"You have to come out with what you think is right, everybody else is refusing to say.\" I am surprised I am the only voice to come out. It doesn't mean I am right, but I would like to know the opinion of other people. 'I wanted to put some pressure for other people to speak out but it looks like nobody reacts. It seems managers, players and directors don't care about the rules we are working with. Nobody. In England, France, Spain, Italy... nobody.' With the European Union and football's governing bodies expected to bring the saga to a conclusion on Tuesday, Wenger is horrified that club football has shown such widespread apathy to such a vital decision. He believes the EU's attempt to bring footballers into line with ordinary workers by offering absolute freedom of movement will obliterate club loyalty and make it impossible to manage a team, with players free to come and go at will. So far, Wenger has been the only one to put his head above the parapet and campaign against the proposed changes. 'I have the feeling that inside football everybody speaks only of their own problems, just winning the next game. It's not only about that. We have a responsibility to defend football. I just think football needs support. 'I don't want to say that I am right - but what is most surprising is we are speaking about the future of our sport, and it looks like this is going through without anybody expressing an opinion. That is difficult to understand. Just because you are under pressure for the next game it doesn't mean people who work in football can't express their opinion. 'The players have to defend their view as well but I don't feel players know what is really going on. It's a shame, because we are talking about the future of football. I am not speaking for me. It's the players who will be managers in 20 years' time. It is difficult to accept.' Even more galling to him is the notion that while the football profession turns a blind eye, the politicians responsible for overhauling the system, because they are not involved in the game, fail to see the ramifications. 'When I heard what they [the politicians] were saying at the start I thought they didn't know about football,' he said. 'It's impossible [for any one who knows about football] to say what they are saying. Can football survive by thinking the club is nothing any more except a railway station where players stay as long as they want and travel to somewhere else if they have to? 'Politicians?

      "bodyText": "Michael Portillo faced intense pressure last night to reveal the full scale of his business affairs after leaked documents showed he was given secret payments by an oil giant. As calls for an inquiry into Portillo's earnings mounted, it was revealed that the shadow chancellor had only disclosed earnings of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000 from the oil firm - and that this was 'only a small proportion of a wider agreement' between the two parties. A letter from oil exploration giant Kerr McGee - a copy of which has been obtained by The Observer - states that the cash Portillo is paid by the firm for 'parliamentary activities' is much smaller than his overall earnings for general advice. Portillo last night refused to disclose his overall income from the oil firm. The revelation will raise the question of cash for access, as Portillo, often regarded as the next leader of the Tory party, is the man responsible for setting Tory tax policy for oil companies. Last year the shadow chancellor was the driving force behind plans to offer oil firms a 3p a litre cut in duty as a way of seeing off the fuel protesters. 'I'll be writing to the authorities and demanding a full investigation,' said Fraser Kemp, a senior Labour backbencher and close ally of Tony Blair. 'Mr Portillo is the shadow chancellor and responsible for making opposition policy on fuel taxes at a time when the industry's and his company's profits have gone through the roof. He must declare every penny he receives from this firm and the precise nature of the work he does for them.' Kemp said that Portillo's payments fromKerr McGee, the world's third largest oil exploration company, made his position 'untenable'. 'His constituents have every right to ask who he's spending his time working for - the people who elected him or the oil industry.' The letter was placed by Portillo in the Register of Members' Interests in the House of Commons. Signed by Frank Sharratt, the chairman of Kerr McGee, it states: 'You have worked for Kerr McGee between 1981 and 1983 and between 1997 and the present.' Although the letter says that the company 'rarely' asks Portillo's advice on British political issues, it goes on to say that 'we would not wish to preclude ourselves from ever receiving your advice on UK matters'. The letter, dated 26 January, 2000, states: 'We understand that you wish to register your remuneration for parliamentary services to us, which form a small proportion of a much wider agreement, and the remuneration for that part of our agreement is between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000.' Kemp said that the clear implication from the letter was that Portillo was in fact paid much more for the advice he gave the company. The letter reignites the row over Portillo's business affairs. The shadow chancellor was forced to make an embarrassing apology to the House of Commons last April when he admitted that he had failed to raise his connections with the firm when discussing fuel duty during the debate on the budget.

He is involved in a court row over a meaty chunk of his Big Mac advertising pay-outs. </p> <p>Barthez has earned about \u00a3850,000 from advertising contracts he signed with McDonald's and sportswear giants Adidas.

It is good for his peace of mind to have his own place after six months in hotels.As for the rest, he likes to go out and has found the perfect guide in Dwight Yorke.' </p> <p>Ferguson says it took Schmeichel two years to reach the same stage of settling in that Barthez has achieved. </p> <p>'The more important the match is, the more people there are, the more Fabien is there for you,' he adds.

      "body": "<p>The only similarity in circumstances between what the two men were doing last Friday was the cold weather. Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, at Camp David, meeting the President of the United States. William Hague, Leader of the Opposition, in Worcester, West Midlands, meeting 250 hardy souls at a Save the Pound rally. The eyes of the world's media on one. The eyes of a local reporter on the other.</p> <p>Last week Blair enjoyed that rare occurrence in British political life: a slip-free week. Inflation at its lowest level for 30 years, a battle between the major banks and building societies that has seen half a percentage point come off many people's mortgages, unemployment threatening to fall below one million, Gordon Brown with a \u00a315 billion war chest which Treasury sources admit is so large government departments will have a problem spending it.</p> <p>At Labour's Millbank HQ, officials hardly dare believe it. Blair keeps banging on about not being complacent, saying the election could still be lost. 'Quite frankly, we don't believe that,' said one veteran Labour MP. 'There is more chance of an asteroid hitting the Earth than Hague walking into Number 10.'</p> <p>Last week Hague endured that regular occurrence in British political life: a week that didn't turn out quite as intended. Although his plans for a \u00a31,000 tax incentive for married couples with children was applauded by many, any advantage was soon swept off the front pages by the most dismal poll to afflict a Leader of the Opposition this close to an election since the advent of modern polling.</p> <p>The Tories are as far behind Labour now as they were in February 1997. More Labour voters say they are certain or likely to vote than do Tory voters. Hague's personal rating has 'gone negative' for the first time in 12 months, and on managing the economy twice as many people think the Government is better able to control public finances than the Opposition. In Conservative Central Office, they are already contemplating meltdown, with the most pessimistic saying that Blair will be returned to power with a majority still well over 100 seats.</p> <p>The supporters of Michael Portillo are gathering again, quietly whispering that their man, far from ruling himself out of the race while Hague is still in situ , might have to ride to the rescue of the party soon after the election. The storm clouds are gathering.</p> <p>As Hague stepped wearily onto his soap box in Worcester High Street, microphone in hand, his major problem was sitting 200 yards away sipping a cafe latte.</p> <p>The Leader of the Opposition was in the home of the fabled Worcester woman, the Middle England swing voter, resident of a seat that was once a Tory stronghold and is now Labour's with a majority of more than 7,000. It is one of Hague's target constituencies, now peppered with smart coffee shops and boutiques, the sheen of prosperity.</p> <p>Rob Price, of Oakland Estate Agents, admits business is better than ever before in his town centre office. 'There has definitely been an increase in business over the past year. I think it is because there is more money around.'</p> <p>This is Hague's problem, and Blair's bonus. People may not describe themselves as political, but they notice when there's a bit more money in the bank at the end of the month. Jeffrey Smith from Worcester happily voted Margaret Thatcher to power in 1979. But he would never contemplate voting for Hague.</p> <p>'I think Labour have kept their promises and they're going down the right track,' the former accountant said. Despite Labour strategists' fears, the Peter Mandelson crisis doesn't raise an eyebrow. Lord Irvine's fund-raising dinner hardly causes a ripple. 'Every party has its fair share of scandals.'</p> <p>Jill Hedges would be a godsend to a pollster, the archetypal Worcester resident, middle-aged and mother of two, who describes herself as a floating voter. Hedges has to vote for Hague if the Tories are to have any hope.</p> <p>'I'll be voting Labour again this time,' she said. As Hague spoke of the threat to British sovereignty, his words were lost among the bustle of the Friday afternoon shoppers, spending a little more money and feeling a little more contented. It's the economy, stupid.</p> <p>In Glasgow eight days ago - 48 hours before the arrival of Blair - Brown and his entourage swept into the Scottish Exhibition and Conference centre: Ed Balls, his chief economic adviser, Ed Miliband, Balls's deputy and brother to Downing Street's head of policy, David, and Danny Alexander, MP for Paisley and key election strategist.

      "bodyText": "The only similarity in circumstances between what the two men were doing last Friday was the cold weather. Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, at Camp David, meeting the President of the United States. William Hague, Leader of the Opposition, in Worcester, West Midlands, meeting 250 hardy souls at a Save the Pound rally. The eyes of the world's media on one. The eyes of a local reporter on the other. Last week Blair enjoyed that rare occurrence in British political life: a slip-free week. Inflation at its lowest level for 30 years, a battle between the major banks and building societies that has seen half a percentage point come off many people's mortgages, unemployment threatening to fall below one million, Gordon Brown with a \u00a315 billion war chest which Treasury sources admit is so large government departments will have a problem spending it. At Labour's Millbank HQ, officials hardly dare believe it. Blair keeps banging on about not being complacent, saying the election could still be lost. 'Quite frankly, we don't believe that,' said one veteran Labour MP. 'There is more chance of an asteroid hitting the Earth than Hague walking into Number 10.' Last week Hague endured that regular occurrence in British political life: a week that didn't turn out quite as intended. Although his plans for a \u00a31,000 tax incentive for married couples with children was applauded by many, any advantage was soon swept off the front pages by the most dismal poll to afflict a Leader of the Opposition this close to an election since the advent of modern polling. The Tories are as far behind Labour now as they were in February 1997. More Labour voters say they are certain or likely to vote than do Tory voters. Hague's personal rating has 'gone negative' for the first time in 12 months, and on managing the economy twice as many people think the Government is better able to control public finances than the Opposition. In Conservative Central Office, they are already contemplating meltdown, with the most pessimistic saying that Blair will be returned to power with a majority still well over 100 seats. The supporters of Michael Portillo are gathering again, quietly whispering that their man, far from ruling himself out of the race while Hague is still in situ , might have to ride to the rescue of the party soon after the election. The storm clouds are gathering. As Hague stepped wearily onto his soap box in Worcester High Street, microphone in hand, his major problem was sitting 200 yards away sipping a cafe latte. The Leader of the Opposition was in the home of the fabled Worcester woman, the Middle England swing voter, resident of a seat that was once a Tory stronghold and is now Labour's with a majority of more than 7,000. It is one of Hague's target constituencies, now peppered with smart coffee shops and boutiques, the sheen of prosperity. Rob Price, of Oakland Estate Agents, admits business is better than ever before in his town centre office. 'There has definitely been an increase in business over the past year. I think it is because there is more money around.' This is Hague's problem, and Blair's bonus. People may not describe themselves as political, but they notice when there's a bit more money in the bank at the end of the month. Jeffrey Smith from Worcester happily voted Margaret Thatcher to power in 1979. But he would never contemplate voting for Hague. 'I think Labour have kept their promises and they're going down the right track,' the former accountant said. Despite Labour strategists' fears, the Peter Mandelson crisis doesn't raise an eyebrow. Lord Irvine's fund-raising dinner hardly causes a ripple. 'Every party has its fair share of scandals.' Jill Hedges would be a godsend to a pollster, the archetypal Worcester resident, middle-aged and mother of two, who describes herself as a floating voter. Hedges has to vote for Hague if the Tories are to have any hope. 'I'll be voting Labour again this time,' she said. As Hague spoke of the threat to British sovereignty, his words were lost among the bustle of the Friday afternoon shoppers, spending a little more money and feeling a little more contented. It's the economy, stupid. In Glasgow eight days ago - 48 hours before the arrival of Blair - Brown and his entourage swept into the Scottish Exhibition and Conference centre: Ed Balls, his chief economic adviser, Ed Miliband, Balls's deputy and brother to Downing Street's head of policy, David, and Danny Alexander, MP for Paisley and key election strategist. When Balls gave the media briefing after Brown's speech on Friday, the scrum around him was 10 deep, leaving party officials to joke that the Prime Minister had organised the bombing of Baghdad just to keep the Chancellor off the front pages. Blair is in a position unheard of for a Prime Minister facing an election in a few weeks. But many Labour members see him as isolated, a man ill-at-ease with his own party. If it is the economy, which it is, then it is Brown who is receiving the plaudits. The Chancellor has sent an invitation to backbenchers asking them if they would like to arrange private, one-to-one audiences with him before the election to discuss any concerns. They will have at least 15 minutes each. It is classic Brown, tickling the tummy of the party in a way Blair finds almost impossible. Of course, Blair rides the wave of success and to the public is the pleasant face of New Labour. His popularity ratings are up. But for every quarter of a point off the interest rate, for every 100,000 fewer unemployed, for every extra child taken out of poverty, it is the Chancellor who is able to puff his chest up that little bit bigger.

      "body": "<p>She looked drained even before it began. Standing on the marble floor of a Senate corridor in Washington on Thursday, Hillary Clinton wore a hunted look. It was time to explain.</p> <p>The former First Lady had become embroiled in the presidential pardons controversy after it emerged that her brother Hugh Rodham had received thousands of dollars from two prominent beneficiaries of Bill Clinton's clemency orders. Squinting into the glare of the television lights, the junior New York senator composed herself before telling reporters she was 'saddened and disappointed' by the affair.</p> <p>It was a vintage performance. Red-eyed, she said her brother's 'terrible misjudgment' was 'a very sad matter' to her personally. 'I was heartbroken and shocked and insisted the money had to be returned.'</p> <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton must be rueing her misfortune with men. No sooner had she embarked on her own political career than the men in her life - husband, errant brothers and brother-in-law - let her down one by one. Or that at least is her version of her first calamitous weeks in public service.</p> <p>This was supposed to be her time of triumph: a first First Lady elected to office on a landslide victory, with a chance for the White House in four years time. The impeachment of her husband for lying about his betrayal of her was in the past, and her own political blunders largely forgotten. She had two new houses, a daughter about to turn 21, an $8 million book deal and a husband who would be out of harm's way, building his presidential library in Little Rock. Everything looked rosy.</p> <p>But that was before the events of the last five weeks that have left the Clintons adrift, disgraced and exposed without the defensive machinery of the highest office in the land. To even their most ardent supporters, the rashness of their behaviour as their White House years drew to a close has left the bitter taste of disappointment.</p> <p>The hoarding of gifts, flouting the spirit of Senate rules with the book deal, the furniture returned and the accusations of petty vandalism at the White House - and above all, the unmistakably self-interested use of the presidential pardon - have all conspired to make the Clintons unwelcome.</p> <p>And it's Hillary who must pay the political price. 'The Clintons are the Sopranos,' wrote Washington Post columnist Joel Achenbach in one of the kinder editorials.

Even Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic Party chairman, who calls the ex-President his best friend, says Bill Clinton should disappear for six months. And last week former President Jimmy Carter ended his reluctance to comment on the pardons. 'In my opinion, it was disgraceful,' he said.</p> <p>Hillary's most ardent supporters are having a hard time accepting her story that she knew nothing about the pardons. She is also now under the scrutiny of prosecutors in New York who are to widen their probe of the pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich and open an investigation into whether the sentences of four convicted swindlers were commuted in exchange for a block of Hasidic Jewish votes during her run for the Senate. Again there was a denial: 'I did not play any role whatsoever,' she said last month, despite acknowledging she sat in on a meeting in December with supporters of the clemency appeal. 'I had no opinion about it'.</p> <p>The clear subtext of Senator Clinton's denials has been to pass the buck to the men in her life, particularly her accident-prone husband. A friend of Hillary told US News &amp; World Report : 'I'm sure she's screaming at him. She gets mad at him for being so stupid.'</p> <p>When it was revealed that Hugh Rodham received $400,000 after successfully lobbying the White House on behalf of Glenn Braswell, a swindler in the anti-baldness business, and Carlos Vignali, a major cocaine dealer, Hillary said she knew nothing of the matter. She used the word 'disappointed' 20 times.</p> <p>Call it bad fortune or bad judgment, but Hillary's got man trouble. In fact, it's an affliction she's long suffered from. It's not just her husband, whose character fault-lines have been obvious to the world since Gennifer Flowers starred in the first bimbo eruption in 1992. Soon after he was elected there was the strange suicide of Hillary's friend and White House counsel Vince Foster. Then there was the Whitewater triumvirate of Jim McDougal, David Hale and Webster Hubble, and the death of Commerce Secretary and friend Ron Brown in an air crash in Bosnia.</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest man trouble Hillary now faces is with the men she had no choice in being connected to - her brothers and brother-in-law. For many Democrats the last straw has been the involvement of Hugh Rodham in the pardon controversy. To Hillary's White House staff her bearish brothers were known as 'the Brothers Rodham': Hughie and Tony, the President's occasional golfing partners, frequent visitors for family celebrations and holidays.</p> <p>They often brought bad news. 'You never wanted to hear their name come up in any context other than playing golf,' said a former senior aide. 'They're like mama's boys. They seem to feel, \"We've been out there, we've been in this fishbowl, and we're not getting anything\".'</p> <p>For Hugh and Tony Rodham, the impressive family connections have never quite clicked. A former public defender, Hugh Rodham joined high-stakes tobacco litigation in Florida but failed to collect on a $50 million fee he expected. He also joined a team of lawyers suing the firearms industry but that, too, has yet to pay off.</p> <p>In 1994 he made his first run for public office as a candidate for the Senate, enlisting his sister to campaign for him. That came to grief after he called his opponent an 'anti-semitic Jew'.</p> <p>The brothers got themselves into their biggest scrape when they were recruited into a business that grows and packages hazelnuts in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. They found themselves in the company of Aslan Abashidze, the political boss of the Adjari section of Georgia, an area full of drug dealers and organised crime bosses. Abashidze liked to have his picture taken with 'the boys' and used the hazelnut deal to suggest the US supported his political challenge to Georgia's president, Eduard Shevardnadze.</p> <p>The Rodham brothers were asked by Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, to abandon the deal in 1998, and they agreed. But soon they were back meeting with Abashidze, who is close to Russian intelligence officials, saying they intended only to distribute the nuts.</p> <p>While Hugh Rodham finally did abandon the project, Tony, who was married to the daughter of California senator Barbara Boxer and was the more belligerent brother, continued to pursue it. He accompanied Abashidze on a trip to Washington earlier this year. 'The Rodhams are way over their heads in not understanding the geopolitical consequences of their deal,' said a former US government official familiar with their work in Georgia. 'They're swimming in hostile waters.'</p> <p>The Clintons seem unable to cast them adrift - they even accompanied the couple on their 1975 honeymoon to Acapulco - and aides say Bill and Hillary are fiercely protective of them.</p> <p>But Hugh's big clemency pay-off did not materialise: he was holed up in his Florida flat for three days last week after he promised his sister to return his $400,000 clemency windfall. And he surprised his sister again yesterday when it was revealed that he had successfully repaid the full amount to Braswell but has managed to repay only part of the fees he collected from the family of Vignali.</p> <p>Despite predictions to the contrary, Bill Clinton's half-brother Roger has been less trouble than the Rodhams - but only marginally less embarrassing. He once toured North Korea with his rock band, and was quoted as saying he found the standard of the country's artists 'higher than that of any country in the world'.</p> <p>Last week he was reported to be disappointed that the pardons he promised half-a-dozen of his friends, including some he served time with in prison for cocaine trafficking, did no materialise.</p> <p>Though he denies taking money for making the recommendations, which he left on his brother's desk in the Oval Office, he is still dejected that big brother Bill passed over his friends. He did not talk to his brother for two weeks. 'It sort of caused a rift,' he said. 'My feelings were hurt. I was a disaster.'</p> <p>He hit the bottle, and barely three weeks after receiving his own pardon was arrested for drunk driving in California. Ominously, congressional investigators looking into the whole pardon fiasco asked whether he played any role in the successful pardons of four men, including Vignali and Braswell. They say they have information that he received $30,000 from Vignali and $15,000 from Philip Young, a Louisiana man convicted in 1992 of illegal transport of fish and wildlife.</p> <p>Whether Hillary has difficulties with the men in her life just because politics is dominated by men, because she has poor judgment, because they take advantage of her or because they are convenient creatures to blame, it was clear yesterday that her problems are still multiplying. And the biggest of them is stewing at home in Chappaqua, upstate New York. For now, any talk about her presidential prospects has been quashed. 'If this hurts anyone, it hurts Hillary much more,' said a party official.</p> <p>Ever since her swearing-in last month, Hillary has tried to play the dutiful student. She has plunged into the arcana of health care and taxes, tended to her New York constituents and done her best to hammer out a political identity separate from that of her husband.</p> <p>James Carville, Clinton's 1992 campaign strategist, told the New York Times of his sympathy at Hillary having to deal with the mess created by the two most important men in her life. 'It's a horrible personal thing,' he said. 'You can pick your friends. But you can't pick your relatives.'</p> <p><br><b>Boys will be boys</b></p> <p><br><b> HUSBAND</b><br> Bill Clinton: At 54, the youngest ever ex-US president.

It's not just her husband, whose character fault-lines have been obvious to the world since Gennifer Flowers starred in the first bimbo eruption in 1992. Soon after he was elected there was the strange suicide of Hillary's friend and White House counsel Vince Foster. Then there was the Whitewater triumvirate of Jim McDougal, David Hale and Webster Hubble, and the death of Commerce Secretary and friend Ron Brown in an air crash in Bosnia. But perhaps the biggest man trouble Hillary now faces is with the men she had no choice in being connected to - her brothers and brother-in-law. For many Democrats the last straw has been the involvement of Hugh Rodham in the pardon controversy. To Hillary's White House staff her bearish brothers were known as 'the Brothers Rodham': Hughie and Tony, the President's occasional golfing partners, frequent visitors for family celebrations and holidays. They often brought bad news. 'You never wanted to hear their name come up in any context other than playing golf,' said a former senior aide. 'They're like mama's boys. They seem to feel, \"We've been out there, we've been in this fishbowl, and we're not getting anything\".' For Hugh and Tony Rodham, the impressive family connections have never quite clicked. A former public defender, Hugh Rodham joined high-stakes tobacco litigation in Florida but failed to collect on a $50 million fee he expected. He also joined a team of lawyers suing the firearms industry but that, too, has yet to pay off. In 1994 he made his first run for public office as a candidate for the Senate, enlisting his sister to campaign for him. That came to grief after he called his opponent an 'anti-semitic Jew'. The brothers got themselves into their biggest scrape when they were recruited into a business that grows and packages hazelnuts in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. They found themselves in the company of Aslan Abashidze, the political boss of the Adjari section of Georgia, an area full of drug dealers and organised crime bosses. Abashidze liked to have his picture taken with 'the boys' and used the hazelnut deal to suggest the US supported his political challenge to Georgia's president, Eduard Shevardnadze. The Rodham brothers were asked by Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, to abandon the deal in 1998, and they agreed. But soon they were back meeting with Abashidze, who is close to Russian intelligence officials, saying they intended only to distribute the nuts. While Hugh Rodham finally did abandon the project, Tony, who was married to the daughter of California senator Barbara Boxer and was the more belligerent brother, continued to pursue it. He accompanied Abashidze on a trip to Washington earlier this year. 'The Rodhams are way over their heads in not understanding the geopolitical consequences of their deal,' said a former US government official familiar with their work in Georgia. 'They're swimming in hostile waters.' The Clintons seem unable to cast them adrift - they even accompanied the couple on their 1975 honeymoon to Acapulco - and aides say Bill and Hillary are fiercely protective of them. But Hugh's big clemency pay-off did not materialise: he was holed up in his Florida flat for three days last week after he promised his sister to return his $400,000 clemency windfall. And he surprised his sister again yesterday when it was revealed that he had successfully repaid the full amount to Braswell but has managed to repay only part of the fees he collected from the family of Vignali. Despite predictions to the contrary, Bill Clinton's half-brother Roger has been less trouble than the Rodhams - but only marginally less embarrassing. He once toured North Korea with his rock band, and was quoted as saying he found the standard of the country's artists 'higher than that of any country in the world'. Last week he was reported to be disappointed that the pardons he promised half-a-dozen of his friends, including some he served time with in prison for cocaine trafficking, did no materialise. Though he denies taking money for making the recommendations, which he left on his brother's desk in the Oval Office, he is still dejected that big brother Bill passed over his friends. He did not talk to his brother for two weeks. 'It sort of caused a rift,' he said. 'My feelings were hurt. I was a disaster.' He hit the bottle, and barely three weeks after receiving his own pardon was arrested for drunk driving in California. Ominously, congressional investigators looking into the whole pardon fiasco asked whether he played any role in the successful pardons of four men, including Vignali and Braswell. They say they have information that he received $30,000 from Vignali and $15,000 from Philip Young, a Louisiana man convicted in 1992 of illegal transport of fish and wildlife. Whether Hillary has difficulties with the men in her life just because politics is dominated by men, because she has poor judgment, because they take advantage of her or because they are convenient creatures to blame, it was clear yesterday that her problems are still multiplying. And the biggest of them is stewing at home in Chappaqua, upstate New York. For now, any talk about her presidential prospects has been quashed. 'If this hurts anyone, it hurts Hillary much more,' said a party official. Ever since her swearing-in last month, Hillary has tried to play the dutiful student. She has plunged into the arcana of health care and taxes, tended to her New York constituents and done her best to hammer out a political identity separate from that of her husband. James Carville, Clinton's 1992 campaign strategist, told the New York Times of his sympathy at Hillary having to deal with the mess created by the two most important men in her life. 'It's a horrible personal thing,' he said. 'You can pick your friends. But you can't pick your relatives.' Boys will be boys HUSBAND Bill Clinton: At 54, the youngest ever ex-US president. Ignited the entire controversy when he pardoned 140 people on his last day at the White House. Trying to raise funds to build a presidential library. BROTHER Hugh Rodham: Obese brother of Hillary. Pocketed $400,000 for successfully lobbying for the pardon of a convicted fraudster and a commutation for another criminal. Has since handed some of the cash back. BROTHER-IN-LAW Roger Clinton: Bill's 44-year-old half-brother. A former B-movie actor and singer, he was charged in California last week with drink-driving. Accused of trying to sell presidential pardons. BROTHER Tony Rodham: Embarked on a scheme with brother Hugh to sell hazelnuts in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Abandoned the scheme after pressure from Sandy Berger, former National Security Adviser to Bill Clinton.",

      "body": "<p>Flying a light aircraft will soon be as easy - and safer than - driving a car, according to aviation experts.</p> <p>A consortium of aircraft companies, university researchers, the US government and Nasa is developing a system which will allow the public to fly planes after a few minutes of rudimentary training. The group is combining advances in aircraft design with computer-assisted flight and tracking devices to develop a prototype of a system they have named the 'Highway in the Sky'.</p> <p>'These improvements will make flying so intuitive that any dummy will be able to do it,' said Keith McCrea, policy co-ordinator for the Virginia Department of Aviation. After a short briefing, a 12-year-old boy recently took off in and landed a light aircraft using the system.</p> <p>Even for today's private pilots, flying is becoming more and more like driving; the cabin of the SR20 four-seater made by Cirrus Design in Minnesota, for example, is similar to the inside of a family saloon.</p> <p>In place of the usual dizzying array of dials, the SR20 has a 26cm video display fed by global positioning system (GPS) data that provides a picture of the terrain beneath the aircraft, with airport, route and weather information superimposed on it. The number of controls has been pared down to a minimum. Another company, Moller International in California, is developing the Skycar, a vehicle capable of vertical take-off and landing. It will be able to fly as high as 30,000ft and carry four people at speeds of up to 400mph. Moller says that once it is in mass production the Skycar will cost the same as a mid-range BMW.</p> <p>The company's president, Paul Moller, said: 'It's our intention that it will eventually evolve into a completely automated form of transportation, making you a passenger, not a pilot.'</p> <p>A private pilot currently has to complete several hundred hours in the air to become fully trained for most conditions. Even preparing for a simple journey involves poring over maps, studying forecasts and calculating wind speeds and fuel consumption.</p> <p>Each stage of the flight requires the manipulation of several controls, monitoring dozens of gauges, liaising with air traffic control and compensating for weather conditions. 'This could change dramatically over the next decade,' said David Freedman, author of a study to be published next month by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p> <p>'The general goal of these programmes will be to make small aircraft as easy and safe to operate as cars - maybe even more so - and almost as inexpensive.'</p> <p>The Nasa-funded 'Highway in the Sky' uses satellite positioning, digital maps and constantly updated information about air traffic movements to guide a pilot through a series of hoops, or along a dotted line displayed in simulated 3-D on a screen. 'I could take someone with no train ing and in five minutes have him flying a plane all the way through a landing,' said John Hansman, an MIT aeronautics researcher. While researching his article for MIT's Technology Review magazine, Freedman challenged Hansman to do just that, with his 12-year-old son Alex. When Alex was shown the direction to fly on the type of GPS screen used by private pilots, he called it 'the most confusing thing' he had ever seen.</p> <p>Then Hansman switched on the 'Highway in the Sky'. Displayed in bright colours was an uncluttered image of the terrain with two parallel lines superimposed upon it, along with a blue cone off to the right. The lines defined the flight path and the cone was the destination airport.</p> <p>'OK,' said Alex, as he sat at the controls. 'So I just need to aim at the cone, right?'</p> <p>His father described the ease with which his son then put them on course: 'With the flair of a video game master homing his X-Wing fighter in on the Death Star's lone vulnerable hatch, Alex immediately banked the plane to bring the cone to the middle of the flight path.' On the final approach, Hansman needed only to issue a few verbal instructions for Alex to make a safe landing.</p> <p>Along with 'Highway in the Sky', a joint project is under way to develop 'smartports' by providing computerised air traffic control at hundreds of small, underused airfields, so that light aircraft could be automatically kept precise distances apart and guided during take-off and landing.</p> <p>The Skycar looks like a cross between a sports car and a tiny jet fighter. On take-off a blast of air from four large power pods, which contain counter-rotating engines attached to turbine blades, is directed downward by louvres, allowing the Skycar to lift straight up.</p> <p>It can be driven on the road at about 35mph and is compact enough to be parked in a garage. The cabin can be pressurised for high-level flight and in an emergency parachutes would lower the craft and its occupants to safety.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Flying a light aircraft will soon be as easy - and safer than - driving a car, according to aviation experts. A consortium of aircraft companies, university researchers, the US government and Nasa is developing a system which will allow the public to fly planes after a few minutes of rudimentary training. The group is combining advances in aircraft design with computer-assisted flight and tracking devices to develop a prototype of a system they have named the 'Highway in the Sky'. 'These improvements will make flying so intuitive that any dummy will be able to do it,' said Keith McCrea, policy co-ordinator for the Virginia Department of Aviation. After a short briefing, a 12-year-old boy recently took off in and landed a light aircraft using the system. Even for today's private pilots, flying is becoming more and more like driving; the cabin of the SR20 four-seater made by Cirrus Design in Minnesota, for example, is similar to the inside of a family saloon. In place of the usual dizzying array of dials, the SR20 has a 26cm video display fed by global positioning system (GPS) data that provides a picture of the terrain beneath the aircraft, with airport, route and weather information superimposed on it. The number of controls has been pared down to a minimum. Another company, Moller International in California, is developing the Skycar, a vehicle capable of vertical take-off and landing. It will be able to fly as high as 30,000ft and carry four people at speeds of up to 400mph. Moller says that once it is in mass production the Skycar will cost the same as a mid-range BMW. The company's president, Paul Moller, said: 'It's our intention that it will eventually evolve into a completely automated form of transportation, making you a passenger, not a pilot.' A private pilot currently has to complete several hundred hours in the air to become fully trained for most conditions. Even preparing for a simple journey involves poring over maps, studying forecasts and calculating wind speeds and fuel consumption. Each stage of the flight requires the manipulation of several controls, monitoring dozens of gauges, liaising with air traffic control and compensating for weather conditions. 'This could change dramatically over the next decade,' said David Freedman, author of a study to be published next month by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 'The general goal of these programmes will be to make small aircraft as easy and safe to operate as cars - maybe even more so - and almost as inexpensive.' The Nasa-funded 'Highway in the Sky' uses satellite positioning, digital maps and constantly updated information about air traffic movements to guide a pilot through a series of hoops, or along a dotted line displayed in simulated 3-D on a screen. 'I could take someone with no train ing and in five minutes have him flying a plane all the way through a landing,' said John Hansman, an MIT aeronautics researcher. While researching his article for MIT's Technology Review magazine, Freedman challenged Hansman to do just that, with his 12-year-old son Alex. When Alex was shown the direction to fly on the type of GPS screen used by private pilots, he called it 'the most confusing thing' he had ever seen. Then Hansman switched on the 'Highway in the Sky'. Displayed in bright colours was an uncluttered image of the terrain with two parallel lines superimposed upon it, along with a blue cone off to the right. The lines defined the flight path and the cone was the destination airport. 'OK,' said Alex, as he sat at the controls. 'So I just need to aim at the cone, right?' His father described the ease with which his son then put them on course: 'With the flair of a video game master homing his X-Wing fighter in on the Death Star's lone vulnerable hatch, Alex immediately banked the plane to bring the cone to the middle of the flight path.' On the final approach, Hansman needed only to issue a few verbal instructions for Alex to make a safe landing. Along with 'Highway in the Sky', a joint project is under way to develop 'smartports' by providing computerised air traffic control at hundreds of small, underused airfields, so that light aircraft could be automatically kept precise distances apart and guided during take-off and landing. The Skycar looks like a cross between a sports car and a tiny jet fighter. On take-off a blast of air from four large power pods, which contain counter-rotating engines attached to turbine blades, is directed downward by louvres, allowing the Skycar to lift straight up. It can be driven on the road at about 35mph and is compact enough to be parked in a garage. The cabin can be pressurised for high-level flight and in an emergency parachutes would lower the craft and its occupants to safety.",

And the young actor who plays the central victim must sit in his dressing room for scenes too graphic for him to see. Grace and Ecstasy, by James Martin Charlton, is the most explicit examination of paedophilia - which offenders call 'boy love' - ever staged and is likely to provoke strong criticism of both the director and the cast.

The funeral will take place near the family home in Sevenoaks, Kent.</p> <p>Jane Blackman, a reflexologist, has left the nationwide appeals and public appearances to other family members in the past eight months.</p> <p>But from the moment she received the phone call telling her that 22-year-old Lucie had disappeared in Japan and that a man had phoned to say that her daughter would never be seen again, Blackman has been a woman possessed.</p> <p>The call changed her life. She immediately gave up her job and began a ceaseless campaign to find her daughter, galvanising the initially recalcitrant Japanese police service into action.</p> <p>She deluged politicians, campaigners and policemen with phone calls, letters and emails, winning the support of Tony Blair and Robin Cook, who raised the matter with the Japanese government. Between them all, the family racked up more than \u00a365,000 in debts.</p> <p>Now that Lucie's remains, identifiable only by dental records, have been found on a Japanese beach, 30 miles south-west of Tokyo, Blackman is finding it hard to accept that her quest is over.</p> <p>'I wake in the night with this sick feeling that all this is true. I know time heals, but I feel I have had my heart removed. The realisation is gradually bearing down on me that I will never hear Lucie's laugh, see her smile, or hug her again,' she said.</p> <p>'What has upset me is the way some people still see Lucie as some kind of prostitute who had it coming to her,' said Blackman, struggling to maintain her composure.

      "bodyText": "It was the journey that Lucie's mother had dreaded, the one she had desperately prayed she would never have to make. But as she arrived in Tokyo yesterday for the fifth time since her daughter's disappearance last July, Jane Blackman could no longer cherish any illusions about the purpose of her visit. 'I have to sign documents to enable the body of my beloved daughter Lucie to be taken home and arrange for her funeral to be conducted with the dignity she deserves,' she said. 'There are no words to describe my grief. If you have a child, you will know exactly how I feel,' she added softly. Blackman and her former husband, Tim, who arrives in Japan tomorrow, hope to bring their daughter's remains home in the next 10 days. The funeral will take place near the family home in Sevenoaks, Kent. Jane Blackman, a reflexologist, has left the nationwide appeals and public appearances to other family members in the past eight months. But from the moment she received the phone call telling her that 22-year-old Lucie had disappeared in Japan and that a man had phoned to say that her daughter would never be seen again, Blackman has been a woman possessed. The call changed her life. She immediately gave up her job and began a ceaseless campaign to find her daughter, galvanising the initially recalcitrant Japanese police service into action. She deluged politicians, campaigners and policemen with phone calls, letters and emails, winning the support of Tony Blair and Robin Cook, who raised the matter with the Japanese government. Between them all, the family racked up more than \u00a365,000 in debts. Now that Lucie's remains, identifiable only by dental records, have been found on a Japanese beach, 30 miles south-west of Tokyo, Blackman is finding it hard to accept that her quest is over. 'I wake in the night with this sick feeling that all this is true. I know time heals, but I feel I have had my heart removed. The realisation is gradually bearing down on me that I will never hear Lucie's laugh, see her smile, or hug her again,' she said. 'What has upset me is the way some people still see Lucie as some kind of prostitute who had it coming to her,' said Blackman, struggling to maintain her composure. 'This is extremely hurtful. There was no sex involved with what Lucie was doing.' Lucie left her home last May with her friend, Louise Phillips, for the 'big adventure' she hoped would clear her mind and help her crys tallise her future plans. On the advice of Louise's sister, the girls decided to clear their debts by working as hostesses in the Casablanca bar, paid to flatter and entertain businessmen under the watchful eye of a mama-san, employed to ensure the flirtations were never misunderstood by the customers. 'I'm not some naive mother,' Blackman said. 'My daughter was simply doing what thousands of female travellers in need of cash do in Japan to make money: she was being paid for being charming and for flattering men over a few drinks. She could be anyone's daughter, sister or grandchild.' Blackman is determined not to let her life end with her daughter's. 'I don't want to become a person who is sitting there looking at photographs. Only once have I dreamt about Lucie, that she was alive and sitting on the hall stairs talking. Then I woke up and realised.' Businessman Joji Obara, whose luxury apartment lies just 200m from the cave where Lucie's remains were found, is the police's prime suspect, though charges have yet to be brought against him. amelia.hill@observer.co.uk",

They have offered him and Downing the opportunity to work as associate producers with a say over the casting.</p> <p>'The Americans have gone mad for this tale,' said Hale. 'I've had journalists from all parts of the States camped out here since the day Stephen was released.</p> <p>'This is a murder mystery of extreme proportions - Agatha Christie has nothing on it - and the Americans just love the Englishness of it all,' he said.</p> <p>The story will focus on Hale's attempts to get Downing freed after he was found guilty of the murder of Wendy Sewell, a local girl found dead in the cemetery in Bakewell, a small town in the Peak district. Hale received death threats and his car was almost run off the road when he took up Downing's case. Locals are said to know the names of the killers of Wendy, who was dubbed the Bakewell Tart on account of her fondness for open-air sex.</p> <p>'Bakewell is the quintessential chocolate-box village; the prim and proper place where lace curtains twitch but nothing ever happens because everything is swept under the carpet,' said Hale.</p> <p>'Americans are fascinated by the fact that we've taken on the British justice system and won,' he added. 'I think that's what particularly touched a nerve in America because in many states, Stephen would have been killed before he got to prove his innocence.'</p> <p>Neeson contacted Warner Brothers last month to express his interest in playing the part of Hale, who will make around \u00a350,000 from the film, while Hoskins looks set to play 44-year-old Downing, who walked free from prison earlier this month to worldwide acclaim.</p> <p>Hale, who was voted The Observer 's Man of the Year last December for championing Downing's case, has confirmed that Downing is expected to get around \u00a310,000 from the film.</p> <p>'It's difficult to comprehend all this,' he said. 'I've spent six years desperate for this kind of support and attention but have had to fight all the battles on my own. I've been fighting against the police, the Government, the CPS and even against my own newspaper, which was being leant on heavily to drop it all.</p> <p>'Then suddenly, from fighting against the current, I'm suddenly borne along on the crest of this enormous wave. It's the most extraordinary feeling.'</p> <p>Hale, who was subjected to three attempts on his life during his investigations and had to move home and have an ex-directory telephone number, believes that the role of the police could also play a major part in the film.</p> <p>'There's talk of Masonic links, family ties and love triangles between the police, the villains and the victim,' he said. 'One of the potential murderers was even engaged to Downing's sister for 18 months after the murder.'</p> <p>The film's producer, American-based Dave Hunt of FourBoys Films, heard about the case when he lived in Cambridge, four miles from Littlehey Prison where Downing spent most of his sentence. Hunt has been in contact with Hale ever since, flying to England at the time of Downing's bail hearing.</p> <p>But the film, whose working title is In Denial of Murder, is only one of three media projects based on what is being condemned as Britain's worst miscarriage of justice and which, as revealed last week, could win Downing more than \u00a38 million in compensation. Hale's own book, The Scapegoat, will be published in July and a British film based on the book, also called In Denial of Murder, has been commissioned by the BBC for screening in the autumn.</p> <p>The British film, to be screened in two two-hour programmes or three one-and-a-half-hour sections, looks set to star Christopher Eccleston as Hale, Julie Walters as Downing's mother, Pete Postlethwaite as Downing's father and Jane Horrocks as a reporter on the Matlock Mercury who played a major part in the investigation.</p> <p>'I don't know who will play the young Stephen,' said Hale. 'We need a great, lumbering character. The character of Wendy Sewell will be a sad one to cast but an important one to get right.'</p> <p>The BBC have committed around \u00a36m to the film and have bought in Hat Trick Productions to set up a film crew working under Mark Redhead, the Bafta-winning producer of the Murder of Stephen Lawrence, Sunday Bloody Sunday and This is Personal .</p> <p>'This will be a real tear-jerker,' said Hale. 'It'll play all the emotions: the romance, the sex and the intrigue.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Liam Neeson and Bob Hoskins are to star in a multi-million pound Hollywood film about the ordeal of Stephen Downing, who was imprisoned for 27 years for a murder he says he did not commit, and the attempts by newspaper editor Don Hale to have him freed. Three major Hollywood studios, including Warner Brothers and Columbia, have approached Hale. They have offered him and Downing the opportunity to work as associate producers with a say over the casting. 'The Americans have gone mad for this tale,' said Hale. 'I've had journalists from all parts of the States camped out here since the day Stephen was released. 'This is a murder mystery of extreme proportions - Agatha Christie has nothing on it - and the Americans just love the Englishness of it all,' he said. The story will focus on Hale's attempts to get Downing freed after he was found guilty of the murder of Wendy Sewell, a local girl found dead in the cemetery in Bakewell, a small town in the Peak district. Hale received death threats and his car was almost run off the road when he took up Downing's case. Locals are said to know the names of the killers of Wendy, who was dubbed the Bakewell Tart on account of her fondness for open-air sex. 'Bakewell is the quintessential chocolate-box village; the prim and proper place where lace curtains twitch but nothing ever happens because everything is swept under the carpet,' said Hale. 'Americans are fascinated by the fact that we've taken on the British justice system and won,' he added. 'I think that's what particularly touched a nerve in America because in many states, Stephen would have been killed before he got to prove his innocence.' Neeson contacted Warner Brothers last month to express his interest in playing the part of Hale, who will make around \u00a350,000 from the film, while Hoskins looks set to play 44-year-old Downing, who walked free from prison earlier this month to worldwide acclaim. Hale, who was voted The Observer 's Man of the Year last December for championing Downing's case, has confirmed that Downing is expected to get around \u00a310,000 from the film. 'It's difficult to comprehend all this,' he said. 'I've spent six years desperate for this kind of support and attention but have had to fight all the battles on my own. I've been fighting against the police, the Government, the CPS and even against my own newspaper, which was being leant on heavily to drop it all. 'Then suddenly, from fighting against the current, I'm suddenly borne along on the crest of this enormous wave. It's the most extraordinary feeling.' Hale, who was subjected to three attempts on his life during his investigations and had to move home and have an ex-directory telephone number, believes that the role of the police could also play a major part in the film. 'There's talk of Masonic links, family ties and love triangles between the police, the villains and the victim,' he said. 'One of the potential murderers was even engaged to Downing's sister for 18 months after the murder.' The film's producer, American-based Dave Hunt of FourBoys Films, heard about the case when he lived in Cambridge, four miles from Littlehey Prison where Downing spent most of his sentence. Hunt has been in contact with Hale ever since, flying to England at the time of Downing's bail hearing. But the film, whose working title is In Denial of Murder, is only one of three media projects based on what is being condemned as Britain's worst miscarriage of justice and which, as revealed last week, could win Downing more than \u00a38 million in compensation. Hale's own book, The Scapegoat, will be published in July and a British film based on the book, also called In Denial of Murder, has been commissioned by the BBC for screening in the autumn. The British film, to be screened in two two-hour programmes or three one-and-a-half-hour sections, looks set to star Christopher Eccleston as Hale, Julie Walters as Downing's mother, Pete Postlethwaite as Downing's father and Jane Horrocks as a reporter on the Matlock Mercury who played a major part in the investigation. 'I don't know who will play the young Stephen,' said Hale. 'We need a great, lumbering character. The character of Wendy Sewell will be a sad one to cast but an important one to get right.' The BBC have committed around \u00a36m to the film and have bought in Hat Trick Productions to set up a film crew working under Mark Redhead, the Bafta-winning producer of the Murder of Stephen Lawrence, Sunday Bloody Sunday and This is Personal . 'This will be a real tear-jerker,' said Hale. 'It'll play all the emotions: the romance, the sex and the intrigue.'",

      "body": "<p>It was just after 11am yesterday when the heavy oak door of a grey central London building swung open to let three grim-faced figures scuttle inside. The men from the ministry had arrived, bringing news from the frontline of the battle against foot and mouth disease.</p> <p>In a sparsely furnished room on the eighth floor of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food headquarters, they offered their prognosis.</p> <p>It was bad. Hundreds of farms remained sealed off to the outside world; livestock markets would stay shut for at least a week and the slaughter of animals had begun on eight farms. But Jim Scudamore, the chief veterinary surgeon, Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown and Baroness Hayman, a junior Minister, had one snippet of good news: no fresh outbreaks of the disease had been reported.</p> <p>They spoke as the grim preparations continued at Ronald and Bobby Waugh's Burnside Farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland to slaughter their pigs. It was here the disease is thought to have first emerged. In silence, locals watched as lorries carrying kindling and coal trundled through the rusty gates. In a nearby field, JCB diggers gouged huge holes in the earth.</p> <p>They were digging graves. In the farm's holding sheds vets had used specially-adapted guns to shoot the animals in the head before their bodies were taken to the pits for burning. The fires will be lit today.</p> <p>The pigs' deaths are no more horrific that their lives, according to reports of conditions at Burnside Farm. Vets declared it was the perfect breeding ground for the disease. Rotting pig carcasses had been left with live pigs. Pieces of raw meat were left lying about the farm. The sows gave birth among other pigs, and grown pigs were eating piglets.</p> <p>It took only days for the microscopic virus to bring the countryside to a halt. The transport of all livestock and meat have been banned and a dozen farms put in quarantine. Hunting has been stopped, horse racing banned, cattle markets closed.</p> <p>The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has shut all its reserves, and zoos including Whipsnade have closed their gates. Even the Army has been brought to a halt, suspending military exercises on rural land. Supermarkets now fear that with food supplies disrupted, panic buying will set in.</p> <p>The scale of the clampdown has nothing to do with the severity of the disease - it is almost entirely harmless to humans, and although it can be fatal to cloven-hooved animals, including pigs, goats and cattle, it usually causes blistering around the foot and mouth before the animal recovers. The reason for the alarm is the devastation the disease can cause to the farming industry and the economy. Animals suffering from foot and mouth lose their appetite, and meat production falls sharply. It is so infectious the entire national herd could succumb within days.</p> <p>The government believes the measures taken have contained the disease, but the long-term impact is already becoming clear. The crisis has yet again exposed the appalling conditions of animals on some farms, and brought to public attention the modern farming practices that have brought us cheap food... and an endless round of health scares from BSE to swine fever to E coli and salmonella.</p> <p>The outbreak has already exposed the frighteningly lax inspections of farms and the meat trade, and the consequences of long distance transport of food. Even though foot and mouth presents no threat to human health, it will add further momentum to demands for more naturally produced foods.</p> <p>That squalid conditions existed at Heddon-on-the-Wall was widely known. Locals often complained about it. Last year Hillside Animal Sanctuary in Norwich sent a team to inspect it. Prevented from getting in, they saw enough from the gate to call in the RSPCA.</p> <p>Acting on their advice, trading standards inspectors who visited the farm with MAFF officials on 22 December are thought to have wanted to prosecute. But MAFF officials simply told the Waughs to pull their socks up. A month later a further inspection also failed to spark action. The inspection last week by a vet revealed that the pigs were clearly suffering from foot and mouth, and had been for some time.</p> <p>The farmers said they had not noticed: 'I honestly hadn't seen anything wrong with any of my pigs in the last few weeks,' said Robert Waugh.</p> <p>But while it was incubating on his farm, the disease spread to Cheal Meats Abattoir in Essex, where the Northumberland pigs had been sent for slaughter. It has now spread to at least one other farm in Northumberland, and three sites near the abattoir. Dozens of farms are being investigated and hundreds of animals slaughtered and burned.</p> <p>Animals are routinely sent from one end of the country to the other for slaughter, the result of a decline in the number of abattoirs.

      "bodyText": "It was just after 11am yesterday when the heavy oak door of a grey central London building swung open to let three grim-faced figures scuttle inside. The men from the ministry had arrived, bringing news from the frontline of the battle against foot and mouth disease. In a sparsely furnished room on the eighth floor of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food headquarters, they offered their prognosis. It was bad. Hundreds of farms remained sealed off to the outside world; livestock markets would stay shut for at least a week and the slaughter of animals had begun on eight farms. But Jim Scudamore, the chief veterinary surgeon, Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown and Baroness Hayman, a junior Minister, had one snippet of good news: no fresh outbreaks of the disease had been reported. They spoke as the grim preparations continued at Ronald and Bobby Waugh's Burnside Farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland to slaughter their pigs. It was here the disease is thought to have first emerged. In silence, locals watched as lorries carrying kindling and coal trundled through the rusty gates. In a nearby field, JCB diggers gouged huge holes in the earth. They were digging graves. In the farm's holding sheds vets had used specially-adapted guns to shoot the animals in the head before their bodies were taken to the pits for burning. The fires will be lit today. The pigs' deaths are no more horrific that their lives, according to reports of conditions at Burnside Farm. Vets declared it was the perfect breeding ground for the disease. Rotting pig carcasses had been left with live pigs. Pieces of raw meat were left lying about the farm. The sows gave birth among other pigs, and grown pigs were eating piglets. It took only days for the microscopic virus to bring the countryside to a halt. The transport of all livestock and meat have been banned and a dozen farms put in quarantine. Hunting has been stopped, horse racing banned, cattle markets closed. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has shut all its reserves, and zoos including Whipsnade have closed their gates. Even the Army has been brought to a halt, suspending military exercises on rural land. Supermarkets now fear that with food supplies disrupted, panic buying will set in. The scale of the clampdown has nothing to do with the severity of the disease - it is almost entirely harmless to humans, and although it can be fatal to cloven-hooved animals, including pigs, goats and cattle, it usually causes blistering around the foot and mouth before the animal recovers. The reason for the alarm is the devastation the disease can cause to the farming industry and the economy. Animals suffering from foot and mouth lose their appetite, and meat production falls sharply. It is so infectious the entire national herd could succumb within days. The government believes the measures taken have contained the disease, but the long-term impact is already becoming clear. The crisis has yet again exposed the appalling conditions of animals on some farms, and brought to public attention the modern farming practices that have brought us cheap food... and an endless round of health scares from BSE to swine fever to E coli and salmonella. The outbreak has already exposed the frighteningly lax inspections of farms and the meat trade, and the consequences of long distance transport of food. Even though foot and mouth presents no threat to human health, it will add further momentum to demands for more naturally produced foods. That squalid conditions existed at Heddon-on-the-Wall was widely known. Locals often complained about it. Last year Hillside Animal Sanctuary in Norwich sent a team to inspect it. Prevented from getting in, they saw enough from the gate to call in the RSPCA. Acting on their advice, trading standards inspectors who visited the farm with MAFF officials on 22 December are thought to have wanted to prosecute. But MAFF officials simply told the Waughs to pull their socks up. A month later a further inspection also failed to spark action. The inspection last week by a vet revealed that the pigs were clearly suffering from foot and mouth, and had been for some time. The farmers said they had not noticed: 'I honestly hadn't seen anything wrong with any of my pigs in the last few weeks,' said Robert Waugh. But while it was incubating on his farm, the disease spread to Cheal Meats Abattoir in Essex, where the Northumberland pigs had been sent for slaughter. It has now spread to at least one other farm in Northumberland, and three sites near the abattoir. Dozens of farms are being investigated and hundreds of animals slaughtered and burned. Animals are routinely sent from one end of the country to the other for slaughter, the result of a decline in the number of abattoirs. Almost two-thirds of abattoirs have closed in the last 10 years - down from 1000 t0 340 - because of increased costs of inspection after the BSE crisis. Ewan Cameron, chairman of the Countryside Agency, said every market town should have an abattoir, a call taken up by Tories and Liberal Democrats.

At the precise moment I tuned in, the popular TV chef, Gary Rhodes, was asking Peter Capaldi, as the hotel manager, 'Is today's menu to your taste?' There was a pause, then Capaldi licked - yes, actually licked - Rhodes's proffered menu. Miraculously, I was soon revived (whisky, smelling salts), and the following day I eagerly requested a tape to ascertain whether the madly literal visual 'jokes' had carried on arriving quite as thick and fast, fast and thick. Perhaps a character would ask, 'Is that a Naked Gun in your pocket or are you just pleased to see me?', and someone might reply, 'No, it's not a gun, it's actually an erect penis!' </p> <p>But it was even worse-better, better-worse than that: 'Just the two knights is it?' said the girl on reception to ... two men in armour! 'Can I have my bill?' requested the owner of... a strap-on beak! 'Are those bags checked yet?' Capaldi wondered as the bellboy... painted a set of luggage in black and white checks! A joke all the more side-splitting because since when does luggage get checked into an hotel?! </p> <p>All right, I know actors have to work (and TV chefs are easily flattered) but it wasn't just Capaldi who had got himself messed up with Hotel ; there were lots of other people who might have known better: Paul McGann, Art Malik, Lysette Anthony, Keeley Hawes, Brian Conley, Lee Majors (though, on second thoughts, perhaps Majors might not know any better). </p> <p>Nonetheless, despite the sheer wanton pointlessness of it all, there was a peculiarly masochistic, jaw-dropping sort of pleasure to be had from surrendering oneself to Hotel 's awesomely grisly predictability. For example, when a character glanced out of a window and observed that 'it's getting to be a circus out there', one could not but giggle with anticipatory glee! Would the budget run to a big top... or just a selection of free-range performers? A clown, say, and a stilts-walker and a juggler? And would they be accompanied by that circus music - de-de-diddle-diddle-de-de-der-der!? Oh, ask a stupid question! </p> <p>A weirdorama week for drama, as it turned out. I was also quite baffled by Paul Abbott's <strong>Best of Both Worlds</strong>, a sexless, emotionless, loveless sort of a love triangle with Alice Evans playing Diane, an air stewardess-turned-opportunistic-bigamist with two different husbands waiting in two different airports. Abbott (Cracker, Clocking Off ) is normally a fine writer but things have gone very awry here: plot-plausibility and an attempt at convincing characterisation, for example. Not to mention the fact that Evans's airline uses those special TV planes with the implausibly wide aisles. </p> <p>Evans is blankly beautiful but utterly unconvincing, though perhaps she is just meant to be stupid. As a mother, she seemed to have a disturbing aversion to her son (who, after all, habitually air-kisses their child?). She also came out with some peculiarly meaningless observations: of her job she mused that 'you don't see the world, you see the same things in different shapes', which, when you think about it, doesn't mean anything... doesn't, in fact, mean anything even if you don't think about it. Her first husband and the father of her son was a restaurateur (confusingly, it seemed to be a happy marriage, so why the bigamy?), while her new husband was an Italian-Scots architect, based in Bologna and big in marble. 'I didn't know marble came from mountains...', said Alice, wistfully, when confronted with a marble mountain, 'I thought it came from the sea ... it's wavy and watery.' </p> <p>I really didn't think that, dramatically or comedically, things could get much more desperate than Hotel (which was at least meant to be ironically duff, I think) or Best of Both Worlds (which unfortunately may have had pretensions to Say Something), but then I hadn't yet seen <strong> Metrosexuality</strong>, a slice of over-styled, under-written yoof-orientated polymorphous perversity set in Notting Hill. Actually, I got quite angry about Metrosexuality . And here are my unedited notes to prove it: 'Whassup? Is there some sort of new minority crapness quota that has to be filled at Channel 4? Why is it that nobody can act? This is like something made for a far-flung cable outpost as a local community project. Why is everybody dressed like members of Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Babylon Zoo?' </p> <p>Unfathomably plotless and vapid, the best thing that can be said about the show is that the title at least hinted at a degree of urban grooviness, even if the result is, without any doubt, easily one of the very worst pieces of drama ever to be commissioned by a terrestrial channel. There are five more episodes you will wish to avoid. </p> <p>There was an enormous amount of pre-publicity for <strong> When Louis Met Paul and Debbie</strong> but it really didn't come close to Theroux's absorbingly skewed portrait of Jimmy Savile last year, even though the premise was the same. Theroux was up to all his old tricks - employing his disarmingly disingenuous interview technique and pseudo-gauche mateyness while angling for insights into the lives and lifestyle of Paul Daniels and Debbie McGee, but the difference was that while Savile appeared to have a dark side worth exploring, with Mr and Mrs Daniels what you see is what you get. They seem to be a touchingly devoted couple and though it may be easy enough to sneer or giggle at, say, Debbie's lilac basque and trousers ensemble (worn at breakfast!), or her belief that her touring ballet company, Ballet Imaginaire (a repertoire including excerpts from Swan Lake and Coppelia, plus a specially-written - by Paul! - magic-orientated second-half extravaganza) might take the provinces by storm, this didn't really provide Theroux with what he needed. </p> <p>The couple put up with Theroux rather stoically, I thought. Debbie seemed a sweet woman, even troubling to respond politely when Theroux cheekily suggested that her excellent figure may be the result of never having had children ('look at Jane Seymour, she's got a lovely figure...'), and even Daniels came out of it pretty well. Less stroppy and humourless than one would expect, he seemed only to lose his cool when he had to make an appearance on Celebrity Ready Steady Cook (who wouldn't?), a show he'd never seen, featuring another guest (Anna Ryder Richardson) he'd clearly never heard of. </p> <p>The most potentially intriguing bit of the programme, however, was Daniels's relationship with his brother, who appears to build his magic props and Debbie's ballet sets and live modestly (and perhaps slightly resentfully), on the proceeds, but this was skipped over. Theroux is always good value but he is better (and I suspect happier) exploring the dark side of those whose business is show, and unfortunately, there was no dark side to Paul and Debbie. No side at all, really. </p> <p>I can't think of anybody who could have provided a better voiceover for BBC2's new social history, <strong> Middle Classes</strong> , than Geoffrey Palmer. And, like the middle classes, there was a lot of Palmer to enjoy. A century ago, only a trifling 20 per cent of the population would have described themselves as middle class, topped off by the thin creamy layer of aristocracy and resting on a deeply stratified spongy base of the then working classes. </p> <p>Now, of course, everybody is middle class, more or less. Take, for example, Lady Victoria Hervey, the titled 'It' girl du nos jours, who, as the owner of a fashionable boutique, is clearly happy working in trade. The rise and sprawl of the middles came about mostly as a result of the manufacturing boom and concurrent 'democratisation of luxury', not to mention the vulcanisation of rubber (birth control of a sort ... latex didn't come on to the scene until the Twenties) and the opening of William Whiteley's fine department store in London's Queensway. </p> <p>Whiteley himself was a suitably self-made sort who came to a very Daily Mail -ish sticky end - murdered in his shop (now a glorified mall) by a man called Horace Rayner, who may have been his bastard son and was tired of struggling to remain respectable on a less-than-Herveyesque income. Rayner's death sentence was subsequently commuted to hard labour as a result of an intervention by the home secretary after a vast petition signed by, presumably, the burgeoning middle classes. Perhaps Whiteley's gripping true-life tale of retro-metrosexuality could be adapted as a drama by Channel 4.</p>",

Unfathomably plotless and vapid, the best thing that can be said about the show is that the title at least hinted at a degree of urban grooviness, even if the result is, without any doubt, easily one of the very worst pieces of drama ever to be commissioned by a terrestrial channel. There are five more episodes you will wish to avoid. There was an enormous amount of pre-publicity for When Louis Met Paul and Debbie but it really didn't come close to Theroux's absorbingly skewed portrait of Jimmy Savile last year, even though the premise was the same. Theroux was up to all his old tricks - employing his disarmingly disingenuous interview technique and pseudo-gauche mateyness while angling for insights into the lives and lifestyle of Paul Daniels and Debbie McGee, but the difference was that while Savile appeared to have a dark side worth exploring, with Mr and Mrs Daniels what you see is what you get. They seem to be a touchingly devoted couple and though it may be easy enough to sneer or giggle at, say, Debbie's lilac basque and trousers ensemble (worn at breakfast!), or her belief that her touring ballet company, Ballet Imaginaire (a repertoire including excerpts from Swan Lake and Coppelia, plus a specially-written - by Paul! - magic-orientated second-half extravaganza) might take the provinces by storm, this didn't really provide Theroux with what he needed. The couple put up with Theroux rather stoically, I thought. Debbie seemed a sweet woman, even troubling to respond politely when Theroux cheekily suggested that her excellent figure may be the result of never having had children ('look at Jane Seymour, she's got a lovely figure...'), and even Daniels came out of it pretty well. Less stroppy and humourless than one would expect, he seemed only to lose his cool when he had to make an appearance on Celebrity Ready Steady Cook (who wouldn't?), a show he'd never seen, featuring another guest (Anna Ryder Richardson) he'd clearly never heard of. The most potentially intriguing bit of the programme, however, was Daniels's relationship with his brother, who appears to build his magic props and Debbie's ballet sets and live modestly (and perhaps slightly resentfully), on the proceeds, but this was skipped over. Theroux is always good value but he is better (and I suspect happier) exploring the dark side of those whose business is show, and unfortunately, there was no dark side to Paul and Debbie. No side at all, really. I can't think of anybody who could have provided a better voiceover for BBC2's new social history, Middle Classes , than Geoffrey Palmer. And, like the middle classes, there was a lot of Palmer to enjoy. A century ago, only a trifling 20 per cent of the population would have described themselves as middle class, topped off by the thin creamy layer of aristocracy and resting on a deeply stratified spongy base of the then working classes. Now, of course, everybody is middle class, more or less. Take, for example, Lady Victoria Hervey, the titled 'It' girl du nos jours, who, as the owner of a fashionable boutique, is clearly happy working in trade. The rise and sprawl of the middles came about mostly as a result of the manufacturing boom and concurrent 'democratisation of luxury', not to mention the vulcanisation of rubber (birth control of a sort ... latex didn't come on to the scene until the Twenties) and the opening of William Whiteley's fine department store in London's Queensway. Whiteley himself was a suitably self-made sort who came to a very Daily Mail -ish sticky end - murdered in his shop (now a glorified mall) by a man called Horace Rayner, who may have been his bastard son and was tired of struggling to remain respectable on a less-than-Herveyesque income. Rayner's death sentence was subsequently commuted to hard labour as a result of an intervention by the home secretary after a vast petition signed by, presumably, the burgeoning middle classes. Perhaps Whiteley's gripping true-life tale of retro-metrosexuality could be adapted as a drama by Channel 4.",

Instead of a man divided between his higher and lower selves, a role that might have been played by one dancer, Moricone presents a mad scientist and a monster who cannot be contained. The setting is transposed from Victorian London to Fritz Lang's Metropolis. </p> <p>The result disconcerted NBT's opening-night audience, who were expecting something closer to the company's faithful adaptation of Dracula. (Both ballets will be presented at Sadler's Wells from 13 to 24 March as a dual 'Horror Dance' season.) Rather than chilling the blood, this <strong>Jekyll and Hyde</strong> leaves you cold. It is an exercise in style that would work better at half the length, on video rather than in the theatre. Most of the insight into the characters' actions is conveyed on film projections that cover clunky scene changes; Jekyll's splitting soul is never seen on stage. </p> <p>Hyde, the monster in the art-deco laboratory, dominates the ballet. Jonathan Ollivier, costumed in a mutant insect's carapace, is far bigger than Daniel de Andrade's dry twig of a doctor. In Stevenson's story, the balance is the other way round, with small, ape-like Hyde indulging in upright Jekyll's 'undignified pleasures'. In Moricone's ballet, these forbidden delights involve S&amp;M whips, masks, bare bottoms and latex gloves. The orgy kit and cast are hidden behind a revolving door, a red-plush entry to hell. </p> <p>Alessandro Ciammarughi's cinematic designs are more sophisticated than the would-be decadent choreography. Moricone makes little distinction between his low- and high-life worlds: indeed, the guests at Jekyll's engagement party are so louche that his alter ego 's intrusion comes as little surprise. The fianc\u00e9e, (Charlotte Talbot), has urges of her own, expressed in a languorous pre-party solo. </p> <p>At a key point in the ball, when her satin glove encounters Hyde's red rubber one, Moricone promises yet another psychosexual twist to the tale. But he lets the moment pass unexplored, as he does so much. We never find out why Hyde lets a prostitute go, but kills a capitalist, or whether Jekyll dies by his own will or Hyde's horrid hand. </p> <p>Narrative ballets, for some reason, are still handicapped by the need to spell out their stories from beginning to end. Contemporary dance is largely free from these constraints. In Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui's <strong> Rien de Rien</strong>, events happen simul taneously; spoken narratives are interrupted, never to be concluded. The anarchic show lasts 75 minutes without an interval (Jekyll and Hyde has two) and we leave refreshed. </p> <p>Cherkaoui is a Belgian-Moroccan member of Alain Platel's Ghent-based company, Les Ballets C de la B. Like Platel, he presents urban life as a soap opera in which cultures don't so much clash as overlap. It is a world in which polished floorboards are placed on top of oriental carpets and Arabic calligraphy looks like graffiti. Everybody is expected to dance, speak and sing in a multiplicity of languages. The last word, however, is given to the cello, played by Roel Dieltiens as a running commentary on the action. </p> <p>Gravely, he bows his way through modern music by Sofia Gubaidulina, Gyorgy Ligeti, Zoltan Kodaly and George Crumb, while the dancers pace, slide, twitch, tango and jive in perfect time. Cherkaoui adapts his style from ballroom - partnering an older woman (Marie-Louise Wilderijkx) to jitterbugging with 15-year- old Laura Neyskens. The rest of his choreography has a restricted range of vocabulary, tense and repetitive. </p> <p>He likes the formality of people moving and speaking in unison. Angelique Wilkie leads a series of tourists' tales about travelling in Morocco, every intonation echoed by other dancers. The spoken phrases, accompanied by hand-jive gestures, become as musical as the songs she sings so wistfully. Wilkie has to do the gratuitous nudity; the others try on clothes and personalities until it's time to leave the stage to the cello's keening. </p> <p>There are few touchstones for a work like this. Either you find it engaging or you don't. Many of the ingredients are familiar from other Belgian work (and from Pina Bausch's), although the performers make it seem new-minted.

After sundown, they turn into gardens of ripe, forbidden fruit. The regime of work gives away to the pursuit of pleasure. Modernism first shockingly exposed the dream life of the individual - Freud suggested that sober bourgeois citizens changed to lustful lunatics when they fell asleep - and then went on to examine the covert nocturnal revelry of entire societies. </p> <p>In 1933, Brassa\u00ef's Paris by Night revealed that the so-called city of light craved darkness, when it could abandon itself to erotic delight.

      "bodyText": "Brassa\u00ef: the Soul of Paris Hayward Gallery, London SE1 to 13 May By day, cities are factories, drearily utilitarian machines. After sundown, they turn into gardens of ripe, forbidden fruit. The regime of work gives away to the pursuit of pleasure. Modernism first shockingly exposed the dream life of the individual - Freud suggested that sober bourgeois citizens changed to lustful lunatics when they fell asleep - and then went on to examine the covert nocturnal revelry of entire societies. In 1933, Brassa\u00ef's Paris by Night revealed that the so-called city of light craved darkness, when it could abandon itself to erotic delight. Can-can dancers flashed their thighs in his book, lovers furtively canoodled on park benches and the electrified Eiffel Tower poked its glowing tip into the velvety sky. An empty sentry box outside the \u00e9cole Militaire announced the somnolence of the Freudian censor. Under Brassa\u00ef's influence, other cities let down their rational guard. Bill Brandt documented the rowdy excitements of London by Night in 1938 (and later photographed the city spectrally becalmed by the wartime blackout).

His tripod is propped on the Boulevard Saint-Jacques, with a bleary street light making the gutter shine; one of his eyes is shut, as if he were asleep on his feet, though he is merely focusing through the viewfinder.

      "body": "<p><strong> Goya: Drawings From His Private Albums </strong> Hayward Gallery, London SE1 until 13 May </p> <p> A lively old devil, in a late drawing by Goya, has stepped out to see and be seen. What a swell he is, in flamboyant hat and cape, mastering his elegant cane. What a pose he strikes, pausing mid promenade, face lifted to receive - at the very least - the admiring kiss of the sun. </p> <p>But take a closer look and the figure seems oddly unstable. The knees appear infirm, the expression bewildered, the cane scarcely erect. Something has pricked his bubble, brought him up short - a voice in his head, maybe, or a whisper in the air. It's as if he actually overhears the caption to the picture: 'You'd be making a mistake if you marry again!' </p> <p>Goya wasn't talking to himself when he wrote those words in his seventies; he never paid the slightest attention to age. At 78, he uprooted from Madrid to Bordeaux to begin a new life with his mistress, experimenting with crayons, painting on ivory and trying out the latest lithographic techniques. The only thing that stopped him in his tracks was the arrival of a grandson in 1828 - 'such joy has made me a little indisposed'. A few days later, at the age of 82, he died in his sleep. </p> <p>His energy survives in nearly 2,000 works, enough to impress Picasso himself, least humble of prolific rivals. Every jot of Picasso has been sanctified, of course, but the same is not true of his hero. Nobody alive today can claim to have seen the whole of Francisco Goya. During his lifetime, many works were suppressed or withdrawn - his political masterpiece, The Third of May, 1808, was sentenced to 40 years in storage; the etching plates for the Caprichos were impounded by the government; the Disparates were never even published. Decades after his death, some paintings still hadn't surfaced. Above all, there were the scattered drawings from his private albums, now reunited for the first time at the Hayward Gallery. </p> <p>In 1793, Goya contracted the illness that left him stone deaf. Three years into this silence, he began to draw on small sheets of paper, stitching them into journal-sized volumes. When he died, the eight volumes were dismantled and sold by the page. Some drawings have disappeared, others are only now being discovered. An amazing figure tumbling down a cliff, arms flailing, fists vainly clenched, was recently found in Marseilles. It was identified by Juliet Wilson-Bareau, curator of this exhibition. </p> <p>The show is a revelation from first to last, a marvel of richness and vitality. It gives you Goya in all his private moods - buoyant, sarcastic, impassioned, horrified, often more humorous and tender than he seems in public. They can stand the comparison, too, these little drawings, none of them much bigger than a postcard. Each image compresses the urgent power of his larger painted works; size never matters with Goya. </p> <p>Some of what you see is skimmed directly from what Goya saw on the streets - tarts in black lace, squads of cowled monks, inebriates vying for the bottle. He is impressed by an amputee in a hand-cranked go-cart and another who's harnessed a dog for the purpose. At the carnival, he wonders at the endurance of a professional giantess as the dwarfed crowds thrust pruriently at her lap. In the park, a woman's underskirt billows up into a violent squall, exposing her thighs - 'Jesus what a wind,' he exclaims. </p> <p>Or is it she? The voice of Goya's captions is often disembodied, even in his private albums. Take the man outside the brothel, one arm stuffed in his jacket, legs splayed as though too spent to walk. He's just struggling with his trousers when the surprise caption registers in his eyes: 'Good priest, where have you been celebrating mass?' </p> <p>Caught out, like the old gent, but by whom exactly - God, Goya, public gossip or the voice of his own jeering conscience? </p> <p>Goya is always described as ferociously anti-clerical, although he took good money from the church, but I'm not sure the priest is damned so much as guyed in this complex drawing. Goya never opposes preachers by preaching, nor does he tell you what to think. </p> <p>Think twice, open your mind's eye: that might be nearer to the spirit of these drawings. 'This woman was painted by Ribera... in 1640,' claims the caption to a sketch of a bearded lady. Yet there's no comparison between the two images. Ribera reduces her to little more than an alarming man in drag. Goya draws a mother gently cradling her infant, his delighted hands caught in the soft tendrils of her beard. </p> <p>It is an exquisite scene of maternal tenderness - and it imagines what Ribera couldn't bring himself to contemplate, that such a woman might be both human and loved. </p> <p>This is a world away from the clich\u00e9 of deaf-maddened Goya, candles guttering in his hat as he paints all night at the command of the sadistic witches infesting his brain. </p> <p>But everything Goya ever made counters that myth: the psychosis he described was always outside him, in the cruelties of the Inquisition, the Spanish monarchy and the Napoleonic forces that ravaged Madrid. The question is whether these particular drawings, so personal, so extensive, give you a more private Goya. </p> <p>In the most literal sense, they do reveal his hand in all its extraordinary variety. In a single show, Goya's technique seems to speed through time, from the delicate Tiepolo washes of the eighteenth century to the graphic bite of Gillray and Hogarth and right through to the Mondrian grids that steal into a final drawing. </p> <p>He uses brush tip and nib, Indian ink and black chalk; even the paper is deployed as a medium. Some lunatics sketched in darkest iron-gall may be outside the asylum but they are still imprisoned, by contrast, in the harsh white light of the page. This isn't a preliminary sketch so much as a fully finished work, which has its counterparts among Goya's paintings and etchings. The relationship is roughly that between the concentration of a poem and the range of an epic; the albums are Goya in essence. </p> <p>But there are some drawings here that seem to be in an enclave of their own, made during Goya's last years in Spain and collected in the so-called Black Border Album. These are principally single figures, holding their own on the page, without backdrop, setting or context. </p> <p>I don't know quite how they fix themselves in your imagination as permanently as they do, but neither, perhaps, did Goya. Not even the artist, he once tetchily observed, could explain 'the profound operations of the understanding'. </p> <p>An old person, neither male nor female, but somehow both, is tumbling backwards down a flight of stairs. It could be a comic scenario, a pantomime of kicking heels and billowing clothes in which dignity takes a topple. But the figure has a strange and arresting poise. Turned upside down, as is possible with an album, it appears to hover just on the verge of dropping. Even the right way up, it seems to be holding a pose, performing a skilful if terrifying feat. </p> <p>The drawing is a balancing act in its own right. It seems to tell you everything with eloquent concision and yet it sustains a mystery. There is always and endlessly more in these albums, as the drawings take hold in your mind. Goya's warning to the tumbler - 'Remember your age!' - floats in the air, unheeded and completely useless. </p> <p>Perhaps this is a character after his own heart, like so many of these great final figures - rash, stubborn, audaciously experimental and powerfully inspired to live.</p>",

His version of Berg's Wozzeck , here spelled <b> Votzek</b>, reached new levels of horror. It proved, too, the abiding relevance of Berg's work, written between 1914 and 1922 and based on B\u00fcchner's play of nearly a century earlier. The setting was a warehouse in Birmingham. The promenade production invited audiences to participate in the action. Indeed it was impossible to resist. The orchestra sat at one end in an open-sided box with its own chintzy wallpaper, the one sign of comfort. The singer-actors - for in this brilliantly cast and vigorously physical show, they were equally - moved from place to place for each of the short scenes. We followed. Through the skill of Vick's direction, Jonathan Fensom's inspired designs and Robert Jones's explicit lighting, we knew exactly where to turn, where to look. It is the best thing I've seen this year. In the middle of February that may seem empty praise. I suspect I may still say the same in December. </p> <p>Vick believes that Berg's portrayal of an oppressed and simple soldier offers a natural starting point for audiences new to opera. Hence his choice to launch the new Birmingham Opera Company, an evolution of City of Birmingham Touring Opera. Not everyone would share that view. Few operas match Wozzeck for sheer desolation and psychological travail, and in its sectional structure (Berg's original has 15 scenes) it departs from most examples of the form. Musically, too, with its ravishing orchestral interludes and absence of conventional arias, its methods are hardly typical. It does, however, have extraordinary emotional impact. It also lends itself perfectly to the grand-scale community event achieved here. A core group of 40 people - with additional performers from an Asian young people's theatre, a pensioners' group and local colleges - transformed themselves into prostitutes and psychiatrists, housewives and disco dancers, a Car-Crash Victim and a Mannequin Obsessive Raver. As Votzek and Marie, Andrew Slater and Tara Harrison were, quite simply, exemplary. If they were film stars, they would deserve Oscars. Ronald Samm, Andrew Forbes-Lane, Keel Watson and others gave committed support. John Rea's skilful reduction of the score to 21 players, Tim Lole's conducting and the expert playing of the musicians completed this enthralling evening. </p> <p>In a different spirit, <b> London Royal Schools Opera</b>'s double bill 'of ingenious lovers' also proved how lively British operatic life is, even - or especially - at conservatoire level. Bizet's inane Le Docteur Miracle and Rossini's zany Il Signor Bruschino made ideal companion pieces. Rossini's 1813 work, the more substantial of the two, had a disastrous first performance in Venice and was then withdrawn. The dizzy plot loops an incomprehensible cat's cradle of confusion with mistaken identity at the heart. Signor Bruschino's dissolute son has been promised to his old friend's daughter but she is in love with another. Bruschino is tricked, almost to the point of cruelty, into thinking the lover is his son, though he gets his revenge in the end. Rossini's approach is not as dark as Berg's, but in its bizarre fizziness can be almost as disturbing. </p> <p>The score is capricious and witty, its playfulness evident from the start. In the sprightly overture, violinists are instructed to beat their music stands with the wood of their bows in rat-a-tat-tat fashion. Throughout, the music stutters and murmurs, sighs and groans in parody of the self-important characters. One early complaint was that, with so many similar word-endings ('-ito, -ito, -ito' or 'mio, mio, mio'), no one could not understand what was going on. That was precisely Rossini's aim. Singers and orchestra alike, conducted by Iain Ledingham, were crisp and precise, with special praise to Pier rick Boisseau, Natalie Raybould, Christopher Dixon and Gardar Th\u00f3r Cortes. </p> <p>Bizet wrote Le Docteur Miracle when he was only 18. Nearly half the work consists of spoken dialogue, deftly delivered in French by the versatile cast. Again the plot spins on mistaken identity and marriage. The mayor's daughter wants to marry a soldier, Silvio. Her father objects. Silvio disguises himself as a cook in order to get into his loved one's house. He prepares a foul-tasting omelette for the family, then tells the mayor it is poisoned, later returning dressed up as Dr Miracle and promising a cure in return for the daughter's hand. </p> <p>Robert Chevara, who directed both these high-spirited productions, achieved levity and clarity, aided by Emma Cattell's fresh, witty designs and Bruno Poet's lighting. All four singers (Emma Gane, Trine M\u00f8ller, Matthias Hausmann, David Murphy) had been admirably coached in voice and language. The great centrepiece of this operatic souffl\u00e9 is a mock-solemn quartet in homage to the omelette, 'Voici l'omelette', here sung with ardour and panache. As sure as eggs is eggs, these talented young performers will soon be poached. </p> <p> Further performances of Votzek at Aircraft Hangar No 2, Speke Road, Liverpool L24 on 9 and 10 March; Concord Sports Centre, Sheffield on 23 &amp; 24 March; then in Porto, Portugal, European City of Culture 2001, 6 &amp;7 April</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Richard Ashcroft</strong> Brixton Academy, London SW9 </p> <p> 'I want people to see my solo shows and for it to be like seeing Elvis for the first time,' Richard Ashcroft pronounced in a recent interview. As he launched into 'Brave New World', a track from his debut solo album Alone With Everybody, at the Brixton Academy last Wednesday, the crowd's response suggested his vaunting aspirations may not be all that far off the mark. </p> <p>The former face of The Verve appeared incongruously casual, mooching with his guitar in leather jacket and jeans in front of a grandiose backing band under a psychedelic lightshow that would have made Jean-Michel Jarre look cheap, but this is what his solo album is all about: the marriage of Ashcroft, alone and unadorned, with a new musical vision on a grand, orchestral scale. While retaining the services of Verve drummer Pete Salisbury, Ashcroft has surrounded himself with an impressive array of musicians in a line up that included four members of London Community Gospel Choir singing backing vocals in addition to trumpet, saxophone, bass, pedal steel and two keyboards. </p> <p>Wisely, bearing in mind that most of his fans have stayed loyal because he's the only operational fragment of The Verve they once loved, he alternated material from the new album with favourite songs from Urban Hymns. The valedictory Verve album was originally intended as Ashcroft's first solo project, but was eventually recorded with the band because, as he said later, 'I didn't want to put a stop on The Verve. It was in the air still. There was unfinished business'. Far from the hyperdriven, drug-fuelled blitzes of the band's recording sessions, though, with a successful new album and a new son, Ashcroft appeared more than anything to be having fun up there, moving between past and present with 'Lucky Man' and 'Sonnet' and on into 'I Get My Beat'. Watching him enjoying the crowd's excitement, calling out 'Thank you for your fucking love' to whoops and screams, it seemed hard to believe that one of the reasons suggested for The Verve's split was their inability to cope with the scale of their success; Ashcroft in his new incarnation appeared to thrive on it. </p> <p>The new material exhibits Ashcroft's eminent talents as a songwriter; the songs are calmer and brighter, missing the fury and darkness that marked the earlier albums, A Northern Soul in particular. His lyrics are still characterised by a questing poetry, but songs such as 'On A Beach', or 'Come On People (We're Makin' It Now)' are full of optimism, transparently the work of a man who's arrived in a new place after a rough ride, in love with life and, more specifically, with his wife Kate, who made a guest appearance on keyboards and to whom the album is dedicated. </p> <p>A mellow, country flavour has seeped into the still-recognisable big psychedelic soul sounds, aided by the fluid slide of the pedal steel (played by BJ Cole, who also guested on The Verve's final tour after the departure of Nick McCabe). In the ballads a new tenderness has replaced the manic soul-wringing of the Verve days. </p> <p>Halfway through, the band left Ashcroft alone in a spotlight for a trio of ballads that the crowd couldn't jump about or sing along to; the downward shift in tempo failed to hold their attention entirely, and for a while the conversations around us threatened to grow louder than the music. There was a muted appreciation when he sang 'Everybody', a haunting song about accepting death, which works as a kind of sequel to 'The Drugs Don't Work' ('Everybody's got to feel the weight of death sometimes/Find out how it feels to be left behind'), immediately after which the band returned, as did the lasers, strobes and glitterballs, and he plunged straight into 'The Drugs Don't Work' to frenzied applause, as if charting his psychic process in reverse. </p> <p>He followed it with 'A Song For The Lovers' and then 'New York', the beefiest song on the album and sure to be remembered as a great Ashcroft anthem, drawing it out with a crazed pedal steel solo over the crunching rhythm section as the light show turned hallucinogenic. </p> <p>As if closing the circle, Ashcroft returned to play as his encore 'History', from A Northern Soul, his voice still surprisingly pure and vigorous after nearly two hours on stage. But it was his final song that had the audience bellowing out the lyrics and punching the air. 'This is a little song called \"Bittersweet Symphony\",' he yelled over the familiar swell of the strings; though it was curious to hear the pedal steel taking the place of Nick McCabe's frenetic guitar, it was still the one the audience had been waiting for. Ashcroft's solo career may be marking a new direction for his music, but it will still be some time before anything has the same effect on his fans as that one song.</p>",

The former face of The Verve appeared incongruously casual, mooching with his guitar in leather jacket and jeans in front of a grandiose backing band under a psychedelic lightshow that would have made Jean-Michel Jarre look cheap, but this is what his solo album is all about: the marriage of Ashcroft, alone and unadorned, with a new musical vision on a grand, orchestral scale. While retaining the services of Verve drummer Pete Salisbury, Ashcroft has surrounded himself with an impressive array of musicians in a line up that included four members of London Community Gospel Choir singing backing vocals in addition to trumpet, saxophone, bass, pedal steel and two keyboards. Wisely, bearing in mind that most of his fans have stayed loyal because he's the only operational fragment of The Verve they once loved, he alternated material from the new album with favourite songs from Urban Hymns. The valedictory Verve album was originally intended as Ashcroft's first solo project, but was eventually recorded with the band because, as he said later, 'I didn't want to put a stop on The Verve. It was in the air still. There was unfinished business'. Far from the hyperdriven, drug-fuelled blitzes of the band's recording sessions, though, with a successful new album and a new son, Ashcroft appeared more than anything to be having fun up there, moving between past and present with 'Lucky Man' and 'Sonnet' and on into 'I Get My Beat'. Watching him enjoying the crowd's excitement, calling out 'Thank you for your fucking love' to whoops and screams, it seemed hard to believe that one of the reasons suggested for The Verve's split was their inability to cope with the scale of their success; Ashcroft in his new incarnation appeared to thrive on it. The new material exhibits Ashcroft's eminent talents as a songwriter; the songs are calmer and brighter, missing the fury and darkness that marked the earlier albums, A Northern Soul in particular. His lyrics are still characterised by a questing poetry, but songs such as 'On A Beach', or 'Come On People (We're Makin' It Now)' are full of optimism, transparently the work of a man who's arrived in a new place after a rough ride, in love with life and, more specifically, with his wife Kate, who made a guest appearance on keyboards and to whom the album is dedicated. A mellow, country flavour has seeped into the still-recognisable big psychedelic soul sounds, aided by the fluid slide of the pedal steel (played by BJ Cole, who also guested on The Verve's final tour after the departure of Nick McCabe). In the ballads a new tenderness has replaced the manic soul-wringing of the Verve days. Halfway through, the band left Ashcroft alone in a spotlight for a trio of ballads that the crowd couldn't jump about or sing along to; the downward shift in tempo failed to hold their attention entirely, and for a while the conversations around us threatened to grow louder than the music. There was a muted appreciation when he sang 'Everybody', a haunting song about accepting death, which works as a kind of sequel to 'The Drugs Don't Work' ('Everybody's got to feel the weight of death sometimes/Find out how it feels to be left behind'), immediately after which the band returned, as did the lasers, strobes and glitterballs, and he plunged straight into 'The Drugs Don't Work' to frenzied applause, as if charting his psychic process in reverse. He followed it with 'A Song For The Lovers' and then 'New York', the beefiest song on the album and sure to be remembered as a great Ashcroft anthem, drawing it out with a crazed pedal steel solo over the crunching rhythm section as the light show turned hallucinogenic. As if closing the circle, Ashcroft returned to play as his encore 'History', from A Northern Soul, his voice still surprisingly pure and vigorous after nearly two hours on stage. But it was his final song that had the audience bellowing out the lyrics and punching the air. 'This is a little song called \"Bittersweet Symphony\",' he yelled over the familiar swell of the strings; though it was curious to hear the pedal steel taking the place of Nick McCabe's frenetic guitar, it was still the one the audience had been waiting for. Ashcroft's solo career may be marking a new direction for his music, but it will still be some time before anything has the same effect on his fans as that one song.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Port Authority</strong> New Ambassadors, London WC2 <br><strong> Playboy of the Western World </strong> Cottesloe, London SE1<br><strong> Mister Heracles</strong> West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds </p> <p> The talent in Conor McPherson's new play exposes a weird rift in English publishing. In the country which considers Shakespeare its greatest writer, here's a work by a major writer which will never be considered for a major literary prize, because the writer is a dramatist. McPherson's new play - buoyed up by his storytelling flair and gift for skewering detail - is alive with subtle shifts, vivid with really good jokes. His sentences are better, his sentiments more developed and shaded than many Booker Prize-winners. He is terrific. </p> <p>Actually he's so accomplished in a literary way that this production, directed by McPherson, raises questions. Why exactly is <strong> Port Authority</strong> on the stage as well as on the page? How much is added by hearing rather than reading the three narratives which make up this tale? What's gained by seeing them spoken, by actors obliged to stand, isolated and scarcely moving, in front of a gently changing skyscape, as if they were taking part in a verse-speaking competition? </p> <p>McPherson - who at 29 has already earned himself a place in theatrical history as the author of that spellbinding West End success The Weir - has often been called a writer of monologues, as if this were something mere. In fact, his almost single-handed reinvention of the dramatic monologue has been a triumph. But in Port Authority he has stretched the form until it's cracked. </p> <p>In interspersed speeches - there are 15 scenes in this 90-minute piece - three generations of Dublin men disclose their life histories, each centred on a romance. A 20-year-old - played with a fine, nervy, would-be nonchalance by Eanna MacLiam - talks of trying to leave home, and of failing to get off with his soul mate. A middle-aged husband - given just the right degree of unconvincing, gin-sodden bravado by Stephen Brennan - describes a riotous excursion and his retreat to the wife he's affected to disdain. Jim Norton seductively reprises the role he played powerfully in The Weir: the beguiling, curmudgeonly old sod who thinks he's lost out on a great love. </p> <p>Lightly bound together by a few plot strands, these stories are not so much interwoven as layered: one lament lies on top of another as if to form a mulch of male grief. The result is arresting, and non-dynamic. It causes actors to do unusual things to assert themselves. On the opening night, Norton, huddled up in his cardy and lopsided smile, confided to the audience that although he'd behaved meanly, someone liked him 'too much to give me a hard time'. So doefully cajoling was he that a member of the audience burst out with a big sigh of joking compassion. And so in tune was Norton that he batted the sigh back with a confident nod and grunt - as if he were doing stand-up. An equivocal moment that: a moment when a character became a turn, and a set-piece burst its boundaries. </p> <p>No chance of that at the Cottesloe, where Fiona Buffini's production of <strong>The Playboy of the Western World</strong> preserves this once controversial play in the aspic of reverence, and in doing so makes it look absurd. J.M. Synge's Aran Island story of the silver-tongued boy who wins the hearts of strangers with his account of parricide (rather in the way McPherson's characters wow us with their tales of adultery) is literally rendered. Robert Jones's design is strong and beautiful: a shebeen with a smoking chimney and grey flint stretching to the feet of the stalls; Patrick O'Kane - an animated Francis Bacon canvas - gives a visceral performance as the playboy: he makes you feel you can see through his skin. But there's not a glimmer of the sexual and political danger which enraged people at the Abbey in 1907: its all shawls and bogs and bare feet and open faces. </p> <p>'Would anyone kill his father if he was able to help it?' asked the Aran islanders whom Synge considered guided by 'primitive feeling'. Two and a half millennia earlier, Euripides had asked the same question in <strong> Heracles</strong>, now staged in a new version at West Yorkshire Playhouse. </p> <p>It was ingenious of the young director Simon Godwin to get another Simon - the poet Armitage - to recreate Euripides's switchback story, in which a minute is enough to turn an idol into a criminal, a rightful avenger into a motiveless butcher, purposeful action into frenzied destruction. The drama's closing moments testify to distinctively - and admirable - Grecian values concerning stoicism in adversity and the healing hand of friendship. The issues in the play look white-hot: does the violence of warfare incite soldiers to other sorts of violence? Where are you when you are going mad? Whos's to blame for the crimes committed by the insane? </p> <p>Our hero returns home after performing fabulous feats around the globe, and rescues his family from impending slaughter. No sooner has he done so than he goes mad and is given an electronic adrenaline shot, according to Armitage. He turns on his wife and children and kills them; just as he's about to dispatch his dad, he keels over. Coming to, he thinks of himself - in the most illuminating moment of Armitage's adaptation - as 'a disease', as something let loose on itself. You could consider him a virus. </p> <p>But you're asked to consider too many possibilities here for any notion to take flight. The play's varied idioms - casual, compressed, metaphorical, instructive - war with each other. Only the occasional pulse makes the lines easy to speak: the actors are uniformly wooden. The production is so awash with visual ideas - a sequence in outer space moving towards a queasy final reference to 'personal space' - that the narrative is swamped. It may be that two directors - Godwin and Natasha Betteridge have worked together on this - are too many. It's certain that an incisive idea has been engulfed in a fog of words and pictures.</p>",

Murray Abraham, Anna Paquin <br><strong> The Invisible Circus</strong> (98 mins, 15) Directed by Adam Brooks; starring Cameron Diaz, Christopher Eccleston, Jordana Brewster </p> <p>Both of this week's big-budget Hollywood movies turn upon young blacks assisting in the redemption of reclusive, once celebrated middle-class whites who have lost their sense of purpose and direction. What this tells you about present-day America is hard to say, though significantly, for all the positive thinking they represent, neither has attracted a single Oscar nomination or done well at the box office. </p> <p>Robert Redford's <strong>The Legend of Bagger Vance</strong> is set in the Deep South at the time when the Ku Klux Klan was burning crosses with impunity and a decade before Hollywood happily acquiesced when the world premiere of Gone with the Wind took place in Atlanta before an all-white audience from which the black actors were excluded. But the film's Deep South, despite it being 1930 with the Depression setting in, is that old melon-eating, magnolia-sniffing world where a blacked-up Al Jolson waited for Robert E. Lee, not the land of lynch mobs where, with the participation of the American Medical Association, syphilitic blacks were given placebos so that white doctors could study the progress of the disease. </p> <p>The movie is narrated by the 82-year-old golf pro Hardy Greaves (an uncredited Jack Lemmon) who looks back to his golded-hued youth in Georgia when golf was his religion and his great hero the patrician local star Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon). A pre-First World War champion, Junuh's been living in boozy seclusion for 12 years since his traumatic experiences as an infantry officer in France. Proud Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) has a problem - her rich daddy embarked on building a great golf links course at Savannah, Georgia, before the Depression hit and then committed suicide. To preserve the family honour, she refuses to sell up and decides to risk all on a grand opening with a $10,000 exhibition match between America's two greatest golfers, Georgia's own scholarly Bobby Jones and the swaggering, womanising Walter Hagen. Both men respond to the irresistible siren peals of this Southern belle, but a local contestant is needed and the 11-year-old Hardy suggests that Rannulph Junuh is the man. The problem is - how to lure him back to the links after a dozen years away? </p> <p>Well, before you can say caddie shack or Uncle Tom's Cabin, a handsome, smooth-talking young black called Bagger Vance (Will Smith) strolls out of the dark knowing all about Junuh, golf and life. Maybe things were different back in 1930 when blacks in Georgia didn't dare roam at night on whitey's side of the tracks, or work as a caddie or talk out of line. But movie audiences will twig him for what he is - an angel who knows all the greens and bunkers of life. 'You lost your swing, you got to go find it,' he tells Junuh, and soon our hero is on his way to salvation and victory, as well as a reunion with Adele, who just happens to be his pre-war lover who's been keeping herself for him ever since. </p> <p>Back in 1984, Redford appeared in The Natural, a complex film of transgression and redemption based on Bernard Malamud's fictional reworking of the Arthurian legend in the world of professional baseball. It was magical and uplifting, two qualities quite lacking in the flat, dispiriting Bagger Vance, though all too clearly what we're supposed to be watching is the story of life itself. The angelic Vance is full of stoical and Zen-like platitudes about golf - 'a game that can't be won, only played', 'the point when everything becomes one' etc. The most memorably awful line, however, is given to golfing star Bobby Jones. Hearing that young Hardy is ashamed of his dad who, refusing to go bankrupt after his store failed, chooses to work as a street-cleaner to pay off his debts, Jones says earnestly: 'Your dad stared adversity in the eyes, Hardy. He beat it back with a broom.' </p> <p>The black redeemer in Gus Van Sant's <strong>Finding Forrester</strong> is the handsome 16-year-old Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown), a brilliant autodidact and basketball star from a housing project in the Bronx who accidentally stumbles into the Salinger-like hermitage of the 70-year-old William Forrester (Sean Connery) Literary abstinence in the movies is regarded as a badge of heroic integrity, and Forrester hasn't published a book since his legendary first novel, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Avalon Landing, apparently because he thought he'd exploited his war veteran brother (another echo of Bagger Vance). Their meeting comes just as Jamal has been snapped up by an exclusive preparatory school in Manhattan where he's befriended by a pretty upper-class girl (Anna Paquin) and becomes the target of an envious teacher, the failed writer Robert Crawford (F. Murray Abraham). </p> <p>You may have recognised the resem blance of this plot to that of Good Will Hunting. Gus Van Sant clearly did, for he pays homage to his earlier film by giving its star and author Matt Damon a walk-on role as Forrester's lawyer. The movie is a contrived, smug affair, infinitely inferior to Wonder Boys, which touches on similar literary themes. But if it has a plus it's that, despite the waffle he's given to speak (eg 'You write your first draft from the heart, you re-write with your mind'), Connery can never appear as sentimental or foolish as Robin Williams. Among much that's silly about the literary life in this film is a page from a 1960 New Yorker bearing the title of an article by Forrester, with his name and portrait - New Yorker pieces are never accompanied by pictures of their authors, and until the coming of Tina Brown, the writer's name always appeared at the end. </p> <p>I try to engage movies with an open mind, but reading that Adam Brooks's <strong>The Invisible Circus</strong> was directed by the man who wrote the scripts for Beloved, Practical Magic and French Kiss made my heart sink. It sank further as the 18-year-old Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) left 1977 San Francisco to investigate the last days of her sister Faith (Cameron Diaz), a Sixties flower child and campus radical who touched various counter-cultural bases in Europe before her mysterious suicide in Portugal in 1971. This is as bad an attempt as there's lately been to examine the 1960s ethos, and it contains a terrible performance by Christopher Eccleston as Faith's former lover, an ex-hippie who spends his time pouring new whines into old battles.</p>",

Among much that's silly about the literary life in this film is a page from a 1960 New Yorker bearing the title of an article by Forrester, with his name and portrait - New Yorker pieces are never accompanied by pictures of their authors, and until the coming of Tina Brown, the writer's name always appeared at the end. I try to engage movies with an open mind, but reading that Adam Brooks's The Invisible Circus was directed by the man who wrote the scripts for Beloved, Practical Magic and French Kiss made my heart sink. It sank further as the 18-year-old Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) left 1977 San Francisco to investigate the last days of her sister Faith (Cameron Diaz), a Sixties flower child and campus radical who touched various counter-cultural bases in Europe before her mysterious suicide in Portugal in 1971. This is as bad an attempt as there's lately been to examine the 1960s ethos, and it contains a terrible performance by Christopher Eccleston as Faith's former lover, an ex-hippie who spends his time pouring new whines into old battles.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Liam</strong> (91 mins, 15) Directed by Stephen Frears; starring Ian Hart, Claire Hackett, Anthony Borrows, Jane Gurnett </p> <p>After two memorable, sharply contrasting American movies - the western, Hi-Lo Country , and the urban comedy, High Fidelity - Stephen Frears has returned to Britain with Liam, a tough, anti-nostalgic period movie. Frears began his directorial career 30 years ago with Gumshoe, a sprightly comedy-thriller set in a confident Beatles-era Liverpool. His new film is located in a very different prewar Merseyside and is written by an altogether more aggressive Liverpool author, Jimmy McGovern, who wrote the gritty Priest and the Cracker series. </p> <p> Liam is situated between, and obviously influenced by, some notable British films of a couple of years back that also draw on childhood memories of Liverpool. On the one hand, there is Terence Davies's trilogy, Distant Voices, Still Lives and The Long Day Closes, about a lonely, working-class Catholic boy with a brutal father growing up in the 1940s and 1950s in a world dominated by women and finding consolation in movies and popular music. On the other is Ken Loach's Land and Freedom, in which an unemployed Liverpool docker, played by Ian Hart, turns his seething political anger to positive purposes by volunteering to serve with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. </p> <p> Liam is largely seen through the eyes of its eponymous seven-year-old hero (Anthony Borrows) and has the elliptical, slightly abstract quality of Davies's film. Its dominant male character, a working-class father played by Ian Hart, faces the same political options as the protagonist of Land and Freedom, though they make radically different choices. </p> <p> Liam begins on New Year's Eve, traditionally a moment of hope. But this is Liverpool in the early years of the Depression, a drab, killjoy time with the threat of imminent unemployment hovering in the poisonous air. A pompous policeman intimidates children outside a pub and then reduces their singing parents inside to silence by his mere appearance; the bar is not licensed for music and dancing. As the New Year celebrations extend into the early hours, the shape of social fissures to come is forecast in a nasty row between two women, one Catholic, the other Protestant, who have to be parted. A father looks proudly on as his elder son vomits in the backyard after his first bout of manly drinking. </p> <p>Thereafter, a visually and dramatically schematic film is punctuated by the image of fire, real and imagined. Dad is still at work and white-hot rivets are hammered into ships in a dry dock. Little Liam is being prepared for his first communion and his first confession at a primitive parochial school where a female teacher and a bullying priest drill into him the fear of hellfire. </p> <p>Just before a copy of the Liverpool Post goes up in flames while drawing a morning fire, we read headlines of dole queues and Ramsay MacDonald's coalition government. Liam sees hell in the road-menders' brazier and the blacksmith's furnace and, in the climactic scene, by a terrible, melodramatic irony, a human being is turned into a blazing torch. </p> <p>Dad is soon laid off, becomes obsessed with scabs and cheap labour from Ireland and rants against Jewish exploiters. Liam is tortured by an induced sense of sin (seeing his mother naked is a traumatic experience), feels guilty about the suffering around him and his already chronic stammer, one of the most convincing I have ever seen or heard in a film, becomes paralytic. His 14-year-old sister, Theresa (Megan Burns), goes into service with a well-off Jewish family, who own the dock where Dad worked, and she finds herself carrying messages between her employer's wife and her young lover. </p> <p>Liam's mother (Claire Hackett), a devout Catholic, desperately tries to hold the family together. But finally she turns on her husband when he goes berserk and denounces the church's venality during Liam's first communion and then becomes a militant member of Oswald Mosley's Blackshirts. Like his communist opposite number in Land and Freedom, he ends up crushed and disillusioned. </p> <p>This is heady, uncompromising stuff that hits you at gut level, often below the belt in the way McGovern's Priest did. The performances have a raw humanity that makes us feel sympathy for Dad, even when he goes beyond the pale. But the subjective viewpoints, whether Liam's, Theresa's or Dad's, make it impossible to view this narrowly conceived section of society with anything approaching objectivity. I'm also more than a trifle uneasy about the way the perceived exploiters - the dock owner, the pawnbroker, the rent collector - are all Jews. I'm also not convinced that a Blackshirt speaker would attack the Irish; from the start, the Mosleyites attracted a lot of support from anti-communist Catholics and stood behind Franco in 1936. </p> <p>It is, however, a powerful movie about divisive issues that were kept from our screens at the time by the British Board of Film Censors. The most hard-hitting play of the decade, Love on the Dole, couldn't be filmed until 1941, by which time it was history. </p> <p> Liam touched on deep, personal feelings for me. I grew up on Merseyside in the 1930s and 40s, all the members of my father's family worked in the docks or went to sea, and as Protestants they never spoke to their slightly better-off Catholic relatives. Anti-Semitism was rife among my parents' friends and at my school, and I recall that when at the 1945 general election the Labour Party put up a Jewish lawyer (a KC called Voss) against the incumbent Tory, Sir Malcolm Bullock, in Crosby, a local councillor said at a public meeting: 'I think I can rely upon you all to vote Conservative, but anyway I cannot believe you would vote for a Jew.' </p> <p>At that time, I had a chronic, almost disabling stammer, like Liam's. But in 1948, when I moved to Bristol with my parents, I had Jewish schoolfriends for the first time, I began to read Catholic writers and in this fresh, new air my stammer began steadily to abate, though it was never to disappear.</p>",

      "body": "<p>About ten years ago I remember my mother telling me that she and another very good looking friend in her early fifties had decided that they had reached the state of invisibility. I didn't understand because at the time I was more concerned with different kinds of female invisibility, the kind where you take your clothes off and the man you live with doesn't lift his eyes from his book, or someone you have just met turns away from you when you answer the question 'and what do you do?' by telling him that you have just had a baby or are looking after small children.</p> <p>Now a decade on I am beginning to understand what my mother meant. My own visibility is becoming a bit blurry. I used to be able to turn it on and off at will but now I feel as though I'm going permanently out of focus. I've started to notice small things, like men in cars not stopping for me on zebra crossings, and not looking up as I enter a room . I'm able to pass building sites without the old dread of being jeered at and commented upon.</p> <p>Doing some work lately for a woman's magazine, I was asked to find real-life cases, with photographs, to illustrate an article. The editor stressed strongly that the cut-off age for interviewees was 35. As I am 37, I realised that for her and the glossy world she inhabits, I had become someone no longer fit to be seen. Glamour magazine, launching next month, makes it perfectly clear: it says it's for 'women who are 27, yearn to be 27 or wish they were 27 still'.</p> <p>I am obviously travelling fast towards the moment Germaine Greer described as 'when the older woman suddenly realises that she can no longer trade on her appearance, something which she has done unconsciously all her life'.</p> <p>My mother is a good example of an 'unconscious trader' because there has never been anything about the way she dresses or behaves which seemed designed to attract the attention of men.</p> <p>Nevertheless, watching a video recently that she'd made from all the cinefilm of our childhood holidays I saw playing with us on various beaches a woman of outstanding beauty and grace. There was no doubt about it: Mum was a babe (why didn't we inherit it, my sister and I asked each other?) That's why she noticed when male eyes stopped noticing her. And although she had never particularly sought their gaze she was not quite sure about how she felt now it was gone. It was a noticeable shift in her life, touched with a sense of regret, a sort of 'oh well, alright, I've got to that stage then'.</p> <p>The episode that really made me think about my own impending invisibility was a holiday with another family, including a girl of 15 and her 'best, best' friend. Acutely aware of the gaze of others, these young teenage girls were both excited and disturbed by the amount of male admiration they received. Although perfectly ordinary-looking, they were kind and innocent, yet sexually curious - and miniskirt-wearing, all of which had local men of all ages salivating with hope and desire.</p> <p>The girls would listen politely to the rambling chat-ups, and then when asked if they wanted to come home/go clubbing/have a snog they would run away or ask me to help them disengage from an awkward situation. I was happy to act as chaperone because I remember how confusing it all was. I was also rather bemused to realise that I had come this far from being, like them, the centre of so much testosterone-fuelled attention.</p> <p>The novelist Esther Freud, whose novel Peerless Flats has a young teenage heroine unable to decide whether she wants to embrace the visibility her sister so obviously enjoys or hide away, says: 'I felt awkward with that kind of attention when I was a teenager and in my early twenties. I used to wear rather drab and shapeless clothes and not wash my hair because I wanted people to have to look beyond my appearance and make an effort to find something deeper and more interesting within. I also wanted to have control over how and when I was looked at and by whom. Later you can learn to be visible when you want to be and invisible when you need to be without having to wear camouflage, but that probably comes when you are less self-conscious and more involved in other people and other things.'</p> <p>For similar reasons, perhaps, striking women like Germaine Greer and my mother, for whom male attention went beyond daily gallantries and could sometimes be a nuisance, are able (after the initial feelings of surprise and regret) to see some advantages in moving to this different stage of life. There is a freedom in not being watched - and in being able to do some watching. As the writer Carolyn Heilbrun put it, 'to relearn seeing and to forget being seen'.</p> <p>Others who were less visible when they were young find the shift works in reverse. The actress Liz Smith, who was not taken on by an agent until she was 50, always 'crept around and slipped into roles, never playing the romantic lead'. Now she has more work than she has ever had in her life. 'I am starting to play strong, sinister characters which I find extremely interesting.' Of those actresses who try to cling to their youth, she says: 'I feel sad for them, the ones who have little marks and tucks on their necks because they are trying to stay as they were, but of course they can't do that.'</p> <p>But if you were once defined as 'a beauty' it can be especially hard to fade from sight. Cora Whitely is 70. 'I modelled when I was young and married two wealthy older men who were obsessed by the way I looked. I noticed that I had become invisible when I was about 50 and it took me about five years to get over it. Do you know that even now if a man catcalls from a car or a van I am rather surprised that it is not at me but at some young girl standing next to me. Perhaps I will never get used to it.'</p> <p>Gina Duncan, 54, who has two teenage daughters, says, 'I might not have minded so much if my girls' absolute peak had not come at the very same time that I was becoming menopausal. Sometimes when I walk down the street with them men seem to bang into me, to push me aside, or trample on me in an effort to take another look at my daughters and that can be very demoralising. Of course I don't expect people to look at me with desire but I didn't quite expect to be pushed aside like that.'</p> <p>Was that what it was all about? When my friends' mothers used to scream about their 'tarty clothes' and 'too much make-up', and tell them that they couldn't go out looking like that, was it simply a mixture of fear and jealousy?</p> <p>Looking at my six-year-old daughter I can't help feeling intense pride at her beauty and yet don't want too many people to comment on it in case she becomes self-conscious and self-regarding. I don't want her to see herself through other people's eyes, to become what John Berger described as a woman who watches herself being looked at - 'the surveyor of woman in herself is male; the surveyed female - an object of vision; a sight'.</p> <p>I hope also that when my daughter hits her visible teenage years I will not be one of those mothers who borrows her clothes or flirts with her boyfriend. Please let me be a gracious mother like my own, ready to pass on the baton of visibility while helping her by my own example to see that just because you stop being visible you do not have to disappear.</p> <p>As my 85-year-old grandmother, who demands attention by the sheer force of her personality, said: 'Invisible?

      "body": "<p>Deciding you want to invest in an investment trust is one thing. Choosing the right one is quite another.</p> <p>There are about 600 investment trusts to choose from, with objectives ranging from capital growth to high income, and taking advantage of investment opportunities worldwide. </p> <p>So which trusts are the flavour of the month with independent financial advisers (IFAs)?</p> <p>Jason Hollands, deputy managing director of Best Investment, favours RIT Capital Partners, an investment trust from the Rothschild stable which aims to achieve pure capital growth by investing mainly in international equities.</p> <p>'The lion's share of the portfolio is very diversified, with a broad spread across all industries and managed by Michael Sofaer,' says Hollands.</p> <p>According to Hollands, the trust, currently valued at about \u00a3732 million, has outperformed its sector average despite a change of manager 12 months ago. 'At the time of the change of manager, we took the decision to put the trust on hold, until we could see how things were going,' he says. 'But since the change, we have been delighted with the trust's performance.'</p> <p>The share price of the trust is currently at a discount of about 10 per cent to the net asset value of the trust, which means investors can buy shares at a cheaper price than they are actually worth.</p> <p>Patrick Connolly, associate director at Bath firm Chartwell Investment Management, recommends the Witan fund, run by Henderson Global Investors. It's a large international general fund, with a diversified portfolio of holdings designed for maximum capital growth. 'We use the trust as a core holding for many clients,' says Connolly. 'It is one fund that we are happy to buy and hold forever.'</p> <p>The fund, managed by James Robinson, draws on the experience of all Henderson's regional investment teams, with specialists in each geographic area managing the assets in that region.</p> <p>It is currently valued at about \u00a31.98 billion and, according to Connolly, has achieved consistent performance, despite last year's poor showing on the equity markets. Over the past five years, the return on the fund has been 96.5 per cent. 'Even over the past 12 months, the fund has returned 8.2 per cent,' he says.</p> <p>'The trust is never likely to produce spectacular returns, but will remain a solid performer,' says Connolly. 'It is ideal as a core holding, on which a novice investor can build a portfolio.'</p> <p>Anna Bowes, savings and investments manager at Chase de Vere Investments, chooses the Fidelity Special Values investment trust as her current favourite.</p> <p>This trust aims for above- average long-term capital growth by investing mainly in smaller and medium-sized UK companies in 'special situations'. These could be companies recovering from financially difficult periods, or stocks currently out of favour with investors.</p> <p>'When we look for investment trusts for our clients, we want good, sturdy funds with good management,' says Bowes. 'We look at trusts that have shown good returns, even in turbulent times.'</p> <p>Anthony Bolton, who has an 'investment guru' reputation in the market, manages the trust, which is currently valued at about \u00a390 million. According to Bowes, the performance has been very good. 'It has achieved growth of 158 per cent over the past five years,' she says. 'It has outperformed its sector by 68 per cent.'</p> <p>Robert Graham, an associate partner at Scottish Financial Independence Group, likes the Scottish Mortgage investment trust, which is managed by Baillie Gifford.</p> <p>The trust aims to achieve maximum growth in capital value and dividends by investing internationally, mainly in listed securities. 'The trust has been very good at getting the assets where growth occurs,' says Graham.</p> <p>The fund, valued at about \u00a31.8 billion, is managed by James Anderson and currently trades at a discount of about 13.2 per cent. The yield is quoted at 1.4 per cent. </p> <p>Graham points out that, over the past five years, the trust has returned 77.4 per cent, although last year was a difficult one with a loss of about 6 per cent. </p> <p>However, because of the poor return in 2000, Graham believes there is growth potential for the future. 'I like a good fund that has had a poorish year,' he says.</p> <p><strong>Contacts</strong></p> <p><strong>J Rothschild</strong> 0207 493 811</p> <p><strong>Henderson Global </strong>0800 106106</p> <p><strong>Fidelity </strong>0800 414124</p> <p><strong>Baillie Gifford </strong>0800 027 0133</p>",

There are about 600 investment trusts to choose from, with objectives ranging from capital growth to high income, and taking advantage of investment opportunities worldwide. So which trusts are the flavour of the month with independent financial advisers (IFAs)? Jason Hollands, deputy managing director of Best Investment, favours RIT Capital Partners, an investment trust from the Rothschild stable which aims to achieve pure capital growth by investing mainly in international equities. 'The lion's share of the portfolio is very diversified, with a broad spread across all industries and managed by Michael Sofaer,' says Hollands. According to Hollands, the trust, currently valued at about \u00a3732 million, has outperformed its sector average despite a change of manager 12 months ago. 'At the time of the change of manager, we took the decision to put the trust on hold, until we could see how things were going,' he says. 'But since the change, we have been delighted with the trust's performance.' The share price of the trust is currently at a discount of about 10 per cent to the net asset value of the trust, which means investors can buy shares at a cheaper price than they are actually worth. Patrick Connolly, associate director at Bath firm Chartwell Investment Management, recommends the Witan fund, run by Henderson Global Investors. It's a large international general fund, with a diversified portfolio of holdings designed for maximum capital growth. 'We use the trust as a core holding for many clients,' says Connolly. 'It is one fund that we are happy to buy and hold forever.' The fund, managed by James Robinson, draws on the experience of all Henderson's regional investment teams, with specialists in each geographic area managing the assets in that region. It is currently valued at about \u00a31.98 billion and, according to Connolly, has achieved consistent performance, despite last year's poor showing on the equity markets. Over the past five years, the return on the fund has been 96.5 per cent. 'Even over the past 12 months, the fund has returned 8.2 per cent,' he says. 'The trust is never likely to produce spectacular returns, but will remain a solid performer,' says Connolly. 'It is ideal as a core holding, on which a novice investor can build a portfolio.' Anna Bowes, savings and investments manager at Chase de Vere Investments, chooses the Fidelity Special Values investment trust as her current favourite. This trust aims for above- average long-term capital growth by investing mainly in smaller and medium-sized UK companies in 'special situations'. These could be companies recovering from financially difficult periods, or stocks currently out of favour with investors. 'When we look for investment trusts for our clients, we want good, sturdy funds with good management,' says Bowes. 'We look at trusts that have shown good returns, even in turbulent times.' Anthony Bolton, who has an 'investment guru' reputation in the market, manages the trust, which is currently valued at about \u00a390 million. According to Bowes, the performance has been very good. 'It has achieved growth of 158 per cent over the past five years,' she says. 'It has outperformed its sector by 68 per cent.' Robert Graham, an associate partner at Scottish Financial Independence Group, likes the Scottish Mortgage investment trust, which is managed by Baillie Gifford. The trust aims to achieve maximum growth in capital value and dividends by investing internationally, mainly in listed securities. 'The trust has been very good at getting the assets where growth occurs,' says Graham. The fund, valued at about \u00a31.8 billion, is managed by James Anderson and currently trades at a discount of about 13.2 per cent. The yield is quoted at 1.4 per cent. Graham points out that, over the past five years, the trust has returned 77.4 per cent, although last year was a difficult one with a loss of about 6 per cent. However, because of the poor return in 2000, Graham believes there is growth potential for the future. 'I like a good fund that has had a poorish year,' he says.

      "body": "<p>'When it's two o'clock in the morning, and you're manic, even the UCLA Medical center has a certain appeal. The hospital - ordinarily a cold clotting of uninteresting buildings - became for me, that fall morning not quite 20 years ago, a focus of my finely wired, exquisitely alert nervous system. With vibrissae twinging, antennae perked, eyes fast-forwarding and fly faceted, I took in everything around me. I was on the run. Not just on the run but fast and furious on the run, darting back and forth across the hospital parking lot trying to use up a boundless, restless, manic energy. I was running fast, but slowly going mad.'</p> <p>Thus Kay Jamison, psychologist and manic depressive, described a psychotic episode in her brilliant book, An Unquiet Mind, subtitled 'A Memoir of Moods and Madness'. Combining the expertise of the professional with the insight of a patient, she confronted a disease that defies prediction and ruins lives. In the course of it, she told us more about mental illness than 20 articles in the British Journal of Psychiatry . 'Manic depression,' she wrote, 'is a disease that both kills and gives life. Fire, by its nature, both creates and destroys... mania is a strange and driving force, a destroyer, a fire in the blood.'</p> <p>You will not find language like this in the 10,000 words of earnest rhetoric that constitute the Government's new White Paper on Reforming the Mental Health Act in England and Wales. Nor indeed will you find any reference to 'madness'. It is the forbidden subject, a black hole around which we circle fearfully, ring-fencing it with decent phrases like mental illness, mental disorder, mental disability, mental incapacity, anything, in short, that saves us from the difficulty, the embarrassment or the pain of exploring the mind of someone who is losing theirs.</p> <p>Instead, the watchword is 'protection'. There has, say Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, and Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, been a tragic toll of homicides and suicides. The current laws have failed properly to protect the public; the lives of patients and staff have been put at risk. We must protect the mentally ill from themselves, and from the public; we must protect the public from the mentally ill. In Scotland, an even weightier document has been published - 500 pages reporting on a detailed review of the Mental Health Act as it applies to Scotland. No one can doubt that it is well-intentioned. Its stated principles include non-discrimination, equality and respect. It places patients, or as they are referred to these days, 'service users', at the centre of its proposals. It explores the need to change the way mental patients are compulsorily treated, and for the first time acknowledges the role of relatives and friends, the embattled front line of those who cope every day with the mentally ill.</p> <p>It will, however, take more than good intentions to reverse the 30 years of failure and neglect that have characterised this country's treatment of its mental patients, the scandal of its prematurely shut-down hospitals and its underfunded programme of care in the community. It will take courage to spend time in those wards, where the cigarette ends litter the floor and the smears of angry protest stain the walls; courage to talk to the damaged souls who inhabit them, and the wary staff whose job it is to monitor their restless progress. And courage to confront the reality that awaits the inmates when the drugs have run their course, and they are judged well enough to return to the unwelcoming world outside.</p> <p>The reality then is likely to be the schizophrenic boy who sits in his lonely flat, watching the TV which speaks to him in strange voices, or the anorexic girl who claws at her wrists as she waits for the hospital bed that is no longer available, or the family in despair as they see their manic-depressive son spiralling out of control, unable to take action until he commits a crime and the police move in.</p> <p>Kay Jamison's book ends with her finding the correct level of lithium to hold her life on course, recognising that she would always swing between the 'electrifying carnival of light' that marked her manic phases and the 'black, grey and tired heap' into which she plummeted when they came to an end. But Professor Jamison had privileges which most of today's mental patients in Britain conspicuously lack. She benefited from her own intelligence and insight; she had the expert care of well-qualified friends and fellow-professionals; her illness, though threatening, did not cripple her. Life on the NHS is very different.</p> <p>We spent much of last Christmas in the closed ward of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital where our son was consigned following the onset of a manic episode. He had been involved in a fracas with a pub bouncer who had called the police. Archie has never been violent, but he is tall and can be intimidating, so from time to time he has attracted the defensive aggression of others.</p> <p>He has suffered from manic depression, or bipolar affective disorder as it is medically termed, for more than 15 years, after succumbing to it first while he was still at school. MD is a relentless and unforgiving disease. It comes in cycles, but they are unpredictable. The manic phase means that all the processes of brain and body speed up to the point where life becomes like a Ferris wheel at speed, out of control, wildly exhilarating. Most normal constraints fall away, behaviour becomes loud and boisterous (the medical jargon calls it 'inappropriate'), money is spent like water, sleep is an optional extra. It is followed by a period of dark depression, when any action at all seems almost impossible.</p> <p>To anyone who has not experienced them, the first signs of manic depression can be frightening. Archie was 15 years old, in mid-school career, when it happened. He had always been a gregarious schoolboy, popular, outgoing, a brilliant actor who had starred in several school plays. One half-term, while preparing a written project, his work began to slow down and finally stop, to the point where he was physically incapable of pushing his pen across the paper. Unable to explain or communicate what was happening, he found himself in a mental limbo, while we looked on, incapable of helping. We took him to a psychiatrist who advised the school, and he prescribed anti-depressants. It seemed, on the surface, to be some kind of nervous breakdown, and by the following term Archie had recovered sufficiently to return. But he found himself unable to cope with school routine and finally it was decided he should come back home.</p> <p>What happened next was far worse. The depression he had been going through was succeeded by a period of intense, disturbing activity. His behaviour became loudly extravagant, his language crude and offensive. He would play music in his room at top volume. Then one night he disappeared. We lived in London at the time, and all we could do was alert the police and tell them about his state of mind.</p> <p>They found him next day at King's Cross station. He was angry and obstreperous, furious at being held in a police cell, insistent that he should be released.</p> <p>We called in the same psychiatrist, who said there was only one solution - Archie should be taken to a hospital in south London dealing with psychotic illnesses. I will never forget that drive. He had no idea where he was being taken and we had to conceal the reality from him. We felt helpless, as if, in the act of defending him, we were in fact committing an act of treachery. When we rounded the corner of the hospital drive and he saw where we were taking him he was outraged. He was dragged inside, literally kicking and screaming, though to the end he preserved his sense of humour. 'Where's the press?' he shouted. 'They should be here to see this.'</p> <p>This was our first experience of a closed ward, a place constructed to prevent its inmates doing harm to themselves or others. It was the first of many. Since that day, Archie has run the gamut of hospitals, from the privately-financed Priory hospitals to state-run institutions, north and south of the border. Both he and we have learnt much about the illness, the agony of confronting a person who rejects help contemptuously but needs it desperately, the despair when he is out of control, roaring down the street towards who knows what fate.</p> <p>We have known the phone calls, from him or the police, to tell of some escapade, the requests to come and collect him or to visit him in a cell or a hospital ward. And we have known the joy and relief when gradually, as it always does, the wheel returns him to something approaching normality. Through this time, we have seen every form of treatment, from ECT to cocktails of drugs, delivered in doses so powerful you cannot imagine he could survive them, yet absorbed into his system as if they were aspirin. It is a tribute to him and the strength of his character that he has emerged from this history of medical battering with his warmth, charm and independence intact. We are immensely proud of him.</p> <p>Two things have marked his long and, thus far, unfinished journey: the handful of doctors and nurses who stood by him through the worst of times, and whose dedication in awful circumstances is humbling. And the steady decline of the health service which should have supported him. His period of illness coincides with one of the most wretched chapters in the postwar history of the NHS. It has seen the closing down of some of Britain's largest mental hospitals - the asylums, or places of safety, of a previous era - and the heavy reduction of available beds. In their place was substituted care in the community.</p> <p>The idea was that the resources tied up in the buildings and their beds would be released to provide a support service for the mentally ill once they were returned to their families and their localities. But the funds were diverted elsewhere, and the back-up was wholly inadequate. Patients, many of them still on heavy medication, were discharged by hospitals which had no means of monitoring their progress. Families incapable of handling difficult and disruptive relatives were left to cope on their own. GPs found their lists swollen by cases requiring specialist advice which was overstretched and often unavailable. Meanwhile, as medication grew more sophisticated, the need for long-term psychiatric care was judged to be less important or even unnecessary. Investment in psychotherapy declined, the means of ensuring long-term support for patients once released into the community became stretched or non-existent.</p> <p>Addressing the annual meeting of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Belfast in 1998, the distinguished psychiatrist, Professor Hugh Freeman, concluded thus: 'I will say very little about the developments of the 1990s, except that I regard them as almost wholly disastrous.'</p> <p>In his lecture, he traced the history of mental health services in this country from the Victorian era, when those forbidding asylums which we now reject so contemptuously were built as places of safety. Looking back at that period, what is striking is the recognition by philanthropists that the mentally ill had been scandalously treated in the past, and that what they needed most was something to occupy their minds and bodies. Thus many of the hospitals built at the time had extensive gardens and the opportunity to learn a trade. Opening a new wing of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital in 1894, costing \u00a3160,000, an immense sum for those days, a Scots benefactor, Sir Thomas Clouston, said: 'Nothing we can do for the comfort of our patients is too much to atone for the cruelty of past ages.'</p> <p>It is hard to determine exactly when the subsequent decline began. Some would say there has always been a reluctance to allow psychiatry to operate under the same terms and conditions as other branches of medicine, and, of course, many of those old hospitals did become grim places as their physical condition deteriorated. Others say the erosion has been more recent, pointing out that Britain's standards of treatment were once the envy of the world, thanks to an influx of refugee specialists from Europe between the wars.</p> <p>Around the mid-1950s, with the development of more sophisticated drugs, the emphasis on hospital treatment was gradually replaced by a belief that the walls of the old institutions should be pulled down and the inmates released into the outside world. The famous 1959 Mental Health Act did not, as Professor Freeman points out, legislate for community care, but it did remove legal barriers to extramural treatment, and expressed general approval for a non-institutional approach. 'Owing to the opposition of the Treasury, however,' he says, 'local authorities were not given a positive duty to provide community mental health services and they did not receive a specific grant to do so.'</p> <p>It is a pattern that has been woefully repeated ever since. Even today, when the inadequacies of care in the community have been starkly exposed, the resources are still not there. Although grants to local authorities for community mental health care have finally been achieved, their role in the meantime has changed. They have become commissioning agents rather than providers of service. 'In the 1990s,' said Freeman, 'long-term care within the NHS virtually ceased, being largely transferred to private facilities, with social services handling the financial aspects. Yet there was virtually no public discussion of such a major change.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, spending on mental health services within the NHS actually fell in real terms by 5.4 per cent in the first half of the decade, despite being an acknowledged 'priority'. One fellow-psychiatrist described it as 'one of the best-kept secrets in the country'.</p> <p>Yet this is not a minority issue. The best estimate from the Office for National Statistics is that one in seven adults is affected at any one time by significant mental health problems. These can range from anxiety and depression to dementia and schizophrenia. Around 230 people out of 1,000 will visit their GP at some stage, of whom 102 will be diagnosed as suffering from some form of mental illness. Of these, 24 will be referred to a specialist psychiatric service and six will become in-patients in psychiatric hospitals. Not only are the figures growing, but the World Health Organisation has warned that deaths from mental health disorders will be the second most common cause of death and disability by 2020.</p> <p>I thought long and hard before writing about my son's experience in the Times following our visit last Christmas. We owe a huge debt to his doctor and his nursing staff at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, who have been involved with him for more than a decade, and who have always provided the best possible treatment in the form of medication and advice. That he has not benefited from long-term care is by no means their fault; he himself has usually rejected anything in the form of therapy, though he is visited by a community psychiatric nurse who administers a monthly injection.</p> <p>Above all, I did not want to prejudice my son's position or his future welfare. But I felt, as any parent would, a surge of anger at what I saw. Why should any patient, mental or otherwise, have to suffer these kinds of surroundings? Temporary they may be, but for a patient in the grip of a severe illness, that is small comfort. Moreover, the timing for such an article seemed to be important: both health departments north and south of the border were issuing lengthy reports on reforming the Mental Health Act of 1984. My article appeared just after Christmas. What I had not anticipated was the huge and passionate response from readers. They told stories of isolation and abandonment, of a failure to find help when it was needed most, of indifference, neglect and insensitivity.</p> <p>Watching the onset of the process that Kay Jamison calls 'running fast but slowly going mad' is agonising. Not for the sufferer, but for the onlooker. It is like seeing a car heading for certain collision. You know it is going to end in disaster but you cannot intervene. It begins with behaviour which is merely excitable - fast talking, loud conversation, impatience with the slow and boring pace of the rest of humanity. Grandiose plans must be made, meetings set up, rendezvous made and broken. As the attention span diminishes, so boredom must be banished. Routine medication becomes a tiresome interference with life lived on the edge. Tolerance disappears, to be replaced with irritation. Everyone must be sucked into a whirlpool of activity.</p> <p>It is at this stage that parents or relatives long to take action. If only they could persuade their son or daughter to check into hospital, something might be done. But this is the last thing on the mind of the manic depressive. The 'insight' that he may have acquired into his illness recedes. At the most, this 'florid' behaviour, as it is known, is dismissed as a 'blip'. The last thing he wants to contemplate is the empty routine of life on the ward. Doctors have no powers to intervene. You can alert the hospital and tip off the police, but if the patient is over 21, his or her rights are enshrined and protected.</p> <p>Almost inevitably, behaviour like this, late at night in a pub or on the street, attracts attention and leads to trouble. It can be challenging, aggressive, 'in your face'. At some stage, it may tumble over the edge, to the point where the police become involved. Oddly, the midnight call from the station sergeant comes as a relief. In almost all our dealings with the police, we have found them sensitive, understanding and co-operative. They will alert the hospital and deliver the patient into safe hands. In order to hold him, however, an application has to be made for him to be 'sectioned' under the Mental Health Act.</p> <p>The Act, framed in 1983, was drawn up largely to protect the civil rights of the mentally ill. Its powers of compulsion are, of course, highly controversial because it means the removal of someone's personal freedom. The very term 'to section' sounds vaguely sinister, almost as if it involves a surgical operation. In fact, it is a reference to the section of the Act which lays down precisely the terms under which the patient can be detained in hospital, and the carefully enshrined grounds for appeal which can be put to a court if he wishes to contest it. It is a lawyer's Act, not a psychiatrist's. Sectioning, which can remain in force for up to six months, has been attacked as a heavy-handed and intrusive instrument. But to the families who have to deal with the reality of mental illness, it is very often a lifeline. It represents the means by which, at last, the hospital is given powers to detain and the treatment can begin.</p> <p>The period that follows for patients suffering from bipolar disorders or other psychotic illnesses is likely to be lengthy, traumatic and hugely demanding. Medication, however effective, takes time to work. To begin with, you are dealing with a patient who is angry and bitterly resentful, who sees his surroundings as punishment, his hospital ward as a prison, and nursing staff as unreasonable warders. The target for his rage is likely to be the next visitor or the next doctor. Parents and relatives find themselves on the receiving end of these outbursts for they, after all, are the betrayers - they have connived with the authorities. The patient can see no reason for his continued incarceration. Everything seems to be conspiring against his release.</p> <p>The key to managing his condition at this stage is the proper combination, or 'cocktail', of anti-psychotic drugs, but sometimes even they may be ineffective, and ECT can be the only solution. That, too, has sinister overtones but, in extremis , it can be a lifesaver. As, too, is that most common of drugs, the cigarette. In the wards of mental hospitals, smoking is omnipresent and no one protests. Without tobacco, it would be hard to imagine some of those inmates, at the end of their tether, surviving at all. What they need, and all too often lack, is visitors, links with the outside world, a path they can recognise back to normality.</p> <p>One American psychiatrist working in Britain, with whom I have corresponded at length, points to the stark contrast between conditions here and in the US: 'I say this without intent to boast, but most NHS wards would be shut down in the US. The Justice Department has taken a particularly tough position with respect to hospitals which have detained patients and offer little active treatment and shoddy wards. By contrast there are a number of fine new units around the country. The acute service at Farnborough Hospital comes to mind. I believe over 400, possibly 450, consultant posts in psychiatry go unfilled. NHS consultants are stretched beyond tolerance and as a result often know their patients very little, making infrequent contacts, perhaps weekly for a few minutes. 'Care' is left to junior doctors, also stretched. Care in the community is not adequately available by any stretch of the imagination. Unconscionable compromises are made in discharging patients to the community. In London especially, aftercare is more a concept than a reality.</p> <p>Responses like this emphasise two recurring complaints: poor ward conditions where they are needed most and the low priority placed on long-term care, which must include families and friends, who are almost always the front line in dealing with mental illness. Both issues have at least been recognised in the two reports already referred to. Susan Deacon, the Scottish Health Minister, is on record as saying: 'Nowhere are more modern dignified surroundings more important in the NHS than where patients with mental health problems are concerned. Sadly, thanks to years of neglect, too many of our mental health facilities are simply not up to the job.' At Westminster, the Health Secretary, Alan Milburn, says: 'As far as hospital beds are concerned, it doesn't seem viable to go on reducing them in the way that has been happening in the last few decades.'</p> <p>At the same time, both reports recognise belatedly the role of outside carers and the need to build better contacts with them. Many GPs who deal with the mentally ill now use the services of counsellors, and there has been an expansion in what is known as 'assertive outreach teams', whose aim is to close the gap between hospital and the community, to provide the support and treatment that is needed long after the patient has been discharged.</p> <p>It has finally been recognised that the 'revolving door' scenario, whereby patients have to be regularly readmitted to hospital because they have gradually deteriorated once outside, is not only heartless, it is grossly inefficient and expensive. One can only hope that those who serve, either as counsellors or on outreach teams, are given proper training and the funding and back-up that has been so conspicuously lacking hitherto. There is still, however, a shortfall in the number of psychiatric consultants, and until this branch of medicine is properly recognised and rewarded, it is hard to see how that can be reversed.</p> <p>What is depressing is that the current discussions, both north and south of the border, place far more emphasis on the issue of 'compulsion' - the use of legal powers to commit patients to hospital against their will - than to the underlying causes that lead to a crisis in the first place. A handful of cases in which mentally ill people have attacked and sometimes murdered members of the public has dominated headlines and the minds of Ministers to the point where this is seen as the most urgent problem to be addressed. Not only are the statistics negligible,but the solution is far more complex and expensive than the easy option of simply locking up more patients.</p> <p>One can read page after page of well-intentioned prose in both the Scottish and the English reports without encountering that flash of compassion and commitment which goes beyond the precise requirements of the law and announces forthrightly: 'What we see here is a scandal. It has been hidden for too long. We are determined to end it.'</p> <p>Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of Sane, the mental health charity, talks of the need to replace 'the lost concept of asylum' and ensure that the beds, the supported places and the skilled staff are there to provide the rigorous risk assessment and care needed. 'The Government,' she says, 'must look beyond the law and guarantee the funding to provide the \"safe, sound and supportive\" system it promised.'</p> <p>There is a terrible familiarity about those sentiments. It is now 15 years since the Times devoted the whole of its leader column to a memorable indictment of Britain's mental health service. Its final paragraph ran: 'It ought not to be beyond the capabilities of British society to recognise the different needs of those who need to make only the one return trip through the revolving door, those who make many return trips, and those for whom the journey is one way for ever. Without such a determined recognition, today's tragedy of mental illness will become tomorrow's public scandal.'</p> <p>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that 'tomorrow' has arrived. The remedy, if it is out there, will only come if we are determined enough to confront the reality of mental suffering, to deal with it head-on rather than treat it as an unpleasant inconvenience from which society has to be insulated.</p> <p>That there has been a recognition of the failure of past decades has, it seems, been accepted. The words, the good intentions, the worthy investigation of systems and procedures, have been delivered. The time has come for action to redress the shameful legacy of past neglect. Britain cannot claim to be a civilised society so long as it turns its back on those who are going slowly mad.</p> <p>For those in need of immediate help or advice on mental illness, call the SANELINE on 0845 767 8000, open 12 noon to 2am</p> <p>Magnus Linklater has been chairman of the Scottish Arts Council since 1996.

Not just on the run but fast and furious on the run, darting back and forth across the hospital parking lot trying to use up a boundless, restless, manic energy. I was running fast, but slowly going mad.' Thus Kay Jamison, psychologist and manic depressive, described a psychotic episode in her brilliant book, An Unquiet Mind, subtitled 'A Memoir of Moods and Madness'. Combining the expertise of the professional with the insight of a patient, she confronted a disease that defies prediction and ruins lives. In the course of it, she told us more about mental illness than 20 articles in the British Journal of Psychiatry . 'Manic depression,' she wrote, 'is a disease that both kills and gives life. Fire, by its nature, both creates and destroys... mania is a strange and driving force, a destroyer, a fire in the blood.' You will not find language like this in the 10,000 words of earnest rhetoric that constitute the Government's new White Paper on Reforming the Mental Health Act in England and Wales. Nor indeed will you find any reference to 'madness'. It is the forbidden subject, a black hole around which we circle fearfully, ring-fencing it with decent phrases like mental illness, mental disorder, mental disability, mental incapacity, anything, in short, that saves us from the difficulty, the embarrassment or the pain of exploring the mind of someone who is losing theirs. Instead, the watchword is 'protection'. There has, say Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, and Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, been a tragic toll of homicides and suicides. The current laws have failed properly to protect the public; the lives of patients and staff have been put at risk. We must protect the mentally ill from themselves, and from the public; we must protect the public from the mentally ill. In Scotland, an even weightier document has been published - 500 pages reporting on a detailed review of the Mental Health Act as it applies to Scotland. No one can doubt that it is well-intentioned. Its stated principles include non-discrimination, equality and respect. It places patients, or as they are referred to these days, 'service users', at the centre of its proposals. It explores the need to change the way mental patients are compulsorily treated, and for the first time acknowledges the role of relatives and friends, the embattled front line of those who cope every day with the mentally ill. It will, however, take more than good intentions to reverse the 30 years of failure and neglect that have characterised this country's treatment of its mental patients, the scandal of its prematurely shut-down hospitals and its underfunded programme of care in the community. It will take courage to spend time in those wards, where the cigarette ends litter the floor and the smears of angry protest stain the walls; courage to talk to the damaged souls who inhabit them, and the wary staff whose job it is to monitor their restless progress. And courage to confront the reality that awaits the inmates when the drugs have run their course, and they are judged well enough to return to the unwelcoming world outside. The reality then is likely to be the schizophrenic boy who sits in his lonely flat, watching the TV which speaks to him in strange voices, or the anorexic girl who claws at her wrists as she waits for the hospital bed that is no longer available, or the family in despair as they see their manic-depressive son spiralling out of control, unable to take action until he commits a crime and the police move in. Kay Jamison's book ends with her finding the correct level of lithium to hold her life on course, recognising that she would always swing between the 'electrifying carnival of light' that marked her manic phases and the 'black, grey and tired heap' into which she plummeted when they came to an end. But Professor Jamison had privileges which most of today's mental patients in Britain conspicuously lack. She benefited from her own intelligence and insight; she had the expert care of well-qualified friends and fellow-professionals; her illness, though threatening, did not cripple her. Life on the NHS is very different. We spent much of last Christmas in the closed ward of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital where our son was consigned following the onset of a manic episode. He had been involved in a fracas with a pub bouncer who had called the police. Archie has never been violent, but he is tall and can be intimidating, so from time to time he has attracted the defensive aggression of others. He has suffered from manic depression, or bipolar affective disorder as it is medically termed, for more than 15 years, after succumbing to it first while he was still at school. MD is a relentless and unforgiving disease. It comes in cycles, but they are unpredictable. The manic phase means that all the processes of brain and body speed up to the point where life becomes like a Ferris wheel at speed, out of control, wildly exhilarating. Most normal constraints fall away, behaviour becomes loud and boisterous (the medical jargon calls it 'inappropriate'), money is spent like water, sleep is an optional extra. It is followed by a period of dark depression, when any action at all seems almost impossible. To anyone who has not experienced them, the first signs of manic depression can be frightening. Archie was 15 years old, in mid-school career, when it happened. He had always been a gregarious schoolboy, popular, outgoing, a brilliant actor who had starred in several school plays. One half-term, while preparing a written project, his work began to slow down and finally stop, to the point where he was physically incapable of pushing his pen across the paper. Unable to explain or communicate what was happening, he found himself in a mental limbo, while we looked on, incapable of helping. We took him to a psychiatrist who advised the school, and he prescribed anti-depressants. It seemed, on the surface, to be some kind of nervous breakdown, and by the following term Archie had recovered sufficiently to return. But he found himself unable to cope with school routine and finally it was decided he should come back home. What happened next was far worse. The depression he had been going through was succeeded by a period of intense, disturbing activity. His behaviour became loudly extravagant, his language crude and offensive. He would play music in his room at top volume. Then one night he disappeared. We lived in London at the time, and all we could do was alert the police and tell them about his state of mind. They found him next day at King's Cross station. He was angry and obstreperous, furious at being held in a police cell, insistent that he should be released. We called in the same psychiatrist, who said there was only one solution - Archie should be taken to a hospital in south London dealing with psychotic illnesses. I will never forget that drive. He had no idea where he was being taken and we had to conceal the reality from him. We felt helpless, as if, in the act of defending him, we were in fact committing an act of treachery. When we rounded the corner of the hospital drive and he saw where we were taking him he was outraged. He was dragged inside, literally kicking and screaming, though to the end he preserved his sense of humour. 'Where's the press?' he shouted. 'They should be here to see this.' This was our first experience of a closed ward, a place constructed to prevent its inmates doing harm to themselves or others. It was the first of many. Since that day, Archie has run the gamut of hospitals, from the privately-financed Priory hospitals to state-run institutions, north and south of the border. Both he and we have learnt much about the illness, the agony of confronting a person who rejects help contemptuously but needs it desperately, the despair when he is out of control, roaring down the street towards who knows what fate. We have known the phone calls, from him or the police, to tell of some escapade, the requests to come and collect him or to visit him in a cell or a hospital ward. And we have known the joy and relief when gradually, as it always does, the wheel returns him to something approaching normality. Through this time, we have seen every form of treatment, from ECT to cocktails of drugs, delivered in doses so powerful you cannot imagine he could survive them, yet absorbed into his system as if they were aspirin. It is a tribute to him and the strength of his character that he has emerged from this history of medical battering with his warmth, charm and independence intact. We are immensely proud of him. Two things have marked his long and, thus far, unfinished journey: the handful of doctors and nurses who stood by him through the worst of times, and whose dedication in awful circumstances is humbling. And the steady decline of the health service which should have supported him. His period of illness coincides with one of the most wretched chapters in the postwar history of the NHS. It has seen the closing down of some of Britain's largest mental hospitals - the asylums, or places of safety, of a previous era - and the heavy reduction of available beds. In their place was substituted care in the community. The idea was that the resources tied up in the buildings and their beds would be released to provide a support service for the mentally ill once they were returned to their families and their localities. But the funds were diverted elsewhere, and the back-up was wholly inadequate. Patients, many of them still on heavy medication, were discharged by hospitals which had no means of monitoring their progress. Families incapable of handling difficult and disruptive relatives were left to cope on their own. GPs found their lists swollen by cases requiring specialist advice which was overstretched and often unavailable. Meanwhile, as medication grew more sophisticated, the need for long-term psychiatric care was judged to be less important or even unnecessary. Investment in psychotherapy declined, the means of ensuring long-term support for patients once released into the community became stretched or non-existent. Addressing the annual meeting of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Belfast in 1998, the distinguished psychiatrist, Professor Hugh Freeman, concluded thus: 'I will say very little about the developments of the 1990s, except that I regard them as almost wholly disastrous.' In his lecture, he traced the history of mental health services in this country from the Victorian era, when those forbidding asylums which we now reject so contemptuously were built as places of safety. Looking back at that period, what is striking is the recognition by philanthropists that the mentally ill had been scandalously treated in the past, and that what they needed most was something to occupy their minds and bodies. Thus many of the hospitals built at the time had extensive gardens and the opportunity to learn a trade. Opening a new wing of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital in 1894, costing \u00a3160,000, an immense sum for those days, a Scots benefactor, Sir Thomas Clouston, said: 'Nothing we can do for the comfort of our patients is too much to atone for the cruelty of past ages.' It is hard to determine exactly when the subsequent decline began. Some would say there has always been a reluctance to allow psychiatry to operate under the same terms and conditions as other branches of medicine, and, of course, many of those old hospitals did become grim places as their physical condition deteriorated. Others say the erosion has been more recent, pointing out that Britain's standards of treatment were once the envy of the world, thanks to an influx of refugee specialists from Europe between the wars. Around the mid-1950s, with the development of more sophisticated drugs, the emphasis on hospital treatment was gradually replaced by a belief that the walls of the old institutions should be pulled down and the inmates released into the outside world. The famous 1959 Mental Health Act did not, as Professor Freeman points out, legislate for community care, but it did remove legal barriers to extramural treatment, and expressed general approval for a non-institutional approach. 'Owing to the opposition of the Treasury, however,' he says, 'local authorities were not given a positive duty to provide community mental health services and they did not receive a specific grant to do so.' It is a pattern that has been woefully repeated ever since. Even today, when the inadequacies of care in the community have been starkly exposed, the resources are still not there. Although grants to local authorities for community mental health care have finally been achieved, their role in the meantime has changed. They have become commissioning agents rather than providers of service. 'In the 1990s,' said Freeman, 'long-term care within the NHS virtually ceased, being largely transferred to private facilities, with social services handling the financial aspects. Yet there was virtually no public discussion of such a major change.' Meanwhile, spending on mental health services within the NHS actually fell in real terms by 5.4 per cent in the first half of the decade, despite being an acknowledged 'priority'. One fellow-psychiatrist described it as 'one of the best-kept secrets in the country'. Yet this is not a minority issue. The best estimate from the Office for National Statistics is that one in seven adults is affected at any one time by significant mental health problems. These can range from anxiety and depression to dementia and schizophrenia. Around 230 people out of 1,000 will visit their GP at some stage, of whom 102 will be diagnosed as suffering from some form of mental illness. Of these, 24 will be referred to a specialist psychiatric service and six will become in-patients in psychiatric hospitals. Not only are the figures growing, but the World Health Organisation has warned that deaths from mental health disorders will be the second most common cause of death and disability by 2020. I thought long and hard before writing about my son's experience in the Times following our visit last Christmas. We owe a huge debt to his doctor and his nursing staff at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, who have been involved with him for more than a decade, and who have always provided the best possible treatment in the form of medication and advice. That he has not benefited from long-term care is by no means their fault; he himself has usually rejected anything in the form of therapy, though he is visited by a community psychiatric nurse who administers a monthly injection. Above all, I did not want to prejudice my son's position or his future welfare. But I felt, as any parent would, a surge of anger at what I saw. Why should any patient, mental or otherwise, have to suffer these kinds of surroundings? Temporary they may be, but for a patient in the grip of a severe illness, that is small comfort. Moreover, the timing for such an article seemed to be important: both health departments north and south of the border were issuing lengthy reports on reforming the Mental Health Act of 1984. My article appeared just after Christmas. What I had not anticipated was the huge and passionate response from readers. They told stories of isolation and abandonment, of a failure to find help when it was needed most, of indifference, neglect and insensitivity. Watching the onset of the process that Kay Jamison calls 'running fast but slowly going mad' is agonising. Not for the sufferer, but for the onlooker. It is like seeing a car heading for certain collision. You know it is going to end in disaster but you cannot intervene. It begins with behaviour which is merely excitable - fast talking, loud conversation, impatience with the slow and boring pace of the rest of humanity. Grandiose plans must be made, meetings set up, rendezvous made and broken. As the attention span diminishes, so boredom must be banished. Routine medication becomes a tiresome interference with life lived on the edge. Tolerance disappears, to be replaced with irritation. Everyone must be sucked into a whirlpool of activity. It is at this stage that parents or relatives long to take action. If only they could persuade their son or daughter to check into hospital, something might be done. But this is the last thing on the mind of the manic depressive. The 'insight' that he may have acquired into his illness recedes. At the most, this 'florid' behaviour, as it is known, is dismissed as a 'blip'. The last thing he wants to contemplate is the empty routine of life on the ward. Doctors have no powers to intervene. You can alert the hospital and tip off the police, but if the patient is over 21, his or her rights are enshrined and protected. Almost inevitably, behaviour like this, late at night in a pub or on the street, attracts attention and leads to trouble. It can be challenging, aggressive, 'in your face'. At some stage, it may tumble over the edge, to the point where the police become involved. Oddly, the midnight call from the station sergeant comes as a relief. In almost all our dealings with the police, we have found them sensitive, understanding and co-operative. They will alert the hospital and deliver the patient into safe hands. In order to hold him, however, an application has to be made for him to be 'sectioned' under the Mental Health Act. The Act, framed in 1983, was drawn up largely to protect the civil rights of the mentally ill. Its powers of compulsion are, of course, highly controversial because it means the removal of someone's personal freedom. The very term 'to section' sounds vaguely sinister, almost as if it involves a surgical operation. In fact, it is a reference to the section of the Act which lays down precisely the terms under which the patient can be detained in hospital, and the carefully enshrined grounds for appeal which can be put to a court if he wishes to contest it. It is a lawyer's Act, not a psychiatrist's. Sectioning, which can remain in force for up to six months, has been attacked as a heavy-handed and intrusive instrument. But to the families who have to deal with the reality of mental illness, it is very often a lifeline. It represents the means by which, at last, the hospital is given powers to detain and the treatment can begin. The period that follows for patients suffering from bipolar disorders or other psychotic illnesses is likely to be lengthy, traumatic and hugely demanding. Medication, however effective, takes time to work. To begin with, you are dealing with a patient who is angry and bitterly resentful, who sees his surroundings as punishment, his hospital ward as a prison, and nursing staff as unreasonable warders. The target for his rage is likely to be the next visitor or the next doctor. Parents and relatives find themselves on the receiving end of these outbursts for they, after all, are the betrayers - they have connived with the authorities. The patient can see no reason for his continued incarceration. Everything seems to be conspiring against his release. The key to managing his condition at this stage is the proper combination, or 'cocktail', of anti-psychotic drugs, but sometimes even they may be ineffective, and ECT can be the only solution. That, too, has sinister overtones but, in extremis , it can be a lifesaver. As, too, is that most common of drugs, the cigarette. In the wards of mental hospitals, smoking is omnipresent and no one protests. Without tobacco, it would be hard to imagine some of those inmates, at the end of their tether, surviving at all. What they need, and all too often lack, is visitors, links with the outside world, a path they can recognise back to normality. One American psychiatrist working in Britain, with whom I have corresponded at length, points to the stark contrast between conditions here and in the US: 'I say this without intent to boast, but most NHS wards would be shut down in the US. The Justice Department has taken a particularly tough position with respect to hospitals which have detained patients and offer little active treatment and shoddy wards. By contrast there are a number of fine new units around the country. The acute service at Farnborough Hospital comes to mind. I believe over 400, possibly 450, consultant posts in psychiatry go unfilled. NHS consultants are stretched beyond tolerance and as a result often know their patients very little, making infrequent contacts, perhaps weekly for a few minutes. 'Care' is left to junior doctors, also stretched. Care in the community is not adequately available by any stretch of the imagination. Unconscionable compromises are made in discharging patients to the community. In London especially, aftercare is more a concept than a reality. Responses like this emphasise two recurring complaints: poor ward conditions where they are needed most and the low priority placed on long-term care, which must include families and friends, who are almost always the front line in dealing with mental illness. Both issues have at least been recognised in the two reports already referred to. Susan Deacon, the Scottish Health Minister, is on record as saying: 'Nowhere are more modern dignified surroundings more important in the NHS than where patients with mental health problems are concerned. Sadly, thanks to years of neglect, too many of our mental health facilities are simply not up to the job.' At Westminster, the Health Secretary, Alan Milburn, says: 'As far as hospital beds are concerned, it doesn't seem viable to go on reducing them in the way that has been happening in the last few decades.' At the same time, both reports recognise belatedly the role of outside carers and the need to build better contacts with them. Many GPs who deal with the mentally ill now use the services of counsellors, and there has been an expansion in what is known as 'assertive outreach teams', whose aim is to close the gap between hospital and the community, to provide the support and treatment that is needed long after the patient has been discharged. It has finally been recognised that the 'revolving door' scenario, whereby patients have to be regularly readmitted to hospital because they have gradually deteriorated once outside, is not only heartless, it is grossly inefficient and expensive. One can only hope that those who serve, either as counsellors or on outreach teams, are given proper training and the funding and back-up that has been so conspicuously lacking hitherto. There is still, however, a shortfall in the number of psychiatric consultants, and until this branch of medicine is properly recognised and rewarded, it is hard to see how that can be reversed. What is depressing is that the current discussions, both north and south of the border, place far more emphasis on the issue of 'compulsion' - the use of legal powers to commit patients to hospital against their will - than to the underlying causes that lead to a crisis in the first place. A handful of cases in which mentally ill people have attacked and sometimes murdered members of the public has dominated headlines and the minds of Ministers to the point where this is seen as the most urgent problem to be addressed. Not only are the statistics negligible,but the solution is far more complex and expensive than the easy option of simply locking up more patients. One can read page after page of well-intentioned prose in both the Scottish and the English reports without encountering that flash of compassion and commitment which goes beyond the precise requirements of the law and announces forthrightly: 'What we see here is a scandal. It has been hidden for too long. We are determined to end it.' Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of Sane, the mental health charity, talks of the need to replace 'the lost concept of asylum' and ensure that the beds, the supported places and the skilled staff are there to provide the rigorous risk assessment and care needed. 'The Government,' she says, 'must look beyond the law and guarantee the funding to provide the \"safe, sound and supportive\" system it promised.' There is a terrible familiarity about those sentiments. It is now 15 years since the Times devoted the whole of its leader column to a memorable indictment of Britain's mental health service. Its final paragraph ran: 'It ought not to be beyond the capabilities of British society to recognise the different needs of those who need to make only the one return trip through the revolving door, those who make many return trips, and those for whom the journey is one way for ever. Without such a determined recognition, today's tragedy of mental illness will become tomorrow's public scandal.' It is hard to avoid the conclusion that 'tomorrow' has arrived. The remedy, if it is out there, will only come if we are determined enough to confront the reality of mental suffering, to deal with it head-on rather than treat it as an unpleasant inconvenience from which society has to be insulated. That there has been a recognition of the failure of past decades has, it seems, been accepted. The words, the good intentions, the worthy investigation of systems and procedures, have been delivered. The time has come for action to redress the shameful legacy of past neglect. Britain cannot claim to be a civilised society so long as it turns its back on those who are going slowly mad.

He is a former editor of the Scotsman and is presently a columnist for the Times and Scotland on Sunday A version of this article appears in the current issue of Prospect Mental Illness: The Facts \u0095 One in six adults has a mental health problem. One in 250 has a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia or manic depression. \u0095 Half of all women and one quarter of all men will be affected by depression at some time in their lives. \u0095 Only 40 per cent of women with neurotic disorders have seen their GP in the past 12 months, and just 27 per cent of men. \u0095 Ten per cent of schizophrenics and 15 per cent of those with affective and personality disorders commit suicide. \u0095 During the 1980s, the Conservative Government's policy of replacing hospital care with care in the community resulted in half of all hospital in-patient beds being closed. The number of long-stay residents was halved in five years. \u0095 In 1991, more than \u00a32 billion was saved through care in the community. Only a small proportion of this filtered through to community health services which received budget increases of just 20 per cent. \u0095 The proportion of NHS expenditure on mental illness went down from 15 per cent in 1958 to 10 per cent in 1993.

First, because fixed-interest securities always do well in a falling interest rate scenario. Second, because the prices of zeros have remained static for the past 18 months, so gross redemption yields have gone up and up.</p> <p>'You can now get zeros with a five-to-seven year life, paying up to 9 per cent per annum with tremendous risk comfort,' says Whitbread. 'Hurdle rates are very negative; around -10 per cent (meaning assets could fall by 10 per cent each year and there would still be sufficient to repay the holders), so there is bags of security. With interest rates falling, a fixed 8 per cent for, say, the next five years will look very good value in a year or so.'</p> <p>Whitbread recommends that investors look for a combination of strong yield and defensive hurdle rate. On this basis she picks out the Framlington Second Dual, Henderson High Income and St Davids zero trusts. The Framlington fund has a redemption date in August 2005 and currently yields 8.5 per cent, with a hurdle rate of -2. For more cautious investors, the Henderson trust, which redeems in September 2005, has a 7.3 per cent yield and a hurdle rate of -19. The St Davids fund has a longer life, redeeming in 2007, but currently yields 8.7 per cent with a hurdle rate of -11. Anna Bowes of Chase de Vere favours the unit trust, diversified, approach. 'This is a specialised area, so we like to have a spread of funds where you don't have to worry about redemption dates,' she says. She selects the Exeter Zero Preference fund, yielding 7.4 per cent with a hurdle rate of -13 and the Aberdeen Progressive Growth fund yielding 8.3 per cent with a hurdle rate of -4.</p>",

Often nowadays, the hurdle rate will be a negative figure, indicating that assets could actually shrink each year and still be sufficient. For investors looking for wider diversification, a number of unit and investment trusts investing in a range of zeros are now available. Investors may have to pay for this diversification however - unit trust charges tend to be around 5 per cent initial and 1 per cent annual; charges for buying an investment trust direct or via a stockbroker are much lower. Sue Whitbread, investment trust expert at IFA Chartwell, says zeros are particularly attractive at the moment for two reasons. First, because fixed-interest securities always do well in a falling interest rate scenario. Second, because the prices of zeros have remained static for the past 18 months, so gross redemption yields have gone up and up. 'You can now get zeros with a five-to-seven year life, paying up to 9 per cent per annum with tremendous risk comfort,' says Whitbread. 'Hurdle rates are very negative; around -10 per cent (meaning assets could fall by 10 per cent each year and there would still be sufficient to repay the holders), so there is bags of security. With interest rates falling, a fixed 8 per cent for, say, the next five years will look very good value in a year or so.' Whitbread recommends that investors look for a combination of strong yield and defensive hurdle rate. On this basis she picks out the Framlington Second Dual, Henderson High Income and St Davids zero trusts. The Framlington fund has a redemption date in August 2005 and currently yields 8.5 per cent, with a hurdle rate of -2. For more cautious investors, the Henderson trust, which redeems in September 2005, has a 7.3 per cent yield and a hurdle rate of -19. The St Davids fund has a longer life, redeeming in 2007, but currently yields 8.7 per cent with a hurdle rate of -11. Anna Bowes of Chase de Vere favours the unit trust, diversified, approach. 'This is a specialised area, so we like to have a spread of funds where you don't have to worry about redemption dates,' she says. She selects the Exeter Zero Preference fund, yielding 7.4 per cent with a hurdle rate of -13 and the Aberdeen Progressive Growth fund yielding 8.3 per cent with a hurdle rate of -4.",

Croft, though far more reliable than his predecessor, Ian Salisbury, seldom threatened, while Giles could not emulate his stirring efforts in Pakistan. There was no rhythm, no spring. Maybe he was wary of his dodgy Achilles. In the end he had to retreat to bowling over the wicket and outside leg-stump. It was ugly stuff - except when Mahela Jayawardena enterprisingly decided to reverse-slog him. Several deliveries should have been called a wide but the novice umpire PT Manuel was lenient and eager not to cause offence. </p> <p>It was of course a different matter when Murali set to work even though the little magician may not be 100 per cent fit.

Not only is it vital to press on after making a century, it's also without question the easiest time you will ever get to bat: the ball is as big as melon, the bowlers are tired and the pressure of making a respectable score is long gone. The best Test batsmen know never to miss out on a chance to fill their boots because there will always be occasions where you receive a good ball early on and can't do anything about it. </p> <p>Well as he played last summer and in Pakistan before Christmas, Trescothick wouldn't have been happy to get out after doing the hard work, as he did in the Lahore Test, for example, in sight of a century. Watching him bat yesterday it is clear he has learned from those experiences and has mentally cleared an important hurdle in turning an acceptable score into a significant one, which isn't as easy as it might seem. Look at the number of times Graham Thorpe was out between 50 and 100 during his early Test career. It even led to the Surrey man being dropped from the England team when his average suggested otherwise. </p> <p>The fact that Trescothick knuckled down through a tricky spell yesterday afternoon and accepted responsibility after seeing the key figures of Michael Atherton and Thorpe out in quick succession can only bode well for the future. </p> <p>I got a chance to spend time with Marcus with England A in New Zealand last winter and while he was initially very quiet, he opened up as the tour went on and was very funny.

Broad did that for me when I was captain, and England now look as though they have found another opener capable of performing the role.

      "body": "<p>England's least experienced batsman played the most mature innings. Marcus Trescothick, supremely composed in the stifling Sri Lankan heat, batted all day to sustain English hopes of saving this Test match. Eighty minutes before the close he registered his maiden Test century and only the eighth of his first-class career. He admitted that in the Nineties: 'I was nervous - but I wasn't affected by nerves.' He clipped Muttiah Muralitharan to the mid-wicket boundary to reach 99 and then in his own self-effacing way he explained: 'there was a leading edge to the wrong side of the field [to cover] but I'll take that any time.' </p> <p>Trescothick has now been on the field for three days in soaring temperatures and he acknowledged that his level of fitness has pleased him as much as anything else. There was a time when Trescothick was a podgy prodigy - he was actually omitted from the West under-15s tour of the Caribbean because he was deemed to be not fit enough to go. Now he has the sleekness and the stamina of an international sportsman and this advance alone hints at the efforts that Trescothick has made to develop his game in every department. </p> <p>Trescothick has always possessed an abundance of talent as his teenage record confirms, but it was in danger of being squandered until England had the foresight to pick him last summer. Now we are starting to take for granted that he will be a fixture in the national side for years to come and that this should be the first of many centuries. Yet no one, even at Somerset, could have predicted that his elevation would have coincided with the revelation of such mental toughness allied to a precise analysis of his own game. In his youth, raw talent had been enough. He knows better now. He has a sharp cricketing brain and he's using it. </p> <p>The signs were there before his first Test last summer. Before going to Old Trafford he was at Taunton having a private net, during which he practised, for 15 minutes, nothing but leaving the ball. He had realised that this would be a vital part of his batting armoury against Walsh and Ambrose. Between the winter tours he was back at Taunton working out how he would combat Sri Lankan off-spinners. Murali was on his mind way before Trescothick arrived in Colombo. This harnessing of talent to clear-headed preparation now leaves England with a substantial player. </p> <p>Trescothick alone was comfortable on an increasingly dusty and untrustworthy pitch in Galle and his duel with Murali was the constant and engrossing feature of the day. Murali beat his outside edge several times but Trescothick was all phlegm. Batting almost on off stump he tried nothing extravagant against him. He eschewed the sweep shot, even though this is a Trescothick trademark against 'normal' spinners. He waited to use the cut shot; otherwise he pushed gently forward in defence. Initially the drive was deemed out of bounds especially after he almost presented a return catch to the off-spinner on 27. Midway through the afternoon he permitted himself the odd pushed drive against Murali to keep the scoreboard creeping round. </p> <p>Murali, supposedly weaker against left-handers, yielded nothing even though he is obviously not 100 per cent fit (this did not stop him bowling 37 overs in the day). Increasingly the conclusion had to be drawn that Murali was being thwarted not by Trescothick's left-handedness but by his immaculate concentration and sure touch. </p> <p>Trescothick was freer against the other Sri Lankans. Chaminda Vaas did manage to find his outside edge a couple of times and was disdainfully pulled on the rare occasions he dropped short. Kumar Dharmesena, unimpressive throughout, was regularly cut and once was dragged to the mid-wicket boundary from outside off stump. Sanath Jayasuriya's left-arm spinners were more effective against the other English batsmen, but not Trescothick as he advanced towards his hundred. </p> <p>When he reached it he jigged with delight before acknowledging applause from all around the ground, making sure that he spotted the loyal contingent from Keynsham, his club back home. There were no fancy embraces from his partner, of course. Alec Stewart delivered a no-nonsense handshake and instructions to keep going, which were obeyed. </p> <p>Trescothick had seemed more assured than Mike Atherton in the morning partly because the old boy was scratchier than normal during a slow, wicketless first session. On 19 Atherton might have been lbw to Vaas, who managed to swing the odd ball; he was also dropped at silly point by Mahela Jayawardena off Murali on 28 and was caught by the same bowler on 30 but the ball had ricocheted off the short leg fieldsman's helmet so no one was too animated except poor Dilshan who had received the blow. In this Lancastrian duel, familiarity does not breed contempt. Murali's brief sojourn at Old Trafford has only raised Atherton's estimation of the one-off off-spinner. </p> <p>The lunch break seemed to disrupt Atherton's famed powers of concentration. He was almost lbw to the first ball he received from Vaas in the afternoon session. After the second he bizarrely sent for some fresh gloves. To the third he was lbw as he pushed half forward - the better of two lbw decisions given by umpire Manuel (the next one would be a shocker). </p> <p>Nasser Hussain, at the other end, was lbw after 25 tentative minutes against Murali. He loitered a second but the replays suggested he was in line with the stumps. He hadn't been betrayed as he was - twice - in Faisalabad. Graham Thorpe lasted a little longer without settling and was snapped up in the gully off Murali. Then Stewart hung on for two hours and 20 minutes, scoring just 19 in an 80-run partnership. He was never fluent, but he was mighty unfortunate when given lbw to Jayasuriya bowling over the wicket. The ball had pitched at least six inches outside his leg-stump - a decision that was another reinforcement for Duncan Fletcher's referral system. </p> <p>Trescothick admitted that Stewart's dismissal - curiously - was a help to him. 'With about half an hour to go I was starting to feel tired and my concentration was starting to waver,' he said afterwards. 'Alec's dismissal woke me up; the pressure was back on and I knew I had to stay there.' Which he did with the dutiful Robert Croft, who rejected the single that would have got him off the mark in order to protect his partner. It was a selfless gesture, but no more than Trescothick deserved.</p>",

Throughout, cricket has been seen by some as a unifying force. Muttiah Muralitharan, as a Tamil in a majority Sinhalese team is seen as the embodiment of this spirit and a bridge between the ethnic divide. </p> <p>The World Cup victory of 1996 was of course a defining moment for Sri Lankan cricket and society and people hoped that it would have a positive effect. An Indian magazine, Outlook, quoted a high-ranking Tamil Tigers figure after the World Cup as saying: 'Ranatunga is my favourite cricketer,' which would have been unheard of before the victory. </p> <p>Sri Lanka is a diverse country of different races and religion including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. Cricket in Sri Lanka developed along these racial lines when clubs began to be formed in the late nineteenth century. Cricket clubs offer a mirror image of Sri Lankan society in its racial mix. The names of the clubs that today play in Sri Lanka's Premier Domestic competitions bear witness to this. The Sinhalese Sports Club, The Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club, The Moors Sports Club (for Muslims) and the Burgher Recreation Club (descendants of the Portuguese and Dutch settlers) are examples. </p> <p>One club, the wonderfully named Nondescripts Cricket Club, obviously eschewed racial and religious criteria and today has Aravinda de Silva, Sangakkara the wicket keeper and Russel Arnold among its players. </p> <p>In the pavilions of these clubs you can get an idea of their respective origins. Hussains, Suleimans, Latifs and Razzaks are some of the names that you can see on the lists of past players and captains at the Moors Club. In the old pavilion of the Nondescripts Cricket Club, with its large fans and well-stocked bar, the names of those that have represented Ceylon or Sri Lanka from the club are proudly displayed. </p> <p>These are not just cricket clubs. They are real sports clubs with rugby, hockey, athletics, squash, tennis and swimming. They are very social places where the bar is open in the evening. </p> <p>'Today these clubs are open to all,' as one member of the Tamil Club told me. 'We have had Sinhalese players and presidents for many years. There is no discrimination in Sri Lankan cricket.' The London office of Tamil supporters does not believe this is the case. They talk of the Sri Lankan cricket establishment as one of the best examples of 'Sinhala racism'. </p> <p>A spokesman said: 'Muralitharan is not a good role model - he has been corrupted by the Sinhalese.' The spokesman also said there was very little cricket in the north due to an acute lack of facilities and equipment and a need to concentrate on 'more important things'. </p> <p>It is not Tamil policy to support the Sri Lankan national side. On the 1998 Sri Lankan tour of England they called for a boycott and also 'to cheer and support the English cricket team'. In the 1999 World Cup when Sri Lanka played South Africa, a light aircraft buzzed the ground displaying banners reading 'killing Tamils is not cricket' and 'South Africa - we support you'. </p> <p>I don't know how the Tamil community in Britain reacted to these calls, but I have generally found the people of Sri Lanka, whatever their race or religion, to be behind their team. I have met some Tamil people in the tea-picking hill areas that profess to support the Indian team. This, however, seems to come mainly from the women who seem to have a soft spot for Rahul Dravid. Some Muslims similarly talk of a love for the Pakistani team. They are hard-pushed to say whom they support in a Sri Lanka-Pakistan contest.</p>",

One club, the wonderfully named Nondescripts Cricket Club, obviously eschewed racial and religious criteria and today has Aravinda de Silva, Sangakkara the wicket keeper and Russel Arnold among its players. In the pavilions of these clubs you can get an idea of their respective origins. Hussains, Suleimans, Latifs and Razzaks are some of the names that you can see on the lists of past players and captains at the Moors Club. In the old pavilion of the Nondescripts Cricket Club, with its large fans and well-stocked bar, the names of those that have represented Ceylon or Sri Lanka from the club are proudly displayed. These are not just cricket clubs. They are real sports clubs with rugby, hockey, athletics, squash, tennis and swimming. They are very social places where the bar is open in the evening. 'Today these clubs are open to all,' as one member of the Tamil Club told me. 'We have had Sinhalese players and presidents for many years. There is no discrimination in Sri Lankan cricket.' The London office of Tamil supporters does not believe this is the case. They talk of the Sri Lankan cricket establishment as one of the best examples of 'Sinhala racism'. A spokesman said: 'Muralitharan is not a good role model - he has been corrupted by the Sinhalese.' The spokesman also said there was very little cricket in the north due to an acute lack of facilities and equipment and a need to concentrate on 'more important things'. It is not Tamil policy to support the Sri Lankan national side. On the 1998 Sri Lankan tour of England they called for a boycott and also 'to cheer and support the English cricket team'. In the 1999 World Cup when Sri Lanka played South Africa, a light aircraft buzzed the ground displaying banners reading 'killing Tamils is not cricket' and 'South Africa - we support you'. I don't know how the Tamil community in Britain reacted to these calls, but I have generally found the people of Sri Lanka, whatever their race or religion, to be behind their team. I have met some Tamil people in the tea-picking hill areas that profess to support the Indian team. This, however, seems to come mainly from the women who seem to have a soft spot for Rahul Dravid. Some Muslims similarly talk of a love for the Pakistani team. They are hard-pushed to say whom they support in a Sri Lanka-Pakistan contest.",

Last week, the Sun published scraps of letters supplied by a 17-year-old arsonist who claimed they were sent to him by Robert Thompson. The writer, portrayed as a paradigm of depravity, had watched Silence of the Lambs (featuring a 'deranged, flesh-eating psychiatrist'), played a shoot 'em-up computer game ('sinister and violent') and expressed pleasure when a relative had a new baby, thus proving beyond reasonable doubt that he was 'obsessed with tots'.

      "body": "<p>There is blood in Fleet Street's swirling waters again - but this time it's because the sharks are biting lumps out of each other. Lord Rothermere's Daily Mail and Richard Desmond's Daily Express are locked in mutual savaging as though their business lives depended on it: and perhaps Desmond's does. </p> <p>Did you know that the first Lord Rothermere was a fan of Hitler and Mosley - and that the F\u00fchrer once wrote to his 'very esteemed' pal proclaiming 'that new Germany has no more upstanding and warm-hearted friend in England than you'? </p> <p>Did you know that the third lord, Vere, 'lost his virginity in a Cairo brothel with cubicles separated only by curtains' - and 'thought so much of his family that he kept a mistress for 15 years and drove his sad, lonely wife to death'? </p> <p>Did you know that Jonathan, the current Lord R, had 'fathered an illegitimate son' by a New Zealand girl who once worked for his mum - and that while his lordship 'preaches about single parents' the boy has to live 'on the other side of the world', seldom, if ever, meeting 'the father who plays no part in his upbringing'? </p> <p>It is, to be frank, entirely possible that you knew all or most of this. Harold Harmsworth's admiration for the Nazis has featured in enough books to stock a public library. Vere Harmsworth's adventures in a Cairo brothel are a quote from an interview freely given before the last owner of the Daily Mail died, and he, anyway, was never an apostle of family values. 'What does that phrase mean?' he once asked. 'I've not the least idea! It doesn't mean anything. Today, the whole idea is that morality is a matter of opinion.' </p> <p>But whether or not they knew this old stuff, Express readers were force-fed it again in a series of double-page spreads from an anonymous pen, each bearing the plaintive injunction: 'Show this article to a Daily Mail reader.' </p> <p>There has been nothing like it in national papers since Robert Maxwell's hatred of Rupert Murdoch sank with a big splash off the Canary Islands, and perhaps since Beaverbrook's ancient Express and Rothermere's ancient Mail wrestled in mud through the Thirties. </p> <p>Ancient history matters here because tribal loyalties and family rivalries still matter. Beaverbrook and Harold, the first Lord Rothermere, were friends. In the early Twenties, Harold rescued Beaverbrook's failing Expresses and his Daily Mail and General Trust owned 49 per cent of them. </p> <p>But Beaverbrook, in the words of the biographer S.J.Taylor, was a cannibal 'who ate what he loved, he ate his friends'. A decade later, as the Mail began to slide in turn, Beaverbrook sold his own DMGT holdings for a fat profit and used that cash to hasten its fall. 'Rothermere used to be my brother,' he said, 'but he has no more brotherly love now that the Express has passed the Mail.' </p> <p>For the 50 years since, these two unbrotherly empires have been locked in epic combat for middle market England. In the Fifties and Sixties, the Express rose to more than four million copies while the Mail slid to near half that level and the fight looked almost over. </p> <p>In the Eighties and Nineties, it was the tabloid Mail which surged and the Express - passing haplessly from owner to owner - which battled vainly against decline. </p> <p>That was one reason, last year, why the Mail emerged as a surprise bidder when Lord Hollick at United abruptly decided to jettison the Expresses and the Star: revenge and final family victory. There were other more prosaic reasons, of course - the thought of making the Express a tame, subservient sister, even a freesheet - but there was emotion to the bid; and emotion, too, when Desmond jumped out of the undergrowth of glossy people and porn mags to seize the prize. Here was the ultimate challenge. The Mail warned shareholders about stalling profits because of the investment it needed to finish off its rival. </p> <p>It declared war, belabouring 'the pornographer Desmond' in print and targeting hundreds of thousands of Express readers with individual letters denouncing the man and his record. Since Desmond finally changed Express editors and editorial direction last month, that onslaught has grown yet more ferocious. The Mail signed a tit-for-tat deal with Hello! against Desmond's OK! Free sample copies of the Mail , with a wrap-around article from The Guardian about Desmond's porn publications, have poured out by the million. More damagingly still, newsagents have been offered a \u00a35 bonus for every Express reader they convert to the Mail. </p> <p>The Mail's circulation director may declare that there is 'no war', that these tactics are only 'standard news trade practice' - but no one in the industry believes him. The Mail is going for the jugular and has no compunction about making it personal, either. When the Express's new editor, Chris Williams (an old Mail hand years before) got his job, the boot went in. No vision, no popular touch - the message from Mail sources was 'he left here because it was obvious he'd hit a glass ceiling'. Only Mail cast-offs, it seemed, were available to the Express. </p> <p>How, three months in, goes the battle? Both editors, Williams and Paul Dacre at the Mail, have taken to running anonymous propaganda stories on their respective page twos hailing triumph. Dacre favours a slightly oleaginous hand-wringing. There is industry 'concern as Express sales go into freefall'... and worrying 'signs that advertisers are deserting the once-profitable paper'. </p> <p>Williams is more direct, and more frequent with his dispatches from the front. The Daily Mail is the Daily Wail or the Daily Fail. Its agenda reeks of 'bitterness and negativity', its columns resound to the 'rantings of Little Englanders' (and a rather bizarre grouping of Mail haters, from Stephen Fry to Vanessa Feltz, have been summoned to vent their ire). </p> <p>Rhetoric, though, is one thing, facts rather another. Williams has one set of facts on his side. City analysts don't relish old-fashioned competition. It costs too much. Mail Group shares are down to around \u00a37.80p now as against \u00a313.23 last April. Though the family Rothermere never let profit margins ruin a good long-term strategy, there is some strain there. </p> <p>But Desmond's Express, alas, is far more vulnerable to a blast of fact. Circulation of the Daily Express plunged definitively below the million mark in January, to 979,000 (as against the Mail's 2,480,000). The Sunday Express fared even worse, down to 880,000. </p> <p>There are no official February figures yet, but it's widely reckoned both slides have continued apace and that the Daily Express will be lucky to post 950,000. That has an impact on the money it can charge advertisers. Desmond may be rich personally, but his firings and cuttings show that his pockets aren't bottomless. </p> <p>For the moment, he will have to dig deep - and time is not on his side. Williams may be producing a bouncier, more celebrity-studded Express - 'Scary Spice is the new Blonde Bombshell' - but the average age of his readers is still the oldest around. His paper, moreover, seems calculated to sheer away the thousands of young ABC readers that Rosie Boycott tried to woo with serious politics and serious investiga tions (now scrapped). He must, in short, rebuild from the foundations up. There are no quick fixes on offer, only the prospect of more months of decline. </p> <p>Nothing, though, is ever impossible in newspaper wars (as the Mail 's own recovery shows). The Mail may be vulnerable if, as at present, it follows the Express's celeb agenda too slavishly - 'Uma: I see myself as fat' - and repels more staid or serious readers. It may also be making a mistake in hammering the Express so openly. </p> <p>Only seven per cent of Mail readers also take the Express (as opposed, of course, to 17 per cent the other way round). Canny industry hands wonder whether it isn't obsessive to get drawn into a dogfight. But those hands, too, are embarrassed and anxious over the Express 's open virulence - particularly the picture of Lord Rothermere's young wife that went with the tale of an illegitimate son. </p> <p>As newspapers celebrate ten years of the Press Complaints Commission and being tenderer about privacy, that's a prehistoric message to send. Desmond is in danger of becoming a reviled outsider. </p> <p>The first Lord Rothermere had a personal motto: never respond, never answer back. And Lord Beaverbrook, too, was capable of unpredictable warmth. The first Lord Rothermere, he wrote after Harold's death, 'was great in vision, courage and loyalty'. Will Desmond or the fourth Lord Rothermere have to die before we hear a kind word about either of them?</p>",

He must, in short, rebuild from the foundations up. There are no quick fixes on offer, only the prospect of more months of decline. Nothing, though, is ever impossible in newspaper wars (as the Mail 's own recovery shows). The Mail may be vulnerable if, as at present, it follows the Express's celeb agenda too slavishly - 'Uma: I see myself as fat' - and repels more staid or serious readers. It may also be making a mistake in hammering the Express so openly. Only seven per cent of Mail readers also take the Express (as opposed, of course, to 17 per cent the other way round). Canny industry hands wonder whether it isn't obsessive to get drawn into a dogfight. But those hands, too, are embarrassed and anxious over the Express 's open virulence - particularly the picture of Lord Rothermere's young wife that went with the tale of an illegitimate son. As newspapers celebrate ten years of the Press Complaints Commission and being tenderer about privacy, that's a prehistoric message to send. Desmond is in danger of becoming a reviled outsider. The first Lord Rothermere had a personal motto: never respond, never answer back. And Lord Beaverbrook, too, was capable of unpredictable warmth. The first Lord Rothermere, he wrote after Harold's death, 'was great in vision, courage and loyalty'. Will Desmond or the fourth Lord Rothermere have to die before we hear a kind word about either of them?",

      "bodyText": "ALAN SHEARER MAY be back, but even the Newcastle captain can't do anything to assist a defence who have now failed to keep a clean sheet in 23 matches. Yesterday's seemingly-inevitable goal came from Manchester City striker Shaun Goater and was enough to earn them a win which may prove crucial to their survival chances. Newcastle, bolstered by Shearer's return after knee surgery, were still talking about a Uefa Cup place before this setback, but that now seems a remote prospect. With Shearer still short of full fitness and policed impec cably by former United team-mate Steve Howey, City keeper Nicky Weaver enjoyed one of his quietest matches of the season against a team whose own campaign is fading away into mid-table mediocrity. United had gone into the game with the shadow of their La Manga trip hanging over them. They jetted out there immediately after a dismal performance in their last game, at Charlton - a sunshine break which infuriated supporters. Manager Bobby Robson made a spirited defence of his decision to go to Spain and the early stages suggested it had been a beneficial break. Shots from Clarence Acuna and Kevin Gallacher in the open ing minutes went close and wafted away some of the tension at a subdued St James' Park. However, the fans' frustration at Newcastle's recent form was never far from the surface and threatened to emerge as their team failed to build on such encouraging beginnings. True, Wayne Quinn was not far away with a firmly-struck free-kick and City keeper Nicky Weaver also had to make straightforward saves from Shearer and Shola Ameobi. But Newcastle, deprived of the midfield experience of Gary Speed and Robert Lee through illness and injury, were always struggling to impose their authority on a shapeless first half. Points, not quality, were all that mattered to City and they were undoubtedly satisfied by the way they stifled Newcastle before the interval. Andrei Kanchelskis provided the only attacking outlet of real threat and he caused several awkward moments for Quinn, playing his first game since signing a permanent deal at United. Kanchelskis skirted the right touchline and showed he still possesses enough speed off the mark to embarrass defenders, as he did when his cross was almost turned into his own net by Aaron Hughes. Tony Grant also tested keeper Shay Given but, otherwise, it was a scuffling, gritty first half from City which achieved its objective. The second half began as before, prompting Robson to the touchline after only five minutes to wave his arms in a demand for more from his players. His exhortations had minimal effect until the 57th minute when Shearer's right-wing cross was headed over by Acuna after it bounced awkwardly in front of the Chilean midfielder. Four minutes later, City were ahead when Kanchelskis finally deserted his touchline beat to pick up the ball in midfield. He made smooth progress before freeing Shaun Goater, whose calmness was admirable before he guided the ball wide of Given. There should have been another goal for City in the 67th minute, but former Magpie Darren Huckerby shot wide. Robson had seen enough and, seconds later, made a triple substitution in a vain attempt to turn the tide. Newcastle United: Given, Griffin, Goma, Hughes, Quinn, Solano, Acuna (Barton 68), Dyer, Gallacher (Glass 68), Shearer, Ameobi (Lua-Lua 68). Subs not used: Harper, Cordone. Manchester City: Weaver, Wiekens, Dunne, Howey, Tiatto, Granville, Grant, Kanchelskis, Haaland (Charvet 62), Huckerby (Whitley 77), Goater. Subs not used: Nash, Prior,Ostenstad.

Before the current regime began dragging the club into the 21st century, and before Francis returned to the club he graced as a player, Birmingham were the epitome of instability, shifting divisions a dizzying nine times in 16 years, and struggling against bankruptcy.

He uses Ipswich, the side they conquered in the semi-final to book their day out in Cardiff, as his yardstick. 'Ipswich have done the right thing,' he explains. 'The chairman has been very supportive of the manager, the manager has very much kept faith with his players - just tickling with the squad each season - until they eventually got their reward. It's possible the same could happen here.' </p> <p>Having also beaten Premiership sides Tottenham and Newcastle during the Cup run, Birmingham have developed a taste for licking illustrious opponents - yet it has not distracted from the primary aim of escaping Division One.

'We're there on merit, nobody gave us a bye,' he remarks, sharply. 'Our character, spirit and work ethic gets us through most games, and if we can deny them space - and we have got technique as well - I think we might cause an upset.' The 31,000 Blues who quickly snapped up their full allocation for the Millennium Stadium believe him. 'It's a club which normally doesn't have a lot to celebrate but people here are incredibly excited,' adds team-mate Marcelo. </p> <p>Francis, contemplating the club's health compared to the day he took over in 1996, speaks of a transformation: 'The club was badly run down, then the two Davids [Gold, the chairman, and Sullivan] and Karren came to the club, and there was a period of improvement while Barry Fry was here. But really there was a lot of work to do when I first took over. I didn't realise quite how big a job it was. </p> <p>'It took me about 18 months to two years to change the base of the squad. I inherited a squad that was very large on numbers but very short on quality. Sweeping changes were needed - in the first year it was as important to me to get players out the door as it was to pick up points. Once the squad started to come together we could start to think about promotion, and the last two years it has been very much a possibility. We've missed out twice in the play-off semi-finals but I believe we've come back stronger for it.' </p> <p>Francis has also come back stronger from setbacks in his managerial career. Sacked by QPR after 11 months, before being 'dismissed' (his disdain is unmistakable as he spits the word out) from Sheffield Wednesday after four years which look like nirvana compared to the Owls' current predicament, he then endured a year in the wilderness before Birmingham invited him back. Five years on, club and manager are flourishing. In spite of the constant rumours of sparks flying between manager and board, both parties claim the alliance is all about committed people who want to thrive. Contrary to popular belief, Brady claims she and Francis have never got along better: 'People try to make out there is a personality clash but that's not true. We couldn't work as closely if there wasn't a friendship and relationship there. If we lost Trevor we'd struggle to find a replacement as good.' </p> <p>Prancis possesses such genuine affection for his club he is a little worried he might feel overwhelmed this afternoon.

      "body": "<p>When even Sky Sport's hype kings recognise they would look foolish to bill Manchester United versus Arsenal as vital to the title race - sorry, procession - with three months of the season still to play, it sends out a gloomy message to everyone bar the champions. </p> <p>So run-of-the-mill is this for United, Sir Alex Ferguson didn't even bother with the traditional pre-match quips for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's pleasure, choosing to attend a lunch date instead. It was left to assistant Steve McClaren to pass on the message: 'If we win, we are 16 points ahead with only 10 games left and that would put us in a very strong position. The manager has said we would want shooting if we lost that sort of lead. They beat us at Old Trafford three years ago when they won the League, so we can't leave the door open for Arsenal. We have to slam it damn well shut!'

So run-of-the-mill is this for United, Sir Alex Ferguson didn't even bother with the traditional pre-match quips for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's pleasure, choosing to attend a lunch date instead. It was left to assistant Steve McClaren to pass on the message: 'If we win, we are 16 points ahead with only 10 games left and that would put us in a very strong position. The manager has said we would want shooting if we lost that sort of lead. They beat us at Old Trafford three years ago when they won the League, so we can't leave the door open for Arsenal. We have to slam it damn well shut!' Not that there is much of a crack for Arsenal to peer through, win, lose or draw.

He is a highly trusted confidant. The two are close friends - he calls the new coach by his familiar name 'Svennis' - and both are great believers in the importance of psychology in sport. 'There's the playing side and the systems and all that. But the main thing to helping the England team is in the players' brains. Mr Eriksson take the same approach,' says Railo. 'There are no limitations to what England can achieve if the mental side is right. England have all the potential they need to be the best - to beat any national team, to be literally the best team in the world. They have the skills and the technique. But the mental side of things has been badly lacking.' </p> <p>Together the Norwegian and the Swede intend to change that, as they did at Lazio. Railo likens the bunch of unhappy, under-achieving three lions that Eriksson has taken on to the group of players he inherited at Lazio in 1997. 'There was a negative thinking culture. Even the best players thought, \"Lazio are a losing team. Lazio are always unlucky. Lazio can never beat Juventus or Milan.\" To turn things around we had to take out some players I call \"energy killers\" as well as prima donnas, millionaires, players with lots of money but egoistic. They were the carriers of the negative thoughts.' Some players were shown the door. </p> <p>Then came the task of rebuilding. 'We had to take care of the positive thinkers and the strong personalities,' recalls Railo. He cites Yugoslav international Sinisa Mihajlovic as one who became one of Lazio's 'leaders'. 'Mr Eriksson and I agree that you need three players of the 11 who are calm, strong, not afraid of losing, who take the lead and stir up the others. Three significant players with the right personality can turn a team around, because negative thoughts spread much faster among players than positive ones,' warns Railo. 'The trainer must have an instrument out there as he himself isn't on the field. In all his teams, Svennis always has at least three players embodying his ideas and carrying the positive culture to the others. He will do the same thing with England.' </p> <p>Happily, the Norwegian believes England have plenty of potential 'leaders'. He thinks naming names would put unfair pressure of them - Sol Campbell, Steven Gerrard and Joe Cole seem obvious candidates - but does admit David Beckham is one. 'He has the potential to have the inner calm that's so important and which Pele and Maradona had,' says Railo. 'Beckham had too volatile a temperament' - something Eriksson equates with weakness, and possibly the reason for Paul Ince and Dennis Wise's omission from his first squad. On the plus side, though, he says: 'Beckham has very good self-confidence, but he's not aware of how to spread this self-confidence to his team-mates. He needs a good coach to help him.' </p> <p>Railo's analysis of England's shortcomings under Kevin Keegan, painfully obvious at Euro 2000, come from a distinguished professor of psychology but echo those of every long-suffering fan. 'They had pretty low self-confidence. There was too little team feeling. It was a collection of individuals, not a team. There were factions, which is the wrong way to build a team. There were negative thoughts. And fear. Too many players got rid of the ball as soon as they got it to avoid making a mistake, because of their fear of failure.' In that latter failing, at least, they are not alone. Railo says 90 per cent of footballers behave like that either some or all of the time. </p> <p>He plans to change that in one-to-one sessions with England players who Eriksson feels would benefit from talking to him. Forget Eileen Drewery; Railo is serious. Over the years, he has helped stars such as Mats Wilander, Stefan Edburg, Grete Waitz and Ingrid Kristensen, who became the only woman ever to hold the records for the 5,000 metres, 10,000 metres and marathon at the same time. She calls him 'a remarkable man'. </p> <p>His eight books include one with Waitz about winning the New York marathon nine times in a row. His next, Inside Football: The Mental Game, co-written with Eriksson and setting out their shared philosophy of achieving soccer success, is out in April, after the two World Cup qualifiers that will tell us if Sven-G\u00f6ran, Tord and Willi represent a new era based on Scandinavian sophistication or yet another false dawn. </p> <p>So what does Railo actually say to sports people to, as he puts it, 'change their heads'? 'When athletes are wrongly programmed, I take out all the mental blockedness, clean the brain and replace the negative feelings like fear, self-doubt and lack of self-confidence with positive thoughts,' he explains. 'It's obvious England have to change their attitude, culture and way of thinking.' </p> <p>He has helped strikers who had forgotten how to score to regain their touch and runners who no longer believed they could finish first to do exactly that. Starting on Wednesday at Villa Park, Eriksson's players will now be on this particular psychologist's couch. Here's hoping the English patient responds to treatment.</p>",

He has helped strikers who had forgotten how to score to regain their touch and runners who no longer believed they could finish first to do exactly that. Starting on Wednesday at Villa Park, Eriksson's players will now be on this particular psychologist's couch. Here's hoping the English patient responds to treatment.",

Bold, brash, confident, not to say arrogant, he made Europe's biggest shopping centre rise from an industrial wasteland and then made a moribund football club vibrant again. His vision was complemented by Kevin Keegan's regime, full of swashbuckling footballers who played with verve and a smile. Progress on the pitch was matched by ambition off it. </p> <p>It's now a decade since the Hall-Shepherd-Hall revolution galvanised the broken shell that degenerating Newcastle United had become. Five years on, it seemed that Keegan and Co could touch the stars. Instead Keegan went and the club has fallen, bumpily, back to earth with further casualties, yet still gazing hopefully to the heavens. </p> <p>The days of counting new signings in scores of millions of pounds are over. These days, Shepherd is just as happy to count new seats by the thousand in St James' Park, rebuilt for the second time in a decade. The pace is slower, as 68-year-old Bobby Robson regroups and Shepherd admits that Keegan's near-miss with nirvana in 1996 - when Manchester United hauled them in as they threatened to run away with their first title since 1927 - was a crossroad. </p> <p>'Had we won the title in 1996 it would have made an unbelievable difference,' Shepherd admitted. 'We wouldn't have had the hangover that we've had ever since. That whole 12-point lead thing. There's really been a hangover since then and we're still trying to get rid of that hangover now.' </p> <p>Shepherd has the sober, experienced figure of Robson to do just that after two more post-Keegan bingeing sessions with Kenny Dalglish and Rudd Gullit, indulging like boozers in a brewery. But their judgment, notably in the transfer market, was flawed. Did they fritter away the inheritance? Remember, the forwards alone that Keegan handed over included Alan Shearer, Les Ferdinand, Peter Beardsley, David Ginola and Tino Asprilla. </p> <p>'I don't believe they came here to do a bad job,' said Shepherd, as he would bearing in mind his responsibility in appointing them. 'They came to do a good job. Nobody tries to destroy a football club and Kenny certainly did what he thought was his best and so did Gullit. Unfortunately, it did not work out but there are no guarantees in football. It's just unfortunate for Daglish and Gullit that it didn't work out for them or the club.' </p> <p>There was a time when it looked as though it would not work out for Shepherd, the head of a Tyneside offshore engineering firm and lifelong United fan. In 1998 he and Douglas Hall made front-page news in Sunday tabloids for, among other things, allegedly making insulting remarks about North-East women to an undercover reporter. Shepherd and Hall junior resigned, later apologised and then returned to the fold. It's behind him now and he does not want to discuss it. </p> <p>The descent from Keegan's dizzy heights accelerated in 1999 when Gullit's feud with Shearer made him deeply unpopular on Tyneside, culminating in the manager's resignation after the home derby with Sunderland, which Shearer-less Newcastle lost 2-1.Yet Shepherd still has a high regard for Gullit and does not rate him the poorest manager he has worked with. </p> <p>'You can only speak as you find,' he said. 'At the of his reign - after that Sunderland game - he came to me and said that he'd let everyone down, let the supporters down, let the management down. \"I'm leaving from today and I don't want any compensation,\" he said. He didn't ask for a penny, nor did he receive a penny. So I've got to speak well of the guy. Unfortunately for him, it did not come off on the field. His man management was not, perhaps, the best. </p> <p>'My managers' pecking order? The best obviously had to be Keegan. Then Robson, who is still in position. Then you'd go for Gullit and then Dalglish. Dalglish spent probably more money and achieved less. I know he got to the Cup Final in '98 but there were some bad buys. Gullit didn't cover himself in glory but he did buy Kieron Dyer which probably makes up for some dodgy ones.' </p> <p>And talking of buys, the sprees have dried up. Robson, noted for his astute buys from the likes of Arnold Muhren for Ipswich a generation ago to Ronaldo for PSV and Barcelona, has had to work with washers compared to Keegan and Dalglish, in particular. Remarkably, Newcastle have spent \u00a392 million on incoming transfers since Euro 96 - no club has spent more. Dalglish spent almost \u00a337 million in just 18 months; Gullit \u00a332 million in a year. </p> <p>Keegan, who began in 1992 and left five years later, spent \u00a361 million. All three sold heavily too, but were net spenders to the tune of almost \u00a360 million. Robson, by stark comparison, is breaking even on sales and buys. </p> <p>With Robson in place and a refurbished ground accommodating the Premiership's second-best support, should Shepherd not be investing heavily again in the side? </p> <p>'Firstly, on the money side, it's stupid to say what you have in your pocket, and what you don't. It would be commercially stupid. Secondly, the transfer system in my opinion will be abolished. It will not stand up in its present form. If other clubs want to delve into the transfer market in a big way, that's up to them, but it is not for Newcastle.' </p> <p>Shepherd insist this is not at the behest of the club's plc board. Yet Keegan, when he quit in 1997, suggested the constraints of the club 'going public' had left its mark. Shepherd is unimpressed with the argument. </p> <p>'I disagree with that. You look at Leeds and they have paid \u00a330 million on Rio Ferdinand and Robbie Keane and good luck to them. I'm positive the transfer system is dead. Obviously something will take its place, otherwise the whole game will be unworkable. But the present system is finished.' </p> <p>Shepherd sees a compromise ahead with transfers restricted to one or two 'windows' a year and players only allowed to move once in any season to prevent 'club hopping' by players constantly taking advantage of their freedom. </p> <p>So can Newcastle, backed by their 52,000-strong Toon Army, be a major force? Shepherd is convinced of it - and convinced it will happen in Europe, too. 'I think there will be a European Super League,' he said. 'It will happen in the next three or four years. And I see Newcastle's future in that league, definitely.' </p> <p>But with Robson already well past normal retirement age, will he be around even next season to prepare for such adventures? Or will Alan Shearer step up soon? </p> <p>'Bobby has a 12-month rolling contract, so every day he wakes up he has 12 months in front of him as manager. As for Alan, I'm sure he'd like to stay, but he has four years left on a playing contract and I hope he will still be scoring goals then. Four years is a long time in football.

Between them the pair managed just that in the 67th minute, each applying a scuffed finish to Hall's low cross from the left and the latter watching his effort creep across the line. In fairness Hartson led the line effectively for the next few minutes, and saw a shot of his own fly narrowly wide. </p> <p>Meanwhile Chris Powell, England's latest and unlikeliest recruit was quite impressive.

He barely managed to make his presence felt before Charlton snatched the lead in the first minute of the second half with a goal illustrating all the subtlety and movement that Coventry lacked. Kishishev was played into the penalty area by Mathias Svensson, and his chip forward was met superbly by a volley on the turn by Jonatan Johansson that beat Hedman from the six yard line. Strachan sent on John Aloisi to help Hartson chase an equaliser. Between them the pair managed just that in the 67th minute, each applying a scuffed finish to Hall's low cross from the left and the latter watching his effort creep across the line. In fairness Hartson led the line effectively for the next few minutes, and saw a shot of his own fly narrowly wide. Meanwhile Chris Powell, England's latest and unlikeliest recruit was quite impressive. Nothing special, but he was marking Coventry's liveliest player in Thompson, and he did the job well.",

      "body": "<p>Plans by the Conservative Party to make marriage pay by awarding tax breaks to some married couples will complicate the tax system and could lead to growth in the black economy, tax advisers believe. </p> <p>The Conservative Party plans to allow married couples where one partner earns nothing or very little and where there is at least one child under 11, to transfer the unused personal tax allowance to their spouse in order to reduce the family tax bill. The allowance would also apply to people staying at home to look after elderly relatives who receive the invalid care allowance. </p> <p>Standing to benefit most are families where one partner earns nothing and the other is a basic-rate taxpayer. Here, the non-working partner would transfer his or her personal allowance, worth \u00a34,535 from April, to their spouse. His or her tax bill would be reduced by the value of basic rate tax on this sum. Higher-rate taxpayers would not be eligible for relief at 40 per cent. </p> <p>The new allowance, to operate from 2003, would be given in addition to the children's tax credit, due to be introduced in April this year, which is Labour's replacement for the former married couple's allowance, which was axed a year ago. </p> <p>The Tories also plan to beef up the children's tax credit by giving up to \u00a3200 a year to families with children under five. </p> <p>But a crucial difference in approach between Labour and the Tories is that the Children's Tax Credit goes to parents regardless of marital status. Even single-sex couples can benefit. While the Tories plan to keep this credit, they are determined to recognise marriage through the tax system. </p> <p>Tax experts agree that, judged purely on financial grounds, the Tories' revamped married couple's allowance would deliver extra money to couples in the target group. </p> <p>But accountant Richard Murphy believes it could be open to abuse: 'It will encourage people to take cash jobs and not declare it.' </p> <p>Murphy also predicts that by aiming the allowance at a specific group, the Tories would add to the already mind-boggling complexity of the tax system. People trying to work out their bills under the self-assessment system would face yet another hurdle. </p> <p>Accountants feel the tax system has grown more complicated under Labour because of its emphasis on aiming tax reductions at certain groups through allowances and credits. Now, the Conservatives are at it, too. </p> <p>Murphy also foresees administrative difficulties if people move in or out of work part of the way through a year. </p> <p>Mike Brewer, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, points out that it would not affect as many people as the old Married Couples' Allowance did. 'The old one went to 10 million married couples with or without children.' The Tories have said the new allowance would go to around a million families, although Brewer believes 2 million could benefit. </p> <p>However, while the Married Couple's Allowance was worth less than \u00a3200 when it was abolished a year ago, the new one would be worth fives times as much to those who qualify. </p> <p>Brewer adds: 'The poorest won't benefit because they pay little or no tax. The million lone parents who stay at home to look after children won't benefit.' </p> <p>Martin Barnes, director of the Child Poverty Action Group, is also concerned that the plan ignores some of the poorest families. 'We support any proposal that improves support for families with children,' he says. 'Our concern about this measure is that it discriminates against single and unmarried parents.' </p> <p>CPAG is also worried that the public spending cuts the Conservatives would implement to pay for their tax cuts could affect low-income households. </p> <p>Many women work because they enjoy it, but even on purely financial grounds many parents may decide that the Tory plan fails: wives may earn more from working than they get from the tax break, although childcare costs would have to be considered. </p> <p>The Conservatives want to encourage marriage, and to reward families who take a traditional approach to childcare. </p> <p>But whether the tax break would encourage families to follow the traditional model if they are not already doing so is debatable. </p> <p>Last week's announcement was the latest in a series on tax from the Tories as they gear up for a general lection (see box). But it is far too early for taxpayers to judge who would leave them better off. </p> <p>As Battersby of KPMG points out, Labour still has the opportunity to out-manoeuvre the Conservatives through the Budget on 7 March: 'All the advantages are with the Chancellor.' </p> <p>In any case, tax rates are only part of the story: fuel taxes and other 'indirect' forms of taxation have to be taken into account. </p> <p>Mike Brewer, at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says that broadly speaking, the plans announced by the Tories so far will not leave anyone worse off in tax terms. 'For pensioners on savings and for families they are going beyond what Labour is doing at the moment.' </p> <p>For many voters tax may not be the deciding factor, particularly if they can barely comprehend the schemes on offer. </p> <p>Even those who believe they will pay less tax under the Tories may decide that they are unwilling to pay the price of the \u00a38 billion of public sector savings the Conservatives plan as a way of paying for their tax cuts.</p> <p><strong>Your children could be a credit to you </strong></p> <p>More than 2 million parents could miss out on the new children's tax credit, worth up to \u00a3442 a year, because they have not claimed it.

Last week's announcement was the latest in a series on tax from the Tories as they gear up for a general lection (see box). But it is far too early for taxpayers to judge who would leave them better off. As Battersby of KPMG points out, Labour still has the opportunity to out-manoeuvre the Conservatives through the Budget on 7 March: 'All the advantages are with the Chancellor.' In any case, tax rates are only part of the story: fuel taxes and other 'indirect' forms of taxation have to be taken into account. Mike Brewer, at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says that broadly speaking, the plans announced by the Tories so far will not leave anyone worse off in tax terms. 'For pensioners on savings and for families they are going beyond what Labour is doing at the moment.' For many voters tax may not be the deciding factor, particularly if they can barely comprehend the schemes on offer. Even those who believe they will pay less tax under the Tories may decide that they are unwilling to pay the price of the \u00a38 billion of public sector savings the Conservatives plan as a way of paying for their tax cuts. Your children could be a credit to you More than 2 million parents could miss out on the new children's tax credit, worth up to \u00a3442 a year, because they have not claimed it.

In banking the going rates are still about one month's pay per year of service - although rates 50 and 100 per cent higher do occur.

If you take legal action for unfair dismissal, compensation can now be as much as \u00a351,700. For years the maximum level was pegged at \u00a312,000, a sum that did not frighten employers.

      "body": "<p>The last 18 months have been a rollercoaster ride for investors in technology-related investment trusts, yet despite painful falls over the last year most of these trusts still carry healthy premiums. </p> <p>This state of affairs baffles investment trust experts and seems to represent a triumph of hope over reality. But while investors should not rush to buy a tech-related trust on a premium, they shouldn't run for the door now either.</p> <p>The technology-related frenzy, which took off in October 1999, peaked on 10 March 2000. During this period the FTSE World index rose by about 17.5 per cent, the Specialist: Technology, Media and Telecommunications investment trust sector rose by 108 per cent while the sector's key funds Henderson Technology and Finsbury Technology made returns of 162 per cent and 274 per cent respectively. This phenomenal period saw percentage premiums on technology investment trusts soar into the high teens and early 20s.</p> <p>The ensuing correction, interrupted by a summer rally, drove the index down 1.5 per cent, the sector average down 28.6 per cent and the Henderson Technology and Finsbury Technology trusts down by 40 per cent and 22 per cent respectively. Yet both trusts trade on a 13 per cent premium to their asset value, which means potential investors would have to pay 113p to gain exposure to 100p of the trust's portfolio.</p> <p>It is quite common for investment trusts' discounts to narrow or even premiums to rise as their underlying portfolio performs well - strong returns drive demand for the shares, which pushes their prices upwards. However, it is virtually unheard of for the opposite not to happen. As trusts on tight discounts or premiums suffer poor portfolio returns, they invariably suffer a ratings downgrade as existing investors start to look elsewhere and potential new investors are suddenly less enamoured. It remains a fact that many investors prefer to buy after a stock or trust has rallied rather than after it has bombed.</p> <p>But technology trusts today almost universally carry premiums in double figures. This suggests there has been little selling pressure, either because investors expect a rebound, or have sensibly taken a long-term view, or perhaps, despite these falls, still have significant capital gains tax problems to worry about.</p> <p>Tom Tuite-Dalton, an investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities Europe, tipped premium-rated technology trusts as a 'sell' in early October 2000 (just after the summer rally had fizzled out and before the severe correction started). He admits to being mystified as to why the premiums have remained for so long.</p> <p>Tuite-Dalton said: 'History shows us 20 per cent premiums rarely last forever. I think many investors who bought technology funds relatively late now sit on substantial losses and don't want to realise these losses - they hope instead for a bounce, perhaps driven by a soft landing in the US economy.</p> <p>'Investors cannot dismiss technology as an investment and there is a good rationale for specialist managers. However, even if there is a rally in tech stocks I expect tech-related investment trusts' share prices to rise more slowly and not fully reflect the returns in their share prices. I would be very surprised if these premium levels still exist in six months time.'</p> <p>One argument put forward to support the existence and continuance of these premiums, which Tuite-Dalton agrees with to some extent, is that unlike after previous rallies, the investment trust companies largely resisted the urge to launch more trusts or issue new shares. The supply of technology-related investment trust shares did not increase to meet the demand and consequently there has not been a notable oversupply.</p> <p>Brian Ashford-Russell, manager of the Henderson Technology investment trusts and one of the industry's sages, believes this, along with investors' CGT positions and ongoing savings plans tied to the trusts, is largely behind the premium levels. Ashford-Russell was cautious amid the euphoria last year and now heads towards bullishness given the poor sentiment and flow of negative news about technology companies.</p> <p>He says: 'Once we have hit the bottom, technology will be a good place to invest again; it is still a great place to invest for the long-term.

      "bodyText": "The last 18 months have been a rollercoaster ride for investors in technology-related investment trusts, yet despite painful falls over the last year most of these trusts still carry healthy premiums. This state of affairs baffles investment trust experts and seems to represent a triumph of hope over reality. But while investors should not rush to buy a tech-related trust on a premium, they shouldn't run for the door now either. The technology-related frenzy, which took off in October 1999, peaked on 10 March 2000. During this period the FTSE World index rose by about 17.5 per cent, the Specialist: Technology, Media and Telecommunications investment trust sector rose by 108 per cent while the sector's key funds Henderson Technology and Finsbury Technology made returns of 162 per cent and 274 per cent respectively. This phenomenal period saw percentage premiums on technology investment trusts soar into the high teens and early 20s. The ensuing correction, interrupted by a summer rally, drove the index down 1.5 per cent, the sector average down 28.6 per cent and the Henderson Technology and Finsbury Technology trusts down by 40 per cent and 22 per cent respectively. Yet both trusts trade on a 13 per cent premium to their asset value, which means potential investors would have to pay 113p to gain exposure to 100p of the trust's portfolio. It is quite common for investment trusts' discounts to narrow or even premiums to rise as their underlying portfolio performs well - strong returns drive demand for the shares, which pushes their prices upwards. However, it is virtually unheard of for the opposite not to happen. As trusts on tight discounts or premiums suffer poor portfolio returns, they invariably suffer a ratings downgrade as existing investors start to look elsewhere and potential new investors are suddenly less enamoured. It remains a fact that many investors prefer to buy after a stock or trust has rallied rather than after it has bombed. But technology trusts today almost universally carry premiums in double figures. This suggests there has been little selling pressure, either because investors expect a rebound, or have sensibly taken a long-term view, or perhaps, despite these falls, still have significant capital gains tax problems to worry about. Tom Tuite-Dalton, an investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities Europe, tipped premium-rated technology trusts as a 'sell' in early October 2000 (just after the summer rally had fizzled out and before the severe correction started). He admits to being mystified as to why the premiums have remained for so long. Tuite-Dalton said: 'History shows us 20 per cent premiums rarely last forever. I think many investors who bought technology funds relatively late now sit on substantial losses and don't want to realise these losses - they hope instead for a bounce, perhaps driven by a soft landing in the US economy. 'Investors cannot dismiss technology as an investment and there is a good rationale for specialist managers. However, even if there is a rally in tech stocks I expect tech-related investment trusts' share prices to rise more slowly and not fully reflect the returns in their share prices. I would be very surprised if these premium levels still exist in six months time.' One argument put forward to support the existence and continuance of these premiums, which Tuite-Dalton agrees with to some extent, is that unlike after previous rallies, the investment trust companies largely resisted the urge to launch more trusts or issue new shares. The supply of technology-related investment trust shares did not increase to meet the demand and consequently there has not been a notable oversupply. Brian Ashford-Russell, manager of the Henderson Technology investment trusts and one of the industry's sages, believes this, along with investors' CGT positions and ongoing savings plans tied to the trusts, is largely behind the premium levels. Ashford-Russell was cautious amid the euphoria last year and now heads towards bullishness given the poor sentiment and flow of negative news about technology companies. He says: 'Once we have hit the bottom, technology will be a good place to invest again; it is still a great place to invest for the long-term. I think short-term news will be very bad and I expect to see a wave of earnings downgrades. Sentiment has been trashed and there is a lot of cash on the sidelines. I think we are approaching the sentiment and newsflow extreme and from this point we can do well. But I have to say there are good reasons for the poor sentiment, most notably the funding crisis in the telecoms sector.' Investors need to remember those who have been long-term investors in these trusts show very attractive profits despite the recent setbacks and technology is almost certain to be a major feature of stock market returns in the future. It is not time to cut and run but an 'eyes open' approach to existing or future technology-related investment trust exposure is crucial. \u0095 David Smith is investment funds editor of www.citywire.co.uk",
