      "bodyText": "Just when Reading looked sunk Tony Rougier parted the waves. In 16 sopping minutes at the end of this game, the Trinidadian international scored two goals, his first for the club, won the man-of-the-match award and rescued all three points for Reading. \"I'm very blessed by the grace of the almighty God to be among the elite at this club,\" he said, after an almost biblical flood had given way to a rainbow over the Thames Valley. \"It's a brilliant place to be.\" If God really is taking an interest in the Second Division, why is he withholding his infinite mercy from Oxford United? Robert Maxwell saddled them with a debt that grew to \u00a310m. One of his successors left an abandoned half-built stadium. Their centre forward, the ever-willing Steve Anthrobus, has not scored for 10 months. This defeat leaves Oxford six points adrift at the bottom of the table and lifts their bitterest rivals to the top. The famine must be over soon, surely? \"The club's been a mess for three years now,\" said their caretaker manager Mike Ford, the latest in a succession of conscientious men to attempt to forge a competitive team out of cast-offs, reclamation projects and Joey Beauchamp. \"Things have got to change.\" There are some hopeful signs, though even the most devout of Oxford fans is not yet ready to surrender to optimism. Last week it was announced that building work on the new stadium would resume. Today the chairman Firoz Kassam is due to discuss the managerial vacancy with Joe Kinnear. And on Saturday the team showed effort, character and ability enough to reduce their much more expensively assembled opponents to desperate measures. As the centre of the pitch disappeared under water, Reading flooded forward. Lee Hodges forced Richard Knight into a flying save and then, from the consequent corner, lured him into a miscalculation that allowed Rougier to head his first and level the scores at 3-3. Then, with four minutes left, Andy Linighan, the steadiest of Oxford's defenders, attempted a volleyed clearance that fell at Rougier's feet. The goal was a gift and elevated Reading to the top of the table, above Walsall and Brett Angell. But it was probably not quite divine.",

      "body": "<p>Stan Collymore may have frequented more last-chance saloons than Wyatt Earp but after yesterday maybe, just maybe, the nomadic centre-forward should not be perceived as a cowboy after all. </p> <p>With patience running out at Valley Parade, Collymore did his best to earn Chris Hutchings a stay of execution here with the type of goal that, before the tantrums, the Priory clinic and everything else that has sullied his career, was once regarded as his forte.</p> <p>Collymore being Collymore, things have a habit of going awry, of course. His manic celebrations in front of the Leeds supporters will not have gone down well with the powers that be at Lancaster Gate. But, of more consequence to his new employers, just as his acrobatic goal seemed destined to secure their first victory since beating Chelsea on August 22, a rare win bonus was denied them by Mark Viduka's equaliser 11 minutes from time. The wait goes on. </p> <p>Even so, Collymore's goal and a return to the old-fashioned Bradford ways of rolled-up sleeves and perspiration should allow Hutchings not to break out in a cold sweat every time his telephone rings over the next few days. </p> <p>Judging by the comments of Geoffrey Richmond last week, had Bradford lost this soggy Yorkshire derby it would have been difficult to envisage any other situation than Hutchings being removed from office by his trigger-happy chairman. As it was, he can breathe a little easier, for now at least. </p> <p>\"It has been a long week but that performance says it all,\" said Hutchings. \"It was a great team display. The players gave everything for Bradford and everything for me and Stan was fantastic. All he wants to do is concentrate on his football, forget about everything else and do his best for this club.\" </p> <p>Collymore's signing may have carried more than a hint of desperation given the inevitable baggage he brings with him but those who believe his partnership with Benito Carbone will be to a relegation fight what Pepsi and Shirley were to popular music will have a good portion of humble pie facing them this morning. </p> <p>Initially Collymore looked out of shape and Carbone out of luck but when they finally connected after 20 minutes the end product was exemplary, the timing exquisite. </p> <p>Carbone can claim an assist with his right-wing cross but the ball was still falling behind Collymore when he contorted his body and produced an overhead kick of stunning power and precision into the bottom corner of Paul Robinson's net.

      "bodyText": "Stan Collymore may have frequented more last-chance saloons than Wyatt Earp but after yesterday maybe, just maybe, the nomadic centre-forward should not be perceived as a cowboy after all. With patience running out at Valley Parade, Collymore did his best to earn Chris Hutchings a stay of execution here with the type of goal that, before the tantrums, the Priory clinic and everything else that has sullied his career, was once regarded as his forte. Collymore being Collymore, things have a habit of going awry, of course. His manic celebrations in front of the Leeds supporters will not have gone down well with the powers that be at Lancaster Gate. But, of more consequence to his new employers, just as his acrobatic goal seemed destined to secure their first victory since beating Chelsea on August 22, a rare win bonus was denied them by Mark Viduka's equaliser 11 minutes from time. The wait goes on. Even so, Collymore's goal and a return to the old-fashioned Bradford ways of rolled-up sleeves and perspiration should allow Hutchings not to break out in a cold sweat every time his telephone rings over the next few days. Judging by the comments of Geoffrey Richmond last week, had Bradford lost this soggy Yorkshire derby it would have been difficult to envisage any other situation than Hutchings being removed from office by his trigger-happy chairman. As it was, he can breathe a little easier, for now at least. \"It has been a long week but that performance says it all,\" said Hutchings. \"It was a great team display. The players gave everything for Bradford and everything for me and Stan was fantastic. All he wants to do is concentrate on his football, forget about everything else and do his best for this club.\" Collymore's signing may have carried more than a hint of desperation given the inevitable baggage he brings with him but those who believe his partnership with Benito Carbone will be to a relegation fight what Pepsi and Shirley were to popular music will have a good portion of humble pie facing them this morning. Initially Collymore looked out of shape and Carbone out of luck but when they finally connected after 20 minutes the end product was exemplary, the timing exquisite. Carbone can claim an assist with his right-wing cross but the ball was still falling behind Collymore when he contorted his body and produced an overhead kick of stunning power and precision into the bottom corner of Paul Robinson's net. Few would have had the audacity to try such a shot, even fewer would have pulled it off. \"It was a fantastic goal,\" said Hutchings. \"Stan's missed a lot of training over the last few weeks so it was a gamble to play him but he gave me everything he'd got. I had to take him off after 70 minutes because he was knackered but in that time he showed what a great player he can be.\" Quite why Collymore decided to stain the moment by crudely baiting Leeds's travelling fans is another matter entirely. \"I think he was just delighted with the goal,\" mumbled Hutchings, his explanation as watery as the Valley Parade pitch. The FA's compliance officer Graham Bean was among the crowd and, even though the referee Stephen Lodge took no action, Collymore's mail this week is likely to include an invitation from Lancaster Gate to explain his actions. They certainly have his address. That Bradford preserved their lead for so long owed much to their goalkeeper Matt Clarke who was in defiant form all afternoon along with Ian Nolan who, twice in the first half, dug out goal-line clearances to deny Danny Hay and Dominic Matteo. Leeds had finished the opening period showing signs that they were adapting better to the rainy conditions and the second half was a story of almost unremitting pressure from O'Leary's depleted team. Collymore continued to be a threat until being withdrawn but Bradford's attacks were becoming few and far between and such was the level of activity around the Bradford penalty area there was an air of inevitability about Viduka's equaliser, the Australian striker jumping unchallenged to clip a neat header beyond Clarke from Matteo's cross. An indignant O'Leary also claimed that Leeds should have had a penalty when Alan Smith was felled by Peter Atherton although television pictures showed the Bradford defender got the slightest of touches on the ball. As it is, Bradford remain second from bottom while Leeds are now nine points adrift of Manchester United and Arsenal. \"I'm not a genius and my players are not rocket scientists,\" said O'Leary. \"We've been devastated by injuries and there was no way we could keep up with the two biggest and best clubs around. We just have to dig in and hopefully when we have players coming back at Christmas we won't be too far off.\"",

In the draw for the first round, the Second Division strugglers Luton face a tricky tie against Rushden &amp; Diamonds, who are second in the Conference, the leaders of which, Yeovil, will play Colchester if they get past Horsham. Japan won the Asian Cup yesterday by beating the defending champions Saudi Arabia, who included the Wolves striker Sami al-Jaber, 1-0 with a goal from Shigeyoshi Mochizuki.",

'There's your effing ball,' he said and marched off.\" </p> <p>That was what happened when Sir Alex Ferguson tried to deny Steve Archibald the match ball after a hat-trick in his days at Aberdeen. Should he try to do the same to Teddy Sheringham then he had better get his pen out for an update of Managing My Life: My Autobiography, for this is a 34-year-old striker with a burning point to prove. Six months ago it seemed that Sheringham was out the door. Manchester United were willing to pay \u00a319m for the young PSV Eindhoven striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and Sheringham was the man to make way.</p> <p>How quickly things have changed. Van Nistelrooy's knee collapsed, Sheringham signed a new one-year deal worth \u00a31.2m, and now the talk is not just of a contract extension but even a place in England's starting line-up for the match against Italy on November 15. \"He's arguably in the greatest form of his career,\" Mark Lawrenson said on Match of the Day. </p> <p>Glenn Hoddle had no doubts. \"He still has a lot to offer his club and his country,\" the Southampton manager emphasised, and as if to confirm his opinion, the cameras later picked out Steve McClaren, the United and now England coach, making studious notes on the sidelines. </p> <p>Hoddle, a former England coach himself, suggested that not only was Sheringham in top form, he was in fact getting better because, first, he had never depended on pace, and, second, he was gathering greater experience.</p> <p>\"A player who relies on pace may not be able to play at this level at his age but as he never relied on his pace it means he is still as good as ever,\" he said. \"I played until I was 38 and a set of curtains opens in your mind when you are older and you begin to read the game better.\" </p> <p>Having displaced Dwight Yorke at United as the partner for Andy Cole, Sheringham - with nine goals now in United's 11 league games - was already in the running for a new contract. </p> <p>\"I don't see why we can't do it,\" Ferguson said. \"His new contract has given him some assurance that he's wanted here. He made the point that he's not been the No1 choice over the years but he's started the season well and he's never looked back.\" Admittedly, an easily cowed Southampton were never going to be the greatest test of a striker's ability, but Sheringham was able to demonstrate that the guile, skill, timing and positional sense needed to unlock international defences were well within his repertoire, as was the necessary understanding with England's current main striker Cole. </p> <p>After Cole had softened up the visitors with a shot that squirmed through the hands of Paul Jones in an odd reprise of Massimo Taibi's howler in this fixture last season, Sheringham set his mind to the task in hand. </p> <p>His first goal was typically intelligent, a Cantona-like chip over the goalkeeper from the left of the area. The second was a wafted shot into the top corner of the net and the third saw him arrive with perfect timing to whip the ball off Cole's feet and into Jones' bottom left-hand corner. </p> <p>\"That is my first hat-trick for Man United and hopefully I can get some more,\" he said. \"Things are going well. We're top of the league, winning games and a couple of goals are going in as well, so things are fine.\"</p> <p>Cole's header then rounded things off and the warm congratulations from his partner suggested that the icy relationship between them was at least thawing.</p> <p>Ferguson added a decent touch of his own by substituting the pair in the 74th minute, allowing them both a standing ovation.</p>",

Six months ago it seemed that Sheringham was out the door. Manchester United were willing to pay \u00a319m for the young PSV Eindhoven striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and Sheringham was the man to make way. How quickly things have changed. Van Nistelrooy's knee collapsed, Sheringham signed a new one-year deal worth \u00a31.2m, and now the talk is not just of a contract extension but even a place in England's starting line-up for the match against Italy on November 15. \"He's arguably in the greatest form of his career,\" Mark Lawrenson said on Match of the Day. Glenn Hoddle had no doubts. \"He still has a lot to offer his club and his country,\" the Southampton manager emphasised, and as if to confirm his opinion, the cameras later picked out Steve McClaren, the United and now England coach, making studious notes on the sidelines. Hoddle, a former England coach himself, suggested that not only was Sheringham in top form, he was in fact getting better because, first, he had never depended on pace, and, second, he was gathering greater experience. \"A player who relies on pace may not be able to play at this level at his age but as he never relied on his pace it means he is still as good as ever,\" he said. \"I played until I was 38 and a set of curtains opens in your mind when you are older and you begin to read the game better.\" Having displaced Dwight Yorke at United as the partner for Andy Cole, Sheringham - with nine goals now in United's 11 league games - was already in the running for a new contract. \"I don't see why we can't do it,\" Ferguson said. \"His new contract has given him some assurance that he's wanted here. He made the point that he's not been the No1 choice over the years but he's started the season well and he's never looked back.\" Admittedly, an easily cowed Southampton were never going to be the greatest test of a striker's ability, but Sheringham was able to demonstrate that the guile, skill, timing and positional sense needed to unlock international defences were well within his repertoire, as was the necessary understanding with England's current main striker Cole. After Cole had softened up the visitors with a shot that squirmed through the hands of Paul Jones in an odd reprise of Massimo Taibi's howler in this fixture last season, Sheringham set his mind to the task in hand. His first goal was typically intelligent, a Cantona-like chip over the goalkeeper from the left of the area. The second was a wafted shot into the top corner of the net and the third saw him arrive with perfect timing to whip the ball off Cole's feet and into Jones' bottom left-hand corner. \"That is my first hat-trick for Man United and hopefully I can get some more,\" he said. \"Things are going well. We're top of the league, winning games and a couple of goals are going in as well, so things are fine.\" Cole's header then rounded things off and the warm congratulations from his partner suggested that the icy relationship between them was at least thawing. Ferguson added a decent touch of his own by substituting the pair in the 74th minute, allowing them both a standing ovation.",

      "body": "<p>It's dubbed the ministry of fun, and if you believe the papers, Tory culture spokesman Peter Ainsworth is a fun kind of guy. He smoked dope at college, so he can't be all bad. And shadowing Chris Smith in parliament is hardly a tough task - the culture secretary has not exactly covered himself in glory recently. It would be hard to cock it up. \"It is one of the best portfolios,\" admits Ainsworth with a smile.</p> <p>It is not, however, easy to take a Tory culture spokesman seriously. In government, the Conservatives' broadcasting legacy was the discredited auction system that turned ITV into a free-for-all for the highest bidder. Successive national heritage secretaries were lambasted for being ineffectual (think Stephen Dorrell and Virginia Bottomley). And the Broadcasting Standards Commission, set up as a sop to the right-wing clean-up campaigners, has turned out to be a toothless tiger. Arts groups remember the Tories for slashing arts spending - even though it was the Conservative government that set up the national lottery. The one consolation is that the Tories at least enjoy plenty of friends in the press.</p> <p>So when Ainsworth was appointed to the brief after the last election, he had a hard task ahead of him. He could have just made a name for himself by providing handy quotes to the Daily Mail when it gets outraged about Channel 5 (and he has done his fair share of that), and wait until something better comes along.</p> <p>But, instead, Ainsworth has quietly been doing the rounds of the media circles. He is known to all the major broadcasters and lunches newspaper editors. He has immersed himself in all the issues that concern his wide brief (today the \"historic environment\" is at the front of his mind, following a meeting with English Heritage), and by all accounts, he has taken on board what people have said. Yet until the Mail on Sunday outed a crop of Tory frontbenchers as having tried cannabis in their youth, there was nothing much more to say about him.</p> <p>But with a white paper imminent, it is important for the Tories to be seen to have a thought-out communications policy. It's not enough just to moan about the BBC, you've got to have a view about what to do about it.</p> <p>And at least he watches TV and reads the papers. (There's a photocopy of the Sun's mocking front page the day after Greg Dyke was appointed to the BBC on his wall.) He enthuses about My Family, the BBC sitcom that has debuted to mixed reviews (\"very high-quality comedy\"), Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? (\"great theatre\"), and, of course: \"I became addicted to Big Brother. And yes, I voted.\" So did he go for Scouse builder Craig, or lesbian former nun Anna? \"I was one of the 49%.\" An Anna man, then.</p> <p>So that takes care of BBC, ITV and Channel 4. What about Channel 5, which he condemned as \"gross\" in the Mail earlier this year after it exposed Keith Chegwin's bodily parts to an undeserving public? He makes the right noises about protecting children, but adds: \"Well, you can switch it off. You don't have to watch it.\"</p> <p>Suddenly, he swaps his smooth Oxford-educated received pronunciation for a mock-south London accent to imitate a constituent who complained about the channel. \"He said to me, 'It's absolute filth innit, it goes on all night.' I replied, 'You don't have to watch it, there is the off button. And he said, 'Funnily enough, that's what my wife says.'\" Clearly Ainsworth isn't that concerned about Channel Filth.</p> <p>He is far more exercised with the BBC. It's not surprising: for the Conservatives, the corporation has always been a handy whipping boy. Full of pinko liberal subversives, it was a corrosive source of counter-revolutionary thought that had to be stamped on at all costs. The arrival of Dyke as director-general appeared to confirm that view. William Hague demanded that his appointment be blocked, and cries of \"Labour stooge\" went up as soon as he was confirmed in the post. Now, however, Dyke presents something of a problem for politicians of the right. In moving the Nine o'Clock News to 10pm with such haste, he has incurred the wrath of Smith. In slashing management costs, he has shown himself to be a shrewd businessman. And in showing a determination to increase the BBC's revenue from external sources, he has displayed a commercial eye that was lacking in the previous regime.</p> <p>Hence, a marked change in tune from the Tories. \"Greg is a highly commercial individual,\" says Ainsworth. \"To his core he is a commercial operator. That has merits. It's a breath of fresh air, a management style that's welcomed. He's an engaging guy, all that is good. What gives some cause for concern is that there is a degree of impetuousness which we saw with the sudden decision to bring forward the move of the news. That was a highly commercial thing to do.\"</p> <p>But Ainsworth doubts whether the commercialism of Dyke is necessarily a good thing for the corporation. \"Is there going to be a culture clash between the BBC as an institution and a man who is so entrepreneurial?\"</p> <p>So far, so reasonable. Many in the BBC would say the same thing. But lest we be in any doubt, Ainsworth calls back later after thinking about what he has said. Dyke is still very much on probation as far as his political bias is concerned. \"We are watching him like hawks. It's not an issue that can simply be brushed aside. I wouldn't want to give the impression that I think everything is rosy in the garden.\"</p> <p>During his interview, in his cramped offices at Millbank, he expresses serious concerns about the ratings-driven strategy that appears to have been adopted by Dyke, Mark Thompson and Lorraine Heggessey at the BBC. While he acknowledges that BBC1 must continue to be popular if the argument for the licence fee (which he supports) is to be sustained, he believes that the corporation has over-stepped the mark. Moving the news was \"opportunistic\". And it calls into question the role of the BBC governors, and the whole way in which the BBC - and the rest of the broadcasting industry - is regulated.</p> <p>While he says that \"any new parliamentary measures should be as profoundly deregulatory as humanly possible\", he agrees with the commercial sector's argument that the corporation should be brought under an overarching broadcasting regulator. The BBC governors cannot be \"judge and jury\" any more. But he does not advocate their abolition: \"There is plenty for them to do.\" Instead, they would play the role of \"non-executive directors\".</p> <p>It is unfair, he says, that ITV should have had to jump through so many hoops when it wanted to move News at Ten, when the BBC could do it in a matter of weeks without reference to an independent body. And it is equally unfair that those who wish to complain about the BBC's actions are also referred to the governors, who are ultimately responsible for the decisions in the first place.</p> <p>But he is a supporter of the licence fee \"for the time being\", and would not countenance allowing advertising onto the BBC. \"It would be devastating for the commercial sector.\"</p> <p>And even in the light of the News of the World's dispatch of the Broadcasting Standards Commission's hapless Lord Holme, he does not favour a privacy law.

The Ulster Democratic party, the UDA's political wing, blamed the killing on the rival Ulster Volunteer Force.",

The shadow chancellor promised that a Conservative government would offer \u00a38bn worth of tax cuts if they win the next general election. Writing in the Times, Mr Portillo denies Labour accusations that a future Tory government would cut \u00a316bn from funding of public services. He said that Labour's calculations \"have no basis in reality\" - and claims tax cuts could come alongside increases in on services. \"Some people seem to find it hard to understand that we can offer increases in public spending but reduce taxes,\" writes Mr Portillo. \"It is economic growth that makes this possible.\" He added: \"If we were to commit ourselves to raise public spending by \u00a360bn instead of Mr [Chancellor Gordon Brown] Brown's \u00a368bn, and to make \u00a38bn of tax cuts, we would, without any effect on debt, still be committed to a huge programme of spending that would easily encompass our commitment to match Labour's planned spending on the NHS.\" Meanwhile the chancellor, Gordon Brown, was expected to unveil a range of new financial incentives aimed at 350,000 more lone parents into work He is expected to announce that he wants to increase the proportion of lone parents at work from 50% to the US level of 70% through training grants and extra help with childcare and housing costs Both initiatives mark out the re-emergence of the tax and spend policies as one of the key battlegrounds of the next election. Mr Portillo promises \"more details\" in the coming months. A Labour spokesman said: \"Michael Portillo has admitted that the Tories would make substantial spending cuts - but he still won't tell us where the cuts will fall. \"What we do know is that he is making no commitment to match Labour's spending plans for education, transport and policing, and that money will be diverted from the NHS to private health care. \"The Tory sums don't add up. Vital public services - schools, transport and policing - would all be cut under Tory plans.\" Later today, Mr Portillo stressed that he was not dealing with exact figures at this stage. \"I'm not committing myself to a particular figure. \"But I think it's important for people to understand that it is perfectly possible, with the economy growing, for us spend much more money on public services - including all the sums of money which the government wishes to spend on the health service - and still have room for tax cuts. \"It clearly is possible. This is a matter of choices, and you can have higher public spending, much higher public spending, and still have tax cuts.\" Mr Portillo said that he would not be able to \"unpick\" the present government's spending plans for next year if the Tories were to win a May general election. \"We could only thereafter, I think, get down to increases which were sustainable in the long term,\" he BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",

For once the worn brown corduroys, hiking boots and Indiana Jones hat were replaced by a suit for dinner. </p> <p>Stahl, 45, is a freelance cameraman. One of a breed who, when the going gets dangerously tough - in such places as Chechnya, East Timor and Kosovo - provide the only pictures we get of whatever contemporary hell they're still in. I've known four Max Stahls over the years - three of whom died. He has been kidnapped twice, seriously wounded twice and reported dead three times. </p> <p>Stahl received the Rory Peck Award (named after a freelance cameraman killed in Moscow in 1993) on Thursday night for what may have been one of the most important pieces of television footage in the past decade. He arrived in East Timor as the results of the country's UN-sponsored first democratic elec tion were about to be announced in September 1999. Defying the Indonesian army by island-hopping on hired fishing boats, he got there just in time to record the fury and revenge unleashed by the army and militia in the wake of the elections. The people of East Timor, encouraged and supported by the UN, had dared to declare independence. The result was a bloody backlash and orders from New York for the UN staff to get out fast. Media teams were leaving as well. Within hours of the election result, some 600 journalists had been reduced to a handful, mainly freelancers, numbering around 20. </p> <p>The three satellite dishes owned by the major news organisation were packed up, so any cameraman left behind had to ship out his pictures by hand. Stahl was in the UN compound in Dili when the people sheltering there heard they were to be abandoned. Stahl, Marie Colvin of the Sunday Times and two Dutch journalists were the only media personnel who stayed behind. The other 600, including myself, were left baying in Darwin. If ever a story needed to be covered by the international media it was East Timor - but we were all gone. Crucially, because he was the only cameraman there, Stahl stayed. </p> <p>The reality of TV journalism today is that it is a soap opera, complete with star faces. A correspondent is in one country on a Monday and then a different war in a different country on a Wednesday. When things get really tough, the pictures usually come from the freelancers. \"The TV companies treat it like stacking supermarket shelves - they have to fill the shelf, but they don't want to pay out the big money for insurance, or to put their own people at risk, so they do it in other ways by using people like us,\" says Stahl. </p> <p>\"You never get the money or time upfront from TV companies - maybe you can get an aid agency to give you some help, but the backing is not there from the big corporations. The only way to do real investigative journalism for TV now is to step outside of the system - inside they don't even know what you are talking about any more. They don't see that their own soap opera of star correspondents is delivering nothing of any real substance because they are too busy hopping from one country to another.\" </p> <p>Stahl has been interested in Timor for 20 years, and has covered earlier massacres, so he had both the contacts and the commitment to stay on when the UN abandoned the people in its compound. He wrote afterwards: \"Informed only hours before the planned pullout, and fearing immediate death, hundreds of refugees fled under the wire and up the steep rocky hill behind a cover of darkness . . . I joined them with a small infrared-capable DV camera.\" </p> <p>Stahl's pictures of women and children stumbling up the hill in the darkness, faces frozen in shock and fear, were the only images of the Timor tragedy. They were played again and again around the world. </p> <p>According to one of the judges of Rory Peck Award, Stahl's pictures had a huge political influence. \"It was very important material in terms of its impact on the UN Security Council - these pictures shocked them and forced them to act.\" </p> <p>Nik Gowing, a BBC World presenter and former diplomatic editor of Channel 4 News, says: \"To stay in Dili when everyone else had left, and to go outside the UN compound to tell the whole story was very brave indeed . . . to leave it and spend time with the people in the hills is fabulous.\" </p> <p>Stahl undoubtedly saved lives, but his pictures also helped force the hand of the UN into direct intervention in East Timor - finally burying its shattering failure in Somalia and giving it the confidence to support difficult peace missions in countries such as Sierre Leone. </p> <p>Earlier this year, another freelance cameraman - the 1998 winner of the Rory Peck Award, Miguel Gil Moreno - was killed in Sierre Leone. Before his death, his last major trip had been to Chechnya, where he spent three weeks. His pictures of human beings living like terrified rats under the city were - like Stahl's Timor pictures - the only show in town. </p> <p>So hundreds of TV companies around the world depended on two men - freelancers who funded themselves - to bring the biggest international stories of the year into our living rooms. It was the same in Kosovo: the only pictures that made it out came from three freelance cameramen who crawled through Serb positions during the bombing. </p> <p>Yet the media industry treats these heroes like the most irritating of door-to-door salesmen. Vaughan Smith, who runs Frontline News - co-founded by Rory Peck - says freelancers such as Stahl and Moreno are in danger of becoming extinct. Their market has been taken over by news agencies such as AP and Reuters, who pay locals to supply footage. In Grozny last year another small agency was giving teenagers $400 to go onto the streets to gather pictures - a Russian roulette for television. In a survey of six past winners of the Rory Peck Award, Smith found that most said the major TV companies were exploiting them. </p> <p>A Russian cameraman who died in Chechnya left behind a widow and family who did not receive a penny in compensation because the small Russian TV station he worked for folded. The Rory Peck Fund is helping to support his family. \"It's a lottery, and who you are working for dictates how you are treated,\" says Tina Carr, who runs the fund. \"One man dies and his family get nothing. Gil Moreno was working for AP when he died, so there was some back-up.\" </p> <p>According to Smith, the TV companies are becoming less and less receptive to the most valuable and often the most daring of the news-gatherers. \"Restructuring seems to have made broadcasting corporations less flexible and, with a few notable exceptions such as the Channel 4 Independence Fund, they seem less receptive. When they do need us we outlive our usefulness the day the story ends.\" </p> <p>Many freelancers are forced to fund their own trips. One I know returned from Chechnya and got on the phone to the BBC at Heathrow. At that time, in December 1999, it was virtually impossible to get inside the country. He had escaped kidnapping and attack by helicopter gunship and returned with pictures of refugees being bombed by Russian helicopters, and rare footage of fundamentalist fighters in action. </p> <p> First the desk editor said he was too busy to talk, asked him to call back, and when he did said: \"We already have someone there.\" The BBC team, like thousands of other media personnel, was then unable to get past the Russians into Chechnya - yet this freelancer could hardly get anyone to take his calls. </p> <p>Warning against using non-professionals, Smith points to a phenomenon that was already exemplified by the teenage image-hunters in Grozny. \"Some of them will do brilliantly, but they will be vulnerable and there will be a tendency towards a kind of war porn and pictures un-associated with journalistic investigation.\" </p> <p>In May, the death in an ambush of Moreno and Kurt Schork, an American war correspondent, rocked the industry. Experience was no protection. News chiefs have become more and more cautious - rightly trying to protect their people.

They won promotion four years ago, qualified for the Champions League last year and advanced from the same group as Chelsea to the second group stage. They showed resilience on Sunday, holding out in Munich with the considerable help of their Hungarian goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly, then stealing victory in the second minute of injury time when their Icelandic defender Eyjoelfur Sverrisson headed in a free-kick from Stefan Beinlich, the former Aston Villa midfielder. \"It was a lucky victory,\" said Sverrisson. \"We executed our concept terribly.\" Hertha took over at the top from Bayern Munich, who drew 1-1 in Bremen on Saturday. In other Bundesliga action over the weekend, Cologne climbed off the bottom with a 3-2 win over VfB Stuttgart, Unterhaching came back from a goal down to upset Hamburg 2-1 and Kaiserslautern gained their third successive victory under their new coach Andreas Brehme, 2-1 at Borussia Dortmund. But Rudi Voller, the new coach at Bayer Leverkusen, failed to gain a third successive victory. Bayer held on for a 0-0 draw in Gelsenkirchen against Schalke 04. Voller's predecessor, Christoph Daum, is hiding out in Orlando, protesting his innocence and apparently contemplating taking another drugs test today.\"Christoph believes that some powerful people manipulated his hair analysis. He doesn't trust anyone,\" said Reiner Calmund, Leverkusen's general manager. \"This thing isn't over,\" Daum told Bild am Sonntag. \"I have my tactics. I'll be there at high noon.\" Daum was fired by Leverkusen and dropped as Germany's future national coach after he failed the hair analysis test designed to disprove Bild's claim that he was in the habit of holding cocaine-fuelled sex parties with prostitutes. Police with sniffer dogs searched Daum's home and office on Friday. While the Bundesliga and most other European leagues are only just beginning to take shape, the season is nearly at an end in more northerly countries. Sunday was cup final day in Norway. And Odd Grenland lifted the trophy for the first time since 1931 after extra-time at the Ulleval. The Danish substitute Christian Flindt Bjerg scored from close range to give the Odd boys a 2-1 win over Viking Stavanger. Halmstad clinched their second Swedish League title in four years with a 2-0 win over Elfsborg in Boras. That stretched their lead over AIK Solna, the defending champions, to eight points with only one game to go. Spartak Moscow look certain to win the Russian title for the fifth successive year after a 2-1 win over Zenit in St Petersburg. Artyom Bezrodny scored a dramatic winner late in injury time to give Spartak a five-point lead over their Muscovite rivals Lokomotiv with two matches remaining. Elsewhere in Europe ... Feyenoord lost their 100% record in the Netherlands when they were held 1-1 by Utrecht. Club Brugge maintained their 100% record in Belgium with a 2-0 win at Westerlo. Paris St-Germain went down to their first home defeat of the season when Bordeaux overcame the loss of their French international striker Christophe Dugarry to win 2-1 at the Parc des Princes with two goals from their Portuguese international forward Pauleta. And in Portugal, Sporting Lisbon ended a run of three successive defeats with a 1-0 over Beira Mar.",

      "body": "<p>It's been an emotional week in Spain: Gaizka Mendieta abused 40,000 Valencian mothers, Steve McManaman became the object of a love-in at the Bernab\u00e9u (again), an angry Javier Clemente was sacked - and the fall-out from the Barcelona v Madrid derbi continued.</p> <p>Following the abuse Luis Figo received last week, Portugal pulled out of a friendly against the Catalan national side in protest, and Barcelona were fined a less-than-crippling 1.5m pesetas (under \u00a36,000) by the Spanish FA for the behaviour of their fans. Meanwhile Roberto Carlos revealed that he had been scared of \"not getting home alive\" - words which were to prove horribly prophetic. </p> <p>On Tuesday an already emotional night in Leeds led to tragedy when a Barcelona supporter was shot dead in the small town of Chinchilla by 57-year-old Real Madrid fan Manuel Gabald\u00f3n. The madridista took to the streets with a box of fireworks to celebrate his rivals' defeat at Elland Road. Or so he thought. When Bar\u00e7a fan and local baker Francisco Javier Jim\u00e9nez kindly revealed that Rivaldo had saved the day a huge argument blew up. Gabald\u00f3n returned home, collected his hunting rifle and returned to settle the dispute. The Madrid fan has been described by locals as a \"conflictive personality\" (ie. a nutter) and the town's mayor confirmed that the two had been \"involved in fights before\". Even so, no one foresaw such a terrible end. </p> <p>Emotions have also been running high in Valencia. Mendieta has been far from happy, as he showed with his tetchy response to scoring the winner against Zaragoza last week. Abused by a section of his own fans, Valencia's captain barely celebrated the strike. Instead an indignant \"hijos de puta\" (sons of bitches) was clearly visible to anyone with the most elementary of lip-reading skills. </p> <p>Then on Wednesday the club acted to avoid similar scenes to those witnessed at the Camp Nou by leaving the former Olympiakos midfielder Zlatko Zahovic out of their squad for the trip to Athens. It was probably a wise move: messages left on Zahovic's website declaring that \"the Slovenians will have to come to Athens to collect the bones of their idol\" hardly boded well. </p> <p>Perhaps temperatures within the Valencia squad had cooled down too much by Sunday, as over in Pamplona H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper's side were unable to muster up any passion against newly promoted Osasuna. The league leaders fell behind to a Mateo strike inside six minutes, but got out of jail when Cruchaga scored an own goal 12 minutes later. Valencia managed only one shot on target in the whole of the second half and victory hardly looked on the cards, until John Carew scored with just five minutes remaining to keep them top of the Liga. </p> <p>Emotions were also running high in San Sebasti\u00e1n, where Javier Clemente was sacked as manager of Real Sociedad on Monday. Never one to smile when a frown will do, the ex-national coach was adamant that the blame lay with press, players and fans. Oh, and there was a sinister plot against him, too: \"I'm not the problem,\" Clemente claimed. \"Someone [at the club] was interested in creating a bad atmosphere\". Like Spanish supporters after the 98 World Cup, Real fans won't exactly be sorry to see him go. </p> <p>But Clemente's departure didn't help the struggling Sociedad side. This weekend it was Real Madrid's turn to fill their boots in San Sebasti\u00e1n - just what their caretaker boss Salva Iriarte needed. Madrid - whose fans gave rapturous receptions to returning heroes Morientes and McManaman (long time, no see) at the Bernab\u00e9u in midweek - ran out comfortable winners. Guti and Savio were the key men, grabbing one each in a 4-1 victory. Figo and Hierro completed the scoring in a game all too easy for Madrid. So easy, in fact, that the Spanish league's worst player, Geremi, even managed to hit the post from Figo's corner. Nice to see uncle Vicente is letting him take them again. </p> <p>Rivaldo, another player not entirely happy with life, was even more downcast on Saturday night. Barcelona were totally outclassed during their visit to Mallorca, where their defence was torn apart by Samuel Eto'o and Alberto Luque. That said, even the Neville brothers would have fancied their chances against the goalkeeper Dutruel and defender Sergi, who combined hilariously to gift the islanders both goals in a 2-0 win.

      "bodyText": "It's been an emotional week in Spain: Gaizka Mendieta abused 40,000 Valencian mothers, Steve McManaman became the object of a love-in at the Bernab\u00e9u (again), an angry Javier Clemente was sacked - and the fall-out from the Barcelona v Madrid derbi continued. Following the abuse Luis Figo received last week, Portugal pulled out of a friendly against the Catalan national side in protest, and Barcelona were fined a less-than-crippling 1.5m pesetas (under \u00a36,000) by the Spanish FA for the behaviour of their fans. Meanwhile Roberto Carlos revealed that he had been scared of \"not getting home alive\" - words which were to prove horribly prophetic. On Tuesday an already emotional night in Leeds led to tragedy when a Barcelona supporter was shot dead in the small town of Chinchilla by 57-year-old Real Madrid fan Manuel Gabald\u00f3n. The madridista took to the streets with a box of fireworks to celebrate his rivals' defeat at Elland Road. Or so he thought. When Bar\u00e7a fan and local baker Francisco Javier Jim\u00e9nez kindly revealed that Rivaldo had saved the day a huge argument blew up. Gabald\u00f3n returned home, collected his hunting rifle and returned to settle the dispute. The Madrid fan has been described by locals as a \"conflictive personality\" (ie. a nutter) and the town's mayor confirmed that the two had been \"involved in fights before\". Even so, no one foresaw such a terrible end. Emotions have also been running high in Valencia. Mendieta has been far from happy, as he showed with his tetchy response to scoring the winner against Zaragoza last week. Abused by a section of his own fans, Valencia's captain barely celebrated the strike. Instead an indignant \"hijos de puta\" (sons of bitches) was clearly visible to anyone with the most elementary of lip-reading skills. Then on Wednesday the club acted to avoid similar scenes to those witnessed at the Camp Nou by leaving the former Olympiakos midfielder Zlatko Zahovic out of their squad for the trip to Athens. It was probably a wise move: messages left on Zahovic's website declaring that \"the Slovenians will have to come to Athens to collect the bones of their idol\" hardly boded well. Perhaps temperatures within the Valencia squad had cooled down too much by Sunday, as over in Pamplona H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper's side were unable to muster up any passion against newly promoted Osasuna. The league leaders fell behind to a Mateo strike inside six minutes, but got out of jail when Cruchaga scored an own goal 12 minutes later. Valencia managed only one shot on target in the whole of the second half and victory hardly looked on the cards, until John Carew scored with just five minutes remaining to keep them top of the Liga. Emotions were also running high in San Sebasti\u00e1n, where Javier Clemente was sacked as manager of Real Sociedad on Monday. Never one to smile when a frown will do, the ex-national coach was adamant that the blame lay with press, players and fans. Oh, and there was a sinister plot against him, too: \"I'm not the problem,\" Clemente claimed. \"Someone [at the club] was interested in creating a bad atmosphere\". Like Spanish supporters after the 98 World Cup, Real fans won't exactly be sorry to see him go. But Clemente's departure didn't help the struggling Sociedad side. This weekend it was Real Madrid's turn to fill their boots in San Sebasti\u00e1n - just what their caretaker boss Salva Iriarte needed. Madrid - whose fans gave rapturous receptions to returning heroes Morientes and McManaman (long time, no see) at the Bernab\u00e9u in midweek - ran out comfortable winners. Guti and Savio were the key men, grabbing one each in a 4-1 victory. Figo and Hierro completed the scoring in a game all too easy for Madrid. So easy, in fact, that the Spanish league's worst player, Geremi, even managed to hit the post from Figo's corner. Nice to see uncle Vicente is letting him take them again. Rivaldo, another player not entirely happy with life, was even more downcast on Saturday night. Barcelona were totally outclassed during their visit to Mallorca, where their defence was torn apart by Samuel Eto'o and Alberto Luque. That said, even the Neville brothers would have fancied their chances against the goalkeeper Dutruel and defender Sergi, who combined hilariously to gift the islanders both goals in a 2-0 win. Twice Dutruel failed to hold pretty tame efforts from Luque. Twice Sergi stood and watched. And twice Mallorca punished them, Eto'o finishing off the first and Ibagaza the second. Dutruel, the latest in a long line of dreadful Camp Nou keepers, scandalously claimed afterwards that he \"didn't feel guilty\". That classic symbol of Spanish discontent - the hanky wave (\"pa\u00f1olada\") - was the order of the day in Soria, where Numancia hosted Deportivo La Coruna. The referee Daud\u00e9n Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez was the object of the Numancia fans' wrath, failing to award a penalty in the 93rd minute after a clear foul by the Deportivo defender Helder.

Rayo Vallecano missed the chance to stay ahead of their city rivals Real Madrid, losing at home to last year's surprise package Alav\u00e9s. The Vitoria side look set to defy the odds once again - they lie third. Finally, a little quiz for the medical staff at Rangers. Who was this weekend's goalscoring man of the match when Espanyol pulled themselves out of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win over Oviedo? Here's a little clue, boys - \"if he plays again he could wreck his whole career\".",

NEWS IN BRIEF Arsenal's George Graham, manager of Tottenham, has been given a vote of confidence by Sir Alan Sugar, despite Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Chelsea. \"George Graham's past history makes him one of the best managers in the Premier League,\" said Sugar. \"We are building for the future and must take a patient and cautious approach. There is no question of George Graham being asked to leave Tottenham.\" Milan will not face any punishment after playing Brazilian goalkeeper Nelson Dida in Big Cup this season. A Uefa spokesman said: \"The player was registered as a Brazilian player for Uefa competitions. If there is any debate as to his citizenship, that is a matter for the Italian authorities.\" Paraguayan international goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert is set to sign for struggling French first division side Strasbourg for \u00a31.5m.

      "body": "<p> <strong>Pakistan innings</strong></p> <p>Pakistan have won the third one-day international against England at Rawalpindi and with it the series, by two games to one. They reached their target of 159 with more than six overs to spare and for the loss of just four wickets. After their hammering in Karachi, Pakistan have reasserted themselves brilliantly.</p> <p>A careful fourth-wicket stand of 77 in almost 25 overs between Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana came to an end the ball after Youhana had showed some rare aggression, flicking Craig White through square-leg for four. He then heaved wildly, missed and the ball cannoned into the base of off stump. Youhana had made 31 off 90 balls - not usually enough to win a one-day international, but England's batting effort meant Pakistan were never hurried.</p> <p>At 128 for 4, Pakistan were virtually home and dry, and Inzamam moved to his half-century, from 96 deliveries, before Adur Razzaq, whose 75* at Karachi was quickly forgotten after Flintoff's fireworks, launched Andy Caddick over mid-off for four. He creamed the next ball through the covers.</p> <p>Inzamam was badly missed by Ashley Giles at mid-off in the next over and should have been run out with seven needed after a characteristic mix-up, but Pakistan knocked off the remaining runs with ease. Inzamam finished unbeaten on 60, and Razzaq cracked a nine-ball 17.</p> <p>England now have to work out how to play the spinners before the Test series starts in Lahore on November 15.</p> <p> <strong>35-over update</strong></p> <p>Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana had extended their fourth-wicket partnership to 54 after 35 overs of Pakistan's reply to England's 158. At that point Pakistan were 105 for 3, and on course for a comfortable, if dull victory in the one-day series.</p> <p>England's bowlers were doing a good containing job - just 54 runs had come from the previous 20 overs - but Pakistan never needed to score at much more than three an over, and you always felt they would move up a gear if they had to. </p> <p>Mark Ealham (5-0-9-0) took the pace off the ball on a slow pitch that offered turn, while Ashley Giles (8-0-24-1) at least offered some hope for the Test series ahead by finding bounce and maintaining an accurate line. </p> <p>But England were unable to make the breakthrough they needed, and when the 100 came up in the 35th over, a baying crowd was already celebrating. Inzamam brought up the 50 stand by pulling Darren Gough's slower ball over midwicket for four, and England were left needing something special.</p> <p><strong>25-over update</strong></p> <p>Pakistan should go on to win the third one-day international at Rawalpindi - and with it the series - but England's bowlers are making them work hard for the 159 they need. After 25 overs they had crawled to 72 for 3, having scored just 21 runs in their last 10. Inzamam-ul-Haq was not out 24 from 52 balls, while Yousuf Youhana had 6 from 37. </p> <p>The bowlers who put on the brakes were Craig White and Ashley Giles. White made good use of the slower ball to complete an outstanding first spell of 6-2-9-0 - four of those runs came when Inzamam top-edged a slower ball just in front of Alec Stewart and away to the boundary.</p> <p>Giles was almost as parsimonious, and found a good line and length to restrict the batsmen to pushed singles on the legside. Inzamam did crash the final ball of his sixth over to the cover boundary, but Giles's figures still read 6-0-16-1.</p> <p>But for all England's thrift, they still needed wickets. And while Inzamam was still there, Pakistan were red-hot favourites.</p> <p><strong>15-over update</strong></p> <p>Pakistan reached 51 for 3 after 15 overs, and needed a further 108 to clinch the one-day series against England. Andy Caddick took two early wickets to bring England back into the game, and they almost picked up a third when Graeme Hick just failed to cling on to a tough chance, diving to his right at second slip after Darren Gough had found the outside edge of Salim Elahi's bat. That would have made it 17 for 3.</p> <p>Instead Elahi and Inzamam-ul-Haq progressed steadily against some tight bowling. Gough bowled consecutive maidens, and England were outstanding in the field. One stop by Nasser Hussain, diving full stretch at gully to stop a fierce drive from Elahi, was as good as anything Jonty Rhodes could do.</p> <p>Elahi did find the boundary in the 13th over though, following a gorgeous square-drive off Caddick for four with a straight-driven thump two balls later.</p> <p>Hussain threw the ball to Ashley Giles in the 15th over - and England snared their third wicket. The ball after Pakistan had moved to 50, Elahi nibbled at one outside off stump that turned and bounced and Hussain held on at slip to make it 51 for 3. Elahi had made 23 and England were back in it.</p> <p><strong>3-over update</strong></p> <p> Andy Caddick struck twice in two balls to give England an outside chance in the crucial third one-day international against Pakistan at Rawalpindi. With the final ball of his first over he found some extra bounce outside off stump and Imran Nazir could only edge to Graeme Hick who dived to his left at second slip. 0 for 1.</p> <p>Shahid Afridi fought back in the next over, driving and pulling Darren Gough for consecutive boundaries, but he soon became Caddick's second victim. Aiming to drive the first ball of Caddick's second over, he picked out Nasser Hussain at point to make it 9 for 2. </p> <p>Inzamam-ul-Haq survived the hat-trick ball, but England were in with a shout.</p> <p><strong>England innings</strong></p> <p><strong>End-of-innings update</strong></p> <p>England were dismissed for 158 in the third and deciding one-dayer by Pakistan at Rawalpindi after another dismal performance against the spinners. There were still 43 balls remaining when the latest chapter in The Andy Caddick Guide to Hairbrained Singles was written and Graham Thorpe was run out for 39 with both batsmen stuck at the same end. It was a fitting end to a farcical innings, which was twice interrupted by tear gas drifting onto the field.</p> <p>A steady seventh-wicket stand of 47 between Thorpe and Mark Ealham (who should be ahead of Craig White in the order) came to an end when Abdur Razzaq got one to nip back between Ealham's bat and pad and hit the top of middle and off. It was Razzaq's 100th one-day international wicket, and it left England 133 for 7 in the 37th over.</p> <p>The 150 came up in the 40th, and the tear gas struck again before Saqlain Mushtaq won a leg-before shout against Ashley Giles. The ball went straight on and hit Giles on the back leg, although there must have been some doubt as to whether it would have gone on to hit leg. It may not have been Saqlain's doosra, but Giles looked mystified nonetheless and left the field for 11 to make it 156 for 8.</p> <p>Two balls later it was 156 for 9: Darren Gough tried to sweep Saqlain but the ball ricocheted back onto his stumps. It was Saqlain's fifth wicket - for just 20 runs - and the 15th England have lost in the series to spin - as against seven to seam. Thorpe had hung on gamely for 71 balls, but fell victim to Caddick's cock-up. </p> <p>Pakistan surely won't blow it from here.</p> <p><strong>35-over update</strong></p> <p>Graham Thorpe and Mark Ealham were at least giving England a total to defend after the top-order had again made a mess of playing Pakistan's spinners in the deciding one-dayer at Rawalpindi. After 35 overs, England had stumbled to 128 for 6, with the seventh-wicket partnership worth 42.</p> <p>England lost their sixth wicket in the 24th over, at which stage their only aim was to bat out their 50 overs. Runs came at a trickle, and the 100 arrived in the 29th over when Ealham swept a Shahid Afridi no-ball for four. It was England's first boundary for nine overs.</p> <p>Two overs later Ealham used his feet to biff Afridi over mid-on for four more. Thorpe, who passed 2000 runs in one-day internationals earlier in his innings, was content with ones and twos. England will need more than that if they're going to set Pakistan an even remotely challenging total.</p> <p><strong>25-over update</strong></p> <p>England were heading for a big defeat in the deciding one-dayer against Pakistan at Rawalpindi. After 25 overs they had slumped to 91 for 6 after another limp display against Pakistan's spinners. It could be a long tour.</p> <p>Andy Flintoff and Graham Thorpe had demonstrated for a while what can be achieved with straight hitting and good footwork. When Mushtaq Ahmed dropped short, Flintoff stood up, and hit him along the ground back past him for four. And in the next over Thorpe thumped his Surrey colleague Saqlain Mushtaq over his head for four more - an unusual shot for a man who rarely hits it in the air unless he's playing the hook or the pull.</p> <p>Runs came easily for a couple of overs, but England lost their fifth wicket in Shahid Afridi's first over as Flintoff propped forward at a ball that turned slightly and edged a catch to Ahzar Mahmood at slip for 10 to make it 85 for 5.</p> <p>In the next over Craig White played a shot he will want to forget.

      "bodyText": "Pakistan innings Pakistan have won the third one-day international against England at Rawalpindi and with it the series, by two games to one. They reached their target of 159 with more than six overs to spare and for the loss of just four wickets. After their hammering in Karachi, Pakistan have reasserted themselves brilliantly. A careful fourth-wicket stand of 77 in almost 25 overs between Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana came to an end the ball after Youhana had showed some rare aggression, flicking Craig White through square-leg for four. He then heaved wildly, missed and the ball cannoned into the base of off stump. Youhana had made 31 off 90 balls - not usually enough to win a one-day international, but England's batting effort meant Pakistan were never hurried. At 128 for 4, Pakistan were virtually home and dry, and Inzamam moved to his half-century, from 96 deliveries, before Adur Razzaq, whose 75* at Karachi was quickly forgotten after Flintoff's fireworks, launched Andy Caddick over mid-off for four. He creamed the next ball through the covers. Inzamam was badly missed by Ashley Giles at mid-off in the next over and should have been run out with seven needed after a characteristic mix-up, but Pakistan knocked off the remaining runs with ease. Inzamam finished unbeaten on 60, and Razzaq cracked a nine-ball 17. England now have to work out how to play the spinners before the Test series starts in Lahore on November 15. 35-over update Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana had extended their fourth-wicket partnership to 54 after 35 overs of Pakistan's reply to England's 158. At that point Pakistan were 105 for 3, and on course for a comfortable, if dull victory in the one-day series. England's bowlers were doing a good containing job - just 54 runs had come from the previous 20 overs - but Pakistan never needed to score at much more than three an over, and you always felt they would move up a gear if they had to. Mark Ealham (5-0-9-0) took the pace off the ball on a slow pitch that offered turn, while Ashley Giles (8-0-24-1) at least offered some hope for the Test series ahead by finding bounce and maintaining an accurate line. But England were unable to make the breakthrough they needed, and when the 100 came up in the 35th over, a baying crowd was already celebrating. Inzamam brought up the 50 stand by pulling Darren Gough's slower ball over midwicket for four, and England were left needing something special. 25-over update Pakistan should go on to win the third one-day international at Rawalpindi - and with it the series - but England's bowlers are making them work hard for the 159 they need. After 25 overs they had crawled to 72 for 3, having scored just 21 runs in their last 10. Inzamam-ul-Haq was not out 24 from 52 balls, while Yousuf Youhana had 6 from 37. The bowlers who put on the brakes were Craig White and Ashley Giles. White made good use of the slower ball to complete an outstanding first spell of 6-2-9-0 - four of those runs came when Inzamam top-edged a slower ball just in front of Alec Stewart and away to the boundary. Giles was almost as parsimonious, and found a good line and length to restrict the batsmen to pushed singles on the legside. Inzamam did crash the final ball of his sixth over to the cover boundary, but Giles's figures still read 6-0-16-1. But for all England's thrift, they still needed wickets. And while Inzamam was still there, Pakistan were red-hot favourites. 15-over update Pakistan reached 51 for 3 after 15 overs, and needed a further 108 to clinch the one-day series against England. Andy Caddick took two early wickets to bring England back into the game, and they almost picked up a third when Graeme Hick just failed to cling on to a tough chance, diving to his right at second slip after Darren Gough had found the outside edge of Salim Elahi's bat. That would have made it 17 for 3. Instead Elahi and Inzamam-ul-Haq progressed steadily against some tight bowling. Gough bowled consecutive maidens, and England were outstanding in the field. One stop by Nasser Hussain, diving full stretch at gully to stop a fierce drive from Elahi, was as good as anything Jonty Rhodes could do. Elahi did find the boundary in the 13th over though, following a gorgeous square-drive off Caddick for four with a straight-driven thump two balls later. Hussain threw the ball to Ashley Giles in the 15th over - and England snared their third wicket. The ball after Pakistan had moved to 50, Elahi nibbled at one outside off stump that turned and bounced and Hussain held on at slip to make it 51 for 3. Elahi had made 23 and England were back in it. 3-over update Andy Caddick struck twice in two balls to give England an outside chance in the crucial third one-day international against Pakistan at Rawalpindi. With the final ball of his first over he found some extra bounce outside off stump and Imran Nazir could only edge to Graeme Hick who dived to his left at second slip. 0 for 1. Shahid Afridi fought back in the next over, driving and pulling Darren Gough for consecutive boundaries, but he soon became Caddick's second victim. Aiming to drive the first ball of Caddick's second over, he picked out Nasser Hussain at point to make it 9 for 2. Inzamam-ul-Haq survived the hat-trick ball, but England were in with a shout. England innings End-of-innings update England were dismissed for 158 in the third and deciding one-dayer by Pakistan at Rawalpindi after another dismal performance against the spinners. There were still 43 balls remaining when the latest chapter in The Andy Caddick Guide to Hairbrained Singles was written and Graham Thorpe was run out for 39 with both batsmen stuck at the same end. It was a fitting end to a farcical innings, which was twice interrupted by tear gas drifting onto the field. A steady seventh-wicket stand of 47 between Thorpe and Mark Ealham (who should be ahead of Craig White in the order) came to an end when Abdur Razzaq got one to nip back between Ealham's bat and pad and hit the top of middle and off. It was Razzaq's 100th one-day international wicket, and it left England 133 for 7 in the 37th over. The 150 came up in the 40th, and the tear gas struck again before Saqlain Mushtaq won a leg-before shout against Ashley Giles. The ball went straight on and hit Giles on the back leg, although there must have been some doubt as to whether it would have gone on to hit leg. It may not have been Saqlain's doosra, but Giles looked mystified nonetheless and left the field for 11 to make it 156 for 8. Two balls later it was 156 for 9: Darren Gough tried to sweep Saqlain but the ball ricocheted back onto his stumps. It was Saqlain's fifth wicket - for just 20 runs - and the 15th England have lost in the series to spin - as against seven to seam. Thorpe had hung on gamely for 71 balls, but fell victim to Caddick's cock-up. Pakistan surely won't blow it from here. 35-over update Graham Thorpe and Mark Ealham were at least giving England a total to defend after the top-order had again made a mess of playing Pakistan's spinners in the deciding one-dayer at Rawalpindi. After 35 overs, England had stumbled to 128 for 6, with the seventh-wicket partnership worth 42. England lost their sixth wicket in the 24th over, at which stage their only aim was to bat out their 50 overs. Runs came at a trickle, and the 100 arrived in the 29th over when Ealham swept a Shahid Afridi no-ball for four. It was England's first boundary for nine overs. Two overs later Ealham used his feet to biff Afridi over mid-on for four more. Thorpe, who passed 2000 runs in one-day internationals earlier in his innings, was content with ones and twos. England will need more than that if they're going to set Pakistan an even remotely challenging total. 25-over update England were heading for a big defeat in the deciding one-dayer against Pakistan at Rawalpindi. After 25 overs they had slumped to 91 for 6 after another limp display against Pakistan's spinners. It could be a long tour. Andy Flintoff and Graham Thorpe had demonstrated for a while what can be achieved with straight hitting and good footwork. When Mushtaq Ahmed dropped short, Flintoff stood up, and hit him along the ground back past him for four. And in the next over Thorpe thumped his Surrey colleague Saqlain Mushtaq over his head for four more - an unusual shot for a man who rarely hits it in the air unless he's playing the hook or the pull. Runs came easily for a couple of overs, but England lost their fifth wicket in Shahid Afridi's first over as Flintoff propped forward at a ball that turned slightly and edged a catch to Ahzar Mahmood at slip for 10 to make it 85 for 5. In the next over Craig White played a shot he will want to forget. Saqlain delivered a rare full toss, White's eyes lit up and he hoicked it in the direction of the square-leg boundary - and straight towards Mushtaq Ahmed who completed a good catch diving forward. Saqlain smiled, White winced. His scores in this one-day series have been 0*, 0 and 0. At No. 7 in the order, White is a place too high. England's challenge now was to bat out their 50 overs. 16-over update England lost two wickets to Saqlain Mushtaq in the 16th over and were reeling at 64 for 4 after a decent start. In Lahore, Alec Stewart fell to the first ball from Mushtaq Ahmed, trying to disrupt him from the start. Now Graeme Hick was dismissed by Saqlain Mushtaq's first delivery, again to an attacking shot. The ball pitched outside off, Hick aimed a big drive and the ball spun back sharply through the gate. It was the sort of delivery with which Muttiah Muralitharan tormented England at The Oval in 1998. Hick departed for 3, and England were 63 for 3. Worse was to follow. Four balls later, Marcus Trescothick went back and tried to work a ball through the legside. But he missed and it hit the top of off. Saqlain's celebrations were muted - you sensed he didn't regard dismissing top-order English batsmen as much of a challenge. Trescothick had made 36, and England were up against it. 15-over update England made fitful progress in the third and deciding one-day international against Pakistan at Rawalpindi, and had reached 63 for 2 after 15 overs. Pakistan won the toss for the third consecutive match and opted to try to exploit any early movement in the wicket. The ploy worked well as Abdur Razzaq maintained a tight line outside off, and Wasim Akram troubled the right-handers as the ball slanted across. The bowlers dropped short occasionally, and England duly cashed in: in the fifth over, Marcus Trescothick pulled Wasim backward of square for four, and three overs later Alec Stewart slashed a Razzaq long hop through the covers.

Trescothick drove Razzaq through the covers for four, and brought up England's 50 in the 14th over with a cut for two off Azhar Mahmood that narrowly evaded the diving Inzamam-ul-Haq at slip. And in Mushtaq Ahmed's first over, Trescothick calmly struck three fours from successive deliveries, cutting the first, sweeping the second, then cutting the third. It had been a bizarre morning.

      "bodyText": "With little more than a week to go, America's third best-known candidate is running neck to neck with her opponent in New York state. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady, is eight points clear of Rick Lazio, according to a poll in this morning's New York Times. But another reputable polling organisation, working for the Times's raucous rival the New York Post, puts Lazio two points ahead. Newspapers in the state agree that turn out will be crucial to Clinton's attempt to launch her own political career in the US Senate. The New York Times, which has endorsed Al Gore in the main national race, points out the paradox that Clinton could be undermined by the apparently unassailable campaign by the Democrat presidential candidate. The paper says that, \"if it appears that vice president Al Gore is going to win New York easily - this poll suggests that he is 21 points ahead of George W Bush in New York, 52 percent to 31 percent - then Democrats may not bother to turn out in the numbers Mrs Clinton needs to win the race.\" The Times also slyly points out that Lazio may have scored an own goal by launching his most trenchant criticism of Clinton, over her role in health care legislation, during the sensational baseball World Series, featuring the New York Yankees and the New York Mets. Nobody in the city, it seems, was paying much attention to politics last week. The New York Post rather underscores the point. Its lead story is the celebratory tickertape parade by the victorious Yankees. Inside, it runs an editorial acid attack on Democrat vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman, who is also running for the Senate in Connecticut. It starts: \"Does Joe Lieberman know something that nobody else does? Or is he just trying to have it both ways?\" It goes on to question Lieberman's apparently radical shift of views towards Al Gore's liberal line, and concludes: \"So maybe it's not all that surprising that Lieberman decided to maintain a Connecticut bolt-hole. It's all about what's best for Joe, no?\" The Post also gives prominence to the nasty tale of the Republican telephone campaign to discredit Hillary Clinton by linking her to the terror bombing of the US Navy destroyer Dole in Yemen a few weeks ago. The party has wisely dropped the outrageous message, which was relayed to thousands of non-Jewish voters and accused Clinton of accepting money from an Arab organisation that \"openly brags about its support for a Mideast terrorism group, the same kind of terrorism that killed our sailors on the USS Cole.\" The equally strident New York Daily News - one of its main news stories is headed \"Judge could nix slay rap\" - wastes little time on political analysis. But it does approve of Chelsea Clinton. In a long piece, the paper notes how she is helping her mother's campaign. \"Much about Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's marriage remains a mystery, but they have indisputably raised a fine daughter - by all accounts, down to earth and spectacularly normal, but equipped with an extraordinary inner strength to endure when her family's private matters came under the harshest of public spotlights. \"It's a reason why Chelsea, a 20-year-old college student, has become such an asset to her mother's Senate campaign - and also a stand-in for the First Lady in her father's waning days in the White House.\" It is, as Americans say, a given that, while New York city remains solidly Democrat, the rest of the sprawling state tilts towards the Republicans. That is reflected in the Poughkeepsie Journal, which restricts is coverage of the senatorial race to a glowing account of a Lazio fundraising dinner. The Albany Times Union believes the Lazio campaign is faltering in the traditional conservative parts of the state. The paper highlights the crucial importance of the black vote: \"US Senator Chuck Schumer won his 1998 race against incumbent Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, with 87 per cent of the black vote. \"This year, African-Americans support Clinton over Lazio by a ratio of 93-3, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll.\" The paper also notes that the Clinton campaign too has had its up and down moments: \"In Ithaca, she was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd - and a man shouting, 'Mrs Clinton, who did your husband rape today'?\" The Schenectady Daily Gazette reports Al Gore's latest barnstorming tour of California, to shore up his sagging support in a state where many had assumed his victory to be assured.

      "bodyText": "The Department of Trade and Industry is to launch an investigation into allegations that tobacco giant British American Tobacco is implicated in smuggling, it said today. Secretary of State Stephen Byers said that he had appointed investigators to look into the allegations in response to a Health Select Committee report on the tobacco industry. He said: \"I have given careful consideration to the unanimous recommendation of the select committee that the DTI should investigate the allegations of BAT's involvement in smuggling. \"I have decided to appoint investigators to look into this and to report back to me as soon as possible. \"I will then decide what further steps I must take and whether the facts support a reference to other authorities.\" BAT said in a statement that it was \"naturally disappointed\" at the move by Mr Byers. \"We will, of course, cooperate fully with the investigators, but will be making no further comments during the course of their work,\" it said. A spokeswoman for Conservative former chancellor Kenneth Clarke said that Mr Clarke, as deputy chairman for BAT, had no comment to make. \"Mr Clarke is not making a statement. The company has done so,\" she said. In February, Mr Clarke sought to rebut accusations that BAT was involved in large-scale cigarette smuggling and that it indirectly encouraged drug runners' money laundering operations. The accusations stemmed from research conducted by the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) and investigative journalist Duncan Campbell. The allegations have also been aired by Channel 4 News. It was claimed that BAT's own internal documentation demonstrated that the company was involved in orchestrating, managing and controlling cigarette smuggling in Asia and Latin America in the early 1990s, with BAT exercising control over illegal distribution channels through intermediaries. But Mr Clarke, a former health secretary as well as chancellor, told the House of Commons select committee on health that the accusations were unfounded. Mr Clarke acknowledged that cigarettes were smuggled into markets such as Colombia, but insisted that BAT was not involved in that process. \"There is no evidence I have ever seen that BAT is a participant in this smuggling. We seek to minimise it and avoid it,\" Mr Clarke told the committee. Mr Clarke insisted that BAT was \"a company of integrity and a good corporate citizen\", which observed not only the requirements of the law in the countries in which it operated, but also \"good ethical standards\". BAT chairman Martin Broughton also denied, before the committee's February hearing, any wrongdoing on his company's part. Asked if he refuted the accusations that the company was involved in managing cigarette smuggling and money laundering, he insisted: \"I refute those (accusations) completely.\" In what was often a heated session, at one point Mr Broughton demonstrated his feelings about Mr Campbell's research by tearing up one document that the journalist presented as part of his efforts to substantiate his claims. In his evidence to the committee, Mr Campbell explained that South American-based drug runners raise huge sums by smuggling narcotics such as cocaine and heroin into the United States, then \"launder\" the dollars generated by using them to buy cigarettes, which are smuggled back into their own countries. Mr Campbell claimed that BAT \"assiduously\" and \"deliberately\" supported the cigarette smuggling market. In June, in a report it published on the impact of smoking, the committee called for an inquiry into the allegations. Director of Ash Clive Bates said: \"We think the evidence that BAT has been controlling and facilitating tobacco smuggling is overwhelming. \"We are just delighted that the DTI is going to hold them to account. I think this will be a turning point in the fight against tobacco smuggling, because the authorities will have the evidence that the tobacco industry itself is a major player in global smuggling. \"The tobacco industry will no longer be seen as friends but somebody working hand-in-glove with organised crime. \"While not doing the smuggling themselves, they are doing everything necessary to make sure smuggling happens in their commercial interests and on a very large scale,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>For the hip American director under 30, there's a certain way of doing things. You pull in some favours, you scrape together a budget (a few thousand dollars on a credit card), you make your movie. Make it startle, make it in raw, attention-grabbing black and white and, with luck, it'll make you a star: Hollywood awaits. Which is precisely how life was shaping up for Darren Aronofsky after his 1998 debut, the paranoid, iconoclastic Pi. Two years later, the Brooklyn-born Aronofsky has hit paydirt, with a lucrative deal to write and direct his own contribution to the Batman franchise. </p> <p>Except it wasn't as straightforward as that: following the acclaim that greeted Pi, Tinseltown and its caped crusaders were kept on hold a while longer. Edging still further from the mainstream, the then 28-year-old Aronofsky decided to work with Hubert Selby Jr, veteran gutter chronicler and author of Last Exit to Brooklyn. The result is Requiem for a Dream, a brutally seductive adaptation of Selby's 1978 novella, set against the faded funhouses of Coney Island, New York (a stone's throw from where both men grew up). The bleak, nerveless story of three twentysomething junkies, the middle-aged, diet-pill addicted mother of one, and - in Aronofsky's words - \"the lengths we go to escape reality\", it's one of the most harrowing films in years. </p> <p>It's also one of the best, with a dazzling visual swagger and a slew of split screens and rapid-fire cuts - \"hip-hop montage\" is how Aronofsky describes it. \"Stylistically,\" he explains, \"I try be an expressionist, to use the camera to push the emotion of the scene. That's the goal, to marry style with performance. And there'll be some people who can't hang with that, because it's a young style. It's designed for people who grew up with a lot of visual stimulus.\" </p> <p>He's not wrong. The danger, of course, is that among daintier critics such a freewheeling aesthetic could be dismissed as MTV film-making. \"Well, that's the biggest insult that could be levelled at me,\" he says. \"Because MTV is style without substance, and we discipline ourselves so that every stylistic choice we make has a solid narrative reason behind it.\" And, in fact, what that decision-making produces is a pure cinematic language that recalls a time before indie movies talked themselves into oblivion. Dealing with such potentially cumbersome material as heroin and self-help, Requiem says more with a single shot than a thousand lines of addled dialogue. </p> <p>\"The subject matter is so intense, and so dark, that if you made it like a Dogme movie it would basically be unwatchable,\" says Aronofsky. \"The pyrotechnics make the film more accessible. This way, the narrative sneaks up on you emotionally.\" </p> <p>Given the unflinching nature of the piece, \"sneaks\" is the wrong word: \"mangles\" might be more appropriate. But there is more to Requiem than visual gimcracks, not least the inspired performances Aronofsky elicits from his cast, in particularEllen Burstyn. Still best known as Linda Blair's mother in The Exorcist, here she is cast as Sara Goldfarb, a Brooklyn widow desperate to lose weight for a TV appearance. </p> <p>\"The thing about Ellen is that because of Hollywood's ageism and sexism, she really hasn't had a lead role since the 1970s. So, even though I was a big fan of her films back then, I really wasn't sure what she could do. But she showed the world. I mean, she certainly showed me.\" Equally, Burstyn's tour de force opens up the story beyond the confines (remarkable though they are) of the film's parallel storyline, in which Jared Leto (as Sara's dope-fiend son Harry), Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly sacrifice everything for the \"pound of pure\" that will, in theory, put them on Easy Street. </p> <p>\"But the thing is,\" Aronofsky says, \"I never wanted to make that film. For me, the most interesting part of the movie was always Sara, because of the counterpoint she offers. People have seen the junkie movie before, you know, but Sara elevated this film into a story of how we all struggle with addiction.\" </p> <p>Heroin, to Aronofsky, is the least of it. \"When you're chasing after a future you're never going to get, you create a hole in the present. You use anything to fill that hole, whether that's drugs, or the dream of a better life. And what happens is, the hole keeps growing until it engulfs you.\" Presumably that also goes for a film-maker as obsessive as Aronofsky? \"Oh, definitely. Completely. Work fills the hole. Sure.\" </p> <p>As, of course, do happy endings, Hollywood's holy grail, longed for but never found in Requiem for a Dream. With Batman in the bag (\"I'll do it if they let me do it the way I want\"), you might think Aronofsky was finally adjusting to the studios' value system. Then again, it may be some time before he's wheeling out soft, cuddly Hollywood product. </p> <p>\"Eighty per cent of ticket sales across the world go to Hollywood movies,\" he points out, \"and because of that, people are almost brainwashed into expecting a catharsis. But anyone who's been on the planet long enough knows that, in the end, things seldom work out OK. That's what tragedy is about. And tragedy is an art form that's been killed by Hollywood. I mean, with Requiem, the catharsis is really there for the audience the day after they've seen the movie.\" </p> <p>Slowly, he clears his throat. \"Because, you know, it's certainly not happening on screen.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Requiem for a Dream is screened as part of the London film festival on Saturday and November 6. Box office: 020-7928 3232. It will be released on January 19.</p>",

A \u00a39,300 award from the Nuffield foundation is to employ a part-time researcher to collect archive material, including documents relating to the Piper Alpha oil platform explosion in 1988 and the murders committed by Frederick and Rosemary West. The collection will hold academic publications, media coverage and centre research. Civil and criminal legal material relating to the disasters, such as transcripts of court cases and reports and evidence given to inquiries and inquests, will also be included. The archive is available at the centre for studies in crime and social justice",

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago, climate change was a worry far away on the horizon, more of concern to grandchildren, a problem that, as responsible citizens, we should tackle soon. This week, as the south east of England was battered by the latest in a series of storms the threat seemed much more immediate - once in 30 years floods had come twice in a month to places in Kent and Sussex. While all the international political focus has been on reducing carbon dioxide emissions to avert future global warming, an equally important second area of work has been progressing on local adaptation to its effects, which are soon to be. In the UK there have been, so far largely unheeded warnings about not building on flood plains, plus unreported changes to building regulations so that tall buildings can withstand higher wind speeds. The response to the danger of ever increasing sea levels has been to add another few feet to the height of sea walls around property on the coast and abandon some poorer quality agricultural land to the sea as no longer worth the expense of protecting. It is the small beginning of a new era in a Britain and the rest of Europe that is used to a benign climate. Extremes were always regarded as rare and generally happened somewhere else - the United States being a prime example. Scientists are still reluctant to say that what is happening to the British climate can be blamed on global warming. While they say that this is the sort of weather we could expect as a result of global warming, they say that current events have not been going on long enough to be sure. But the evidence of climate change is building all the time. On average, British birds nest two weeks earlier than 30 years ago. Insect species - including bees and termites - that need warmer weather to survive are moving north. Some have already crossed the Channel from France. It is now warm enough for malaria mosquitoes to survive and breed in Sussex. Glaciers in Europe are in retreat, particular in the Alps and Iceland. Icecaps throughout the world are getting smaller - even the North Pole was ice free for part of this summer. Extremes of weather are driven by heat, together with the contrast between the hot tropics and the cold poles. The warmer the sea the more intense the storms - and the average wave height in the Atlantic has increased - making the damage that a rise in sea level can do to the coast even greater. If this is not climate change then it is a pretty good example of what to expect from now on. It seems the British fascination with the weather is set to continue.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Michael March: For 50 years you have devoted yourself to poetry and religion. What have you seen, what have you felt, what has moved you the most in this life?</strong></p> <p>RS Thomas: The open air. I was never an academic. I don't despise scholarship, but it's not for me. The hours that I could have spent improving my mind or widening my knowledge have been spent in open air. I never went anything better than the natural world. I am guilty of what the scholastic world has called \"the worship of created things\". You are supposed only to worship God. But I have approached life through creative things, especially the beauty of the Earth.</p> <p><strong>MM: Has not the earth become clouded over, even more so then in the past?</strong></p> <p>RST: Well, man is domesticating earth. This is what I deplore. You know Yeats's turn about John O'Leary: \"Romantic Ireland's dead and gone. It's with John O'Leary in the grave.\" Romantic Wales is gone. Has it ever existed? Has romantic Ireland ever existed? My young person's romantic view - rather like Coleridge in his dejection - has been explored. I can see that there is no such thing for me any longer as a romantic world, and this is why I turned to birdwatching - because birds were the only creatures that have preserved their natural, traditional way of life, without being impinged on by the machine and commerce and all these other things.</p> <p><strong>MM: How do you envision a romantic world populated by man? How would man behave in such a world?</strong></p> <p>RST: This is the artist's dilemma. To me, time is of the essence, although I have wasted so much of it. Nevertheless, one needs time, and the romantic view of life would be one in which man earned his livelihood with his hands, made his clothes, constructed his living quarters and lived a traditional life preserving a folk tradition. But that needs time. So unless you are going to have a male-dominated society where the woman does all these things and leaves the man free to pursue his own heart - life, whether in music or in painting or in literature - it's not possible, there isn't enough time.</p> <p><strong>MM: We return to time and I perceive that poetry is closely allied to time.</strong></p> <p>RST: Time is a mercurial thing. If there is such a thing as a next world, one presumes that it will be timeless because time has a connection with memory and to be conscious of time is to be restless and unfulfilled. We look before and after and pine for what is not. I know that probably some of my sweetest moments have been when time has not existed - when you are on an island with the sea whispering around and the wind suddenly falls still and the sun breaks through and, just for a moment, time ceases.</p> <p><strong>MM: Poetry has a slower metabolism than the business world, the everyday world. One must take time to digest words, words which come from different periods of history. There's an archaeology, an alchemy in words. To digest words is almost a forbidden act, because today one must be ruthlessly efficient, ruthlessly pursuing business rather than focusing on time or trying to understand our life and death. </strong> </p> <p>RST: I have felt for a very long time that we are paying for our conquest of space by losing touch with time. Time is seemingly meaningless now. You think that with the machine doing so much for you that there would be more time, but the irony is that there is less. I like to think that poetry is a mature art. In our English-speaking tradition you don't get much great poetry from young people; it needs time to mature. Nevertheless, in some strange way there have been people in the past who have died young and who have produced an enormous amount of poetry. I was talking about this once with a professor of English. I said that I tended to waste my time; I used bags of time. He said I probably knew instinctively that I was going to live a long time, whereas someone like Keats instinctively realised that he was going to live a short time.</p> <p><strong> MM: What is the place of poetry in our present civilisation?</strong></p> <p>RST: I don't know if that can be decided at any one instant. We're obviously living at the end of a millennium; we would like to think that things are in the crucible and that the new millennium will bring forth new things. It would be cheering to think that this question is going to be decided in the coming century, but I think the great battle for poetry is with the machine, as I have tried to say in some of my poetry. The machine dehumanises. Wordsworth, as we know, said: \"Thanks to this human heart by which we live /Things that can move him deeper than tears/ All because of our human heart.\" Well, we're already becoming familiar with the possibility of an artificial heart. The whole thing seems to land you in nonsense.</p> <p><strong>It used to be pig-headed, now it's pig-hearted. Perhaps lion-hearted man will return us to another time, another place, through natural sex.</strong></p> <p>RST: We must turn everything in. We are too outward. When I have a thought, I must turn it in. We're living in a superficial age, when everything is on the surface. Sex is one of the things which 20th-century western man has become obsessed with, and the result is shallowness. I'd like to think that man was more passionate in the past. Some of the great works, especially in music, or like the Divine Comedy of Dante, are works of passion. This is something that we have lost, as Frost would say, by being too 'out'. We're too outward.</p> <p><strong> MM: Sitting in Prague, in central Europe, reading Milan Kundera's new novel Slowness, I have a longing to return to the coy sexuality of the 18th century. To return to the chase, the retrieve, the approach, a playful conversation which seems lost today.</strong></p> <p>RST: I hate the 18th century, speaking generally. I would go back to earlier periods, as I suggested, with Dante. My father was a sailor. I had leanings towards the sea, but he'd been through the hard days of an apprenticeship in sailing ships and seen what a hard life it could be. To me, there is nothing more beautiful than a full-rigged ship. That's the romantic picture; the realities are something different. If you're going to praise, say, the 14th century, you also must remember that there was blood, there was violence, life was short. It must have been out of this tension that people's emotions and sensibilities became sharpened. It was the same thing during the last war - once people are under pressure their instincts and responses become sharpened. It is possible that a work of art is more likely to be born out of that situation.</p> <p><strong>MM: What do you have against the 18th century?</strong></p> <p>RST: It's the rationalist century. I mean, Pope and Dryden and people like that are a disaster. They are academic fodder. All the professors and lecturers love Pope and Dryden because somebody else has written about them so they can write about what somebody else has written about them. It was also the rationalist period. I don't know if I am getting my dates quite right but Locke and people like that - I dislike the whole approach.</p> <p><strong>Skipping the revolution, do things change?</strong></p> <p>RST: How much is really new? How much is really new that matters? I mean, the aeroplane is new. The computer is new. I don't know of what importance they are. They are of no importance to me at all. I think that we'd be much better off if the people of the world had never discovered each other. If they had led their own lives, with large areas of water between them.</p> <p><strong>MM: What about politics?</strong></p> <p>RST: Party politics are eternal, of course. The Greek were concerned with politics as a discipline, an area of knowledge - the right construction and management of the state, the good of the state and its people. And we've been through dictatorships in countries like Germany and Russia and Italy. We're also saddled with the myth of democracy. All these things are a mixture of personal ambition and greed and cleverness and the manipulation of language. Whereas truth is manipulable in the interests not of the state, but of the individual or the party. This is the \"treason of the clerks\" that Pindar spoke of. If we feel as I feel, we should fight the battle and not put up with this bunch of party politicians. But then each one of us has got his own axe to grind. I would have never written my poetry if I had chosen to fight on the political field.</p> <p><strong>MM: What was your reaction to the communist states?</strong></p> <p>RST: It's the question of pacifism. If you're a member of a small nation, as I am - the Welsh nation has no real power, material power - the ultimate battle would have been a personal one. If Hitler had won and national socialism had taken over, we would have had to stand and resist in Wales, but we wouldn't have resisted as a nation. Each one would have had to fight his own personal battle. And, of course, materially you lose every time. It's a matter of whether you can keep the spirit alive in such circumstances.</p> <p><strong>MM: Convenience is often more alive than bravery.</strong></p> <p>RST: I am very conscious of this as a member of the Welsh nation. Those of us who have the good of the Welsh nation at heart want people to make the sacrifice. If we gain independence from England, life will become more expensive. You can't have these things unless you pay for them. You either pay with blood, which in the Welsh case is hardly possible, or you pay with money. Independence would cut the individual Welshman much more, because it is true to say to some extent that Wales is subsidised by England. This is England's great boast. It's the fleshpots of Egypt, isn't it? When they led the children of Israel towards freedom, they regretted the time when they had the fleshpots. Many people in Wales would regret the time when they felt materially better off under England, once they were living in a free Wales.</p> <p><strong>MM: Where is the crosssover between materialism, spirituality and freedom? This seems pertinent with respect to present-day China.</strong></p> <p>RST: We've just got far too many people in the world. The progressives, the materialistic, the scientists, they all say: \"Oh, we could feed many more people than we already have.\" But even if it is possible you've got the other problem of distribution. To my mind, the best thing is to cut down. In a small country like Wales, I don't think that it would be necessary to cut down the population but to redistribute it. We're too heavy: we've got over half the population of Wales in the south, in the old industrial belt. If it could be redistributed we'd be fine. But with countries like China, Russia, India, countries in southeast Asia, they've just got far too many people.</p> <p><strong>MM: Why not achieve independence for Wales by promoting a cultural revolution in England? At least half the people would starve to death.</strong></p> <p>RST: (laughter) One has to employ draconian methods. But then, who's going to employ them?</p> <p><strong>MM: Our present government is doing the reverse - they're putting everyone in jail. But that's not a solution.</strong></p> <p>RST: They have no solution. The old Greek idea of nemesis is still applicable. You get rewarded in accordance with your policies, your way of thinking. I don't know how long it can be postponed, but the whole ethos of the west is heading towards nemesis.</p> <p><strong>MM: To where do you turn? Do you see poetry as a form of prayer?</strong></p> <p>RST: No, I see it almost entirely as language-centred. Every poet of any quality loves words. They are what he works with, just as a painter works with paint and texture, a musician works with notes - so a poet works with words. It's a kind of ongoing struggle as to who is to be master. You begin by being, more or less, dominated by the words. You gradually attain a certain mastery, and then you realise it's a bit like touch-typing - you reach a state when you can half be mastered and half dominate. Out of that subtle association, the better works of poetry are born. To have reached a stage of development where you can give yourself to the language and let it carry you along. And yet, all the while, you've also got a hand on the reins to see that it doesn't run completely away with you.</p> <p><strong>MM: What stage is silence?</strong></p> <p>RST: Well, I can't really be silent. I was never any good at meditation. When I was at theological college, we were expected to meditate; once a week there was a certain period set aside. I can never meditate because my mind is not silent - it's full of words chasing each other. I'm fascinated by rhythms and the possibilities of words. You go chasing after new thoughts all the time. I would never set myself up as one of these sages sitting and contemplating his navel in complete silence.</p> <p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.pwf.globalone.cz\">Prague Writers Festival site</a>, which includes archive material from this and previous year's festivals.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Michael March: For 50 years you have devoted yourself to poetry and religion. What have you seen, what have you felt, what has moved you the most in this life? RS Thomas: The open air. I was never an academic. I don't despise scholarship, but it's not for me. The hours that I could have spent improving my mind or widening my knowledge have been spent in open air. I never went anything better than the natural world. I am guilty of what the scholastic world has called \"the worship of created things\". You are supposed only to worship God. But I have approached life through creative things, especially the beauty of the Earth. MM: Has not the earth become clouded over, even more so then in the past? RST: Well, man is domesticating earth. This is what I deplore. You know Yeats's turn about John O'Leary: \"Romantic Ireland's dead and gone. It's with John O'Leary in the grave.\" Romantic Wales is gone. Has it ever existed? Has romantic Ireland ever existed? My young person's romantic view - rather like Coleridge in his dejection - has been explored. I can see that there is no such thing for me any longer as a romantic world, and this is why I turned to birdwatching - because birds were the only creatures that have preserved their natural, traditional way of life, without being impinged on by the machine and commerce and all these other things. MM: How do you envision a romantic world populated by man? How would man behave in such a world? RST: This is the artist's dilemma. To me, time is of the essence, although I have wasted so much of it. Nevertheless, one needs time, and the romantic view of life would be one in which man earned his livelihood with his hands, made his clothes, constructed his living quarters and lived a traditional life preserving a folk tradition. But that needs time. So unless you are going to have a male-dominated society where the woman does all these things and leaves the man free to pursue his own heart - life, whether in music or in painting or in literature - it's not possible, there isn't enough time. MM: We return to time and I perceive that poetry is closely allied to time. RST: Time is a mercurial thing. If there is such a thing as a next world, one presumes that it will be timeless because time has a connection with memory and to be conscious of time is to be restless and unfulfilled. We look before and after and pine for what is not. I know that probably some of my sweetest moments have been when time has not existed - when you are on an island with the sea whispering around and the wind suddenly falls still and the sun breaks through and, just for a moment, time ceases. MM: Poetry has a slower metabolism than the business world, the everyday world. One must take time to digest words, words which come from different periods of history. There's an archaeology, an alchemy in words. To digest words is almost a forbidden act, because today one must be ruthlessly efficient, ruthlessly pursuing business rather than focusing on time or trying to understand our life and death. RST: I have felt for a very long time that we are paying for our conquest of space by losing touch with time. Time is seemingly meaningless now. You think that with the machine doing so much for you that there would be more time, but the irony is that there is less. I like to think that poetry is a mature art. In our English-speaking tradition you don't get much great poetry from young people; it needs time to mature. Nevertheless, in some strange way there have been people in the past who have died young and who have produced an enormous amount of poetry. I was talking about this once with a professor of English. I said that I tended to waste my time; I used bags of time. He said I probably knew instinctively that I was going to live a long time, whereas someone like Keats instinctively realised that he was going to live a short time. MM: What is the place of poetry in our present civilisation? RST: I don't know if that can be decided at any one instant. We're obviously living at the end of a millennium; we would like to think that things are in the crucible and that the new millennium will bring forth new things. It would be cheering to think that this question is going to be decided in the coming century, but I think the great battle for poetry is with the machine, as I have tried to say in some of my poetry. The machine dehumanises. Wordsworth, as we know, said: \"Thanks to this human heart by which we live /Things that can move him deeper than tears/ All because of our human heart.\" Well, we're already becoming familiar with the possibility of an artificial heart.

Whether you describe the difference between \u00a360bn and \u00a368bn as a spending cut or merely a smaller spending increase, obviously depends on your political viewpoint.

It was created by McCann-Erickson in Manchester and is the most intensive recruitment campaign for years.</p> <p>Ms Morris said: \"Teaching is one of the most important jobs in the country and we need to recruit more graduates into the profession. </p> <p>\"There has never been a better time for them to join - for the first time training salaries of \u00a36,000 are available, with extra incentives of \u00a34,000 for those who train in and go to teach shortage subjects.\"</p> <p>But Mr de Gruchy said the campaign was full of ambiguous gimmicks. </p> <p>He said: \"The NASUWT will not be distracted from the real issues of bureaucracy, workload, pay, professional autonomy and pupil behaviour. These will determine the ability of teaching to recruit and retain able young people.\"</p> <p>In March the Teacher Training Agency feared a potential drop in graduate applications of up to 20%. The TTA claims the new salaries have prevented that decline. </p> <p>The government is also introducing performance-related pay for teachers and new career structures enabling classroom teachers to earn up to \u00a330,000 a year. A fast track programme will offer the best graduates the chance to progress more rapidly into leadership and management positions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of teachers' union the NASUWT, has attacked the Teacher Training Agency's new advertising campaign as \"another triumph of image over substance\". The campaign, launched today by schools standards minister Estelle Morris, aims to attract the country's brightest graduates into teaching. It was created by McCann-Erickson in Manchester and is the most intensive recruitment campaign for years. Ms Morris said: \"Teaching is one of the most important jobs in the country and we need to recruit more graduates into the profession. \"There has never been a better time for them to join - for the first time training salaries of \u00a36,000 are available, with extra incentives of \u00a34,000 for those who train in and go to teach shortage subjects.\" But Mr de Gruchy said the campaign was full of ambiguous gimmicks. He said: \"The NASUWT will not be distracted from the real issues of bureaucracy, workload, pay, professional autonomy and pupil behaviour. These will determine the ability of teaching to recruit and retain able young people.\" In March the Teacher Training Agency feared a potential drop in graduate applications of up to 20%. The TTA claims the new salaries have prevented that decline. The government is also introducing performance-related pay for teachers and new career structures enabling classroom teachers to earn up to \u00a330,000 a year. A fast track programme will offer the best graduates the chance to progress more rapidly into leadership and management positions.",

On Friday they allowed Shahid Afridi, a legspinner who barely turns the ball, to record the best figures for Pakistan against England in a one-day international -\u00ad five for 40. The record stood for a full three days before being broken today by Saqlain Mushtaq (5 for 20), who does turn his legbreaks, even though he is an offspinner. If Moin Khan hadn't mysteriously removed him from the attack after six overs (3 for 15), Saqlain might have threatened Muralitharan's even-newer record for the best bowling ever in a one-day international (7 for 30 against India on Sunday). And England might well have been all out for 100.</p> <p>Three things can be said in their defence. First, Saqlain is an outstanding bowler in the one-day game. (Though not often in Tests, where his bowling average this year is 45.) Secondly, both of England's collapses today started with tear gas. Whether the Pakistan police have found the right way to disperse their own countrymen is debatable, but it certainly works on passing Englishmen. When the first whiff reached the batsmen's eyes, England were comfortably placed at 35 for none. Alec Stewart then got an eyeful of it, and when he emerged from behind his hankie, he walked straight into a simple trap set by Abdur Razzaq, a man 17 years his junior. The headline writers traditionally call him Smart Alec. Today it was more a case of Smarting Alec.</p> <p>Then came the third thing. Wasim Akram bowled a slower ball, a Phil-Tufnell-in-defensive-mode special, turning into the right-hander from over the wicket. It pitched well outside leg, and therefore could not possibly have been lbw. Hussain missed it and was struck on the pad. Wasim appealed, perhaps under the impression that he was still bowling to Marcus Trescothick. The correct thing for Mian Mohammad Aslam to do was to report Wasim to Moin and the match referee, for appealing when he knew the batsman wasn't out (a form of gamesmanship explicitly banned in the new Laws). Instead he gave Hussain out, and thus snatched the lead in the Worst Decision of the Tour Contest from Riazuddin when he skewered Stewart in Karachi. Akram should be ashamed of himself for appealing. Aslam should resign.</p> <p>But that was no excuse for the procession that followed. Hick was thick, slogging at Saqlain's first ball. Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it and Hick managed two repetitions in one \u00ad departing needlessly for virtually nothing, as he himself did in Lahore, and lunging fatally at a spinner's first ball, as Stewart had to Mushtaq Ahmed, also in Lahore.</p> <p>Flintoff reverted to propping forward without thinking and White holed out a la England in Nairobi. Of the top seven, only Hussain and the two left-handers were blameless. Trescothick and Thorpe made more than half of England's runs from the bat, and Thorpe might have got a few more if he hadn't had to run with Andy Caddick, the Inzy of the western world.</p> <p>Caddick redeemed himself with two early wickets to give England a faint chance of winning the match and the series. But all Pakistan had to do was see him off. As so often in one-day cricket overseas, England were waiting for a miracle.</p> <p><em>Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com.

Trescothick and Thorpe made more than half of England's runs from the bat, and Thorpe might have got a few more if he hadn't had to run with Andy Caddick, the Inzy of the western world. Caddick redeemed himself with two early wickets to give England a faint chance of winning the match and the series. But all Pakistan had to do was see him off. As so often in one-day cricket overseas, England were waiting for a miracle. Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com. He can be emailed at timde@johnbrown.co.uk.

Many issues, said Dr Meadows, make far more taxing intellectual demands on respondents than their organisers realise, and the answers can easily stray towards the meaningless or trite. \"People have a natural tendency to give well-meant generalisations which those who actually have to make a decision cannot do,\" he said. \"Or they could be deceiving themselves, as can happen in health checks when a GP asks how many glasses of wine or beer you drink per week.\" The gathering coincides with a forthcoming circular to local councils and other decision-making authorities from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, emphasising the need for best practice in consultation. Schemes such as a pilot in Lincolnshire, where council tax rebates are being offered as an incentive to fill in council service questionnaires, have raised concern that polling methods should be more sophisticated than the \"do you like this sample of chocolate\" model. The conference, on Cognitive Aspects of Survey Methodology, will draw particularly on experience in the United States, where polling and focus groups have been part of the political and business marketing scene for longer than elsewhere. The conference findings are expected to help the framing of the next census, the biggest of all the government's dialogues with its citizens.",

      "byline": "Giles Smith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Car design works in reverse. The more a vehicle is made to look rugged and ready for that all-night, cross-mountain trek over gravel, ice and the carcasses of dead sheep, the more likely it is to earn a strictly urban cachet and be unlikely to be called upon for so much as a hill-start. This certainly seems to be the story with the sports utility vehicle, or SUV. </p> <p>The snazzier models are what today's ram raider or rap star is wearing uptown at the weekend. The ones with the quieter boom boxes are for urban or suburban people who have families but want to insist that this hasn't entirely exhausted their appetite for life. In either form, the SUV has dealt a blow to the pride of the hatchback, which used to do well by both these social groups but which these days looks timid and grey-complexioned beside these pumped-up, rounded-off bundles of energy. </p> <p>Sports utility - it's a boldly yoked concept. What \"sports\" means in these circumstances is surprisingly fast engines, stiff suspensions and the ability to get airborne at speed bumps. What \"utility\" seems to mean, however, is, actually, \"inutility\", in the sense that the cars tend to come generously decked with features for which the average urban owner will have little or no use, such as chunky anti-rhino bars, rear storage spaces the size of horse boxes, and four-wheel drives. </p> <p>But what, then, are we to make of the compact SUV? Regular SUVs are, generally, the kind of car you can walk into without ducking and they appeal to the consumer whose desire is to own an extremely large lump of metal. The idea, then, of a deliberately compact one is necessarily hedged about with contradictions, but the vehicle must presumably be aimed at people who want to own an extremely large lump of metal but who don't quite have the heart or the driveway to carry it through. </p> <p>The Toyota RAV4 is a compact SUV. Toyota pretty much invented this concept-within-a-concept six years ago, with the original RAV4, and are now revisiting it. The new model is tall and roomy and fairly big, as lumps of metal go, but is a complete pussycat next to its muscled-up brothers, the Land Cruiser Colorado and the Land Cruiser Amazon, whose bumpers reach up to your eyebrows. It comes in two models - a cute and snubby three-door version, and, for rappers with larger entourages, a five-door version. </p> <p>The five-door was the model I drove, and it was also, naturally, a five-wheel car, in the sense that there was a fifth wheel stuck prominently to the outside of the back door. Conspicuous tyre display is, for some reason, the staple of the SUV, the size and prominence of the spare being almost the measure of the car. All that canny work that designers once did, creating underfloor crannies to hide the spare, is ritually mocked by the SUV. </p> <p>In publicity photographs, the RAV4 is poised, not on somebody's drive or outside a childrens' shoe shop, but on the lip of a gushing waterfall. One gets the impression that the target RAV4 owner would have to miss an awful lot of road signs before life got as wild as that. </p> <p>Still, even in the suburbs, there are tough jobs to be done by tough men in tough vehicles, and last week I did such a job in a Toyota RAV4. Throwing caution to the wind, I gunned the two-litre engine and drove to Sainsbury's Homebase to buy a lawnmower. </p> <p>Funny time of the year to be buying a lawnmower, I concede. But then, this year time does seem to have gone funny - the leaves still sticking to the trees, the grass still growing. Anyway, I needed a new machine for a final, pre-winter cut - and I had a RAV4 on hand to help me score one. </p> <p>I was there in no time, because the RAV4 is extremely fast. Toyota claim it offers the best power-to-weight ratio in its class. I could perhaps have done with some more weight, finding the steering wispy and the car faintly frail-feeling. I wouldn't fancy it over mountains or down waterfalls, but I have to say it managed with aplomb the rumble strips on the Homebase car park feeder road. </p> <p>It also nipped easily into a parking space. Regular SUVs tend to need two. The Flymo Turbo Compact 330 I eventually selected was quite a handful - both in boxed form and also, as I later discovered, as an electric mayhem-maker, out there on the lawn - but thanks to the RAV4's dual-position luggage cover, it slotted without complaint into the boot. (And without me having to remove the back seats - though I could have done, had I for some reason been buying several lawnmowers.) </p> <p>I found reverse, eased my spare tyre out into the exit lane and headed smoothly for the one-way system. And then I drove home, very fast, to mow the lawn. </p> <p>So there you have it: usefulness and sportiness in the same concise, affordable package. But enough about the Flymo. The Toyota RAV4? It's a mixed-up kid. But someone's going to love it. </p> <p><strong> The lowdown</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Toyota RAV4 </strong></p> <p><strong>Price: </strong> from \u00a313,495 </p> <p><strong> Top speed: </strong> 115 mph (2.0, manual) </p> <p><strong> Acceleration: </strong> 0-62 in 10.6 secs </p> <p><strong> Consumption: </strong> 32.1 mpg (combined) </p> <p><strong> On the stereo: </strong> Puff Daddy </p> <p><strong> At the wheel: </strong> Puff Daddy's daddy </p> <p><strong> En route for: </strong> downtown Stevenage</p>",

      "bodyText": "Car design works in reverse. The more a vehicle is made to look rugged and ready for that all-night, cross-mountain trek over gravel, ice and the carcasses of dead sheep, the more likely it is to earn a strictly urban cachet and be unlikely to be called upon for so much as a hill-start. This certainly seems to be the story with the sports utility vehicle, or SUV. The snazzier models are what today's ram raider or rap star is wearing uptown at the weekend. The ones with the quieter boom boxes are for urban or suburban people who have families but want to insist that this hasn't entirely exhausted their appetite for life. In either form, the SUV has dealt a blow to the pride of the hatchback, which used to do well by both these social groups but which these days looks timid and grey-complexioned beside these pumped-up, rounded-off bundles of energy. Sports utility - it's a boldly yoked concept. What \"sports\" means in these circumstances is surprisingly fast engines, stiff suspensions and the ability to get airborne at speed bumps. What \"utility\" seems to mean, however, is, actually, \"inutility\", in the sense that the cars tend to come generously decked with features for which the average urban owner will have little or no use, such as chunky anti-rhino bars, rear storage spaces the size of horse boxes, and four-wheel drives. But what, then, are we to make of the compact SUV? Regular SUVs are, generally, the kind of car you can walk into without ducking and they appeal to the consumer whose desire is to own an extremely large lump of metal. The idea, then, of a deliberately compact one is necessarily hedged about with contradictions, but the vehicle must presumably be aimed at people who want to own an extremely large lump of metal but who don't quite have the heart or the driveway to carry it through. The Toyota RAV4 is a compact SUV. Toyota pretty much invented this concept-within-a-concept six years ago, with the original RAV4, and are now revisiting it. The new model is tall and roomy and fairly big, as lumps of metal go, but is a complete pussycat next to its muscled-up brothers, the Land Cruiser Colorado and the Land Cruiser Amazon, whose bumpers reach up to your eyebrows. It comes in two models - a cute and snubby three-door version, and, for rappers with larger entourages, a five-door version. The five-door was the model I drove, and it was also, naturally, a five-wheel car, in the sense that there was a fifth wheel stuck prominently to the outside of the back door. Conspicuous tyre display is, for some reason, the staple of the SUV, the size and prominence of the spare being almost the measure of the car. All that canny work that designers once did, creating underfloor crannies to hide the spare, is ritually mocked by the SUV. In publicity photographs, the RAV4 is poised, not on somebody's drive or outside a childrens' shoe shop, but on the lip of a gushing waterfall. One gets the impression that the target RAV4 owner would have to miss an awful lot of road signs before life got as wild as that. Still, even in the suburbs, there are tough jobs to be done by tough men in tough vehicles, and last week I did such a job in a Toyota RAV4. Throwing caution to the wind, I gunned the two-litre engine and drove to Sainsbury's Homebase to buy a lawnmower. Funny time of the year to be buying a lawnmower, I concede. But then, this year time does seem to have gone funny - the leaves still sticking to the trees, the grass still growing. Anyway, I needed a new machine for a final, pre-winter cut - and I had a RAV4 on hand to help me score one. I was there in no time, because the RAV4 is extremely fast. Toyota claim it offers the best power-to-weight ratio in its class. I could perhaps have done with some more weight, finding the steering wispy and the car faintly frail-feeling. I wouldn't fancy it over mountains or down waterfalls, but I have to say it managed with aplomb the rumble strips on the Homebase car park feeder road. It also nipped easily into a parking space. Regular SUVs tend to need two. The Flymo Turbo Compact 330 I eventually selected was quite a handful - both in boxed form and also, as I later discovered, as an electric mayhem-maker, out there on the lawn - but thanks to the RAV4's dual-position luggage cover, it slotted without complaint into the boot. (And without me having to remove the back seats - though I could have done, had I for some reason been buying several lawnmowers.) I found reverse, eased my spare tyre out into the exit lane and headed smoothly for the one-way system. And then I drove home, very fast, to mow the lawn. So there you have it: usefulness and sportiness in the same concise, affordable package. But enough about the Flymo. The Toyota RAV4? It's a mixed-up kid. But someone's going to love it. The lowdown Toyota RAV4 Price: from \u00a313,495 Top speed: 115 mph (2.0, manual) Acceleration: 0-62 in 10.6 secs Consumption: 32.1 mpg (combined) On the stereo: Puff Daddy At the wheel: Puff Daddy's daddy En route for: downtown Stevenage",

      "body": "<p>Before the dogs of war were unleashed in this Merseyside derby, the focal point for the ritualistic bloodletting was the young man who famously declared he couldn't understand what all the fuss was about when he swapped blue for red last summer. </p> <p>Nick Barmby's butter-wouldn't-melt features had a slightly grey hue to them as frightful, spiteful abuse rolled down from around a stadium which was so enveloped by emotion that, at times, it seemed fit to burst. He was, however, to have if not the day's final word then a major say in the outcome. </p> <p>Barmby's opener was a curious goal, for while his flying header was beautifully executed, the manner of the ball's delivery into his path was fortuitous, Christian Ziege's shot clipping Abel Xavier and looping high into the slate-grey skies. </p> <p>\"He was very professional. It was a special day and it has not been easy for him,\" said the Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier of his \u00a36m man. </p> <p>\"As soon as his chance came I knew he would score, I just told him to keep focused.\" </p> <p>All that was missing from this encounter was the kitchen sink and fittingly it was in the midst of a downpour that the tide was finally turned on Merseyside. </p> <p>After emerging victorious from just one of their 12 previous league meetings with their neighbours, Liverpool fashioned a win which keeps them treading on the coat-tails of the Premiership's leading pair. </p> <p>The home side played marginally better than they had three days earlier against the Czech minnows of Slovan Liberec, but that observation merely damns them with faint praise. There was an improvement, particularly as the afternoon wore on, but, in truth, the gap between Liverpool's performances and their potential is still frustratingly wide. </p> <p>Either side of Barmby's opener, two of Everton's early chances fell not to Kevin Campbell or to Paul Gascoigne but to Mark Pembridge, a tenacious-enough midfielder but a man who has never really mastered the art of clinical finishing.</p> <p>After five minutes Pembridge somehow contrived to lift the ball well wide of the far post when only the goalkeeper Sander Westerveld stood in his way. Then eight minutes later he inexplicably hooked wide. </p> <p>But a sense of meaningful perspective was returned to the afternoon on 17 minutes when Everton's tidy football was finally rewarded, Campbell turning home from close range after David Weir had been allowed to turn an Idan Tal corner back across the face of goal. </p> <p>That nicely worked goal was to represent the summit of Everton's achievement, for the limitations of what is a thin and depleted squad were particularly evident in a second half which Liverpool dominated with such ease that it made their first-half contribution all the more unpalatable.</p> <p>Once Emile Heskey had claimed a sixth goal in four games - a powerful low drive which skipped off a sodden surface - Liverpool were all but home.</p> <p>The frantically paced football which had sustained Everton began to slacken off, Dietmar Hamann finally began to match the superb Gascoigne in central midfield and the pendulum had swung, decisively so. </p> <p>It got worse for Everton. With 13 minutes remaining, substitute Gary Naysmith failed to intercept Westerveld's long clearance and Vladimir Smicer's run on goal was only ended by Thomas Gravesen's illegal tackle. Gravesen, the best player on the pitch by some distance, was sent off and Patrik Berger rifled home the resultant penalty to end all the arguments. </p> <p>Houllier viewed Heskey's goal as the game's turning point. \"The lad is only 22 and I believe he can become a truly great goalscorer in the future,\" he beamed. </p> <p>But the Everton manager Walter Smith was unhappy with his side's defeat. </p> <p>\"We started well, and in the first half we should have been in front. We created our best opportunities but we were unable to maintain that level throughout.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Before the dogs of war were unleashed in this Merseyside derby, the focal point for the ritualistic bloodletting was the young man who famously declared he couldn't understand what all the fuss was about when he swapped blue for red last summer. Nick Barmby's butter-wouldn't-melt features had a slightly grey hue to them as frightful, spiteful abuse rolled down from around a stadium which was so enveloped by emotion that, at times, it seemed fit to burst. He was, however, to have if not the day's final word then a major say in the outcome. Barmby's opener was a curious goal, for while his flying header was beautifully executed, the manner of the ball's delivery into his path was fortuitous, Christian Ziege's shot clipping Abel Xavier and looping high into the slate-grey skies. \"He was very professional. It was a special day and it has not been easy for him,\" said the Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier of his \u00a36m man. \"As soon as his chance came I knew he would score, I just told him to keep focused.\" All that was missing from this encounter was the kitchen sink and fittingly it was in the midst of a downpour that the tide was finally turned on Merseyside. After emerging victorious from just one of their 12 previous league meetings with their neighbours, Liverpool fashioned a win which keeps them treading on the coat-tails of the Premiership's leading pair. The home side played marginally better than they had three days earlier against the Czech minnows of Slovan Liberec, but that observation merely damns them with faint praise. There was an improvement, particularly as the afternoon wore on, but, in truth, the gap between Liverpool's performances and their potential is still frustratingly wide. Either side of Barmby's opener, two of Everton's early chances fell not to Kevin Campbell or to Paul Gascoigne but to Mark Pembridge, a tenacious-enough midfielder but a man who has never really mastered the art of clinical finishing. After five minutes Pembridge somehow contrived to lift the ball well wide of the far post when only the goalkeeper Sander Westerveld stood in his way. Then eight minutes later he inexplicably hooked wide. But a sense of meaningful perspective was returned to the afternoon on 17 minutes when Everton's tidy football was finally rewarded, Campbell turning home from close range after David Weir had been allowed to turn an Idan Tal corner back across the face of goal. That nicely worked goal was to represent the summit of Everton's achievement, for the limitations of what is a thin and depleted squad were particularly evident in a second half which Liverpool dominated with such ease that it made their first-half contribution all the more unpalatable. Once Emile Heskey had claimed a sixth goal in four games - a powerful low drive which skipped off a sodden surface - Liverpool were all but home. The frantically paced football which had sustained Everton began to slacken off, Dietmar Hamann finally began to match the superb Gascoigne in central midfield and the pendulum had swung, decisively so. It got worse for Everton. With 13 minutes remaining, substitute Gary Naysmith failed to intercept Westerveld's long clearance and Vladimir Smicer's run on goal was only ended by Thomas Gravesen's illegal tackle. Gravesen, the best player on the pitch by some distance, was sent off and Patrik Berger rifled home the resultant penalty to end all the arguments. Houllier viewed Heskey's goal as the game's turning point. \"The lad is only 22 and I believe he can become a truly great goalscorer in the future,\" he beamed. But the Everton manager Walter Smith was unhappy with his side's defeat. \"We started well, and in the first half we should have been in front. We created our best opportunities but we were unable to maintain that level throughout.\"",

This has long been the view of the wiser press commentators, but it has usually been accompanied by shrugs and the shaking of heads. After all, it just wouldn't be plausible, would it? </p> <p>The government would never wear it. The competition commission would outlaw it. The media ownership rules could not be stretched to accommodate it. The idea was out of the question. Now the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (DMGT) has turned the notion from a hypothetical dream into reality. Its bid for its century-old rival is very serious indeed, and it has not allowed the news to slip into the public domain without having a strategy to overcome both the political and commercial hurdles. </p> <p>Let's consider how Lord Rothermere's team will jump them, with a little help from a usually reliable DMGT source. First, the problem probably uppermost in the mind of Tony Blair and his press secretary, Alastair Campbell, not to mention Labour politicians up and down the land, is the danger of the Express adopting an aggressive rightwing stance similar to the Mail's. </p> <p>It would, of course, be foolish for the Mail to publish a quasi-Mail. I understand that DMGT has been impressed with the response to its apolitical, non-ideological morning giveaway paper, the Metro, and would seek to transform the Express into a more neutral, less politically committed, paper. </p> <p>Some Mail executives believe this reflects the times in which we live. The central argument over the economy has been settled in favour of free-market capitalism so the differences between parties are now largely matters of degree. Young readers, the ones most sought by all papers, are no longer interested in political arguments. </p> <p>But the company would not change the Express instantly, giving a guarantee that its current political viewpoint, which is broadly pro-Labour, if occasionally critical, would be maintained up to at least the next general election. This would also mean that, if she wished, editor Rosie Boycott could remain in place with her senior team. She would therefore be in a position to assess whether she wished to stay on to oversee the paper's gradual transformation. </p> <p>My DMGT source also stressed that, apart from the Daily Mail, the wider Associated Newspapers stable is not noted for running Tory-supporting, rightwing papers. Some of the provincial evenings, he suggested, even support Labour. </p> <p>I raised my eyebrows at that, just as I did when he claimed that the Mail on Sunday \"doesn't really have a rightwing agenda\". In fairness, the London Evening Standard has often found itself lining up on the side of New Labour, and Metro has eschewed any political line. Associated's sprawling, pluralistic media operations also include Teletext which certainly has an ethos of impartiality. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see whether Blair and Campbell accept this viewpoint, but it wouldn't surprise me if they did, because they will be pleased with the pledge about the Express's stance leading up to the election. </p> <p>They will doubtless want to feel confident in the composition of the editorial board of independent directors which DMGT says it will appoint to ensure that its promises are kept. What then of the commercial argument? No one, even those of us who disparage the Daily Mail's social and political agenda, can deny that the paper is Fleet Street's most efficient and best-resourced editorial operation. Its investment in journalism and commitment to technical excellence have made it the best popular paper since Hugh Cudlipp's Daily Mirror of the 1950s and 60s. </p> <p>So it comes as no surprise that DMGT will promise to invest \u00a350m a year for five years in the Express titles. The company knows that ever since Lord Beaverbrook's demise in 1964 the titles have suffered from continual cuts which have eaten away at their ability to compete. Over the years I would estimate that DMGT spent \u00a3100m on the Mail on Sunday before it came into profit, and the Metro investment has been high too. It therefore has a track record of spending, it has the money and, more importantly, it has been given the will to succeed by the young Lord Rothermere and his editor-in-chief Paul Dacre. </p> <p>Dacre - who joined the Express from university in the 70s and eventually became its US correspondent before the Mail poached him - has always believed that there is an audience for the paper and his sadness at its decline has been genuine. There is no question of the Mail doing to the Express what it did to the News Chronicle in 1960. In other words, this is not a ploy designed to kill off the Express by \"merging\" it with the Mail. </p> <p>It would appear from its investment pledge that it is giving the Express at least five years to find its footing, which is about as good as it gets for a paper which is no longer turning a profit. Research by DMGT, especially among readers of the Metro, suggests there is a big untapped market among young people requiring crisp, impartial news. (I must register a cavil here since I don't believe any news is impartial, but it's their argument, not mine). </p> <p>Then there is the Daily Star. Again, DMGT promises not to shut it but to expand and strengthen the paper. It is viewed as a fine platform from which to build a red-top targeted more purposefully at the Mirror and the Sun. </p> <p>This, incidentally, is a very shrewd move for the Mail. The Star surprised its rivals by doing well in the first three years after its 1978 launch but lost its way. If it could be revived, the Sun and Mirror - which have both sought to move upmarket to confront the Mail - would have to watch their flanks. </p> <p>There is, needless to say, a strong back-office argument in favour of the deal. Way back, when Lord Stevens was running the Express titles, his managing director, Andy Cameron, had a series of meetings with the then managing director of Associated Newspapers, Bert Hardy, to discuss ways of merging the titles' printing, distribution, newsprint-buying and, possibly, other facilities. </p> <p>Both men realised there could be tremendous savings, but Rothermere and Stevens, for personal reasons which were never clear, eventually balked at the idea. </p> <p>Since then, the Telegraph group has been running a 50-50 joint publishing operation with the Express's owners, United News &amp; Media. That is just one of the many wrinkles DMGT would need to iron out before trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers is called on to make one of the most delicate political decisions of his career: should he allow the Daily Mail to own the Daily Express?</p>",

But the company would not change the Express instantly, giving a guarantee that its current political viewpoint, which is broadly pro-Labour, if occasionally critical, would be maintained up to at least the next general election. This would also mean that, if she wished, editor Rosie Boycott could remain in place with her senior team. She would therefore be in a position to assess whether she wished to stay on to oversee the paper's gradual transformation. My DMGT source also stressed that, apart from the Daily Mail, the wider Associated Newspapers stable is not noted for running Tory-supporting, rightwing papers. Some of the provincial evenings, he suggested, even support Labour. I raised my eyebrows at that, just as I did when he claimed that the Mail on Sunday \"doesn't really have a rightwing agenda\". In fairness, the London Evening Standard has often found itself lining up on the side of New Labour, and Metro has eschewed any political line. Associated's sprawling, pluralistic media operations also include Teletext which certainly has an ethos of impartiality. It will be interesting to see whether Blair and Campbell accept this viewpoint, but it wouldn't surprise me if they did, because they will be pleased with the pledge about the Express's stance leading up to the election. They will doubtless want to feel confident in the composition of the editorial board of independent directors which DMGT says it will appoint to ensure that its promises are kept. What then of the commercial argument? No one, even those of us who disparage the Daily Mail's social and political agenda, can deny that the paper is Fleet Street's most efficient and best-resourced editorial operation. Its investment in journalism and commitment to technical excellence have made it the best popular paper since Hugh Cudlipp's Daily Mirror of the 1950s and 60s. So it comes as no surprise that DMGT will promise to invest \u00a350m a year for five years in the Express titles. The company knows that ever since Lord Beaverbrook's demise in 1964 the titles have suffered from continual cuts which have eaten away at their ability to compete. Over the years I would estimate that DMGT spent \u00a3100m on the Mail on Sunday before it came into profit, and the Metro investment has been high too. It therefore has a track record of spending, it has the money and, more importantly, it has been given the will to succeed by the young Lord Rothermere and his editor-in-chief Paul Dacre. Dacre - who joined the Express from university in the 70s and eventually became its US correspondent before the Mail poached him - has always believed that there is an audience for the paper and his sadness at its decline has been genuine. There is no question of the Mail doing to the Express what it did to the News Chronicle in 1960. In other words, this is not a ploy designed to kill off the Express by \"merging\" it with the Mail. It would appear from its investment pledge that it is giving the Express at least five years to find its footing, which is about as good as it gets for a paper which is no longer turning a profit. Research by DMGT, especially among readers of the Metro, suggests there is a big untapped market among young people requiring crisp, impartial news. (I must register a cavil here since I don't believe any news is impartial, but it's their argument, not mine). Then there is the Daily Star. Again, DMGT promises not to shut it but to expand and strengthen the paper. It is viewed as a fine platform from which to build a red-top targeted more purposefully at the Mirror and the Sun. This, incidentally, is a very shrewd move for the Mail. The Star surprised its rivals by doing well in the first three years after its 1978 launch but lost its way. If it could be revived, the Sun and Mirror - which have both sought to move upmarket to confront the Mail - would have to watch their flanks. There is, needless to say, a strong back-office argument in favour of the deal. Way back, when Lord Stevens was running the Express titles, his managing director, Andy Cameron, had a series of meetings with the then managing director of Associated Newspapers, Bert Hardy, to discuss ways of merging the titles' printing, distribution, newsprint-buying and, possibly, other facilities. Both men realised there could be tremendous savings, but Rothermere and Stevens, for personal reasons which were never clear, eventually balked at the idea. Since then, the Telegraph group has been running a 50-50 joint publishing operation with the Express's owners, United News &amp; Media. That is just one of the many wrinkles DMGT would need to iron out before trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers is called on to make one of the most delicate political decisions of his career: should he allow the Daily Mail to own the Daily Express?",

Some people who could correct our interpretations of events refuse to talk to us.

However hard we strive to eliminate them, they occur. </p> <p>Indeed, in my column last week, I made two stupid errors, which were nobody's fault but my own. They necessitated an apology, which was published within days. So why should the Sunday Times's apology be considered differently? For a start, note the length of time between the publication of the story and its appearance: four months. Note also that it wasn't a case of the story being generally right and containing an unfortunate error or two: it was wholly inaccurate from start to finish because its central, substantive assertion was incorrect. </p> <p>More worrying still are the events leading up to the publication of the apology, and the use of what might be viewed as a tactic in dealing with the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) and could well undermine the whole self-regulatory process. After spending a month failing to obtain a retraction and apology from the Sunday Times, St James's Palace made a formal complaint to the PCC on July 14. The Church of Scotland was content with the fact that Scottish papers carried denials and that its moderator issued an unequivocal rebuttal during a Radio 5 Live interview. Even so, the church tacitly supported the palace's complaint. </p> <p>When I originally challenged the Sunday Times's reporter, Christopher Morgan, and an executive about its story, I was told that I had been unduly influenced by palace spin-doctors.

As for the church's denial, the paper claimed that the moderator had told a religious journal that a Scottish marriage for the Prince could not be ruled out. This answer struck me as an obvious piece of wriggling. What else could the moderator say? If I was to write that the editor of the Sunday Times, John Witherow, was \"exploring\" the possibility of becoming editor of the Times and had held \"secret discussions\" with News International executives, would he and they find it acceptable if I refused to apologise because - despite it being utterly false - it couldn't be ruled out? </p> <p>But back to events once the PCC started its inquiries. After the usual exchanges of letters and documents, in which the paper continued to stress the veracity of its anonymous source, the PCC concluded that its evidence was not as convincing as that from the palace and the church. Following normal procedure, it urged the paper to publish a correction. The Sunday Times refused to do so and, fearing the worst with an adjudication looming, took a number of extraordinary steps to try to justify its story. </p> <p>Two of the Queen's chaplains were called by Morgan, who tape-recorded interviews with them. However hard Morgan tried, he could not get either man to provide the least indication that his original story had been true. Yet the paper offered selected quotes from these interviews as \"evidence\" to the PCC. What the Sunday Times could not do, of course, was reveal its source. But it became clear that the paper itself might not know the person either because the information came to it second-hand. </p> <p>With the Sunday Times still refusing to budge, the commission decided to adjudicate. Its 16 members, including seven editors, agreed on what I understand to have been a lengthy and detailed document which condemned the paper for publishing the story, for refusing to accept that it was wrong and, given those circumstances, refusing to publish an apology. Witherow may have got wind of the adjudication, or he may have begun to get cold feet about Morgan. Whatever the case, he could not face publishing a full adjudication critical of his paper, and days before it was due to be made public, he capitulated and published the apology. </p> <p>Although he may not see it in such terms, Witherow and the Sunday Times have discovered a disturbing loophole in the system of self-regulation which requires careful consideration by the industry. In future, if any paper realises that a PCC judgment is about to go against it, it can avoid the humiliation of publishing the results of an impartial inquiry into its behaviour - not to mention the black mark on its record - by making a belated apology. It can guarantee that the apology will not be prominent and that the relatively few readers drawn to it will wonder what the fuss was about because it all happened so long ago. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the PCC's adjudication will go into the shredder. We will never know exactly what Witherow's peers thought of his story. In effect, he has got away with it. When the commission's quarterly report comes out, the case will be blandly said to have been \"amicably resolved between the two parties\". </p> <p>But that brings me to my final point about journalistic errors. Some don't really deserve to be called mistakes because they aren't entirely accidental. They can sometimes be reckless. They occur because the writer and/or the paper are stimulated by some kind of agenda to carry on with the story regardless of the error. I just wonder whether that could have been the case on this occasion? If there is any good to come from this close call for Witherow and his reporter, it will be their realisation that the paper's reputation is at stake and they must clean up their act. </p> <p>Now we must closely watch the progress of the complaint by Lord Levy, who claims that the Sunday Times broke the editors' code of practice when writing about his tax affairs. Will it dare to employ the same kind of brinkmanship used to foil the palace?</p>",

When the commission's quarterly report comes out, the case will be blandly said to have been \"amicably resolved between the two parties\". But that brings me to my final point about journalistic errors. Some don't really deserve to be called mistakes because they aren't entirely accidental. They can sometimes be reckless. They occur because the writer and/or the paper are stimulated by some kind of agenda to carry on with the story regardless of the error. I just wonder whether that could have been the case on this occasion? If there is any good to come from this close call for Witherow and his reporter, it will be their realisation that the paper's reputation is at stake and they must clean up their act. Now we must closely watch the progress of the complaint by Lord Levy, who claims that the Sunday Times broke the editors' code of practice when writing about his tax affairs. Will it dare to employ the same kind of brinkmanship used to foil the palace?",

      "body": "<b>Who wants to buy the Express?</b> <br> With the Daily Mail's owners, the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), in the running, there appear to be four serious contenders. Up to now, only the Barclay brothers have made a bid - of between \u00a375m and \u00a3100m - which was last month rejected by United News and Media, the owners of the Express. David and Frederick Barclay's Press Holdings, publishers of the Scotsman and Sunday Business, announced the \"matter is now closed\" for them but it could be a tactical withdrawal and they are likely to be still gauging developments. Brothers Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja, wealthy, London-based Indian businessmen, have revealed their interest in recent weeks, after the Barclays' bid broke down. They are reportedly poised to name a management team to demonstrate their seriousness about a formal \u00a3100m offer. The Telegraph Group, who share the Westferry printing plant in London's Docklands with the Express, are also interested, motivated by the ambition of building a newspaper group to compete with News International. The last potential bidder is David Montgomery, the former Mirror Group chief executive, who is said to have secured backing from the venture capitalist group, 3i. All this interest may be surprising for what has been described as a \"deeply unloved and poorly performing\" newspaper group. However, suitors of the group see its acquisition as a way of meeting a variety of their own agendas. <p><b>Why is the Express ripe for a takeover?</b><br> The newspaper division of United News and Media barely breaks even, while the Daily Mail's rise has been seemingly inexorable, with its editorial standards, if not its social and political agenda, held in great esteem. The Daily Express - United's century-old flagship title - once sold 4m copies a day and now hovers above 1m. It has been partially relying on its sister paper, the tiny-staffed Daily Star, which would turn a profit on its own but has been bearing a disproportionate share of the group's costs. However, United's coffers have been boosted by the sale of its ITV licenses. This revenue, alongside that from the Star, gives Lord Hollick, United's chief executive, space to tease out the most lucrative bid. He is said to be holding out for \u00a3150m and only an auction with very interested parties is going to achieve that. The Barclay brothers pulled out after reports they were unhappy at \"foot dragging\" from United on disclosing their \"labyrinthine accounts\". A source close to the famously secretive brothers claimed that Lord Hollick has put the bid in his back pocket and is waiting for it to be upped. This, the source claimed, has angered the brothers, who feel they have been used. </p> <p><b>How seriously should we take the Mail's interest?</b><br> Very. They have the cash, the expertise, and apparently, the will. It appears on the surface to be an absurd proposition but as the Guardian's newspaper expert Roy Greenslade declares, \"If anyone can save the Daily Express the Daily Mail can.\" Viscount Rothermere, the chairman of the Daily Mail, is said to be keen to enter an auction and believes he would have a good case to take to the competition commission. DMGT is reportedly considering pouring up to \u00a350m a year into a revamped Daily Express for the next five years. </p> <p><b>What would the Mail gain?</b><br> The casual observer would be forgiven for thinking the Daily Mail would be interested in buying its middle market rival to \"merge\" the operations, a euphemism for taking it out of the race. The Express itself did this to the News Chronicle in 1960. However, the word coming from the DMGT is that this is far from the case. Internal research is said to have pointed out an untapped market of much sought after young readers who want quality but politically impartial news. DMGT is said to be impressed by the response of its apolitical and non-ideological morning free newspaper, Metro. A source at DMGT told the Guardian that its plan is to have a separate editorial board for the Express and that senior figures at the paper, including editor Rosie Boycott, could stay to see in the transfer. There is talk of \"guaranteed independence\". This is a crucial point because it would help appease the government on the suitability of the move. Ms Boycott has reshaped the Express as a broadly pro-Labour newspaper, so there is bound to be government concern at the Mail group transforming the Express into something approaching their right-wing mid-market tabloid. However, insiders at the Mail group have pointed out that the London Evening Standard, which the Mail also owns, has pro-Blair tendencies and that some of its local evening titles are openly Labour supporting. DMGT is said to want to give the Express five years to find its feet financially. </p> <p><b>Would the competition commission allow the Mail's takeover of the Express?</b><br> Any newspaper sale automatically is referred and this is likely to be one of the \"exceptional circumstances\" where the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, is left to rule on the outcome. However, previous investigations into the newspaper market have tended to look at the total national newspaper market in assessing competition issues. This fact bolsters the Mail's case. It will be able to argue that the Daily Mail and Express newspapers combined would deliver roughly 25% market share of the national market, compared with more than 30% at News International, which owns the Sunday Times, the Times, the Sun, and the News of the World. The success of the bid may hinge on the detail of promises made to retain Labour sympathies at least until after the next general election. But competition commission rulings take a long time and, with the Mail and the Telegraph yet to formally make bids, there could be plenty of twists and turns before the destiny of the Express is settled. </p> <p><b>What about the Telegraph: how serious is it?</b><br> Difficult to tell. There are obvious production, business and advertising synergies which would be agreeable to the paper. The future of the shared Westferry printing press, which accounted for half of the Express newspapers' \u00a310m profits last year, would be the Telegraph's to determine. Again, though, there are political considerations. Dan Colson, deputy chairman of Hollinger, the Telegraph's parent company, has said that he favours returning the Express to its traditionally conservative values. In clinching any deal, Conrad Black and the young Lord Rothmere have the advantage of being able to put the Express titles into existing stables of papers. On the other hand, the Hinduja brothers, thought to want the Express as a prestige asset, could argue that their purchase of the papers has no negative competition dynamics.</p> <p><b>Useful link</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com\">MediaGuardian</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com/presspublishing/comment/0,7495,389873,00.html\">30 October: Roy Greenslade on how the Mail could save the Express</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com/presspublishing/story/0,7495,388712,00.html\">27 October: Hinduja brothers firm up Express offer</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com/presspublishing/story/0,7495,388434,00.html\">26 October: Barclay brothers withdraw Express bid</a></p>",

It would be hard to cock it up. \"It is one of the best portfolios,\" admits Ainsworth with a smile. </p> <p>It is not, however, easy to take a Tory culture spokesman seriously. In government, the Conservatives' broadcasting legacy was the discredited auction system that turned ITV into a free-for-all for the highest bidder. Successive national heritage secretaries were lambasted for being ineffectual (think Stephen Dorrell and Virginia Bottomley). And the Broadcasting Standards Commission, set up as a sop to the right-wing clean-up campaigners, has turned out to be a toothless tiger. Arts groups remember the Tories for slashing arts spending - even though it was the Conservative government that set up the national lottery. The one consolation is that the Tories at least enjoy plenty of friends in the press. </p> <p>So when Ainsworth was appointed to the brief after the last election, he had a hard task ahead of him. He could have just made a name for himself by providing handy quotes to the Daily Mail when it gets outraged about Channel 5 (and he has done his fair share of that), and wait until something better comes along. </p> <p>But, instead, Ainsworth has quietly been doing the rounds of the media circles. He is known to all the major broadcasters and lunches newspaper editors.

(There's a photocopy of the Sun's mocking front page the day after Greg Dyke was appointed to the BBC on his wall.) He enthuses about My Family, the BBC sitcom that has debuted to mixed reviews (\"very high-quality comedy\"), Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? (\"great theatre\"), and, of course: \"I became addicted to Big Brother. And yes, I voted.\" So did he go for Scouse builder Craig, or lesbian former nun Anna? \"I was one of the 49%.\" An Anna man, then. </p> <p>So that takes care of BBC, ITV and Channel 4. What about Channel 5, which he condemned as \"gross\" in the Mail earlier this year after it exposed Keith Chegwin's bodily parts to an undeserving public? He makes the right noises about protecting children, but adds: \"Well, you can switch it off. You don't have to watch it.\" </p> <p>Suddenly, he swaps his smooth Oxford-educated received pronunciation for a mock-south London accent to imitate a constituent who complained about the channel. \"He said to me, 'It's absolute filth innit, it goes on all night.' I replied, 'You don't have to watch it, there is the off button.

It's not surprising: for the Conservatives, the corporation has always been a handy whipping boy. Full of pinko liberal subversives, it was a corrosive source of counter-revolutionary thought that had to be stamped on at all costs. The arrival of Dyke as director-general appeared to confirm that view. William Hague demanded that his appointment be blocked, and cries of \"Labour stooge\" went up as soon as he was confirmed in the post. Now, however, Dyke presents something of a problem for politicians of the right. In moving the Nine o'Clock News to 10pm with such haste, he has incurred the wrath of Smith. In slashing management costs, he has shown himself to be a shrewd businessman. And in showing a determination to increase the BBC's revenue from external sources, he has displayed a commercial eye that was lacking in the previous regime. </p> <p>Hence, a marked change in tune from the Tories. \"Greg is a highly commercial individual,\" says Ainsworth. \"To his core he is a commercial operator. That has merits. It's a breath of fresh air, a management style that's welcomed. He's an engaging guy, all that is good. What gives some cause for concern is that there is a degree of impetuousness which we saw with the sudden decision to bring forward the move of the news. That was a highly commercial thing to do.\" </p> <p>But Ainsworth doubts whether the commercialism of Dyke is necessarily a good thing for the corporation. \"Is there going to be a culture clash between the BBC as an institution and a man who is so entrepreneurial?\" </p> <p>So far, so reasonable. Many in the BBC would say the same thing. But lest we be in any doubt, Ainsworth calls back later after thinking about what he has said.

I wouldn't want to give the impression that I think everything is rosy in the garden.\" </p> <p>During his interview, in his cramped offices at Millbank, he expresses serious concerns about the ratings-driven strategy that appears to have been adopted by Dyke, Mark Thompson and Lorraine Heggessey at the BBC. While he acknowledges that BBC1 must continue to be popular if the argument for the licence fee (which he supports) is to be sustained, he believes that the corporation has over-stepped the mark. Moving the news was \"opportunistic\". And it calls into question the role of the BBC governors, and the whole way in which the BBC - and the rest of the broadcasting industry - is regulated. </p> <p>While he says that \"any new parliamentary measures should be as profoundly deregulatory as humanly possible\", he agrees with the commercial sector's argument that the corporation should be brought under an overarching broadcasting regulator.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you read any papers besides the Guardian, the Times and the FT you will no doubt have recently spotted one of several full-page colour ads for MegaStar, the Daily Star's website. Carried in titles including the Telegraph, the Independent and the London Evening Standard, the ads have featured a variety of topless women covering up their ample curves with large placards. These have carried a range of straight news headlines such as \"Aptitude tests aid entry to elite academic institutions\" and \"Polo aims to be populist not elitist sport, says lord\". </p> <p>This somewhat unlikely juxtaposition of nudity with rather posh news has been aimed at highlighting the fact that MegaStar offers online users \"visionary and definitive sports analysis\" and even \"in-depth news and current affairs\" as well as, erm, the rather more colourful, titillating fare of scantily-clad women. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, several broadsheets have refused to carry them, some no doubt worrying about eyebrows being raised in Milton Keynes and bulging postbags. </p> <p>But this is not unusual - newspapers and magazines often reject one-off ads and even whole campaigns. While TV stations cannot make independent decisions on what commercials to allow (all TV ads are pre-vetted by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre), individual print media organisations have the power to decide which advertisements they want to carry - and which not. </p> <p>Gary Ward, head of communications at the Advertising Standards Authority, the print advertising watchdog which monitors complaints about ads after they have been published, explains: \"There is no equivalent of the BACC in print. There is no pre-vetting system - that would be impossible because there are over 30m print ads a year. The decision is therefore left to the discretion of the individual publishers and media owners.\" </p> <p>Aside from making sure ads are not misleading or unlawful, as laid out in the British Code of Advertising, the press mostly vet copy supplied by advertisers because they want to \"protect\" their readers and safeguard their product's reputation. This manifests itself in general issues of taste and decency - the most common reasons for ads being rejected. Kevin Brown, a partner at MegaStar's ad agency Soul, says: \"We wanted to run the ads in quality newspapers because our target audience is ABC1 men - and they read the broadsheets. We were simply using the media environment and our creative message to stand out and grab attention. The ads are not tasteless but fun, pretty harmless and very striking in that environment. It seems over the top to me that those papers refused to carry them.\" </p> <p>The Guardian maintains it rejected them \"because editorially we did not agree with the way they represented the site\". Brown says other reasons given were variations on the theme of \"they would upset our readers\" or \"the ads are too over the top for our publication\": in short, it was the naked flesh that was judged unacceptable, with one title even suggesting that if the women were put in sarongs and T-shirts they would reconsider. </p> <p>While nudity might be offensive to some papers, however, swearing can cause ructions elsewhere. A Saatchi &amp; Saatchi ad for the NSPCC in 1995 carried a picture of a clenched fist with the word \"love\" tattooed on it. The copy below read: \"The only love I ever got from my father. Bastard.\" Despite the power of this idea, the Sun refused to run the advert, loftily stating at the time: \"We are a family paper and we don't allow swearing.\" </p> <p>Cosmopolitan has also been known to take a stance against ads it perceives to be sexist. There was a Wonderbra advertisement last year featuring a girl in a Santa outfit beside the saucy line: \"The tree won't be the only thing that lights up this Xmas\". Cosmo rejected it, apparently, for belittling women. </p> <p>Chatlines or overtly sexy advertisements are also frequently outlawed. But it is most often charity ads which fall foul of the press's sense of taste and decency, largely because they depend on shocking imagery to pack their punch. </p> <p>Earlier this year, a very hard- hitting advertisement by Bartle Bogle Hegarty for Barnado's was rejected by the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday. It featured a baby sitting in a filthy room with a tourniquet round its arm, as if preparing to shoot up heroin. </p> <p>The Mail has also just thrown out the latest Barnado's advertisement which features a young boy lying lifeless beside a sawn-off shotgun outside a bank, having seemingly bungled a raid. John Teal, ad director on the newpaper, explains: \"We have carried other adverts in the campaign, but the one showing a baby jacking up and the other with a child and a shotgun were considered by the editorial department to be distasteful and unsuitable, and offensive to the readers. We have run editorial articles about the campaign but as far as these ads are concerned we decided not to carry them.\" </p> <p> Given that it is the editorial departments that tend to rule on advertisement acceptance (the ad departments being more driven to accept anyone's cash), some decisions are often simply down to the whim of an editor. He or she might want fox-hunting banned and therefore refuse to carry pro-hunting ads from the Countryside Alliance, while pro-euro or Europe advertising might be banned by, say, the Sun. </p> <p>Political ads might also be refused on the grounds that they don't fit in with editorial policy. A right-leaning paper could, for instance, refuse to carry ads for New Labour - or at least charge them a prohibitively expensive rate which effectively rules them out of appearing. </p> <p>Other moral stands are sometimes taken. The FT, for instance, unlike most other national newspapers, refuses to carry tobacco advertisements at all. </p> <p>But, perhaps most predictably, it is ads for competitive products that invariably fail to make it - if they even bother to try. Peter Barrie, display ad manager on the Telegraph, explains: \"Commercial issues could well make us refuse an ad, for instance if it was for a rival newspaper. We would probably charge ratecard, and so not do them any deal, but if it really was a direct rival like the Times we would probably turn them down altogether.\" </p> <p>The issue which most frustrates advertisers and their agencies when dealing with rejected ads is the lack of understanding and the apparent inconsistency of policy from one paper to the next - or indeed from the same publication. In the case of the MegaStar campaign, the aforementioned broadsheets refused it but it was warmly welcomed by such august journals as Legal Week, Golf International and even the Spectator.

      "bodyText": "If you read any papers besides the Guardian, the Times and the FT you will no doubt have recently spotted one of several full-page colour ads for MegaStar, the Daily Star's website. Carried in titles including the Telegraph, the Independent and the London Evening Standard, the ads have featured a variety of topless women covering up their ample curves with large placards. These have carried a range of straight news headlines such as \"Aptitude tests aid entry to elite academic institutions\" and \"Polo aims to be populist not elitist sport, says lord\". This somewhat unlikely juxtaposition of nudity with rather posh news has been aimed at highlighting the fact that MegaStar offers online users \"visionary and definitive sports analysis\" and even \"in-depth news and current affairs\" as well as, erm, the rather more colourful, titillating fare of scantily-clad women. Not surprisingly, several broadsheets have refused to carry them, some no doubt worrying about eyebrows being raised in Milton Keynes and bulging postbags. But this is not unusual - newspapers and magazines often reject one-off ads and even whole campaigns. While TV stations cannot make independent decisions on what commercials to allow (all TV ads are pre-vetted by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre), individual print media organisations have the power to decide which advertisements they want to carry - and which not. Gary Ward, head of communications at the Advertising Standards Authority, the print advertising watchdog which monitors complaints about ads after they have been published, explains: \"There is no equivalent of the BACC in print. There is no pre-vetting system - that would be impossible because there are over 30m print ads a year. The decision is therefore left to the discretion of the individual publishers and media owners.\" Aside from making sure ads are not misleading or unlawful, as laid out in the British Code of Advertising, the press mostly vet copy supplied by advertisers because they want to \"protect\" their readers and safeguard their product's reputation. This manifests itself in general issues of taste and decency - the most common reasons for ads being rejected. Kevin Brown, a partner at MegaStar's ad agency Soul, says: \"We wanted to run the ads in quality newspapers because our target audience is ABC1 men - and they read the broadsheets. We were simply using the media environment and our creative message to stand out and grab attention. The ads are not tasteless but fun, pretty harmless and very striking in that environment. It seems over the top to me that those papers refused to carry them.\" The Guardian maintains it rejected them \"because editorially we did not agree with the way they represented the site\". Brown says other reasons given were variations on the theme of \"they would upset our readers\" or \"the ads are too over the top for our publication\": in short, it was the naked flesh that was judged unacceptable, with one title even suggesting that if the women were put in sarongs and T-shirts they would reconsider. While nudity might be offensive to some papers, however, swearing can cause ructions elsewhere. A Saatchi &amp; Saatchi ad for the NSPCC in 1995 carried a picture of a clenched fist with the word \"love\" tattooed on it. The copy below read: \"The only love I ever got from my father. Bastard.\" Despite the power of this idea, the Sun refused to run the advert, loftily stating at the time: \"We are a family paper and we don't allow swearing.\" Cosmopolitan has also been known to take a stance against ads it perceives to be sexist. There was a Wonderbra advertisement last year featuring a girl in a Santa outfit beside the saucy line: \"The tree won't be the only thing that lights up this Xmas\". Cosmo rejected it, apparently, for belittling women. Chatlines or overtly sexy advertisements are also frequently outlawed. But it is most often charity ads which fall foul of the press's sense of taste and decency, largely because they depend on shocking imagery to pack their punch. Earlier this year, a very hard- hitting advertisement by Bartle Bogle Hegarty for Barnado's was rejected by the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday. It featured a baby sitting in a filthy room with a tourniquet round its arm, as if preparing to shoot up heroin. The Mail has also just thrown out the latest Barnado's advertisement which features a young boy lying lifeless beside a sawn-off shotgun outside a bank, having seemingly bungled a raid. John Teal, ad director on the newpaper, explains: \"We have carried other adverts in the campaign, but the one showing a baby jacking up and the other with a child and a shotgun were considered by the editorial department to be distasteful and unsuitable, and offensive to the readers. We have run editorial articles about the campaign but as far as these ads are concerned we decided not to carry them.\" Given that it is the editorial departments that tend to rule on advertisement acceptance (the ad departments being more driven to accept anyone's cash), some decisions are often simply down to the whim of an editor. He or she might want fox-hunting banned and therefore refuse to carry pro-hunting ads from the Countryside Alliance, while pro-euro or Europe advertising might be banned by, say, the Sun. Political ads might also be refused on the grounds that they don't fit in with editorial policy. A right-leaning paper could, for instance, refuse to carry ads for New Labour - or at least charge them a prohibitively expensive rate which effectively rules them out of appearing. Other moral stands are sometimes taken. The FT, for instance, unlike most other national newspapers, refuses to carry tobacco advertisements at all. But, perhaps most predictably, it is ads for competitive products that invariably fail to make it - if they even bother to try. Peter Barrie, display ad manager on the Telegraph, explains: \"Commercial issues could well make us refuse an ad, for instance if it was for a rival newspaper. We would probably charge ratecard, and so not do them any deal, but if it really was a direct rival like the Times we would probably turn them down altogether.\" The issue which most frustrates advertisers and their agencies when dealing with rejected ads is the lack of understanding and the apparent inconsistency of policy from one paper to the next - or indeed from the same publication. In the case of the MegaStar campaign, the aforementioned broadsheets refused it but it was warmly welcomed by such august journals as Legal Week, Golf International and even the Spectator. At the same time, the Daily Mail rejected the heroin baby but was happy to carry another Barnado's ad that featured a young girl standing like a soliciting prostitute on a street corner beside a parked car. Press editors simply take the view that it is their prerogative to accept or reject adverts, on whatever seemingly unreasonable or inconsistent grounds those might be. In general, however, they would rather be broad-minded enough to carry every ad that is booked into their publication - not least because of the financial implications of rejecting something. With a campaign of full-page colour press ads being worth as much as \u00a3500,000, they reject too much copy at their peril. Barrie concludes: \"We are extremely liberal, within the law. Why would we turn something down? It's money, and it's up to the readers. Some papers might claim an ad is in poor taste, but so is the Sun - and 4m people happily read that.\"",

Otherwise shut out of his deputy's campaign, Clinton urged vice-president Gore to watch a Saturday Night Live parody of his TV debates with his Republican rival. After first resisting, Gore acceded to Clinton's almost unerring political instinct. The tape revealed the public's perception of the candidate and his media-genic shortcomings that no pollster or focus group could have bettered. </p> <p>Clinton touched on one of the few political realities of this campaign - that TV comedy has become one of the few clarifying elements of a political discourse obfuscated by hours of punditry, spin and anti-spin. As Americans tune out from serious political coverage and analysis, they are getting more of their election news from late-night talk. A recent survey found that 47% of people aged between 18 and 29 often gleaned information from these programmes, along with a quarter of all adults. </p> <p>\"So much coverage in the main stream press is dishonest and manipulative,\" says Columbia University journalism professor Craig Wolff. \"To me, the humorists are in some ways presenting the most honest coverage.\" </p> <p>Politics as TV comedy is hardly new and has been gaining momentum since Richard Nixon appeared on the 60s show Laugh-In. What's new is just how blurred the line between politics, news and entertainment has become. Late-night comedy talk shows such as those of Jay Leno and David Letterman have become political essentials, both as barometers of how the campaigns are playing (\"If it makes it onto Leno or Letterman that really means something,\" said Gore press secretary Chris Lehane recently) and through appearances by the candidates themselves - a way of personalising their brand. </p> <p>To former Texas governor Anne Richards, it's become almost more important for candidates to show a sense of humour than to demonstrate a grasp of the issues when debating their opponents. A good joke can be incredibly effective in getting your message out, she says, \"because people repeat it\". And that's invaluable for politicians because with an electorate disenchanted with politics and an election said to hinge on a small number of swing voters, humour has become one of the few ways of gaining attention. </p> <p>\"It's a question of the different people you need to reach,\" says political columnist-turned satirist Arianna Huffington. \"There are people who already agree with you, and you can says things as flatly and blandly as you want, and they're with you. But then there are those who need to be convinced that the election matters.\" </p> <p>But while Gore has appeared on Letterman and Leno, and Bush has kissed Oprah Winfrey on Oprah, been on a morning talk show with Regis Philbin, the host of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, and had an unhappy (and un-repeated) experience on Letterman in March, none of the current crop of candidates besides Gore's democrat running mate Al Lieberman have dared venture on to The Daily Show on Comedy Central. </p> <p>The programme, hosted by Jon Stewart, has emerged as America's sharpest satire. First broadcast in 1996, The Daily Show has become one of the few programmes smart enough to come close to capturing the absurdity not just of the US political process but of the media that cover the news and the pundits that interpret and re-interpret it. </p> <p>In a show presented as a seemingly real newscast, Stewart and his team of correspondents spoof what increasingly feels like unreal news. As the 37-year-old Stewart himself liked to quip during coverage of the political conventions in the summer: \"We're a fake news organisation covering a fake news event.\" But that didn't stop the game (and very funny) senator Bob Dole appearing as the programme's deskbound political pundit, or John McCain agreeing to be interviewed by Stewart faking a real interview. </p> <p>In creating a comedy show that looks like a news broadcast, The Daily Show's formula is to satirise every element of the political process, from the pretensions of the candidates themselves to the over-heated pronouncements of pundits. </p> <p>Some is semi-subtle (Stewart explaining that when Bush says \"subliminable\" instead of subliminal, he was probably thinking of \"executing some criminables\"). Some is not. At the Republican convention a shot of Bush sitting with his wife appeared to reveal an erection. \"Welcome to the Johnson administration,\" quipped the commentary. </p> <p>Since the primaries in January The Daily Show has been covering the election as part of its nightly look at news and events. Indecision 2000, as the political segment is called, is just one part of the proceedings but one that has established the show. Stewart, who started out as a stand-up comedian, and last year made the list of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful, understands exactly what it's about: \"The longer I'm doing this I'm coming to learn that entertainment, politics and the media are really just juggling the same balls. We're all going for ratings, so we function by the same rules. What's a political poll other than a focus group for a television show?\" </p> <p>Madeleine Smithberg, co-creator of The Daily Show, dates comedy's new importance to the political process from the occassion when Clinton went on the Arsenio Hall show in 1992 and played the saxophone. \"That signalled a whole new ballgame,\" she says. \"This year there's this huge emphasis on entertainment and whether the candi dates can be funny. But it's not like they have stopped doing Sunday morning television or serious talk shows. It's just that we now have this unbelievable proliferation of media venues and everyone is just hedging their bets. Maybe they'll be showing up on sitcoms or on Millionaire. Everyone is pretending they're in it for some sort of noble motive. But we're in it for the laugh. We get to pinpoint the absurdities rampant throughout the system.\" </p> <p>There's no doubt that the constraints of US political life have played into the hands of the satirists, and that the Lewinsky affair finally stripped politics of its last vestiges of propriety. In this election - beyond Bush's aptitude for malapropisms, non-sequiturs and plain nonsense, and Gore's dull monotone - the candidates played themselves into the hands of satirists as never before by going to great lengths to say as little as possible. </p> <p>On Oprah, for instance, the hostess gave each one hour to tell the electorate how much they loved their family and name their favourite food, plus a filmed report called \"Remembering Your Spirit\" on how the Gores and the Bushes preserve the spirit of their marriages. If getting votes means appearing with a man who smashes wooden planks on his head (as Bush did on Letterman) or singing My Way (as Lieberman did on Conan O'Brian) so be it. </p> <p>\"All you really do with comedy,\" says Jay Leno, \"is clarify the news a little. Your role is to take the spin out of the story and get to the joke at its heart.\" CNN's chief political analyst Wolf Blitzer concedes that comedy now has an elevated role in the process. \"There's no doubt all this comedy has an impact,\" he told the New York Times. \"Elections are won and lost on public perception in that kind of popular culture.\" </p> <p>But as the hunt to find and win over the crucial but possibly non-existent \"undecided voter\" peaks before the November 7 vote, US comedians know they have a golden opportunity. To Smithberg, the quest for the undecided voter is itself absurd. \"It's ironic, because the undecided voter has become the most empowered voting block, and these are people who are absolutely incapable of making a decision. We've somehow given this most important decision over to the idiots who can't make a decision! We've empowered the fools.\" </p> <p>If, by some strange fluke, Smithberg's fools are also the ones who watch The Daily Show when it beams out of New York on weekday nights at 11 pm, then late-night comedy might indeed prove to be the deciding factor in the election. But there's really no way of telling. On election night, Stewart and his gang of correspondents will be on duty pinpointing the comedy that is the marriage between political discourse and the media. \"We'll be pinpointing the absurdities. We'll be doing the analysis of the analysis and then analysing that.\" </p> <p><strong> Presidential comedy: the contenders</strong></p> <p><strong>Jay Leno</strong> </p> <p>Lantern-jawed stand-up comic who inherited the Tonight show from Johnny Carson. Refuses to disclose political allegiance because it \"taints the issue. It's like you go to a party and girls say about you 'That guy's gay.' Well, you've lost half the crowd already\".

      "byline": "John Dugdale",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>TV fiction is governed by naturalism, we've been taught to believe. But is it? Except in drama made or influenced by Ken Loach and Tony Garnett - This Life, The Cops, The Royle Family - telly characters follow a set of rules as detached from normality as those obeyed by figures in fairy tales. </p> <p>1. Travelling: public transport is only used for life-changing cross-country journeys or (typically with the protagonist on the London Underground, surrounded by unspoken menace) to symbolise urban alienation. For everyday travel, middle-class characters use cars, playing opera or soul tracks from their teens; working class characters use taxis; eccentrics cycle. Ever seen a bus stop in Weatherfield, Emmerdale, Brookside, Walford, or hear anyone talk about catching a bus? Thought not. </p> <p>2. Shopping: big weekly shops in out-of-town supermarkets, long queues, curt exchanges with check- out staff, not recognising a soul there - these joys are unknown to TV characters (unless a psychopathic slayer pursues them to Tesco in a thriller). Instead, they pick up a handful of items - they're never seen lugging three or four plastic bags home, or unloading a bootful of food - at a corner shop or Coronation Street's Freshco, where they chat with the cashier and can rely on bumping into neighbours. As in Big Brother, the rest of their requirements must be delivered overnight by elves. </p> <p>.3 Shagging: normally preceded by a candlelit supper, even if a glance at the window suggests it's mid-afternoon. Beneath the bedclothes, a brand of hands-off condom only available to TV characters pops out of the wrapper magically and sheaths the penis without any need for fumbling. Coitus is followed by a curious coyness: women wrap sheets primly around their upper torso like starlets in a 50s movie, although the only person who might be looking is their lover. Anyone getting up grabs a blanket or duvet as covering, as if sex and central heating were incompatible. </p> <p>4. Eating and drinking: many characters, such as Inspector Morse, exist on a purely fluid diet. This may be wise, as no sit-down meal with three or more present ever takes place without someone storming out or sulking. As for drink, TV characters are rarely seen without a cup or mug - but it's at the wrong angle for drinking, their lips aren't wet and you don't see them swallow. When alcohol is supposedly being drunk, characters are either stone-cold sober or slurring, sentimental, confessional, amorous and about to vomit at any moment, with no transition via slowly growing exuberance and gradual loss of inhibitions. </p> <p>5. Peeing: although soap characters spend every evening necking diuretic fluids in the pub, they never, ever need to spend a penny. In other drama, peeing is allowed - and in Ally McBeal, with its unisex toilet, seems to be necessary roughly every 10 minutes (is providing a water-cooler necessarily a good idea?) - but going to the loo without encountering anyone else is not: women go to Ladies where they mutter about their menfolk as they add more lippy, men to Gents where they exchange manly ban ter, growl at rivals and not infrequently get beaten up. </p> <p>6. Washing: middle-class characters use power-showers, with semi-translucent glass or plastic walls (never fully transparent, or just a tacky curtain); unless they're depressed, in which case they opt for a bath, invariably submerging their head as well as the rest of their body. Working-class characters don't appear to wash themselves at all, although they're occasionally seen bathing their kids or using mutual back-soaping as foreplay. </p> <p>7. Speaking: as the one part of their everyday persona actors are incapable of shedding is their vocal training, characters speak with crystal clarity and stagey projection, rendering much of TV fiction instantly implausible: so domestic comedies, from The Good Life via A Fine Romance to the current My Family, are really about the problems of eating breakfast or sharing a bed with an RSC star, not their nominal themes; cop shows are peopled by booming hams; sitcoms about young flat-sharers are unmistakably about recent Rada graduates. This at least explains why TV characters never mishear each other or need to have anything repeated. </p> <p>8. Watching and listening: except in The Royle Family, television exists for TV people only as a fire-like glow rather than as specific programmes; and soap characters - presumably to avert the dreadful risk of their seeing themselves and so Destroying the Viewer's Illusions - never watch it, preferring to devote all their leisure time to a fantasy version of the old-fashioned communal pub life the telly has largely destroyed. Radio serves only to broadcast pop songs that perfectly sum up characters' moods or dilemmas, or bulletins that contain disturbing news for them - just at the very moment they switch on, by an extraordinary coincidence. </p> <p>9. Phoning: except where the plot requires it, people phoned are instantly available - those called at home are always in, and getting through to those at work never entails voicemail hell or 10 minutes on hold listening to Vivaldi.

      "bodyText": "TV fiction is governed by naturalism, we've been taught to believe. But is it? Except in drama made or influenced by Ken Loach and Tony Garnett - This Life, The Cops, The Royle Family - telly characters follow a set of rules as detached from normality as those obeyed by figures in fairy tales. 1. Travelling: public transport is only used for life-changing cross-country journeys or (typically with the protagonist on the London Underground, surrounded by unspoken menace) to symbolise urban alienation. For everyday travel, middle-class characters use cars, playing opera or soul tracks from their teens; working class characters use taxis; eccentrics cycle. Ever seen a bus stop in Weatherfield, Emmerdale, Brookside, Walford, or hear anyone talk about catching a bus? Thought not. 2. Shopping: big weekly shops in out-of-town supermarkets, long queues, curt exchanges with check- out staff, not recognising a soul there - these joys are unknown to TV characters (unless a psychopathic slayer pursues them to Tesco in a thriller). Instead, they pick up a handful of items - they're never seen lugging three or four plastic bags home, or unloading a bootful of food - at a corner shop or Coronation Street's Freshco, where they chat with the cashier and can rely on bumping into neighbours. As in Big Brother, the rest of their requirements must be delivered overnight by elves. .3 Shagging: normally preceded by a candlelit supper, even if a glance at the window suggests it's mid-afternoon. Beneath the bedclothes, a brand of hands-off condom only available to TV characters pops out of the wrapper magically and sheaths the penis without any need for fumbling. Coitus is followed by a curious coyness: women wrap sheets primly around their upper torso like starlets in a 50s movie, although the only person who might be looking is their lover. Anyone getting up grabs a blanket or duvet as covering, as if sex and central heating were incompatible. 4. Eating and drinking: many characters, such as Inspector Morse, exist on a purely fluid diet. This may be wise, as no sit-down meal with three or more present ever takes place without someone storming out or sulking. As for drink, TV characters are rarely seen without a cup or mug - but it's at the wrong angle for drinking, their lips aren't wet and you don't see them swallow. When alcohol is supposedly being drunk, characters are either stone-cold sober or slurring, sentimental, confessional, amorous and about to vomit at any moment, with no transition via slowly growing exuberance and gradual loss of inhibitions. 5. Peeing: although soap characters spend every evening necking diuretic fluids in the pub, they never, ever need to spend a penny. In other drama, peeing is allowed - and in Ally McBeal, with its unisex toilet, seems to be necessary roughly every 10 minutes (is providing a water-cooler necessarily a good idea?) - but going to the loo without encountering anyone else is not: women go to Ladies where they mutter about their menfolk as they add more lippy, men to Gents where they exchange manly ban ter, growl at rivals and not infrequently get beaten up. 6. Washing: middle-class characters use power-showers, with semi-translucent glass or plastic walls (never fully transparent, or just a tacky curtain); unless they're depressed, in which case they opt for a bath, invariably submerging their head as well as the rest of their body. Working-class characters don't appear to wash themselves at all, although they're occasionally seen bathing their kids or using mutual back-soaping as foreplay. 7. Speaking: as the one part of their everyday persona actors are incapable of shedding is their vocal training, characters speak with crystal clarity and stagey projection, rendering much of TV fiction instantly implausible: so domestic comedies, from The Good Life via A Fine Romance to the current My Family, are really about the problems of eating breakfast or sharing a bed with an RSC star, not their nominal themes; cop shows are peopled by booming hams; sitcoms about young flat-sharers are unmistakably about recent Rada graduates. This at least explains why TV characters never mishear each other or need to have anything repeated. 8. Watching and listening: except in The Royle Family, television exists for TV people only as a fire-like glow rather than as specific programmes; and soap characters - presumably to avert the dreadful risk of their seeing themselves and so Destroying the Viewer's Illusions - never watch it, preferring to devote all their leisure time to a fantasy version of the old-fashioned communal pub life the telly has largely destroyed. Radio serves only to broadcast pop songs that perfectly sum up characters' moods or dilemmas, or bulletins that contain disturbing news for them - just at the very moment they switch on, by an extraordinary coincidence. 9. Phoning: except where the plot requires it, people phoned are instantly available - those called at home are always in, and getting through to those at work never entails voicemail hell or 10 minutes on hold listening to Vivaldi. Calls are made with gesticulations and exaggerated facial reactions a Neapolitan market trader would envy, as if performing to an invisible audience; a trait perhaps more credible since mass use of mobile phones, but also standard in period drama. 10. Computing: laptops are always wire-free (but never seem to run out of battery power) and with them the \"shut down\" command must not be used - simply snapping them shut is de rigueur. Like phoning, computing on TV is a surprisingly glitch-free activity, in which users never make errors, computers never crash (unless the plot demands it, as in Attachments), search engines produce perfect results on first go and download time averages two seconds.",

Take last week for instance. Allen had to battle his way through London traffic out to Northolt, west of London, where a private jet, once owned by Forte, awaited to take him all the way to . . . Southampton. </p> <p>*If Channel 4's marketers thought that placing one of their London billboards outside the offices of the Guardian would yield endless column inches for their programmes, they were seriously deluded. Until now. For on his way home from a hard day's media networking, Monkey was stopped in his tracks by the striking image staring down from the other side of Farringdon Road. There, promoting Film Four's hor ror weekend, was a rather familiar face, albeit contorted in mock fear. We didn't think Matt Baker, Channel 4's head of press and part-time model, was so easily scared. </p> <p>*Recent news from Television Centre suggests Greg Dyke is going to new lengths in his drive to eliminate the last vestiges of croissant culture from White City.

Rose, who has been with the Mail for 14 years, this week handed in his notice after being wooed by the News of the World, where he will be crime editor.

      "body": "<p>Big Brother was not only compulsive television viewing - it also stimulated unprecedented interest in webcasting, showing the public demand for watching uncut live events and making people realise that internet broadcasting, even on narrowband connections, was feasible. </p> <p>The figures speak for themselves: bigbrother.terra.com had 1m unique visitors the day Nasty Nick was ousted, even if not everyone could see the action. Throughout the 10-week series, the site served more than 26m live video streams, with users spending an average of 14.5 minutes on the site. </p> <p>More recently, news has filtered through that the new Blair Witch film, Blair Witch 2, received record viewing requests in the first few hours of its availablity. The 64-hour event, blairwitchwebfest.com, that began last Wednesday morning, managed to pull in an impressive 100,000 users in the first six hours. </p> <p>Paul Zwillenberg, managing director of KPE Europe, which works with TV production companies on interactive programming, agrees that Big Brother opened people's eyes. \"The effects are just beginning to be felt. Next year, broadband will revolutionise media and entertainment. At the moment, the TV business has only had about 1% of what it's going to see over the next five to 10 years.\" </p> <p>Since the summer, the more traditional broadcasters have been falling over themselves to get in on the act. Channel 4 is looking to build on its successful summer foray into webcasting when it launches e4.com, the website supporting the new entertainment channel, at the start of next year. </p> <p>\"With e4.com we are creating an interactive version of that unique feeling you get when you watch entertainment on Channel 4,\" says Stevan Keane, head of interactive commissioning at the channel. \"This doesn't mean banging out telly for the web. What it means is making new platforms to tell the Channel 4 story on their own terms. At the end of a year of fantasies about internet billions, the TV production sector understands this, and more forward-thinking producers are ready, with us, to use e4 TV to introduce new ideas across all media.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere, the BBC is bound by the restrictions of the licence fee, which means that it's been unable to allocate enough funding to support interactive and webcasting initiatives. However, it has started looking at ways in which it can painlessly resell TV programming to new overseas viewers, perhaps on a pay-per-view basis via the internet, and has hired a number of commissioners to develop more interactive initiatives. </p> <p>Over at ITV, Granada appears to be the only shareholder putting a lot of energy behind broadband initiatives, having pulled in experienced TV producers Simon Shaps and Justin Judd to run the new Granada Broadband division. Industry sources suggest that Granada is also planning a number of initiatives similar to those at Channel 4. </p> <p>BSkyB has not yet clarified its position, although its moves towards partnership with Kingston and potentially BT to develop broadband programming, in addition to its controlling stake in Open, indicate that it is about to do something significant in this area. </p> <p>Traditional broadcasters are joining a fledging industry that has not had much success. The illustrious Pop.com - which should have been the harbinger of Hollywood online - never made it off the ground. And not long after it shut up shop, pioneer American internet broadcaster Pseudo.com followed suit. These failures show that both sites suffered from over-ambition at a time when there was no demand for webcasting. </p> <p> While things have not changed much since September, the UK is a little further along the broadband route than the US (even if BT is dragging its heels) and, fingers crossed, we should be revelling in broadband heaven in six months' time. At least, that's what all the people currently working on web broadcasting strategies are hoping for. </p> <p>Other moves are afoot, spearheaded mainly by former TV producers and interactive TV developers. Prominent in this area are the likes of IchooseTV.com, hahabonk, MadcowTV.com, thejunkies.com. Narrowband limitations aside, the services that have got off the ground - thejunkies.com, itsyourmovie.com - have been instant successes with web audiences merely by word of mouth. Even though it's still very early days, the signs so far have been very encouraging. </p> <p>Last week, fan-based movie website MyMovies.net set out its stall when it signed a far-reaching deal with NTL to distribute its content across NTL's various platforms. At the same time, it tied up with the Short Film Bureau to develop a new short films channel, which adds impetus to its plans to launch a broadband video-on-demand service for feature films at the start of next year.

      "bodyText": "Big Brother was not only compulsive television viewing - it also stimulated unprecedented interest in webcasting, showing the public demand for watching uncut live events and making people realise that internet broadcasting, even on narrowband connections, was feasible. The figures speak for themselves: bigbrother.terra.com had 1m unique visitors the day Nasty Nick was ousted, even if not everyone could see the action. Throughout the 10-week series, the site served more than 26m live video streams, with users spending an average of 14.5 minutes on the site. More recently, news has filtered through that the new Blair Witch film, Blair Witch 2, received record viewing requests in the first few hours of its availablity. The 64-hour event, blairwitchwebfest.com, that began last Wednesday morning, managed to pull in an impressive 100,000 users in the first six hours. Paul Zwillenberg, managing director of KPE Europe, which works with TV production companies on interactive programming, agrees that Big Brother opened people's eyes. \"The effects are just beginning to be felt. Next year, broadband will revolutionise media and entertainment. At the moment, the TV business has only had about 1% of what it's going to see over the next five to 10 years.\" Since the summer, the more traditional broadcasters have been falling over themselves to get in on the act. Channel 4 is looking to build on its successful summer foray into webcasting when it launches e4.com, the website supporting the new entertainment channel, at the start of next year. \"With e4.com we are creating an interactive version of that unique feeling you get when you watch entertainment on Channel 4,\" says Stevan Keane, head of interactive commissioning at the channel. \"This doesn't mean banging out telly for the web. What it means is making new platforms to tell the Channel 4 story on their own terms. At the end of a year of fantasies about internet billions, the TV production sector understands this, and more forward-thinking producers are ready, with us, to use e4 TV to introduce new ideas across all media.\" Elsewhere, the BBC is bound by the restrictions of the licence fee, which means that it's been unable to allocate enough funding to support interactive and webcasting initiatives. However, it has started looking at ways in which it can painlessly resell TV programming to new overseas viewers, perhaps on a pay-per-view basis via the internet, and has hired a number of commissioners to develop more interactive initiatives. Over at ITV, Granada appears to be the only shareholder putting a lot of energy behind broadband initiatives, having pulled in experienced TV producers Simon Shaps and Justin Judd to run the new Granada Broadband division. Industry sources suggest that Granada is also planning a number of initiatives similar to those at Channel 4. BSkyB has not yet clarified its position, although its moves towards partnership with Kingston and potentially BT to develop broadband programming, in addition to its controlling stake in Open, indicate that it is about to do something significant in this area. Traditional broadcasters are joining a fledging industry that has not had much success. The illustrious Pop.com - which should have been the harbinger of Hollywood online - never made it off the ground. And not long after it shut up shop, pioneer American internet broadcaster Pseudo.com followed suit. These failures show that both sites suffered from over-ambition at a time when there was no demand for webcasting. While things have not changed much since September, the UK is a little further along the broadband route than the US (even if BT is dragging its heels) and, fingers crossed, we should be revelling in broadband heaven in six months' time. At least, that's what all the people currently working on web broadcasting strategies are hoping for. Other moves are afoot, spearheaded mainly by former TV producers and interactive TV developers. Prominent in this area are the likes of IchooseTV.com, hahabonk, MadcowTV.com, thejunkies.com. Narrowband limitations aside, the services that have got off the ground - thejunkies.com, itsyourmovie.com - have been instant successes with web audiences merely by word of mouth. Even though it's still very early days, the signs so far have been very encouraging. Last week, fan-based movie website MyMovies.net set out its stall when it signed a far-reaching deal with NTL to distribute its content across NTL's various platforms. At the same time, it tied up with the Short Film Bureau to develop a new short films channel, which adds impetus to its plans to launch a broadband video-on-demand service for feature films at the start of next year. Film festival site FilmFestivals.com is also adding momentum to the short film industry and, after opening a London office last week and plans to stream movies via the internet, is evolving towards providing internet video-on-demand. At the launch last week of the MyMovies.net/SFB alliance, film actress Joely Richardson and short film director Gaby Dellal were paraded as supporters of the move to seek wider internet distribution for the growing short-film industry.

The internet's phenome nal reach will change everything and mean more people all over the world have access to these films whenever they want,\" she says, adding that the move will invariably encourage more actors to start doing short films. While Dellal agrees that it's an exciting development, she sees a much darker side based on the mass-market perception of the internet as a place where sex cases lurk and porn is rife. \"I worry about its anonymity, and the feeling that there is something secret and covert about watching films on the internet. I can't get away from this thought that it's dirty, maybe because I'm old-fashioned.\" While latent demand is clearly being stirred up, the UK is still a good few months away from streaming full-length motion pictures via the web.

Over the past four months, the Taliban have made considerable territorial gains at the expense of the opposition Northern Alliance, and now control 95 per cent of the country. Four weeks ago, Taliban forces dealt a major blow to the opposition, led by General Ahmad Shah Masood, when they captured his political capital, Taloqan. Masood has since counter-attacked and recaptured ground to the west of the town. But his empire - also that of Afghanistan's ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani - is shrinking fast. After 20 years of Soviet occupation and civil war, Afghanis may soon find themselves in the novel situation of being at peace. Since sweeping into Kabul in September 1996, the Taliban have almost completed their victory over numerous rival factions. Masood, a Mujaheddin leader who fought against the Russians from his impregnable base in the Panjshir valley, is the only remaining obstacle. Reports suggest he has recently received aid and military equipment from the Russians - his one-time enemies - and Iran. But the territory that he controls is now just one remote north-eastern province, Badakhshan. His problem now is not money but manpower. He has too few fighters left to defeat the Taliban. After a break for the winter, which is bitterly cold in Afghanistan, hostilities are expected to resume in the spring. The Taliban will hope to sever Masood's supply lines and ultimately drive him out of the country for good. Reports suggest that he has already moved much of his equipment to a base across the Afghan border into Tajikistan. But most observers have not written him off quite yet. Masood is a very brave man. He will continue fighting even if he has to seek exile in Tajikistan, Rahimullah Yusafzai, a Pakistani journalist based in Peshawar, said last night. But he conceded that the Taliban were now poised for complete victory. The Taliban have surprised everybody. Nobody thought they would achieve this much, he added. With the fighting now confined to the extreme north east, the Taliban are turning their attention to the outside world and, in particular, their more difficult struggle for international recognition. Faiz Ahmed Faiz, the Taliban's foreign affairs spokesman, yesterday told The Guardian it was an \"unacceptable injustice\" that his government should be denied a UN seat, still occupied by President Rabbini's ousted regime. Only three countries recognise the Taliban - Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. It is likely to be a long time before the Americans join them. They imposed sanctions last year, accusing the Taliban of promoting terrorism, harbouring Osama bin Laden, and being the world's biggest opium exporter. But the regime the west does recognise, as Mr Faiz pointed out, has \"no physical existence\". The problem is the Taliban's refusal to accommodate western sensibilities. Last month, a man accused of carrying out a bomb blast in Kabul, Meya Gul, was publicly hanged from a crane. Mullah Omah, the Taliban's reclusive leader, has recently decreed that women are not allowed to travel in taxis on their own. There have been no executions in Kabul's football stadium for four months, but thieves still routinely have their hands and legs amputated. And, of course, women are forced to wear burqhas, a practice that was prevalent in rural southern Afghanistan before the Taliban seized power but alien to Kabul and its educated elite, most of whom have now fled. Most aid workers in Afghanistan, together with some western diplomats, now accept that the Taliban are here to stay. Sooner or later the west will have to engage with them. The only victims of sanctions are not the Taliban, who are well off, but ordinary Afghans and, in particular, women, who, without work, sit in the streets and beg.

The outcry over the Bulger case is still in full voice - but in Trondheim there is a hush over the little girl who was left to die in the snow. Why is one country still bitter while another has forgiven and forgotten?",
      "byline": "Simon Hattenstone",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The two boys kicked the five-year-old girl repeatedly. They stripped her and stoned her and beat her till she was unconscious. Then they left Silje R\u00e6derg rd in the snow to freeze to death. The comparisons with the Bulger case were as eery as they were inevitable. It was only a year after Jon Venables and Robert Thompson had been found guilty of the murder of James Bulger. The British case had caused an outcry. The violent nature of the response was almost as shocking as the killing. Mobs descended on Preston crown court, threw stones at the two police vans containing the boys, and bayed for vengeance. In a way the killing in Norway was even more shocking. England had seen child murderers before. But in the quiet, frozen town of Trondheim they were unheard of. There was barely any crime. The police officers were gentle, educated folk - more like social workers - who spent their time strolling around in snow-capped boots, chatting to the locals.</p> <p>Seven years on from the Bulger killings, the outcry hasn't died down. When Lord Woolf announced last week that Thompson and Venables were likely to be released next year and given new names and identities, many British newspapers responded with belligerent disbelief. \"Sick!\" screamed The Sun, \"Has justice betrayed the little boy who was never allowed to grow up?\" asked the Daily Mail. Denise Fergus, James Bulger's mother, said the children had got away with murder in every sense. Six years on from the killing of Silje, by contrast, there is silence in Norway. The most infamous event in the history of Trondheim has been discussed, contexualised, resolved. Society has moved on.</p> <p>Harry Tiller, a journalist at the local paper in Trondheim, hasn't returned to the story in years; there's been no need to. Yes, he says, it was terrible, the most shocking thing he has had the misfortune to cover, but the culprits were just six years old; how did they know what they were doing? In Norway, where the age of criminality is 15 - as opposed to 10 in Britain - they were treated as victims not killers.</p> <p>Beate R\u00e6derg rd says she rarely goes out these days. She stays at home with her budgie and her partner and her two surviving children. She suffers from post-traumatic stress which makes it impossible to work. The family often talk about what happened to Silje and, however hard it is to explain, especially to eight-year-old Martin, she tells them how her sister died: \"Just the other day we were talking about it, and Martin asked what happened. I said Silje was killed by friends because they were playing too hard.\" It's true. The killers were Silje's friends, they'd spent many days in Beate's front room playing with the children. On October 15, 1994, Silje was playing with the friends on a local football field. The game turned violent. When Silje faded out of consciousness the boys ran away in fear.</p> <p>I ask Beate whether she hates the boys, and she seems astonished by the question. No, she says, of course not, although she still cannot comprehend what happened. \"They were Silje's friends ...\" she says, tailing off. Should they have been punished, locked up? \"No, they were punished enough by what they did. They have to live with that. I think everybody has got to be treated like a human being. The children had to be educated, had to learn how to treat other people so they could get back into society.\"</p> <p>Her quiet, humane response is shocking. I tell her I can't believe that she managed to forgive the boys. \"I have forgiven the boys for a long time. The hardest thing is to forgive myself.\" But you have nothing to blame yourself for?\" I know ... but I feel I haven't done everything in the right order after Silje's death. Small things. I think I should have included my family more in my grief.\" Beate talks about her 15-year-old daughter, Lyne, and the special bond she and Silje had. \"She feels a very important piece is missing in her life. She's coping with school but, you know, not getting the top marks.\"</p> <p>Trondheim, with its population of 135,000, was proud of its crime rate - there had been just two murders in six years at the time of Silje's death. The police not only knew legally that the boys were too young to be criminals; they felt morally they weren't criminals. They were victims of their own violence.</p> <p>Rolv Sverre Fostervold was the leader of the local child administration at the time: \"It was a Saturday and the winter was coming to Trondheim, the first snows. Then this awful thing happened.\" He and the police had to find a means of telling the community. \"Nothing like this had happened before, so on the Sunday we decided to open the schools to give information to the public. We appealed to the people not to start any violence, and guaranteed that no one else was at risk, that children were safe. It was very important to tell the people before the media.\"</p> <p>The killing of Silje had a profound effect on the close community. Local people felt collective shame, grief, and responsibility. The grief was not just for Silje and her family but for the boys and their families. How could such a tragedy happen?</p> <p>The boys were never named, but most people knew who they were. Their names have never appeared in the media, which shared the feeling of shame and grief and responsibility. Astonishingly, when the community were told that the boys would return to school within a couple of weeks there was no dissent. The boys were accompanied by a psychologist at all times.</p> <p>Trond Andreassen was the head psychologist at the child protection agency in Trondheim, and worked with the boys for four years until 1998. One of the things he remembers most clearly is how shocked the boys were. \"They were very afraid and confused. What we wanted to do was give the boys the chance to talk about what had happened, help them make sense of it.\" Did they understand what they had done? \"Yes, in the interviews with police they described what they had done in detail. Soon after one of the boys started school he asked the psychologist if they could go for a walk and he took him to the place where Silje was killed. The boy showed him what had happened.\" He talks about the way his team took the boys to Silje's graveyard and made sure they knew that she was dead.\"</p> <p>But how could the children understand the enormity of the killing if they were not punished? Andreassen asks what good punishment would have done. Like Beate, he believes their conscience punished them sufficiently. \"I don't think making them suffer is the way to make them realise what had happened.

      "bodyText": "The two boys kicked the five-year-old girl repeatedly. They stripped her and stoned her and beat her till she was unconscious. Then they left Silje R\u00e6derg rd in the snow to freeze to death. The comparisons with the Bulger case were as eery as they were inevitable. It was only a year after Jon Venables and Robert Thompson had been found guilty of the murder of James Bulger. The British case had caused an outcry. The violent nature of the response was almost as shocking as the killing. Mobs descended on Preston crown court, threw stones at the two police vans containing the boys, and bayed for vengeance. In a way the killing in Norway was even more shocking. England had seen child murderers before. But in the quiet, frozen town of Trondheim they were unheard of. There was barely any crime. The police officers were gentle, educated folk - more like social workers - who spent their time strolling around in snow-capped boots, chatting to the locals. Seven years on from the Bulger killings, the outcry hasn't died down. When Lord Woolf announced last week that Thompson and Venables were likely to be released next year and given new names and identities, many British newspapers responded with belligerent disbelief. \"Sick!\" screamed The Sun, \"Has justice betrayed the little boy who was never allowed to grow up?\" asked the Daily Mail. Denise Fergus, James Bulger's mother, said the children had got away with murder in every sense. Six years on from the killing of Silje, by contrast, there is silence in Norway. The most infamous event in the history of Trondheim has been discussed, contexualised, resolved. Society has moved on. Harry Tiller, a journalist at the local paper in Trondheim, hasn't returned to the story in years; there's been no need to. Yes, he says, it was terrible, the most shocking thing he has had the misfortune to cover, but the culprits were just six years old; how did they know what they were doing? In Norway, where the age of criminality is 15 - as opposed to 10 in Britain - they were treated as victims not killers. Beate R\u00e6derg rd says she rarely goes out these days. She stays at home with her budgie and her partner and her two surviving children. She suffers from post-traumatic stress which makes it impossible to work. The family often talk about what happened to Silje and, however hard it is to explain, especially to eight-year-old Martin, she tells them how her sister died: \"Just the other day we were talking about it, and Martin asked what happened. I said Silje was killed by friends because they were playing too hard.\" It's true. The killers were Silje's friends, they'd spent many days in Beate's front room playing with the children. On October 15, 1994, Silje was playing with the friends on a local football field. The game turned violent. When Silje faded out of consciousness the boys ran away in fear. I ask Beate whether she hates the boys, and she seems astonished by the question. No, she says, of course not, although she still cannot comprehend what happened. \"They were Silje's friends ...\" she says, tailing off. Should they have been punished, locked up? \"No, they were punished enough by what they did. They have to live with that. I think everybody has got to be treated like a human being. The children had to be educated, had to learn how to treat other people so they could get back into society.\" Her quiet, humane response is shocking. I tell her I can't believe that she managed to forgive the boys. \"I have forgiven the boys for a long time. The hardest thing is to forgive myself.\" But you have nothing to blame yourself for?\" I know ... but I feel I haven't done everything in the right order after Silje's death. Small things. I think I should have included my family more in my grief.\" Beate talks about her 15-year-old daughter, Lyne, and the special bond she and Silje had. \"She feels a very important piece is missing in her life. She's coping with school but, you know, not getting the top marks.\" Trondheim, with its population of 135,000, was proud of its crime rate - there had been just two murders in six years at the time of Silje's death. The police not only knew legally that the boys were too young to be criminals; they felt morally they weren't criminals. They were victims of their own violence. Rolv Sverre Fostervold was the leader of the local child administration at the time: \"It was a Saturday and the winter was coming to Trondheim, the first snows. Then this awful thing happened.\" He and the police had to find a means of telling the community. \"Nothing like this had happened before, so on the Sunday we decided to open the schools to give information to the public. We appealed to the people not to start any violence, and guaranteed that no one else was at risk, that children were safe. It was very important to tell the people before the media.\" The killing of Silje had a profound effect on the close community. Local people felt collective shame, grief, and responsibility. The grief was not just for Silje and her family but for the boys and their families. How could such a tragedy happen? The boys were never named, but most people knew who they were. Their names have never appeared in the media, which shared the feeling of shame and grief and responsibility. Astonishingly, when the community were told that the boys would return to school within a couple of weeks there was no dissent. The boys were accompanied by a psychologist at all times. Trond Andreassen was the head psychologist at the child protection agency in Trondheim, and worked with the boys for four years until 1998. One of the things he remembers most clearly is how shocked the boys were. \"They were very afraid and confused. What we wanted to do was give the boys the chance to talk about what had happened, help them make sense of it.\" Did they understand what they had done? \"Yes, in the interviews with police they described what they had done in detail. Soon after one of the boys started school he asked the psychologist if they could go for a walk and he took him to the place where Silje was killed. The boy showed him what had happened.\" He talks about the way his team took the boys to Silje's graveyard and made sure they knew that she was dead.\" But how could the children understand the enormity of the killing if they were not punished? Andreassen asks what good punishment would have done. Like Beate, he believes their conscience punished them sufficiently. \"I don't think making them suffer is the way to make them realise what had happened. When you are continually punished for something you can't undo you have to do something to protect yourself so you begin to imagine it's not really you who did it. You develop a split personality.\" In Britain, Lord Woolf has talked about the rehabilitation of Thompson and Venables. Andreassen believes it's too late. \"What happened to them was to make sure the trauma was as great as possible. They've been exorcised from the normal environment. In Norway we were concerned to put the boys into as normal a situation as possible.\" Rather than coming to terms with themselves, when Thompson and Venables are released they will adopt new names, move to alien environments, be forced to literally re-invent themselves.

Meanwhile Roberto Carlos revealed that he had been scared of \"not getting home alive,\" - words which were to prove horribly prophetic. </p> <p>On Tuesday an already emotional night in Leeds led to tragedy when a Barcelona supporter was shot dead in the small town of Chinchilla by 57-year-old Real Madrid fan Manuel Gabald\u00f3n. The madridista took to the streets with a box of fireworks to celebrate his rivals' defeat at Elland Road. Or so he thought. When Bar\u00e7a fan and local baker Francisco Javier Jim\u00e9nez kindly revealed that Rivaldo had saved the day a huge argument blew up. Gabald\u00f3n returned home, collected his hunting rifle and returned to settle the dispute. The Madrid fan has been described by locals as a \"conflictive personality\" (i.e. a nutter) and the town's mayor confirmed that the two had been \"involved in fights before\". Even so, no one foresaw such a terrible end. </p> <p>Emotions have also been running high in Valencia. Gaizka Mendieta has been far from happy, as he showed with his tetchy response to scoring the winner against Zaragoza last week. Abused by a section of his own fans, Valencia's captain barely celebrated the strike. Instead an indignant \"hijos de puta\" (sons of bitches) was clearly visible to anyone with the most elementary of lip-reading skills. </p> <p>Then on Wednesday the club acted to avoid similar scenes to those witnessed at the Camp Nou by leaving ex-Olympiakos midfielder Zlatko Zahovic out of their squad for the trip to Athens. It was probably a wise move - messages left on Zahovic's website declaring that \"the Slovenians will have to come to Athens to collect the bones of their idol\" hardly boded well. </p> <p>Perhaps temperatures within the Valencia squad had cooled down too much by Sunday, as over in Pamplona, H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper's side were unable to muster up any passion against newly promoted Osasuna. The league leaders fell behind to a Mateo strike inside six minutes, but got out of jail when Cruchaga scored an own goal twelve minutes later. Valencia only managed one shot on target in the whole of the second half and victory hardly looked on the cards, until John Carew scored with just five minutes remaining, to keep them top of the Primera Liga. </p> <p>Emotions were also running high in San Sebasti\u00e1n, where Javier Clemente was sacked as manager of Real Sociedad on Monday. Never one to smile when a frown will do, the ex-national coach was adamant that the blame lay with press, players and fans. Oh, and there was a sinister plot against him, too: \"I'm not the problem\", Clemente claimed \"someone [at the club] was interested in creating a bad atmosphere\". Like Spanish supporters after the 98 World Cup, Real fans won't exactly be sorry to see him go. </p> <p>But Clemente's departure didn't help the struggling Sociedad side. This weekend it was Real Madrid's turn to fill their boots in San Sebasti\u00e1n - just what caretaker boss Salva Iriarte needed. Madrid - whose fans gave rapturous receptions to 'Octava' heroes Morientes and McManaman (long time, no see) at the Bernab\u00e9u in midweek - ran out comfortable winners. Guti and Savio were the key men, grabbing one each in a 4-1 victory. Figo and Hierro completed the scoring in a game all too easy for Madrid. So easy, in fact, that the Spanish league's worst player, Geremi, even managed to hit the post from Figo's corner. Nice to see uncle Vicente is letting him take them again. </p> <p>Rivaldo, another player not entirely happy with life, was even more downcast on Saturday night. Barcelona were totally outclassed during their visit to Mallorca, where their defence was torn apart by Samuel Eto'o and Alberto Luque. That said, even the Neville brothers would have fancied their chances against goalkeeper Dutruel and defender Sergi, who combined hilariously to gift the islanders both goals in a 2-0 win. Twice Dutruel failed to hold pretty tame efforts from Luque. Twice Sergi stood and watched. And twice Mallorca punished them, Eto'o finishing off the first and Ibagaza the second. Dutruel, the latest in a long line of dreadful Camp Nou keepers, scandalously claimed afterwards that he \"didn't feel guilty.\"</p> <p>That classic symbol of Spanish discontent - the hanky wave ('pa\u00f1olada') - was the order of the day in Soria, where Numancia hosted Deportivo La Coruna. Referee Daud\u00e9n Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez was the object of the Numancia fans' wrath, failing to award a penalty in the 93rd minute after a clear foul by Deportivo defender Helder. That would have levelled the score at 2-2 after a spirited Numancia comeback. As it is Depor stay in touch at the top, two points behind Valencia. </p> <p>Elsewhere this weekend Villarreal and Athletic (0-0) and M\u00e1laga and Zaragoza (1-1) drew, while there were 2-1 home wins for Las Palmas against Racing and Celta against Valladolid. Rayo missed the chance to stay ahead of city rivals Real Madrid, losing at home to last year's surprise package Alav\u00e9s. The Vitoria side look set to defy the odds once again - they currently lie third.</p> <p>Finally, a little quiz for the medical staff at Rangers. Who was this weekend's goal-scoring man of the match when Espanyol pulled themselves out of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win over Oviedo? Here's a little clue, boys - \"if he plays again he could wreck his whole career\".</p>",

Then on Wednesday the club acted to avoid similar scenes to those witnessed at the Camp Nou by leaving ex-Olympiakos midfielder Zlatko Zahovic out of their squad for the trip to Athens. It was probably a wise move - messages left on Zahovic's website declaring that \"the Slovenians will have to come to Athens to collect the bones of their idol\" hardly boded well. Perhaps temperatures within the Valencia squad had cooled down too much by Sunday, as over in Pamplona, H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper's side were unable to muster up any passion against newly promoted Osasuna. The league leaders fell behind to a Mateo strike inside six minutes, but got out of jail when Cruchaga scored an own goal twelve minutes later. Valencia only managed one shot on target in the whole of the second half and victory hardly looked on the cards, until John Carew scored with just five minutes remaining, to keep them top of the Primera Liga. Emotions were also running high in San Sebasti\u00e1n, where Javier Clemente was sacked as manager of Real Sociedad on Monday. Never one to smile when a frown will do, the ex-national coach was adamant that the blame lay with press, players and fans. Oh, and there was a sinister plot against him, too: \"I'm not the problem\", Clemente claimed \"someone [at the club] was interested in creating a bad atmosphere\". Like Spanish supporters after the 98 World Cup, Real fans won't exactly be sorry to see him go. But Clemente's departure didn't help the struggling Sociedad side. This weekend it was Real Madrid's turn to fill their boots in San Sebasti\u00e1n - just what caretaker boss Salva Iriarte needed. Madrid - whose fans gave rapturous receptions to 'Octava' heroes Morientes and McManaman (long time, no see) at the Bernab\u00e9u in midweek - ran out comfortable winners. Guti and Savio were the key men, grabbing one each in a 4-1 victory. Figo and Hierro completed the scoring in a game all too easy for Madrid. So easy, in fact, that the Spanish league's worst player, Geremi, even managed to hit the post from Figo's corner. Nice to see uncle Vicente is letting him take them again. Rivaldo, another player not entirely happy with life, was even more downcast on Saturday night. Barcelona were totally outclassed during their visit to Mallorca, where their defence was torn apart by Samuel Eto'o and Alberto Luque. That said, even the Neville brothers would have fancied their chances against goalkeeper Dutruel and defender Sergi, who combined hilariously to gift the islanders both goals in a 2-0 win. Twice Dutruel failed to hold pretty tame efforts from Luque. Twice Sergi stood and watched. And twice Mallorca punished them, Eto'o finishing off the first and Ibagaza the second. Dutruel, the latest in a long line of dreadful Camp Nou keepers, scandalously claimed afterwards that he \"didn't feel guilty.\" That classic symbol of Spanish discontent - the hanky wave ('pa\u00f1olada') - was the order of the day in Soria, where Numancia hosted Deportivo La Coruna. Referee Daud\u00e9n Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez was the object of the Numancia fans' wrath, failing to award a penalty in the 93rd minute after a clear foul by Deportivo defender Helder. That would have levelled the score at 2-2 after a spirited Numancia comeback. As it is Depor stay in touch at the top, two points behind Valencia. Elsewhere this weekend Villarreal and Athletic (0-0) and M\u00e1laga and Zaragoza (1-1) drew, while there were 2-1 home wins for Las Palmas against Racing and Celta against Valladolid. Rayo missed the chance to stay ahead of city rivals Real Madrid, losing at home to last year's surprise package Alav\u00e9s. The Vitoria side look set to defy the odds once again - they currently lie third. Finally, a little quiz for the medical staff at Rangers. Who was this weekend's goal-scoring man of the match when Espanyol pulled themselves out of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win over Oviedo? Here's a little clue, boys - \"if he plays again he could wreck his whole career\".",

      "bodyText": "The US is ready to break rank with its Nato partners by conceding for the first time that Kosovo can become independent from Serbia. The shift in policy, discussed in secret talks this month between the US special envoy, Richard Holbrooke, and US diplomats in the Balkans, will anger Britain and other Nato members and risks creating a rift with Russia, which retains close ties with Serbia. The change of direction emerged in the Kosovan capital, Pristina, as votes were being counted yesterday in the province's first democratic elections. The three big Kosovan Albanian parties all stood on an independence platform. The Kosovan Serbs almost unanimously boycotted the elections, for local authorities. The Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), led by the moderate nationalist Ibrahim Rugova, was sweeping to power throughout the province, according to independent observers. The official results are expected today. Nato and the UN security council have maintained that, in spite of the Nato-led war last year which forced Serbian troops out of the province, Kosovo should remain a sovereign part of Yugoslavia. British officials recently ruled out independence as an option, saying that further fragmentation in the Balkans would increase instability and that a state as small as Kosovo would be unsustainable. Security council resolution 1244, passed in June last year at the end of the war, reaffirmed \"the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\". But a senior US official in Pristina, who spent last week with Mr Holbrooke, has for the first time disputed the widely-held interpretation of the resolution. He said that 1244 \"explicitly recognises the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia but it does not mean Kosovo cannot be independent\". US government lawyers spent the past few weeks looking at the resolution in detail and they concluded that it did not rule out independence. The US source agreed that independence was fast becoming a reality on the ground because almost half the Kosovan Serbs had left the province and the Kosovo Albanians were setting up their own judicial and political system. Acknowledging that few Kosovo Albanians were prepared to consider even a loose federation with Belgrade, he said: \"Kosovo will not be pushed back into Serbia.\" The US is unlikely to go public on its policy switch in the near future in case it undermines Yugoslavia's new democratically elected president, Vojislav Kostunica. The loss of Kosovo, which is an important historical symbol for Serbia, would inflame Serbian nationalist hardliners. The US source ruled out partitioning the province between the northern part, predominantly populated by Serbs, which would join Serbia while the rest of the country, mainly Kosovo Albanians, would enter into a Greater Albania. He hoped the Kosovo Serbs and Albanians could reach an accommodation. \"They will never be friends sitting around the campfire singing Kumbaya... but they will learn to live with one another.\" The elections held in Kosovo on Saturday were for control of the province's 30 municipalities, but the Kosovo Albanians treated them as a referendum on independence. The main contenders were Mr Rugova's LDK and the Democratic Party of Kosovo, led by Hashim Thaci, a nationalist hardliner and former commander of the Kosovan Liberation Army, which fought a guerrilla campaign against the Yugoslav army. Mr Thaci wants Kosovo to become independent from Serbia as soon as possible and join Albania. Mr Rugova also wants independence but at a more cautious pace and for Kosovo to be a state in its own right, free of both Serbia and Albania.",

But the decision - following a visit to Freetown last week by General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defence staff - comes amid growing concern about the ability of president Ahmed Kabbah's government to face up to the RUF rebels. There are also doubts about the UN's commitment to maintaining a peacekeeping force in the country. India, Jordan and Egypt, which have provided the bulk of the current UN force in Sierra Leone, all say they will withdraw thousands of their troops. A document leaked from UN headquarters in New York last week said the force was \"in serious danger of collapse\" unless Britain provided troops for \"operational and tactical-level work.\" Mr Hoon announced earlier this month that the number of British troops training Sierra Leone's army was being increased to about 400 from about 200. A senior British officer is also being sent to Freetown with his own brigade headquarters effectively setting up a parallel British command structure in the former colony. Ministry of defence sources insist British troops will not be involved in combat and will not join the UN peacekeeping force. Yet the imminent rundown of the 13,000-strong UN force will put new pressure on Britain to step up its open-ended commitment to Sierra Leone. The presence of the naval task force off the country's coast - presumably for a strictly limited period - may help to boost the morale of the Kabbah government, but it will not help the security situation on the ground. Iain Duncan-Smith, the Conservatives' shadow defence secretary, warned at the weekend that the government was risking \"dragging our military deeper and deeper into the mess and muddle of Sierra Leone\". He singled out the foreign secretary for blame: \"Again our servicemen and women are paying the price of Robin Cook's failed foreign policy in Sierra Leone. His policies in Sierra Leone change from day to day but our armed forces involvement increases week to week.\" Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said British troops should be assigned to the UN. Earlier this year, in May, Britain rushed marines and paratroopers to Sierra Leone after RUF rebels captured 500 UN peacekeepers and headed towards the capital Freetown. Many ordinary people were sad and upset when they left. In September, British troops, including SAS soldiers, rescued soldiers of the Royal Irish Regiment held by the West Side Boys, a disorganised militia that he been thought friendly to the government. One soldier was killed in the rescue mission.",

As the only South Korean community inside the demilitarised zone - the border between North and South, which Bill Clinton once called \"the scariest place on earth\" - the 132 villagers have been on the frontline of the cold war for more than 50 years. In the increasingly unlikely event of an invasion by the North, their homes and paddy fields will be the first to be pummelled by artillery and overrun by tanks. But rather than feeling relief at the greatest chance of a thaw in half a century, the villagers - like many South Koreans - are beginning to wonder whether better relations are really in their best interest.

Public prosecutors have opened an investigation into the claim by a former police officer that Austria's most controversial politician and 17 other high-ranking Freedom party (FPO) members waged a dirty-tricks campaign against their opponents using classified information. Thirteen police officers from Vienna are suspected of having violated data protection laws as part of a group of FPO sympathisers in the police force, allegedly including Mr Haider's personal bodyguard. The man who should be investigating the allegations, the far-right justice minister, Dieter B\u00f6hmdorfer, is also alleged to be involved. The weekly newspaper Falter has claimed that during his years as Mr Haider's personal lawyer, Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer, who was singled out in September by the EU's report on Austria as the one government figure who should resign, used classified police files in court cases against the party's critics. Mr B\u00f6hmdorfer has so far rejected calls from the opposition and the judges' union to resign. \"I've never obtained information illegally or got anyone else to do so on my behalf,\" he said through a spokesman. The spying allegations, first made in a book by a former police officer and Freedom party activist, Josef Kleindienst, have grown into what has been dubbed \"Austria's Watergate\". Mr Kleindienst says he was one of an elite group of hand-picked officers who, on behalf of leading FPO members, spied on anyone seen as a threat to the party's rise to power. \"We sifted through the archives and passed on the relevant information - anything from information about opponents' lifestyles to what cars they owned, where they lived, and any offences they or acquaintances had committed,\" he said.

Ministers are reluctant to sanction the final humiliation of demolition for a \u00a31bn project they once saw as the defining achievement of Tony Blair's first term.</p> <p>But first a consortium led by Japan's Nomura bank dropped out of bidding to acquire the dome, accusing the New Millennium Experience Company of bad faith and providing poor figures, and then its rival, Legacy, also dropped its \u00a3120m offer.</p> <p>So with ministers hanging back, Mr James went public yesterday admitting that the business park option now under discussion may not work.</p> <p>Asked on BBC TV's On the Record programme if he could sustain the dome, Mr James replied: \"There has to be a possibility that unless a buyer comes along and is prepared to see a constructive purpose to the future of the dome then the dome will have to be considered for alternative usage in some leisure, sports or maybe some business park context.\"</p> <p>The crucial remark came when he added: \"Alternatively, beyond that, then comes the value of the land and the development of the value of the land and the development of the peninsula, the whole Greenwich peninsula which is a vast area, I must say.

      "bodyText": "The City troubleshooter called in to rescue the Millennium Dome yesterday gave his first public hint that he would like ministers to maximise the development value of the site by agreeing to the early demolition of what Tony Blair once called \"an amazing structure\". David James had previously said in private - to the prime minister's ally, Lord Falconer, who is grappling with diminishing options for cutting the government's losses, and loss of face, over the dome project - that he could sell the land for \u00a3300m if developers were given a free hand. The site is just across the Thames from Canary Wharf at the tip of an industrial peninsula once heavily polluted at Greenwich. Ministers are reluctant to sanction the final humiliation of demolition for a \u00a31bn project they once saw as the defining achievement of Tony Blair's first term. But first a consortium led by Japan's Nomura bank dropped out of bidding to acquire the dome, accusing the New Millennium Experience Company of bad faith and providing poor figures, and then its rival, Legacy, also dropped its \u00a3120m offer. So with ministers hanging back, Mr James went public yesterday admitting that the business park option now under discussion may not work. Asked on BBC TV's On the Record programme if he could sustain the dome, Mr James replied: \"There has to be a possibility that unless a buyer comes along and is prepared to see a constructive purpose to the future of the dome then the dome will have to be considered for alternative usage in some leisure, sports or maybe some business park context.\" The crucial remark came when he added: \"Alternatively, beyond that, then comes the value of the land and the development of the value of the land and the development of the peninsula, the whole Greenwich peninsula which is a vast area, I must say. It's the biggest undeveloped area in the whole of London.\" Mr James was called in last month after the dome's losses from public funds, mainly the national lottery, passed the \u00a3630m mark and its total cost reached \u00a31bn. Conservative and Labour critics, who believe that Mr Blair and Peter Mandelson pushed the project ahead despite cabinet resistance, are determined to harry those responsible. The national audit office is compiling what is expected to be a damning report. In yesterday's BBC programme the Tory culture spokesman, Peter Ainsworth, warned: \"There's very serious trouble ahead on the dome as gradually, bit by bit, and inch by inch the truth comes out about this project. \"At the moment there's a great deal of ignorance about what actually really went wrong and who was responsible, and over the next few months we will be seeing how this huge national project came to be the national disgrace that it is today.\" Last week, half-term holidays for most schools, the dome enjoyed some of its best attendance figures so far.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's blood services rely on good citizenship and an altruistic desire to help others in need, coupled, of course, with the attraction to donors of free tea and biscuits. About 2m people a year donate blood, some more than once, but demand is inexorably rising as once impossible surgical procedures become practical and there is a drive to cut waiting lists for non-urgent surgery. Demography is also having its effect. There are fewer young people to donate blood and more older people needing it. In addition, there are periodic concerns about safety. In the 1980s haemophiliacs contracted HIV and other patients were infected with hepatitis C from donated blood. More recently there have been fears that the agent responsible for causing variant CJD, the human form of BSE, can theoretically be transmitted through blood donations. This has meant that all donated blood is now leucodepleted - the white cells thought most likely to carry the infection are filtered out - while plasma-derived products are imported from the US. These are mainly used as coagulation factors for haemophiliacs, albumin to maintain blood volume and immunoglobulins to treat immune deficiencies. But many thousands of people a year are still given fresh frozen plasma from British donors to clot the blood of victims of trauma or those involved in long, complicated operations needing large transfusions. In the past few months research has indicated that sheep can transfer a BSE-like disease to another sheep through blood transfusion, long before displaying outward signs of the disease. That has made everyone think again. Scientists on the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee have recommended tests, again using sheep, to check whether leucodepletion eliminates the risk of transmission of vCJD through transfusions or simply reduces it. There is also increasing scientific evidence that mice showing clinical signs of BSE carry low levels of infectivity in their blood plasma. It would have further damaging consequences for confidence in human blood safety if it was shown that the plasma was infective before those outward signs of the disease were displayed. This nervousness has prompted new debate within the medical profession and among government advisers as to whether the public should be made far more aware of opportunities either to store their own blood in the weeks leading up to operations or to have their blood effectively recycled during the operations. Encouraging more use of such techniques would ensure that donated blood could be saved for those patients who had no alternative. NHS trusts were told in a Department of Health circular two years ago to explore whether they could do more in this direction but the suspicion is that little has changed.

The youngest victim of vCJD, the human form of BSE, 14-year-old Zoe Jeffries, died on Saturday. The oldest, a 74-year-old unnamed man, was confirmed as a vCJD victim on Friday. Until now, the age span of victims has been between 15 and 54. As our health correspondent, James Meikle, noted on Saturday, the death of the old man would seem to support the conclusion of Lord Phillips, chairman of the inquiry, that the BSE infection of the national herd began in the 1970s, not the 1980s. If so, do scientists have to think again about the potential risk to human health? Just how exposed were people who ate infected meat in the 1970s, long before any control measures to combat BSE, were introduced? Does the death of Zoe Jeffries, who became a victim aged 12, mean contaminated meat was getting into the human food chain, despite the controls that were applied in 1989?</p> <p>Reassessment will follow both deaths but particularly the older victim's. Even before Zoe's death, there were worrying signs that BSE was entering the human food chain after the 1989 controls were put in place. The Phillips report pointed to three dangers: the delay in banning the mechanically recovered meat process until 1995; the failure to enforce new safety procedures in slaughterhouses until 1995; and cross contamination of feed, both at the factory where beef offal was allowed in pig and poultry feeds, and at the farm. Other reassessments are being made on the use of beef sources in the 1970s for some vaccines and cosmetics.</p> <p>What is Joe Public to make of all these reviews? Here is an opportunity for the health and agriculture secretaries, plus even more importantly their officials, to demonstrate that a new era has begun. Whatever happens to the freedom of information bill in parliament, let them signal that the secrecy and false messages with which Whitehall attempted to sedate the British public for most of this epidemic, are over. From now on, let the public be treated both openly and honestly. As Phillips noted, only in this way can public confidence begin to be restored in government warnings. If ministers, or chief medical officers, don't know, let them say so. Let paragraph 1301 be reproduced and placed above Whitehall desks: \"We believe that food scares and vaccine scares thrive on a belief that the government is withholding information. If doubts are openly expressed and publicly explored, the public are capable of responding rationally.\"</p> <p>There are three fronts on which ministers should move quickly. First on risk assessments. These range from a few hundred projected deaths from vCJD to 136,000. The specialists should not be blamed for such a wide variation, there are so many unknowns. Some earlier estimates, when links between BSE and vCJD were first established, talked of millions. What is needed is an update, in light of Phillips, of the latest estimate on risk. By all means put them in perspective, so the public are better able to gauge them. Second, contingency planning: Phillips found it was far from adequate. Some are now proceeding (see today's story on new blood procedures in surgery). But what plans have health and social services drawn up in case vCJD deaths reach the projected death a day? They have averaged 10 a year in the last five, but already reached 25 this year. Third, reassessments by scientists: precisely what is being reassessed, by whom and when will they be ready?

The aged are more easily \"dispensable\"; their illness vaguely labelled dementia. This was the case with my mother whose death was correctly diagnosed only because we sent her brain tissue to be analysed.</p> <p>At the Edinburgh CJD unit in 1993 I was told categorically that there was no link with beef and BSE. When I raised the question of the number of aged people with CJD, I was informed that \"a study in another European country in the 60s\" brought no higher percentage. When I reminded the researcher that this evidence was elsewhere, another time and before the BSE crisis, he fell silent. <br><b>Judith Okely </b><br> Professor of social anthropology, University of Hull <br><a href=\"mailto:J.M.Okely@cas.hull.ac.uk\">J.M.Okely@cas.hull.ac.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Lord Phillips' report says that it was not the Ministry of Agriculture's policy to \"lean in favour of agricultural producers to the detriment of the consumer\" and that \"BSE developed into an epidemic as a consequence of an intensive farming practice\" (Report, October 27). Phillips misses the point. The ministry had leaned over so far, and so long ago, that the acceptance of such major risks had become accepted.</p> <p>Food production requires a firm public health and environmental audit. I hope that the Department of Health and the Food Standards agency are up to the job.<br><b> Dr Geof Rayner </b><br> Chair, UK Public Health Association</p> <p>\u0095 You highlight the 80 lives lost to CJD. While tragic, the figures represent a relatively small average 17 deaths a year since the mid 1990s compared with other causes of death such as road accidents, cancer and accidents in the home. We must keep the risks in perspective. Seventy people die on our roads every week. Since 1995, there have been 20,000 road deaths. The BSE crisis cost billions of pounds. It would cost a fraction of this to save 100 lives on the roads. <br> <b> Peter Easton</b><br> Bristol<br><a href=\"mailto:peter@easton1000.freeserve.co.uk\">peter@easton1000.freeserve.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Finally the authorities have recognised that there may be a hidden number of elderly people dying of CJD, but concern and research has focused on the young (Civil servants, scientists and the road to the truth, October 28). The aged are more easily \"dispensable\"; their illness vaguely labelled dementia. This was the case with my mother whose death was correctly diagnosed only because we sent her brain tissue to be analysed. At the Edinburgh CJD unit in 1993 I was told categorically that there was no link with beef and BSE. When I raised the question of the number of aged people with CJD, I was informed that \"a study in another European country in the 60s\" brought no higher percentage. When I reminded the researcher that this evidence was elsewhere, another time and before the BSE crisis, he fell silent. Judith Okely Professor of social anthropology, University of Hull J.M.Okely@cas.hull.ac.uk \u0095 Lord Phillips' report says that it was not the Ministry of Agriculture's policy to \"lean in favour of agricultural producers to the detriment of the consumer\" and that \"BSE developed into an epidemic as a consequence of an intensive farming practice\" (Report, October 27). Phillips misses the point. The ministry had leaned over so far, and so long ago, that the acceptance of such major risks had become accepted. Food production requires a firm public health and environmental audit. I hope that the Department of Health and the Food Standards agency are up to the job. Dr Geof Rayner Chair, UK Public Health Association \u0095 You highlight the 80 lives lost to CJD. While tragic, the figures represent a relatively small average 17 deaths a year since the mid 1990s compared with other causes of death such as road accidents, cancer and accidents in the home. We must keep the risks in perspective. Seventy people die on our roads every week. Since 1995, there have been 20,000 road deaths. The BSE crisis cost billions of pounds. It would cost a fraction of this to save 100 lives on the roads. Peter Easton Bristol peter@easton1000.freeserve.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Terrific news from the Archbishop of Canterbury: we have become a society of atheists. In a startlingly pessimistic analysis of the role of the church in contemporary Britain, Dr George Carey admits that \"a tacit atheism prevails\" and that people have stopped believing in life after death. Not that he is throwing in the towel; Dr Carey has also appealed to Anglicans to redouble their efforts and reach out to unbelievers. But his sermon, delivered at St German's Cathedral on the Isle of Man at the end of last week, contained a dramatic acknowledgment that a majority of the population no longer accepts the central tenets of Christianity.</p> <p>This shift has, in terms of church attendance at least, been apparent for some time. In a population of 60m, the number of people who turn up at Anglican services on Sundays has dropped below one million.

      "bodyText": "Terrific news from the Archbishop of Canterbury: we have become a society of atheists. In a startlingly pessimistic analysis of the role of the church in contemporary Britain, Dr George Carey admits that \"a tacit atheism prevails\" and that people have stopped believing in life after death. Not that he is throwing in the towel; Dr Carey has also appealed to Anglicans to redouble their efforts and reach out to unbelievers. But his sermon, delivered at St German's Cathedral on the Isle of Man at the end of last week, contained a dramatic acknowledgment that a majority of the population no longer accepts the central tenets of Christianity. This shift has, in terms of church attendance at least, been apparent for some time. In a population of 60m, the number of people who turn up at Anglican services on Sundays has dropped below one million. Other religions are doing better, but we have certainly moved, in the course of a century, from being a Christian society to one that is much more diverse in its beliefs. This is in my view a very good thing, although I am not sure that Dr Carey is accurate in diagnosing a surge in atheism.

      "bodyText": "Jean Carnahan will announce today whether she is taking one of the more improbable, but potentially one of the most significant, decisions of this year's US election campaign. Two weeks ago her husband Mel, governor of Missouri and the Democratic party's candidate for the state's US Senate seat on November 7, was killed in a plane crash south of St Louis. The Carnahans' eldest son, Roger, and a political aide also died in the crash. In spite of his death, Mr Carnahan remains officially on the ballot against the incumbent Republican, John Ashcroft, who is a strong conservative. Until Mr Carnahan died Missouri was seen as one of the handful of key Senate contests this year, where victory was crucial to the Democrats' hope of overturning the Republicans' current 54-46 majority. If Mr Carnahan wins, in spite of his death, the new governor of Missouri, Roger Wilson, a Democrat, has the power to appoint the person who will serve in the Senate until another election can be held in 2002. Mr Wilson has already indicated that he would like to appoint Mrs Carnahan. So important is the Missouri contest in the national picture that local Democrats have already resumed campaigning for Mr Carnahan under the slogan \"Still for Me\". A poll in the Kansas City Star last week showed Mr Carnahan level with Mr Ashcroft on 46% each. But the vital decision remains the one that his widow has said she will announce today, just a fortnight after losing her husband. Hundreds of local Democrats have urged her to run. Mrs Carnahan has not appeared in public since last week's funeral, but she issued a statement on Friday from her home in Jefferson City saying she would be consulting relatives over the weekend. The statement appeared to suggest that she had not ruled out the possibility of accepting the nomination. \"As I seek God's will for my life,\" Mrs Carnahan said, \"I see each day more clearly. I still believe deeply in the cause for which my husband lived and died. These shared values are a permanent part of my being.\" If she says yes, it is not clear whether she will take part in any formal campaigning activities in the week that remains before election day. \"This comes under the category of 'We've never been here before',\" the pollster John Zogby said. While Mrs Carnahan obviously has a severely difficult choice to make, Mr Ashcroft faces delicate decisions too. Until Mr Carnahan died the Missouri race was a rough affair, a grudge match between the state's two most prominent personalities that was as much personal as political. Mr Ashcroft has to step much more carefully in the new circumstances. If Mrs Carnahan decides against accepting the appointment, some Democrats hope that her daughter, Robin, who delivered a moving tribute to her father at his funeral, may agree to take the job. On the eve of yesterday's announcement, the St Louis Post-Dispatch published a new poll showing that Mr Carnahan would narrowly win the Senate seat if his widow announced that she would serve in his place. Mr Carnahan led Mr Ashcroft 47% to 45% in the poll. Seven widows of US senators have been appointed to serve out their dead husbands' terms in the past - including the widow of Senator Hubert Humphrey, the 1968 Democratic presidential candidate, in 1978. None, however, has been appointed in circumstances such as these, in which her husband never took his seat.",

      "trailText": "<p>BBC 2's new six-part series Changing Stages, presented by Sir Richard Eyre, fuses two notoriously difficult subjects: documentary and theatre.</p>",
      "byline": "Mark Lawson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's a well-established principle of domestic life that if you complain too often that something hasn't been done, you'll be invited to do it yourself. </p> <p>In the TV, Sir Richard Eyre - who, as a BBC governor, has frequently called for an extension to arts programming - now finds himself fronting Changing Stages, a six-part series about 20th-century theatre. As a tactic for disarming critics, it's rather like inviting the culture secretary to present the new BBC News At Ten. </p> <p>Changing Stages is a courageous project because to many viewers it will look like a pair of dodos huddling together in the scheduling zoo. Theatre and the serious documentary have much in common. Both are cherished by a small, ageing audience but activate the impatience of young commissars who question their ability to survive into the third millennium. Like a barrister defending a terrorist who dabbled in serial killing at weekends, Eyre is making two difficult cases simultaneously. </p> <p>The point was recently made here that - because of the car accident suffered by Robert Hughes, and the age and arthritis of Norman Mailer - BBC2's cultural presenters have been sedentary. Eyre reverses the trend. His walking shots often quicken to a run, and he begins one programme galloping a horse along an Atlantic beach. The first arts presenter who might have need of a stunt double. </p> <p>And Changing Stages successfully overcomes two serious disadvantages. The first is theatre's unfashionability as a subject. In this respect, the series reveals first-night nerves. A theatre audience is captive - social politeness makes even the bored return after the interval. But TV watchers are free spirits. Lose a viewer in the first part of a documentary sextet and they'll be doing something else for the next five Sundays. Understanding this - and that the series is a co-production aimed at even twitchier-fingered Americans - Eyre and director Roger Parsons try, as Greek theatre did, to settle the audience down with a jaunt before the serious themes. </p> <p>Though Shakespeare is the subject of the first programme, the first speakers aren't academics or biographers, but Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, America-friendly actors. The first director to be heard is Baz Luhrmann, whose cinematic Romeo and Juliet solved the problem which torments this opening episode - how to make Shakespeare sexy for a modern audience. Apart from Luhrmann's bravura tangent, the other extract featured in the opening sequence is from Shakespeare in Love. </p> <p>There are fears at this point that that the dollar input has forced the series to present Shakespeare as a Hollywood screenwriter rather than a Stratford actor-manager. But Eyre's intelligence and insight as a director are gradually allowed centre screen. The programme becomes an exercise in genuine popular scholarship, explaining how production styles of Shakespeare in Britain during the last century were first influenced by, and then fought against, codes of social behaviour. Newsreel of Eden quoting Shakespeare during Suez and John Patten being applauded by a Tory conference for promising that every child will learn the Bard illustrates the fight over the national playwright's meaning. </p> <p>Changing Stages also faces the problem that, while painting and architecture perfectly suit the arts documentary - eye and camera see buildings and pictures in much the same way - the camera makes theatre look phoney. The size of voice and gesture required to catch the eyes and ears of an audience in tip-up seats is too big for people sitting on sofas looking at glass. </p> <p>The series begins by making this point about the perishability of theatrical images with a televisual image which will still look good in 20 years. Winter whiteness fills the screen as Eyre, Russian-hatted in a frozen field, tells the legend that Michaelangelo's greatest work was a snow sculpture for the Medicis. All theatre is a statue built from a blizzard, beauty of a few hours. The BBC's previous theatrical documentary epic - Ronald Harwood's All The World's A Stage - commissioned performances of key pieces, but Eyre's illustrations come from movie versions of Shakespeare, Miller and O'Neill. </p> <p>Relying on second-hand pictures of its subject, the series is sometimes over-strenuous in its original images. The fact that Laurence Olivier lived in Brighton prompts an elaborate comparison between his performance style and the resort. But the historical anecdotes are well-chosen - Lilian Baylis cooking bacon in her stage box during performances - and Eyre's directorial connections bring in almost every famous name ever seen on a theatre poster: Gielgud, Miller, Bennett, Hall, Brook, Nunn. </p> <p>Compressing a century's theatre into only slightly more time than a single performance of Hamlet takes to stage inevitably brings the curtain down in front of the enthusiasms of some viewers. Impressive as the third programme is on O'Neill, Miller, Williams and the mid-century Broadway musical, you feel the lack of Mamet and Sondheim. </p> <p>Whether or not all theatre is snow sculpture, a lot of discussion about it can be slush. Richard Eyre, though, is a man who loves theatre but is never a luvvie; in the camp without being camp. Making the case for theatre and the arts documentary series, he gets both his notorious clients off. </p> <p>\u0095 Changing Stages, Sunday, 7pm, BBC2.</p> <p><strong>Second sitting</strong></p> <p>Because of the newspaper convention that repeats are never reviewed, the dread of critics is writing about a piece you don't realise is on its second showing. But these days, I worry more about failing to review a new series because you mistakenly believe it's a repeat. This trap now lies in every Radio Times because of the tendency of successful formats to spawn minor variations. A brand new series is often something you've almost seen before. </p> <p>Flicking through this week's listings, I sagely noted the return of the cookery series Friends For Dinner (Wednesday, 8.30pm, BBC2), in which a top chef turns up to help a civilian cook dinner. Further research, however, reveals that this is apparently a fresh idea. The confusion occurs because it's been thrown together like a Boxing Day lunch from scraps of other cookery and gardening pro-am shows. </p> <p>In the first programme, Angela Wheeler hosts a Home Counties dinner party co-cooked with Jamie Oliver. In pro-am golf, partnerships are decided by handicap. In celebrity-normal cooking, pairings seem influenced by accent, the programme excited by the cheese-and-chocolate opposition of Angela's posh and Jamie's cockney.

      "bodyText": "It's a well-established principle of domestic life that if you complain too often that something hasn't been done, you'll be invited to do it yourself. In the TV, Sir Richard Eyre - who, as a BBC governor, has frequently called for an extension to arts programming - now finds himself fronting Changing Stages, a six-part series about 20th-century theatre. As a tactic for disarming critics, it's rather like inviting the culture secretary to present the new BBC News At Ten. Changing Stages is a courageous project because to many viewers it will look like a pair of dodos huddling together in the scheduling zoo. Theatre and the serious documentary have much in common. Both are cherished by a small, ageing audience but activate the impatience of young commissars who question their ability to survive into the third millennium. Like a barrister defending a terrorist who dabbled in serial killing at weekends, Eyre is making two difficult cases simultaneously. The point was recently made here that - because of the car accident suffered by Robert Hughes, and the age and arthritis of Norman Mailer - BBC2's cultural presenters have been sedentary. Eyre reverses the trend. His walking shots often quicken to a run, and he begins one programme galloping a horse along an Atlantic beach. The first arts presenter who might have need of a stunt double. And Changing Stages successfully overcomes two serious disadvantages. The first is theatre's unfashionability as a subject. In this respect, the series reveals first-night nerves. A theatre audience is captive - social politeness makes even the bored return after the interval. But TV watchers are free spirits. Lose a viewer in the first part of a documentary sextet and they'll be doing something else for the next five Sundays. Understanding this - and that the series is a co-production aimed at even twitchier-fingered Americans - Eyre and director Roger Parsons try, as Greek theatre did, to settle the audience down with a jaunt before the serious themes. Though Shakespeare is the subject of the first programme, the first speakers aren't academics or biographers, but Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, America-friendly actors. The first director to be heard is Baz Luhrmann, whose cinematic Romeo and Juliet solved the problem which torments this opening episode - how to make Shakespeare sexy for a modern audience. Apart from Luhrmann's bravura tangent, the other extract featured in the opening sequence is from Shakespeare in Love. There are fears at this point that that the dollar input has forced the series to present Shakespeare as a Hollywood screenwriter rather than a Stratford actor-manager. But Eyre's intelligence and insight as a director are gradually allowed centre screen. The programme becomes an exercise in genuine popular scholarship, explaining how production styles of Shakespeare in Britain during the last century were first influenced by, and then fought against, codes of social behaviour. Newsreel of Eden quoting Shakespeare during Suez and John Patten being applauded by a Tory conference for promising that every child will learn the Bard illustrates the fight over the national playwright's meaning. Changing Stages also faces the problem that, while painting and architecture perfectly suit the arts documentary - eye and camera see buildings and pictures in much the same way - the camera makes theatre look phoney. The size of voice and gesture required to catch the eyes and ears of an audience in tip-up seats is too big for people sitting on sofas looking at glass. The series begins by making this point about the perishability of theatrical images with a televisual image which will still look good in 20 years. Winter whiteness fills the screen as Eyre, Russian-hatted in a frozen field, tells the legend that Michaelangelo's greatest work was a snow sculpture for the Medicis. All theatre is a statue built from a blizzard, beauty of a few hours. The BBC's previous theatrical documentary epic - Ronald Harwood's All The World's A Stage - commissioned performances of key pieces, but Eyre's illustrations come from movie versions of Shakespeare, Miller and O'Neill. Relying on second-hand pictures of its subject, the series is sometimes over-strenuous in its original images. The fact that Laurence Olivier lived in Brighton prompts an elaborate comparison between his performance style and the resort. But the historical anecdotes are well-chosen - Lilian Baylis cooking bacon in her stage box during performances - and Eyre's directorial connections bring in almost every famous name ever seen on a theatre poster: Gielgud, Miller, Bennett, Hall, Brook, Nunn. Compressing a century's theatre into only slightly more time than a single performance of Hamlet takes to stage inevitably brings the curtain down in front of the enthusiasms of some viewers. Impressive as the third programme is on O'Neill, Miller, Williams and the mid-century Broadway musical, you feel the lack of Mamet and Sondheim. Whether or not all theatre is snow sculpture, a lot of discussion about it can be slush. Richard Eyre, though, is a man who loves theatre but is never a luvvie; in the camp without being camp. Making the case for theatre and the arts documentary series, he gets both his notorious clients off. \u0095 Changing Stages, Sunday, 7pm, BBC2. Second sitting Because of the newspaper convention that repeats are never reviewed, the dread of critics is writing about a piece you don't realise is on its second showing. But these days, I worry more about failing to review a new series because you mistakenly believe it's a repeat. This trap now lies in every Radio Times because of the tendency of successful formats to spawn minor variations. A brand new series is often something you've almost seen before. Flicking through this week's listings, I sagely noted the return of the cookery series Friends For Dinner (Wednesday, 8.30pm, BBC2), in which a top chef turns up to help a civilian cook dinner. Further research, however, reveals that this is apparently a fresh idea. The confusion occurs because it's been thrown together like a Boxing Day lunch from scraps of other cookery and gardening pro-am shows. In the first programme, Angela Wheeler hosts a Home Counties dinner party co-cooked with Jamie Oliver. In pro-am golf, partnerships are decided by handicap. In celebrity-normal cooking, pairings seem influenced by accent, the programme excited by the cheese-and-chocolate opposition of Angela's posh and Jamie's cockney. True to media image, he addresses her as \"mate\". And, disturbingly, the series begins with another sighting of the most irritating documentary intro, also to be found at the start of rural series Clarissa And The Countryman - the surprise meeting which, in fact, has been set up by an officeful of researchers and contract staff. In the country show, Clarissa Dickson-Wright, while herding sheep across a London bridge, affected astonishment at spotting her co-host walking towards her. In Friends For Dinner, Angela goes all wow and gosh when she takes a call revealing that Oliver is on the way. Only a small fraud by the standards of others in TV, but these heavily rehearsed surprises are insulting to viewers and should be dropped.",

      "body": "<p>Jo Evans was furious when Robin Peverett, the prep school headmaster who had indecently assaulted her on a regular basis at school, walked free with an 18-month suspended sentence. \"It wasn't until we got home that it hit us: Peverett was free. This wasn't supposed to happen. Then I was angry. I felt such rage.\"</p> <p>Welcome to the murky world of the plea bargain. Though she didn't know it then, defence and prosecution lawyers had done a deal with the cooperation of the judge. Peverett would plead guilty to nine charges involving seven pupils aged 10 to 13 from 1969 to 1977, but only if he could be sure of escaping prison. And his plea was on the basis that he merely made circles with his hands on his pupils' buttocks or tapped them there - to exert power over them rather than for sexual gratification.</p> <p>Evans and the other former pupils who came forward to accuse the 67-year-old former head of Dulwich College prep school were stunned at the outcome, particularly since the judge had told Peverett that he was guilty of \"an appalling abuse of a position of trust\". They were expecting a four- or five-year prison sentence. But they learned the truth about the shadowy deal only when the attorney general, who also thought the sentence was too light, decided to take the case to the appeal court. Ten days ago Evans and five other victims were in court to hear three senior judges throw it out. Peverett, holder of an OBE, had eluded the final bid to lock him up.</p> <p>Lord Justice Rose called the carve-up that let Peverett go free \"lamentable\". He pointed out that the appeal court had often warned against discussions between judge and counsel about pleas and sentences. \"The public are likely to be affronted by that sort of process and this case graphically illustrates the distress and dissatisfaction that can accrue to defendant and victim,\" he said.</p> <p>But since the crown, in the shape of the Crown Prosecution Service, had made representations to Peverett on which he had relied in pleading guilty, the crown, in the shape of the attorney general - who is, after all, the minister responsible for the CPS - could not be allowed to go back on the deal. Peverett had not been warned, when he agreed to plead guilty, that the appeal court could later impose a prison sentence if the attorney general thought the original sentence \"unduly lenient\".</p> <p>The attorney general, Lord Williams, has promised guidance next month banning discussions with judges about pleas or sentences in all but exceptional cases. He said: \"The public have the view 'What is going on behind the back door? Would such a bargain be available to someone of a different background?'\" Exceptional cases would have to be truly exceptional - for example, where a defendant was dying of cancer but it was felt he should not be told of his prognosis.</p> <p>But will the guidance stop plea bargaining? The appeal court laid down similar guidelines in strong terms as long ago as 1970, in a case called R v Turner. The court told judges that they must not say they would impose one sentence in response to a guilty plea and a more severe sentence for a plea of not guilty, because that put the defendant under undue pressure to plead guilty. But it is clear from a string of cases since then that this shadowy practice still goes on.</p> <p>This month at the bar conference, barristers were asked how many had in the past year gone to see judges in their rooms \"for an indication on sentence\". A sea of hands shot up. Around one in three barristers present had taken part in a plea bargain.</p> <p>The practice persists because, whatever the court of appeal thinks, barristers and judges at the coal face like it. A crown court survey for the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in 1993 found that nearly 90% of barristers and two out of three circuit judges favoured \"full and realistic discussion between counsel and judge about plea and especially sentence\".</p> <p>And while the attorney general wants to outlaw the practice, Lord Justice Auld, the appeal court judge whose review of the criminal courts is due in December, has asked consultees whether, \"to encourage proper pleas of guilty and having regard to the victim's and the public interest\", there should be a clearly defined and formal system of plea bargaining.</p> <p>The Criminal Bar Association supports the idea of such a system, with the defendant, excluded under the current informal system, present for all discussions and the judge stating in court in advance what the alternative sentences would be after a trial, and after a guilty plea. Douglas Day QC, a member of the CBA and part-time judge, says: \"It's worth exploring. The problem at present is that it's not transparent. Everyone walks into the back of the court in a furtive way and the defendant is not involved. It's like the boys getting together in the back room.\"</p> <p>The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice also favoured a formal system, renamed \"sentence canvass\" to distance it from the shady image of plea bargaining. In the presence of prosecution counsel in the judge's chambers, defence counsel could ask the judge one question: \"What would be the maximum sentence if my client were to plead guilty at this stage?\"</p> <p>Day points out: \"The best legal advice can only be given when all the relevant facts are known. In a criminal trial the sentence of the court is generally the most relevant fact to the defendant. A fully transparent system which involves the defendant at every stage would not be unfair.\"</p> <p>Michael Zander, emeritus professor of law at LSE, who was a member of the royal commission and carried out its crown court survey, thinks a plea-bargaining system is \"inevitable\". He says: \"Everyone benefits. The defendant benefits in getting a reduced sentence, the prosecution benefits in getting a conviction and a reasonable sentence, the system benefits in securing a guilty plea without the cost of a trial, and witnesses are spared having to give evidence.</p> <p>\"But everything depends on the judge supervising it. Providing the judge is watching out for inappropriate deals, it serves everyone's interests.\" He concedes there is pressure on defendants to plead guilty but feels this is inevitable if a guilty plea is to be rewarded with a sentence discount.</p> <p>In the crown court survey it initially appeared that there were a number of cases where innocent defendants had pleaded guilty to get a lighter sentence. \"But when these were investigated, it turned out there were hardly any. I don't think it's a major risk, but there is a risk. To pretend there isn't pressure in the system is nonsense.\"</p> <p>The royal commission's recommendation for a formal, open plea-bargaining system \"went down like a lead balloon\" with the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, recalls Zander. \"Peter Taylor said, 'Absolutely not.' The court of appeal views the case at a distance. They get the cases where it's gone wrong. The judges in the crown court are anxious to dispose of cases efficiently and may therefore be willing to have such discussions more often than the appeal judges would like.\"</p>",

This month at the bar conference, barristers were asked how many had in the past year gone to see judges in their rooms \"for an indication on sentence\". A sea of hands shot up. Around one in three barristers present had taken part in a plea bargain. The practice persists because, whatever the court of appeal thinks, barristers and judges at the coal face like it. A crown court survey for the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in 1993 found that nearly 90% of barristers and two out of three circuit judges favoured \"full and realistic discussion between counsel and judge about plea and especially sentence\". And while the attorney general wants to outlaw the practice, Lord Justice Auld, the appeal court judge whose review of the criminal courts is due in December, has asked consultees whether, \"to encourage proper pleas of guilty and having regard to the victim's and the public interest\", there should be a clearly defined and formal system of plea bargaining. The Criminal Bar Association supports the idea of such a system, with the defendant, excluded under the current informal system, present for all discussions and the judge stating in court in advance what the alternative sentences would be after a trial, and after a guilty plea. Douglas Day QC, a member of the CBA and part-time judge, says: \"It's worth exploring. The problem at present is that it's not transparent. Everyone walks into the back of the court in a furtive way and the defendant is not involved. It's like the boys getting together in the back room.\" The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice also favoured a formal system, renamed \"sentence canvass\" to distance it from the shady image of plea bargaining. In the presence of prosecution counsel in the judge's chambers, defence counsel could ask the judge one question: \"What would be the maximum sentence if my client were to plead guilty at this stage?\" Day points out: \"The best legal advice can only be given when all the relevant facts are known. In a criminal trial the sentence of the court is generally the most relevant fact to the defendant. A fully transparent system which involves the defendant at every stage would not be unfair.\" Michael Zander, emeritus professor of law at LSE, who was a member of the royal commission and carried out its crown court survey, thinks a plea-bargaining system is \"inevitable\". He says: \"Everyone benefits. The defendant benefits in getting a reduced sentence, the prosecution benefits in getting a conviction and a reasonable sentence, the system benefits in securing a guilty plea without the cost of a trial, and witnesses are spared having to give evidence. \"But everything depends on the judge supervising it. Providing the judge is watching out for inappropriate deals, it serves everyone's interests.\" He concedes there is pressure on defendants to plead guilty but feels this is inevitable if a guilty plea is to be rewarded with a sentence discount. In the crown court survey it initially appeared that there were a number of cases where innocent defendants had pleaded guilty to get a lighter sentence. \"But when these were investigated, it turned out there were hardly any. I don't think it's a major risk, but there is a risk. To pretend there isn't pressure in the system is nonsense.\" The royal commission's recommendation for a formal, open plea-bargaining system \"went down like a lead balloon\" with the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, recalls Zander. \"Peter Taylor said, 'Absolutely not.' The court of appeal views the case at a distance. They get the cases where it's gone wrong. The judges in the crown court are anxious to dispose of cases efficiently and may therefore be willing to have such discussions more often than the appeal judges would like.\"",

      "body": "<p>The economic backdrop to next week's pre-Budget report could hardly be brighter. Inflation is below the government's 2.5% target despite more than eight years of strong growth and an ever-tightening labour market, the current account is widening but not at an alarming pace and the public finances are in good shape. </p> <p>With an election possibly just over six months away, the temptation for Gordon Brown to \"do a Lawson\" and conclude he has achieved an economic miracle must be intense. Thankfully, the chancellor signalled last week at the G20 finance ministers' meeting in Montreal that he would not be bounced into a rash pre-election giveaway. </p> <p>Mr Brown's caution is well founded. True, estimates of the likely budget surplus this year range from the Treasury's ultra-cautious \u00a35bn to well over \u00a320bn. In all likelihood, Mr Brown will be forced to revise upwards his forecast given the outturn for the first six months of the year shows a surplus of \u00a34.6bn. But continued modesty in his projections is to be welcomed. </p> <p>However, the British economy has been here before and it did not end happily. As Nigel Lawson demonstrated in the late 80s, it is easy to be deceived by a temporary improvement in public finances. Then, with money flooding into the exchequer, Mr Lawson slashed taxes in the belief that the economy's sustainable growth rate had shifted up a gear, only to leave his successors with a hole in the public finances when the UK went into recession. </p> <p>Today's situation is not dissimilar. Since Black Wednesday, the economy has been full of good surprises. It is tempting to believe that the supply side reforms of the 80s are beginning to pay off in terms of an increase of the economy's sustainable growth rate from its historic trend of 2.25%-2.5%. Estimates of 3% do not seem unreasonable. </p> <p>But it may also be true that low inflation is due to what Lawrence Meyer, a Federal Reserve board member, has in the US context called \"temporary bliss\" factors, such as the pound's surprising strength on the foreign exchanges, the massive deflationary impulse from the Asian crisis or the (previously) low oil price. In other words, luck rather than good policies may be responsible for the economy's remarkable performance. </p> <p>Faced with this uncertainty, it seems sensible to proceed with caution, basing forecasts for the public finances on a trend rate of growth of 2.25% and using any spare cash which accumulates to pay down debt rather than substantially increase spending or cut taxes just yet. </p> <p>Professor Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's national economic adviser during his first term, was in London last week to deliver the Economic and Social Research Council's annual lecture. She reminded the audience that one of the foundation stones of America's new economy was the decision to cut the budget deficit in the early 90s. It made room for an easier monetary policy which, in turn, created a climate in the capital markets supportive of IT investment. And IT investment appears to have been one of the main ingredients of the US's productivity miracle which everyone from Japan to Germany is trying to copy. </p> <p>None of this prevents the chancellor distributing a few few fiscal lollipops next week. The margin of error built into projections of the public finances using a growth yardstick of 2.25% means Mr Brown can afford to make some minor concessions without endangering the long-term health of the public finances. He has already signalled that there will be some extra help for pensioners to make up for the infamous 75p increase last year. It is likelypensioners will be granted a temporary above-inflation rise to tide them over to the introduction in 2003 of a new pensioner credit, details of which are expected to be outlined next week. But there will be no permanent restoration of the link between earnings and pensions. </p> <p>Hauliers and the rural lobby can also expect to be grudgingly bought off with targeted measures such as rebates off fuel duty but their demand for a real-terms cut in petrol duty is likely to be ignored. Not only would it send the wrong signal about the government's attitude to the environment, it could also add too much pressure to demand when there is still a danger of higher interest rates. Standing up to the petrol protesters will be politically risky but a repeat of such a spontaneous event as September's fuel crisis seems unlikely, especially if public sympathy is watered down by top-up spending on health and education. This ought to be possible by switching money saved elsewhere in the Budget on unemployment or debt interest. </p> <p>From the chancellor's point of view, however, the meat of the report will be a range of micro measures designed to improve productivity, a yawn for the average voter but, in the long run, the key to preventing the tightness of the labour market spilling over into inflation. </p> <p>Generally speaking, two models of productivity are on offer: the European one, which succeeds by keeping unproductive people out of the workforce (downside: high unemployment); and the American one, which give all available workers lots of capital to work with but treats them like drones (downside: long hours and unhappy people). </p> <p>Mr Brown is trying to steer a middle path, introducing a wide range of measures to get more people into workforce, such as the New Deal, and improve their skills and employability through investment in education and training. </p> <p>He is also continually devising new ways of persuading the private sector to step up investment spending. The public and private sectors working together will, in theory, achieve a productivity breakthrough that will close the gap with the US, France and Germany. </p> <p>Micro initiatives can be expected from Mr Brown next week, including publication of the interim report by Paul Myners on the fund management industry which is likely to recommend reform or abolition of the minimum funding requirement, seen by the Treasury as a barrier to investment in venture capital. Mr Brown will also announce plans for a tax credit encouraging investors to put money into cash-starved entrepreneurial activity in poor urban and rural areas. </p> <p>Compared to the productivity improvements being forced on businesses by the strong pound (the government's unspoken policy for persuading manufacturing to raise its game), such schemes will achieve only marginal gains but they extract little cost and therefore seem worth trying. The trick Mr Brown appears to be attempting to pull off is to appear very busy while doing little that can cause harm. </p> <p>In the short term such a strategy may lack political excitement and, in the eyes of some, courage but in the long run it could reap big rewards. If the public finances continue to improve at the current rate, by next March's Budget Mr Brown could be able to offer modest, affordable tax cuts and hold out the the promise of a second Labour term characterised by further substantial increases in public spending. By holding his nerve, Mr Brown is likely to be in a position to spend a lot more in the future. Judging by his comments in Canada last week, he has realised this. Let's hope Number 10 has, too.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The economic backdrop to next week's pre-Budget report could hardly be brighter. Inflation is below the government's 2.5% target despite more than eight years of strong growth and an ever-tightening labour market, the current account is widening but not at an alarming pace and the public finances are in good shape. With an election possibly just over six months away, the temptation for Gordon Brown to \"do a Lawson\" and conclude he has achieved an economic miracle must be intense. Thankfully, the chancellor signalled last week at the G20 finance ministers' meeting in Montreal that he would not be bounced into a rash pre-election giveaway. Mr Brown's caution is well founded. True, estimates of the likely budget surplus this year range from the Treasury's ultra-cautious \u00a35bn to well over \u00a320bn. In all likelihood, Mr Brown will be forced to revise upwards his forecast given the outturn for the first six months of the year shows a surplus of \u00a34.6bn. But continued modesty in his projections is to be welcomed. However, the British economy has been here before and it did not end happily. As Nigel Lawson demonstrated in the late 80s, it is easy to be deceived by a temporary improvement in public finances. Then, with money flooding into the exchequer, Mr Lawson slashed taxes in the belief that the economy's sustainable growth rate had shifted up a gear, only to leave his successors with a hole in the public finances when the UK went into recession. Today's situation is not dissimilar. Since Black Wednesday, the economy has been full of good surprises. It is tempting to believe that the supply side reforms of the 80s are beginning to pay off in terms of an increase of the economy's sustainable growth rate from its historic trend of 2.25%-2.5%. Estimates of 3% do not seem unreasonable. But it may also be true that low inflation is due to what Lawrence Meyer, a Federal Reserve board member, has in the US context called \"temporary bliss\" factors, such as the pound's surprising strength on the foreign exchanges, the massive deflationary impulse from the Asian crisis or the (previously) low oil price. In other words, luck rather than good policies may be responsible for the economy's remarkable performance. Faced with this uncertainty, it seems sensible to proceed with caution, basing forecasts for the public finances on a trend rate of growth of 2.25% and using any spare cash which accumulates to pay down debt rather than substantially increase spending or cut taxes just yet. Professor Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's national economic adviser during his first term, was in London last week to deliver the Economic and Social Research Council's annual lecture. She reminded the audience that one of the foundation stones of America's new economy was the decision to cut the budget deficit in the early 90s. It made room for an easier monetary policy which, in turn, created a climate in the capital markets supportive of IT investment. And IT investment appears to have been one of the main ingredients of the US's productivity miracle which everyone from Japan to Germany is trying to copy. None of this prevents the chancellor distributing a few few fiscal lollipops next week. The margin of error built into projections of the public finances using a growth yardstick of 2.25% means Mr Brown can afford to make some minor concessions without endangering the long-term health of the public finances. He has already signalled that there will be some extra help for pensioners to make up for the infamous 75p increase last year. It is likelypensioners will be granted a temporary above-inflation rise to tide them over to the introduction in 2003 of a new pensioner credit, details of which are expected to be outlined next week. But there will be no permanent restoration of the link between earnings and pensions. Hauliers and the rural lobby can also expect to be grudgingly bought off with targeted measures such as rebates off fuel duty but their demand for a real-terms cut in petrol duty is likely to be ignored. Not only would it send the wrong signal about the government's attitude to the environment, it could also add too much pressure to demand when there is still a danger of higher interest rates. Standing up to the petrol protesters will be politically risky but a repeat of such a spontaneous event as September's fuel crisis seems unlikely, especially if public sympathy is watered down by top-up spending on health and education. This ought to be possible by switching money saved elsewhere in the Budget on unemployment or debt interest. From the chancellor's point of view, however, the meat of the report will be a range of micro measures designed to improve productivity, a yawn for the average voter but, in the long run, the key to preventing the tightness of the labour market spilling over into inflation. Generally speaking, two models of productivity are on offer: the European one, which succeeds by keeping unproductive people out of the workforce (downside: high unemployment); and the American one, which give all available workers lots of capital to work with but treats them like drones (downside: long hours and unhappy people). Mr Brown is trying to steer a middle path, introducing a wide range of measures to get more people into workforce, such as the New Deal, and improve their skills and employability through investment in education and training. He is also continually devising new ways of persuading the private sector to step up investment spending. The public and private sectors working together will, in theory, achieve a productivity breakthrough that will close the gap with the US, France and Germany. Micro initiatives can be expected from Mr Brown next week, including publication of the interim report by Paul Myners on the fund management industry which is likely to recommend reform or abolition of the minimum funding requirement, seen by the Treasury as a barrier to investment in venture capital. Mr Brown will also announce plans for a tax credit encouraging investors to put money into cash-starved entrepreneurial activity in poor urban and rural areas. Compared to the productivity improvements being forced on businesses by the strong pound (the government's unspoken policy for persuading manufacturing to raise its game), such schemes will achieve only marginal gains but they extract little cost and therefore seem worth trying. The trick Mr Brown appears to be attempting to pull off is to appear very busy while doing little that can cause harm. In the short term such a strategy may lack political excitement and, in the eyes of some, courage but in the long run it could reap big rewards. If the public finances continue to improve at the current rate, by next March's Budget Mr Brown could be able to offer modest, affordable tax cuts and hold out the the promise of a second Labour term characterised by further substantial increases in public spending. By holding his nerve, Mr Brown is likely to be in a position to spend a lot more in the future. Judging by his comments in Canada last week, he has realised this. Let's hope Number 10 has, too.",

      "bodyText": "I admired Carlo Gesualdo's music long before I knew anything of the disturbed personality of this 16th-century Composer Of The Week (9.0am, Radio 3). As Prince of Venosa he married his cousin for dynastic reasons and apparently lost interest in her once she produced an heir. However, when she took a lover, Gesualdo had both murdered. His aristocratic status averted a prosecution but he withdrew into manic depression, from which emerged his wonderfully innovative scores, including six books of highly original madrigals. Professor Peter Hennessy completes his study of The Top Job (8.0pm, Radio 4) with party leaders who arrived in Downing Street with that messianic gleam in their eye. The most recent example, of course, was the Iron Lady, who sacrificed sacred cows until one finally trampled over her. Harold Wilson discovered that the white heat of technology could cause a nasty burn. Clem Attlee rarely said much, but successfully changed British society to its roots.",

She didn't stay long, she probably moved to another refuge. Some move when their men find them, most are waiting for a house.\" The refuge has six bedrooms and a shared bathroom, kitchen and living room; it also houses the Women's Aid offices. Around 200 women and 250 children pass through this refuge each year. Many arrive badly beaten; late-night calls come from the local hospital's casualty ward and beds have to be found at short notice. Women are given a room when they arrive and if they have no belongings, they can rummage through the attic to find some clothes. Each has her own space in the kitchen and at busy times, they draw up a schedule.</p> <p>* Some of Liza Hamlyn's photographs were simply snapshots, preserving a brief moment of a particular tragedy: a boy who is missing his dad lies face down in tears on the sofa; two women grin broadly and embrace as one leaves the hostel. Others are more posed, like the one on the right, of a mother and her two daughters. \"She had been in a very bad relationship and suffered long-term abuse,\" Hamlyn says. \"This photograph shows her in the living room of the refuge, a week before she left. She is divorced now and has her own house.\" Hamlyn spent five or six hours with the woman, getting to know her while taking the photographs. The resulting picture echoes the kind of staged, professional family portrait that hangs in many suburban homes - but without the father figure.</p> <p>* Sometimes the refuge takes the women and children out on trips, especially during school holidays. They go to parks and local leisure centres. One mother and daughter pictured had been out for a walk one rainy day in August. This was the second time the woman had left home with her two children after suffering severe abuse from her partner - the first time, he found her. \"She has moved now and changed her name,\" Hamlyn says. \"Her life's just a bit more normal now, but back then it was hard for the kids, they were very confused. They missed their dad, even though he was not a good thing for them.\" There is an on-site child support worker and the children have been resettled at a nearby school. The education of children from backgrounds of abuse often suffers from the lack of stability</p> <p>* Another woman shown had betrayed her community by speaking out about domestic violence. She has since left the refuge, divorced her husband and married a non-Asian man. She is photographed holding a picture of her children because, Hamlyn says, \"since leaving her husband, she has been ostracised by some members of her community and is not allowed to see her kids\". Twenty-one per cent of the women who come into the hostel are Asian. \"They are taught to be modest and to respect authority, and they are acutely aware of the importance of family honour,\" Hamlyn says. \"They fear racism and rejection if they leave the home.\" Since 1995, there have been at least 20 \"honour\" killings in Britain. Many women suffer abuse both from their husbands and from their extended family.</p> <p>* A member of staff is on call at the refuge at night and at weekends, and its 12 staff work closely with local police.</p> <p>Hamlyn was asked by Women's Aid not to reveal the location of the refuge and many of the photographs she took cannot be shown on these pages, for fear that the women shown might be identified by the husbands and families they have fled.

      "body": "<p>Orange, the mobile phone operator poised for a \u00a355bn flotation next year, is expected to have its primary listing in Paris to avoid capital gains tax liabilities in Britain. </p> <p>Senior management figures fear the current restructuring at Orange, which was bought by France Telecom for \u00a331bn in May, could lead to hefty payment demands if the new company is registered in London. </p> <p>This reorganisation consists of demerging France Telecom's mobile phone assets, principally the domestic network Itineris and interests across mainland Europe, into the group, dubbed New Orange. </p> <p>The future of Hans Snook, the eccentric chief executive credited with turning Orange into a leading player within the telecoms industry, also remains uncertain. </p> <p>Earlier this month it was said he would become executive chairman of the enlarged group and make way for Jean-Francois Pontal, installed by France Telecom, who would take over the day-to-day running of the business. </p> <p>But weekend reports, quoting French analysts, suggested Mr Snook would quit Orange as a result of the primary listing switching to Paris. </p> <p>They speculated that the French government, which is still France Telecom's largest shareholder, would expect the company to have a French chairman if it was registered in Paris. </p> <p>Last night a spokesman for Mr Snook vigorously denied he was planning to depart and refused to speculate on rumours he could be lined up for a different role within Orange. </p> <p>\"It's certainly not true that he is leaving,\" he said. \"The management structure will be announced in due course and will make clear the position of everyone.\" </p> <p>This restructuring is expected to be announced before the end of the year. </p> <p>A spokesman for Orange, which has 8.3m subscribers in Britain, declined to comment on where the company would have its primary listing. </p> <p>France Telecom is expected to float some 15% of New Orange and raise 14bn euros. Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale are handling the flotation. </p> <p>The City had originally expected the flotation by the end of this year, but it was announced earlier this month that the public offering was being delayed until early 2001. </p> <p>Michel Bon, chairman of France Telecom, said the decision had been taken because of the complexities of joining 15 companies into one entity. </p> <p>It was also hoped the delay would allow the swing in mar ket sentiment against mobile phone businesses, coupled with turbulence among all telecoms and technology stocks, to subside. The value of the float largely depends on the investors' view of the telecoms industry at the time. </p> <p>If it goes ahead as planned, New Orange will be Europe's largest mobile phone group behind Vodafone, with 30m subscribers and interests in Italy and Germany. </p> <p>\u0095 Ireland's Eircom has all but rejected Denis O'Brien's 2.25 billion euros ($1.87 billion) bid made public last week for its fixed-line business and the entrepreneur will have to pay closer to three billion to succeed, industry sources said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Orange, the mobile phone operator poised for a \u00a355bn flotation next year, is expected to have its primary listing in Paris to avoid capital gains tax liabilities in Britain. Senior management figures fear the current restructuring at Orange, which was bought by France Telecom for \u00a331bn in May, could lead to hefty payment demands if the new company is registered in London. This reorganisation consists of demerging France Telecom's mobile phone assets, principally the domestic network Itineris and interests across mainland Europe, into the group, dubbed New Orange. The future of Hans Snook, the eccentric chief executive credited with turning Orange into a leading player within the telecoms industry, also remains uncertain. Earlier this month it was said he would become executive chairman of the enlarged group and make way for Jean-Francois Pontal, installed by France Telecom, who would take over the day-to-day running of the business. But weekend reports, quoting French analysts, suggested Mr Snook would quit Orange as a result of the primary listing switching to Paris. They speculated that the French government, which is still France Telecom's largest shareholder, would expect the company to have a French chairman if it was registered in Paris. Last night a spokesman for Mr Snook vigorously denied he was planning to depart and refused to speculate on rumours he could be lined up for a different role within Orange. \"It's certainly not true that he is leaving,\" he said. \"The management structure will be announced in due course and will make clear the position of everyone.\" This restructuring is expected to be announced before the end of the year. A spokesman for Orange, which has 8.3m subscribers in Britain, declined to comment on where the company would have its primary listing. France Telecom is expected to float some 15% of New Orange and raise 14bn euros. Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale are handling the flotation. The City had originally expected the flotation by the end of this year, but it was announced earlier this month that the public offering was being delayed until early 2001. Michel Bon, chairman of France Telecom, said the decision had been taken because of the complexities of joining 15 companies into one entity. It was also hoped the delay would allow the swing in mar ket sentiment against mobile phone businesses, coupled with turbulence among all telecoms and technology stocks, to subside. The value of the float largely depends on the investors' view of the telecoms industry at the time. If it goes ahead as planned, New Orange will be Europe's largest mobile phone group behind Vodafone, with 30m subscribers and interests in Italy and Germany. \u0095 Ireland's Eircom has all but rejected Denis O'Brien's 2.25 billion euros ($1.87 billion) bid made public last week for its fixed-line business and the entrepreneur will have to pay closer to three billion to succeed, industry sources said.",

      "body": "<p>Thomas Keneally takes an unprecious view of his new novel, Bettany's Book, which he calls \"the last act of bravado by an ugly old sexist bastard from Australia\", issuing a filthy cackle that resonates like a motorbike engine and lifts him clean out of his seat. A troll-like 64-year-old with tombstone teeth and whiskers on his chin, he is more like a creation of the science fantasy writer Terry Pratchett than the revered author of Schindler's Ark. </p> <p>The \"bravado\" of Bettany's Book is that it is written from the perspective of two beautiful sisters, Dimple and Primrose Bettany, a feat of imagination that even its author admits to having found a little stretching. Like the best self-deprecators, Keneally mocks himself in a manner that only amplifies his charm. \"The great thing about Britain, as opposed to a muscular country like Australia, is that you can stay indoors and just be a portly gent,\" he says, fondly contemplating his girth and explaining that beauty, though he has never possessed it, has always fascinated him. </p> <p>Bettany's Book is 600 pages long, which by Keneally's reckoning \"just sneaks in under the limit of what's tolerable\". It is ambitious, unfolding on two continents and in two centuries, modern Sudan and 1830s Australia. The issues it tackles are huge: the politics of food distribution (\"the question of whether famine is an act of god or an act of politics\"), land ownership (\"If we are so enamoured of Australia after three or four generations, imagine what a sense of possession the Aborigines have after 12,500 generations?\") and the real biggie, original sin. \"It's the old sense of temptation being at the heart of every great virtue that we inherited from you blokes.\" </p> <p>He draws breath for a moment. \"Madam, your next question.\" </p> <p>The aim of the book was to redeem the history of the Australian outback from the damage done to it by bad schooling. \"As children, we were raised to do projects on wool, and it always bored the crap out of us,\" he says. He considered splitting this and the Sudanese material into two books, but his publishers dissuaded him, confident that he is at his best when at the helm of a sweeping epic. </p> <p>They were right. All Keneally's big \"issue\" books - Nazi genocide in Schindler's Ark, the Irish diaspora in The River Town and The Great Shame (cut from 2,000 to 600 pages) and now Bettany's Book, are deliv ered from worthiness by an ironic touch that has him introducing his latest protagonist as \"Sir Jonathan Bettany, great man of sheep\", and congratulating the Bettany sisters' parents for dying an \"exemplary death\". The story travels between Sudan and Australia via the conceit of Prim obtaining a job in an aid agency and Dimp stumbling across her great grandfather's journal, through which is told the story of Australia's convict pioneers. </p> <p>Keneally insists that this is not as random a juxtaposition as it seems. \"Most Australians wouldn't see any connection between themselves and a country like the Sudan,\" he says. \"But there is this one.\" </p> <p>The connection is post-colonial identity, a subject the author is loath to make too much of lest he tumble into the arms of pretension or be accused of \"pom-bashing\". None the less, he says, just as Sudan struggled to redefine itself, culturally and territorially, after British rule ended in 1956, so Australia derives edginess from its status as an ex-penal colony. </p> <p>\"Behind that assertiveness is an insecurity. The participation of a lot of Australians in the two world wars was down to that, I think. My wife's eldest brother flew 90 missions in bomber command before the age of 22 - 90 missions! Preposterous bravado - and when I asked him why, he said: 'I wanted to show 'em what Australians are made of.' That impulse to show the Brits that Australians had turned out well, had moral fibre, I'm sure derives in part from the stain of convictism.\" </p> <p>Keneally's own ancestors were Irish convicts exported to New South Wales in the mid-19th century. John Keneally, his great uncle, was a political prisoner convicted in Ireland for his republicanism - something his great nephew looks on warmly in light of his own politics - and eventually pardoned by Gladstone. To Keneally the writer, such a history is a gift. But to the child in Sydney it was an unenviable background. \"This was not looked upon as an inheritance of which to be proud,\" he says, wryly. \"It took a little time for Australians to understand they had an idiosyncratic social history of which much could be made.\" </p> <p>All of this makes Keneally, Australian descendant of Irish Catholics, an unlikely chronicler of European Jewry's darkest hour. When Schindler's Ark was published in 1982, it was greeted sceptically in some quarters as the work of a man who had no \"claim\" on the story. Similarly, his knowledge of Sudan is based on half a dozen stopovers on the way to visit a friend in Eritrea and a long time spent researching on the internet. \"Writers are such arrogant pricks that they only need to know a little bit about something and they'll write a bloody book about it,\" he says. </p> <p>Despite such bullishness, the question of ownership is one Keneally takes seriously. In Bettany's Book, he protects himself from accusations of arrogance by filtering his observations about Africa through a narrator from his own culture. He believes there are limits to where his imagination can decently take him. \"When I was young, I wrote a novel called the Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, which was about Aboriginal Australians [It was also made into a film]. I would not dare write such a book now, because there are so many splendid Aboriginal Australian writers.\" </p> <p>What he doesn't countenance is the writing school ethic of sticking to what you know. \"I find it surprising even a little reckless, that I undertook the project of writing about the Sudan. But I believe writers should be reckless. The old proposition that you should only write about what you know is wrong, because I believe that you don't know what you know until you've written it.\" </p> <p>Any doubts about Keneally's virtuosity as the right man to have written Schindler's Ark, were swept aside by the novel's phenomenal success: it won the Booker prize the year it was published and 11 years later was made into a multi-Oscar winning film by Steven Spielberg. In the aftermath of the film, Keneally was inundated with requests from aggrieved races the world over, begging him to \"do\" their stories. </p> <p>This tickled him, the notion that you could be coldly commissioned to write a story rather than being ambushed by it. He is a great believer in that pseudo-religious experience, much favoured by writers, of being \"seized\" by a narrative. It is this, he says, which explains his choice of subjects. \"It is like being in love. I had no right to get seized by the Schindler story but I became obsessed by it.\" </p> <p>It was the obsession that vaulted Keneally from his status as a critically acclaimed but relatively obscure author, to one of mass appeal. Schindler's Ark, republished after the film's release as Schindler's List, was one of the 20 best-selling fiction titles of the 90s, selling more than 600,000 copies in Britain and spending 20 weeks in the bestseller list. The anti-climax that inevitably followed was lessened for Keneally, by the long gap between the writing of the book and the making of the film - he knocked out another six titles in the interim. </p> <p>Still, it is the book he is likely to be remembered for, a fact he is cheerfully ambivalent about. \"All writers hate to be typecast by the one book of theirs that everyone knows. But it gives us something to do in our old age, which is try to unseat that book, to get another book on our epitaph.\" </p> <p>Keneally's \"old-age\" is spent in a house on the beach, near Sydney, with his wife Judy and their two grown-up daughters. He is involved in the local surf club, where he feeds his inferiority complex by hanging out with lifeguards who can swim \"half way to New Zealand\" to pluck some tourist out of the surf and deposit her on safely on the sand. He is involved in various constitutional movements, produces journalism, accompanies his wife and daughters, all \"world-class shoppers\", on expeditions. The trick of being a good writer, he says, is to find the \"right degree of distraction\". </p> <p>Does writing make him feel more beautiful, I wonder? \"In my case, writing delivers me from plainness, yes, and ageing and all that stuff. It delivers me from a sense of the imminence of death, too, so it's a bit like a drug. It doesn't necessarily make me happy, because it's too solitary for my tastes. But writing is a way of potentially redeeming oneself from the passage of time and from the reality of one's own ordinariness.\" </p> <p>It is this that Bettany's Book does for Keneally's country. \"Bettany is a hero ancestor, taking all his human ambiguity into the vacant space that so intrigued the European imagination. I wanted to explore his wonderment at the ...\" he pauses, searching for the right term, cracks a grin. \"At the dreaming of sheep.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Bettany's Book is published by Sceptre next month.</p>",

Pubmaster is also looking at pubs on offer from rival brewers Bass and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley , but its main target is Whitbread's operations, the report said. NTL , the UK's largest cable company, is examining plans to float its business division. Chief executive Barclay Knapp is said to believe that the financial markets have failed to value NTL properly, with analysts too focused on the company's cable TV distribution platform at the expense of its other divisions, it said. Sunday Times Plans for the effective break-up of BT are expected in about two weeks. Pressure to resolve the future of the business increased again last week after BT's failure to win a UMTS mobile licence in Italy. Some of BT's City advisers are arguing that it is untenable for BT to report third-quarter results on November 9 without addressing strategic issues. The Post Office will this week announce plans for a assault on the home-shopping market in an attempt to dominate this growth sector. It is set to launch a six-month trial covering about 5% of its 18,500 outlets in an attempt to revolutionise the delivery of goods ordered over the internet. Sunday Telegraph Department store group John Lewis Partnership has appointed an external design consultancy to consider how to freshen up the chain's image. Design consultant Pentagram has been asked to conduct an audit of the group's image - looking at everything from its logo to signs, packaging, carrier bags, stationery and even the famous green colour scheme. David Montgomery, the former chief executive of the Mirror Group, will this week be appointed chairman of African Lakes in a move to reshape the former trading company as a technology and internet business. In a separate move, African Lakes will also announce it is buying out a minority 36% stake in its main subsidiary, Africa Online , the internet service provider, for \u00a38m. Mail on Sunday Cable company NTL is poised to launch a price war in the UK home internet market by slashing the cost of high-speed access to the worldwide web. Cable customers could soon be offered 24-hour internet connections for as little as \u00a35 a month. The company is carrying out local trials to see how customers respond to a range of prices and speeds that would dramatically reduce the cost of broadband internet. Sunday Express The watchdog Consumers' Association will go the high court in the latest stage of its battle with Axa over claims the insurance giant has wrongfully kept nearly \u00a32bn of payments made by policyholders.

In order to cover payouts to policyholders in the event of unexpected turmoil on world markets, insurance companies have traditionally put funds aside, known as an \"orphan estate\", over the past 30 or 40 years.

      "body": "<p>The obstetrician and gynaecologist Peter Huntingford, who has died aged 71, was a charismatic teacher, a first-class researcher, an excellent surgeon, a brilliant communicator and an innovator ahead of his time. On the issue of abortion, he was an outspoken supporter of a woman's right to choose, and his contribution to the changed climate in maternity care is incalculable.</p> <p>Huntingford was born at home in Walworth, south London. He presented as a breech and was delivered by the district midwife, weighing 9lbs. Dr Ronnie Laing might well have linked his unusual birth (only 3% of babies at term present bottom first) with his unconventional career path.</p> <p>He was evacuated at the beginning of the second world war, and this experience was emotionally traumatic for him. Secondary school at Dame Alice Owen's, Islington, was followed by medical training at the London hospital medical college, where he qualified with honours in surgery, and obstetrics and gynaecology in 1953. Tuberculosis, which he developed as a medical student, was treated successfully in a Swiss sanatorium, where he learnt German and met the woman who became his first wife.</p> <p>Huntingford lectured at Charing Cross hospital from 1958-61, then became senior lecturer and honorary consultant at St Thomas's hospital. He worked in the new field of perinatal medicine and helped to develop foetal monitoring. In 1965, he was appointed to St Mary's hospital, Paddington - at the age of 36, the youngest professor in his speciality - and was assistant editor of what is now the British Journal Of Obstetrics And Gynaecology.</p> <p>He was a founder member of several influential bodies, such as the Blair Bell Research Society in 1962 (where he was active as an officer until 1971), the Anglo-German Medical Society in 1961, and the European Society of Perinatal Medicine in 1968. From 1965-71, he was secretary to the Medical Research Council working party on the prevention of rhesus iso-immunisation during pregnancy, an initiative which has almost eliminated perinatal deaths from this cause.</p> <p>He published more than 70 scientific papers during this period, as well as contributing to medical textbooks and making tape-slide programmes for teaching medical students.</p> <p>This brilliant and productive academic career led to Huntingford being asked by the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (Spuc) to allow his name to be used on its letterhead. Spuc was formed after the passage of the 1967 Abortion Act to fight against its provisions, and Peter, as one who had done research designed to improve foetal survival and wellbeing, was seen as a natural ally.</p> <p>Huntingford, however, was an obstetrician and gynaecologist who listened to women, and he came to believe that they should make their own decisions about their bodies. He was fortunate in having as his senior lecturer at St Mary's, David Paintin, who had worked in Aberdeen with Dugald Baird, and was a quiet advocate of a woman's right to choose. Peter became an outspoken and high-profile supporter of the pro-choice movement. This capacity to change his mind endeared him to his friends, but also made him enemies.</p> <p>In 1970, he left his chair to work for the World Health Organisation as adviser in maternal and child health in south-east Asia. By then, his first marriage had ended in divorce and he had married his second wife, Diane.</p> <p>Returning to Britain in 1974, he was appointed, as professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, to head the joint academic department of the London hospital and St Bartholemew's hospital medical colleges. He took this post on the understanding that he was not going to do research, but apply the knowledge that he had gained to provide a good service for women.</p> <p>Huntingford set up the Tower Hamlets day-care abortion service in 1977, and worked with GPs to encourage them to take part in maternity care. He started a domino scheme in which the GPs and midwives looked after women delivered in hospital and transferred them home after six hours. He supported home births - which was not then the policy of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</p> <p>He advised the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the Family Planning Association, and chaired the Pregnancy Advisory Service, then one of the two non-national health service abortion providers. He gave evidence to the Lane Commission on the working of the Abortion Act, and was unstinting in his support for women to have a choice about whether or not they had a baby, and how they gave birth.</p> <p>Huntingford moved from the main teaching hospital at Whitechapel to the greener and less pressured Mile End hospital. There, he was able to provide the kind of service that women wanted - and he wanted for them. His attitude to student teaching was far ahead of the time; he sat with the students, and they wrote the aims and objectives of their course (this was before I was appointed as senior lecturer, in 1977, and helped to provide a structured course).</p> <p>Peter felt that the attitude of the doctor - and thus of the medical student - was of crucial importance in look ing after women; he was teaching this 20 years before the General Medical Council published Good Medical Practice and Tomorrow's Doctors, with their emphasis on good communication and partnership with patients.</p> <p>In 1981, he resigned his chair and took up an NHS consultant post in Maidstone, in a unit without registrars, where he worked until he retired, aged 60. His dedication to his patients was exemplified by his walking the seven miles to work during the 1987 storm, when the roads were impassable.</p> <p>Peter realised the potential of mass media to get his message across, and was an accomplished performer. In 1984-85, he presented the influential television programme, Birth Right: The Parent's Choice.

      "bodyText": "The obstetrician and gynaecologist Peter Huntingford, who has died aged 71, was a charismatic teacher, a first-class researcher, an excellent surgeon, a brilliant communicator and an innovator ahead of his time. On the issue of abortion, he was an outspoken supporter of a woman's right to choose, and his contribution to the changed climate in maternity care is incalculable. Huntingford was born at home in Walworth, south London. He presented as a breech and was delivered by the district midwife, weighing 9lbs. Dr Ronnie Laing might well have linked his unusual birth (only 3% of babies at term present bottom first) with his unconventional career path. He was evacuated at the beginning of the second world war, and this experience was emotionally traumatic for him. Secondary school at Dame Alice Owen's, Islington, was followed by medical training at the London hospital medical college, where he qualified with honours in surgery, and obstetrics and gynaecology in 1953. Tuberculosis, which he developed as a medical student, was treated successfully in a Swiss sanatorium, where he learnt German and met the woman who became his first wife. Huntingford lectured at Charing Cross hospital from 1958-61, then became senior lecturer and honorary consultant at St Thomas's hospital. He worked in the new field of perinatal medicine and helped to develop foetal monitoring. In 1965, he was appointed to St Mary's hospital, Paddington - at the age of 36, the youngest professor in his speciality - and was assistant editor of what is now the British Journal Of Obstetrics And Gynaecology. He was a founder member of several influential bodies, such as the Blair Bell Research Society in 1962 (where he was active as an officer until 1971), the Anglo-German Medical Society in 1961, and the European Society of Perinatal Medicine in 1968. From 1965-71, he was secretary to the Medical Research Council working party on the prevention of rhesus iso-immunisation during pregnancy, an initiative which has almost eliminated perinatal deaths from this cause. He published more than 70 scientific papers during this period, as well as contributing to medical textbooks and making tape-slide programmes for teaching medical students. This brilliant and productive academic career led to Huntingford being asked by the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (Spuc) to allow his name to be used on its letterhead. Spuc was formed after the passage of the 1967 Abortion Act to fight against its provisions, and Peter, as one who had done research designed to improve foetal survival and wellbeing, was seen as a natural ally. Huntingford, however, was an obstetrician and gynaecologist who listened to women, and he came to believe that they should make their own decisions about their bodies. He was fortunate in having as his senior lecturer at St Mary's, David Paintin, who had worked in Aberdeen with Dugald Baird, and was a quiet advocate of a woman's right to choose. Peter became an outspoken and high-profile supporter of the pro-choice movement. This capacity to change his mind endeared him to his friends, but also made him enemies. In 1970, he left his chair to work for the World Health Organisation as adviser in maternal and child health in south-east Asia. By then, his first marriage had ended in divorce and he had married his second wife, Diane. Returning to Britain in 1974, he was appointed, as professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, to head the joint academic department of the London hospital and St Bartholemew's hospital medical colleges. He took this post on the understanding that he was not going to do research, but apply the knowledge that he had gained to provide a good service for women. Huntingford set up the Tower Hamlets day-care abortion service in 1977, and worked with GPs to encourage them to take part in maternity care. He started a domino scheme in which the GPs and midwives looked after women delivered in hospital and transferred them home after six hours. He supported home births - which was not then the policy of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. He advised the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the Family Planning Association, and chaired the Pregnancy Advisory Service, then one of the two non-national health service abortion providers. He gave evidence to the Lane Commission on the working of the Abortion Act, and was unstinting in his support for women to have a choice about whether or not they had a baby, and how they gave birth. Huntingford moved from the main teaching hospital at Whitechapel to the greener and less pressured Mile End hospital. There, he was able to provide the kind of service that women wanted - and he wanted for them. His attitude to student teaching was far ahead of the time; he sat with the students, and they wrote the aims and objectives of their course (this was before I was appointed as senior lecturer, in 1977, and helped to provide a structured course). Peter felt that the attitude of the doctor - and thus of the medical student - was of crucial importance in look ing after women; he was teaching this 20 years before the General Medical Council published Good Medical Practice and Tomorrow's Doctors, with their emphasis on good communication and partnership with patients. In 1981, he resigned his chair and took up an NHS consultant post in Maidstone, in a unit without registrars, where he worked until he retired, aged 60. His dedication to his patients was exemplified by his walking the seven miles to work during the 1987 storm, when the roads were impassable. Peter realised the potential of mass media to get his message across, and was an accomplished performer. In 1984-85, he presented the influential television programme, Birth Right: The Parent's Choice. In retirement, he did medico-legal work, applying his brilliant mind as an expert for the plaintiff, helping women who had suffered adverse surgical and obstetric outcomes. Huntingford will be re membered with gratitude and affection by thousands of women whose complaints he listened to with attention, and by those he cared for in pregnancy. Those whom he taught, both as medical and midwifery students, and those who listened to him lecture, will remember his extensive knowledge, and logical, yet caring, approach. His contribution to the changed climate in maternity care - with its emphasis on women's choice, which led to the 1993 Cumberlege report - is incalculable. Despite his academic achievements, Peter never became a member of the establishment. Sadly, his last decade was spent living alone in relative obscurity, his marriage and life destroyed by alcoholism. He is survived by Diane, and his children, Paul and Zoe. \u0095 Peter John Huntingford, obstetrician and gynaecologist, born June 1 1929; died October 13 2000",

The Next Steps, highlights failings in policy and suggests alterations that could be accommodated in the next budget, or in the maternity rights review expected by the end of next month.</p> <p>It argues that 1.4m \"economically inactive\" women would like to get back to work but are unable to do so because, due to their partner working or gaining benefit on their behalf, they are ineligible for the new deal schemes.</p> <p>The working families tax credit, while helping lone parents, also discourages mothers with working partners to return to work, leading many women to a lifetime of low individual incomes.</p> <p>The state second pension, while including a number of \"women friendly features\", is not offered to women who earn less than \u00a361 a week - affecting up to one in six women.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown was yesterday urged to do more for women as a report warned they were \"falling through the gaps\" in a tax and benefit system that was based on an outdated view of the nuclear family. Harriet Harman MP called on the government to treat the report by the Fawcett Society \"very seriously indeed\" ahead of the chancellor's pre-budget report, expected a week tomorrow. \"There is no doubt the system Labour inherited was based on outdated assumptions about men being the breadwinner and women looking after the children - assumptions which are long out of date,\" said the former social security secretary. \"It is going to be a major task to modernise it. The government has done a lot but there is a great deal more to be done.\" The report, Delivering for Women? The Next Steps, highlights failings in policy and suggests alterations that could be accommodated in the next budget, or in the maternity rights review expected by the end of next month. It argues that 1.4m \"economically inactive\" women would like to get back to work but are unable to do so because, due to their partner working or gaining benefit on their behalf, they are ineligible for the new deal schemes. The working families tax credit, while helping lone parents, also discourages mothers with working partners to return to work, leading many women to a lifetime of low individual incomes. The state second pension, while including a number of \"women friendly features\", is not offered to women who earn less than \u00a361 a week - affecting up to one in six women. Also, the pension, based on the male pattern of working for 49 years continuously, penalises women, with even those with a full basic state pension and state second pension receiving less than the minimum income guarantee within five years of retirement. Rectifying many of these problems would be relatively simple, according to Mary-Ann Stephenson, the director of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality. The disincentives to second earners in the working family tax credit could be removed, she said, and the pensions system (already controversial) could be altered; the rules governing the new deal for the long term unemployed, which require a person to be registered unemployed for a year before being eligible for retraining, could also be loosened. The report was described as \"absolutely essential\" by Ruth Kelly, Labour MP for Bolton West, who has pushed for better rights for women by campaigning for parental paid leave. And she suggested that, with an election looming, the chancellor would be wise to take account of it. \"It highlights some very significant and helpful points Labour has to address - and womens' votes are crucial to winning the next election.\" The Treasury said last night: \"As the [Fawcett Society] author herself points out, the government has made a commitment to delivering for women and has introduced several policies which have improved women's lives, along with other measures such as the record increase in child benefit.\"",

As PA to the director and assistant director at the west London-based Royal Ballet School, Keen has found herself with far more on her hands than taking letters and opening the post. </p> <p>Since starting her job in September this year, Keen, 34, has been dealing with camera crews in the school corridors and journalists on the phone - all searching for an insight into the life of a dancer. \"The film has been great at exploding the myth about dance just being something for boys from a specific background,\" she says. \"We have 75 students here in the upper school; almost half are boys and they are from all backgrounds.\" </p> <p>As she points out, ballet is not for the weak. \"I would like to find a footballer who could lift a seven stone dancer with one hand and hold her up there in front of two thousand people.\" When she is not dealing with the press, Keen finds herself with a mixture of the usual, and more unusual, PA duties, such as getting the tutus dyed or entertaining international dancers. Both her bosses (director Gailene Stock and assistant director Jay Jolley) were \"star dancers\" before moving into education. \"We really work together as a team here,\" says Keen. \"They are both great at doing their own emails and correspondence and their time management is wonderful.\" </p> <p>But what about the legendary \"artistic temperament\"? Are we talking temper tantrums before coffee? Keen is quick to defend. \"They are both really good humoured,\" she insists. \"We have a committed, dynamic and creative energy in the school that you wouldn't see in the corporate world.\" The school has a long and rich history. It started as the Sadler's Wells School in 1947 and the boys department came a year later in 1948. It wasn't until October 1956 that the school became known as the Royal Ballet School. </p> <p>Since then the school has trained leading dancers such as Darcey Bussell, now a school governor, and Jonathan Cope, a dancer with the Royal Ballet. Picking through Keen's CV, it is plain to see that her move to the Royal Ballet School was a perfectly logical step. She spent time in a local dance school but realised quite quickly that she did not have the required flexibility to progress in dance and turned her sights to music. With an indecent number of grades in flute and piano to her name, she later took a music and dance degree at Birmingham University. </p> <p>After graduating, she enrolled on a secretarial course to make herself marketable. One area she had no problems with was the keyboard. \"Having trained as a pianist, the keyboard came naturally to me and I am a very fast typist,\" she says. After three years working in arts administration in Sydney, she spent seven years at the Royal Academy of Dancing, as PA to the chief executive and later as registrar for the Royal Academy's BA course. </p> <p>Before moving to the Royal Ballet school she notched up two and a half years at College of Art and Design as PA to the dean and head of college. \"At that time I really wanted to learn about education in a broader sense,\" she explains. But the temptation of the Royal Ballet School was not to be passed over. \"I have always wanted to work in the ballet world and give back something I gained in childhood,\" she says. </p> <p>Despite the artistic setting, her job does have the more mundane correspondence, diary and travel arrangement duties. But there's also the exceptional: \"We have gala performances that we hold in the summer at the Royal Opera House and this year I'll be helping organise the Young British Dancer of the Year.\" The big project which is riding alongside the day-to-day running of the school is the proposed relocation to Covent Garden, to a building which will cost \u00a315m to construct and is due to be finished by 2002. Needless to say, Keen is involved in the fundraising. </p> <p>Even so, she still finds time to get out and about. \"The students have performance opportunities in Swan Lake and The Nutcracker and they get to go to the rehearsals so it's great when the invitation is extended to the staff.\" She may also find herself visiting dance venues, sorting out seating plans or picking up a visa. </p> <p>But what she really appreciates about her job is something that is fed into her office every day. \"One of the wonderful aspects is the music and the sound of the piano playing. I go home with the repertoires singing in my ears.\"</p>",

So this week, instead of forcing such tiresome workmates into headlocks and locking them in a toilet cubicle until they calm down, be aware that they might well be suffering from stress. Best point them in the direction of a website. It will be more tolerant than you of their griping. WPM, of course, manages to spare her colleagues the excesses of her moaning by relieving herself of all her stresses and grievances through this column. As she's sure you're aware. </p> <p>* Bosses who think that there's no problems with stress in their firm should be aware that their employees are consummate liars. When questioned by mental health charity Mind about absences from work caused by stress, 27% of workers admitted that they would rather fabricate a purely physical reason for taking time off than tell their boss that they were suffering from stress. However, as 61% of people now cite stress in the workplace as the number one cause of mental illness, maybe it's unsurprising that the afflicted would rather confess to a hangover than to feeling under pressure. </p> <p>* Secretaries are often charged with making business travel arrangements for bosses who can't figure out for themselves how to get from London to Frankfurt. They are also often blamed if tickets go astray, planes are cancelled, hotels are double-booked or they forget to request a room with an executive trouser press or the correct fluffiness of the complimentary bathrobe. </p> <p>What can you do? Well, not much really. But you can stop your boss from being arrested or killed by not sending him or her to global danger-spots, which is bound to earn you brownie points back in the office (with the boss, if not the rest of the staff). <a href=\"http://www.hrworldclass.com\">www.hrworldclass.com</a> launched in the summer, and the site has now added a survival manual (the full monty will, however, cost you; details online) with advice on how to avoid some of the world's less pleasant stop-overs.

      "body": "<p>John Prescott has called for a second summit meeting with rail boss Gerald Corbett, Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the shadow strategic rail authority and the rail regulator, government sources confirmed last night.</p> <p>As the emergency repair blitz continued to wreak havoc across the rail network, concern about Railtrack's management of the crisis was understood to be increasing among ministers.</p> <p>Ministerial sources said yesterday the company had been given a last chance to prove it could put its own house in order and was now facing a race against time to provide clear indications that the national situation was improving.</p> <p>It is understood the deputy prime minister, who has refused to give his backing to Railtrack's chief executive, will demand a full report on the progress of the national recovery plan when he meets Mr Corbett on Thursday.</p> <p>There was also speculation among industry insiders last night that Railtrack could risk having its licence revoked if it failed to deliver significant changes.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the rail regulator said: \"It would be possible for us to recommend this to the secretary of state but the decision would have to be his own. He is the only person who has the power to revoke the licence.\"</p> <p>She added: \"It is not something we are thinking of at the moment.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, as fears about the safety of the rail network rose, Railtrack launched an investigation into claims that an internal memo issued by a sub-contractor ordered workers not to cut out faulty sections of track because they were \"not practical or cost effective\" to fix.</p> <p>The memo, leaked to the News of the World, allegedly shows GT Maintenance - which looks after 20,000 miles of track - was aware of crucial defects in the network and told safety managers to take out serious faults \"only if they have the resources to do so\".</p> <p>Railtrack said it was concerned about the allegations highlighted in the letter and had immediately launched an investigation.</p> <p>The company also confirmed that the urgent track inspections triggered by the Hatfield crash, which claimed four lives on October 17, were expected to be finished by midnight tomorrow.</p> <p>Mr Corbett visited the crash site last night. He said: \"It [the work] has severely affected passengers for which we truly apologise. It has been a dreadful week for passengers but they can rest assured that the railway is safe.

      "bodyText": "John Prescott has called for a second summit meeting with rail boss Gerald Corbett, Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the shadow strategic rail authority and the rail regulator, government sources confirmed last night. As the emergency repair blitz continued to wreak havoc across the rail network, concern about Railtrack's management of the crisis was understood to be increasing among ministers. Ministerial sources said yesterday the company had been given a last chance to prove it could put its own house in order and was now facing a race against time to provide clear indications that the national situation was improving. It is understood the deputy prime minister, who has refused to give his backing to Railtrack's chief executive, will demand a full report on the progress of the national recovery plan when he meets Mr Corbett on Thursday. There was also speculation among industry insiders last night that Railtrack could risk having its licence revoked if it failed to deliver significant changes. A spokeswoman for the rail regulator said: \"It would be possible for us to recommend this to the secretary of state but the decision would have to be his own. He is the only person who has the power to revoke the licence.\" She added: \"It is not something we are thinking of at the moment.\" Meanwhile, as fears about the safety of the rail network rose, Railtrack launched an investigation into claims that an internal memo issued by a sub-contractor ordered workers not to cut out faulty sections of track because they were \"not practical or cost effective\" to fix. The memo, leaked to the News of the World, allegedly shows GT Maintenance - which looks after 20,000 miles of track - was aware of crucial defects in the network and told safety managers to take out serious faults \"only if they have the resources to do so\". Railtrack said it was concerned about the allegations highlighted in the letter and had immediately launched an investigation. The company also confirmed that the urgent track inspections triggered by the Hatfield crash, which claimed four lives on October 17, were expected to be finished by midnight tomorrow. Mr Corbett visited the crash site last night. He said: \"It [the work] has severely affected passengers for which we truly apologise. It has been a dreadful week for passengers but they can rest assured that the railway is safe. This weekend I think we've turned the corner.\" Passengers endured a weekend of disruption and delays as more than 20,000 people worked around the clock to investigate the incidence of \"gauge corner cracking\" and lay almost 25 miles of rail at 160 sites across the country. Anthony Smith, national director of the Rail Passengers Council, said last night: \"Every region has been affected, with some worse than others. \"Scotland and the north are less disrupted while the east coast mainline, Clapham Junction, South Wales and the Bristol area are terribly snarled up.\" Further travel chaos was expected today as the biggest work programme on the railways for more than 100 years continued. Mr Smith said: \"The original predictions of it being over by Wednesday now appear optimistic and it's going to carry on for 10 days, two weeks, or longer.\" One train company advised passengers to avoid using trains altogether as the crisis reached its peak yesterday. Kevin Johnson, spokesman for Midland Mainline, which operates between London and Sheffield via the east Midlands, said yesterday: \"It has been bad during the week and we have been told the disruption is going to last for at least two weeks, but today I would suggest people do not travel at all.\" A Railtrack spokeswoman said the situation would become much clearer by Wednesday when the track inspections were completed: \"The future depends on what we find when we have completed our inspections. We will have identified the sites where there is a need for track to be replaced and we will then have an idea of the scale of the job,\" she said. She confirmed the network would be \"stabilised\" by today, when 10% to 15% of speed restrictions would be lifted and an emergency timetable brought into force. She added delays were inevitable. \"Obviously there will still be speed restrictions in place. It is going to be one or two months before this is all over.\" Meanwhile it emerged that the lack of highly skilled engineers in Britain has forced some firms to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in an overseas drive to gain much-needed expertise from other countries. Glasgow-based firm First Engineering, which is contracted to carry out engineering work on behalf of Railtrack, yesterday confirmed that it had hired 14 engineers from Romania to help rebuild Britain's crisis-hit rail network. The engineers, who have all studied for six years at university in their home country, will begin work on signalling systems across the rail network. The are expected to start in Scotland and north-west England next year.",

Due to a genetic mistake they occasionally make rogue antibodies that attack healthy tissue. The antibodies can trigger the production of copies of themselves, which the UCL team says leads to a huge self-sustained attack on joints and tissue.</p> <p>\"It probably takes just one genetic mistake in a lifetime to trigger this reaction but once it gets going it becomes a vicious circle,\" said Prof Edwards.</p> <p>\"Unlike with other cells in the immune system, most people can live without any B-cells for a while. By the time we reach adulthood we have already made most of the antibodies we need.\"</p> <p>After one treatment to wipe out all the B-cells the body responds by making fresh ones. According to Prof Edwards, the chances of new B-cells making the same mistake and thereby triggering a return of rheumatoid arthritis was very small.</p> <p>Anthony Clarke, medical director of the Royal National hospital for rheumatic diseases in Bath, was enthusiastic. \"In broad terms the idea that you could safely take out of the inflammatory process those cells that are driving it without affecting others is very attractive. Rheumatoid arthritis is a very unpleasant condition, [and] up until now we have only been able to treat the symptoms or keep it off the boil with drugs that can have very unpleasant side effects, so this is potentially very exciting.\"</p> <p>Dr Clarke warned that it could be two or three years before the drug was generally available. \"There is no point in anyone going to their doctor tomorrow morning,\" he said. \"It needs to be tested on a far larger group to make sure it can be used safely and without side effects. Those are the sort of things that have to be looked at carefully before it can be licensed.\"</p> <p>Mr Gutch called on the government to make funds available if it did prove successful. \"Two of the issues now will be: is it very expensive and will the drug budgets be increased so the treatment can be prescribed? We would argue it would be a good investment - enabling people to stay at work and not be on social security, as well as relieving the terrible pain and suffering.\"</p> <p>Prof Edwards believes the therapy could help other auto-immune diseases, from multiple sclerosis to Crohn's disease. \"If our explanation is right, auto-immune diseases could be like bugs in a computer programme. The solution is to turn everything off and start up afresh.\"</p> <p><b>The victims of joint disorder</b></p> <p>\u0095 More than 3 m people in the UK are significantly disabled by rheumatic diseases.</p> <p>\u0095 One child in every thousand has arthritis.

The antibodies can trigger the production of copies of themselves, which the UCL team says leads to a huge self-sustained attack on joints and tissue. \"It probably takes just one genetic mistake in a lifetime to trigger this reaction but once it gets going it becomes a vicious circle,\" said Prof Edwards. \"Unlike with other cells in the immune system, most people can live without any B-cells for a while. By the time we reach adulthood we have already made most of the antibodies we need.\" After one treatment to wipe out all the B-cells the body responds by making fresh ones. According to Prof Edwards, the chances of new B-cells making the same mistake and thereby triggering a return of rheumatoid arthritis was very small. Anthony Clarke, medical director of the Royal National hospital for rheumatic diseases in Bath, was enthusiastic. \"In broad terms the idea that you could safely take out of the inflammatory process those cells that are driving it without affecting others is very attractive. Rheumatoid arthritis is a very unpleasant condition, [and] up until now we have only been able to treat the symptoms or keep it off the boil with drugs that can have very unpleasant side effects, so this is potentially very exciting.\" Dr Clarke warned that it could be two or three years before the drug was generally available. \"There is no point in anyone going to their doctor tomorrow morning,\" he said. \"It needs to be tested on a far larger group to make sure it can be used safely and without side effects. Those are the sort of things that have to be looked at carefully before it can be licensed.\" Mr Gutch called on the government to make funds available if it did prove successful. \"Two of the issues now will be: is it very expensive and will the drug budgets be increased so the treatment can be prescribed? We would argue it would be a good investment - enabling people to stay at work and not be on social security, as well as relieving the terrible pain and suffering.\" Prof Edwards believes the therapy could help other auto-immune diseases, from multiple sclerosis to Crohn's disease. \"If our explanation is right, auto-immune diseases could be like bugs in a computer programme. The solution is to turn everything off and start up afresh.\" The victims of joint disorder \u0095 More than 3 m people in the UK are significantly disabled by rheumatic diseases. \u0095 One child in every thousand has arthritis. Around 20% of all visits to the doctor are arthritis related. \u0095 Rheumatoid arthritis, which affects more than 750,000 people, is a common inflammatory disease of the joints. \u0095 It is the one rheumatic disease most associated with severe physical handicap and is three times more common among females than males. \u0095 There is currently no cure although treatments can help reduce the symptoms, but often with unpleasant side effects. \u0095 Surgery, physiotherapy and occupational therapy can also help damaged joints work better. \u0095 Rheumatoid arthritis costs the taxpayer more than \u00a31.3bn a year in treatments, care and disability benefits.",

In turn, that broke down barriers and improved staff morale.\" </p> <p>Words are the tools of a law firm's trade, explains the spokesperson. \"So trying to think about other, more spiritual, areas, where words are equally important, seemed the per fect way in which to enhance our working environment.\" </p> <p>Rob Briner, an organisational psychologist who specialises in the link between work and well-being, agrees: \"It is finally being recognised that we need to appeal to employees' hearts and souls as well as to their minds and pockets.\" </p> <p>Indeed, workers in the UK may be among the most highly paid in the developed world, but they are also among the most unhappy, according to a recent survey. \"A mere 36% of British employees enjoy their work, with only Hungary and Japan more unhappy still,\" says Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at the University of Warwick, who conducted the survey alongside David Blanchflower from Dartmouth College in the US. </p> <p>\"There are far too many damaged people in workplaces up and down this country,\" agrees Father Dermot Tredget, a Benedictine monk from Douia Abbey, who campaigned for spirituality at work at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) conference last week. \"They have suffered through overwork, failing to balance work and home, failing to develop their emotional intelligence and being the victims of a 24-hour work-orientated culture. No wonder they're starting to insist, 'We're here to make a life, not just a living.'\" </p> <p>So stressed out have workers in the City of London become that they are flocking to the Reverend Peter Delany, vicar of All Hallows, close to the Tower of London. \"I get commodities brokers, traders, dealers and their support staff increasingly approaching me to heal the rift between work and the spirit - even if it's just during lunchtimes,\" he says, adding that it isn't necessarily a religious experience. \"Many of the people who come have never been to church in their lives. They're just after someone in the business of seeking deeper meaning to life.\" </p> <p>As a result of the growing interest, the local business community has helped the churches in that area to fund a stress clinic. \"It offers a range of holistic therapies such as chiropractic, dietary and osteopathic advice. These can work hand in hand with the spiritual chats employees have with the vicars,\" explains Reverend Delany. </p> <p>Mori, which has carried out research on \"spirituality as a phenomenon\", recently found that, along with reports of stress among the British workforce, there is also quite simply a growing sense of wanting more from the work experience. \"It seems to come from the recent focus on business ethics, environmental concern, socio-economic values and a rejection of hard-nosed capitalism,\" says Susan Walker, the managing director of human resources research at Mori. </p> <p>Professor Oswald adds that job insecurity is prevalent in the UK. \"In fact, a lot of people, particularly support staff, who feel this insecurity are unhappy, not because they constantly get laid off but because they constantly leave jobs of their own free will. The fear of insecurity, it appears, can leave workers feeling out of control, and they try to win it back by moving on before there's a chance that they can be asked to move on. The problem is that this is a vicious circle, causing them inevitable unhappiness as well as a failure to find any purpose in their working lives.\" </p> <p>Briner believes the trend towards employee assistance programmes and emotional intelligence has encouraged an office culture in which emotions are no longer taboo. \"Mention spirituality in the work place 10 years ago and there's a good chance you'd have got nothing but a snigger. Mention it today, and there's a good chance you'll get people who are genuinely interested.\" </p> <p>Indeed, in Bristol, the Reverend Harold Clarke, who leads the Council for Industry and Social Responsibility, has a range of business people approaching him on a variety of issues. \"A colleague is chaplain to Economic Life in Swindon, where two or three 'women in business' groups meet regularly,\" he adds. </p> <p>The 90s emphasis on teamwork is also responsible for the search for the spiritual, believes Briner. In fact, he says, improving collective working is one of the chief areas where employers - rather than just employees - can gain from spirituality at work, whatever form it takes. The theory is that understanding the role the spiritual dimension can play in our lives will help build better relationships at work and thus enable people to work more effectively. </p> <p>Father Tredget agrees. \"A spiritually-friendly workplace will be more than just a nice place to work. It will also be more profitable. Such workplaces will have greater staff retention rates, so lowering recruitment costs; see an increase in creativity and innovation; see improved morale, co-operation and teamwork and will see an improvement of the interface between the organisation and its customer-base.\" </p> <p>Relationships out of work can also be improved, he says. After all, research shows that the single biggest wedge between millennial couples is caused by work. \"People want to make sense of where work should fit into their lives, and have the chance to put their families first.\" </p> <p>Father Tredget predicts that \"understanding the spiritual will become such an important part of workplace human development that it will begin to regularly feature in management training, and will eventually have a place in some form or another in every organisation, no matter how small.\" </p> <p>So is it goodbye to traditional interviews, where you're asked to reveal your word processing skills, and hello to theatre and painting workshops where you'll be asked to reveal your \"inner child\"? Maybe not yet. But don't be surprised if your flexible benefits package starts to include the options of personal gurus and a lifelong subscription to a feng shui magazine.</p>",

Office feuds can be experienced in even the friendliest of environments. But what to do when faced with one? </p> <p>Whether you are involved directly or an innocent bystander watching others curdle the workplace atmosphere, Jane Clarke, author of Office Politics (published by the Industrial Society) offers some sound advice. \"On the whole, people do not like dealing with conflict, but it is very important to grab the bull by the horns. If you feel you are able to, you should try and sort it out.

Reasons can be as diverse as a clash of personalities, jealousy, backstabbing, or a simple misunderstanding. Whatever the cause, there has to be a strong desire to solve the problem if things are to get better. If you are personally involved - and almost all of us have been in one way or another - then the best thing to do, says Clarke, is to try to put yourself in the other person's shoes. Easier said than done, since empathy is not an easy emotion to come by, even to the most virtuous. </p> <p>\"Often it is easy to dump on the other person and blame them totally for the situation, but remember it is your problem and you have a responsibility to try to resolve it,\" says Clarke. </p> <p>Listening skills are vital. If the problem is between other colleagues, things can be a bit trickier. You may not be the gallant sort - practising an unhealthy dose of denial is often what most people would prefer to do - but ignoring the situation will not make it go away. </p> <p>So what are your options? \"If you feel you are up to it, try talking with the feuding parties individually and try to understand what the issue is,\" advises Clarke. \"Make it clear that you are a neutral party and that it is not an acceptable state of affairs.\" </p> <p>Mediation is another option; get the two parties to sit together and act as a buffer zone. You might have the urge to bash their heads together, but it won't be terribly constructive. As Clarke says, \"Sometimes it is a case of translating. People are often so different that it seems that they speak a different language.\" </p> <p>Any meetings between disputing colleagues should have some follow-up. All involved should be made aware of the next steps - failing to do this could mean that the situation repeats itself. </p> <p>Negative energy between people need not produce bad karma. Harnessed creatively, it can actually become a positive force. So, if you are having problems with the office dullard who will insist on putting a downer on any bright new ideas you might have, use their criticism and objections as a way of really testing a brainwave. Surely, if it can survive them, it can survive anyone. Try looking at people's weaknesses as strengths: assign a pedant to research the finer details of a project; the loudmouth of the office can always be pushed forward when it comes to public speaking. </p> <p>Disputes and ill feelings can arise both among employees or between employee and employer, a fact clearly illustrated by the record numbers of people who contacted conciliation service Acas over the past year: 715,000, according to figures released last week. Acas officials were called in to help resolve almost 1,500 industrial disputes, another huge increase.

The Royal Ballet were often accused of neglecting Tudor (who pre-dated Kenneth MacMillan in his passionately psychological approach to character). But they did eventually commission two works from him, Knight Errant (1968, for the touring company) and Shadowplay, which was created in 1967 and is now being revived after a lapse of 17 years. </p> <p>The date of this odd but interesting ballet might suggest intimations of flower power. After all, it is set in the Indian jungle where a young man - the Boy with Matted Hair - encounters various characters who guide him towards some final state of grace. Dominant among these is a male figure, Terrestrial, and a seductive goddess, Celestial. As the Boy dances with them they seem to be fighting for possession of his body, mind and heart. </p> <p>Tudor was, however, no hippie. The work's provenance is Kipling as well as Buddhism (its score, Les Bandar-Log by Charles Koechlin, is based on the Jungle Book), and the story is given substance by the detailed imagination of Tudor's craft. The chorus of \"monkeys\" who swarm across the stage move with a raucous, ragged agility that's far from cute (you can imagine Tudor taking notes at the zoo), and the two central figures possess an amoral power that undercuts any suggestion of sentimentality in their roles. </p> <p>The Terrestrial (Nigel Burley) pitches his force against the Boy in duets of grappling emotional and physical heft - but, when he crouches over the Boy like his spiritual shadow, an arresting core of stillness emerges. Celestial is even more interesting in the predatoriness that overlays her erotic intent; at certain moments she is like a bird of prey or a dangerous insect, crawling on to the Boy's kneeling body and curving down her arms for the kill. Tamara Rojo is extraordinary in this role, her tiny body ravenous for sensation, her eyes locked into the Boy's with hypnotic suggestion. Carlos Acosta as the Boy lacks a basic fluidity of style but more than compensates with a concentrated stage presence that carries the ballet from start to finish. </p> <p>If Tudor's Shadowplay embodies the confident eccentricity of a mature artist, Michael Corder's new ballet, Dance Variations, seems the work of a man playing desperately safe. Set to Richard Rodney Bennett's deft but unmemorable score, Corder's choreography puts its dancers through their classroom paces expertly, but without ever surprising us or them. The problem is that both movement and score emphasise each other's shallowness: as the music modulates from perky to solemn so, automatically, does the dance, but neither interest us in the reasons why.

At ground level, the new Wessex Water Operations Centre is almost invisible, tucked into a tumbling landscape that offers misty views over the Limpley Stoke valley to distant Cley Hill and Salisbury Plain. </p> <p>The amazing thing is that virtually everyone in the building has access to these views, for this big office block, home to Wessex Water's 520 staff, is about as transparent as such a building can be. A lightweight building boasting high, coffered ceilings, big windows that actually open, and three tiers of open-plan offices sheltering two imaginatively landscaped courtyards, it is awash with daylight. </p> <p>By night, the building all but vanishes: architect and client wanted to keep night lighting levels as low as possible, so that the stars will continue to shine here. </p> <p>A concern for low-energy design and construction, artworks and landscaping has informed the building at every stage of its development. This is possibly the most energy-efficient company headquarters in Europe. Yet it is not some worthy, over-polite design, but a handsome, convincing modern building that manages to combine elements of the best new university buildings and air terminals. If you're going to spend much of your life in an office, it ought to be as good as this. </p> <p>The architects are Bennetts Associates, the engineers Buro Happold. The landscaping is by Bernard Ede/Grant Associates, the contractor Mace. Jonathon Porritt advised on ecological issues. The person who speaks for the management is Colin Skellett, chairman and chief executive of Wessex Water Services, a man who can proudly proclaim: \"I'm a water and sewage man, have been since I was 16.\" </p> <p>\"We want to work with the landscape and our natural resources as naturally, sensitively and efficiently as we can,\" Skellett says. \"And we want the staff to enjoy working here.\" </p> <p>Skellett attended a weekly 7.30am meeting with his architects. He saw the building through to completion and says there is nothing about it that he would change now that it is finished. He ought to be proud of it. For here is a building designed from the inside out that connects intimately to the landscape it lies so low in. Its lavatories are flushed by rainwater drained from its stainless steel and meadow grass roofs. </p> <p>The building runs broadly east to west, which reduces overheating from the sun on fine days and makes the most of the prevailing winds. In 2000 it is almost a privilege to walk through and work in a building without air conditioning or any other forms of health-threatening and dispiriting mechanical ventilation. Here is a building with relatively low levels of lighting: neither electric lights nor low winter sun dazzle. </p> <p>\"Perhaps it will be a little hotter on some days in summer,\" says Ian Taylor of Bennetts Associates, \"and a little cooler in winter than office workers have come to expect, but we're talking of a building in which staff have quite a degree of control over their environment and in which the total energy cost is about a third of that of a conventional office building.\" </p> <p>Similar concerns made themselves felt during construction. Old railway sleepers, for example, made up 40% of the rough aggregate used in making the concrete needed for part of the building. The idea was to cut down on the energy used in making concrete; this was further reduced by having the concrete roof vaults - good for thermal insulation - held up by a lightweight stainless steel frame. </p> <p>\"Throughout,\" says Taylor, \"we've tried to keep out any form of mechanical or electrical service that is either wasteful of energy or likely to go wrong. The building is sophisticated yet pretty innocent from a technological and ecological viewpoint.\" </p> <p>From the staff's point of view, too, the building has a transparency and serenity absent from most office buildings. Each of the three office wings connects seamlessly with an internal street where the library, meeting rooms and cafeteria are located. </p> <p>The manager of the secure 24-hour control centre and incident room is explaining how his box of computers works when he is distracted by a hawk hovering outside the windows. \"We see deer here in the morning,\" he says. This is a man used to working in windowless rooms and underground bunkers. Now he and his colleagues have some of the best views of all. </p> <p>\"It has made a difference already in terms of staff motivation,\" says Skellett. \"Since we've moved in, absenteeism has fallen - not that it was a problem. We offer a free bus service to staff that runs to Bath city centre; we expected a bit of mass emigration at lunchtime, but it hasn't happened. It's a lovely place to be.\" </p> <p>And it will be lovelier still come spring, when the gardens laced with meadow will become a romantic tapestry of wild English flowers, the pond will be alive with newts and dragonflies, and the gardens will be in full bloom. The idea is that staff can work outside in the courtyards and gardens on sunny days, eat their lunch outside or just sunbathe. </p> <p>This welcoming place is a million miles from the kind of local authority office of 20 or 30 years ago. The Wessex Water team positively welcomes visitors: there is an education room for schoolchildren and, when the gardens are in bloom, it would make a nice afternoon out on the free bus from Bath station. Perhaps the staff won't really want hordes of curious visitors trampling around their workplace, but when the architects have been encouraged to design the equivalent of a latter-day Oxbridge College with gardens to match, they might just have to get used to the idea.</p>",

Here is a building with relatively low levels of lighting: neither electric lights nor low winter sun dazzle. \"Perhaps it will be a little hotter on some days in summer,\" says Ian Taylor of Bennetts Associates, \"and a little cooler in winter than office workers have come to expect, but we're talking of a building in which staff have quite a degree of control over their environment and in which the total energy cost is about a third of that of a conventional office building.\" Similar concerns made themselves felt during construction. Old railway sleepers, for example, made up 40% of the rough aggregate used in making the concrete needed for part of the building. The idea was to cut down on the energy used in making concrete; this was further reduced by having the concrete roof vaults - good for thermal insulation - held up by a lightweight stainless steel frame. \"Throughout,\" says Taylor, \"we've tried to keep out any form of mechanical or electrical service that is either wasteful of energy or likely to go wrong. The building is sophisticated yet pretty innocent from a technological and ecological viewpoint.\" From the staff's point of view, too, the building has a transparency and serenity absent from most office buildings. Each of the three office wings connects seamlessly with an internal street where the library, meeting rooms and cafeteria are located. The manager of the secure 24-hour control centre and incident room is explaining how his box of computers works when he is distracted by a hawk hovering outside the windows. \"We see deer here in the morning,\" he says. This is a man used to working in windowless rooms and underground bunkers. Now he and his colleagues have some of the best views of all. \"It has made a difference already in terms of staff motivation,\" says Skellett. \"Since we've moved in, absenteeism has fallen - not that it was a problem. We offer a free bus service to staff that runs to Bath city centre; we expected a bit of mass emigration at lunchtime, but it hasn't happened. It's a lovely place to be.\" And it will be lovelier still come spring, when the gardens laced with meadow will become a romantic tapestry of wild English flowers, the pond will be alive with newts and dragonflies, and the gardens will be in full bloom. The idea is that staff can work outside in the courtyards and gardens on sunny days, eat their lunch outside or just sunbathe. This welcoming place is a million miles from the kind of local authority office of 20 or 30 years ago. The Wessex Water team positively welcomes visitors: there is an education room for schoolchildren and, when the gardens are in bloom, it would make a nice afternoon out on the free bus from Bath station. Perhaps the staff won't really want hordes of curious visitors trampling around their workplace, but when the architects have been encouraged to design the equivalent of a latter-day Oxbridge College with gardens to match, they might just have to get used to the idea.",
