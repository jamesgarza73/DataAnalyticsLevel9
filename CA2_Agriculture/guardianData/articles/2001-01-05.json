      "bodyText": "An extraordinary vendetta by the daughter of a dead terrorist leader lies behind the dramatic public apology of Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, last night for his part in a violent assault on a policeman during a protest in the 1970s. Leading opposition politicians are demanding that the charismatic Green party chief step down. Mr Fischer said he wanted to make \"an apology for the wrongdoing to others\" he had perpetrated in his streetfighting days when he was a young leftwing militant. Photos published by Stern magazine and the tabloid daily Bild Zeitung showed him apparently luring a riot policeman into a violent ambush. The pictures were supplied to the papers by Bettina R\u00f6hl, whose mother was the terrorist leader Ulrike Meinhof. In a message posted on her personal website yesterday, Ms R\u00f6hl said she intended to follow up the publication of the photographs with the release of additional, allegedly compromising, material. The street clash \"will become sort of uncomfortable for its hero when I soon publish the Super 8 movie and other material which comes with it and which is complementary to the photos\", she said. Her message, written in lengthy, winding sentences, was shot through with bitterness towards Mr Fischer, whom she accused of trying to cover up his past on the far left. The foreign minister's record is soon to come under closer scrutiny than ever before. He has been summoned to give evidence later this month at the trial on terrorist charges of a former friend, Hans Joachim Klein. Ms R\u00f6hl claimed yesterday that he was one of the other attackers shown in the photographs. Mr Klein is accused of taking part in the mass kidnapping of Opec oil ministers in Vienna. in 1975. Stern said the photographs of the demonstration were taken in 1973 - two years earlier. Ms R\u00f6hl discovered the pictures while researching a book to be published later this year. The conservative daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said last night that they had been taken by a staff photographer and had lain in the paper's archives for 28 years. Ms R\u00f6hl's mother, one of two leaders of the infamous Baader-Meinhof Gang, committed suicide in prison in 1976. Mr Fischer, on the other hand, renounced violence and moved gradually into the political mainstream. Three years ago, he was named foreign minister after the Greens struck a coalition deal with Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats. Though outside Germany he has recently became a hate figure for the right, because of his espousal of a federal Europe, inside Germany Mr Fischer is just as much of a hate figure for the left, who accuse him of betraying his radical principles. In 1999, after he sided with Nato's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, Mr Fischer suffered a burst eardrum when an enraged fellow-Green hurled a paint bomb at him. His role in radical far-left politics and among squatters in Frankfurt, where he was a student, has long been known. But he had rarely spoken in detail about it before talking to Stern's interviewers. \"We squatted houses and when they were supposed to be cleared we defended ourselves,\" he said. \"We threw stones. We were beaten up but we also fought back strongly.\" He added: \"Yes, I was militant. But I always rejected the armed struggle and fought it politically\".",

      "body": "<p> Another week, another year, another new experience - on Saturday, the troubles over, I took the bus to Pokhara. Not wishing to repeat previous bus journeys, I opted for the 'posh' bus. It was worth every rupee.</p> <p>I am afraid I took an instant dislike to Pokhora. It was like Yarmouth sea front with better views. Admittedly, there was a two-day festival to celebrate the king's birthday and new year, so it was busier than usual. The little bands of local musicians and dancers were delightful, but the bars and shops blasting out pop music non-stop put me off. I had the worst meal yet, the local dal bhat with inedible meat. My soap bag fell into the toilet; luckily I had a spare airline toothbrush. The internet was slow and seven times the price of Kathmandu. Am I going to end up judging this trip by the standard of the email services?</p> <p>Sunday started better as I had breakfast in a lovely spot at the lakeside. At midday until the evening an incredible thing happened: it rained - the first rain I have seen for a month. I used the time to organise (through the hotel) a two-day trekking trip. It was to be a taxi for about 10 kilometres, four or five hours walking, a night in the mountains and the walk to Sarenkot (which has stunning views for miles all round) and then walk down again and get a taxi back. It all sounded managable, and I was promised a good guide. </p> <p>That evening I went to another Nepalese dance show. I only really went so that I could say I had been to the Fish Tail Lodge, a hotel on the lake that you are ferried to on a raft. Sorry Don, $100 a night is out of my league, but $3 for the show was OK. The audience this time were seven Nepalese young men and me. I kept my camera firmly zipped in my bag after last time. Never trust your camera to an American, they fiddle with buttons. Neither Alan, the American, nor I had a clue that he had taken a movie and I sent it off to the Guardian thinking it was a still. Imagine my shock when I visited the website. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/movies/travel/yeti.mpg\">Watch the movie</a>] Oh well, just add it to the manic photos. </p> <p>I have never been to bed at 10pm on New Year's Eve before, not that I got much sleep as the music went on until 3am and then all the motorbikes started up. By seven the next morning I was up and ready for my trek. However, bad news awaited me: there was another two-day strike across the whole of Nepal - so no taxi! Also, my guide had been partying all night and so had decided to join the strike as well. Either I had to make do or lose half the money I had already paid. I decided to go for it.</p> <p>My new guide was recruited from the hotel staff. A young lad, five foot tall with a huge woolly hat pulled over half his face appeared. I was assured he was 17 and had done lots of trekking. He hastily stuffed a jacket into a bag and off we went, walking to the spot our taxi should have taken us. By 11 o'clock my hips, knees and feet were aching and we had only reached the place where we should have started. We walked across the whole valley, about 20km, and finally stopped for lunch at 1.30pm. Here a woman cooked the inevitable dal bhat (I opted for vegetarian this time), tended to the baby and chased the chickens off the table all at once. Another half an hour of walking, and Rajis, my 'guide', who had limited English but was very sweet, said \"Now we go up here\", pointing to a huge hill, the top of which I couldn't make out. </p> <p>For three hours we climbed up rock steps. I was hurting quite badly by now, and somewhere on the way up strained a groin muscle. There were lots of rests. Bruce was tired too and had to have a lie down about halfway up. Every turn I hoped to see the top but it was just more steps. Things were not helped by a Nepalese man, who walked with us for a little way saying \"English put their old people in homes. Do you live in one?\" If I had had the energy, I would have pushed him over the edge. Finally, at 5pm, we reached the top and the lodge at Dhampus. </p> <p>I fell on to one of the three beds and could not move for an hour, until I started to freeze. Hot tea and a meal that I didn't have much appetite for helped a bit. The nicest part was joining the lodge's Nepalese family in their kitchen to sit by the fire. There were five boisterous children and a mad puppy, all happily helping with the chores, dancing and amusing the baby. Gran arrived, did a little dance and went away again. Rajis then told me he was sharing a room with me. Although I had a sleeping bag, we both collected a heavy solid quilty thing (Carol called these radiation blankets), collapsed fully dressed and unwashed - there was only an outside tap and you can imagine the temperature - and were asleep by 7pm. I woke about midnight, sweating and feeling very unwell. The quilt was discarded and I did manage to get back to sleep. </p> <p>Miraculously, I felt OK in the morning. Maybe it was the 12 hours sleep or the magnificent view of the mountains at dawn from the veranda. They were stunning, with sparkling sunlight and only wispy clouds. A sight I will never forget, and impossible to capture on film. We joined up with four Korean students from the next lodge. They had a proper guide, who took my little fledgling Rajis under his wing. It was easier walking with others, even if they could speak hardly any English. I took comfort that one girl was struggling even more than I was. A joke developed that I was Rajis' mother and all day he would ask 'Mommie OK?' and 'Mommie tired, I carry mommie's bag?' I took up the offer on the up bits, which I was finding very difficult. A couple of hours and we were down the other side of the hill and the going was reasonably level, until suddenly another monster hill appeared in our way. My heart and legs sank. </p> <p>Fortuitously, an enterprising local offered us a ride to the top by road for 100 rupees each. I willed the Koreans to agree, which thankfully they did. Cheating? I don't care. It was great, and there was a delicious omelette and Tibetan bread at the top. Then another four-hour slog. The Koreans shared their snacks of chewy dried fish (yuck) and strips of seaweed (yummy). By 2pm we reached Sarenkot, 1592m up, with panoramic views of Pokhara and the lakes, 700m below, and the hills and mountains behind. Lunch and then two hours or so of climbing down stone steps into the valley. </p> <p>By now we were all seriously suffering. One of the Korean's knee gave out, my groin muscle screamed in protest, and I developed a huge blister about halfway down. And this was supposed to be recreation? Even Rajis was exhausted, but he insisted on carrying my bag. Only the real guide was OK, but he had his hands full helping two of the girls.</p> <p>By the time we reached the bottom I would have given the digital camera, my own camera, my new kinetic Seiko watch, even all of them together, for a taxi back. Instead we trudged the last miles back into Pokhara and the hotel. I didn't have the energy to point out to the proprietor that he hadn't had to pay for taxis and a guide and had therefore made a huge profit, not to mention the fact that he had nearly killed me in the process. It was a couple of hours before I could move enough to have a blissful hot shower and change into clean clothes. </p> <p>Do I regret my trek?... long pause... No.</p> <p>Would I do it again? NO. </p> <p>On Wednesday, I was up at six in the morning to catch the bus back to Kathmandu. All the dal bhat and chicken shit finally caught up with me and I hastily swallowed an Immodium, praying it would work its magic before the six-hour bus journey. God bless the wonders of modern medicine! Breakfast and lunch were included in the ticket but I could not eat a thing. The mere sight of the dal bhat we were given for lunch turned my stomach. So, sore all over and feeling awful I was back in Kathmandu. It almost felt like home. I am now in the Holy Lodge and it is the best room I have had since the tour. It even has carpet and proper woolly blankets. I am only doing things that require no leg movement - it's Friday and I can still hardly walk.

      "bodyText": "Another week, another year, another new experience - on Saturday, the troubles over, I took the bus to Pokhara. Not wishing to repeat previous bus journeys, I opted for the 'posh' bus. It was worth every rupee. I am afraid I took an instant dislike to Pokhora. It was like Yarmouth sea front with better views. Admittedly, there was a two-day festival to celebrate the king's birthday and new year, so it was busier than usual. The little bands of local musicians and dancers were delightful, but the bars and shops blasting out pop music non-stop put me off. I had the worst meal yet, the local dal bhat with inedible meat. My soap bag fell into the toilet; luckily I had a spare airline toothbrush. The internet was slow and seven times the price of Kathmandu. Am I going to end up judging this trip by the standard of the email services? Sunday started better as I had breakfast in a lovely spot at the lakeside. At midday until the evening an incredible thing happened: it rained - the first rain I have seen for a month. I used the time to organise (through the hotel) a two-day trekking trip. It was to be a taxi for about 10 kilometres, four or five hours walking, a night in the mountains and the walk to Sarenkot (which has stunning views for miles all round) and then walk down again and get a taxi back. It all sounded managable, and I was promised a good guide. That evening I went to another Nepalese dance show. I only really went so that I could say I had been to the Fish Tail Lodge, a hotel on the lake that you are ferried to on a raft. Sorry Don, $100 a night is out of my league, but $3 for the show was OK. The audience this time were seven Nepalese young men and me. I kept my camera firmly zipped in my bag after last time. Never trust your camera to an American, they fiddle with buttons. Neither Alan, the American, nor I had a clue that he had taken a movie and I sent it off to the Guardian thinking it was a still. Imagine my shock when I visited the website. [Watch the movie] Oh well, just add it to the manic photos. I have never been to bed at 10pm on New Year's Eve before, not that I got much sleep as the music went on until 3am and then all the motorbikes started up. By seven the next morning I was up and ready for my trek. However, bad news awaited me: there was another two-day strike across the whole of Nepal - so no taxi! Also, my guide had been partying all night and so had decided to join the strike as well. Either I had to make do or lose half the money I had already paid. I decided to go for it. My new guide was recruited from the hotel staff. A young lad, five foot tall with a huge woolly hat pulled over half his face appeared. I was assured he was 17 and had done lots of trekking. He hastily stuffed a jacket into a bag and off we went, walking to the spot our taxi should have taken us. By 11 o'clock my hips, knees and feet were aching and we had only reached the place where we should have started. We walked across the whole valley, about 20km, and finally stopped for lunch at 1.30pm. Here a woman cooked the inevitable dal bhat (I opted for vegetarian this time), tended to the baby and chased the chickens off the table all at once. Another half an hour of walking, and Rajis, my 'guide', who had limited English but was very sweet, said \"Now we go up here\", pointing to a huge hill, the top of which I couldn't make out. For three hours we climbed up rock steps. I was hurting quite badly by now, and somewhere on the way up strained a groin muscle. There were lots of rests. Bruce was tired too and had to have a lie down about halfway up. Every turn I hoped to see the top but it was just more steps. Things were not helped by a Nepalese man, who walked with us for a little way saying \"English put their old people in homes. Do you live in one?\" If I had had the energy, I would have pushed him over the edge. Finally, at 5pm, we reached the top and the lodge at Dhampus. I fell on to one of the three beds and could not move for an hour, until I started to freeze. Hot tea and a meal that I didn't have much appetite for helped a bit. The nicest part was joining the lodge's Nepalese family in their kitchen to sit by the fire. There were five boisterous children and a mad puppy, all happily helping with the chores, dancing and amusing the baby. Gran arrived, did a little dance and went away again. Rajis then told me he was sharing a room with me. Although I had a sleeping bag, we both collected a heavy solid quilty thing (Carol called these radiation blankets), collapsed fully dressed and unwashed - there was only an outside tap and you can imagine the temperature - and were asleep by 7pm. I woke about midnight, sweating and feeling very unwell. The quilt was discarded and I did manage to get back to sleep. Miraculously, I felt OK in the morning. Maybe it was the 12 hours sleep or the magnificent view of the mountains at dawn from the veranda. They were stunning, with sparkling sunlight and only wispy clouds. A sight I will never forget, and impossible to capture on film. We joined up with four Korean students from the next lodge. They had a proper guide, who took my little fledgling Rajis under his wing. It was easier walking with others, even if they could speak hardly any English. I took comfort that one girl was struggling even more than I was. A joke developed that I was Rajis' mother and all day he would ask 'Mommie OK?' and 'Mommie tired, I carry mommie's bag?' I took up the offer on the up bits, which I was finding very difficult. A couple of hours and we were down the other side of the hill and the going was reasonably level, until suddenly another monster hill appeared in our way. My heart and legs sank. Fortuitously, an enterprising local offered us a ride to the top by road for 100 rupees each. I willed the Koreans to agree, which thankfully they did. Cheating? I don't care. It was great, and there was a delicious omelette and Tibetan bread at the top. Then another four-hour slog. The Koreans shared their snacks of chewy dried fish (yuck) and strips of seaweed (yummy). By 2pm we reached Sarenkot, 1592m up, with panoramic views of Pokhara and the lakes, 700m below, and the hills and mountains behind. Lunch and then two hours or so of climbing down stone steps into the valley. By now we were all seriously suffering. One of the Korean's knee gave out, my groin muscle screamed in protest, and I developed a huge blister about halfway down. And this was supposed to be recreation? Even Rajis was exhausted, but he insisted on carrying my bag. Only the real guide was OK, but he had his hands full helping two of the girls. By the time we reached the bottom I would have given the digital camera, my own camera, my new kinetic Seiko watch, even all of them together, for a taxi back. Instead we trudged the last miles back into Pokhara and the hotel. I didn't have the energy to point out to the proprietor that he hadn't had to pay for taxis and a guide and had therefore made a huge profit, not to mention the fact that he had nearly killed me in the process. It was a couple of hours before I could move enough to have a blissful hot shower and change into clean clothes. Do I regret my trek?... long pause... No. Would I do it again? NO. On Wednesday, I was up at six in the morning to catch the bus back to Kathmandu. All the dal bhat and chicken shit finally caught up with me and I hastily swallowed an Immodium, praying it would work its magic before the six-hour bus journey. God bless the wonders of modern medicine! Breakfast and lunch were included in the ticket but I could not eat a thing. The mere sight of the dal bhat we were given for lunch turned my stomach. So, sore all over and feeling awful I was back in Kathmandu. It almost felt like home. I am now in the Holy Lodge and it is the best room I have had since the tour. It even has carpet and proper woolly blankets. I am only doing things that require no leg movement - it's Friday and I can still hardly walk. I have even managed to work out how to put the emails into folders by country so that I can refer back to them as I go to each place. There is some great advice coming in about travelling around Malaysia - thanks. So on Monday it is back to Mumbai, and on Tuesday I'm off to Singapore. I have finally managed to contact my nephew who lives there. I do talk to people in cafes etc but it can get a bit lonesome at times. The emails from everyone really help.

At a meeting attended by NUJ and print union members at a venue outside Ludgate House, journalists discussed what they see as Ms Boycott's inability to improve redundancy terms for staff from Northern &amp; Shell. In particular, some journalists and managers believe the notorious email sent to owner Richard Desmond, which complained of his heavy-handed management, was inappropriate because it singled out some individuals whom he wanted to make redundant. In the email, which was leaked to the media, Ms Boycott castigated Mr Desmond after he outlined plans to get rid of two pregnant women and one long-term staff member who was disabled and had been promised a job for life under previous regimes. Although Ms Boycott was praised from some quarters for standing up for her staff, editorial sources say the people mentioned in the letter were not grateful for being singled out. Meanwhile, Northern &amp; Shell managers are in detailed discussions with unions about severance pay for staff in the sales, marketing and administration departments. Northern &amp; Shell is thought to have given ground on redundancy pay, and is now considering settlements of three weeks' pay for each year of service plus a month's full pay. The new offers are an improvement on the company's previous offer of a month's pay. Unions are also thought to have secured more voluntary redundancy terms.

The National Union of Teachers said it was considering \"protective action\" in areas with chronic staff shortages. Doug McAvoy, the NUT's general secretary, said schools should move to a four-day week rather than forcing teachers into the \"invidious position\" of having to cover classes for which they were not qualified. \"Where it is pushing hardest we are simply not going to be in a position of expecting schools to continue to cover up,\" he said. An Education Department spokesman said: \"Industrial action is not the way to tackle the immediate problem of teacher shortages.\" Official figures released yesterday showed applications for postgraduate teaching courses were down 2,289 - 16.1% - on this time last year, despite the offers of \u00a36,000 training salaries and \u00a34,000 \"golden hellos\" in shortage subjects. Applications to teach maths, a golden hello subject, have fallen by 29.8%. Applications for teaching French have dropped 21.8% and for teaching English by 16.7%, according to the graduate teacher training registry (GTTR). John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"These figures represent a worrying picture for the future of teacher recruitment and suggest that the crisis is likely to get much worse before it gets better.\" Secondary applications are down 14.6%, from 5,190 to 4,434, and primary applications have fallen from 8,857 to 7,376. John Bangs, the NUT's assistant general secretary, said: \"The government still has not recognised the depth of the crisis.\" Research for the union by Liverpool University academics Alan Smithers and Pamela Robinson suggested recruitment problems were not confined to the south-east. Although there were more vacancies in outer London and the south-east, secondary head teachers found it more difficult to recruit in the west midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, and Wales. Chris Waterman, general secretary of the Society of Education Officers, said that compared with other areas, London had more people on contracts but also a bigger pool of people on whom to call. \"London has a much less stable teaching force, but there is the flexibility to get people into teaching if the terms are good enough.\" Estelle Morris, the schools standards minister, will today offer 550 schools with poor exam results a share of a \u00a332m fund to help them retain staff. Some 281 schools will receive \u00a370,000 and 269 schools, which already get extra help from the excellence in cities or education action zone schemes, will receive \u00a320,000. Schools will be expected to spend the money on loyalty bonuses for teachers, particularly in shortage subjects, learning mentors to prevent truancy, or extra books. It could mean \"golden handcuffs\" of up to \u00a34,000 for some staff. Ms Morris will tell the north of England education conference in Bridlington that since 1997, 650 \"failing\" schools have come out of special measures. A \u00a37m advertising campaign by the Teacher Training Agency was launched last week, under the slogan, \"Those Who Can, Teach\".

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The latest edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians has been eight years in the making. You may think that sounds a long time to spend updating a reference work. But Grove is a big book. It is in 29 volumes, one of which is the index. It contains 29,499 entries. It weighs 68kg. Stand the volumes side by side and they measure 1.45 metres. It cost its publisher, Macmillan, \u00a320m to create. It is hard to overestimate the impact of Grove's publication on Monday, the first new edition for 20 years. It is a huge musical event. </p> <p>According to its editor, Stanley Sadie, who is now retiring after 30 years working on Grove, it is the largest single-subject reference work in the world. Anyone in the English-speaking world who is serious about music will have consulted it at some point or other. According to Sadie, the aim is that it should be a \"pleasurable read for someone who is interested in music as well as an efficient tool for the researcher\". If you want to check the precise meaning and history of an Italian tempo marking, you turn to Grove. If you want to read a concise biography of, say, the great violinist Jascha Heifetz, you turn to Grove. If you want to find a bibliography for more or less any western composer, then you turn to Grove. It claims to be \"the world's premier authority on all aspects of music\", though a more reasonable claim might be that it is the world's premier authority on western classical music from a British perspective. </p> <p>The Grove tradition stretches back to 1878, when the first part of George Grove's four-volume Dictionary of Music and Musicians was published. Grove was a Victorian polymath, an engineer who was friendly with Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Robert Stephenson and Charles Barry. He taught himself about music by listening to sung services in Westminster Abbey and by reading scores in the British Museum and copying them laboriously into a commonplace book. His dictionary was aimed at \"the intelligent enquirer\", who, \"in language he can understand\", would have the rudiments of music theory and history laid before them. It ran to five editions, the last published in 1954. </p> <p>\"It represented a very English way of looking at music, of the amateur music-lovers' tradition,\" says Sadie. \"Grove also said that he was not going to include music written before 1450 or what he called 'the music of barbarous nations'. What we did for the 1980 edition was to represent the music of all nations, periods and types - and make it fully professional.\" </p> <p>So how has Grove changed in the past 20 years? \"There is no dramatic shift,\" says Sadie, \"but we have had another 20 years of musical history to include and another 20 years' perspective on the early 20th century. In the 1980 edition we had 3,000 20th-century composers in the dictionary. Now we have 5,000.\" Among these new entries is a tranche of young British composers. One of these is Philip Cashian, who was written about by his friend and fellow composer, Michael Zev Gordon. \"It's hard to know where you stand in the world as a composer,\" says Cashian, \"so this stamp of approval is very welcome. I'm very honoured.\" Younger performers have also made their mark: Steven Isserlis, the cellist, has an entry, confirming his place as the top British cellist of his generation. \"It's nicer to be in than not,\" he says, \"though the article on me is a little out of date.\" </p> <p>Grove has further grown to fit current academic trends. A welcome boom area is the relationship between politics and music, which has given rise to, among others, a fascinating piece on nationalism. Gender and sexuality are also now up for discussion. The New Grove's Gay and Lesbian Music article contains the priceless declaration: \"Among affluent [gay] males the diva effect tends to produce a devotion to sopranos, Joan Sutherland or Maria Callas most notably ... and a subject position known as the Opera Queen.\" </p> <p>But the most significant change to Grove is that for the first time it will be available online. Those 29 volumes are reduced to words on a screen; that 68kg becomes blessedly weightless. In some ways, using Grove online makes you wonder how you ever survived it in book form. The possibilities for browsing the work are revolutionised. </p> <p>Grove online operates more like a search engine than a book. Instead of heading straight for an individual article you can type in a keyword and be directed all over the dictionary, and fast, without grappling with those endless, backbreaking hardbacks. Laura Macy, who has led the online team and will also take over from Sadie as overall editor, says that its Explore facility is as yet in its infancy; she wants to develop it so that you could click on a map and learn about music from a particular spot on the globe; or click on a timeline and find out what was going on in, say, May 1809. \"People's brains work differently in the ways they go after information,\" she says. \"We are trying to find more and more different ways into Grove.\" In the long term, sound should be a feature of Grove online too; at the moment readers will have to be satisfied with being directed to other sites for that. </p> <p>Perhaps the greatest advantage of Grove online, though, is that it is susceptible to continuous updating. Every quarter, factual errors will be corrected, death dates inserted and so on. This is fortunate, for even before Grove online is launched officially on Monday, Macy has received two in-trays' worth of corrections to attend to, mostly typographical errors and news of just-published books to be mentioned in bibliographies. Then, instead of there being a 20-year gap until the next full Grove, tranches of the dictionary will be overhauled annually. </p> <p>Grove will thus become not a book but a process, or, as Philip Cashian puts it, \"an organism\". You can't help feeling that all this puts the book well and truly in second place, though everyone involved in the dictionary seems to hesitate at the idea. Richard Charkin, Macmillan's chief executive, says: \"I very much doubt that the hard copy will ever become obsolete, but I would anticipate a gradual movement in scholarly circles from usage of the book to usage of the online version.\" Macy talks about the different uses of Grove. \"If you wanted to read the article on Wagner, you would probably find it easier to sit in a library with the book. Then you could turn to the online version for updates and links.\" </p> <p>This great beast will need taming lest it becomes a monster. Grove, even in its 29 volumes, is limited in size by physical realities. This limitation has its uses: it means that topics of more importance are given more space. This is a key part of what Sadie calls the \"historical and evaluative placing\" of entries in the dictionary. The online version, however, has an infinite capacity, meaning that Macy has a supreme challenge ahead of her - as she says, to \"maintain standards, and find ways of being current without being irresponsible\". She also has the opportunity to represent those areas that have been under-served by previous Groves. One area she mentions here is women in music. </p> <p>Already the organism is so vast that it contains some violent swings of tone. The ideal Grove style is sober, judicious, concise and clear. But it can also be wildly over-opinionated, even vituperative. The article on Kennedy, the violinist, is a case in point, referring to \"irreverent antics\" and \"self-indulgence\" and stating that \"many of his activities appear to have been geared to obtaining maximum publicity\". This is not reference-book talk. It is fighting talk. </p> <p>On the other end of the scale is the fact that a disturbing number of articles are fantastically dull. \"The words can fall like concrete off the page,\" sighs one contributor. \"It's almost as if they look for anything lively and then take it out. I think it comes from the academic idea that you must suffer in the pursuit of knowledge. I find Grove invaluable - but unreadable.\" Macy agrees that the dictionary can err on the side of the dry. \"I would like the writing to be more lively, to move away from formality,\" she says. \"I am a musicologist so I am allowed to say this: musicologists are not often very good writers. There is a wide world of prose between the unreadable and that which talks down to people.\" </p> <p>Still, Grove will always have its idiosyncrasies and quirks. David Fallows, the dictionary's early-music editor and a Guardian reviewer, also contributed the entry entitled Spoof Articles, citing two invented composers who appeared in the 1980 edition. (One of them, a certain Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup, was named after a railway line in the suburbs of Copenhagen.) \"It would have been easy for me to have dropped in a fictitious composer,\" he says, \"but I satisfied my libido on that point by constructing an acrostic in my piece on the composer Binchois. If you look at the first letter of every paragraph you'll see that they spell out the composer's name.\" It may sound a daft thing to do, but at least it is evidence of the human hand and voice. And surely there must be room for that, even in the most vast and poker-faced of reference books. </p> <p> <strong>Related articles:</strong></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,417761,00.html\"> But where's the music? </a><br> Alan Rusbridger ventures into the online version</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/friday_review/story/0,3605,417764,00.html\"> It's Bach - by a nose!</a><br> Nowhere in 1878, JS is now at the top.

      "bodyText": "The latest edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians has been eight years in the making. You may think that sounds a long time to spend updating a reference work. But Grove is a big book. It is in 29 volumes, one of which is the index. It contains 29,499 entries. It weighs 68kg. Stand the volumes side by side and they measure 1.45 metres. It cost its publisher, Macmillan, \u00a320m to create. It is hard to overestimate the impact of Grove's publication on Monday, the first new edition for 20 years. It is a huge musical event. According to its editor, Stanley Sadie, who is now retiring after 30 years working on Grove, it is the largest single-subject reference work in the world. Anyone in the English-speaking world who is serious about music will have consulted it at some point or other. According to Sadie, the aim is that it should be a \"pleasurable read for someone who is interested in music as well as an efficient tool for the researcher\". If you want to check the precise meaning and history of an Italian tempo marking, you turn to Grove. If you want to read a concise biography of, say, the great violinist Jascha Heifetz, you turn to Grove. If you want to find a bibliography for more or less any western composer, then you turn to Grove. It claims to be \"the world's premier authority on all aspects of music\", though a more reasonable claim might be that it is the world's premier authority on western classical music from a British perspective. The Grove tradition stretches back to 1878, when the first part of George Grove's four-volume Dictionary of Music and Musicians was published. Grove was a Victorian polymath, an engineer who was friendly with Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Robert Stephenson and Charles Barry. He taught himself about music by listening to sung services in Westminster Abbey and by reading scores in the British Museum and copying them laboriously into a commonplace book. His dictionary was aimed at \"the intelligent enquirer\", who, \"in language he can understand\", would have the rudiments of music theory and history laid before them. It ran to five editions, the last published in 1954. \"It represented a very English way of looking at music, of the amateur music-lovers' tradition,\" says Sadie. \"Grove also said that he was not going to include music written before 1450 or what he called 'the music of barbarous nations'. What we did for the 1980 edition was to represent the music of all nations, periods and types - and make it fully professional.\" So how has Grove changed in the past 20 years? \"There is no dramatic shift,\" says Sadie, \"but we have had another 20 years of musical history to include and another 20 years' perspective on the early 20th century. In the 1980 edition we had 3,000 20th-century composers in the dictionary. Now we have 5,000.\" Among these new entries is a tranche of young British composers. One of these is Philip Cashian, who was written about by his friend and fellow composer, Michael Zev Gordon. \"It's hard to know where you stand in the world as a composer,\" says Cashian, \"so this stamp of approval is very welcome. I'm very honoured.\" Younger performers have also made their mark: Steven Isserlis, the cellist, has an entry, confirming his place as the top British cellist of his generation. \"It's nicer to be in than not,\" he says, \"though the article on me is a little out of date.\" Grove has further grown to fit current academic trends. A welcome boom area is the relationship between politics and music, which has given rise to, among others, a fascinating piece on nationalism. Gender and sexuality are also now up for discussion. The New Grove's Gay and Lesbian Music article contains the priceless declaration: \"Among affluent [gay] males the diva effect tends to produce a devotion to sopranos, Joan Sutherland or Maria Callas most notably ... and a subject position known as the Opera Queen.\" But the most significant change to Grove is that for the first time it will be available online. Those 29 volumes are reduced to words on a screen; that 68kg becomes blessedly weightless. In some ways, using Grove online makes you wonder how you ever survived it in book form. The possibilities for browsing the work are revolutionised. Grove online operates more like a search engine than a book. Instead of heading straight for an individual article you can type in a keyword and be directed all over the dictionary, and fast, without grappling with those endless, backbreaking hardbacks. Laura Macy, who has led the online team and will also take over from Sadie as overall editor, says that its Explore facility is as yet in its infancy; she wants to develop it so that you could click on a map and learn about music from a particular spot on the globe; or click on a timeline and find out what was going on in, say, May 1809. \"People's brains work differently in the ways they go after information,\" she says. \"We are trying to find more and more different ways into Grove.\" In the long term, sound should be a feature of Grove online too; at the moment readers will have to be satisfied with being directed to other sites for that. Perhaps the greatest advantage of Grove online, though, is that it is susceptible to continuous updating. Every quarter, factual errors will be corrected, death dates inserted and so on. This is fortunate, for even before Grove online is launched officially on Monday, Macy has received two in-trays' worth of corrections to attend to, mostly typographical errors and news of just-published books to be mentioned in bibliographies. Then, instead of there being a 20-year gap until the next full Grove, tranches of the dictionary will be overhauled annually. Grove will thus become not a book but a process, or, as Philip Cashian puts it, \"an organism\". You can't help feeling that all this puts the book well and truly in second place, though everyone involved in the dictionary seems to hesitate at the idea. Richard Charkin, Macmillan's chief executive, says: \"I very much doubt that the hard copy will ever become obsolete, but I would anticipate a gradual movement in scholarly circles from usage of the book to usage of the online version.\" Macy talks about the different uses of Grove. \"If you wanted to read the article on Wagner, you would probably find it easier to sit in a library with the book. Then you could turn to the online version for updates and links.\" This great beast will need taming lest it becomes a monster. Grove, even in its 29 volumes, is limited in size by physical realities. This limitation has its uses: it means that topics of more importance are given more space. This is a key part of what Sadie calls the \"historical and evaluative placing\" of entries in the dictionary. The online version, however, has an infinite capacity, meaning that Macy has a supreme challenge ahead of her - as she says, to \"maintain standards, and find ways of being current without being irresponsible\". She also has the opportunity to represent those areas that have been under-served by previous Groves. One area she mentions here is women in music. Already the organism is so vast that it contains some violent swings of tone. The ideal Grove style is sober, judicious, concise and clear. But it can also be wildly over-opinionated, even vituperative. The article on Kennedy, the violinist, is a case in point, referring to \"irreverent antics\" and \"self-indulgence\" and stating that \"many of his activities appear to have been geared to obtaining maximum publicity\". This is not reference-book talk. It is fighting talk. On the other end of the scale is the fact that a disturbing number of articles are fantastically dull. \"The words can fall like concrete off the page,\" sighs one contributor. \"It's almost as if they look for anything lively and then take it out. I think it comes from the academic idea that you must suffer in the pursuit of knowledge. I find Grove invaluable - but unreadable.\" Macy agrees that the dictionary can err on the side of the dry. \"I would like the writing to be more lively, to move away from formality,\" she says. \"I am a musicologist so I am allowed to say this: musicologists are not often very good writers. There is a wide world of prose between the unreadable and that which talks down to people.\" Still, Grove will always have its idiosyncrasies and quirks. David Fallows, the dictionary's early-music editor and a Guardian reviewer, also contributed the entry entitled Spoof Articles, citing two invented composers who appeared in the 1980 edition. (One of them, a certain Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup, was named after a railway line in the suburbs of Copenhagen.) \"It would have been easy for me to have dropped in a fictitious composer,\" he says, \"but I satisfied my libido on that point by constructing an acrostic in my piece on the composer Binchois. If you look at the first letter of every paragraph you'll see that they spell out the composer's name.\" It may sound a daft thing to do, but at least it is evidence of the human hand and voice. And surely there must be room for that, even in the most vast and poker-faced of reference books. Related articles: But where's the music?

      "body": "<p><strong>DEAL TIME</strong></p> <p>It's been another crazy day in the crazy transfer world of Arry Redknapp, perhaps the most fiendish wheeler-dealer outside the planet Fiend. No players were bought. No players were sold. But didn't East End Arry have a bubble bath (ie: laugh) trying! First off, he decided that Manchester City's \u00a33.7m offer for Steve Lomas was \"very reasonable\" and accepted it on the spot - even though a tearful Lomas yesterday told him: \"I'm settled here and have never asked for a transfer. I am more than happy to be at West Ham and proud to play for them.\"</p> <p>So at 11.11am, Lomas was off to talk to City. Or at least he was until 11.12am, when Arry accepted a bid from Everton as well. But by 3pm, Arry had decided Lomas was staying put, saying without a hint of irony: \"I had a chat with Steve and I really want to keep him here.\" And that wasn't all, because Redknapp then revealed that while he'd given up trying to sign Gareth Southgate - \"I don't think I'm going to get anywhere near getting Gareth. \u00a310m is not feasible for us. He's a good player but it's a lot of money for a 30-year-old\" - he still had his eye on Rangers' accident-prone defender Lorenzo Amoruso. </p> <p>\"The deal is on with Rangers - it's just whether Amoruso fancies it and we can do a deal with him,\" Arry chirped, before whistling breezily that he \"wouldn't have a clue what he's looking for in personal terms until we sit down and have a chat with him\". However, Teamtalk tell a different story. They say that West Ham have offered Amoruso a signing-on fee of \u00a3750,000 plus \u00a320,000-a-week. Sadly, Amoruso wants a \u00a32m signing on fee plus \u00a325,000-a-week - a figure that East End Arry is baulking at. Even so, he remains confident that someone will be turning up soon. \"I think Monday or Tuesday next week I'll get a player or two in,\" said Arry, who is beginning to make Barry Fry sound tight.</p> <p><strong>FOWLER TIME</strong></p> <p>Tick tock ... tick tock ... tick tock ... do you like our fancy watch? Yes, it is rather special isn't it? We suppose you're wondering why the face is cracked with bits falling off it. Well, that's because it's the Fiver's patented Robbie Fowler Inevitable Transfer Countdown Timepiece. It doesn't work quite as well as it used to, but it's still does a basic job. Mind you, the hands are guaranteed to start turning like the clappers whenever someone interviews Gerard Houllier about the recent unprovoked attack on Fowler, or Chelsea's renewed \u00a314m interest in the striker in the wake of Jari Litmanen's arrival at Anfield ... whirl ... whirl ... whirl ... listen, the Liverpool manager must be talking to someone!</p> <p>\"It was not the best time to be where he was, and he will acknowledge that\" ... spin ... spin ... spin ... \"To be honest maybe it wasn't the best thing to be where he was at that time but we have to remember that it was a very nasty, unprovoked attack which is very sad in modern society\" ... wheech ... wheech ... wheech ... \"It could have happened to any of our players, it could have happened to me, and we must really avoid that sort of incident in the future\" ... revolve ... revolve ... revolve ...</p> <p>\"I don't know what [Chelsea] will do now\" ... turn ... turn ... turn ... \"It was a coincidence that Jari has arrived when this has unfortunate incident has happened to Robbie.

What we want is to keep the four strikers\" ... swirl ... swirl ... bbrrrrrraaannnngggggggggggg! Ah, there goes the alarm. We give it until the end of the season, then.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"The guy had actually said that he had lots of pain in his groin and guts because I kicked him there, which was unbelievable to hear. I got him on the left side of his bottom, but I hardly touched him to be honest. If I wanted to kick him he would still be lying there. It seems incredible that the police were not there to protect the game and the players from these crazy streakers - and then they come to question me!\" - Igor Stimac shudders while remembering West Ham's trip to Walsall in the Worthington Cup last September. The streaker ended up with a \u00a350 fine, while the charges against Stimac were dropped.</p> <p><strong>SOL WHINE</strong></p> <p>\"I'm happy, I'm willing and I'm here to do business!\" These may sound like the words of a drunk, dandruff-ridden executive stumbling around an \"exclusive\" Amsterdam \"club\" with tenners sticking from the flap in his Y-fronts. But they're not. In fact, they belong to one the most loyal footballers in the Premiership: namely, Sol \"Spurs isn't my middle name, 'Spurs is my middle name' is my middle name\" Campbell.</p> <p>All poor Sol wants to do is sign a contract with Spurs. But, cruelly, he is unable to fulfil his dream because he isn't being offered enough cash to do so. \"It hurts. In a way I am not selfish in that I want the club to do well rather than worrying about a contract and money,\" his totally non-contradictory explanation began. \"It means so much to me to do well for Tottenham, rather than go somewhere else. I'm happy here but there's a lot of things to sort out off the field.\"</p> <p>Luckily for everyone concerned, Sol is a generous sort. \"Some clubs have their own reasons to be like that but for me I love the game of football and I just want to keep on playing football for Tottenham,\" he dreamed, before getting down to brass tacks. \"I have put my cards down and now they have to make their move.\" The Fiver, for one, hopes Spurs do the right thing by the poor lad. After all, how will he feel if he is forced to sign a much more lucrative deal with Manchester United? Or Arsenal? Or Fulham?

Mind you, the hands are guaranteed to start turning like the clappers whenever someone interviews Gerard Houllier about the recent unprovoked attack on Fowler, or Chelsea's renewed \u00a314m interest in the striker in the wake of Jari Litmanen's arrival at Anfield ... whirl ... whirl ... whirl ... listen, the Liverpool manager must be talking to someone! \"It was not the best time to be where he was, and he will acknowledge that\" ... spin ... spin ... spin ... \"To be honest maybe it wasn't the best thing to be where he was at that time but we have to remember that it was a very nasty, unprovoked attack which is very sad in modern society\" ... wheech ... wheech ... wheech ... \"It could have happened to any of our players, it could have happened to me, and we must really avoid that sort of incident in the future\" ... revolve ... revolve ... revolve ... \"I don't know what [Chelsea] will do now\" ... turn ... turn ... turn ... \"It was a coincidence that Jari has arrived when this has unfortunate incident has happened to Robbie. You don't prepare a transfer overnight!\" ... hurtle ... hurtle ... hurtle ... \"I have always said I want four strikers and I won't change my mind. What we want is to keep the four strikers\" ... swirl ... swirl ... bbrrrrrraaannnngggggggggggg! Ah, there goes the alarm. We give it until the end of the season, then. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"The guy had actually said that he had lots of pain in his groin and guts because I kicked him there, which was unbelievable to hear. I got him on the left side of his bottom, but I hardly touched him to be honest. If I wanted to kick him he would still be lying there. It seems incredible that the police were not there to protect the game and the players from these crazy streakers - and then they come to question me!\" - Igor Stimac shudders while remembering West Ham's trip to Walsall in the Worthington Cup last September. The streaker ended up with a \u00a350 fine, while the charges against Stimac were dropped. SOL WHINE \"I'm happy, I'm willing and I'm here to do business!\" These may sound like the words of a drunk, dandruff-ridden executive stumbling around an \"exclusive\" Amsterdam \"club\" with tenners sticking from the flap in his Y-fronts. But they're not. In fact, they belong to one the most loyal footballers in the Premiership: namely, Sol \"Spurs isn't my middle name, 'Spurs is my middle name' is my middle name\" Campbell. All poor Sol wants to do is sign a contract with Spurs. But, cruelly, he is unable to fulfil his dream because he isn't being offered enough cash to do so. \"It hurts. In a way I am not selfish in that I want the club to do well rather than worrying about a contract and money,\" his totally non-contradictory explanation began. \"It means so much to me to do well for Tottenham, rather than go somewhere else. I'm happy here but there's a lot of things to sort out off the field.\" Luckily for everyone concerned, Sol is a generous sort. \"Some clubs have their own reasons to be like that but for me I love the game of football and I just want to keep on playing football for Tottenham,\" he dreamed, before getting down to brass tacks. \"I have put my cards down and now they have to make their move.\" The Fiver, for one, hopes Spurs do the right thing by the poor lad. After all, how will he feel if he is forced to sign a much more lucrative deal with Manchester United? Or Arsenal? Or Fulham? We shudder to think. THE RUMOUR MILL Blackburn are hoping to sign Julian Maidena and Luis Enrique Rueda from Argentinian club Talleres, according to Planet Football. The battle for the signature of Italian midfield sensation Antonio Cassano is on. Manchester United have joined AC Milan, Juventus and Roma in a \u00a320m chase for the 18-year-old Bari player. NEWS IN BRIEF Corinthians midfielder Edu will leave for London today - with his valid passport - to complete a \u00a35.9m move to Arsenal. Aston Villa are confident that the signing of Juan Pablo Angel will go ahead, despite newspaper reports that Angel's agent Gustavo Muscardi is demanding \u00a3800,000 in commission. Villa spokesman Phil Mepham said: \"There is no hitch. Plans are in hand for him to come over here to complete his medical and formally complete the signing. There is no undue delay.\" Former Argentina manager Carlos Bilardo wants Diego Maradona to be his running mate when he bids for the Argentina presidency in 2003. \"Diego can do any job that is asked of him,\" he said. \"He knows people better than anyone else. If he says someone is a bad egg, you can be sure he is absolutely spot on. When Diego speaks you have to take notice and that's why I'd like to have him at my side as a politician.\" Alan Kelly has had a transfer request accepted by Blackburn. Morton have failed in an attempt to lure Ally McCoist on loan. Kilmarnock fear McCoist may be needed for their Scottish Cup tie at the end of the month. Elgin have been forced to postpone their Scottish Cup second-round tie against Queen of the South tomorrow because of a frozen pitch. The game will be played on January 13 instead. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: World Football (3.55am) \"In 1988 several friends and myself went to Channel 4 newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy's eighteenth birthday party,\" writes Marten Allen. Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (5pm) \"We went en masse to his Mum and Dad's house in Fence, near Burnley, arriving in a Land Rover that was running on fumes.\" Sky Sports 2: Cup Fever (7pm, 3am) \"We stopped the night and in the morning I siphoned off the petrol from Krishnan's dad's car to get us home, without their knowledge.\" Hold The Back Page (9pm) \"He never knew me that well and so from then on I was labelled a hooligan at the Murthy house.\" Radio Five Live: Sport on 5 with Ian Payne (7pm) \"I tell you what though, I went for a dump halfway through the party and the bog was a bloody disgrace.

In the real world, nobody has ever really seen two size six lesbians nuzzling up to each other in braces and men's trousers, as Armani showed on his runway this season. </p> <p>It's a long time since Diane Keaton popularised the \"little girl in search of a sugar daddy\" look in Annie Hall (big ties and oversized men's suits). In the 80s we saw Annie Lennox do it again in a harder form (suit plus slicked-back hair and lipstick) in the Sisters are Doing It for Themselves era, but it was Yves Saint Laurent who had put it on the map in 1968 when he dressed Catherine Deneuve in his famous tuxedo pant suit - although of course he accessorised it with lipstick and heels. </p> <p>A year ago, a dyke friend of mine was sent home from her job because she turned up in a suit and tie. \"You think you're some big dyke or something?\" her boss ranted.

When you interview a male fashion designer, he will tell you that: a) he is inspired by women who are strong (bless) and b) that clothes hang better on women with no breasts.

As a lesbian, I would say that breasts per se are aesthetically uninteresting. </p> <p>Traditionally, favoured designer labels include Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Ann Demeulemeester, Costume National, Yohji Yamamoto and, of course, Helmut Lang. These easy-to-wear, tailoring-based labels shout footloose-and-fancy-free (as opposed to Lacroix,Ungaro and Dior which shout round-the-clock armed guard and taxis). </p> <p>But there are many more looks to aspire to.

Fashion designers always say the important thing is to Be Yourself. Of course, this is rubbish. The important thing in fashion is to wear Gucci, dye your hair blonde and look like everyone else. Designers are constantly intrigued by the Big Lezza Look because Big Lezzas have chosen not to be like everybody else. They can't shake the feeling that there must be something fantastical lying at the back of our closet. \u0095 Biche by Stephanie Theobald is published by Flame (\u00a310.99).",

      "bodyText": "\"Everything points to the fact that a doctor with the sinister and macabre motivation of Harold Shipman is a once in a lifetime occurrence.\" Professor Liam Donaldson, chief medical officer Key findings \u0095 Shipman issued a total of 521 death certificates, 499 while he worked in Hyde. The highest number issued by any other Hyde practitioner in the audit was 210. \u0095 A comparison between Shipman and others shows that he issued 297 excess death certifcates. Of these, 236 patients died at home - the vast majority women over 65-years-old. \u0095 The excess death certificates were evident from the beginning of his practice in Hyde. Analysing the cremation forms The following trends were revealed among Shipman's deceased patients: \u0095 Death was more likely to occur in the afternoon \u0095 The cause of death was certified as heart conditions, stroke or old age \u0095 Mode of death described as syncope or collapse \u0095 Shipman was likely to be present at the death of his patients while relatives and carers often absent. The medical records \"Typically, Shipman records attending the patient within one day of death and finding vague symptoms or signs. In such circumstances, he frequently indicates a 'watch and wait' management plan by using the lettes 'tluk' - to let us know if the condition deteriorates. Case 502 is a typical example: (Day before death) 'h/o vertigo. Falls to 150/100 r leg ? weak ? plantar left all ok stemetil sachets tluk if alters.' (Day of death) 'o/e - dead.

British beef imports have been banned in Australia since 1996 but the government has now decided to suspend imports of all beef products from all 15 European Union nations. Australia's chief medical officer, Richard Smallwood, said the temporary suspension, which comes into force on Monday, was triggered by fears about links between BSE and variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD) in humans. Prof Smallwood said New Zealand will also ban EU beef. \"It is becoming clearer now that more countries in Europe may be affected by BSE in their cattle,\" he added. \"While the number of cattle involved in these countries is still small compared to the UK, federal health minister Dr Michael Wooldridge has taken action, in conjunction with other relevant ministers, to exclude these products from sale in Australia as a precaution. \"The risk to the health of Australians from the consumption of these products is extremely small. However, we need to keep one step ahead of the BSE/vCJD situation that is causing great concern in the UK and the rest of Europe.\" Retailers would be asked to introduce a voluntary withdrawal of the beef products specified in the ban, and consumers should throw away any cans of food that contained beef from a European country, Prof Smallwood said. Food already on its way to Australia and New Zealand would be stopped from entering shops. Imported beef and beef products from the countries specified in the ban accounts for just 0.2% of beef consumed annually in Australia, he said. A formal certification process is being established to assess future imports to ensure they are BSE-free. Australia and New Zealand had no BSE in their cattle, Prof Smallwood added. The import suspension affects 30 countries: Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia.

      "bodyText": "Labour last night astonished the political world and demoralised its opponents when it announced that two more multi-millionaires have each matched Lord Hamlyn's Christmas generosity and donated \u00a32m to the party's war chest. But the announcement that publisher and financier Christopher Ondaatje had joined Lord Sainsbury, now a government minister, in the \u00a32m club was not quite the act of public-spirited openness that Labour immediately claimed. After the enforced disclosure of Lord Hamlyn's similar gift, controversially filed six weeks before such donors will have to be identified by law, the Economist newspaper had warned Labour headquarters that it was poised to name the pair in today's edition. Mr Ondaatje told the Economist he had been approached by Labour in November and told of the other \u00a32m gifts. In December he agreed to donate the same. But only on Monday - as the Hamlyn row broke - was he asked to go public. All three donors are what one top fundraiser last night called \"men of impeccable standing in society\". All three have given far more than \u00a32m to cultural and educational bodies. The National Portrait Gallery's new wing in central London is named after Mr Ondaatje, the older brother of Michael Ondaatje, an award-winning novelist. The shift from dependency on the trade unions and party rank and file to the successful courtship of wealthy philanthropists is seen by MPs and party activists as representing a significant change in Britain's political culture. The cash will go into a general fund and Millbank described \u00a36m from three men as small beer compared with its \u00a325m annual budget. But it is nearly half what Labour will be allowed to spend at the coming election - a cap is expected to be set at around \u00a315m. Veteran Labour MP Tony Benn called it \"a negation of democracy\" while the Conservatives brazenly denounced \"Labour's continuing reliance on a small number of very large donors\" - precisely its own position for many years. The Liberal Democrats again called for state funding of politics to stop sleaze and prevent governments being \"in thrall to big corporations\". To rub salt into Conservative wounds, Mr Ondaatje was revealed as a former Tory donor who had become disillusioned with the party's anti-European stance. \"They [Labour] are doing a very good job [with the econ omy] at a difficult time and I believe they should be given every possible support,\" Mr Ondaatje said. A Conservative victory at the election would be a disaster, he added. Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, has already donated millions to Labour and before that to the SDP, which was also backed for a period by Lord Hamlyn. Last night Lord Sainsbury said he was announcing his latest gift of \u00a32m to head off speculation. \"In our democ racy, political parties have to raise funds to campaign and put their policies to the electorate, and as a proud supporter of the Labour party I am happy that I am in a position where I can make a contribution,\" he said. Last night Labour spin doctors insisted that the party retained the broadest fundraising base in Britain with 40% of its income coming from party members and small donors (below \u00a35,000), 30% from the unions, 10% from sales and merchandising and 20% from big donors. Lord Levy, the prime minister's personal fundraiser and envoy, is believed to have played a brokering role - although Chris Smith, the culture secretary, is admired by Mr Ondaatje and may have smoothed his path. Labour's spokesman, Lance Price, said: \"What we did feel after Lord Hamlyn made the statement he did on Tuesday, that it was right and proper, just to ensure that there was no confusion whatever, that other donors in that league, that we should at least contact them and see how they would feel about having their names made public as well.\" Andrew Lansley, a senior Tory MP, complained: \"This news of Labour's continuing reliance on a small number of very large donors, alongside the trade unions, for its financial backing highlights strongly the need for a broader base of party funding.\" A Labour backbencher, Andrew Mackinlay, last night called for all large donors to be barred from receiving peerages.

      "bodyText": "Serial killer GP Harold Shipman, convicted of murdering 15 patients, may have killed up to 297 during his 24-year career, according to a report published today. The Greater Manchester family doctor recorded 297 more deaths at his practice than other GPs working at a similar time in the same area. A statistical audit of his clinical practice between 1974 and 1998 found that he recorded 236 more deaths of patients in their homes than similar doctors. The excess of deaths was greatest among women over 75, suggesting the Hyde GP may be the UK's worst serial killer. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, ordered the clinical audit after Shipman was convicted in January last year of murdering 15 of his elderly women patients. Richard Baker of the University of Leicester carried out the audit, the results of which have been passed on to the police and crown prosecution service. The chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, said: \"The questions raised in the report will be distressing reading to the patients and relatives who were under Shipman's care over the years, but it is important for their sake that this work has been done and is published.

The new colour version, which features animated models without strings, pulled in 1.7 million viewers yesterday afternoon - one in five of those watching TV at the time. That was more than 400,000 up on the previous day's ratings for 3.45pm, according to unofficial overnights. When Children's BBC shows were last running in the afternoon on the channel, in the week before Christmas, that slot also averaged 1.3m. ITV kids' show Hey Arnold! took 1.4m and a 16% share while Bill and Ben was on air. Elsewhere yesterday, 15m - a whopping 60% of the available audience - watched Mark Fowler escape from the long arm of the law and from Nick Cotton in a cliffhanger episode of EastEnders. But once EastEnders was over, ratings tumbled to 7.6m with audience share halving. This was partly due to a rejuvenated Who Wants to be a Millionaire? with 12m tuning in to watch Mr and Mrs Hannaford have a domestic while trying to answer the \u00a3250,000 question. ITV comedy drama At Home with the Braithwaites returned successfully at 9pm with 7.6m, beating BBC1 opposition 2000 Acres of Sky, which was down to 6.2m. Exactly 1m viewers switched off the new BBC1 drama starring Michelle Collins and Paul Kaye as Londoners who have relocated to a remote Scottish island community. Channel 4's 1940s House began properly last night, following Tuesday's making-of taster, achieving a healthy 3.4m and 14% share from 9pm. Hairy people having sex may not sound much of a recipe for popular TV, but Channel 4 pulled off this unlikely feat last night with The Joy of Sex. The documentary about Dr Alex Comfort, the bearded wonder who became a sex guru in the 1970s after the publication of his Joy of Sex manual, drew 2.9m and a 15% share to Channel 4 from 10pm.",

But a little further west, in less fashionable Acton, is a modest terraced house which was the family home of 25-year-old Asma al-Akhras - until her marriage last Monday to the president of Syria. Miss Akhras, whose father is a heart specialist, was born in Britain to Syrian parents. She first met Bashar al-Assad in London, where - in the days when he had no expectations of becoming president - he studied ophthalmology. This is by no means an unusual story. The late King Hussein married a British woman, as have several sheikhs from the Gulf. The Arabs' love affair with Britain, and especially London, dates back to the time when large parts of the Middle East were British protectorates. Princes and wealthy sheikhs would send their sons to British public schools, and then to the military college at Sandhurst. That is still seen as a good preparation for government. King Abdullah of Jordan, the crown prince of Qatar and the son of Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Salih are among many who have followed the Sandhurst route.

Even today, although hospitals in the Middle East have improved greatly, some Arab politicians are still wary of local doctors who might be tempted to administer lethal doses of medicine or fail to wake them up after an operation. Because of their regular visits to Britain, wealthy Arabs began buying houses - which proved to be an excellent investment. This led them to look for other financial opportunities, and today Britain is regarded - especially in the Emirates - as one of the best places to invest. Horse racing, a passion among the wealthiest Arabs, is another reason for coming to Britain. One of King Hussein's bodyguards once recited to me the name of every British racecourse, plus the names of all the best gun shops in London. A couple of years ago, foreign secretary Robin Cook (himself a racing enthusiast) averted a crisis in Britain's relations with Dubai when Sheikh Mohammed al-Makhtoum complained about the state of racing in Britain. The sheikh, who owns about 400 horses, had threatened to boycott races in Britain unless the authorities who controlled the sport increased the prize money. (One curious but little known fact about the Makhtoums is that an officially recognised Scottish tartan bears their name, designed specially by a Pipe Major Stallard, and can be seen here.)

You can, if you wish, stroll up from Marble Arch (Marlboro Arch, as some Arabs call it), along the Edgware Road, wearing a dishdasha without looking out of place. You can eat Arab food, read Arabic newspapers, and generally feel at home. Equally, you can dress as a European, eat western food, and imagine that you're British. For the young, there's also the exciting prospect of meeting and talking to members of the opposite sex - something that many would be unable to do in their home countries.

A statistical audit of his clinical practice between 1974 and 1998 found that he recorded 236 more deaths of patients in their homes than similar doctors.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Geoffrey Rush spends the entire two and a bit hours of his new movie, Quills, locked in the cell of a lunatic asylum. This is perfect preparation for a day at the Dorchester, where he is incarcerated in an ornate room, given a constant supply of coffee by publicists, and asked to perform for the benefit of a group of cynical journalists. Luckily, Rush is so vivid that he survives both with aplomb: brilliant as the imprisoned Marquis de Sade (some critics have tipped him for a second Oscar), and in his hotel room appearing to offer up freshly-minted answers to questions he has probably already been asked six times that day. </p> <p>Quills, which is directed by Philip Kaufman, tells the story of the final years of Sade, condemned to the asylum of Charenton and forbidden to write, but smuggling out his incendiary texts with the help of a laundry girl, played by Kate Winslet. It is a costume drama that eschews historical fidelity in the interest of questions of universal significance - good v evil, freedom v censorship, the double-edged sword of creativity - and a broader audience. Thus Winslet as an early 19th-century French laundress, Michael Caine as an authoritarian doctor, and Joaquin Phoenix as the well-meaning priest who runs Charenton - none of them remotely believable, but perhaps that isn't the point. </p> <p>The critic Anthony Lane was suitably dismissive in the New Yorker, but spared Rush the executioner's blade. \"If you can stomach this stuff,\" he wrote, \"Quills should be seen simply for the presence of Geoffrey Rush. Of all the lies perpetrated by the film, his alone will win you over; in place of the Marquis de Sade, perhaps the most wearisome of revolutionary writers, we have a charming combination of scoundrel, flirt, dandy, nudist and wit.\" </p> <p>When Rush is on screen, the movie comes alive; when he isn't, it feels laboured and ludicrous. It is like one of those flabby novels with one terrific character, where you find yourself skipping pages in the hunt for his next appearance. It is a bravura performance - locked in that one room, remember - from an actor who, in the three years since he won the best actor Oscar for Shine, has become a superstar without losing his sanity and good sense. </p> <p>Rush is a valiant defender of the film, and obviously enjoyed working with the literary-minded Kaufman, director of The Right Stuff and The Unbearable Lightness of Being. \"You get offered something like this and you have to take the bait and rise to the occasion,\" says Rush, before launching into a fluent exposition of the historical background to the film. </p> <p>\"The period in which it is set is full of great extremes - a period in European history when the world was changing at an enormous rate, from an aristocratic, feudal structure into hopefully a democratic one. On one side of the coin, you have Rousseau saying man is a noble creature, give him the right nurturing and goodness will prevail. On the other, you have the marquis going, 'No, man is a nasty little depraved animal, take a look at yourself.'\" Rush is, as you may have gathered, an actor who both reads and thinks. </p> <p>\"I tried not to judge the marquis too much,\" he says. \"I was interested in the inner personality of the man as a writer, as a creative force who still has unavoidable connections and presence 200 years later. I wanted to assess the distance between the man and the writer, and the story takes you on that journey. He has a fear of intimacy and constructs a brilliant edifice around himself, but that is part of the sadistic personality and search for control. In playing him, I had to ask myself, 'Am I being too big, too crude? Am I using a machete when I should be using a scalpel?' But a machete can be pretty effective in the cinema.\" </p> <p>Rush, who is 49, is tall, rangy and fluid: even sitting down, all his limbs seem to be moving simultaneously. He chainsmokes and wears the battered outfit he perfected in the 20 years he spent on the Australian stage before Shine brought him to the attention of Hollywood. He comes across as a human being, and there can be no greater compliment for an actor, especially one enjoying - albeit relatively late - a meteoric film career. </p> <p>It is probably his stage work, past and present (he has no intention of letting it go), that has kept him sane. He has been attached to the Belvoir Street Theatre in Sydney since 1985, working principally with director Neil Armfield and achieving notable successes with Gogol, Chekhov, Jonson and Beaumarchais, exploring what Rush calls \"the grubby corners of the classical repertoire\". </p> <p>Hollywood has latched on to him as a character actor who can play historical figures - Sir Francis Walsingham in Shekhar Kapur's brilliant Elizabeth, Philip Henslowe in the Oscar-garlanded Shakespeare in Love, and now Sade - but he doesn't want to abandon modernity and is happy to be wearing a three-piece suit in John Boorman's forthcoming film of John le Carr\u00e9's The Tailor of Panama. </p> <p>The latter was shot last spring, but after that Rush took a five-month break. \"The last three years have been extraordinary,\" he says. \"I wanted to assess that on a personal level and on an aesthetic level. I spent time at home in a meaningful way, rather than a constantly disrupted professional way.\" His solitary engagement in that period was to appear in a production of David Holman's The Small Poppies, a play he commissioned about a child's first day at school. Very un-Hollywood; very Geoffrey Rush. </p> <p>Even Shine, in which he played the mentally unstable pianist David Helfgott, was a slow-burn triumph, giving him time to adapt to the transformation it would bring to his life. \"I read the script in 1992, and knew as an actor that the story was great, very vivid and very direct. In a strange sort of way, it fitted into a broadening repertoire of characters that I was playing on stage. Even though it was about a pianist in Perth, I found a connection through having played Lear's Fool. The film got put on hold for lots of different reasons until 1995. It finally came out at Sundance and people responded very favourably, but then it didn't open for months and months.\" </p> <p>Rush gives the impression that if the rollercoaster started by Shine careered off the track tomorrow, he wouldn't be the least bit bothered. \"An actor's life is a series of three-month blocks with great question marks constantly over the future,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"I don't really know what I'm doing after this. Things have been talked about, but nothing's set. People have this image that you must have scripts arriving by FedEx and beeping going on outside your door all the time. But it doesn't quite happen like that.\" </p> <p>Clearly, however, quite a few FedEx packages are arriving at his Melbourne home, and he is careful about what he accepts: \"There are some aesthetic guidelines at work, and there's also a sense of do-or-die daring. I keep thinking, 'Well, what do I have to lose?' It's always been the most interesting time in my theatrical life when I've deliberately not got into a rut with something. Instead of asking what my strong suit is and playing to that, you go, 'No, I'll try something totally different', just for your own amusement and your own sense of variation.\" </p> <p>At the moment, that means not accepting every historical role, every reprise of Henslowe and Walsingham, that comes his way. \"Choosing parts is based on a series of instincts and hunches,\" he says. \"It's extremely random and haphazard.\" Neither his instincts nor his aesthetic guidelines kept him out of two panned movies in 1999 - Mystery Men and House on Haunted Hill - but he makes a case for having said yes to both. </p> <p>\"I had very high hopes for Mystery Men, just in the sheer eclecticism of the cast. It was a sample of the greatest comic minds in contemporary America, from Ben Stiller to Paul Reubens to Tom Waits. It was an unusual film because it had a level of irony and fantasy which, with an Australian sensibility, I understood really well: the idea of suburban backyard superheroes. But America was baffled by it, and maybe as a film it suffered by not trusting its own instincts enough. If it had been slightly more subversive, it might have worked better.\" </p> <p>And House on Haunted Hill? \"It was a time for genre-hopping, a time to have a taste of what my current fortune had given me, and I liked the idea of being in a horror film. It was jumping into a playpen that I was not at all familiar with. The director [William Malone] was a great aficionado of the horror genre - he got very excited one day, and told me that the guy doing the underwater stunts was the son of the guy that played the original Creature From the Black Lagoon. But again that film had a kind of commercial drive to it that satisfied what it set out to do. It was made for the Halloween weekend, blitzed that weekend, did all right the next weekend and then was gone. It made three times the amount of money it was made for.\" A limp defence, but we'll assume his intentions, and his attraction to the hammy role of Stephen Price, were pure. </p> <p>One point Rush makes about all these films - the failures as well as the successes - is that they involved big casts or, as the thesp in him prefers to call them, large companies of people. He clearly enjoys the buzz of collective theatrical endeavour, which is why it wasn't just his angular Elizabethan face that made Henslowe the perfect role for him. </p> <p>Rush, who grew up in Queensland, came from a resolutely non-theatrical background. His father was an accountant and his mother a shop assistant, but he fell in love with the footlights early. \"I caught the tail end of vaudeville, travelling tent shows. The tent must have held 700-800 people, like a canvas version of the Palladium with a proscenium arch down one end. They would do a variety show at night and, in the day, the same company would do an Aussie version of the traditional English panto. I went when I was six and was hooked. </p> <p>\"I ran the school drama club at high school, where we always did grand three-acters like Charley's Aunt, The Admirable Crichton, and Arsenic and Old Lace. We liked plays that had canvas doors. Then I went to the University of Queensland at a time, in the late 60s, when the world was shifting at an enormous rate. It was a giddy time with police raiding our local record shop to confiscate copies of Hair.\" </p> <p> He got a job with the newly-formed Queensland theatre company, where he spent three years, and in the mid-1970s studied for two years at the Lecoq school of mime, movement and theatre in Paris. \"I could have gone to the national drama school in Sydney, but I felt I would be doing more of the same. I knew my preference and facility was for something a little European, something physical.\" </p> <p>He must love the stage because he married an actress, Jane Menelaus, who plays Sade's estranged wife in Quills, and they appeared together in The Importance of Being Earnest while on their honeymoon in 1988. They have two children, aged seven and five. Rush says he manages to spend around 60% of his time at home in Australia, with the rest split between the UK and US. </p> <p>He has never appeared in London's West End, but would like to give it a shot, though on his own terms and not as a visiting Hollywood celeb. \"It would be a great challenge, but I feel more and more that I would like to extend a greeting from our side of the world and bring something over with the company I work with.\" </p> <p>As for his film future, he realises that Hollywood can be a fickle master. \"You look for precedents: people from a theatre background who were heroes before I got into film acting, like Gary Oldman, Daniel Day-Lewis and Alan Rickman. You look at their careers and think there's a period of good fortune, there's a period of excitement, and then a period of boredom and indifference to it because it's not giving you back what you put into it.\" </p> <p>If that happens to him, Rush knows he has his old love to fall back on. \"I've always been a lifer. I've always liked the idea from my very early days as a professional actor that I could do it for a living. When I was in my 20s, I worked with actors who were in their 70s. That's the washing line that I want to hang it out on.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Quills opens on January 19.</p>",

He chainsmokes and wears the battered outfit he perfected in the 20 years he spent on the Australian stage before Shine brought him to the attention of Hollywood. He comes across as a human being, and there can be no greater compliment for an actor, especially one enjoying - albeit relatively late - a meteoric film career. It is probably his stage work, past and present (he has no intention of letting it go), that has kept him sane. He has been attached to the Belvoir Street Theatre in Sydney since 1985, working principally with director Neil Armfield and achieving notable successes with Gogol, Chekhov, Jonson and Beaumarchais, exploring what Rush calls \"the grubby corners of the classical repertoire\". Hollywood has latched on to him as a character actor who can play historical figures - Sir Francis Walsingham in Shekhar Kapur's brilliant Elizabeth, Philip Henslowe in the Oscar-garlanded Shakespeare in Love, and now Sade - but he doesn't want to abandon modernity and is happy to be wearing a three-piece suit in John Boorman's forthcoming film of John le Carr\u00e9's The Tailor of Panama. The latter was shot last spring, but after that Rush took a five-month break. \"The last three years have been extraordinary,\" he says. \"I wanted to assess that on a personal level and on an aesthetic level. I spent time at home in a meaningful way, rather than a constantly disrupted professional way.\" His solitary engagement in that period was to appear in a production of David Holman's The Small Poppies, a play he commissioned about a child's first day at school. Very un-Hollywood; very Geoffrey Rush. Even Shine, in which he played the mentally unstable pianist David Helfgott, was a slow-burn triumph, giving him time to adapt to the transformation it would bring to his life. \"I read the script in 1992, and knew as an actor that the story was great, very vivid and very direct. In a strange sort of way, it fitted into a broadening repertoire of characters that I was playing on stage. Even though it was about a pianist in Perth, I found a connection through having played Lear's Fool. The film got put on hold for lots of different reasons until 1995. It finally came out at Sundance and people responded very favourably, but then it didn't open for months and months.\" Rush gives the impression that if the rollercoaster started by Shine careered off the track tomorrow, he wouldn't be the least bit bothered. \"An actor's life is a series of three-month blocks with great question marks constantly over the future,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"I don't really know what I'm doing after this. Things have been talked about, but nothing's set. People have this image that you must have scripts arriving by FedEx and beeping going on outside your door all the time. But it doesn't quite happen like that.\" Clearly, however, quite a few FedEx packages are arriving at his Melbourne home, and he is careful about what he accepts: \"There are some aesthetic guidelines at work, and there's also a sense of do-or-die daring. I keep thinking, 'Well, what do I have to lose?' It's always been the most interesting time in my theatrical life when I've deliberately not got into a rut with something. Instead of asking what my strong suit is and playing to that, you go, 'No, I'll try something totally different', just for your own amusement and your own sense of variation.\" At the moment, that means not accepting every historical role, every reprise of Henslowe and Walsingham, that comes his way. \"Choosing parts is based on a series of instincts and hunches,\" he says. \"It's extremely random and haphazard.\" Neither his instincts nor his aesthetic guidelines kept him out of two panned movies in 1999 - Mystery Men and House on Haunted Hill - but he makes a case for having said yes to both. \"I had very high hopes for Mystery Men, just in the sheer eclecticism of the cast. It was a sample of the greatest comic minds in contemporary America, from Ben Stiller to Paul Reubens to Tom Waits. It was an unusual film because it had a level of irony and fantasy which, with an Australian sensibility, I understood really well: the idea of suburban backyard superheroes. But America was baffled by it, and maybe as a film it suffered by not trusting its own instincts enough. If it had been slightly more subversive, it might have worked better.\" And House on Haunted Hill? \"It was a time for genre-hopping, a time to have a taste of what my current fortune had given me, and I liked the idea of being in a horror film. It was jumping into a playpen that I was not at all familiar with. The director [William Malone] was a great aficionado of the horror genre - he got very excited one day, and told me that the guy doing the underwater stunts was the son of the guy that played the original Creature From the Black Lagoon. But again that film had a kind of commercial drive to it that satisfied what it set out to do. It was made for the Halloween weekend, blitzed that weekend, did all right the next weekend and then was gone. It made three times the amount of money it was made for.\" A limp defence, but we'll assume his intentions, and his attraction to the hammy role of Stephen Price, were pure. One point Rush makes about all these films - the failures as well as the successes - is that they involved big casts or, as the thesp in him prefers to call them, large companies of people. He clearly enjoys the buzz of collective theatrical endeavour, which is why it wasn't just his angular Elizabethan face that made Henslowe the perfect role for him. Rush, who grew up in Queensland, came from a resolutely non-theatrical background. His father was an accountant and his mother a shop assistant, but he fell in love with the footlights early. \"I caught the tail end of vaudeville, travelling tent shows. The tent must have held 700-800 people, like a canvas version of the Palladium with a proscenium arch down one end. They would do a variety show at night and, in the day, the same company would do an Aussie version of the traditional English panto. I went when I was six and was hooked. \"I ran the school drama club at high school, where we always did grand three-acters like Charley's Aunt, The Admirable Crichton, and Arsenic and Old Lace. We liked plays that had canvas doors. Then I went to the University of Queensland at a time, in the late 60s, when the world was shifting at an enormous rate. It was a giddy time with police raiding our local record shop to confiscate copies of Hair.\" He got a job with the newly-formed Queensland theatre company, where he spent three years, and in the mid-1970s studied for two years at the Lecoq school of mime, movement and theatre in Paris. \"I could have gone to the national drama school in Sydney, but I felt I would be doing more of the same. I knew my preference and facility was for something a little European, something physical.\" He must love the stage because he married an actress, Jane Menelaus, who plays Sade's estranged wife in Quills, and they appeared together in The Importance of Being Earnest while on their honeymoon in 1988. They have two children, aged seven and five. Rush says he manages to spend around 60% of his time at home in Australia, with the rest split between the UK and US. He has never appeared in London's West End, but would like to give it a shot, though on his own terms and not as a visiting Hollywood celeb. \"It would be a great challenge, but I feel more and more that I would like to extend a greeting from our side of the world and bring something over with the company I work with.\" As for his film future, he realises that Hollywood can be a fickle master. \"You look for precedents: people from a theatre background who were heroes before I got into film acting, like Gary Oldman, Daniel Day-Lewis and Alan Rickman. You look at their careers and think there's a period of good fortune, there's a period of excitement, and then a period of boredom and indifference to it because it's not giving you back what you put into it.\" If that happens to him, Rush knows he has his old love to fall back on. \"I've always been a lifer. I've always liked the idea from my very early days as a professional actor that I could do it for a living. When I was in my 20s, I worked with actors who were in their 70s. That's the washing line that I want to hang it out on.\" \u0095 Quills opens on January 19.",

Liberty Surf declined to comment on the rumours. </p> <p>However, a source close to Liberty Surf's London-based operations said it was a case of \"French journalists in silly season\". </p> <p>The ISP is the second largest in France but has only 730,000 users across Europe. Italian rival Tiscali and Belgian telecoms operator Belgacom have confirmed that they are negotiating merger deals with the company, which has \u00a3166m left in the bank and lost \u00a353m over the last six months. </p> <p>A streamlined Liberty Surf would be a more attractive target for firms wary of taking on struggling companies, but who want a foothold in the lucrative European ISP market. </p> <p>UK retail group Kingfisher has a significant stake in the company, and has watched Liberty Surf's shares crash from a year-high of \u00a324 to \u00a34.51 today. </p> <p>Analysts remain sceptical about Liberty Surf's chances of breaking even, even if it takes drastic cost-cutting measures. </p> <p>The company's business model of offering customers fixed-rate access fees while it pays telecoms companies a per-minute rate to rent phone lines is seen as unviable.</p>",

      "bodyText": "French internet service provider Liberty Surf is planning to close its UK office with the loss of 120 jobs, according to reports. Liberty Surf is negotiating a life-saving takeover as it battles to stay afloat in a rapidly consolidating industry, prompting rumours of swingeing cutbacks in its foreign operations. The report, in French daily newspaper Les Echos, claims the company will close its operations in Britain, Spain and Sweden to boost its dwindling bank balance. Liberty Surf declined to comment on the rumours. However, a source close to Liberty Surf's London-based operations said it was a case of \"French journalists in silly season\". The ISP is the second largest in France but has only 730,000 users across Europe. Italian rival Tiscali and Belgian telecoms operator Belgacom have confirmed that they are negotiating merger deals with the company, which has \u00a3166m left in the bank and lost \u00a353m over the last six months. A streamlined Liberty Surf would be a more attractive target for firms wary of taking on struggling companies, but who want a foothold in the lucrative European ISP market. UK retail group Kingfisher has a significant stake in the company, and has watched Liberty Surf's shares crash from a year-high of \u00a324 to \u00a34.51 today. Analysts remain sceptical about Liberty Surf's chances of breaking even, even if it takes drastic cost-cutting measures. The company's business model of offering customers fixed-rate access fees while it pays telecoms companies a per-minute rate to rent phone lines is seen as unviable.",

      "body": "<p>The life of the Punjabi-born singer and actress Noor Jehan, who has died aged 74, broadly mirrored the history of the film and music industry in the Indian subcontinent, before and after partition in 1947. Popularly acclaimed in Pakistan as Malak-I-Taranum - the Queen of Melody - she is estimated to have made more than 40 films and sung around 20,000 numbers during a career which lasted more than half a century.</p> <p>In 1965, when the Pakistani military elite led the country into an ill-planned war with India, Noor Jehan used her talent to shore up the spirit of her country's fighting soldiers. It was she, rather than incompetent generals, that Pakistan's public credited with boosting morale. Yet her music also provided a common bridge and a platform for the shared cultural heritage of the divided states of India and Pakistan. One of her great hits, Awaz Dey Kahan Hey (Call Up My Name With The Ardour Of Youth) still prefaces one of All India Radio's popular programmes.</p> <p>Born into a poor but musically talented family in the small, sleepy Punjabi town of Kasur, in what is now Pakistan, Allarakhi, as she was originally named, rose to all-India prominence as a child actress in early 1930s Calcutta. In 1935, her precocious talents caught the notice of KD Mehra, who signed her up for his film Pind Di Kuri (A Village Girl). Its success sparked a steady wave of acting and singing offers. The next box-office success, Gul Bakowli (1937), consolidated Jehan's child prodigy reputation.</p> <p>In 1942, while still only 15 years old, Jehan starred as the heroine in the hit movie Khandan (The Family). She later married the film's director Shaukat Hussain Rizvi, and their creative partnership produced a stream of roles in the 1940s and early 50s. Among the most successful films of the period were Mirza Sahibaan and Jugnoo (1947), which launched the career of another Bollywood legend, Dillip Kumar.</p> <p>Following partition in 1947, Jehan left Bombay for Pakistan. Between then and 1960, she acted and sang in a string of films, although, in the late 1950s, her first marriage broke up. Ghalib was her last appearance as actress-cum-singer.</p> <p>Noor Jehan then devoted herself entirely to her first love, music. Using her firm grounding in classical music, she sang Urdu film and Punjabi folk songs with equal felicity. Her 1970s hits remain in the subcontinent's popular memory even today.</p> <p>She earned the ire of Pakistan's then dictator, General Ayub Khan, when she sang a banned poem of the much-loved poet and b\u00eate noire of the regime, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, at an event organised for Ayub. Moved by this gesture, Faiz is said to have gifted the poem to her. Her life also inspired the leading Urdu writer Manto to write a sketch, Noor Jehan, Surooray Jehan, about her.</p> <p>Jehan's death united the Indian subcontinent in grief - a tribute both to a warm, vivacious personality and to the unifying potential of her songs. She is survived by two sons and four daughters from her two marriages. Her second husband was the actor, producer and director Izaz Durrani. One of her daughters, Zilay Huma, is a popular singer in the tradition of her mother.</p> <p><b>Haresh Pandya writes:</b> Outside Pakistan, Noor Jehan endeared herself to music lovers in India, the gulf countries and even in the far east. Yet she remained modest about her achievements. \"We singers are nothing,\" she once said. \"We put the ready-made dish before you through the medium of our voice.\"</p> <p>The distinguished Indian music director Naushad Ali, meanwhile, maintained that Noor Jehan was a better singer than the Indian music industry's 71-year-old \"queen empress\" - and another singer of patriotic songs - Lata Mangeshkar. The two women were close friends, chatting on the phone, corresponding across that 53-year-old border.</p> <p>\u0095 Noor Jehan (Allarakhi) singer and actress born September 21 1926; died December 23 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "The life of the Punjabi-born singer and actress Noor Jehan, who has died aged 74, broadly mirrored the history of the film and music industry in the Indian subcontinent, before and after partition in 1947. Popularly acclaimed in Pakistan as Malak-I-Taranum - the Queen of Melody - she is estimated to have made more than 40 films and sung around 20,000 numbers during a career which lasted more than half a century. In 1965, when the Pakistani military elite led the country into an ill-planned war with India, Noor Jehan used her talent to shore up the spirit of her country's fighting soldiers. It was she, rather than incompetent generals, that Pakistan's public credited with boosting morale. Yet her music also provided a common bridge and a platform for the shared cultural heritage of the divided states of India and Pakistan. One of her great hits, Awaz Dey Kahan Hey (Call Up My Name With The Ardour Of Youth) still prefaces one of All India Radio's popular programmes. Born into a poor but musically talented family in the small, sleepy Punjabi town of Kasur, in what is now Pakistan, Allarakhi, as she was originally named, rose to all-India prominence as a child actress in early 1930s Calcutta. In 1935, her precocious talents caught the notice of KD Mehra, who signed her up for his film Pind Di Kuri (A Village Girl). Its success sparked a steady wave of acting and singing offers. The next box-office success, Gul Bakowli (1937), consolidated Jehan's child prodigy reputation. In 1942, while still only 15 years old, Jehan starred as the heroine in the hit movie Khandan (The Family). She later married the film's director Shaukat Hussain Rizvi, and their creative partnership produced a stream of roles in the 1940s and early 50s. Among the most successful films of the period were Mirza Sahibaan and Jugnoo (1947), which launched the career of another Bollywood legend, Dillip Kumar. Following partition in 1947, Jehan left Bombay for Pakistan. Between then and 1960, she acted and sang in a string of films, although, in the late 1950s, her first marriage broke up. Ghalib was her last appearance as actress-cum-singer. Noor Jehan then devoted herself entirely to her first love, music. Using her firm grounding in classical music, she sang Urdu film and Punjabi folk songs with equal felicity. Her 1970s hits remain in the subcontinent's popular memory even today. She earned the ire of Pakistan's then dictator, General Ayub Khan, when she sang a banned poem of the much-loved poet and b\u00eate noire of the regime, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, at an event organised for Ayub. Moved by this gesture, Faiz is said to have gifted the poem to her. Her life also inspired the leading Urdu writer Manto to write a sketch, Noor Jehan, Surooray Jehan, about her. Jehan's death united the Indian subcontinent in grief - a tribute both to a warm, vivacious personality and to the unifying potential of her songs. She is survived by two sons and four daughters from her two marriages. Her second husband was the actor, producer and director Izaz Durrani. One of her daughters, Zilay Huma, is a popular singer in the tradition of her mother. Haresh Pandya writes: Outside Pakistan, Noor Jehan endeared herself to music lovers in India, the gulf countries and even in the far east. Yet she remained modest about her achievements. \"We singers are nothing,\" she once said. \"We put the ready-made dish before you through the medium of our voice.\" The distinguished Indian music director Naushad Ali, meanwhile, maintained that Noor Jehan was a better singer than the Indian music industry's 71-year-old \"queen empress\" - and another singer of patriotic songs - Lata Mangeshkar. The two women were close friends, chatting on the phone, corresponding across that 53-year-old border. \u0095 Noor Jehan (Allarakhi) singer and actress born September 21 1926; died December 23 2000",

      "body": "<p>Getting to meet Peggy Salinger is not an entirely straightforward matter. Certain precautions are taken whose very nature I am not permitted to describe, because that is one of the precautions. They are dictated by the \"threat management\" firm she has hired. </p> <p>It is Holden Caulfield's revenge. The angry adolescent antihero of The Catcher in the Rye retains his hold on those who worship his creator, the great and mysterious JD Salinger, who stopped writing 35 years ago and withdrew from the world to a fortress of privacy at his home in Cornish, New Hampshire. </p> <p>But he has been betrayed from within. His 44-year-old daughter, Peggy (Margaret) has written a memoir, from which the writer emerges mostly as an unsavoury weirdo. Now Peggy's father and brother are not talking to her, and a company is protecting her from the assortment of stalkers and weirdos who still apparently tout their paperback editions of The Catcher in the Rye like an avenging bible, 20 years after one such obsessed fan, Mark David Chapman, shot John Lennon dead in New York. </p> <p>Peggy has her own ideas about why her father's novel of an unhappy youth at an expensive boarding school has become such a fetish and a curse. \"It captures the borderline aspects of adolescence brilliantly, beautifully; how well he writes about what it's like to be on your own and appropriately, adolescently crazy - not having anything sorted out. Everyone's the good guys or the bad guys,\" she says. </p> <p>\"His writing is tremendously seductive. Holden turns aside to the reader and says: 'You would have understood. You would have hated this,' and brings the reader very actively into this sort of circle of elite misunderstood.\" This is all very well if you are 15, but a bit of a problem if you are in your 30s or 40s, still feel the world is against you, and believe only Holden or JD would truly understand. </p> <p>It is not just the nutters who are upset. Some of the English professors and literary arbiters at US universities and newspapers are also not too happy with Dream Catcher, her account of growing up as Salinger's daughter. One reviewer in the Indianapolis Star predicted that she would be consigned to a special hell reserved for faithless children who try to capitalise on their parents' fame. The New York Times portrayed her father as a conscientious objector to the \"publicity industrial complex\", fatally let down by a daughter who failed to understand his art. And the New York Observer declared she had committed something it called an \"ontological sin\", whatever that is. </p> <p>In the deliberate elegance of an expensive Boston hotel, Peggy sticks two fingers down her throat in mock disgust. She is unapologetic. For her, Jerome David Salinger is not a literary god but an all-too-mortal father who largely left his children to their own devices while he pursued his art, a string of obscure religions and a series of teenage girls. </p> <p>Peggy's English mother, Claire Douglas, was 16 when she met the 31-year-old writer in New York. Much later, on what turned out to be their last \"family holiday\" together, Peggy and her eight-year-old younger brother, Matthew, were thrilled to be flown to London, only to discover that the hidden agenda behind the trip was a rendezvous with her father's besotted female pen pal, who was still in her teens. The hapless girl was ultimately cast out in tears, because JD did not fancy her. \"She's terribly homely, poor girl. I had no idea,\" Peggy recalls him saying. </p> <p>Peggy describes how she was dispatched to one Colditz-style boarding school after another, and unsurprisingly developed a few personality problems of her own. She drank, ran wild, had occasional blackouts during which she assumed multiple personalities, and suffered from debilitating illnesses. On one occasion when she rang her father for help, he sent her a subscription to a journal put out by the Christian Scientists, his religious gurus of the moment, who teach that all illness is an illusion. </p> <p>Her devotion to the old man was such that when she finally attempted suicide in 1984, she rang the hospital before she took her cocktail of pills to ensure they would not release her name to the press. \"My first instinct at this desperate hour was not to protect myself, but to keep my father's secrets, to obey the family creed,\" she wrote. </p> <p>The ties of loyalty only snapped when she was pregnant with her son some years ago (to say precisely when would reveal the age of her son, which she views as a risk - the fewer identifying details the better). She was sick and penniless, and her father advised her to get an abortion. \"You have no right to bring a child into the world you can't support,\" he told her. She was so taken aback that she wrote the words down; this was the start of the long process which eventually produced Dream Catcher. </p> <p>\"Being the mother of a child brought out that lioness,\" she says now. \"You can say what you want to me, but don't go there. That's what knocked down the house of cards. </p> <p>\"Really, the only way I came to understand why it took me so long was reading the literature on cults and people emerging from cults and how when you're forced to believe in the whole package you can't disagree with discrete bits of it. Because really, the whole thing has to fall apart for you to start questioning.\" </p> <p>Writing Dream Catcher was not facilitated by the fact that Peggy's father refused to talk to her after word leaked out that she was working on the book. She had to rely on her own memory and the recollections of the various women in the reclusive author's life. </p> <p>The result is patchily compelling. She writes at great length about episodes she remembers best, which are not always the most absorbing moments of her life. There are seemingly endless quotes from scrawled notes slipped to and from her giggling friends at boarding school. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the best bits throw light on her famously secretive father. He told her almost nothing about his experiences as a soldier in the 1944 D-day landings and in the subsequent advance across Europe, but she has dug out the bloody history of his unit, the 12th Infantry Regiment, which lost more men than it started out with. It was a wonder that Jerry Salinger survived at all. \"You never really get the smell of burning flesh out of your nose entirely,\" he once told her, \"no matter how long you live.\" </p> <p>For the rest of his life, Peggy believes, he remained essentially a soldier, disciplined and aloof from ordinary civilians. \"While the war was often in the foreground of our family life, it was always in the background. It was the point of reference that defined everything else in relation to it,\" she wrote. </p> <p>The other dark corner she has taken a torch to is his largely ignored Jewish heritage. Jerome's father was a successful Jewish food importer and his mother was an Irish Catholic who converted to Judaism, making Sonny (as his relatives called him) entirely Jewish. It was an identity he did not embrace. </p> <p>\"My father would get all embarrassed and uncomfortable when the subject would come out. It would be a subject not to be discussed,\" Peggy recalls. As for her grandparents: \"All I knew was that they were incredibly embarrassing people because they spoke with Yiddish accents and they were dismissed.\" </p> <p> Some of JD's characters have similar attitudes to their families' histories, but none act out the conflicts in such a bizarre manner as the author, whose first marriage was to a Nazi. Serving as a counter-intelligence officer at the end of the war, he was one of the first soldiers to walk into a newly liberated concentration camp (Peggy is unable to remember its name). He was responsible for interrogating the local Nazis and one of the junior party officials he arrested, Sylvia, he fell for, married and took back to America. According to his sister, Doris, Sylvia remained as anti-semitic as ever, and returned to Germany. The bizarre episode gives new dimensions to the phrase \"self-hating Jew\". </p> <p>As far as his daughter knows, JD Salinger is still writing. \"He does work from early in the morning till midday every day, and when he can't he's a huge pain in the ass. He starts prowling like a caged beast, and he really has got to get to his typewriter,\" she says. The output is all carefully filed away and colour coded according to how much editing it requires, waiting to be published after his death. But it is quite possible, she admits, that he will simply change his mind and make a huge bonfire of the past three decades' worth of work, an act that her revelations may have rendered more likely. </p> <p>In writing Dream Catcher, Peggy has taken an axe to the delicate, residual strands keeping her troubled family together. Her brother, Matthew, wrote a letter to the New York Observer denouncing the book and questioning its accuracy. </p> <p>Peggy is equally dismissive of her brother, saying she was \"embarrassed for him\". \"He hasn't spoken to me,\" she says with evident sadness mixed with iron determination. \"I'm still his big sister. I'm sorry he didn't have the oomph to say something to me about it and instead wrote a letter to the press. I'm not dwelling on it. I think in a few years he'll probably be quite embarrassed by his own behaviour. I hope for his own sake that he does some sorting through for himself.\" </p> <p>She stands by the authenticity of her account, and argues with some degree of pride that if there were factual errors, her father would have taken her to the supreme court, as he did to his previous biographer, Ian Hamilton. She says this with some pride, but it is clearly a melancholy situation for any family when the best thing you can say about relations with your father is that he has not taken you to the highest court in the land, yet. She has not dared to contact her father since word got out that she was writing the book. \"I did not want to subject my son to a scene, and I also didn't care to be yelled at, so call me chicken,\" she says. </p> <p>When I ask her whether she feels a sense of loss, being cut off from her father and the idol of her youth, she has two answers ready. \"Rationally, no, because what I realised was that there wasn't that much there to begin with at that stage. Irrationally, yes, there's always a wish. Certainly I love my father and I want my daddy to be the perfect daddy he was when I was a little girl. The loss of a wish, of something that doesn't exist, can hurt just as much as something that is quite real.\" </p> <p>Outside the hotel room, the early afternoon light is already beginning to fade over the snow on Boston common, and Peggy is ready for her photograph. The portrait on the back of her book shows the new Peggy, hap pily married, a mother and seemingly at peace. The woman now adjusting her make-up has cut her hair short and is wearing a no-nonsense suit. She is harried and nervous about the press. A freelance photographer working for a British newspaper has been harassing her family and her neighbours for days. She has taken on the burdens her father has spent most of his life avoiding. </p> <p>But throughout the two-hour interview her heaviest load seems to be the nagging, unanswerable question of whether she has done the right thing. It is something she returns to again and again. </p> <p>\"Certainly my intention was not to demonise or point the finger at anyone,\" she says at one point. \"My father sets up these sort of guru-acolyte relations where either you're perfect or you're damned, and I really try to sort out for myself who this human being was, is, who I'd never considered as a human being. I don't think it's disrespectful to a human being to take him off a pedestal. Quite the opposite. I feel any time you put a human being on a pedestal . . . it's dehumanising, whether you're pillorying him or worshipping him.\" </p> <p>That is what is wrong with the Catcher in the Rye nutters, the Mark Chapmans of this world. They fail to see the human being behind the pages. In her own eyes, Peggy Salinger is only trying to make those pages more transparent. </p> <p>She says: \"If I have discouraged past and present and future readers from seeking out the writer, the creator of a fiction, as someone who will be their catcher, I don't think that's a bad thing.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Dream Catcher by Peggy Salinger is published by Scribner, price \u00a320.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis today announced he is to stand down at the next general election - but insisted his party could hold on to his Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat. His decision will come as a blow to his party leader, David Trimble, who counts Mr Maginnis as a close ally. Mr Trimble has faced challenges to his leadership over his support for the Good Friday Agreement. A selection meeting to find the UUP's replacement candidate is expected before the end of the month. But many observers feel that if a strong republican candidate was put forward the party could struggle to keep the seat Mr Maginnis has held for 18 years. A UUP security spokesman acknowledged that the next election would be closely contested. \"If you do a sectarian head count in Fermanagh and South Tyrone you'll find that it's touch and go either way,\" he said. Mr Maginnis stressed that his party's record in trying to find a solution to the difficulties facing Northern Ireland could hold the key to success. \"I believe that unionism can hold the seat in so far as unionism, particularly Ulster Unionism, has been constructive,\" he said. \"We have actually been a party that has tackled the problems and looked ahead rather than rested on our prejudices and the prejudices of the past.\" Mr Maginnis, 62, said that as \"the engine's still good\" health had not been a prime reason in his decision to stand down. The former schoolteacher, soldier and businessman said he felt it was time to devote more time to other pursuits. His high-profile role within the party has not come without a price, including terrorist attempts on his life. And he admitted resenting members of the unionist community who showed unwillingness to change or to embrace the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. \"One of the things I resented was that people came out in their hundreds of thousands to vote yes at the referendum and then they sat back and thought that they had done their bit for God and Ulster, from whatever perspective, unionist or nationalist and they really hadn't,\" he said. \"They had a responsibility to get out at the election and share the problems of taking this society ahead rather than saying, 'Oh, we did our bit, now we'll leave it up to Ken Maginnis or David Trimble or whoever'.\" Despite his decision to take a back seat in future, Mr Maginnis added that it was unlikely he would disappear totally from public view. \"One way or another I do want to see progress, remember I have come through 18 years of ups and downs.

      "bodyText": "As the German government holds 'mad cow' crisis talks in Berlin, fast food chain McDonald's has launched a burger made entirely out of pork in a bid to protect its sales there. The McFarmer burger, which is unique to Germany at present, will be promoted by its local roster agency, DDB worldwide-owned Heye &amp; Partner Munich, via a TV and radio campaign. McDonald's move to sell pork burgers comes as German consumers become increasingly concerned about eating beef. Although there have only been eight reported cases of BSE since 1997 compared with 11,030 in the UK, there has been a fall in demand for beef products since the first German BSE case was reported on November 24. When the UK BSE scare was at its peak in the mid-90s, McDonald's was forced into PR crisis management but did not launch the pork burger here. MPs are today questioning health and agriculture ministers about allegations that the German public has been misled over the safety of beef. Before Christmas McDonald's embarked on a massive ad campaign in Italy to allay public fears over beef safety, despite no case of BSE being reported there.",

      "body": "<p>Tim Cole ruined his chance to make the grade as a professional footballer with Tottenham Hotspur because he always arrived at the club wearing an Arsenal shirt. </p> <p>\"I played for all the youth teams at White Hart Lane,\" he explains. \"But wearing a Gunners strip every time I turned up for training didn't go down too well. In the end they got fed up with it and let me go. Arsenal have always been my team.\" </p> <p>Instead of professional football Cole, 24, now earns a living lifting carcasses around London's Smithfield meat market. But tomorrow, when he plays for the Conference side Dagenham and Redbridge against Charlton Athletic at The Valley in the FA Cup third round, he has a belated chance of football glory. The tie is the talk of the East End, where another Cole is usually at the centre of the conversation. </p> <p>Cole, the Dagenham centre-half and vice-captain, cannot afford a mistake tomorrow. \"Whenever I do anything wrong I get stick from the lads because I'm up at one o'clock every morning to go to work and they put it down to that. </p> <p>\"We only train twice a week. On Tuesday - to get rid of the weekend beer - and on Thursday when we do a bit of ball work. I usually go straight to work from training. I've been doing this job for over two years now.\" </p> <p>Cole, who was turned down after a trial with Wimbledon, has a clear idea of what the tactics will be. \"I think we might have to kick a few early on, in the nicest possible way of course. We've got to compete and get stuck in and I won't be surprised if there are a few yellow cards early on. </p> <p>\"Charlton have run into some great form lately. But they're resting a few, which might give us a chance. We just can't let them knock it around all afternoon. If we can take them back to our place it will be a great result.\" </p> <p>Cole is a throwback to the romantic, butcher-baker-candlestick maker image of the Cup's third round, when so many amateur players were famous for 90 minutes. </p> <p>These days, though, the non-league clubs are professional or at least, as in the case of Dagenham, semi-pro.

      "bodyText": "Tim Cole ruined his chance to make the grade as a professional footballer with Tottenham Hotspur because he always arrived at the club wearing an Arsenal shirt. \"I played for all the youth teams at White Hart Lane,\" he explains. \"But wearing a Gunners strip every time I turned up for training didn't go down too well. In the end they got fed up with it and let me go. Arsenal have always been my team.\" Instead of professional football Cole, 24, now earns a living lifting carcasses around London's Smithfield meat market. But tomorrow, when he plays for the Conference side Dagenham and Redbridge against Charlton Athletic at The Valley in the FA Cup third round, he has a belated chance of football glory. The tie is the talk of the East End, where another Cole is usually at the centre of the conversation. Cole, the Dagenham centre-half and vice-captain, cannot afford a mistake tomorrow. \"Whenever I do anything wrong I get stick from the lads because I'm up at one o'clock every morning to go to work and they put it down to that. \"We only train twice a week. On Tuesday - to get rid of the weekend beer - and on Thursday when we do a bit of ball work. I usually go straight to work from training. I've been doing this job for over two years now.\" Cole, who was turned down after a trial with Wimbledon, has a clear idea of what the tactics will be. \"I think we might have to kick a few early on, in the nicest possible way of course. We've got to compete and get stuck in and I won't be surprised if there are a few yellow cards early on. \"Charlton have run into some great form lately. But they're resting a few, which might give us a chance. We just can't let them knock it around all afternoon. If we can take them back to our place it will be a great result.\" Cole is a throwback to the romantic, butcher-baker-candlestick maker image of the Cup's third round, when so many amateur players were famous for 90 minutes. These days, though, the non-league clubs are professional or at least, as in the case of Dagenham, semi-pro. Dagenham, who merged with Redbridge Forest in 1992, lost the FA Trophy final in 1997 and last season won the Ryman League Premier Division title by 24 points. \"It's the atmosphere I'm looking forward to more than anything,\" says Cole. \"The biggest crowd I've played in front of before was about 6,000, at Peterborough.

      "body": "<p>The year 2001 has got off to the best start possible with this fantastic film. Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a martial arts movie in a traditional Chinese action idiom which manages to be both electrifyingly exciting and sweetly romantic - qualities wrapped up in the preternatural innocence of a fairy tale. </p> <p>Chow Yun-Fat plays the legendary warrior Li Mu Bai, deeply in love with Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), the fiercest female martial arts practitioner in China but, through a combination of male pride and reticence, he is unable to declare his passion - and she, too, because of loyalty to a fiance now dead, cannot admit what she feels for him. </p> <p>The delicate sadness and internalising of their love unfolds in parallel with the blazing passion of another couple: Jen (Zhang Ziyi), a gorgeous young aristocrat, has formed a secret liaison with outlaw Lo (Chang Chen), but she yearns for the life of the warrior and steals the Green Destiny, Li Mu Bai's precious sword, richly and exquisitely carved and inlaid. </p> <p>Until seeing this film, I had long thought that some kind of moratorium ought to be declared on the indiscriminate use of the word \"balletic\" to describe fight scenes - a naive cliche generally used by those who have never seen a real fight, or indeed a ballet, in their lives. </p> <p>But no other word will do for the sublime perfection of these action sequences which Ang Lee's touch - and that of choreographer Yuen Wo Ping of Matrix fame, and cinematographer Peter Pau - have realised with such extraordinary flair. There is real poetry and artistry in the way the visual images are assembled which lifts this film miles above the crudeness of berk flicks like Romeo Must Die. </p> <p>In one scene, the brutal clash of fists and weaponry disturbs the birds in the trees and Lee interrupts our view of the fight briefly, in favour of an epiphanic vision of the birds ascending into the sky: a pleasing moment of inspiration which anticipates the climactic fight between Jen and Li Mu Bai as they float through the treetops themselves: in its exuberance and charm, it has to be one of the most beautiful moments in modern cinema. </p> <p>Crouching Tiger adopts the convention of the wu xia martial arts stories: in formal combat, the rules of gravity are suspended, and with them the rules of narrative and ordinary human possibility - bringing into the action genre a delirious new sort of magic realism. It grafts onto it a kind of fabular quality, which confers such distinction on the film, but leaves intact the thrills of the fight scenes themselves. </p> <p>The opening punch-up is not vouchsafed to us straight after the credits, or even during the credits, in the way we have come to expect from any action picture, but after 10 self-effacing minutes of exposition. Only then does Lee unleash Yu Shu Lien's thrilling rooftop chase with the masked intruder: a fight of incredible strangeness, stark moonlit mystery - and delirious excitement. If you're too cool to be excited by it, then you're too cool. With its pointed intensity and the compelling, single drumbeat on the soundtrack, it's an action sequence to treble the heart rate and cause the skin to prickle with goosepimples. </p> <p>Ang Lee's achievement is to reconnect the genre with its innate, latent sense of decorum and romance, qualities which have been ignored, or treated ironically or unintelligently. Crouching Tiger juxtaposes the fatal secrets of martial arts with those of meditation and even calligraphy, and persuades us to take them equally seriously. Added to the miniaturist's skill in rendering the delicate touches of the principals' hidden love, he has an epic sense of space and landscape, moving lightly from Peking to the desert: Ang Lee puts a girdle around his earth in seconds. </p> <p>Frankly, this is what Phantom Menace was supposed to feel like. And Ang Lee must certainly win best foreign language picture Oscar this spring - or indeed best picture. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh carry off their roles with poise and charm, and the melancholy of their unspoken love has real pathos. </p> <p>In the old-fashioned entertainment that it delivers, and in its inspired combination of seriousness and playfulness, Crouching Tiger is already assuming the lineaments of a classic. And if this film proves to be the father to a series of similar works, then it could almost be that a new popular genre of film-making has been born, or reborn: a new Asian western for the 21st century.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Government helplines were today being set up amid fears that serial killer GP Harold Shipman may have killed up to 250 patients. The convicted mass murderer recorded at least 250 more deaths over 25 years than other doctors working in similar practices, an audit of his clinical practice has shown. Police had suspected that the Greater Manchester GP had killed up to 192 patients and the findings of the review of his work have been passed to detectives and the crown prosecution service, the Department of Health said. The DoH was today preparing to release more information about the study at a news conference and was setting up the helplines for families concerned that their relatives could have been killed by Shipman. Shipman is currently serving 15 life sentences after being convicted last February of the murders of 15 of his patients. He had killed his victims, all women patients at his single-handed practice in Hyde, Greater Manchester, by giving them overdoses of diamorphine, the legal term for heroin. Immediately after the GP's conviction, Health Secretary Alan Milburn ordered the independent statistical audit of Shipman's clinical practice between 1974 and 1998. The chief medical officer, Professor Liam Donaldson, commissioned Professor Richard Baker from the University of Leicester to carry out the study. He compared the number of patient deaths recorded by Shipman with those of other GPs in the same area. The study compared trends including the time of death, presence of the doctor involved and the presence of any relatives. Prof Baker did not investigate individual cases over the 24-year period, but the 250-excess death rate appears to confirm fears that Shipman killed many more people than previously thought. A Department of Health spokeswoman said today: \"The audit looked at the pattern and trends in deaths that were certified by Shipman between 1974 and 1998. \"It found an excess death rate of 250 but it looked at data. It did not look at individual cases or forensic evidence.\" She declined to say if the review had included deaths certified by Shipman while he was working as a doctor in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, before he moved to Hyde. The CPS was today unavailable for comment, but had previously said it would not be in the public interest to prosecute Shipman again when he has been sentenced to 15 life sentences. Police had said they had enough evidence to charge Shipman with the murders of a further 23 patients. A public inquiry into Shipman's crimes is set to be chaired by high court judge Dame Janet Smith and will be held in Manchester. No date has yet been announced. It was believed it could begin as early as February and Ann Alexander, the solicitor for the relatives of Shipman's relatives, said it would look at the deaths of at least 150 additional suspected victims. She said it would be \"far reaching\" and would seek to identify gaps in the system which had allowed Shipman to continue his killing spree undetected. It will also consider how he obtained drugs, altered medical records and arranged for most of his victims to be cremated without post-mortem examinations.",

      "bodyText": "Walsall may not be best known for its picturesque landscape but a critic's recent description of the Black Country town as \"Ceaucescu's Romania with fast food outlets\" has proved too much for its outraged residents. Council leader Mike Bird yesterday led the backlash against art critic Theodore Dalrymple, who launched a vicious attack on the town writing under a pseudonym in American art magazine New Criterion. The article, titled Crudity Beyond Belief, refers to Walsall as one of the \"most depressing areas of urban devastation\" in the world, dismissing the internationally acclaimed New Art Gallery as resembling a post-modernist grain silo. \"It is possible that there are uglier towns in the world than Walsall, but if so I do not know them. While Walsall undoubtedly exists, it is difficult to know where precisely it begins and ends, because it is in the middle of one of the largest and most depressing contiguous areas of urban devastation in the world,\" Mr Dalrymple claims. Mr Bird said yesterday such criticisms of the town and gallery were totally unwarranted and dismissed them as nonsense. \"I have no time for people who remain anonymous and haven't got the guts to stand up and be counted.

However, its new \u00a321m lottery-funded art gallery, designed by architects Caruso St John, brought more positive publicity to the town after bursting on to the international art map to a rapturous reception from critics around the world. Descriptions such as \"a beautiful collection of spaces\", \"a world class gallery\" and \"stunningly beautiful\" appear to be at odds with Mr Dalrymple's negative experience of the building and its surroundings. \"One veers between thinking oneself in a fascist foreign ministry and a sauna of gigantic proportions,\" he complains.

If the Federal Reserve's chairman can finesse a soft landing for the US, slowing its rate of growth to between 2.5% and 3%, it will be the crowning triumph of his illustrious career, topping even his performance in 1998 when he cut rates aggressively and orchestrated a bail-out for the troubled hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). </p> <p>But the pessimists put forward three arguments to explain why it will all end in tears.

Between May 1988 and October 1989, they rose from 7.5% to 15% and stayed at that level for 12 months. Britain came grinding to a halt in the autumn of 1990, and stayed in the doldrums for two years. Although not as severe as the slump of the early 80s, the economy contracted by 1.5% in 1991 and expanded by 0.1% in 1992. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Unemployment rose</strong>. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit stood at just under 1.6m in the spring of 1990. Two and a half years later it was nudging 3m. </p> <p>\u0095 The result of dear borrowing and longer dole queues was that many of those who bought <strong> houses</strong> during the property boom of the late 80s promptly lost them during the subsequent slump. The number of repossessions rose from 18,510 in 1988 to a record 75,540 in 1991. </p> <p>\u0095 Those who managed to keep up their monthly payments struggled with <strong> negative equity</strong>, where the loan outstanding on a property was greater than its market value. After soaring in the late 80s, house prices were flat in 1990 and then fell in each of the next three years. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Businesses big and small went bust</strong>. The number of personal bankruptcies rose four-fold from 8,138 in 1989 to 32,106 in 1992, compulsory liquidations increased from 4,020 to 9,734 over the same period, while voluntary liquidations were up from 6,436 to 14,891. Canary Wharf was lying empty. Mystery still surrounds the death of <strong> Robert Maxwell</strong>, found drowned at sea off the Canary Islands in November 1991. His Maxwell Communications Corporation faced mounting debts. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Political reputations</strong> were shredded. First to suffer was Nigel Lawson, who went from hero to villain in the space of two years as the heady expansion of 1987 and 1988 was followed by a sharp contraction. Then it was the turn of Lawson's successor, <strong> Norman Lamont</strong>, who attracted widespread scorn for his optimistic comments in the autumn of 1991 that he could spot the \"green shoots of recovery\". </p> <p>Mr Lamont was made the fall guy for the humiliation of the Conservative government on Black Wednesday, which led to Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism and was the catalyst for economic recovery. In truth, the reputation of his boss, John Major, never recovered either, although his moment of truth did not arrive until May 1997.</p>",

The number of repossessions rose from 18,510 in 1988 to a record 75,540 in 1991. \u0095 Those who managed to keep up their monthly payments struggled with negative equity, where the loan outstanding on a property was greater than its market value. After soaring in the late 80s, house prices were flat in 1990 and then fell in each of the next three years. \u0095 Businesses big and small went bust. The number of personal bankruptcies rose four-fold from 8,138 in 1989 to 32,106 in 1992, compulsory liquidations increased from 4,020 to 9,734 over the same period, while voluntary liquidations were up from 6,436 to 14,891. Canary Wharf was lying empty. Mystery still surrounds the death of Robert Maxwell, found drowned at sea off the Canary Islands in November 1991. His Maxwell Communications Corporation faced mounting debts. \u0095 Political reputations were shredded. First to suffer was Nigel Lawson, who went from hero to villain in the space of two years as the heady expansion of 1987 and 1988 was followed by a sharp contraction. Then it was the turn of Lawson's successor, Norman Lamont, who attracted widespread scorn for his optimistic comments in the autumn of 1991 that he could spot the \"green shoots of recovery\". Mr Lamont was made the fall guy for the humiliation of the Conservative government on Black Wednesday, which led to Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism and was the catalyst for economic recovery. In truth, the reputation of his boss, John Major, never recovered either, although his moment of truth did not arrive until May 1997.",

Disasters becoming routine, while politicians talk more and more of keeping people out. In Germany, Chancellor Schroder, speaking recently near the border with the Czech Republic, calls for a seven-year ban on the movement of labour from Central European countries after they join the European Union. In Italy, Silvio Berlusconi could win the coming general election on the immigration issue. </p> <p>In the United States, President Clinton has just failed to overcome opposition to legalising the residence of immigrants from a number of Central American countries. In Australia, the former prime minister Malcolm Fraser describes the asylum detention centre in remote Woomera as \"a hellhole\". In Britain, the attempt to disperse asylum seekers is in trouble, the criticisms merging into a general row over race and immigration. Fear of people remains a powerful political force everywhere. </p> <p>How much migration would there be in a better world? There would be far fewer refugees, since there would be fewer wars, fewer tyrannical states and better preparations against natural disasters. There would be less \"economic\" migration, since the differentials in income and circumstance would be smaller. If there is anything that has been established pretty much beyond doubt in studies of migration it is that the vast majority of people prefer to stay at home. The sociologist Saskia Sassen, who has examined these matters with great insight, has shown that when they do leave home, there have to be very compelling reasons, special opportunities or established habits or some combination of these three. When they nevertheless do leave, they prefer to do so on a temporary basis, returning periodically, often very frequently, to the old country. And if they do leave home permanently, they quite often change their mind and go back in the end, as did two thirds of the Italians who emigrated to the US at the turn of the century. </p> <p>Does migration show, then, that something is wrong, since it so often involves people doing what they do not really want to do? Not always or necessarily, because there appears, historically, to have been no way of achieving economic growth without creating imbalances and inequalities between countries and regions. Growth feeds on and uses such inequalities. If economic growth has been good, then labour migration, including that of skilled refugees, may in some sense have been \"necessary\". </p> <p>The modern problem of migration arises from an obvious divergence between national and international politics. National politics, especially in the better organised and more prosperous states, aimed to iron out the very distinctions and differences that gave rise, at an earlier stage, to large internal migrations - the kind that are, for instance, causing stress in China now. </p> <p>Every time a British newspaper prints one of those maps showing differentials in job losses or in rates of success in medical treatment across the country it subscribes to the principle that no region should suffer any disadvantage that it is in the power of central government to reduce. The same process eventually took place in the European Union as a whole, when countries which sent out large numbers of labour migrants as recently as 30 years ago, such as Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland, ceased to do so as their circumstances improved, an improvement aided by their membership of the union. Now that they are completely free to live anywhere in Europe, Europeans no longer move to any great extent: of the 344m citizens of the EU, only 5m work in a country which is not their country of birth. </p> <p>Even the new Europeans who will be joining in the next few years, although somewhat poorer than those in the present member states, are not expected to move in large numbers. A recent Chatham House study estimates that the numbers who will move from Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia after accession will be relatively small, with a maximum of less than 3m over 15 years, who will mainly either commute or move only temporarily. And the numbers will decline after differentials even up. </p> <p>The effects on the receiving countries are likely to be an overall net economic gain with the possibility of a slight increase in unemployment and slight downward pressure on wages. Why, in the face of projections like these, is Chancellor Schr\u00f6der angering central European governments by insisting on his seven years? Is it simply that the popular perception of an impending migrant flood cannot be shifted, however often the facts are laid out? Is it that migrants are disproportionately concentrated in particular places? The policy of dispersal of asylum seekers, who can, unlike other kinds of migrants, be ordered around, suggests that governments think this is part of the problem. Or is it that citizens are hyper-sensitive because they sense a more general threat to their security? </p> <p>Migration flows can be compared to the weather as something that can be partly understood, modestly forecast, and controlled or mitigated to some extent. They are comparable, too, in that new systems are always emerging and old ones dying out. Particular migrations, each with a specific history, come to an end, new ones begin. They are like the weather in that there is a persistent tendency to overestimate the size and duration of storms. They are like the weather in that most people do not have any great grasp of the global system that produces them. Finally they are not like the weather in that they are the outcome of human action - war making, nation building, enrichment and impoverishment - rather than of physical forces. </p> <p>A strategic idea of migration is lacking in the general debate, which so often seems to be between those who think migration good and those who deem it bad. Or else the debate is confined to the issue of tolerance - the proper moral behaviour of those in the host society - and can end in a sterile competition over racism, and in a parting of the ways between intellectuals and ordinary people. This is surely a narrowing of the argument that strips migration of its history, economics, and sociology. It is not for want of academic trying, since migration and related subjects, like diasporas, have attracted gifted scholars. </p> <p>Whether migration is part of the pathology or of the normality of modern capitalism is a high sort of question that has been answered in different ways. But it would be better if there was wider recognition that migration is part of something, that it cannot be understood or treated as an isolated phenomenon.

The company's turnover rose from \u00a3420,000 in 1999 to \u00a31.1mlast year. However, pre-tax loss jumped from \u00a331,000 to \u00a3967,000. Robert Jackson, the chief executive officer of RMR's British operations, declined to comment yesterday.",

In an article for the Daily Mail, which has been highlighting cases of \"bogus asylum seekers\" almost daily for two months now, the former deputy prime minister summed up his case on the basis of \"three stark conclusions\". The first was that \"a very large number are cheats deliberately making bogus claims and false allegations to get into this country\". In his second charge he claimed that British citizens were being pushed to the back of the queue for housing and hospital treatment by \"dubious asylum seekers\". His final conclusion was that the problem of \"phoney asylum seekers was likely to grow as the impression spread that this country was a soft touch.\" </p> <p>Mr Heseltine's real agenda lay deep in the detail of his Mail article where he made clear that the solution lies in persuading the rest of the European Union, and the United Nations if necessary, to tear up the 1951 Geneva Convention which guarantees the right of an individual fleeing persecution to seek asylum. Instead he wants to \"redefine it for the new millennium\", which is presumably code for ensuring that it is even harder for those fleeing modern day tyrannies, such as Iraq or Iran, to clamber over the walls of Fortress Europe. </p> <p>But to analyse his first charge that most asylum seekers are cheats. It is true that in the last three months the Home Office has turned down 88% of the cases it has decided in the past three months. But that masks the fact that only 48% of those cases were refused after full consideration was given to whether their claim to be suffering from persecution was genuine or unfounded. A majority - 52% - were either given full refugee status or allowed to stay on exceptional grounds or were refused without proper consideration of their case. </p> <p>As to the second claim that \"dubious\" asylum seekers were pushing British citizens to the back of the queue for housing and hospital treatment, this is the Home Office's response: \"Council taxpayers' money is not being used to house asylum seekers and therefore local people are not being disadvantaged. We are using properties that do not have a waiting list.\" The refugee organisations say this means slum housing and bed and breakfast hostels. As for hospital waiting lists, the number of asylum seekers is not a major factor: the NHS treats millions of people each week. </p> <p>Finally, is Britain a soft touch compared with the rest of Europe? Well, the system of dispersal and vouchers is the same as that which exists in Germany and within the EU there is a renewed drive to adopt a common definition of who qualifies for refugee status.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush stepped up his campaign for big tax cuts yesterday after corporate America shrugged off the impact of Wednesday's surprise lowering of US interest rates and demanded tougher action to prevent the world's biggest economy sliding towards recession. As financial markets took stock after their euphoric rise in the immediate aftermath of the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the cost of borrowing by half a percentage point, the president-elect responded to mounting pressure from company chief executives by floating plans to fast-track promised tax cuts worth $1,300bn (\u00a3900bn). With General Motors announcing last night that it is temporarily laying off 20,000 workers because of slack demand, the Fed is already facing calls for a further rate cut at the end of the month when it holds its next scheduled meeting and there are growing expectations that the Bank of England may soon follow suit. However, a reduction in the cost of UK borrowing at next week's meeting of the monetary policy committee looked less likely after figures yesterday suggested consumer demand remained robust. Mr Bush's 10-year tax cutting programme was scheduled to begin in 2002 but Larry Lindsey, the new head of the White House's economic team, said the legislation for tax cuts might have to be speeded up \"as a way of stimulating the economy\". Mr Bush was in his home state yesterday holding behind-closed-door discussions with the bosses of some of America's largest companies, including General Electric, General Motors, Dell, Intel, and Cisco Systems. Speaking in Austin, Texas, Mr Lindsey said the \"insurance policy\" of tax cuts was needed \"particularly for moderate-income people\". The Republican tax plans have been criticised by Democrats for favouring the wealthy but Mr Lindsey's mention of lower income groups was seen as a way of building cross-party support in Congress. Jack Welch, head of General Electric, called the interest rate cut just \"one step\". He said: \"What we are clearly seeing is a slowdown in the fourth quarter in consumer spending that runs the risk of spreading across the industrial sector.\" The case for action to boost demand in the UK was undermined by figures showing healthy growth in high street spending in December, accelerating activity in the services sector as a whole, and rising demand for mortgages. City economists said the data suggested the Bank of England would not be panicked into an immediate cut in the cost of borrowing, which has remained at 6% since February. However, most expect interest rates to begin falling within three months to guard against a sharp slowdown in growth. \"Taken together, this morning's numbers suggest that the case for lower interest rates is rather less urgent in the UK than in the US,\" said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. Short sterling - an indicator of future interest rate trends - is pricing in the likelihood of just over a quarter point cut by March, with a similar cut by June. David Walton, of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said the weakness of UK inflation gave the Bank of England ample scope to make bigger rate cuts if needed. Mr Bush also completed his cabinet yesterday, giving Karl Rove, his chief strategist, the White House post of senior adviser, and naming Joe Allbaugh, his campaign manager, as head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",

Let's see what happens with all these buildings, all these lofts. There is going to be a real explosion in 2003 and 2004 when the centre of Manchester is really lived in like no other city.\" </p> <p>Wilson explains his 13-year cycle theory of youth culture. He worked it out in his kitchen in 1989. He thought: 1963, the Beatles; 1976, punk. Then he went into to the office of Factory Records, saying: \"It's got to be 1989, this year. So what is it?\" The label had already signed the Happy Mondays; they were sitting on the latest thing and didn't realise. The NME didn't get there until it had already exploded.

No one wants to buy into the working-class image of the dope-smoking, rave-dancing Manc any more. It will be more inventive next time round. Less of the flowerpot men hats.\" </p> <p>Art Review magazine has been sniffing around the north to make Manchester art next month's cover story. The city that produced Chris Ofili, the first black Turner Prize winner two years ago, is now exporting a lot of painters and installation artists. Manchester artist Nick Crowe is showing at the San Francisco museum of Modern Art. David Mackintosh, Jim Medway and Graham Parker are exhibiting at A22 gallery in London - the capital's gallery owners are coming up to scour for talent. Helen Benden and Jo Landsley are exhibiting in Paris. The number of small gallery spaces is growing. Martin Vincent, an installation artist and gallery owner whose bronze plaque installation saying \"Life is good in Manchester\" hangs in the town hall, says the extension of City Art Gallery, due to reopen next year after a \u00a325m refurbishment programme, has had policy-makers clamouring for advice from small artists. \"They realise they need to rethink the scene. We're ready for a Modern Art gallery. We need a Guggenheim.\" </p> <p>On screen, Manchester's arthouse cinema, the Cornerhouse, is recently showcased the latest independent film-makers inspired by Manchester music. Carol Morley's the Alcohol Years opened the show. The younger sister of Stockport-born NME journalist and writer Paul Morley, Carol spent her teenage years in a blur of alcoholism and promiscuity in post-punk, pre-ecstasy mid-80s Manchester, involving everyone from New Order to Pete Shelley. In February 1998, she put an ad in City Life, saying: \"Carol Morley film project. Please contact me if you knew me between 1982 - 1997.\" The result is a scrapbook of their memories, praised for its shots of Manchester after dark. Also showing is Unloveable, Peter Naylor and Carl Hunter's short about Shed, a self-styled Smiths tour guide, who shows American Morrisey-pilgrims around Salford Lads Club and the Southern Cemetery, then nicks their wallets. \"You're so lucky to live here,\" says one tourist. \"I pinch myself daily,\" says Shed. </p> <p>More importantly, Manchester is building up a base of new media and internet start-ups that could in the next two years overtake Bristol as Britain's second e-city. \"The IT scene is vibrant but underestimated, because Manchester keeps its ideas under wraps in case they're stolen,\" says Peter Stewart, who heads the multimillion-pound, four-people firm Root 101. The company went live last week with a trial version of Wilson's new web music venture to sell songs for 33p and give artists a higher cut than traditional sales. Stuart predicts Manchester as the world centre of secure, unhackable servers. Web startups are an example of a new pattern of cultural industry in Manchester. Some 42% of people work in companies of under 10, while 32% are self-employed. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back at Atlas bar, Wilson stops talking when he spots a man in an anorak out in the street gazing towards the Castlefield canals. \"Property developer.

What does Livesey have in mind? Lofts? \"No, a unique innovation, a post office. All these developments and no one's thought of it.\" </p> <p>Outside, back down Deansgate, there are men in anoraks, moving in threes, with golfing brollies, looking at buildings to house the Manchester third wave - when it comes. </p> <p>\u0095 Mancunian, a new work by Paul Housley and a selection from the LS Lowry collection, is showing at the Lowry Centre, Salford, from January 13 to April 22.

The campaign has been created by to drive recruitment to the Navy at a time when it urgently needs 5,000 new recruits.

Or is it caught between a rock and a hard place? </p> <p>Certainly, there is plenty of optimism in euroland.

However, Europe is changing. France's adoption of the 35-hour week has given many firms greater flexibility over working hours and has not harmed job growth. Indeed, unemployment has fallen from 10.7% to 8.9% in France in the past year. </p> <p>Euroland is also likely to benefit from the relative lack of \"irrational exuberance\" in financial markets. Having not risen as high as in the US, share prices in Europe have a shorter distance to fall. Moreover, only 5% of private household wealth in euroland is invested in the stock market compared to 25% in the US so the effect of falling share prices on consumer spending is much more limited. </p> <p>The impact of the falling oil price, down 30% since its peak last September, is another plus for Europe which is much more dependent on oil imports than the US. Lower energy costs will help to boost the profitability of euroland firms, enabling them to compete in global markets. </p> <p>Britain, which does about half of its trade with euroland, will benefit from stronger continental European growth and the strengthening euro, which makes UK exports cheaper. </p> <p>But the extra business may not be enough to offset the impact of a steep downturn in the US. While the UK is no more exposed than anywhere else in Europe to a drop in demand for imports from America, it is intimately connected to the world's biggest economy by a much stronger web of investment ties. As home of the biggest financial centre in Europe, the UK is also uniquely vulnerable to a bear market in financial assets. </p> <p>Attracted by the culture and attractive business environment, US companies like to come here and vice versa. Britain accounts for $183bn (\u00a3120bn), or a fifth, of the total stock of foreign direct investment in the US from which its annual income is currently $12bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, according to research by HSBC. That represents about a third of the UK's total income from foreign direct investment. </p> <p>As well as being the biggest outward investor in the world, the UK is also the most popular place in Europe for inward investment, especially from the US.

Michael Howard was given the same treatment in the 1997 general election when he pleaded with Mr Major to be allowed to highlight his differences with Labour over immigration policy. \"If Labour want to play dirty, let them play dirty. I am not going down that route,\" Mr Major was quoted as saying. He did not mention the issue once during the six week campaign.</p> <p>But this time the gloves are coming off and the Tories recognise that, as Andrew Lansley, their general election campaign strategist, has pointed out, it is an issue that plays particularly well in the tabloids and has the power to hurt Labour.</p> <p>So what of the main claims made by Mr Heseltine? In an article for the Daily Mail, which has been highlighting cases of \"bogus asylum seekers\" almost daily for two months now, the former deputy prime minister summed up his case on the basis of \"three stark conclusions\". The first was that \"a very large number are cheats deliberately making bogus claims and false allegations to get into this country\". In his second charge he claimed that British citizens were being pushed to the back of the queue for housing and hospital treatment by \"dubious asylum seekers\". His final conclusion was that the problem of \"phoney asylum seekers was likely to grow as the impression spread that this country was a soft touch.\"</p> <p>Mr Heseltine's real agenda lay deep in the detail of his Mail article where he made clear that the solution lies in persuading the rest of the European Union, and the United Nations if necessary, to tear up the 1951 Geneva Convention which guarantees the right of an individual fleeing persecution to seek asylum.

      "bodyText": "When even a respected liberal Tory such as Michael Heseltine sounded off this week about \"bogus asylum seekers\" few political commentators were left in any doubt that the Conservatives intend to use this explosive social issue as a key part of their strategy in this year's coming general election. When, as home secretary, Kenneth Baker tried to play the asylum card during the 1992 election he soon found himself slapped down by John Major. Michael Howard was given the same treatment in the 1997 general election when he pleaded with Mr Major to be allowed to highlight his differences with Labour over immigration policy. \"If Labour want to play dirty, let them play dirty. I am not going down that route,\" Mr Major was quoted as saying. He did not mention the issue once during the six week campaign. But this time the gloves are coming off and the Tories recognise that, as Andrew Lansley, their general election campaign strategist, has pointed out, it is an issue that plays particularly well in the tabloids and has the power to hurt Labour. So what of the main claims made by Mr Heseltine? In an article for the Daily Mail, which has been highlighting cases of \"bogus asylum seekers\" almost daily for two months now, the former deputy prime minister summed up his case on the basis of \"three stark conclusions\". The first was that \"a very large number are cheats deliberately making bogus claims and false allegations to get into this country\". In his second charge he claimed that British citizens were being pushed to the back of the queue for housing and hospital treatment by \"dubious asylum seekers\". His final conclusion was that the problem of \"phoney asylum seekers was likely to grow as the impression spread that this country was a soft touch.\" Mr Heseltine's real agenda lay deep in the detail of his Mail article where he made clear that the solution lies in persuading the rest of the European Union, and the United Nations if necessary, to tear up the 1951 Geneva Convention which guarantees the right of an individual fleeing persecution to seek asylum. Instead he wants to \"redefine it for the new millennium\", which is presumably code for ensuring that it is even harder for those fleeing modern day tyrannies, such as Iraq or Iran, to clamber over the walls of Fortress Europe. But to analyse his first charge that most asylum seekers are cheats. It is true that in the last three months the Home Office has turned down 88% of the cases it has decided in the past three months. But that masks the fact that only 48% of those cases were refused after full consideration was given to whether their claim to be suffering from persecution was genuine or unfounded.

America's team effort is working,\" Mr McCaffrey said.</p> <p>In his report, Mr McCaffrey also focused attention on steroid use, particularly by young people of both sexes who wanted \"to get that slightly ripped look, to improve their chance of getting selected [for school sports teams]\".</p> <p>In the past, Mr McCaffrey has been criticised by liberal drugs counsellors and other observers for bringing his military vocabulary to the issue.</p> <p>His use of terms like the \"war on drugs\" has helped to spawn a so-called \"zero tolerance\" culture in American schools, where even such innocuous things as cough lozenges have led to teenagers facing suspension from school.</p> <p>Yesterday, however, Mr McCaffrey was in a more peacetime mode.</p> <p>\"Although wars are expected to end, drug education - like all schooling - is a continuous process,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The moment we believe ourselves victorious and drop our guard, drug abuse will resurface in the next generation. To reduce the demand for drugs, prevention must be ongoing.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "President Clinton's often controversial drugs policy adviser, General Barry McCaffrey, warned yesterday of an \"explosive increase\" in young people's use of the recreational drug ecstasy, after years in which public campaigning against drugs has focused mainly on marijuana, crack cocaine and heroin. In his final annual report before he leaves his job, Mr McCaffrey admitted that America's drugs education and prevention efforts had failed to stem the rising use of ecstasy by the teenagers at whom much of the campaigning was aimed. Ecstasy use, long familiar in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, was relatively uncommon in the US until the late 1990s, when it rapidly became the preferred drug of teenagers of all social classes, not least because of restrictions on teenage access to alcohol. The use of ecstasy, known chemically as methylenedioxy-methamphetamine or MDMA, has been established in eastern US cities for several years but it has now spread rapidly across the whole of the country, Mr McCaffrey said. \"We are seeing an explosive increase in exposure to MDMA among our children. \"They think it's a hug drug, it's a dance-all-night, feel-good drug.\" But in the otherwise upbeat assessment of his years in charge of the Clinton administration's national and international anti-drugs efforts, Mr McCaffrey claimed that he had helped to make \"substantial progress in confronting illegal drug abuse and drug trafficking\", reducing teenage drugs use overall by 21% in the past two years. Official figures, though notoriously difficult to compile, suggest that overall illegal drugs use has declined by half in the past 20 years, alongside steep and steady falls in murder and other forms of crime associated with drugs use and dependency. \"Federal drug policy is succeeding because of the involvement of parents, teachers, coaches, religious leaders, business leaders, law enforcement personnel, and community coalitions who are working hard to protect our children. America's team effort is working,\" Mr McCaffrey said. In his report, Mr McCaffrey also focused attention on steroid use, particularly by young people of both sexes who wanted \"to get that slightly ripped look, to improve their chance of getting selected [for school sports teams]\". In the past, Mr McCaffrey has been criticised by liberal drugs counsellors and other observers for bringing his military vocabulary to the issue. His use of terms like the \"war on drugs\" has helped to spawn a so-called \"zero tolerance\" culture in American schools, where even such innocuous things as cough lozenges have led to teenagers facing suspension from school. Yesterday, however, Mr McCaffrey was in a more peacetime mode. \"Although wars are expected to end, drug education - like all schooling - is a continuous process,\" he said. \"The moment we believe ourselves victorious and drop our guard, drug abuse will resurface in the next generation. To reduce the demand for drugs, prevention must be ongoing.\"",

She roams the Atlantic as far as Greenland, feeds and grows and, if she survives disease and predators, including man, returns to the river, struggles upstream, digs a trench, lays her eggs, waits for a male salmon to fertilise them, and buries them with flicks of her tail.

Reared in fresh water, he is moved to the salt water of a sea loch when he is ready to migrate and spends the rest of his short life swimming in aimless caged circles in a kind of living soup made up of 2% fish and 98% water. Fed a steady diet rich in fish protein, with added axanthin to give his flesh a consumer-friendly pink colour, he is safe from fly fishermen and poachers; if he gets ill, the vet comes and prescribes medicine for the whole cage.

Even now, the way it is often served, tissue-thin smoked slices with dainty triangles of brown bread, as if it was rare as caviar, is a nod to its nob origins. The truth, of course, is that thanks to Scottish fish farming, it's about as rare as bacon. Britain produces 125,000 tonnes of farmed salmon a year, against a couple of hundred tons of the wild stuff. Just in time. With wild sea fish such as cod turning from staples to delicacies, farmed salmon - healthy, locally produced and cheap - is well placed to fill a niche in the national diet.</p> <p>Which is why the latest revival of long-standing concerns about pollutants in farmed fish has caused such a stir. A scientist at the University of Surrey in Guildford, Miriam Jacobs, has come up with evidence that the kind of salmon on sale in Britain today contains levels of man-made toxins which could be dangerous, particularly for young children.</p> <p>Pre-publicity for a BBC documentary featuring her findings this weekend exaggerated her results, triggering a furious reaction from Scottish salmon producers and the Food Standards Agency, which insists that salmon is safe.

The World Health Organisation's recommended maximum daily intake of PCBs is 1 to 4 picograms per kilogramme of bodyweight.

There would be far fewer refugees, since there would be fewer wars, fewer tyrannical states and better preparations against natural disasters. There would be less \"economic\" migration, since the differentials in income and circumstance would be smaller. If there is anything that has been established pretty much beyond doubt in studies of migration it is that the vast majority of people prefer to stay at home. The sociologist Saskia Sassen, who has examined these matters with great insight, has shown that when they do leave home, there have to be very compelling reasons, special opportunities or established habits or some combination of these three. When they nevertheless do leave, they prefer to do so on a temporary basis, returning periodically, often very frequently, to the old country. And if they do leave home permanently, they quite often change their mind and go back in the end, as did two thirds of the Italians who emigrated to the US at the turn of the century.</p> <p>Does migration show, then, that something is wrong, since it so often involves people doing what they do not really want to do? Not always or necessarily, because there appears, historically, to have been no way of achieving economic growth without creating imbalances and inequalities between countries and regions.

The same process eventually took place in the European Union as a whole, when countries which sent out large numbers of labour migrants as recently as 30 years ago, such as Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland, ceased to do so as their circumstances improved, an improvement aided by their membership of the union. Now that they are completely free to live anywhere in Europe, Europeans no longer move to any great extent: of the 344m citizens of the EU, only 5m work in a country which is not their country of birth.</p> <p>Even the new Europeans who will be joining in the next few years, although somewhat poorer than those in the present member states, are not expected to move in large numbers. A recent Chatham House study estimates that the numbers who will move from Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia after accession will be relatively small, with a maximum of less than 3m over 15 years, who will mainly either commute or move only temporarily. And the numbers will decline after differentials even up.</p> <p>The effects on the receiving countries are likely to be an overall net economic gain with the possibility of a slight increase in unemployment and slight downward pressure on wages. Why, in the face of projections like these, is Chancellor Schr\u00f6der angering central European governments by insisting on his seven years? Is it simply that the popular perception of an impending migrant flood cannot be shifted, however often the facts are laid out? Is it that migrants are disproportionately concentrated in particular places?

They are comparable, too, in that new systems are always emerging and old ones dying out. Particular migrations, each with a specific history, come to an end, new ones begin. They are like the weather in that there is a persistent tendency to overestimate the size and duration of storms.

      "body": "<p>It promises to be a gruelling test of mind and body that could lead to two transatlantic rowing records being smashed at the same time.</p> <p>On their odyssey from Canada to the Isles of Scilly, British rowers Mark Stubbs, Mark Phillips, Mark Woods and Steve King will face a number of hazards including towering waves, giant icebergs, freezing conditions, and perhaps the boat itself.</p> <p>In the clearest indication to date that adventurers and seamen whose boats snap in half are bowed but never broken, Britain's latest attempt to challenge the transatlantic rowing record is being orchestrated by Pete Goss, the man who launched Team Phillips, the world's most advanced and costliest catamaran, last year and lost it last month.</p> <p>The doomed Team Phillips, which Goss claimed at its launch would be the fastest in the world, was lost in a storm in the Atlantic as it made its way to the start of a round-the-world race. A few weeks after its launch the 45ft bow of the \u00a34m catamaran snapped during sea trials.</p> <p>Members of Goss's latest record-seeking expedition will set sail in Atlantic Spirit, which has been dubbed the world's most advanced rowing boat.</p> <p>The transatlantic challenge, which takes place this summer, is titled the Goss Atlantic Row. The Atlantic Spirit has been built using the same technology and carbon fibre material as Team Phillips. All involved are hoping that is where any similarity will end.</p> <p>\"I don't think this is my last chance,\" said Goss yesterday at the launch of Atlantic Spirit on the first day of the London Boat Show. \"Team Phillips was a success story in many ways. Unfortunately, we became caught in a freak storm and I was not prepared to risk the lives of my crew. That is why we decided to abandon the vessel.</p> <p>\"I was very sad when I lost Team Phillips. I am an adventurer and if you go into these challenges then you have to accept some of the consequences. I certainly do not think it was a failure and I have not been beaten.\"</p> <p>Team Phillips was launched by the Queen last March and heralded as the world's most sophisticated ocean racer. Adrian Thompson, designer of the catamaran, also designed Atlantic Row and both vessels have been constructed at Goss's headquarters at Totnes, Devon.</p> <p>Atlantic Spirit member Mark Phillips, 39, said: \"There was a lot of concern from our families following what happened to Team Phillips. But we have to assure them that we will be safe.</p> <p>\"People have been coming up to us and saying that we must be mad going in a Pete Goss boat. But we should not lose sight of all the things that Adrian Thompson and Goss have achieved. It's all about the design of the boat and we are confident that we will be safe and stay afloat.\"</p> <p>The crew of four aim to break two records; the Atlantic rowing record, held by 11 Frenchmen at 35 days, and the record across the Atlantic from west to east which stands at 55 days.</p> <p>Goss, 39, is a former Royal Marine who was awarded France's highest honour for rescuing a French sailor in a single-handed round the world yacht race. He estimates that his expedition members will be able to complete the west to east crossing in 32 days.</p> <p>According to the Goss camp's blurb, the Atlantic Spirit, like Team Phillips, has been designed to ensure that it \"concentrates on maximising strength to weight ratios, and creating an aero-dynamic and frictionless vessel\".</p> <p>Goss is confident his boat will sail victoriously into his Devon headquarters 32 days after it sets sail from Canada.</p> <p>The Atlantic Spirit's total weight of 220 kgs, half the weight of the four crew, is being cited as one of the main reasons for its possible success.</p> <p>Goss said: \"We have a fantastic team and a boat that has been built using advanced concepts. I would not say that we are going to fail this time and I am confident that we can do it. We might have had a setback with Team Phillips but we have brave hearts.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It promises to be a gruelling test of mind and body that could lead to two transatlantic rowing records being smashed at the same time. On their odyssey from Canada to the Isles of Scilly, British rowers Mark Stubbs, Mark Phillips, Mark Woods and Steve King will face a number of hazards including towering waves, giant icebergs, freezing conditions, and perhaps the boat itself. In the clearest indication to date that adventurers and seamen whose boats snap in half are bowed but never broken, Britain's latest attempt to challenge the transatlantic rowing record is being orchestrated by Pete Goss, the man who launched Team Phillips, the world's most advanced and costliest catamaran, last year and lost it last month. The doomed Team Phillips, which Goss claimed at its launch would be the fastest in the world, was lost in a storm in the Atlantic as it made its way to the start of a round-the-world race. A few weeks after its launch the 45ft bow of the \u00a34m catamaran snapped during sea trials. Members of Goss's latest record-seeking expedition will set sail in Atlantic Spirit, which has been dubbed the world's most advanced rowing boat. The transatlantic challenge, which takes place this summer, is titled the Goss Atlantic Row. The Atlantic Spirit has been built using the same technology and carbon fibre material as Team Phillips. All involved are hoping that is where any similarity will end. \"I don't think this is my last chance,\" said Goss yesterday at the launch of Atlantic Spirit on the first day of the London Boat Show. \"Team Phillips was a success story in many ways. Unfortunately, we became caught in a freak storm and I was not prepared to risk the lives of my crew. That is why we decided to abandon the vessel. \"I was very sad when I lost Team Phillips. I am an adventurer and if you go into these challenges then you have to accept some of the consequences. I certainly do not think it was a failure and I have not been beaten.\" Team Phillips was launched by the Queen last March and heralded as the world's most sophisticated ocean racer. Adrian Thompson, designer of the catamaran, also designed Atlantic Row and both vessels have been constructed at Goss's headquarters at Totnes, Devon. Atlantic Spirit member Mark Phillips, 39, said: \"There was a lot of concern from our families following what happened to Team Phillips. But we have to assure them that we will be safe. \"People have been coming up to us and saying that we must be mad going in a Pete Goss boat. But we should not lose sight of all the things that Adrian Thompson and Goss have achieved. It's all about the design of the boat and we are confident that we will be safe and stay afloat.\" The crew of four aim to break two records; the Atlantic rowing record, held by 11 Frenchmen at 35 days, and the record across the Atlantic from west to east which stands at 55 days. Goss, 39, is a former Royal Marine who was awarded France's highest honour for rescuing a French sailor in a single-handed round the world yacht race. He estimates that his expedition members will be able to complete the west to east crossing in 32 days. According to the Goss camp's blurb, the Atlantic Spirit, like Team Phillips, has been designed to ensure that it \"concentrates on maximising strength to weight ratios, and creating an aero-dynamic and frictionless vessel\". Goss is confident his boat will sail victoriously into his Devon headquarters 32 days after it sets sail from Canada. The Atlantic Spirit's total weight of 220 kgs, half the weight of the four crew, is being cited as one of the main reasons for its possible success. Goss said: \"We have a fantastic team and a boat that has been built using advanced concepts. I would not say that we are going to fail this time and I am confident that we can do it. We might have had a setback with Team Phillips but we have brave hearts.\"",

At a stroke, Hugh Richardson, who has died aged 94, became Britain's last representative to an independent Tibet and the first from India. But while the mission continued seamlessly with the same staff, the world of central Asian politics was changing fast, something that Richardson, the finest Tibetan scholar of his era, pointed out in dispatches to both his British and Indian masters.</p> <p>\"We ignored Tibet,\" said India's prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, but the Chinese did not. If the new republic failed to understand the threat on its northern border, Richardson could see China coming. He left Tibet for good in 1950, a few months before the Chinese overran Lhasa. He was called \"a vicious aggressor\" by Chinese propagandists, though, in truth, few men were less vicious or aggressive.</p> <p>In fact, Richardson's greatest threat to the Chinese was his objective observation of the labyrinthine world of Tibetan politics and his deep understanding of Tibetan culture. When he argued that Tibet had been an independent state before its occupation by the Chinese, he did so with immense authority.</p> <p>An army officer's son, he was born at St Andrews, Fife. His elder brother, Frank, followed their father into the military, also as a doctor, while Hugh won a scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, to read greats, the subject chosen by his predecessors in Tibet, Sir Charles Bell and Sir Basil Gould, both great Tibetologists whom Richardson would eventually surpass.</p> <p>After briefly teaching at his old school, Trinity College at Glenalmond, Richardson sat the Indian civil service exam. He learned to speak Bengali fluently, a skill that later helped him to befriend the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore. His first posting, to Tamluk, in modern Bangla- desh, also drew on his Bengali skills, and from there he crossed the border from Sikkim into Tibet, travelling as far as Phari in 1933 with his Tibetan servant Pema.</p> <p>But it was during his next posting, to Baluchistan, that Richardson's interest in Tibet blossomed. Left with almost nothing to do, he indulged his passion for gardening and got to know his colleague Basil Gould, the former agent in Sikkim who, in 1936, recruited Richardson as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to join a new mission to Lhasa. The pretext was to mediate for the return from exile in China of the Panchen Lama, but Gould was determined to counter increasing Chinese influence by establishing a permanent British presence. This he achieved, leaving Richardson in charge when he left.</p> <p>Richardson spent eight of the next 15 years in Tibet, from 1936 to 1940, when he returned to India for the remainder of the war, and from 1946 to 1950, latterly for the Indian government. He learned to speak Tibetan fluently, his accent described by the Tibetan politician Tsipon Shakabpa as \"impeccable Lhasa Tibetan with a slight Oxford accent\". He witnessed astonishing times in Lhasa, including the arrival of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama in 1936, and the unwelcome expedition of 1939, led by Ernst Schaefer, which had been dispatched by Himmler to prove the Tibetans were a lost Aryan race.</p> <p>Such intrusions did not, however, dispel the magic of the place. \"A party at Lhasa,\" Richardson later recalled, \"could last from 10 in the morning to 10 at night and could go on for two days.\" He made his own contributions to the fun, introducing golf - the thin air being useful for long drives - and soccer.</p> <p>Although he missed the Dalai Lama's installation, Richardson kept in touch with the Tibetan leader after the war - through the Austrian mountaineers, Heinrich Harrer and Peter Aufschnaiter, when protocol prevented private interviews, and, after 1959, more personally during the Dalai Lama's continuing exile. He continued to lobby the United Nations to oppose the Chinese invasion and described himself \"ashamed\" when the British abstained.</p> <p>After leaving Tibet, he returned to St Andrews, where he remained until his death, a cherished member of the Royal and Ancient. He began a second career as a scholar on Tibetan culture and politics, and wrote prodigiously, co-authoring a cultural history of the country with David Snellgrove and writing papers and monographs, expertly collected by the Himalayan scholar Michael Aris in 1998 as High Peaks, Pure Earth. Subjects range from the origins of the Tibetan state to early Tibetan law on dog bites, something anyone who has travelled in Tibet will appreciate.</p> <p>Richardson's work, encapsulated in this book, fills important gaps in the historical record, as well as bearing witness to a culture that has been systematically dest- royed over the last 50 years. At the time of his memorial service in St Andrews, monks lit butter lamps in the Jokhang in Lhasa, and the Dalai Lama sent a personal message praising Richardson as \"an honorary Tibetan\".</p> <p>In 1951, Richardson married Huldah Rennie, whose first husband had been killed during the war, and became stepfather to her children, David and Elizabeth. She predeceased him in 1995.</p> <p>\u0095 Hugh Edward Richardson, diplomat and author, born December 22 1905; died December 3 2000</p>",

When he argued that Tibet had been an independent state before its occupation by the Chinese, he did so with immense authority. An army officer's son, he was born at St Andrews, Fife. His elder brother, Frank, followed their father into the military, also as a doctor, while Hugh won a scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, to read greats, the subject chosen by his predecessors in Tibet, Sir Charles Bell and Sir Basil Gould, both great Tibetologists whom Richardson would eventually surpass. After briefly teaching at his old school, Trinity College at Glenalmond, Richardson sat the Indian civil service exam. He learned to speak Bengali fluently, a skill that later helped him to befriend the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore. His first posting, to Tamluk, in modern Bangla- desh, also drew on his Bengali skills, and from there he crossed the border from Sikkim into Tibet, travelling as far as Phari in 1933 with his Tibetan servant Pema. But it was during his next posting, to Baluchistan, that Richardson's interest in Tibet blossomed. Left with almost nothing to do, he indulged his passion for gardening and got to know his colleague Basil Gould, the former agent in Sikkim who, in 1936, recruited Richardson as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to join a new mission to Lhasa. The pretext was to mediate for the return from exile in China of the Panchen Lama, but Gould was determined to counter increasing Chinese influence by establishing a permanent British presence. This he achieved, leaving Richardson in charge when he left. Richardson spent eight of the next 15 years in Tibet, from 1936 to 1940, when he returned to India for the remainder of the war, and from 1946 to 1950, latterly for the Indian government. He learned to speak Tibetan fluently, his accent described by the Tibetan politician Tsipon Shakabpa as \"impeccable Lhasa Tibetan with a slight Oxford accent\". He witnessed astonishing times in Lhasa, including the arrival of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama in 1936, and the unwelcome expedition of 1939, led by Ernst Schaefer, which had been dispatched by Himmler to prove the Tibetans were a lost Aryan race. Such intrusions did not, however, dispel the magic of the place. \"A party at Lhasa,\" Richardson later recalled, \"could last from 10 in the morning to 10 at night and could go on for two days.\" He made his own contributions to the fun, introducing golf - the thin air being useful for long drives - and soccer. Although he missed the Dalai Lama's installation, Richardson kept in touch with the Tibetan leader after the war - through the Austrian mountaineers, Heinrich Harrer and Peter Aufschnaiter, when protocol prevented private interviews, and, after 1959, more personally during the Dalai Lama's continuing exile. He continued to lobby the United Nations to oppose the Chinese invasion and described himself \"ashamed\" when the British abstained. After leaving Tibet, he returned to St Andrews, where he remained until his death, a cherished member of the Royal and Ancient. He began a second career as a scholar on Tibetan culture and politics, and wrote prodigiously, co-authoring a cultural history of the country with David Snellgrove and writing papers and monographs, expertly collected by the Himalayan scholar Michael Aris in 1998 as High Peaks, Pure Earth. Subjects range from the origins of the Tibetan state to early Tibetan law on dog bites, something anyone who has travelled in Tibet will appreciate. Richardson's work, encapsulated in this book, fills important gaps in the historical record, as well as bearing witness to a culture that has been systematically dest- royed over the last 50 years. At the time of his memorial service in St Andrews, monks lit butter lamps in the Jokhang in Lhasa, and the Dalai Lama sent a personal message praising Richardson as \"an honorary Tibetan\". In 1951, Richardson married Huldah Rennie, whose first husband had been killed during the war, and became stepfather to her children, David and Elizabeth. She predeceased him in 1995. \u0095 Hugh Edward Richardson, diplomat and author, born December 22 1905; died December 3 2000",

The National Portrait Gallery's new wing in central London is named after Mr Ondaatje, the older brother of Michael Ondaatje, an award-winning novelist. The shift from dependency on the trade unions and party rank and file to the successful courtship of wealthy philanthropists is seen by MPs and party activists as representing a significant change in Britain's political culture. The cash will go into a general fund and Millbank described \u00a36m from three men as small beer compared to its \u00a325m annual budget. But it is nearly half what Labour will be allowed to spend at the coming election - a cap is expected to be set at around \u00a315m. Last night's news means Labour has almost certainly reached that target. Veteran Labour MP Tony Benn called it \"a negation of democracy\" while the Conservatives brazenly denounced \"Labour's continuing reliance on a small number of very large donors\" - precisely its own position for many years. The Liberal Democrats again called for state funding of politics to stop sleaze and prevent governments being \"in thrall to big corporations\". To rub salt into Conservative wounds, Mr Ondaatje was revealed as a former Tory donor who had become disillusioned with the party's anti-European stance. \"They [Labour] are doing a very good job [with the economy] at a difficult time and I believe they should be given every possible support,\" Mr Ondaatje said. A Conservative victory at the election would be a disaster, he added. Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, has already donated millions to Labour and before that to the SDP, which was also backed for a period by Lord Hamlyn. Last night Lord Sainsbury said he was announcing his latest gift of \u00a32m to head off speculation. \"In our democracy, political parties have to raise funds to campaign and put their policies to the electorate, and as a proud supporter of the Labour Party I am happy that I am in a position where I can make a contribution,\" he said. Last night Labour spin doctors insisted that the party retained the broadest fundraising base in Britain with 40% of its income coming from party members and small donors (below \u00a35,000), 30% from the unions, 10% from sales and merchandising and 20% from big donors. Lord Levy, the prime minister's personal fundraiser and envoy, is believed to have played a brokering role - although Chris Smith, the culture secretary, is admired by Mr Ondaatje and may have smoothed his path. Labour's spokesman, Lance Price, said: \"What we did feel after Lord Hamlyn made the statement he did on Tuesday, that it was right and proper, just to ensure that there was no confusion whatever, that other donors in that league, that we should at least contact them and see how they would feel about having their names made public as well.\" Andrew Lansley, a senior Tory MP, complained: \"This news of Labour's continuing reliance on a small number of very large donors, alongside the trade unions, for its financial backing highlights strongly the need for a broader base of party funding.\" A Labour backbencher, Andrew Mackinlay, last night called for all large donors to be barred from receiving a peerage. The Thurrock MP said: \"There should be a ceiling on all large individual and corporate donations. All donors to political parties should be disqualified from being nominated for membership of the House of Lords by any party leader. \"Disqualification should exist for at least five years following the last donation,\" he added.

      "bodyText": "Russian military commanders dismissed American claims yesterday that the Kremlin had covertly deployed short-range nuclear weapons in eastern Europe for the first time since the end of the cold war. According to American intelligence leaks, the Russians have been moving tactical nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad on the Baltic in the past year. The action would be in line with President Vladimir Putin's new military doctrine, which raises Russia's nuclear threshold to compensate for the sorry state of its conventional forces. Sources in the Russian armed forces general staff rejected the US allegation. \"The information has nothing in common with reality and has the character of a provocation,\" a source said. But the US state department said Washington would raise the issue with the Russians soon. The secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, is expected to have her final meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, in the next fortnight before being replaced by General Colin Powell. The departmental spokesman Richard Boucher said: \"It's an issue we want to take up.\" Kaliningrad, Germany's former east Prussian fortress of K\u00f6nigsberg, is Russia's strategically vital window on the west and home to its Baltic fleet. The Soviet Union's collapse and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact left Kaliningrad cut off from Russia, sandwiched between Poland, now a Nato member, and Lithuania, a prospective member. Moscow's denial was buttressed by senior Lithuanian officials, who said they had no evidence to support the US report, nor had they monitored shipments of nuclear weapons on the Russian military routes into Kaliningrad. The foreign minister in Vilnius, Antanas Valionis, played down the report. But the Polish defence minister, Bronislaw Komorowski, called for international inspectors to verify Moscow's claim that it had not deployed nuclear weapons. \"Poland needs to monitor the situation in Kaliningrad on a day-to-day basis and it is doing that,\" he said on the Polish public television station Channel One. \"Verification will include pushing for international inspection, which is a usual thing,\" he said. US intelligence and military officials told journalists in Washington that Moscow had moved battlefield nuclear weapons, possibly warheads for the SS-21 Tochka missile, into Kaliningrad in June, within weeks of Mr Putin endorsing Russia's new military doctrine. In April, in one of the first acts of his presidency, he blessed a doctrine which foresees first and earlier use of nuclear weapons to forestall conventional attacks on Russia. Western and Russian analysts agree that Moscow has become more dependent on its vast nuclear arsenal because of the dire condition and poor morale of its armed forces. The accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to Nato in 1999 brought renewed hostility between Moscow and the western alliance, exacerbated by Nato's war in Kosovo the same year. But it remains unclear whether tactical nuclear missiles are being moved to the Kaliningrad enclave or have been stored there for years. In non-binding agreements with Washington in 1991 and 1992, the Kremlin committed itself to withdrawing all short-range nuclear weapons from eastern Europe and keeping the Baltic nuclear free. It said the missiles were withdrawn and placed in storage in Russia. Some of these stores could be in Kaliningrad, and the missiles there could have been taken from Baltic fleet ships. Yesterday's Russian denial of the American report left open the possibility that the weapons are being stored in the enclave. Hawkish American politicians voiced alarm at the report and said they showed the need for the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to be taken under the shelter of the Nato umbrella. Any serious move by the new US administration to bring them into Nato would precipitate a bigger crisis in Russia's relations with the west. But if the nuclear deployment is confirmed, that could cause a rift between western Europe and the US on security strategy, and set Germany against further Nato expansion. In the past two months Moscow has been applauding western European moves towards a security strategy more independent of Nato and Washington, seeking to exploit transatlantic tension regarding the new European rapid-reaction force.",

This is the work of the mother, with whom I lived briefly when my daughter was born. I cared for my daughter daily until school age, when the mother said she felt my presence would prevent her finding a partner. She then disrupted my contact with my daughter and, in spite of court orders, alienated my daughter so that she stopped contacting anyone in touch with me. My choices seem to be: (a) ignore the lawyer's letter and continue to send gifts; (b) stop contacting my daughter in the hope that she will soon leave the mother and see the situation differently; (c) force the matter to court to make my daughter aware that she has been alienated for her mother's ends.</p> <p><b> Do as much as you can</b><br></p> <p>I was moved by your letter; well done to know the three options; my suggestion is do all three, but with steadfastness and integrity.

      "bodyText": "Nato should dispose of large fragments of depleted uranium (DU) ammunition remaining in Kosovo 18 months after the conflict ended, because they represent an unnecessary risk to health, a UN study says. Further details of the preliminary results of the UN Environment Programme investigation emerged yesterday as the EU began an inquiry into whether there is a link between radioactive military debris and the death from cancer of soldiers who served in the Balkans. Meanwhile, the European commission president, Romano Prodi, called for DU-coated shells to be banned, after the French defence ministry said that four French soldiers who served in the Balkans during Nato's bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 were being treated for leukaemia in a military hospital. \"It is clear that if there is even a minimal risk, these arms must be abolished,\" he said. \"And even if this risk was not there, I don't like the idea of using these particular weapons\". Britain remains one of the few countries to resist compulsory screening of troops returning from Kosovo for traces of contamination. The ministry of defence insisted that in its solid form was not a health hazard. \"The UN's initial findings were that there were a lot of other things which were of far greater concern,\" a spokesman said. Italy opened an inquiry last week into a possible link between DU and 30 cases of serious illness in troops who served in the area, 12 of whom developed cancer. Five have already died of leukaemia. The Campaign Against Depleted Uranium in Manchester says that most of the areas where DU shells were dropped during the Kosovo war are in the south, in the Italian sector. Spain said it would examine all the 32,000 soldiers who have served in the Balkans since 1992. Portugal, Finland, Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece also plan to screen their peacekeepers and check radiation levels to discover if there is such a condition as \"Balkans syndrome\". The biologist leading the Royal Society's inquiry into the long-term effects of DU weapons, Professor Brian Spratt of Oxford University, called on the government to test British troops. \"The leukaemia cases are probably not related, but the health of soldiers who go out to fight for their country should be taken seriously,\" he said. In its preliminary statement, the UN said it had found \"slightly higher\" radioactivity in Kosovo at eight of the 11 sites examined last November. Nato had given details of 112 sites where an estimated 31,000 rounds of armour-piercing DU ammunition were used during attacks on Serb targets. A US army officer on the team, who helped develop DU ammunition, was apparently surprised to find that it had not vapourised or dispersed. The UN statement said that its scientists had found \"either slightly higher amounts of Beta-radiation, specifically at or around the holes left by DU ammunition, or remnants of ammunitions, such as sabots and penetrators\". The team collected seven DU outer casings and seven penetrators. \"It is an extra risk for the population, and that is something that military experts were surprised to find,\" Pekka Haavisto, the Finnish head of the mission, said yesterday. There is also concern about mine clearance, because most DU was found in heavily mined areas or sites with unexploded ordinance - some of which is cleared by controlled explosions. The UN believes this can turn DU back into its most dangerous form - a dust that can be inhaled. What is depleted uranium? Tim Radford, science editor Natural uranium is a mix of different isotopes, including a small proportion of very radioactive U-235. The proportion of U-235 is concentrated for atomic fuel rods, and what is left over is depleted U-238. This has a radioactive half life of 4.5bn years, that is, it would take roughly the lifetime of the solar system for half of a lump of U-238 to break down into something else. It remains, however, radioactive. \"In contact, you could get quite a sizeable dose [of radiation], but a few inches away, it's gone,\" Michael Clark of Britain's National Radiological Protection Board said. The rays from depleted uranium, or DU, may not be particularly penetrating but the substance itself is one of the densest metals available. It is therefore desirable as a military shell casing. Its density enhances military firepower. Tungsten splinters when it hits the hard steel of a tank; DU penetrates and catches fire, which makes it a perfect weapon for armour-piercing shells.

The connection was observed among the survivors of the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki more than 50 years ago. Because DU ignites on impact, it leaves behind clouds of potentially toxic uranium oxide dust. The fear is this dust could lodge in the lungs and be hazardous. But scientists aren't so sure. \"The calculations show that you would have to inhale almost choking amounts to get appreciable lung dust,\" said Dr Clark. \"You would see kidney problems due to its chemical action before you saw any radiation problems.\"",

Moreover, he has cleverly linked the violent children with the disabled and those with specific learning difficulties so that any complaint about their presence in the classroom can be used to label the plaintive as uncaring, unprofessional, politically incorrect and whatever other shallow label can be found.</p> <p>I have seen this from the perspective of a parent, with my son's education being disrupted by a violent classmate for the past six years, and as a head of department, with more of my time being taken up not by teaching and preparation, but by managing aberrant behaviour and filling out the endless and utterly futile avalanche of paperwork caused by the disruptives. Inclusion, combined with the threat of inspection if suspensions exceed a government guideline, means quite simply that disruptive students can get away with more and more and we are protected less and less. This situation has been created by the government to save money.</p> <p>Each new intake includes more and more students whose behaviour is deemed worthy of \"special attention\". In managing my department I am denied specialist teachers as they are required for teaching personal and social education; soon, no doubt, they will also be required for teaching citizenship.

      "bodyText": "Mr Blunkett has done everything to ensure not only that classroom violence takes place, but that it disrupts the education of as many non-violent children as possible (\u00a3174m to improve classroom discipline, January 3). Moreover, he has cleverly linked the violent children with the disabled and those with specific learning difficulties so that any complaint about their presence in the classroom can be used to label the plaintive as uncaring, unprofessional, politically incorrect and whatever other shallow label can be found. I have seen this from the perspective of a parent, with my son's education being disrupted by a violent classmate for the past six years, and as a head of department, with more of my time being taken up not by teaching and preparation, but by managing aberrant behaviour and filling out the endless and utterly futile avalanche of paperwork caused by the disruptives. Inclusion, combined with the threat of inspection if suspensions exceed a government guideline, means quite simply that disruptive students can get away with more and more and we are protected less and less. This situation has been created by the government to save money. Each new intake includes more and more students whose behaviour is deemed worthy of \"special attention\". In managing my department I am denied specialist teachers as they are required for teaching personal and social education; soon, no doubt, they will also be required for teaching citizenship. Senior management is reduced to Churchillian exhortation rather than professional guidance in efforts to maintain morale. Name and address supplied \u0095 Finding truants and taking them back to school might save some from a life of unemployment and worse. Preventing disaffection in primary school will do a lot more - 10% of children have exceptional difficulties learning to read. There are teachers with qualifications in specific learning difficulties, if the schools employed them. The political will to provide for all does not exist. Stopping children having their self-esteem destroyed in primary school must be the priority. Lillemor Clark (Mother of two dyslexics) London Clarksissc@aol.com",

      "body": "<p>Britain's landlords are raising a glass to trade secretary Stephen Byers after his unexpected intervention to prevent the Belgian firm Interbrew from dominating the country's beer supply. \"If Mr Byers came into my pub, I'd give him a free drink and a meal to go with it,\" said Gary McClure, landlord of the Old King's Head in Barrow-in-Furness. </p> <p>Mr McClure, like many pub managers, was concerned that if Interbrew were allowed to keep the brewing operations of both Whitbread and Bass, it would pay little attention to the needs of individual pubs. He pointed out that few local boozers could boycott a supplier which controlled 78 brands, including Carling, Stella Artois, Tennent's, Worthington and Flowers: \"They carry such a large range of beers that we'd have had no choice - we'd have been tied to whatever prices they stipulated.\" </p> <p>Richard Leith, manager of the Union Rooms, a JD Wetherspoon outlet in Newcastle, agrees: \"They'd have been able to charge what they like - it's scary. And what happens when their level of service falls? There's nothing you can do.\" </p> <p>Interbrew's claim that it would \"nurture local brands\" simply does not wash with seasoned pub operators. Mr Leith says: \"It would have diluted the English pub concept, whereby you can go into ten pubs and get ten different beers. They'd have standardised everything and when you standardise, you lose something.\" </p> <p>Mr Byers's order that Interbrew sell Bass's brewing operations in Britain has left the Belgian company with a hangover of epic proportions. The total cost of the transaction is believed to be approaching \u00a3100m, and the company is likely to make a loss of well over \u00a3500m on selling the assets, which it bought just a few months ago for \u00a32.3bn. So how did the world's second biggest brewer misjudge the mood of the authorities so badly? </p> <p>Initially, Interbrew's argument was quite simple. It pointed out that in comparison with the rest of Europe, the British beer industry remains highly competitive, even if Interbrew and Scottish &amp; Newcastle could each boast a market share of well over 30%. </p> <p>The firm's chief executive, Hugo Powell, is fond of rattling off a list of countries in which one brewer is dominant - France, the biggest brewer has 40%, the leading player in Greece has 82% and in Denmark, Carlsberg-Tetley has 71%. </p> <p>This may have swayed regulators in Brussels but it became largely irrelevant in August, when Mr Byers exercised his right to \"repatriate\" the investigation to Britain's competition commission. </p> <p>Interbrew then changed tack, saying that although a handful of players dominated the British beer market, smaller competitors were gaining ground - citing the strong performance of regional beers such as London Pride and Old Speckled Hen. </p> <p>This was blown out of the water by Carlsberg-Tetley, the third biggest beer supplier in Britain, which declared to the commission that \"if the merger were to proceed, it could not survive as an independent brewer in the UK\". Smaller brewers rely on the big players to distribute their beers, but the commission pointed out that there was no incentive for the likes of Interbrew to promote third-party products. </p> <p>Interbrew's hopes now rest on the possibility of seeking a judicial review, although no one has ever succeeded in over turning a competition ruling in this way. The company's advisers say the commission came up with no solid evidence to suggest that Interbrew and Scottish &amp; Newcastle could, or would, collude over pricing. One adviser said: \"There are clearly some inconsistent and pretty ill-thought through arguments. How do they get to the conclusion that there will be a duopoly? It's all based on circumstantial evidence.\" </p> <p>However, the chances of success are minimal - competition lawyer Tim Frazer of Arnold &amp; Porter says: \"They would have to come up with some very solid arguments to demonstrate that the decision was unreasonable. It's a long shot.\" In the meantime, the vultures are gathering - Heineken, South African Breweries and Anheuser Busch are all running their slide rules over Bass. Another fierce battle is looming for Britain's most popular beers.</p>",

And what happens when their level of service falls? There's nothing you can do.\" Interbrew's claim that it would \"nurture local brands\" simply does not wash with seasoned pub operators. Mr Leith says: \"It would have diluted the English pub concept, whereby you can go into ten pubs and get ten different beers. They'd have standardised everything and when you standardise, you lose something.\" Mr Byers's order that Interbrew sell Bass's brewing operations in Britain has left the Belgian company with a hangover of epic proportions. The total cost of the transaction is believed to be approaching \u00a3100m, and the company is likely to make a loss of well over \u00a3500m on selling the assets, which it bought just a few months ago for \u00a32.3bn. So how did the world's second biggest brewer misjudge the mood of the authorities so badly? Initially, Interbrew's argument was quite simple. It pointed out that in comparison with the rest of Europe, the British beer industry remains highly competitive, even if Interbrew and Scottish &amp; Newcastle could each boast a market share of well over 30%. The firm's chief executive, Hugo Powell, is fond of rattling off a list of countries in which one brewer is dominant - France, the biggest brewer has 40%, the leading player in Greece has 82% and in Denmark, Carlsberg-Tetley has 71%. This may have swayed regulators in Brussels but it became largely irrelevant in August, when Mr Byers exercised his right to \"repatriate\" the investigation to Britain's competition commission. Interbrew then changed tack, saying that although a handful of players dominated the British beer market, smaller competitors were gaining ground - citing the strong performance of regional beers such as London Pride and Old Speckled Hen. This was blown out of the water by Carlsberg-Tetley, the third biggest beer supplier in Britain, which declared to the commission that \"if the merger were to proceed, it could not survive as an independent brewer in the UK\". Smaller brewers rely on the big players to distribute their beers, but the commission pointed out that there was no incentive for the likes of Interbrew to promote third-party products. Interbrew's hopes now rest on the possibility of seeking a judicial review, although no one has ever succeeded in over turning a competition ruling in this way. The company's advisers say the commission came up with no solid evidence to suggest that Interbrew and Scottish &amp; Newcastle could, or would, collude over pricing. One adviser said: \"There are clearly some inconsistent and pretty ill-thought through arguments. How do they get to the conclusion that there will be a duopoly? It's all based on circumstantial evidence.\" However, the chances of success are minimal - competition lawyer Tim Frazer of Arnold &amp; Porter says: \"They would have to come up with some very solid arguments to demonstrate that the decision was unreasonable. It's a long shot.\" In the meantime, the vultures are gathering - Heineken, South African Breweries and Anheuser Busch are all running their slide rules over Bass. Another fierce battle is looming for Britain's most popular beers.",

This is never a safe sort of thing to do, as the grave-robbers are waiting. <strong> The Joy of Sex</strong> (Channel 4) was, however, unexpectedly light-hearted and loving. Which was very much in tune with his book.

Not, perhaps, the most flattering request, but charmingly bookish. </p> <p>The sketches proved absolutely necessary (\"Alex was suggesting things we had never seen before\") and presented a problem for the illustrators, Charles Raymond and Chris Foss. They trawled magazines. They hired Soho models. Comfort brought in Polaroids of his cavortings with Jane. Finally and secretly, Charles Raymond (\"I was the bearded man!\") offered to demonstrate more than 100 explicit sexual positions with his wife, Edeltraud, while Chris Foss photographed them. They were a good-looking couple - if, in Charles's case, a touch furry. </p> <p>Chris takes up the commentary. \"Edeltraud was very Germanic and 'Right, Charles, we start now. Position number one!' She'd tap her leg and say 'Come on, Charles!' and off they would go and do that and she would tick it off and say 'Right Charles, now we do this one!'\" It was the icy winter of the miners' strike. The lights would suddenly go off but Charles and Edeltraud were generating their own electricity. Chris said \"Poor old Charlie was only human, so every now and then he - how do I say it - blew it a bit. I'd say 'Charlie, you can't do it now. We've got 15 more positions and just an hour left. Charlie, can you get back into business as quick as you can?'\" </p> <p>Poor old Charlie became a sexual icon. And, incidentally, the inspiration for Harry Hill's Hairy Man: \"Tonight, Harry, I will attempt the most dangerous sexual position known to man!\" </p> <p>Foss made line drawings, considered less inflammatory than film, from his photographs. The text was laid out playfully like a cookbook with starters, sauces and main dishes. Even so, the publishers were nervous and Comfort himself pretended he was only the editor. The first print-run was a timorous 10,000. The result was wholly unforeseen, like the day the young Alex Comfort, conducting a chemical experiment in his parents' greenhouse in Barnet, blew up the greenhouse and blew off his hand. The Joy of Sex just exploded. It seemed to blow Comfort's marriage to pieces too. He divorced, married Jane, and landed in America where The Joy of Sex was outselling the Bible. He felt at home in California, the epicentre of uninhibited sex, but Jane did not. They came back. </p> <p>It seemed he came to resent the book, as people said \"the joy of sex\" and laughed. </p> <p>In <strong> The 1940s House</strong> (Channel 4) the darkness thickens. \"War,\" said 10-year-old Ben, \"is not a good game.

While in Canada he married his Latvian wife, Valda, with whom he had three children, and in the 1964 winter Olympics represented Canada in the bobsleigh event. By the mid-1980s he had tired of Canada and, according to Charles Saumarez-Smith, director of the National Portrait Gallery, \"decided to enjoy himself.\" \"He is interested in history, in writing, in collecting and in travel and adventure, and since returning to Britain he has indulged those passions,\" said Mr Saumarez-Smith. \"He is an incredibly energetic man, inventive, creative and independent-minded. He is someone who has his own views and wants to put them into practice interestingly. He is not conventional.\" Mr Ondaatje has said his change of career from financier followed the discovery of a book called The Devil Drives by Fawn Brody, a biography of the Victorian explorer Sir Richard Burton, whom Mr Ondaatje would become fascinated by. That book touched a deeper part of Mr Ondaatje's psyche, and he became concerned about how he would be remembered. \"I don't want to die with financier written on my gravestone,\" he said. \"Nobel invented gunpowder but is remembered for the Nobel Peace Prize. I have the fear of dying with the wrong acclaim.\" Since discovering the life of Burton, he has traced the explorer's footsteps through Africa and India. He has written six books, including Journey to the Source of the Nile, Sindh Revisited, both accounts of his recreation of Burton's adventures, and Maneater of Punani about his Sri Lankan roots. Yesterday when the news of his donation broke he was away from his Exmoor home, researching his next book, Hemingway in Africa. He is an avid collector of south-east Asian art and a benefactor of numerous institutions in Canada, Sri Lanka, the Caribbean and the UK. A keen cricket fan, Somerset County Cricket Club is among them. Mr Ondaatje is far from a silent donor. One of his passions is the Royal Geographical Society where he is a trustee, attending three meetings a year, and a member of its fund-raising advisory group trying to raise \u00a310m over five years. He regularly attends its Monday night lecture programme and was last seen in its Kensington Gore headquarters in December listening to Sir Crispin Tickell talk about the dangers posed by near-earth objects. \"He has a lovely sense of fun, a very nice sense of humour. He comes across as immensely cultured, well-read, highly educated and a thoughtful man,\" said Rita Gardner, director of the Royal Geographical Society. \"He is outgoing, energetic and enthusiastic, but I've never heard him express anything about politics.\" \"He is hugely entertaining, distinguished and inventive, but I get the impression he is something of an outsider\", said a leading figure in the art world. \"As for his approach he is a bit of a populist in the best sense of the word. He is in favour of providing access to the very best for all.\" Other gifts Ondaatje's previous donations include: \u0095 \u00a32.75m to the National Portrait Gallery to build the Ondaatje wing \u0095 \u00a310,000 a year to the Royal Society of Portrait Painters for the Ondaatje prize for portraiture \u0095 C$1m (\u00a3465,000) to the Royal Ontaria Museum in Canada to build the Christopher Ondaatje South Asian Gallery Other beneficiaries include: the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Royal Geographical Society, Somerset county cricket club's school of excellence in Taunton, Blundell's school in Devon, the Bermuda National Gallery; Dalhousie University, Canada, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Canada, the National Ballet School of Canada, Massey University, New Zealand Useful links Labour party Committee on standards in public life",

In 1997, shortly after being ennobled by Tony Blair, he was at the centre of controversy over accusations that a \u00a31m donation was linked to a Sainsbury's planning application - a charge vigorously denied by the government. In 1999 he braved calls to resign from his post as science minister since Sainsbury's has invested millions into GM food research. He has also channelled millions into the study of genetically-modified organisms through a charitable foundation he established. But the government insists he has been scrupulous in avoiding conflicts of interest. He resigned as chairman of the family firm on becoming a minister, placed his supermarket holdings in a blind trust and gave up policy responsibility for GM products. One of a handful of high-profile businessman with whom the prime minister is keen to be associated, the 60-year-old, married with three daughters, entered the family firm on graduating from Cambridge. But his passions were always for science and politics rather than business. A strong advocate of innovation, he has described himself as \"romantic\", defining romance as \"having a vision of something you pursue that is way beyond what is reasonable.\" His donation to Labour's election fund yesterday suggests thoughts of a probable second victory now seem the very antithesis of this.

A clinical audit of the suspicious deaths which occurred in his one-man practice at Hyde has produced what Department of Health officials called a \"chilling\" pattern of \"excess deaths\", either at home or at the surgery - often between noon and 3 pm which points to deliberate killings - usually by lethal injection. The report, at least 1cm thick, contains tables which set out the recurring pattern. Days after Dame Janet Smith was appointed to preside over the public inquiry into the scale of Shipman's crimes - over and above the 15 murder convictions reached against him last year - the chief medical officer of health, Liam Donaldson, will publish the report of Richard Baker of Leicester University. Professor Baker went through all the medical records of Shipman, who is serving a life sentence, during his 20 years in Hyde when his only other staff colleague was his wife, who acted as his secretary. He delivered his report to Dr Donaldson, who had been asked to arrange the audit by the health secretary, Alan Milburn. Although it is not clear quite how many deaths can be laid at the GP's door, it is said to be \"definitely\" 236, and probably 250.

Rival taxi firms in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, abandoned business for several hours to send their cars on the slow, five mile drive from the town to a nature reserve where the victim was stabbed through the heart. Flowers and written tributes were laid in the wooded area at Thorpe Hesley, where the body of 30-year-old Sarfraz Khan was found in his burnt-out Ford Mondeo. A 26-year-old man, Craig Gilbert, appeared before Rotherham magistrates on Monday and was remanded in custody for a week, charged with murdering Mr Khan. Yesterday's convoy toured Rotherham before heading out to Thorpe Hesley, where colleagues of Mr Khan also paid trubute to their \"quiet, well-spoken friend\". Mr Khan had only worked for A1 taxis in Rotherham for eight days before the tragedy occured. Police said after Mr Khan's body was found, by a local milkman on his early morning round, that the driver had been stabbed six times after apparently putting up a desperate fight.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There have been 1,300 altogether, one every other Monday for 50 years. Little love letters, I suppose you could call them - my Country Diary pieces from the Lake District. They started when King George VI was on the throne, Clem Attlee the prime minister, and Tony Blair not even a glint in his father's eye. The Korean war had just started, with British troops in action: only five years earlier I had still been serving with the \"forgotten\" 14th Army in Burma.</p> <p>Then, one day towards the end of 1950, right out of the blue, the late AP Wadsworth, editor of what was then the Manchester Guardian, wrote to me - I think he also telephoned - and asked whether I would like to contribute to the paper's Country Diary once a fortnight. We had never met, nor even, probably, heard of each other, but I think my immediate predecessor, the gifted George W Muller of Cockermouth, an original member of the climbing club to which I belonged, who had just died at the age of 75, might have mentioned me. I can think of no other reason why my obscure ramblings about the Lake District in a Lancashire evening paper had come to be known within the august portals of the Guardian. I had known and admired the paper for years, especially the writings of Neville Cardus, partly because, for a few years before the war, I had been the northern music critic of another national paper - also with offices in Deansgate, Manchester. (This had been a fiddle, on my part, in order to get free tickets for the Halle concerts. To my lasting regret I never met Cardus, for I had to dash out at the end of each concert, sometimes before the end, to rush off my piece for the paper).</p> <p>Wadsworth's instructions were simple and to the point. \"Write about anything you like,\" he ordered, \"but for God's sake, keep off birds. We get all we want about them from the others,\" meaning the other diarists. I had to send off my first piece in time for the first Monday in January 1951, and have continued, without a break, ever since - nearly half a million words about hills, snow, tarns, stone walls, red deer, golden eagles, breathtaking scenery and a host of other important things. By and large, I have tried to follow these original instructions, during successive editorships, and kept off birds in general, especially small birds - not being a confirmed twitcher - but have felt free to write, now and again, about mountain birds such as ravens and peregrines and, especially, that magnificent, newly returned denizen of the Lake District, the golden eagle.</p> <p>In those distant days 50 years ago we remained in comparative obscurity, identified only by our initials. So I was AHG, unknown and unsung, for 15 years until, in May 1966, the decision was made, no doubt at the highest level, that we should be named. No longer could we skulk in decent oblivion: suddenly, we were thrust into the limelight. From now on readers would know who we were, perhaps even talk to us in the streets. We would have to be most careful in our revelations.</p> <p>Then there was one day, I think in the early 1970s, when we country cousins were invited down to London to lunch with the Guardian hierarchy. They wanted to see what we looked like and have us photographed. Perhaps they thought we would have straw in our hair, but I seem to remember we appeared pretty ordinary, although on the elderly side. But the talk over the wine was certainly wide-ranging and it was a rare chance, for me at least, to get a whiff of city air. Alastair Hetherington, editor of the Guardian for many years until 1975, who had a cottage in the Lake District near my home, became a close friend. We often walked the hills together and now and again did some rock-climbing - my principal passion for a lifetime. Although rock-climbing, winter mountaineering and skiing - apart from classical music - were my main interests I generally avoided these in my Country Diary pieces, believing they would not interest the average reader, and concentrated, instead, on the hills in more general terms.</p> <p>Originally, and for many years, I wrote from \"Westmorland\" but after this ancient, splendid, unspoiled county was wiped off the map by Whitehall in 1974 it has usually been the \"Lake District\". Occasionally, though, when writing about an area just outside the national park - to cock a snook at authority - I have written from \"Old Westmorland\" hoping that the Whitehall mandarins would notice this. I have also written, frequently, from the Howgills, the Yorkshire Dales, the Northern Pennines and often from my beloved Scottish Highlands, which I know far better than any part of England south of the Lake District. And I have also written from the Alps and the Canadian Rockies but, for the most part, from lovely Lakeland - now sadly, because of mass tourism, not quite the place I knew as a boy, but still the most beautiful corner in England. Although the traffic and the crowds and the tawdriness of some of the \"honeypots\" infuriate me at times I wouldn't live anywhere else - and at least I know where to find the quiet places.</p> <p>I have certainly enjoyed writing these love letters. They have attracted an enormous correspondence - several letters every weekend - and I have replied to every one. Indeed, in old age, letter writing now seems my main activity!

      "bodyText": "There have been 1,300 altogether, one every other Monday for 50 years. Little love letters, I suppose you could call them - my Country Diary pieces from the Lake District. They started when King George VI was on the throne, Clem Attlee the prime minister, and Tony Blair not even a glint in his father's eye. The Korean war had just started, with British troops in action: only five years earlier I had still been serving with the \"forgotten\" 14th Army in Burma. Then, one day towards the end of 1950, right out of the blue, the late AP Wadsworth, editor of what was then the Manchester Guardian, wrote to me - I think he also telephoned - and asked whether I would like to contribute to the paper's Country Diary once a fortnight. We had never met, nor even, probably, heard of each other, but I think my immediate predecessor, the gifted George W Muller of Cockermouth, an original member of the climbing club to which I belonged, who had just died at the age of 75, might have mentioned me. I can think of no other reason why my obscure ramblings about the Lake District in a Lancashire evening paper had come to be known within the august portals of the Guardian. I had known and admired the paper for years, especially the writings of Neville Cardus, partly because, for a few years before the war, I had been the northern music critic of another national paper - also with offices in Deansgate, Manchester. (This had been a fiddle, on my part, in order to get free tickets for the Halle concerts. To my lasting regret I never met Cardus, for I had to dash out at the end of each concert, sometimes before the end, to rush off my piece for the paper). Wadsworth's instructions were simple and to the point. \"Write about anything you like,\" he ordered, \"but for God's sake, keep off birds. We get all we want about them from the others,\" meaning the other diarists. I had to send off my first piece in time for the first Monday in January 1951, and have continued, without a break, ever since - nearly half a million words about hills, snow, tarns, stone walls, red deer, golden eagles, breathtaking scenery and a host of other important things. By and large, I have tried to follow these original instructions, during successive editorships, and kept off birds in general, especially small birds - not being a confirmed twitcher - but have felt free to write, now and again, about mountain birds such as ravens and peregrines and, especially, that magnificent, newly returned denizen of the Lake District, the golden eagle. In those distant days 50 years ago we remained in comparative obscurity, identified only by our initials. So I was AHG, unknown and unsung, for 15 years until, in May 1966, the decision was made, no doubt at the highest level, that we should be named. No longer could we skulk in decent oblivion: suddenly, we were thrust into the limelight. From now on readers would know who we were, perhaps even talk to us in the streets. We would have to be most careful in our revelations. Then there was one day, I think in the early 1970s, when we country cousins were invited down to London to lunch with the Guardian hierarchy. They wanted to see what we looked like and have us photographed. Perhaps they thought we would have straw in our hair, but I seem to remember we appeared pretty ordinary, although on the elderly side. But the talk over the wine was certainly wide-ranging and it was a rare chance, for me at least, to get a whiff of city air. Alastair Hetherington, editor of the Guardian for many years until 1975, who had a cottage in the Lake District near my home, became a close friend. We often walked the hills together and now and again did some rock-climbing - my principal passion for a lifetime. Although rock-climbing, winter mountaineering and skiing - apart from classical music - were my main interests I generally avoided these in my Country Diary pieces, believing they would not interest the average reader, and concentrated, instead, on the hills in more general terms. Originally, and for many years, I wrote from \"Westmorland\" but after this ancient, splendid, unspoiled county was wiped off the map by Whitehall in 1974 it has usually been the \"Lake District\". Occasionally, though, when writing about an area just outside the national park - to cock a snook at authority - I have written from \"Old Westmorland\" hoping that the Whitehall mandarins would notice this. I have also written, frequently, from the Howgills, the Yorkshire Dales, the Northern Pennines and often from my beloved Scottish Highlands, which I know far better than any part of England south of the Lake District. And I have also written from the Alps and the Canadian Rockies but, for the most part, from lovely Lakeland - now sadly, because of mass tourism, not quite the place I knew as a boy, but still the most beautiful corner in England. Although the traffic and the crowds and the tawdriness of some of the \"honeypots\" infuriate me at times I wouldn't live anywhere else - and at least I know where to find the quiet places. I have certainly enjoyed writing these love letters. They have attracted an enormous correspondence - several letters every weekend - and I have replied to every one. Indeed, in old age, letter writing now seems my main activity! Two of my 12 books - A Year in the Fells (Robert Hale,1976) and A Lakeland Mountain Diary (The Crowood Press, 1990) - were based on my Country Diary . I like to think that the popularity of these diary pieces might have partly prompted my appointment as MBE five years ago, \"for services to literature and the Lake District\". I'll be 90 this January, God willing, and hope I'll be getting into the hills, as usual - little hills mostly, now. I had to give up climbing at 78 years of age and skiing at 80. But, after nearly 80 years of wandering about on the Lakeland fells, I can always find something new, or a little different or, at least, interesting. Hills are always interesting.",

David Dunaway, a Harley Street plastic surgeon, said he would be concerned about her psychological and physical development. \"Somebody of this age may not have reached psychological or physical maturity,\" he said. \"We would have to decide if it is appropriate, depending on whether she is mature enough. The potential complications and the downside of the operation would have to be made quite clear.\" He said he would recommend a psychological assessment before going ahead. \"I would not rule it out, but I would make absolutely sure it was not just a whim to get someone through a difficult phase in late adolescence.\". Eileen Bradbury, a psychologist who advises surgeons at the Alexandra Hospital in Cheadle, Cheshire, said she was particularly worried that Jenna wanted the operation so that she could be successful. \"That is a very disturbing belief for a 15-year-old girl to have, and also a false one,\" she said. \"I have seen women coming for surgery who work in television and they say they have to have it done or they won't get the work. I usually go along with that because it is probably true. \"But to be successful in life, or in a relationship, is a completely different matter. Implants are totally irrelevant. Of all the cosmetic operations, implants are the one you have to be most careful about.\" She said she was concerned that Jenna's mother had had plastic surgery herself. Linda Blair, a clinical psychologist from the University of Bath, said Mrs Franklin was giving \"the wrong message to her daughter - she should be saying you are beautiful already and I love you unconditionally\". Christine Williamson, of the Silicone Support Group, which offers help and advice to those whose breast implants become faulty, described it as the birthday present from hell. \"She could be buying her daughter a lifetime of misery and suffering,\" she said. \"Lots of people are late developers and it is ridiculous to consider a breast enlargement operation at this age. These implants only have a lifespan of about four years, if she is lucky.\" Ms Williamson said there was a growing problem of young women having breast enlargement surgery. \"Girls with small breasts are made to feel inadequate, but they don't realise that implants can make them ill.\"",

The firm specialises in chameleon outlets which begin the evening as restaurants, later turning into drinks-led bars and nightclubs. </p> <p>A trading update yesterday said like-for-like sales leapt 18% during December, with six new openings pushing total takings up 135% to \u00a35.3m. </p> <p>These figures bode well for others in the industry - none of the bigger players have yet reported on their Christmas perfomances. Chorion's finance director, Malcolm Gardner, said: \"The feeling is that it was a generally good Christmas period for everyone. There was no sign of the post-millennium lull that people feared.\" </p> <p>Chorion's shares, however, were subdued, edging up just 1p to 38p. The stock, listed on the Alternative Investment Market, has barely moved since this column tipped it in October. The City is not keen on the company's structure - as well as nightclubs, it has an unrelated business which exploits the intellectual property rights to cartoon characters such as Noddy. Investors are keen for a demerger, to allow the two elements to flourish independently, although some doubt the intellectual property side is big enough to be unleashed alone. Chorion says it is in talks to buy the rights to more characters which, if successful, could provide critical mass. </p> <p>A demerger is unlikely before April, by which time Chorion will have a three-year trading record, allowing it to synchronise a split with a move from Aim to the main market. Analysts at Old Mutual Securities reckon the combined value of the two entities will be worth 64p a share. </p> <p>In the meantime, the firm's Tiger, Tiger bars are burning bright, with more openings planned here and abroad. Broker Teather &amp; Greenwood expects profits of \u00a39.2m this year. The firm has a market capitalisation of \u00a3194m. Hold, in the hope of action later this year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Entertainment company Chorion had a lucrative Christmas, as revellers packed into its trendy Tiger, Tiger and On Anon late-night bars. The firm specialises in chameleon outlets which begin the evening as restaurants, later turning into drinks-led bars and nightclubs. A trading update yesterday said like-for-like sales leapt 18% during December, with six new openings pushing total takings up 135% to \u00a35.3m. These figures bode well for others in the industry - none of the bigger players have yet reported on their Christmas perfomances. Chorion's finance director, Malcolm Gardner, said: \"The feeling is that it was a generally good Christmas period for everyone. There was no sign of the post-millennium lull that people feared.\" Chorion's shares, however, were subdued, edging up just 1p to 38p. The stock, listed on the Alternative Investment Market, has barely moved since this column tipped it in October. The City is not keen on the company's structure - as well as nightclubs, it has an unrelated business which exploits the intellectual property rights to cartoon characters such as Noddy. Investors are keen for a demerger, to allow the two elements to flourish independently, although some doubt the intellectual property side is big enough to be unleashed alone. Chorion says it is in talks to buy the rights to more characters which, if successful, could provide critical mass. A demerger is unlikely before April, by which time Chorion will have a three-year trading record, allowing it to synchronise a split with a move from Aim to the main market. Analysts at Old Mutual Securities reckon the combined value of the two entities will be worth 64p a share. In the meantime, the firm's Tiger, Tiger bars are burning bright, with more openings planned here and abroad. Broker Teather &amp; Greenwood expects profits of \u00a39.2m this year. The firm has a market capitalisation of \u00a3194m. Hold, in the hope of action later this year.",

      "bodyText": "Iraq-watchers took out their magnifying glasses yesterday to scrutinise pictures from Baghdad purportedly showing Saddam Hussein chairing a cabinet meeting. Depending on who you believe, the Iraqi leader is dead, incapacitated ... or his usual robust self. The latest rumours surfaced after a military parade on Sunday in which President Saddam stood for four or five hours, saluting the troops as they marched past by firing a rifle into the air. \"He fired more than 142 rifle shots, using one hand,\" said an Iraqi government spokesman, Salam Khatab. \"Most of the youth could not do such.\" But according to Iranian-backed opposition sources, he suffered a severe stroke during or shortly after the parade. Other opposition sources in London suggest that he had a minor stroke or heart attack. The Saudi-owned al-Hayat newspaper, citing \"trusted Iraqi sources\", said that President Saddam had felt chest pains and had been taken to hospital, where a medical team under Dr Aziz Mahmoud Shukri \"confirmed to those accompanying the president that he was suffering the effects of standing for a long time in the cold\". On Wednesday Iraqi television showed the president, who is officially 63, looking his usual self as he walked into the cabinet room wearing a brown suit, but there was no way of confirming when the film was shot. An official denial of his illness as \"a nonsensical fabrication that is not even worth responding to\" did little to dampen the speculation. Some analysts even saw the denial as suspicious, noting that the Iraqi authorities do not usually comment on such reports. But a Kurdish opposition source in London suggested that the reports could be part of a disinformation campaign by President Saddam himself. \"His security service spreads rumours that he is dangerously ill or has been assassinated, then after a few days you see him making a speech on TV.\" The purpose might be to flush out opponents of the regime. In July, when he made an odd and unusually short speech to mark the 32nd anniversary of the coup that brought his Ba'ath party to power, there were claims that he was seriously ill. Two weeks later, and apparently in good health, he welcomed President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela to Iraq and personally drove him on a tour of Baghdad. In September there were reports that he was about to undergo chemotherapy for lymph cancer. A subsequent Israeli report said the story was based on a misunderstanding: the treatment was for a senior member of his regime. Analysts were reluctant yesterday to commit themselves either way. Most agreed that if he were dead or seriously ill the regime might well conceal it until his successor's position had been secured. Few expect a smooth transition, because of the rivalry between his two sons, Uday, 36, and Qusay, 34.

      "body": "<p>Children returning to school after the Christmas holidays could fall victim to an outbreak of measles for the first time in a decade, because of low uptakes of the MMR jab.</p> <p>Large numbers of parents have not had their children immunised after fears that the combined measles, mumps and rubella jab is linked to autism and bowel disease.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation recommends that 95% of children be immunised against measles to guarantee protection of the entire population. In the UK, 88% of children have been immunised and this figures drops to 75% in some areas.</p> <p>Public health officials warned yesterday of the seriousness of the situation, stressing that Britain could again see children dying of a preventable childhood infection.</p> <p>The fall is most serious in London and the south-east. The latest figures collected by the public health laboratory service (PHLS), up to June last year, reveal that in six London boroughs less than 80% of children under two have had their first MMR jab. In Croydon, only 74% have been vaccinated. In Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster, Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham, only 76% have had their first MMR. In Berkshire, 79% of two-year-olds have been immunised.</p> <p>The figures for the first MMR jab are higher than for the second injection, which is given shortly before a child starts school. Most children will have immunity after the first dose, but some will not. Only 61.5% of five-year-olds in London have had the second jab. Trent, the south-east and the north-west of England are all on around 74%.</p> <p>An epidemic of either measles, mumps or rubella is now possible. In the Netherlands, the disease rampaged through a community which refused to vaccinate its children. There were 1,750 cases and three children died. Ireland, where vaccination has dropped below 80%, is experiencing its worst measles outbreak for seven years, with 1,220 cases so far and two deaths.</p> <p>Parents' worries stem from research carried out at the Royal Free hospital in London. A group of scientists, led by Andrew Wakefield, have spent years in pursuit of their theories that there are links between bowel disease, autism and the measles virus. The crucial paper raising the possibility that the vaccine was to blame, published in the respected medical journal the Lancet in February 1998, caused uproar in the public health community and received wide publicity.</p> <p>A group of experts convened by the Medical Research Council at the request of the chief medical officer, then Sir Kenneth Calman, studied the Wakefield research, interviewing the scientists and looking at their source material. They found no evidence to implicate the MMR jab in either bowel disease or autism.</p> <p>But the scare took hold and vaccination rates dropped. The first generation of children not immunised before their second birthday three years ago are now starting school, and the PHLS is urging parents to get then vaccinated.</p> <p>Brian Duerden, medical director of the PHLS, said: \"This is a serious situation. We have to do all we can to convince parents that the MMR jab is safe. We have a safe vaccine which we have looked at in detail because of concerns that were raised and we have found it is not linked to these side effects people are worried about.</p> <p>\"The government is well aware of the problem we are facing and is determined to educate people about the importance of having the vaccine, and quite rightly so.\"</p> <p>Some parents have asked GPs for single doses of measles vaccine for their children, instead of the combination, but the government is against this. It argues that the triple jab is just as safe and more efficient.</p> <p>Some 2,000 families are contemplating legal action against the vaccine manufacturers.</p> <p>The worries do not seem to have taken root in Scotland, however. Statistics show that 93% of children had been given the vaccine by their second birthday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Children returning to school after the Christmas holidays could fall victim to an outbreak of measles for the first time in a decade, because of low uptakes of the MMR jab. Large numbers of parents have not had their children immunised after fears that the combined measles, mumps and rubella jab is linked to autism and bowel disease. The World Health Organisation recommends that 95% of children be immunised against measles to guarantee protection of the entire population. In the UK, 88% of children have been immunised and this figures drops to 75% in some areas. Public health officials warned yesterday of the seriousness of the situation, stressing that Britain could again see children dying of a preventable childhood infection. The fall is most serious in London and the south-east. The latest figures collected by the public health laboratory service (PHLS), up to June last year, reveal that in six London boroughs less than 80% of children under two have had their first MMR jab. In Croydon, only 74% have been vaccinated. In Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster, Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham, only 76% have had their first MMR. In Berkshire, 79% of two-year-olds have been immunised. The figures for the first MMR jab are higher than for the second injection, which is given shortly before a child starts school. Most children will have immunity after the first dose, but some will not. Only 61.5% of five-year-olds in London have had the second jab. Trent, the south-east and the north-west of England are all on around 74%. An epidemic of either measles, mumps or rubella is now possible. In the Netherlands, the disease rampaged through a community which refused to vaccinate its children. There were 1,750 cases and three children died. Ireland, where vaccination has dropped below 80%, is experiencing its worst measles outbreak for seven years, with 1,220 cases so far and two deaths. Parents' worries stem from research carried out at the Royal Free hospital in London. A group of scientists, led by Andrew Wakefield, have spent years in pursuit of their theories that there are links between bowel disease, autism and the measles virus. The crucial paper raising the possibility that the vaccine was to blame, published in the respected medical journal the Lancet in February 1998, caused uproar in the public health community and received wide publicity. A group of experts convened by the Medical Research Council at the request of the chief medical officer, then Sir Kenneth Calman, studied the Wakefield research, interviewing the scientists and looking at their source material. They found no evidence to implicate the MMR jab in either bowel disease or autism. But the scare took hold and vaccination rates dropped. The first generation of children not immunised before their second birthday three years ago are now starting school, and the PHLS is urging parents to get then vaccinated. Brian Duerden, medical director of the PHLS, said: \"This is a serious situation. We have to do all we can to convince parents that the MMR jab is safe. We have a safe vaccine which we have looked at in detail because of concerns that were raised and we have found it is not linked to these side effects people are worried about. \"The government is well aware of the problem we are facing and is determined to educate people about the importance of having the vaccine, and quite rightly so.\" Some parents have asked GPs for single doses of measles vaccine for their children, instead of the combination, but the government is against this. It argues that the triple jab is just as safe and more efficient. Some 2,000 families are contemplating legal action against the vaccine manufacturers. The worries do not seem to have taken root in Scotland, however. Statistics show that 93% of children had been given the vaccine by their second birthday.",

      "bodyText": "The former German tennis star Boris Becker fired the first courtroom volley yesterday in an attempt to keep his divorce proceedings from becoming an out-of-control transatlantic media spectacle. Lined up against the triple Wimbledon men's singles champion was an opponent as formidable as any he ever faced across the net in his championship winning days: the German media. Becker appeared in the Miami-Dade county family court in Florida to ask Judge Maynard Gross to exclude the public and the media from the proceedings brought against him by his estranged wife Barbara for custody of their two children and ownership of their luxury home on Fisher Island, Miami. Barbara Becker, the daughter of a German mother and black American GI father, wants her alimony and child-support action to be conducted in public, giving the media full access to documents in the case and perhaps even allowing television cameras into the courtroom. She has the support of a German press pack hungry for any and every detail about the battle between Boris und Babs, as the tabloid Bild-Zeitung calls the celebrity couple. Becker said in an affidavit that he was \"fearful to testify\" in open court, and that he had received repeated threats against \"my life and the life of my family, including the life of my six-year-old son Noah\". In court he said he had been getting threats against his family since 1985, when he first won Wimbledon. He said he received three or four threatening letters a month. \"I did receive one two years ago doing the tournaments on Key Biscayne. I received a kidnapping threat against my children,\" he said through a translator. He said the threat was seeking ransom money. Becker argued that disclosing details of his financial affairs \"gives rise to the fantasies of criminals\". Mrs Becker's lawyers have challenged his claim that the children would be put at greater risk of injury or harm by open proceedings. They said in court papers that Noah and Elias, one, were always protected by security guards while in the United States. Judge Gross must decide whether Becker's petition is sufficiently pressing to shut the public out and seal the court proceedings from reporters, something that is normally done under Florida law where there is a real threat to children in a custody dispute. If he does so, German television channels say, they will immediately begin broadcasting regular live updates from Miami. The case has spiralled from dignified separation to a no-holds-barred divorce and custody battle in little more than a month. In addition to the German media, the Miami Herald newspaper and a local television station have filed affidavits asking for the case to remain open and accessible to the media. Whatever the outcome of the procedural hearing, Judge Gross has set another hearing for Monday, when he will decide whether the Florida courts have the power to hear Mrs Becker's custody and matrimonial property claims. The couple were married in Germany and had their primary residence in Munich, and their children were born and lived mostly in Germany until Mrs Becker brought them to the United States in December. The divorce has become an all-absorbing national drama in Germany. For years their marriage gave them the reputation of one of Europe's most emotionally mature celebrity couples. Underlying the case is the increasingly prominent problem of international child custody law under the 1980 Hague Convention. The issue has become a bone of contention between the United States and Germany, which is widely accused internationally of making custody judgments which unfairly favour the German parent in such disputes.",

      "bodyText": "Hospitals have been ordered to improve their decontamination and sterilisation procedures to reduce the theoretical risk of patients catching the fatal human form of BSE. The government yesterday promised \u00a3200m would be spent in England alone on new equipment - and confirmed that surgeons must use throw-away instruments for all tonsil operations in Britain, a change that will cost a further \u00a330m a year. The measures, part of an extensive overhaul of hospital hygiene to fight the spread of variant CJD, compare with the \u00a36bn cost of programmes to control BSE in cattle and lost exports. Ministers and senior officials hope that the modernisation of cleansing will help reduce the costs for far more expensive rekitting of hospitals with disposable equipment for more complicated and more expensive operations than tonsillectomy, which is usually performed on children with equipment costing just a few hundred pounds. But they concede that the changes in that operation, expected to be completed this year, could provide valuable lessons for far wider use of once-only instruments if that were necessary. Eighty-three people have died from vCJD, with five known victims still alive, but scientists still have little idea of the eventual size of the epidemic. The Department of Health is so worried that present decontamination, sterilisation and even washing arrangements are not up to scratch that it is conducting a national survey and has appointed a central management team to ensure improvements are carried out. Every NHS trust is expected to have an official responsible for changes. Problems with existing sterilisation equipment, regardless of the vCJD threat, were highlighted late last year by orthopaedic surgeons at a Portsmouth hospital who threatened to stop all emergency operations, saying patients' lives were at risk. The new money for equipment in England will be phased over two years. The NHS in Scotland set aside \u00a33m for improvements this year and an audit is under way to see just what changes may be needed in Wales. Pat Troop, deputy chief medical officer for England, said: \"We still do not know how many people might be incubating vCJD. There is a theoretical risk that it can be passed through surgical instruments from those who have yet to show symptoms of the disease. The highest standards of decontamination are the cornerstone of our strategy to reduce risks.\"",

      "body": "<p>He is called \"the father of film technique\", the man \"who invented Hollywood\", \"the first to photograph thought\" and even \"the Shakespeare of the screen\". Yet, despite all this praise, DW Griffith is a movie-maker we don't really know. Instead, we mythologise him as the \"pioneer\" who invented the techniques of narrative film, and as the director who made The Birth of a Nation, the biggest hit of the silent era, and then Intolerance, the biggest flop, which reduced him to penury and a lonely death in obscurity. </p> <p>More recently, he has been castigated as one of America's most pernicious racists, thanks to his glorification of the Ku Klux Klan in The Birth of a Nation. Until recently the Directors Guild of America called its prestigious lifetime achievement honour the DW Griffith award, but his name was dropped in 1999. </p> <p>His contribution to cinematic technique, however, was outstanding. \"There were others at the time who were technically better,\" says Kevin Brownlow, the film-restorer and historian who is introducing a rare screening of Griffith's Intolerance, with full orchestra at London's Royal Festival Hall. \"But none had his artistic bravery. There were other directors, such as Von Stroheim and Allan Dwan, who learnt from Griffith and contributed a lot - but Griffith did the biggest job of all. His films altered the whole course of cinema.\" </p> <p>Like most middle-class Americans at the time, Griffith despised film. He preferred the theatre. As the son of a Confederate army colonel, David Wark Griffith considered himself a southern gentleman. Nonetheless, he was brought up in relative poverty in rural Kentucky and worked as a shop assistant and hop-picker before he became an actor in a travelling theatre company. Even then he never achieved his ambition of becoming a playwright or stage director. So, in 1907, he reluctantly moved into the movies where - because of his ability to turn a film around quickly - he became the main director of the Biograph company. But he still saw cinema as a shoddy stopgap. In 1908, he told his wife: \"In a way, it's very nice but, you know, we can't go on living for ever and not tell our friends and family how we earn our living.\" </p> <p>\"He had done more than 400 films for Biograph by the time he made The Birth of a Nation,\" says Brownlow, \"and he hadn't invented all that much. Griffith had very talented press agents, who said he invented absolutely everything.\" </p> <p>All the narrative techniques of modern-day cinema - the close-up, the tracking shot, the flashback, the fade-out and so on - had been established by 1912. Nevertheless, says Brownlow, \"while the components had been devised no one was fully exploiting them\". It was Griffith who \"struck the first match\". The French film-maker Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, according to Brownlow, \"linked his scenes with dissolves way back in 1899, but it was Griffith who made the fade-out his trademark; the very first film ever made [by Thomas Edison in 1894] was a close-up - created 13 years before Griffith got into pictures - but filmgoers never forgot Griffith's close-ups. They were under the impression that because Griffith was so good at showing off these new devices, he'd invented them.\" </p> <p>Even so, by the time he completed The Birth of a Nation - originally entitled The Clansman - in 1915, Griffith had polished and put cinematic grammar into its current place. The previous year he had said: \"We are striving for real acting. When you saw only the small, full-length figures, it was necessary to have exaggerated acting, the waving of the hands and so on. The close-up enabled us to reach real acting, restraint, acting that is a duplicate of real life.\" So, solely through the use of the close-up, Griffith moved screen acting away from pantomine towards a facial style which meant that a look could now sustain or propel a whole sequence of a film. There is one other refinement, which was to be just as influential, that Griffith brought to the cinema a year later in one of the most extraordinary epics ever made. </p> <p>Just before the first world war, says Brownlow, \"the American film industry was very much secondary to the French and Italian because they could both do far bigger pictures\". Griffith himself had already tried to do a big picture, Judith of Bethulia, in 1913 but it wasn't nearly as spectacular as Italian epics like Cabiria. Three years later, however, Griffith had money pouring into his pocket via the box office from The Birth of a Nation. His next film would therefore be his definitive response to the Europeans. </p> <p>\"Move those 10,000 horses a trifle to the right, and that mob out there, three feet forward,\" was among the instructions Griffith allegedly gave during his direction of Intolerance. Though there was little historical evidence to support their presence, Griffith wanted white elephants for his immense epic, eight of them perched on massive mushroom pedestals, dwarfing the colossal court of Belshazzar's palace and all built out of plaster alongside a dirt road which would become Sunset Boulevard. Along that trail came 4,000 extras on $2 a day to impersonate Assyrian soldiers, Numidian eunuchs, priests of Bel, handmaidens of Ishtar, slaves of Mesopotamia; and, soaring up over this vision of Babylon on a 100-foot camera-crane, Griffith brought it all to life. All this activity was immortalised in the Taviani brothers' Good Morning, Babylon, in which Charles Dance played Griffith. </p> <p>To begin with, the director asked for a big modern-day banqueting scene to be designed; but nobody on the set really knew what was going on because Griffith didn't have a script. All the crew knew was that they were moving between different historical periods on four different movies, all called The Mother and the Law. The final film, though, isn't sequential - the stories don't follow each other chronologically. Instead Griffith mixed up his four plots in the editing room and intercut between Babylon, Christ's Judea, Reformation Europe and modern America, and this is why Brownlow thinks the film is regarded by many as the greatest of all. </p> <p>\"The way he brings all four stories to a climax at the same time so that you're chasing along in a chariot, the cross is being carried through Jerusalem, the Huguenots are being slaughtered and you're tearing along in a train across modern America, is just amazing. The scale of his ambition and the level to which that ambition is achieved are astounding.\" </p> <p>Ironically, for a film that foreshortened what Brownlow thinks would have been years of slow technical progress, Intolerance marked the beginning of Griffith's decline. It flopped badly at the box office and Griffith then dug himself into a deeper financial hole by buying the picture back from the banks. For a while, his career revived. He had hits such as Orphans of the Storm and his 1919 movie, Broken Blossoms, and even introduced another technical innovation - the use of gauze and filters on cameras to lend a luminous light that separates characters from the background - which would in turn give us those fabulous, soft close-ups of silent stars. </p> <p>Legend has it that Griffith died unknown and in poverty. In fact he had many friends - especially actresses from his films, who adored him - and previous successes provided him with an annuity of $30,000. But work wasn't forthcoming and, as the scriptwriter Charles Brackett said at Griffith's funeral in 1948, \"What does a man full of vitality care for the honours of the past?\" But then, of how many men can it be said, as it was said of Griffith: \"He thought that cinema should be an art, so he turned it into one\"? </p> <p>\u0095 Intolerance, with music performed by the London Philarmonic Orchestra and conducted by Carl Davis, will be shown on January 20 at the Royal Festival Hall, London, SE1 (box office: 020-7960 4242).</p>",

It's been a long time since I saw three new movies in a week and loved them all. </p> <p>Let me rephrase that. I loved Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, and, while I had as many problems with Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away as I've had with all his recent movies, the experience of seeing it with a jubilant, expectant holiday crowd was more than adequate compensation for its shortcomings. </p> <p>I do love a packed house. Perhaps that's because, given the nature of my job, I find myself in so few. Because I have to see so many movies, I tend to hit the less thickly populated bargain matinees attended by little old ladies, school truants, adulterous couples and fugitive criminals. </p> <p>Otherwise, I see new movies in the sterile atmosphere of a studio screening room, surrounded by jaded reviewers and associated prose-farmers. There's the fat, scruffy critic from the local freesheet, a man I thought was a gutter-basking derelict until I overheard his name. I don't demand that critics wear black tie and tails, but I will draw the line at candlewick dressing gowns and shirt-tails tangled up in one's flies. Then there's the usual complement of freeloaders from the studio and the PR company, and often a small group of know-nothing film majors from UCLA and USC - because they teach film criticism to kids in college these days. (I didn't stop laughing at that news until it started to make me feel ill.) </p> <p>And if we're really lucky, the terrified PR reps will delay the screening until the Big Critic from the Los Angeles Times arrives - sometimes by up to an hour. If they have the temerity to roll the movie one nanosecond before this august figure (a petulant, over-the-hill hack) is in his reserved seat, we can sit back and enjoy a sustained, spittle-flecked tirade that usually includes the phrase: \"Do you have any idea who I am?\" </p> <p>All of this just alienates me from the movie we're about to see. Critics and film pros don't laugh or cry in the places paying audiences do. They're always too busy looking for an angle from which to one-up the next scribbler, or you overhear them in the elevator saying that they plan to \"champion\" this or that movie, or that they won't \"dignify\" it with a decent notice. Real people just want to see a good movie, which is why I so love a cinema groaning to the rafters with a Saturday night crowd, dying to be thrilled. </p> <p>I've been seeing these crowds over the holiday season. The audience for Cast Away at my local multiplex was teeming with families, kids, old ladies and teenage gangbangers. The line outside stretched 60ft and no one resented the crowded auditorium. I love settling in and feeling that hush of expectation as the lights dim. </p> <p>Throughout the movie, people talk and react viscerally to what's on the screen. Sometimes you can hear a Mexican dad translating all the dialogue into Spanish for his children. In a half-empty house I don't usually put up with this for long - I'm a strong advocate of yelling \"Shut your goddamn trap!\" at recalcitrant chatterboxes - but when the movie is second-rate, like Cast Away, then the audience can make up for it. </p> <p>Cast Away did provide me with a reminder of one phenomenon I'd forgotten about. When Tom Hanks is washed up on a desert island, the film enters an almost silent hour as he learns to survive, feed and clothe himself. Silence makes audiences nervous and the noise level in the auditorium will rise to fill the space. Popcorn bags crackle louder and you can hear people masticating loudly in the darkness. As Mike Hodges, a director who knows the strategic use of silence, once said: \"There's so much music in movies because the modern audience doesn't like to hear itself eating.\" </p> <p>But my treks to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Traffic made me even more optimistic about the movie-going experience. Tiger is playing on about one 50th of the screens allocated for a piece of Christmas crap like The Family Man, but the audiences - which are so mixed as to defy demographic categorisation - are huge. I was turned away four times before I could see it with a paying audience (for me, it had previously transcended the pitfalls of a hacks' screening) and when I did finally see it on an Imax screen the size of a warehouse wall, I saw an audience utterly rapt. Who says US audiences can't handle sub-titles? Someone who thinks we're all stupid, apparently. Likewise Traffic, which has been showing in four cinemas in the whole country - one in LA - and for which audiences have been beating down the doors. </p> <p>Good movies attracting massive audiences? For a brief, happy moment all the stars are in alignment. For a few days I have been able to say something I rarely feel: \"I love going to the movies again.\" </p> <p>I'm praying it'll last.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Sunlight protects people against multiple sclerosis (MS) and prevents high blood pressure and strokes, according to research at the University of East Anglia. </p> <p>Two related studies, covering 30 countries from the equator to the poles, show the beneficial effects of ultraviolet light in sunlight on both conditions. </p> <p>Graham Bentham told the conference in Plymouth that it was already known that people in northern latitudes such as Britain were 100 times more likely than those on the equator to get MS but no one knew why. Within the UK there was a marked difference, with one in 100 getting MS in England and Wales and one in 500 in Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p> <p>MS is a degenerative disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system. Professor Bentham said sunlight had the effect of suppressing the immune system, but he believed ultraviolet light stimulating the production of vitamin D was the probable protective element. People on the west coasts of Norway and Iceland, who ate oily fish such as herring and salmon, which were rich in vitamin D, had lower MS rates than populations in similar northern climes. \"It is the vitamin D that is the key. If the body has enough then it protects against MS. More work is needed but it looks as if this could become an important method of preventing the disease.\" </p> <p>Fellow researcher Andy Jones, a lecturer in environmental science, looked at blood pressure, which causes heart problems and strokes. People living near the equator had considerably lower blood pressure than those in temperate regions.

      "bodyText": "Sunlight protects people against multiple sclerosis (MS) and prevents high blood pressure and strokes, according to research at the University of East Anglia. Two related studies, covering 30 countries from the equator to the poles, show the beneficial effects of ultraviolet light in sunlight on both conditions. Graham Bentham told the conference in Plymouth that it was already known that people in northern latitudes such as Britain were 100 times more likely than those on the equator to get MS but no one knew why. Within the UK there was a marked difference, with one in 100 getting MS in England and Wales and one in 500 in Scotland and Northern Ireland. MS is a degenerative disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system. Professor Bentham said sunlight had the effect of suppressing the immune system, but he believed ultraviolet light stimulating the production of vitamin D was the probable protective element. People on the west coasts of Norway and Iceland, who ate oily fish such as herring and salmon, which were rich in vitamin D, had lower MS rates than populations in similar northern climes. \"It is the vitamin D that is the key. If the body has enough then it protects against MS. More work is needed but it looks as if this could become an important method of preventing the disease.\" Fellow researcher Andy Jones, a lecturer in environmental science, looked at blood pressure, which causes heart problems and strokes. People living near the equator had considerably lower blood pressure than those in temperate regions. Again he believed that vitamin D production caused by sunlight was responsible for the difference. One of the key factors again was diet. Stone age man evolved in sunny places and had a high calcium intake because of the meat and raw plants that he ate. With modern eating habits, vitamin D was used by the body to absorb more calcium and avoid any deficiency. When there was a shortage of vitamin D the body produced parathyroid hormone, which caused increased blood pressure. His theory was backed by research which showed that nurses who took calcium supplements had a 25% reduction in heart disease. Both men were reluctant to reverse advice against sunbathing, with its risk of skin cancer. Dr Jones said: \"We are talking about an incremental benefit on sunlight over years, not one big hit lying on a beach.

      "body": "<p>There was no doubt about the topic of debate yesterday - the surprise rate cut from the US Federal Reserve. While analysts and traders were mulling over the implications, punters were concentrating on matters of a more speculative nature: in particular, the upward movement of <strong>Blue Circle's</strong> share price. </p> <p>On a day when many defensive issues were heading south, Blue Circle stood out with a gain of 17p to 455p in good volume. Throughout the session there had been a specific rumour driving the stock higher - namely that Lafarge, the French building materials group, is coming back with a new bid, apparently at around 495p to 500p. </p> <p>Last May, Lafarge made a 450p a share hostile bid for Blue Circle, which lapsed after the French group failed to attract enough acceptances for the deal to be unconditional. Although London's takeover rules prevent Lafarge from tabling another hostile bid until May it could, claim the gossips, strike an agreed deal and at the mooted price Blue Circle would probably accept. </p> <p>Given its healthy financial position - it recently sold its paint and mortar interests for around \u00a3500m - and the fact that it controls 32.2% of Blue Circle's equity, most analysts reckon that it is a question of when, not if, Lafarge resumes its pursuit. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the mood in the London market was brighter yesterday after the Federal Reserve's knight in shining armour performance. </p> <p>All the main indices moved higher during the day, with technology, media and telecom stocks faring the best. </p> <p>Underneath the market's euphoric response was more than a little disquiet. </p> <p>Yes, the FTSE 100 had risen 145.7 points to 6,185.6, and the FTSE Techmark 100 had put on 115.26 to 2,459.87 - but in both cases, the gains did little more than mask the losses sustained on Wednesday. </p> <p>Most did not know what to make of the Fed's action. On one hand it was clearly a good thing that the Fed had reacted to the slowing American economy, dealers said. But they pointed out that this rate cut - and any that follow - could take six months to filter through to the economy, in which time profits warnings will continue to roll in. </p> <p>Moreover, some thought the move smacked of desperation and pointed out that the Fed rarely acts between meetings and when it does - 1998, for instance - it is usually because something, somewhere, has gone badly wrong. </p> <p>Nonetheless, just about everything in the new technology world was heading higher. <strong>Colt Telecom</strong> was the pick of the bunch, rising 235p, or 18.22%, to \u00a315.25. Other strong performers included <strong>Energis</strong>, 55p higher at 480p, <strong>Sage</strong>, up 33p to 300p, and <strong>Misys</strong>, 68.5p better at 623.5p. </p> <p>Lower down the corporate ladder, the pattern was much the same, with <strong>Bookham</strong>, up 104p to 932p, and <strong>Psion</strong>, gaining 27p to 270p, among the day's winners. </p> <p>Not that everything was going up, of course. Software group <strong>Autonomy</strong> fell 96p to \u00a313.10, hit by a profits warning from Inktomi, a US software outfit often compared to Autonomy of which it is in fact a customer. </p> <p>So-called defensive stocks were also having a rough time as investors rediscovered their appetite for risk. <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> fell 121p to \u00a317.36 and <strong> AstraZeneca</strong> lost 150p to \u00a331.90. Elsewhere, tobacco company <strong>BAT</strong> surrendered 46p to 480p, <strong>Tesco</strong> slipped 17p to 257p and <strong>Scottish Power</strong> fell 24p to 490p. </p> <p>Away from the leaders, a few leftovers from the pre-Christmas trading sessions were being reheated. Once again there was interest in rock crusher <strong>Aggregate Industries</strong>, up 1.5p to 80p, on speculation about a 95p bid on Monday. </p> <p>Pub operator - and one of the Guardian's tips of the year - <strong>SFI</strong> rose 19.5p to 192.5p after a stock overhang of 3.5m shares was cleared. Apparently, two heavyweight institutions were the buyers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There was no doubt about the topic of debate yesterday - the surprise rate cut from the US Federal Reserve. While analysts and traders were mulling over the implications, punters were concentrating on matters of a more speculative nature: in particular, the upward movement of Blue Circle's share price. On a day when many defensive issues were heading south, Blue Circle stood out with a gain of 17p to 455p in good volume. Throughout the session there had been a specific rumour driving the stock higher - namely that Lafarge, the French building materials group, is coming back with a new bid, apparently at around 495p to 500p. Last May, Lafarge made a 450p a share hostile bid for Blue Circle, which lapsed after the French group failed to attract enough acceptances for the deal to be unconditional. Although London's takeover rules prevent Lafarge from tabling another hostile bid until May it could, claim the gossips, strike an agreed deal and at the mooted price Blue Circle would probably accept. Given its healthy financial position - it recently sold its paint and mortar interests for around \u00a3500m - and the fact that it controls 32.2% of Blue Circle's equity, most analysts reckon that it is a question of when, not if, Lafarge resumes its pursuit. Unsurprisingly, the mood in the London market was brighter yesterday after the Federal Reserve's knight in shining armour performance. All the main indices moved higher during the day, with technology, media and telecom stocks faring the best. Underneath the market's euphoric response was more than a little disquiet. Yes, the FTSE 100 had risen 145.7 points to 6,185.6, and the FTSE Techmark 100 had put on 115.26 to 2,459.87 - but in both cases, the gains did little more than mask the losses sustained on Wednesday. Most did not know what to make of the Fed's action. On one hand it was clearly a good thing that the Fed had reacted to the slowing American economy, dealers said. But they pointed out that this rate cut - and any that follow - could take six months to filter through to the economy, in which time profits warnings will continue to roll in. Moreover, some thought the move smacked of desperation and pointed out that the Fed rarely acts between meetings and when it does - 1998, for instance - it is usually because something, somewhere, has gone badly wrong. Nonetheless, just about everything in the new technology world was heading higher. Colt Telecom was the pick of the bunch, rising 235p, or 18.22%, to \u00a315.25. Other strong performers included Energis, 55p higher at 480p, Sage, up 33p to 300p, and Misys, 68.5p better at 623.5p. Lower down the corporate ladder, the pattern was much the same, with Bookham, up 104p to 932p, and Psion, gaining 27p to 270p, among the day's winners. Not that everything was going up, of course. Software group Autonomy fell 96p to \u00a313.10, hit by a profits warning from Inktomi, a US software outfit often compared to Autonomy of which it is in fact a customer. So-called defensive stocks were also having a rough time as investors rediscovered their appetite for risk. GlaxoSmithKline fell 121p to \u00a317.36 and AstraZeneca lost 150p to \u00a331.90. Elsewhere, tobacco company BAT surrendered 46p to 480p, Tesco slipped 17p to 257p and Scottish Power fell 24p to 490p. Away from the leaders, a few leftovers from the pre-Christmas trading sessions were being reheated. Once again there was interest in rock crusher Aggregate Industries, up 1.5p to 80p, on speculation about a 95p bid on Monday. Pub operator - and one of the Guardian's tips of the year - SFI rose 19.5p to 192.5p after a stock overhang of 3.5m shares was cleared. Apparently, two heavyweight institutions were the buyers.",

Sharkey transposes the story to 18th-century London and the reign of George III, who is not yet mad but in Rupert Bates's lovely performance just deliciously dotty. Ella Humbleton's mother dies shortly after giving birth to her only daughter. Daughter grows up with a negligent father who spends his time shooting tigers in India, but when he marries for money, Ella finds her comfortable life transformed. She is forced to become the kitchen skivvy for the social climbing Lady Augusta and her daughters by her previous marriage, Charlotte and Euphronia Snifflewick. Or the Snifflers as they are better known. </p> <p>Sharkey has some particularly nice touches that, together with the neat script, lift this story above the ordinary. The Snifflewick girls are no ugly stepsisters - they are hideous only on the inside and the younger, Charlotte (delightfully played by Melissa Collier), shows some signs of redemption. There is no fairy godmother either: Ella's transformation is wrought not by magic but through her long dead mother, who is haunting the Humbleton residence. Then there is that carriage. </p> <p>In this version the pumpkin becomes a hot-air balloon that transports Ella to Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens where the king is giving a ball for his nephew, who is being forced to choose a wife. The rest is pretty much as you would both expect and desire, but the whole thing is executed in Erica Whyman's production with such flair that you can't help falling for it. All the performances are lovely but the production's trump card is Alison Pettitt's Ella, a tall, gawky girl with a smile so radiant she could melt an iceberg at a hundred paces. The prince falls for her, and so does every member of the audience. </p> <p>\u0095 Until January 20. Box office: 020-7620 3494.</p>",

This is neither a pantomime nor a children's show, but a piece of grown-up theatre. Sharkey transposes the story to 18th-century London and the reign of George III, who is not yet mad but in Rupert Bates's lovely performance just deliciously dotty. Ella Humbleton's mother dies shortly after giving birth to her only daughter. Daughter grows up with a negligent father who spends his time shooting tigers in India, but when he marries for money, Ella finds her comfortable life transformed. She is forced to become the kitchen skivvy for the social climbing Lady Augusta and her daughters by her previous marriage, Charlotte and Euphronia Snifflewick. Or the Snifflers as they are better known. Sharkey has some particularly nice touches that, together with the neat script, lift this story above the ordinary. The Snifflewick girls are no ugly stepsisters - they are hideous only on the inside and the younger, Charlotte (delightfully played by Melissa Collier), shows some signs of redemption. There is no fairy godmother either: Ella's transformation is wrought not by magic but through her long dead mother, who is haunting the Humbleton residence. Then there is that carriage. In this version the pumpkin becomes a hot-air balloon that transports Ella to Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens where the king is giving a ball for his nephew, who is being forced to choose a wife. The rest is pretty much as you would both expect and desire, but the whole thing is executed in Erica Whyman's production with such flair that you can't help falling for it. All the performances are lovely but the production's trump card is Alison Pettitt's Ella, a tall, gawky girl with a smile so radiant she could melt an iceberg at a hundred paces. The prince falls for her, and so does every member of the audience. \u0095 Until January 20. Box office: 020-7620 3494.",

In this hour-long play, Toby Farrow attempts to return the compliment by dramatising the events that lie contained within Hopper's celebrated 1949 canvas, Summer in the City. It seems an ingenious idea but the result locks the painting into a specific meaning and undercuts its mythic, open-ended suggestiveness. </p> <p>In the Hopper, a woman in a red dress squats moodily on the edge of a bed while behind her a man in grey boxer shorts lies with head buried in the pillow. Transposing the image from the US to Britain, Farrow offers us three possible interpretations of the scene. In one, a seriously ailing man is enjoying a furtive assignation with his brother's wife. In another, the red-dressed figure turns out to be a transvestite landlord who wants slightly more than the rent from his disgusted but nervously compliant tenant. And in the third, a woman has come to reclaim her traumatised soldier-husband while strenuously denying him sex. </p> <p>Last year Farrow wrote a highly promising play called Gringos - like this, seen at Bristol and BAC - based on his own backpacking experiences in South America. But here he has come up with a dryly conceptual play that, in deracinating Hopper, distorts him by imposing on him an alien gloom. In the words of Robert Hughes, the artist \"sensed, but did not agonise over, a profound solitude that lay below American optimism\". </p> <p>As if the Hopper influence were not enough, Farrow also seems to be writing three short playlets in the manner, respectively, of Harold Pinter, Joe Orton and Sarah Kane. The only one that really works is the central one, in which the blond-wigged landlord squanders any chance of escape to distant parts for the sake of a bit of quick nookie with his tenant: clearly, a boy in the hand is worth two in the bush. </p> <p>My conclusion is that paintings would be best left undramatised. The only time I remotely recall the process working was in David Pownall's Manet-inspired An Audience Called Edouard. Here, Martin Constantine's production for Lifetime Theatre does all it can to evoke memories of Hopper and there are decent performances from Grace Mattaka, Elizabeth Hurran and, not least, Danny Kerr as the draggy landlord. But the real place for Hopper's plangent, illuminated solitude is on gallery walls. </p> <p>\u0095 Until January 20. Box office: 020-7223 2223.</p>",
