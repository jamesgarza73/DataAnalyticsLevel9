      "body": "<p>It was while watching the corresponding fixture last season, when Blackburn somehow contrived to lose 1-0 after amassing 40 attempts on the visiting goal, that Graeme Souness decided the challenge awaiting him in East Lancashire was a suitably exacting one. </p> <p>Souness recalled: \"I'd been offered the job and I couldn't believe what I saw in that match. But I was keen to take it.\" </p> <p>Nine months on from the result that epitomised a traumatic season, Blackburn are third in the First Division with a game in hand on Bolton, who are second and three points ahead. They have lost only one of their past 15 league matches and currently look the best bet to claim second place in the one-horse race that Fulham have made of the Nationwide League. </p> <p>But Souness is not happy. His team, epitomised by the frustrating Matt Jansen, possess as much talent as most in the Premiership but their lack of killer instinct is alarming. </p> <p>This match was almost as one-sided as the one that Souness watched on television last March, and the hard work that Blackburn made of it told the manager that the progress he has overseen is not yet sufficient. \"We've just got to start punishing teams and putting them out of their misery,\" Souness said. \"I don't know quite how many we could have scored today but we could have sent our fans home very happy. I take blood-pressure tablets and, the way things are going, I'm going to have to ask my doctor to give me a stronger dose. </p> <p>\"We missed far too many chances and that's something we've got to improve on, if only to make it an easier afternoon for the staff and the supporters. But this was a potential banana skin for us and it was important we won.

      "bodyText": "It was while watching the corresponding fixture last season, when Blackburn somehow contrived to lose 1-0 after amassing 40 attempts on the visiting goal, that Graeme Souness decided the challenge awaiting him in East Lancashire was a suitably exacting one. Souness recalled: \"I'd been offered the job and I couldn't believe what I saw in that match. But I was keen to take it.\" Nine months on from the result that epitomised a traumatic season, Blackburn are third in the First Division with a game in hand on Bolton, who are second and three points ahead. They have lost only one of their past 15 league matches and currently look the best bet to claim second place in the one-horse race that Fulham have made of the Nationwide League. But Souness is not happy. His team, epitomised by the frustrating Matt Jansen, possess as much talent as most in the Premiership but their lack of killer instinct is alarming. This match was almost as one-sided as the one that Souness watched on television last March, and the hard work that Blackburn made of it told the manager that the progress he has overseen is not yet sufficient. \"We've just got to start punishing teams and putting them out of their misery,\" Souness said. \"I don't know quite how many we could have scored today but we could have sent our fans home very happy. I take blood-pressure tablets and, the way things are going, I'm going to have to ask my doctor to give me a stronger dose. \"We missed far too many chances and that's something we've got to improve on, if only to make it an easier afternoon for the staff and the supporters. But this was a potential banana skin for us and it was important we won. So far so good over the holiday programme, but having had to chase the game for such a long time might work against us at Norwich [today].\" Jansen accepted his share of the blame for the fact that Blackburn were not home and dry long before the 68th minute, when he finally made amends for a series of earlier misses. One in particular, when he somehow missed from three yards early in the second half, will live long in the memory. \"I had to score after missing that one,\" he said. Despite his profligacy in front of goal, the 23-year-old forward is finally showing signs that he can fulfil the talent that brought him to Sir Alex Ferguson's attention as a youngster with Carlisle. With Jansen at the heart of all Blackburn's attacks, Crewe never looked likely to repeat their victory here last season. The Crewe manager Dario Gradi said: \"All I can ask is for my team to show character. Our whole team only cost \u00a372,000, compared to Blackburn's millions, but my aim isn't to be as good as Blackburn. It's to be as good as we can be.\"",

      "body": "<p>The north-east may be frozen, gripped in the winter chill, but a warm United front swept through Tyneside on Saturday wearing Geordie black and white, not Mancunian red.</p> <p>Trailing to the best in the land, Bobby Robson's depleted troops rallied and plucked a deserved point to maintain the unlikeliest of European challenges. Such giddy ambition ignores the fact that injury has robbed them of Alan Shearer, their inspirational captain, and his \u00a37m strike partner Carl Cort. Furthermore their best full-back is absent without leave, their most experienced centre-half has put in a transfer request, and another lived up to his slapstick reputation by slipping on ice on Friday and limping back on to the treatment table. </p> <p>\"Yet we soldiered on and were never outplayed,\" said Robson. \"We had guys who threw themselves at shots and got us out of trouble when the result was on a knife's edge. Every one of our players gave a good, hard shift.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless Manchester United, whose mind-boggling squad papers over their own injury problems, were a class apart when they worked up steam. Andrew Griffin's clumsy challenge on Ryan Giggs earned them a first-half penalty, dispatched with ease by David Beckham, and thereafter they concentrated on soaking up Newcastle's feverish pressure and sweeping upfield on the break. Nicky Butt might have earned another spot-kick, and Steve Harper saved superbly from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer just before the hour. </p> <p>\"The only thing I'm disappointed with - apart from the performance, because I think we should be better than that - was that we had the chance to finish them off,\" said Sir Alex Ferguson. \"If we'd scored the second goal we'd have won the game comfortably. But it's a good point. Newcastle showed an incredible energy and desire, hunted every ball, fought for everything.\" </p> <p>The home side's refusal to submit undoubtedly merited a return. Shola Ameobi headed against a post and sliced horribly over an open goal; Kieron Dyer's arm-pumping zest and road-runner legs wore the visiting back line into the ground; and the irrepressible Nolberto Solano, feet twinkling with invention, was the game's outstanding talent, no mean feat given the opposition. </p> <p>Yet it took a brainwave from the bench to restore parity. With 16 minutes of the pulsating contest left, Robson introduced a trio of substitutes to replace weary limbs.

      "bodyText": "The north-east may be frozen, gripped in the winter chill, but a warm United front swept through Tyneside on Saturday wearing Geordie black and white, not Mancunian red. Trailing to the best in the land, Bobby Robson's depleted troops rallied and plucked a deserved point to maintain the unlikeliest of European challenges. Such giddy ambition ignores the fact that injury has robbed them of Alan Shearer, their inspirational captain, and his \u00a37m strike partner Carl Cort. Furthermore their best full-back is absent without leave, their most experienced centre-half has put in a transfer request, and another lived up to his slapstick reputation by slipping on ice on Friday and limping back on to the treatment table. \"Yet we soldiered on and were never outplayed,\" said Robson. \"We had guys who threw themselves at shots and got us out of trouble when the result was on a knife's edge. Every one of our players gave a good, hard shift.\" Nevertheless Manchester United, whose mind-boggling squad papers over their own injury problems, were a class apart when they worked up steam. Andrew Griffin's clumsy challenge on Ryan Giggs earned them a first-half penalty, dispatched with ease by David Beckham, and thereafter they concentrated on soaking up Newcastle's feverish pressure and sweeping upfield on the break. Nicky Butt might have earned another spot-kick, and Steve Harper saved superbly from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer just before the hour. \"The only thing I'm disappointed with - apart from the performance, because I think we should be better than that - was that we had the chance to finish them off,\" said Sir Alex Ferguson. \"If we'd scored the second goal we'd have won the game comfortably. But it's a good point. Newcastle showed an incredible energy and desire, hunted every ball, fought for everything.\" The home side's refusal to submit undoubtedly merited a return. Shola Ameobi headed against a post and sliced horribly over an open goal; Kieron Dyer's arm-pumping zest and road-runner legs wore the visiting back line into the ground; and the irrepressible Nolberto Solano, feet twinkling with invention, was the game's outstanding talent, no mean feat given the opposition. Yet it took a brainwave from the bench to restore parity. With 16 minutes of the pulsating contest left, Robson introduced a trio of substitutes to replace weary limbs. Seven minutes later Daniel Cordone broke down the right, Lomano Lua-Lua scuffed his shot across the six-yard box and Stephen Glass, unmarked at the far post, slammed the ball past Fabien Barthez. Sitting pretty in seventh place, Robson may now hope to persuade those dissident voices in his squad to remain true to the Toon. His goalscorer is a free agent in the summer and is free to sign a pre-contract agreement elsewhere. \"But we want Glass to stay,\" said the manager. \"It's the same with Alain Goma; if he tells me he's changed his mind and wants to be taken off the transfer list we'll stop looking for centre-halves.\" The French defender, called into the squad earlier in the day when Marcelino was ruled out after his fall, was a defensive colossus throughout. \"I don't understand why we haven't had an offer because he's a top player, he's class.\" Robson was disappointed, too, at failing to secure the Barcelona striker Dani on loan in Shearer's long absence. \"I'm happy at Barca even though I'm not playing.

      "bodyText": "It has been a horrendous end to 2000 for Dundee United. First, their manager, Paul Sturrock, resigned amid alarmingly early signs that his team were decrepit. Then their chairman, Jim McLean, also resigned following an incident with a BBC reporter. On Saturday at Easter Road, United discovered that even when referees make errors of judgment, they are fated to be the side that suffers. United, with a paltry seven points from 23 Premier League games, thought their gritty show of defiance against Hibernian was going to earn them a point. By the 97th minute, it certainly seemed that a goalless draw would be the outcome. But Alex Smith, United's manager, reckoned without a reckless impulse that overcame the referee, Alan Freeland. Television footage confirmed that Freeland had not actually witnessed what he imagined he had when he awarded Hibs a last-gasp penalty after Craig Easton's collision with Matthias Jack. Easton's foot scarcely made contact with Jack's ankle at a corner, and was completely accidental, but Jack's reaction as he hobbled away convinced the referee that a penalty should be given. It was the cruellest twist for United when Russell Latapy calmy converted past Alan Combe with only five seconds remaining. This sparked heated protests from United's players and Combe is certain to be in trouble with the SFA following his aggressive behaviour towards a linesman as he sprinted from the field at the final whistle. On a weekend when the schedule was virtually obliterated by snow, the only other SPL encounter was at McDiarmid Park, where St Johnstone and Hearts drew 2-2. Andy Kirk and Gordon Durie scored Hearts' goals on either side of two from the home side - first, spectacularly, from Momo Sylla, then from Paddy Connolly. The Celtic manager Martin O'Neill has said that he wants the Slovakian international Lubomir Moravcik to consider remaining at Parkhead for another season. Moravcik, now 35, had suggested he would retire from football at the end of this season, but O'Neill is keen for him to stay on. \"He's a player of fantastic skills and he deserves to be around for another season,\" the manager said.",

The 70-year-old princess was told to stay in bed over Christmas and the New Year and is still awaiting test results. Margaret was seen by a doctor twice over the weekend. Buckingham Palace would not discuss the medical tests.\"She is continuing to rest at Sandringham, where she has nursing care available to her,\" a spokeswoman said. Margaret, the Queen's younger sister, was absent from the Royal Family's Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services at Sandringham and the Palace said she was \"feeling tired\". The nature of the medical tests is confidential, but doctors hope they will pinpoint the princess's illness. She has not been admitted to hospital and is expected to remain at Sandringham, the Queen's Norfolk estate, for the foreseeable future. The People newspaper claimed that the princess was missing from the royal festivities because she was depressed. The paper said it was so bad that she refused to leave Sandringham on Christmas Day to join the rest of her family at church. It was claimed that Margaret was spending up to two weeks at a time in bed in the \"depths of despair\" and was so depressed she had \"lost the will to live\". Margaret had lost her appetite and experienced violent mood swings, the paper said. The princess was last seen in public in November at a London Ballet gala evening. Margaret, who normally lives at Kensington Palace, suffered serious burns to her legs and feet in an accident while on holiday in the Caribbean during March 1999. The previous year, also on the island of Mustique, she suffered a stroke. Margaret is said to have given up smoking after a part of her lung was removed in 1985.",

The couple had seen in the New Year at a restaurant in London's West End and were leaving when the attack happened at 12.30am. Police said an argument involving racist language developed between the Algerian and a man on the street. With his wife by his side, the 38-year-old victim was stabbed repeatedly in the head, neck and chest, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said. He was today \"critical\" in intensive care at a London hospital. Police said they were treating the attack - on the corner of Old Compton Street and Greek Street, Soho - as racially-motivated attempted murder and were hunting a black man seen running from the scene. He was described as aged 26 to 28 and about 5ft 6ins to 5ft 8ins tall. It is understood the suspect's face was injured during the confrontation. Police appealed for witnesses - one of whom is believed to have videotaped the attack - to contact the incident room on 020 7437 1212 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.",

      "bodyText": "American diplomats privately accused world leaders of being \"tepid\" in their support for the so-called war against drugs, according to a US presidential briefing paper obtained by the Guardian. The internal document reveals how Washington sought to rally leading governments behind an audacious UN plan to halt drug abuse. The long-running US-led \"war against drugs\" has often been criticised by sceptical governments and other critics as a mission doomed to fail and a waste of money. The briefing paper was written by American diplomats in the run-up to a landmark UN summit which adopted a huge, two-pronged plan - to eradicate the production of illegal drugs in the world by 2008 and to cut down significantly the number of people who wanted to take drugs by 2003. A key stepping stone towards that summit in June 1998 was another summit - this time of the G8 leaders - which was held in Britain three weeks beforehand. In a briefing paper to aides of the US president, Bill Clinton, state department officials wrote that the crucial US goal was to \"send a strong message that the G8 will continue a vigorous fight against international production, trafficking and abuse of illicit drugs\". The US was keen to secure international backing for the wide-ranging plans of Pino Arlacchi, who had been recently appointed executive director of the UN drug control programme (UNDCP). Mr Arlacchi, who had previously helped to fight the Mafia in Italy, was seen to have shaken up the organisation. He was committed to an approach that moved beyond the usual methods of merely catching drug smugglers. But the state department officials noted in their paper that \"other G8 governments have given only tepid and circumscribed support to the UNDCP\". They added: \"We understand other governments' cautious reaction to Pino Arlacchi's ambitious plan for a global attack on illicit drug cultivations, especially coca and opium poppy.\" \"We all know, as does Mr Arlacchi, that the cost of such a programme must be carefully considered. The obstacles to eliminating drugs cultivations are daunting in Afghanistan and Burma, for example.\" These two countries are responsible for growing the vast majority of the opium used to produce heroin. Mr Arlacchi wanted to step up the destruction of the illicit drug plantations, but this could only be done with the compliance of the two governments. Officials were aware there would be political opposition to the idea of giving money to the Taliban in Afghanistan and the dictatorship in Burma. \"Nevertheless the UNDCP's ambitious plan for a global approach to target drug crops is on the right track; it builds on our combined experience with alternative development, eradication, and enforcement; it targets all major cultivations simultaneously so that production does not simply shift from one country to another,\" wrote the American officials. The internal paper was released to the Guardian under the US freedom of information act. It also gives an insight into the high-level politicking which goes into the drafting of communiques issued at international summits.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This would be nobody's idea of a golden age for the hatchback. Where once Golfs proudly roamed the land looking very young and pleased with themselves, the fun now seems to be elsewhere and the Golf has come to seem, certainly in its new form, a little clumpy and outstripped, just one of the cluster of impersonal, interchangeable and deeply unexciting blobs which characterise the hatchback sector. </p> <p>Elsewhere, people who might once have gone for a hatchback are excitedly bombing about in newly affordable combat vehicles and miniature people carriers which, despite miniaturisation, still have enough room for the children in the back to watch movies, play five-a-side football and have friends over to stay. Meanwhile, all the poor old hatchback can do is hunker down and try to sound enthusiastic while saying: \"Look, if you put the rear seats down, you can get four sacks of garden rubbish inside me.\" Fashion can be cruel like that. </p> <p>Periodically, though, a hatchback noses its way to the front of this uneasy and quietly lowing herd and makes a claim to be thought dynamic. The Ford Focus was one example and the new Honda Civic is another. It is a stern corrective for anyone who still thinks anything made by Honda should, by rights, be a motorbike. </p> <p>It is less flashy than the Focus (which, for all its brilliance, does still smack slightly of a design seminar staffed by men with ponytails) and more appealing in many other respects. Things that tend now to feel like a drag about hatchbacks in general somehow appear to be pert virtues in the Civic. </p> <p>It seems modest rather than merely anodyne, crisply practical rather than merely boring. It is too much, perhaps, to expect it single-handedly to turn the tide against its heartily established, non-hatchback rivals. At the same time, you look at the Civic and wonder anew what the fuss is, really, about MPVs and Jeep-alikes. And it has a cute bonnet too. </p> <p>It is unusually roomy, despite taking up little space on the road. Dr Who would be impressed. You can sit in the back without having your knees plugged into your ears; and you can get out of the back without assistance from other people and winches. The result of this emphasis is that there is less boot-space than you might get from other hatchbacks. But this simply means that Honda is placing the needs of humans above sacks of garden rubbish, which cannot be an entirely bad thing. </p> <p>Honda refers to the Civic's \"walk-through interior\", which, in the context, is ambitious. I would like to see someone try it. The point is, though, that movement around the car is entirely unhampered by lumps in the floor. It's the world's first open-plan hatchback. </p> <p>Even the gear stick is removed to the dashboard, in the manner of ancient Citro\u00ebns, making it altogether easier to climb on top of the passenger next to you, should you need to for any reason. I think we can safely say that, in the matter of space distribution, Honda has thought of everything here. </p> <p>The gear fob looks a little comical up there on the dash; something like the control from a long since outmoted arcade video game. But, though it feels peculiar to be fiddling about regularly on the dashboard with something which isn't the controls for the radio, I grew to love it and particularly the short distance it affords between gears, which are, highly satisfyingly, just a click apart and which made the sensation of driving the car actually quite sporty. </p> <p>You can sling the car about a bit, too, without enduring muscular-skeletal damage. According to the Honda literature, \"ride comfort has been improved by reducing the spring rates of the front and rear compliance bushings\". I think we can all be grateful to them for that, even those of us who don't know our rear compliance bushing from our elbow. </p> <p>The problem with most hatchbacks driven at speed is the noise. It is like perching inside an air-extraction unit; you emerge afterwards feeling deafened and stupid.

      "bodyText": "This would be nobody's idea of a golden age for the hatchback. Where once Golfs proudly roamed the land looking very young and pleased with themselves, the fun now seems to be elsewhere and the Golf has come to seem, certainly in its new form, a little clumpy and outstripped, just one of the cluster of impersonal, interchangeable and deeply unexciting blobs which characterise the hatchback sector. Elsewhere, people who might once have gone for a hatchback are excitedly bombing about in newly affordable combat vehicles and miniature people carriers which, despite miniaturisation, still have enough room for the children in the back to watch movies, play five-a-side football and have friends over to stay. Meanwhile, all the poor old hatchback can do is hunker down and try to sound enthusiastic while saying: \"Look, if you put the rear seats down, you can get four sacks of garden rubbish inside me.\" Fashion can be cruel like that. Periodically, though, a hatchback noses its way to the front of this uneasy and quietly lowing herd and makes a claim to be thought dynamic. The Ford Focus was one example and the new Honda Civic is another. It is a stern corrective for anyone who still thinks anything made by Honda should, by rights, be a motorbike. It is less flashy than the Focus (which, for all its brilliance, does still smack slightly of a design seminar staffed by men with ponytails) and more appealing in many other respects. Things that tend now to feel like a drag about hatchbacks in general somehow appear to be pert virtues in the Civic. It seems modest rather than merely anodyne, crisply practical rather than merely boring. It is too much, perhaps, to expect it single-handedly to turn the tide against its heartily established, non-hatchback rivals. At the same time, you look at the Civic and wonder anew what the fuss is, really, about MPVs and Jeep-alikes. And it has a cute bonnet too. It is unusually roomy, despite taking up little space on the road. Dr Who would be impressed. You can sit in the back without having your knees plugged into your ears; and you can get out of the back without assistance from other people and winches. The result of this emphasis is that there is less boot-space than you might get from other hatchbacks. But this simply means that Honda is placing the needs of humans above sacks of garden rubbish, which cannot be an entirely bad thing. Honda refers to the Civic's \"walk-through interior\", which, in the context, is ambitious. I would like to see someone try it. The point is, though, that movement around the car is entirely unhampered by lumps in the floor. It's the world's first open-plan hatchback. Even the gear stick is removed to the dashboard, in the manner of ancient Citro\u00ebns, making it altogether easier to climb on top of the passenger next to you, should you need to for any reason. I think we can safely say that, in the matter of space distribution, Honda has thought of everything here. The gear fob looks a little comical up there on the dash; something like the control from a long since outmoted arcade video game. But, though it feels peculiar to be fiddling about regularly on the dashboard with something which isn't the controls for the radio, I grew to love it and particularly the short distance it affords between gears, which are, highly satisfyingly, just a click apart and which made the sensation of driving the car actually quite sporty. You can sling the car about a bit, too, without enduring muscular-skeletal damage. According to the Honda literature, \"ride comfort has been improved by reducing the spring rates of the front and rear compliance bushings\". I think we can all be grateful to them for that, even those of us who don't know our rear compliance bushing from our elbow. The problem with most hatchbacks driven at speed is the noise. It is like perching inside an air-extraction unit; you emerge afterwards feeling deafened and stupid. Surely only someone with a relaxed attitude to the future of their hearing would wish to engage in an extended bout of high-speed overtaking in a hatchback. But even here Honda comes good. No one would suggest that the Civic offers whisper-quiet motoring in the manner of a Rolls-Royce, but at the same time it did, in motorway conditions, sound less like a hand-held vacuum cleaner than other cars of its shape and size. The Civic comes with the usual slew of toys which, until relatively recently, would only have appeared in heavyweight saloons but which now appear everywhere as a matter of course - electric windows, heated mirrors, air conditioning units, hot and cold-running CD players, etc. Extras are the new standards. Soon, in order to distinguish themselves from each other, cars will have to start giving away extraneous white goods: dishwashers, fridge-freezers and so forth. In addition, because this is its first month on sale, the Civic is currently available at challenging launch prices. But it is not the kind of car that needs toys and discounts to speak for it. It can stand on its own.

It has been brewing for months but nothing, not even the midst of the recent bloodletting, has matched the new sense of raw anger and foreboding. At the heart of the crisis is the malignancy which has infected the region ever since Israel captured the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1967: the systematic colonisation of the occupied territories by militant Jewish settlers. Close on 200,000 have staked out claims on Palestinian land, builting garish hilltop townships and lording it over the local population. The settler movement has been encouraged by rightwing Israeli governments and tolerated by leftwing ones. Subsidised by wealthy overseas Zionists and urged on by militant nationalists, both religious and secular, the process of colonial expansion has been relentless - and frequently violent. The inchoate rage of the Palestinians since the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948 has found, since 1967, a focus for anger in the successive waves of settlement spreading across their ancestral lands. Now, as the latest intifada, (uprising) intensifies, it is the conflict between the Palestinians and the settlers, the colonised and the colonisers, which is at the heart of the ancient confrontation. On New Year's Eve, militant settler Binhamin Kahane and his wife Talia were ambushed and killed in their car. Their five daughters were wounded. It is not known whether the couple was specifically targeted, nor is it known whether Thabet Thabet, a prominent local leader of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, was deliberately gunned down in retaliation for Kahane murders. But assassinated he was, by Israeli security forces, barely three hours after the Kahanes died. Overnight four more Palestinians were killed, including a 10-year-old boy and two policemen. The overall intifada death toll now stands at 356, of whom 40 were Israeli security forces or civilians. But the statistics are irrelevant: in the new phase of confrontation what matters is blind, passionate hatred. Militant settlers are marching on Jerusalem today to demand greater security - which for many of them means expelling the Palestinians from their native land. Fatah officials are talking of mounting their own march on Jerusalem to take it back from the Israelis. Neither demonstration carries much military significance, for the Israeli army will simply brush aside either if it becomes dangerous. But both marches embody the rising mood of almost hysterical fear and loathing in both communities. Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak has today repeated his dire warning to the Palestinians that they will suffer if the peace process finally break down. Most onlookers would be forgiven for believing the process is already dead and buried. There is a school of thought, however, that the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships will only be forced into making the concessions which are self-evidently vital if there is ever to be a lasting peace, by a truly gigantic crisis. That crisis could now be upon us.

Only now, for example, can we learn from the official papers a fascinating insight into the career of a rising young journalist in 1970 - one Jonathan Aitken. The budding reporter Aitken made a bit of name for himself with his informed insights into the Nigerian civil war. It emerges that he was given a report by a general on the observer team monitoring the war, on a strictly confidential basis. Prime minister Heath was told that when the document was returned, the general noticed that the staple fastening it appeared to have been removed and re-attached. \"When asked about this,\" the report laconically notes, \"Aitken denied that he had taken copies\". Another eye-catching gobbet of information, long since past its sell-by date but still of socio-historical interest, is that Margaret Thatcher, on becoming Education Secretary in Heath's cabinet, was so keen to bang the cost-cutting drum that she slashed the department budget by even more than the Treasury had demanded. In her zeal she even proposed introducing modest charges for borrowing public library books - but quickly retreated when told that such a move would be wildly unpopular. Now maybe, just maybe, the government needs to conduct its business out of the glare of publicity (except of course when it deems that publicity beneficial). But do we really have to wait a full generation to find out that a cabinet minister seriously proposed to charge us for reading our own books? Do we not need such information to judge the quality of that minister, that government? The authorities, of course, believe we are better kept in ignorance. Freedom of Information is a great slogan, but the current legislation of that name is so cratered with loopholes and get-out clauses, that it would perhaps be more honestly called the Freedom From Information Bill.

An estimated 70,000 partygoers braved freezing temperatures to celebrate the stroke of midnight in Trafalgar Square, central London. Another 100,000 braved the weather to pack the centre of Edinburgh for the city's traditional Hogmanay celebrations. But some parts of the British Isles woke up to a wet New Year with severe flooding and flood warnings as warmer weather began melting the snow and more heavy rain was forecast. The environment agency issued 35 flood warnings on rivers in the south west and another eight across the midlands and south of England. The River Axe in Devon burst its banks in the early hours and washed away a bridge on the A358. A firefighter had to be rescued when he was stranded by fast flowing water as he tried to save a man trapped by the water. Six more firefighters had to be rescued by lifeboat from their fire engine near Stranraer, Ayrshire, after it become stuck in floods. Three people were also rescued from rising floodwater in east Cornwall after the driver of a stranded car called the emergency services on his mobile phone, police said. In Dorset, all the main roads were flooded but police said they were still passable. Drivers were warned of \"treacherous\" conditions on roads in the Highlands and, in Dumfries and Galloway, the main A77 road was under 4ft of water. Driving wind and rain failed to dampen the spirit of up to 10,000 partygoers at a countdown concert in Birmingham, but Liverpool and Londonderry cancelled their celebrations last night following a severe weather warning from the Met Office. They were followed by Stirling, Brighton and Hove and Middlesbrough, while freezing conditions forced council leaders in Bristol to scale down their celebrations. Elsewhere, revellers wrapped up warm to brave sub-zero temperatures, strong winds and blizzards. The bad weather also brought tragedy. Treacherous driving conditions claimed the life of a man at Maudlin, near Bodmin, Cornwall, when his Ford Sierra struck a wall on an icy country road. The body of a man in his 30s was also discovered on Sunday near a beauty spot by a walker in the Sunnyhurst area of Darwen, Lancs. In Scotland, a climber died on New Year's Eve after falling 100ft off Ben Nevis in Scotland, and another rescue attempt was launched for a second climber stranded on the peak.

Progress is being made. Last week the homelessness charity Shelter said that the numbers of rough sleepers in British cities and towns had dropped by around a third this year. </p> <p>The director of Shelter, Chris Holmes, said: \"Over the last year, through the rough sleepers' strategy and the work of voluntary agencies, the number of rough sleepers has been reduced by about a third, but it hasn't in central London, where the problems are most visible and worst.\" </p> <p>Crucial to reducing numbers is persuading the most long term street sleepers to exchange their pavements for warm beds; a job which is more difficult than it sounds. </p> <p>A leading homelessness charity, Crisis, has voiced fears that street workers are concentrating on those who are easiest to help in an effort to hit government targets. </p> <p>At a recent conference, the Crisis chief executive, Shaks Ghosh, claimed that some of the most vulnerable people on the streets - in particular the \"entrenched\", mostly male, rough sleepers who have been on the road for years and often have serious mental health and addiction problems - were being ignored because they had the greatest needs. </p> <p>\"They need to know that we will not turn our backs on them simply because they present us with the greatest challenge,\" she said. </p> <p>The charities which run the street level contact and assessment (CAT) teams were stung by the criticism, and pointed out that persuading men like Peter, Stuart and Alexander to come in from the cold was no straightforward task. </p> <p>All three men are clients of the homeless housing association Thames Reach, whose chief executive, Jeremy Swain, said that Peter was on a waiting list for a flat and should be housed in the next month. </p> <p>Stuart's situation is, with cruel irony, more difficult because he has a job. \"It's an illustration of the problem we have with London rents,\" Mr Swain said. \"A lot of Stuart's money would be taken off him to go towards his housing because he wouldn't get much housing benefit. It's a very difficult situation.\" </p> <p>The hope is that Stuart will be eligible for help from another homeless charity which could lend him a deposit for a cheap private flat. </p> <p>Alexander's case is even less clearcut; he appears to derive genuine enjoyment from his outdoor existence, in which he supports himself by collecting street bric-a-brac and selling it from a stall at Portobello market, in west London. </p> <p>Mr Swain believes he will eventually accept an offer of housing, but for now Thames Reach workers are concentrating on building up a relationship of trust with him. </p> <p>The stepping stones to getting people like him housed include encouraging him to accept state help, such as unemployment benefit and NHS care. </p> <p>There was an early illustration of how difficult all this can be when Natalie Lodge, an outreach worker for the charity, was late for our meeting. She had been negotiating with a homeless man, 56, and on the streets for 21 years, who was threatening to walk out of the hostel where he had been staying four days. </p> <p>\"His benefits weren't sorted out,\" said Natalie. She managed to calm him down, reassuring him that he would be able to claim benefits. </p> <p>Her work can be dangerous. One man, a heavy drinker and so aggressive that no hostel will take him, lashes out at her almost every time she goes near him. Once he chased her down the street. </p> <p>Many of her clients have been spewed out by the care system, or are exiles of family breakdown, escaping from physical and sexual abuse. They are scared of help. </p> <p>\"It's because the system has let them down,\" Natalie said. \"If people have been in care or been abused by their parents, they haven't got trust in anybody.\" </p> <p>The bravado of the homeless men she met could be a mask for grim personal stories, she said. </p> <p>For all his bonhomie, it is evident that Peter has a serious drink problem. He swigs heavily from a Stella as we talk, and tells us about the other morning, when he downed two bottles of whisky soon after he woke up. </p> <p>He may be the kind of rough sleeper that the chief executive of Crisis has in mind when she claims that the contact and assessment teams are failing the vulnerable. </p> <p>\"I was out with our mobile health unit,\" Ms Ghosh said. \"I spoke to dozens of people with very severe health needs; with terrible depression, people who were detoxing. And they couldn't get access to beds. </p> <p>\"The homeless guys on the street are saying that they have to be seen three times in the same place by the same CAT worker before they can get access to the system.\" </p> <p>Mr Swain argued that Crisis had got it wrong. He said that there were only a limited number of hostel beds available to his staff each night, and that putting people into hostels was not always the answer. </p> <p>Evidently, some homeless people, such as Peter and Stuart, have no desire to go into hostels but prefer to sleep rough until they can move into a home of their own, but the most vulnerable rough sleepers are always a priority. </p> <p>\"If a 15-year-old with drug problems, somebody who's extremely vulnerable, comes on to the streets tonight we can get them off straight away. </p> <p>\"We would get social services involved, do whatever it takes. But for some people it may not be best to go into a central London hostel. </p> <p>\"If we are dealing with a 16-year-old who has come down from Stoke, the aim may not be to get him into a hostel, but to get him home,\" Mr Swain added. </p> <p>\"The risk is that in a hostel he could get involved with young people taking drugs, who would teach him the tricks of being on the street.\" </p> <p>Peter, Stuart and Alexander will have seen in the new year under the stars.

But since library charges \"could be unpopular\", she asked for cabinet endorsement. \"Considerable concern\" was expressed about the impact of higher school meals charges. Two weeks later, the idea of ending a free public library service was quietly dropped, after a flurry of Whitehall negotiations. Lord Eccles, arts minister, was brought to cabinet to explain that charges would be \"difficult to defend since [they] represented a volte face in Conservative policy\" and would attract a meagre revenue.",

      "bodyText": "Edward Heath was pushed by the US into exchanging the iconic Palestinian guerrilla fighter Leila Khaled for dozens of western hostages after the world's most spectacular multiple aircraft hijacking in September 1970. Khaled was at the centre of a crisis sparked by the seizure of five civilian airliners by the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The PFLP blew up three of the aircraft for the television cameras at a disused RAF airstrip in the Jordanian desert, and 56 US and European passengers were used to bargain for the release of seven Palestinian prisoners in Britain, Germany and Switzerland. One was Khaled, who had been handed over to the British authorities at Heathrow after an attempt to commandeer an El Al flight was foiled and her fellow hijacker, Patrick Arguello, a Nicaraguan, was shot dead by Israeli guards. The decision to trade Khaled three weeks later was criticised by the Tory right and defended by Heath supporters on the grounds that prosecution might have failed because of a lack of evidence that the hijack attempt took place over British soil. But the state papers show that Heath told the cabinet less than three days after her capture that he had \"acquiesced in a US proposal authorising the Red Cross to offer the release of Leila Khaled, together with the terrorists held by the Swiss and German authorities, in exchange for the hostages and aircraft held at Dawson's Field\". Heath's personal file - which occupies more than 50 pages of cabinet minutes - includes a letter written by Khaled, from Ealing police station in west London, to her mother, describing her routine and promising to \"return soon\". She was treated well,\"as if I were an official state guest\", she wrote, adding: \"I do not worry about myself... The only thing that grieves and hurts me today is that I am not now carrying arms and am not sharing with my people in the battle.\" Khaled, who later became a member of the Palestinian parliament and now lives in Amman, was referring to the war then erupting in Jordan between King Hussein's army and the increasingly powerful Palestinian resistance. In a confidential annex, an astonished Heath told his cabinet that King Hussein had appealed through Britain's ambassador in Amman \"for an air strike by Israel\". In discussion with the ambassador, King Hussein described Colonel Muammar Gadafy, president of Libya, as a \"nutcase\" and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as a \"criminal\".",

      "body": "<p>The last issue of the Architectural Review was a treasure trove. Here was a church built by villagers in rural Bolivia, made of timber and plastic sheeting and designed by a young woman straight out of college. Here was a public lavatory designed for a Japanese park, as much public artwork as public convenience. Another page revealed a stylish house built on a sand dune. Then there was a superb mobile home named Fred, an animated viewing platform on a Norwegian mountain top, an idyllic Finnish sauna and the intriguing new Finnish Embassy in Berlin ... </p> <p>This magical collection was brought together by the magazine's annual award, aimed at encouraging emerging talent throughout the world. What makes this award worthwhile is that it is truly global and the jury appears to be free of stylistic prejudices. Most architectural awards, whether for building of the year or best young talent, do little more than round up the usual suspects: yet another Dutch housing scheme designed by an earnest young devotee of Rem Koolhaas; some white box house extension that could have been designed at almost any time over the past 70 years. </p> <p>This award could hardly be more different. The jury brought together architects Odile Decq (France), Will Bruder (US), Adalberto Dias (Portugal), Christoph Ingenhoven (Germany), Erick van Egeraat (Netherlands) and Peter Davey, editor of the Architectural Review, as chairman. The judges were big-spirited enough to choose as joint winners of the \u00a310,000 prize Jae Cha's self-build church at Urubo, Bolivia, alongside Shuhei Endo's public lavatories in Japan's Hyogo Prefecture and an inflatable pretzel-like wall by Mark Dytham and Astrid Klein fronting a building site in Tokyo. </p> <p>The award drew more than 700 entries from more than 60 countries. This is impressive, although it does mean the judges would have visited few of the buildings they had to consider. Yet while it's true that no final judgment should be made until a building has been experienced in the round, photographs and drawings can at least reveal those that are likely to be most inventive and delightful. The qualities the judges were looking for were, according to Davey, \"courage, the ability to make some change for the good with the least input of resources, the use of materials in ways proper to the nature, and the expression of a desire to enhance human existence\". </p> <p>A tall order? Maybe. But just look at the church that Jae Cha has designed in Bolivia. Using cheap pressure-treated timber and sheets of corrugated translucent polycarbonate (stuff that you come across in any serious builders' merchant) and gathering these in two circles - an outer and an inner wall - she has, in the judges' words, \"managed to conjure an intense feeling of the numinous. The work is the more powerful because it was partly designed by the architect on site, when the exact positioning of the translucent sheets was determined.\" </p> <p>This was so that the fall of light inside the building could be determined. This was not only to prevent glare while ensuring there was sufficient light inside, but to allow light and shade to record the movements of the sun, like a kind of Catholic Stonehenge. The church is circular and archetypal in its geometric simplicity. It also promises to be quietly beautiful even after sunset, when soft light glows out through those translucent walls. </p> <p>So often in Britain we try to make cheap buildings look fancy. We can't help tacking on decorative details to pretend a car park is some sort of Victorian civic palace or a cynically built cul-de-sac house an exercise in late-flowering Palladian design. The most moving, as opposed to entertaining, buildings are nearly always those that have integrity, whatever their style. And when there is little money to spend, simplicity is undoubtedly a virtue, although, as Cha's church proves, that need not mean keeping a lid on the imagination. </p> <p>Far from it. Equally simple in its way is Fred, the decidedly cute mobile home invented by Austrian architect Oskar Kaufmann. \"Everyone on the jury fell for Fred,\" says Davey. \"He (or it) has a cheeky personality that seems capable of adaptation to almost any social and topographical location.\" Or, as Kaufmann puts it, \"Call your trucker and next day you can live somewhere else.\" Ah, if only. Although Fred looks very smart in a chic way, he is also perfectly green, being well insulated and made almost entirely of appropriately resourced wood. Water can be gathered from the roof for the shower and lavatory. </p> <p>Fred arrives on location as a 3 metre cube package. Settled down, whether on the deck or on stilts, he can be expanded telescopically and offers a bathroom, kitchen and sleeping area and large, handsome windows. \"Fred,\" say the judges, \"is much more elegant and unobtrusive than a typical trailer, and he could make a very great difference to the coastlines of much of Europe\", disfigured as they are by insensitive trailer parks and other forms of wilfully naff cheap accommodation. Fred is probably a little too sophisticated (ie, expensive) to serve as a home for refugees from natural disasters in poor parts of the world; he would, however, make a fine building block for barrios, favelas and townships. If I had a garden, I'd give Fred a home; he would make a great guest wing or writing studio. </p> <p>As for the two Japanese projects, both are great fun and utterly unexpected. Public toilets are usually horrid things tucked away behind evergreen hedges because they are an embarrassment. Not so Shuhei Endo's lavatories and park-keeper's hut. This is a brilliant, unabashed swirl of galvanised corrugated metal, its loops and spirals derived from the structural logic of this malleable material. Endo calls this enjoyable design exercise \"springtecture\". It's certainly jaunty and doubtless well worth spending a yen to see. </p> <p>Mark Dytham and Astrid Klein's temporary \"Pika Pika Pretzel Wall\" stretches 34m along Omotesando, \"Tokyo's Champs Elys\u00e9es\". There have been a lot of building site hoardings along the Omotesando recently, most of them detracting from the admittedly higgledy-piggledy streetscape. </p> <p>Here was a chance to transform a basic utility into a playful architectural adventure, one that would make people smile. Made of the same high-tech fabric used in the construction of high-altitude balloons, the pretzel wall lights up internally at night. As Davey notes, many of the designs favoured by the judges in this year's award are temporary or subject to change. \"Perhaps\", he adds, \"there is something about transience that brings out edge in design.\" </p> <p>Certainly these schemes by young professionals are encouraging in that they prove that architects still know how to experiment with materials for their and our delight. The awards also show how the best young architects at the beginning of the 21st century, whether they come from rich or poor countries, can offer basic, cheap buildings that nevertheless have the power to raise the spirit and ennoble those who use them. The future really does look good.</p>",

Using cheap pressure-treated timber and sheets of corrugated translucent polycarbonate (stuff that you come across in any serious builders' merchant) and gathering these in two circles - an outer and an inner wall - she has, in the judges' words, \"managed to conjure an intense feeling of the numinous. The work is the more powerful because it was partly designed by the architect on site, when the exact positioning of the translucent sheets was determined.\" This was so that the fall of light inside the building could be determined. This was not only to prevent glare while ensuring there was sufficient light inside, but to allow light and shade to record the movements of the sun, like a kind of Catholic Stonehenge. The church is circular and archetypal in its geometric simplicity. It also promises to be quietly beautiful even after sunset, when soft light glows out through those translucent walls. So often in Britain we try to make cheap buildings look fancy. We can't help tacking on decorative details to pretend a car park is some sort of Victorian civic palace or a cynically built cul-de-sac house an exercise in late-flowering Palladian design. The most moving, as opposed to entertaining, buildings are nearly always those that have integrity, whatever their style. And when there is little money to spend, simplicity is undoubtedly a virtue, although, as Cha's church proves, that need not mean keeping a lid on the imagination. Far from it. Equally simple in its way is Fred, the decidedly cute mobile home invented by Austrian architect Oskar Kaufmann. \"Everyone on the jury fell for Fred,\" says Davey. \"He (or it) has a cheeky personality that seems capable of adaptation to almost any social and topographical location.\" Or, as Kaufmann puts it, \"Call your trucker and next day you can live somewhere else.\" Ah, if only. Although Fred looks very smart in a chic way, he is also perfectly green, being well insulated and made almost entirely of appropriately resourced wood. Water can be gathered from the roof for the shower and lavatory. Fred arrives on location as a 3 metre cube package. Settled down, whether on the deck or on stilts, he can be expanded telescopically and offers a bathroom, kitchen and sleeping area and large, handsome windows. \"Fred,\" say the judges, \"is much more elegant and unobtrusive than a typical trailer, and he could make a very great difference to the coastlines of much of Europe\", disfigured as they are by insensitive trailer parks and other forms of wilfully naff cheap accommodation. Fred is probably a little too sophisticated (ie, expensive) to serve as a home for refugees from natural disasters in poor parts of the world; he would, however, make a fine building block for barrios, favelas and townships. If I had a garden, I'd give Fred a home; he would make a great guest wing or writing studio. As for the two Japanese projects, both are great fun and utterly unexpected. Public toilets are usually horrid things tucked away behind evergreen hedges because they are an embarrassment. Not so Shuhei Endo's lavatories and park-keeper's hut. This is a brilliant, unabashed swirl of galvanised corrugated metal, its loops and spirals derived from the structural logic of this malleable material. Endo calls this enjoyable design exercise \"springtecture\". It's certainly jaunty and doubtless well worth spending a yen to see. Mark Dytham and Astrid Klein's temporary \"Pika Pika Pretzel Wall\" stretches 34m along Omotesando, \"Tokyo's Champs Elys\u00e9es\". There have been a lot of building site hoardings along the Omotesando recently, most of them detracting from the admittedly higgledy-piggledy streetscape. Here was a chance to transform a basic utility into a playful architectural adventure, one that would make people smile. Made of the same high-tech fabric used in the construction of high-altitude balloons, the pretzel wall lights up internally at night. As Davey notes, many of the designs favoured by the judges in this year's award are temporary or subject to change. \"Perhaps\", he adds, \"there is something about transience that brings out edge in design.\" Certainly these schemes by young professionals are encouraging in that they prove that architects still know how to experiment with materials for their and our delight. The awards also show how the best young architects at the beginning of the 21st century, whether they come from rich or poor countries, can offer basic, cheap buildings that nevertheless have the power to raise the spirit and ennoble those who use them. The future really does look good.",

      "bodyText": "Fears grew yesterday that the impending release of the paramilitary leader Johnny Adair from jail, coupled with a failed murder attempt in Portadown, could reignite a loyalist feud in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Freedom Fighters declared a truce a fortnight ago after blood-letting claimed the lives of seven Belfast men and drove hundreds of Shankill Road families from their homes. But Adair, the UFF Shankill leader re-imprisoned in August by the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, for allegedly orchestrating the conflict, was not party to the talks between paramilitary commanders which led to its resolution. Mr Mandelson has challenged a preliminary finding by the sentence review commission that Adair should be freed and the commission is due to make its final ruling at a private hearing on Wednesday in Maghaberry prison, Co Antrim, where Adair is being held. The Northern Ireland Office can appeal against a decision to let Adair out but the appeal would have to be heard the next day and he could be out within 24 hours if this went against the government. The UVF/UFF ceasefire did not include the renegade Loyalist Volunteer Force, based mainly in Portadown, Co Armagh, in which Adair has close friends. UVF members were blamed for shooting and injuring a man sitting in a van at a petrol station on on the outskirts of the town, on Saturday. The victim, who received only minor wounds to a finger and a leg, has LVF connections but the intended target is believed to have been another LVF man who was in the area a short time earlier. Portadown UVF and LVF have old scores to settle, not least the murder of the UVF commander, Richard Jameson, last January at his home just a few miles from the latest shooting. \"Jameson was a big hit and the UVF have not forgotten that,\" said a loyalist source. \"If they succeed in taking out a senior LVF man then Adair's people could tacitly back retaliation and the links are close enough to Belfast that the whole thing could reignite. Either the UVF or LVF could make the first strike.\" Renewed violence between loyalists could also have indirect consequences for the overall peace process, stalled because unionists and republicans are in dispute over paramilitary decommissioning, demilitarisation and future policing arrangements. It would put David Trimble, the first minister of the Northern Ireland assembly who has barred Sinn Fein from cross-border ministerial meetings because of lack of progress on IRA disarmament, under more pressure on two counts. Within a few weeks, he will face renewed calls from his Ulster Unionist dissidents to withdraw from the power-sharing Stormont government unless the provisionals re-engage seriously with General John de Chastelain's decommissioning body. Mr Trimble has always called for all paramilitaries to disarm, but republicans will argue there is no onus for them to give up guns which are silent while loyalist weapons remain active. And confidence in the process will be further shaken if Adair is released. The government pledge to rearrest prisoners freed early under the Good Friday agreement if it believed they were involved in violence was a central plank in persuading moderates to vote for the peace accord.",

Spain, Portugal, France, and Belgium are carrying out health checks on their soldiers who have served in Kosovo to test for traces of radiation as concerns grow in the Netherlands about a \"Balkans syndrome\". Italy's military prosecutor, Antonio Intelisano, is examining five deaths that some scientists link to the ammunition used during the 1999 bombing of Kosovo. Britain is maintaining Nato's official line that no link exists. The Ministry of Defence says it will monitor investigations by Britain's Nato allies but has no plans to tests its soldiers. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said there had been no problems with leukaemia or other illnesses among US troops who had served in the Balkans. But last week Belgium's defence minister, Andr\u00e9 Flahaut, called on his European Union counterparts to investigate. Portugal will send military and scientific experts from the national atomic institute to test radiation levels in Kosovo in the wake of the death from leukaemia of Corporal Hugo Paulino. Citing \"herpes of the brain\" as cause of death, the army refused to allow his family to commission a postmortem examination. Relatives accused Nato of a cover-up over the 31,000 rounds of depleted uranium ammunition used by US A10 ground attack aircraft to pierce Serbian armour. The Pentagon at first refused to say whether uranium shells were used in Kosovo. Peacekeepers who served in Bosnia were also feared to be at risk as 10,800 such shells were used by Nato in the 1994-95 civil war. Italian authorities are reportedly investigating the cases of 15 soldiers diagnosed with cancer after returning from the former Yugoslavia. A military report leaked to La Repubblica newspaper over Christmas admitted that Italian soldiers were dying from leukaemia caused by depleted uranium. The government resisted calls for Balkan tours of duty to be shortened but agreed to set up a scientific committee. The French, Dutch and Spanish are planning to do likewise. The Spanish defence ministry says it will examine all 32,000 soldiers who have served in the Balkan region since 1992. A spokesman said none of the tests on 5,000 soldiers screened in recent months had proved positive. The ministry said all returning troops are routinely given physical examinations, but the new testing is specifically directed at the question of uranium radiation. The ministry medical chief, Colonel Luis Villalonga, said the tests were designed to calm soldiers' fears. \"Spanish troops in Kosovo were deployed in zones where these arms were not used,\" he said. Controversy over depleted uranium has raged since battlefields were contaminated during the Gulf war, reportedly causing cancer among Iraqi civilians and allied troops. Symptoms allegedly associated with \"Gulf war syndrome\" have been recorded in around 5,000 British personnel who served in that campaign.

      "bodyText": "Sweden takes over the EU presidency today, promising to bring a touch of Nordic pragmatism and rigour to some of the toughest challenges facing the union. Goodwill and expectations are unusually high as Goran Persson, the prime minister, settles into the rotating hot seat after disappointment at France's rocky stewardship, which ended last night to near universal relief. Sweden joined the club in 1995, and this is the first time it has run the rotating presidency, always a demanding job for any small country but still a golden six-month opportunity to make an impression on union business. France will be remembered for the Treaty of Nice, an ill-tempered and unambitious affair that just about agreed the long-overdue institutional reforms needed to allow the EU to take in up to 13 new members in the coming years. Enlargement is Mr Persson's biggest priority, not only because success is central to the future of the entire EU, but also because leading candidates such as Poland, Estonia and Latvia are situated in Sweden's own Baltic backyard. And closely linked to this issue is the thorny question of relations with Russia and Ukraine, which will become the union's immediate neighbours when the first newcomers join. \"I find it hard to think that anything is more important for the enlargement process than that we have a good relationship between the EU and Russia,\" Mr Persson said recently. The Swedish social democrat wants to quicken the glacial pace of negotiations and may even set a date for the first accessions, which France repeatedly refused to do. But with concern growing in Germany and elsewhere about the cost of the project, and some of the toughest issues such as agriculture and aid funds still looming, it remains to be seen how much progress can actually be made. Mr Persson has big ideas on the environment and employment. In Brussels, the Swedish environment commissioner, Margot Wallstrom, has established solid \"green\" credentials and the Gothenburg summit in June will be devoted to sustainable development. Sweden also wants to use its presidency to help salvage a deal on climate change, after the collapse of the Hague conference over huge differences between the EU and US. In March, at the Stockholm summit, leaders will review progress made since ambitious targets for social and employment policy were set in Lisbon last year. Not surprisingly, the country that is the home to the telecoms giant Ericsson will be pushing for better opportunities to exploit new technologies and bring Europe up to enviable US levels of growth and job generation. Transparency is a key concern - Sweden's instinctive openness has often brought clashes with more secretive member states. Its presidency website is already a model of clarity and accessibility. Exuding probity and Scandinavian values, Mr Persson has pledged to work for a union \"characterised by cost efficiency and budget restrictiveness\" as well as \"mainstreaming\" gender equality - the theme of a ministerial strategy session later this month. Other challenges include the difficult defence dossier, currently stuck on the crucial question of relations between the EU's nascent rapid reaction force and Nato, and specific difficulties with France and Turkey. As Sweden is a long-standing neutral which sat out the cold war, this is an especially intriguing and delicate mission. Further afield, the crisis in the Middle East will be a test for Stockholm's ability to represent the union on the world stage, and an important time for the foreign policy supremo, Javier Solana, repeatedly upstaged by France. North Korea, emerging from its long years as the Stalinist hermit kingdom, will be a preoccupation. More widely, President George W Bush will be less of an enigma by the time Mr Persson greets him at the EU-US summit in June. \"Assuming the presidency for the first time is a proud moment for relative newcomers to the EU scene,\" commented the Brussels European Voice, widely read by Eurocrats. \"It will be up to Sweden to restore faith in the current system and show that it can work in the way that it should.\" Mr Persson has got that message loud and clear. \"The EU is not only talk,\" he declared. \"But it is also hard facts, delivery, a practical approach... about politics that make a difference and change the daily lives of citizens.\" \u0095 The former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt said in an interview published yesterday that the EU had achieved very little over the past decade, and criticised its expansion plans. \"With the sole exception of the euro, it has achieved nothing in the last 10 years,\" Mr Schmidt, 82, told the Tagesspiegel daily. As Social Democrat chancellor from 1974 to 1982, Mr Schmidt, in partnership with French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard D'Estaing, helped forge the Exchange Rate Mechanism - the forerunner to European monetary union. But in the outspoken interview, Mr Schmidt criticised the EU's latest steps aimed at accepting new members. \"The more members join, the harder it will be to change... Expectations are developing too quickly, internal rules too slowly,\" he warned. Snow and scepticism \u0095 Euroscepticism in Sweden is as familiar as crispbread, with a survey last month showing that only 37%of Swedes support membership, let alone deeper integration. Polls show far greater support for enlargement. \u0095 Public feeling against joining the single currency has hardened since Denmark rejected the euro in September. A recent poll showed that 62% of Swedes do not want to scrap the krone. \u0095 Analysts say one reason for the anti-euro sentiment is confidence that Sweden has emerged leaner and fitter from a recession and does not want the shelter or the straitjacket of the single currency. \u0095 The Swedish government, which backs euro membership \"in principle\", has pledged to hold a referendum on the euro, though it has not fixed a date. \u0095 Swedes are sensitive to the EU's reputation for secrecy, and paid close attention to a fraud scandal at the European commission's Stockholm office last year.",

      "body": "<p>On September 15 1972, an \"important announcement\" appeared in the pages of the Ugandan Argus newspaper in east Africa. The announcement was financed by the ratepayers of the city of Leicester, England. \"The City Council of Leicester, England, believes that many families in Uganda are considering moving to Leicester,\" the notice read. Its advice was straightforward: don't. Thousands of families were already waiting on the council's housing list, schools were full to bursting, social services were stretched to the limit ... \"In your own interests and those of your family you should ... not come to Leicester.\"</p> <p>For Uganda's Asian population, in the process of being expelled from their country by Idi Amin, it wasn't much of a welcome. But Leicester's city council believed urgent measures were needed. More than 10,000 Indians and east Africans of Asian descent had already settled in the area, and were now highly likely to encourage their relatives in Uganda - most of whom held British passports - to join them. The council panicked. A delegation was sent to the home secretary, Robert Carr, urging him to find homes for the Ugandan Asians - but not in Leicester.</p> <p>Despite the best efforts of the city council, however, the Ugandans did come. And today, thanks in part to that influx, Leicester - a small, unassuming east Midlands city - is predicted to be Britain's first black majority city. The city council estimates that with Asian and black children already making up more than 50% of the school population, white people will be an ethnic minority in Leicester within a decade.</p> <p>\"It's wonderful, isn't it?\" says the high sheriff of Leicestershire, Anthony Wessel. \"I'm very proud of Leicester and its multicultural facets, the fact that there are so many people living side by side. You get a great buzz from it.\" A recent document published by Leicester city council speaks of \"the joy of being a truly diverse city\" - the same council that warned, in an emergency meeting in August 1972 , that \"the entire fabric of our city is at risk\" from immigrants.</p> <p>But a revolution seems to have taken place. Steadily, and almost entirely without fanfare, Leicester seems to have become Britain's most ethnically harmonious city. \"The relationship between the communities is wonderful,\" says Asaf Hussain, a lecturer in multi-culturalism at the university of Leicester. \"I'm not just talking between the English and the Asians. I'm talking Hindus and Muslims as well.\"</p> <p>If this story of unalloyed harmony sounds improbable, it is difficult to find anyone on the streets of Leicester who will disagree with it. \"It's just crept up on us over the past 30 years,\" says Jean Smith, 58. The hosiery factory where she works is now Asian-owned, and most of her colleagues are Asian. \"Everyone is really nice. It doesn't matter, does it? They respect our way of life and we respect theirs.\"</p> <p>Sanjay Bulsara, a 29-year-old firefighter, did have a bit of trouble at school, when he was the only Asian person in his year. \"But it only happened for about six months or so, and I haven't experienced any problems at all since then.\" Fifteen-year-old Martin, who is black, is out shopping with three white schoolfriends. He looks blank when asked about how the races mingle in Leicester. He has never experienced any kind of racist prejudice, he says. No, neither has anyone in his family. He has never heard of any of his friends having problems either. \"I don't know why it's like that here,\" he says, \"because you do hear about problems in other places, don't you?\"</p> <p>Can it really be possible that, in the country where Stephen Lawrence was murdered, a black boy can grow up a stranger to prejudice? The question, if so, is how it could have happened. And why - of all places - in Leicester?</p> <p>Despite the fierce affection the city inspires in its residents, it is probably fair to say that Leicester never knocked anyone flat by sheer force of civic charisma. It has a prettyish city centre, at least compared to many cities in the Midlands; a couple of fine medieval buildings survive, including the city's ancient south gate, now unpardonably lassoed by a dual carriageway. The centre feels prosperous and comfortable. Leicester is relaxed with itself. There is little sense, for better or worse, of the edgy energy of Coventry or Birmingham or Manchester. Even the city's motto is testament to its unassuming steadiness: semper eadem. Always the same.</p> <p>Perhaps this dogged modesty helped Leicester to absorb the influx, in little more than a decade, of the largest Asian population in Europe. But the wider explanation lies in the peculiar pattern of migration to Leicester in the past 50 years. The first black immigrants arrived from the Caribbean after the war, to be followed, in the late 60s, by increasing numbers of people from east Africa. Industry may have been the initial draw, particularly since it offered plentiful employment to women as well as men - or it may simply be that the first settlers in Leicester liked what they saw, and encouraged their families to follow.</p> <p>Either way, the city's charms proved irresistible. The Asian population quadrupled in a decade, and by 1981, of the 200,000 people living in Leicester, 44,000 were ethnic Indians, mostly Hindus and Sikhs, including those who had fled Amin's Uganda and its neighbouring countries. What sweetened the pill for the white population was that most of these people were middle class, often bringing capital with them. They were experienced businesspeople, and well practised at blending in. Unlike the mostly Urdu-speaking Muslim population of cities like Bradford, Leicester's Gujarati and Punjabi Asian population were on the second leg of their long journey from the Indian subcontinent. They had already developed strategies for integrating, as a minority ethnic culture, into an alien society.</p> <p>Resham Sandhu, a Sikh community leader and chairman of Leicester's council of faiths, was one of those who arrived in the early 70s. \"I think from the very beginning when people started coming to Leicester, there were people who were looking to make the city into one society, not just a city of sections, and they have been working very hard since then.\"</p> <p>Gurharpal Singh, a professor of Indian politics at the University of Hull and the author of a book on Asian Leicester, agrees. \"One of the factors is that in the 1980s the young Labour party leadership was very dynamic in pushing forward an agenda of equality, because they had lived through the racism of the 70s. There have not been many direct clashes between the communities on the issues which have been apparent in other areas.\"</p> <p>The result, after 30 years, is a city with ethnic minority representation at the highest level. Leicester has an Asian MP, Keith Vaz, and has had Asians as deputy chief of police, chief executive of the city council, lord mayor and deputy to the lord lieutenant. Almost a third of the city's councillors are non-white.</p> <p>It is a beguiling utopian vision, but one which, inevitably, is rather simplified. \"There is a tendency to overstate the model community,\" says Singh. \"The people managing multiculturalism in Leicester have a vested interest in portraying it as harmonious. But in so doing they often neglect the disenchantment and lower achievement among working-class groups.\" Certainly on the (still mainly white) housing estates to the west and north, one doesn't need to look too hard to find unreconstructed prejudice. \"I'm not racist, but this is a white man's country,\" says one community leader from the Stocking Farm estate. \"Most people here can't stand the idea of there being more of them, because there's already so many of them, and they have sectioned the city anyway.\"</p> <p>Judgemeadow Community College, to the south-east of the city, presents a more positive image of the new Leicester. The school was originally designed as a girls' grammar but in September 1972 it was forced to open early, half built, with eight teachers, to take in children from Uganda. Today the majority of the 1,200 pupils still come from Asian backgrounds, but the intake is mixed, with a sizeable chunk of white children, and a few Afro-Caribbeans.</p> <p>The children here are blank, even scornful, when asked about ethnic integration. They insist they are completely colourblind. \"Why should it be an issue that we all get along?\" asks 16-year-old Narinder. \"We have grown up with it. We live with it. To us this is Leicester, take it or leave it.\"</p> <p>They have heard of Stephen Lawrence, but the name is as foreign to them as the notion of a racist murder. \"We don't see each other as Asian or white,\" says Becky, 13. \"Maybe that's a problem in London, but it isn't here.\"</p> <p>Then, shyly, 13-year-old Imran says that he has been a victim of racism. Everyone turns to look. \"I moved to Birmingham when I was six, and I was in a primary school of Muslims,\" he says. \"When I came back to Leicester everyone teased me because of my Birmingham accent.\"</p>",

The US was also holding out until the last minute, and the radio said Israel would immediately reconsider its refusal if Washington decides to sign. The international criminal court, based on principles similar to those of the Nazi war crimes trials at the end of the second world war, would try individuals accused of the most heinous atrocities - mass murders, war crimes and other gross human rights violations. It would be based in the Netherlands. Mr Melchior said opposition centred on a provision in the treaty which defines as a war crime \"the transfer, directly or indirectly, by the occupying power of parts of its own civilian population into territories it occupies\". Legal experts have said the clause would go beyond existing international conventions that term Israeli settlements on occupied land illegal, and could make Israeli leaders indictable before the court. Some 200,000 Israelis live in about 145 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, land Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war and territory which the Palestinians are seeking for a future state. Bill Clinton has come under strong pressure from the Pentagon not to sign until Washington gets airtight guarantees that no US serviceman or other government official abroad would be subject to the court's jurisdiction. Leading Republicans in Congress have mounted a drive against the treaty, seeking at the minimum a strong role for the UN security council, in which the US has a veto. The tribunal comes into force when 60 countries have ratified the treaty. So far 136 countries have signed it and 27 have ratified it. From today a country can only ratify and no longer just sign the treaty, which means it will lose influence during negotiations on the court's procedures.

      "body": "<p>Last year we celebrated a new millennium. And in doing so, we reaffirmed the promise that by working together we can improve the human condition for all people - especially the world's poorest. </p> <p>This millennial spirit has been perhaps best captured by an extraordinary movement - inspired by the biblical concept of Jubilee - to cancel foreign debt in the world's poorest, most heavily indebted countries. Religious leaders, rock stars, and concerned men and women around the world have galvanised public action and inspired official policy. </p> <p>This spirit has been central to the mission of the World Bank, and nowhere more indelibly than in the area of poor country debt relief. Four years ago we launched with the international community the first global response to the debt crisis in the world's poorest countries, and in October 1999 we emboldened the programme by making the relief deeper, broader, and faster. The objective of the plan, called the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), has remained straightforward: to eliminate debt as an obstacle to poverty reduction. </p> <p>What has been accomplished? First, we have met our goal of having debt relief in place for 22 countries, with 20 already completed. Second, the programme is cancelling an enormous amount of debt: relief stands at some $35bn (\u00a323bn); in co-ordination with other forms of debt alleviation, total debt in these countries could be slashed by more than two-thirds. </p> <p>New resources will enable governments to sharply increase desperately needed social investments. After relief, social spending is rising to between two and three times debt service obligations. As a result, millions more children will have a chance to learn to read and write; health clinics and rural roads and sanitation facilities will be built; Aids programmes will reach the afflicted; and already, people, working with their governments, are charting their own development course. </p> <p>We can do much more and ask the bigger, tougher questions. Most important: will these achievements endure? Will the child born today in Africa stand a better chance of reaching his fifth birthday because of what we have done together? Will fewer poor women die giving birth? Will the endless work of farmers and mothers and doctors and entrepreneurs be enough? If debt relief is our only, or even, primary response, the answer is no. If, however, we extend our demands, and our efforts, to address the deeper causes of poverty, we can make a difference. </p> <p>First, while debt relief is critically important, it will only help reduce poverty if developing countries continue the hard work of improving economic management. There is much to discuss about which policies best support poverty reduction. But there is no argument that runaway deficits and inflation punish the poor most; subsidies which benefit elites are unfair; and corruption strangles the weakest first. Fortunately, real progress is under way. </p> <p>Take Uganda and Mozambique, the earliest qualifiers for HIPC debt relief, and until a decade ago two of the most troubled lands on earth. Both have sustained strong economic growth while reducing absolute poverty and lifting primary school enrolment. This progress is due not only to debt relief but to the hard work and ideas from the people. </p> <p>Debt relief which supports such efforts is a sound investment. But it cannot replace development assistance. And here is where a vigorous public debate is badly needed. There is a widely held fiction that masses of money is poured into aid. In fact, industrialised countries spend roughly one-quarter of one percent of their gross domestic product for assistance to the world's poor countries. Aid works, and we can do more to make it work for more people. </p> <p>What about future lending? Access to external capital is fundamental to any country's development, but borrowers and lenders need to be vigilant about the long-term sustainability of the resulting debt. In many instances this will mean shifting to grants and strictly limiting new lending to only the most generous terms. </p> <p>The World Bank, which provides resources to the poorest countries interest-free, is exploring new instruments, including grants, for such pressing needs as HIV/Aids, the environment, basic education, and health. </p> <p>Next, it is time to get serious on trade. Barriers to developing country exports in industrialised markets continue to severely disadvantage poor countries. Last year, industrialised countries spent more than $300bn on agricultural subsidies - roughly equal to the total GNP for all of sub-Saharan Africa. Debt relief without increased market access is futile. </p> <p>Finally, the Aids epidemic, particularly in Africa, makes action in all of these efforts more crucial. In some of the hardest-hit African countries, life expectancy over the coming decade may fall from 60 to below 30. </p> <p>Ambitions for health care, education, agriculture, energy and other development areas are endangered by the simple prospect that there will not be enough teachers, students, farmers and workers alive to realise them. Hope, however, persists. </p> <p>In countries which have undertaken education, testing and treatment programmes, infection rates are falling. Encouraging partnerships are under way to build on these efforts, but it will require a sustained effort. </p> <p>The challenges of the new century are daunting. But we confront them with renewed confidence. </p> <p>For those who have kept the spirit of Jubilee and fought for debt relief, we know what can be accomplished by working together. We must keep this spirit alive, this year and for years to come. There is no alternative. </p> <p>\u0095 James Wolfensohn is president of the World Bank</p>",

The objective of the plan, called the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), has remained straightforward: to eliminate debt as an obstacle to poverty reduction. What has been accomplished? First, we have met our goal of having debt relief in place for 22 countries, with 20 already completed. Second, the programme is cancelling an enormous amount of debt: relief stands at some $35bn (\u00a323bn); in co-ordination with other forms of debt alleviation, total debt in these countries could be slashed by more than two-thirds. New resources will enable governments to sharply increase desperately needed social investments. After relief, social spending is rising to between two and three times debt service obligations. As a result, millions more children will have a chance to learn to read and write; health clinics and rural roads and sanitation facilities will be built; Aids programmes will reach the afflicted; and already, people, working with their governments, are charting their own development course. We can do much more and ask the bigger, tougher questions. Most important: will these achievements endure? Will the child born today in Africa stand a better chance of reaching his fifth birthday because of what we have done together? Will fewer poor women die giving birth? Will the endless work of farmers and mothers and doctors and entrepreneurs be enough? If debt relief is our only, or even, primary response, the answer is no. If, however, we extend our demands, and our efforts, to address the deeper causes of poverty, we can make a difference. First, while debt relief is critically important, it will only help reduce poverty if developing countries continue the hard work of improving economic management. There is much to discuss about which policies best support poverty reduction. But there is no argument that runaway deficits and inflation punish the poor most; subsidies which benefit elites are unfair; and corruption strangles the weakest first. Fortunately, real progress is under way. Take Uganda and Mozambique, the earliest qualifiers for HIPC debt relief, and until a decade ago two of the most troubled lands on earth. Both have sustained strong economic growth while reducing absolute poverty and lifting primary school enrolment. This progress is due not only to debt relief but to the hard work and ideas from the people. Debt relief which supports such efforts is a sound investment. But it cannot replace development assistance. And here is where a vigorous public debate is badly needed. There is a widely held fiction that masses of money is poured into aid. In fact, industrialised countries spend roughly one-quarter of one percent of their gross domestic product for assistance to the world's poor countries. Aid works, and we can do more to make it work for more people. What about future lending? Access to external capital is fundamental to any country's development, but borrowers and lenders need to be vigilant about the long-term sustainability of the resulting debt. In many instances this will mean shifting to grants and strictly limiting new lending to only the most generous terms. The World Bank, which provides resources to the poorest countries interest-free, is exploring new instruments, including grants, for such pressing needs as HIV/Aids, the environment, basic education, and health. Next, it is time to get serious on trade. Barriers to developing country exports in industrialised markets continue to severely disadvantage poor countries. Last year, industrialised countries spent more than $300bn on agricultural subsidies - roughly equal to the total GNP for all of sub-Saharan Africa. Debt relief without increased market access is futile. Finally, the Aids epidemic, particularly in Africa, makes action in all of these efforts more crucial. In some of the hardest-hit African countries, life expectancy over the coming decade may fall from 60 to below 30. Ambitions for health care, education, agriculture, energy and other development areas are endangered by the simple prospect that there will not be enough teachers, students, farmers and workers alive to realise them. Hope, however, persists. In countries which have undertaken education, testing and treatment programmes, infection rates are falling. Encouraging partnerships are under way to build on these efforts, but it will require a sustained effort. The challenges of the new century are daunting. But we confront them with renewed confidence. For those who have kept the spirit of Jubilee and fought for debt relief, we know what can be accomplished by working together. We must keep this spirit alive, this year and for years to come. There is no alternative. \u0095 James Wolfensohn is president of the World Bank",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair was facing mounting pressure last night to open up Labour's books and name a mystery donor who has contributed \u00a32m to the party's general election campaign fund.</p> <p>The former cabinet minister David Clark said that Labour should always strive to be transparent, while one of the party's most generous donors said that the current system was no way to fund political parties.</p> <p>Lord Haskins, the chairman of Northern Foods, who always publishes the amount he gives to the Labour party, said: \"Some people want to remain private. But this is not the right way to fund political parties. Openness is always the best way. It stops the speculation.\"</p> <p>Reports that Labour has banked a \u00a32m donation come weeks before \"anti-sleaze\" legislation requiring details of gifts to be disclosed comes into effect. The Labour party refused to discuss the donation last night, saying: \"We do not discuss individual donations and we do not give a running commentary.\"</p> <p>Labour has not broken any rules because the name of the donor will be published later this year in the party's annual accounts, which list the name of anyone who gives more than \u00a35,000. But it will be impossible to identify the \u00a32m donor in the list, which had the names of 68 donors last year.</p> <p>This system, which has been criticised as vague, will be changed on February 16, when a new law, the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act, requires the names of donors and the size of their gifts to be disclosed to a new electoral commission. Donations received before then will escape the new rules.</p> <p>Labour faces pressure to open up its books because of past criticism that the government has granted favours to large donors. Mr Blair faced his first real test as prime minister in the autumn of 1997 when Labour sought to cover up a \u00a31m donation from the formula one boss Bernie Ecclestone. It later emerged that the sport had temporarily been exempted from a ban on tobacco advertising shortly after Mr Ecclestone's donation.</p> <p>Andrew Lansley, Tory Cabinet Office spokesman, said: \"People may reasonably expect Labour to confirm the source and the amount of this donation so that we can see whether it is another formula one-style donation.\"</p> <p>The independent MP Martin Bell, who sits on the Commons standards and privileges committee, said Labour should publish the donor's name. \"If it is good enough to publish names of donors in February, then it is good enough to do so now,\" he said.</p> <p>The Labour party's silence contrasts with its openness in 1999 when the science minister, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, gave \u00a32m, setting a new record for a single donation. Downing Street said that Lord Sainsbury had decided to disclose the donation to allow the Labour party to appear \"transparent and above board\".</p> <p>The latest \u00a32m donation is likely to have been from one of Labour's regular business donors who may have wanted to avoid being identified as such a generous benefactor when the new rules come into force. Last year's donors included Robert Bourne, whose Legacy consortium is in negotiations to buy the Millennium Dome; Lord Gavron, the former chairman of the Guardian Media Group, the parent company of the Guardian; and Gulam Noon, whose company, Noon Products, supplies curries to Sainsbury's.</p> <p>The latest donation is said to have been secured by the multi-millionaire music impresario Lord Levy, Labour's chief fundraiser. Mr Blair was said to be so delighted with Lord Levy, who recently took on a role as the prime minister's envoy to Latin America in addition to his work in the Middle East, that he invited him to a party at Chequers on Boxing Day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair was facing mounting pressure last night to open up Labour's books and name a mystery donor who has contributed \u00a32m to the party's general election campaign fund. The former cabinet minister David Clark said that Labour should always strive to be transparent, while one of the party's most generous donors said that the current system was no way to fund political parties. Lord Haskins, the chairman of Northern Foods, who always publishes the amount he gives to the Labour party, said: \"Some people want to remain private. But this is not the right way to fund political parties. Openness is always the best way. It stops the speculation.\" Reports that Labour has banked a \u00a32m donation come weeks before \"anti-sleaze\" legislation requiring details of gifts to be disclosed comes into effect. The Labour party refused to discuss the donation last night, saying: \"We do not discuss individual donations and we do not give a running commentary.\" Labour has not broken any rules because the name of the donor will be published later this year in the party's annual accounts, which list the name of anyone who gives more than \u00a35,000. But it will be impossible to identify the \u00a32m donor in the list, which had the names of 68 donors last year. This system, which has been criticised as vague, will be changed on February 16, when a new law, the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act, requires the names of donors and the size of their gifts to be disclosed to a new electoral commission. Donations received before then will escape the new rules. Labour faces pressure to open up its books because of past criticism that the government has granted favours to large donors. Mr Blair faced his first real test as prime minister in the autumn of 1997 when Labour sought to cover up a \u00a31m donation from the formula one boss Bernie Ecclestone. It later emerged that the sport had temporarily been exempted from a ban on tobacco advertising shortly after Mr Ecclestone's donation. Andrew Lansley, Tory Cabinet Office spokesman, said: \"People may reasonably expect Labour to confirm the source and the amount of this donation so that we can see whether it is another formula one-style donation.\" The independent MP Martin Bell, who sits on the Commons standards and privileges committee, said Labour should publish the donor's name. \"If it is good enough to publish names of donors in February, then it is good enough to do so now,\" he said. The Labour party's silence contrasts with its openness in 1999 when the science minister, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, gave \u00a32m, setting a new record for a single donation. Downing Street said that Lord Sainsbury had decided to disclose the donation to allow the Labour party to appear \"transparent and above board\". The latest \u00a32m donation is likely to have been from one of Labour's regular business donors who may have wanted to avoid being identified as such a generous benefactor when the new rules come into force. Last year's donors included Robert Bourne, whose Legacy consortium is in negotiations to buy the Millennium Dome; Lord Gavron, the former chairman of the Guardian Media Group, the parent company of the Guardian; and Gulam Noon, whose company, Noon Products, supplies curries to Sainsbury's. The latest donation is said to have been secured by the multi-millionaire music impresario Lord Levy, Labour's chief fundraiser. Mr Blair was said to be so delighted with Lord Levy, who recently took on a role as the prime minister's envoy to Latin America in addition to his work in the Middle East, that he invited him to a party at Chequers on Boxing Day.",

The new hearing, expected to start next month, will also look at up to 200 suspicious deaths instead of only 38 - all concessions demanded by relatives of former patients of the Greater Manchester GP. The u-turn by the health secretary, Alan Milburn, was welcomed yesterday by the families, not only in Greater Manchester but in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, where Shipman's murderous career may have started much earlier than previously thought. The judge, Dame Janet Smith, 60, who was brought up in Lancashire and has wide experience of medical negligence cases, is expected to start public sessions of the inquiry in February. Subject to approval by parliament, she will take over from Lord Laming, former chief inspector of social services, whose narrower inquiry, due to be held in private, was halted last month when victims' relatives won a judicial review. Mr Milburn, who is expected to announce the strengthened inquiry and its timetable in Manchester later this week, was praised for \"listening to the relatives' arguments\" by the families' solicitor, Ann Alexander. She said that the public hearings and extended scope of the inquiry were exactly what relatives had considered essential to unravelling how the GP got away repeatedly with murder. Shipman, 54, was convicted last January of killing 15 patients in the Hyde area of Greater Manchester, where he preyed on elderly women for reasons that have yet to be fathomed. After he was given 15 life sentences, the police said that they had enough evidence to charge him with 23 other deaths, but the crown prosecution service ruled out new proceedings on the grounds that a fair trial would be impossible after previous evidence and the publication of at least two books. Ms Alexander said the new inquiry would be able to look at \"gaps in the NHS system\" that allowed Shipman to continue quietly killing patients for years, and possibly decades.

He complained that he was always referred to as a right-wing writer and asked why this should be. \"Because you worked for Vichy and you were in favour of keeping Algeria French,\" replied Robert Badinter, the future justice minister. According to Laurent, at this, he and Mitterrand exchanged amused glances; Badinter had effectively provided a portrait of France's next president as well.</p> <p>Laurent worked for the wartime Vichy collaborationist government - as did Mitterrand. They got on well and might have met before the war when Laurent frequented the Brasserie Lipp, on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris, with other young far-rightists. Laurent had many contacts with right wing extremists in the conspiratorial La Cagoule group which had been defended in court by his father, Laurent-C\u00e9ly (to give him his full name).</p> <p>Since Laurent was a follower of the far-right Charles Maurras, his connection with Vichy was natural. But with Laurent there were always surprises. In 1944 he seems to have been among those who negotiated between the leader of Vichy, Marshall P\u00e9tain, and the Free French. The failure of those talks led Laurent to join a resistance group. The episode remains mysterious, but enabled him to avoid postwar retribution.</p> <p>I knew Claude Martine, who became Laurent's first wife, and thus met him in 1947 and 1948. He was writing a novel, but the book he gave me was about France's position in Europe and the author's name appeared as Alb\u00e9ric Varenne. Laurent explained that in France you were expected to write only one sort of book, so that if you changed your role as an author you had to change your name.</p> <p>I only appreciated this later when Martine gave me a lift in a magnificent Buick. She explained that Caroline Ch\u00e9rie was a best-seller - it also became a 1950 film. I then realised that Jacques Laurent was also C\u00e9cil de Saint-Laurent, the best-seller's author. (He had also been writing pseudonymous detective novels). His finances transformed, he completed two novels, which had a limited success and then for 17 years Jacques Laurent wrote no novels, although C\u00e9cil continued on his profitable way.</p> <p>He had two enemies. One was Jean-Paul Sartre and his intellectual dominance (Laurent used the word \"terrorism\"). He wrote a devastating pamphlet, Paul et Jean-Paul (1951), which argued that the prevailing Marxism and existentialism were designed to reduce the writer to \"revolutionary worker\". In 1953 he founded a revue, La Parisienne, as an answer to Sartre's Les Temps Modernes. By being open to all literary genres the right checked the left in the name of artistic autonomy and quality.</p> <p>The second enemy was Charles de Gaulle. Laurent had ignored him when writing about France in 1940, but when Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac published a hagiographic account of de Gaulle in 1964, Laurent responded with two violent attacks on the president. This landed him in court where he was ordered to remove 20 pages of his Mauriac Sous de Gaulle.</p> <p>He opposed de Gaulle giving independence to Algeria and showed sympathy for the French settlers's secret army which committed violence inside France. He maintained the Vichy accusation that de Gaulle was a British creation in 1940, but his arguments in favour of a P\u00e9tainist resistance to the Germans are more readily accepted today.</p> <p>After a visit to Vietnam in 1967 and 1968, which resulted in an anti-communist book and a violent attack on the French intellectuals for supporting north Vietnam, Laurent returned to novel-writing and produced his finest work. Notable are the Prix Goncourt-winning Les B\u00eatises (1971) and Les Miroir aux Tiroirs (1990). The first, beginning with an account of the war and of adventures with the resistance, becomes a study in the inadequacies of autobiography and narrative. The later novel is a study of a man's relations with a number of women, while retaining his idea of freedom. Both are witty and picturesque. He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1986.</p> <p>Laurent's writings are carefully constructed. Yet he could be very careless in the actual writing. He would, for example, ask Claude Martine to write a passage while he did something else. She used to say that she would describe a female character and go into great detail concerning her clothes. He would then take up the story and promptly undress the character.</p> <p>For a time, from 1954, Laurent owned and edited the weekly Arts magazine. Interested in the cinema, he entrusted film reviews to such people as future film-makers Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and Eric Rohmer. He wrote several film scripts. The Caroline films, mixing historical drama and eroticism, were a great success, and Lola Mont\u00e8s (1955) and his adaptation of Stendhal's De L'Amour (1954) were well received. His one venture into film production, 48 Heures d'amour (1968), was a failure.</p> <p>Laurent was one of the rightist writers who were referred to as the Hussards, but he was very different from the others. He had a lively sense of humour. After the death of Gide, a telegram was sent to Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac which read, \"There is no Hell. Have a good time. Andr\u00e9.\" It was widely assumed that it was sent by Laurent. He would answer questions as his interviewer hoped he would. He explained to an English journalist that he changed his girlfriends according to colour - thus a black woman would be succeeded by a blonde Swede. He told a serious questioner about the Brasserie Lipp that he could remember when customers were looked after by a groom, who was a dwarf.</p> <p>For years Laurent appeared to be a spent force, spending days chez Lipp. Then suddenly he would produce a book. His last novel was Moment Particuliers (1997). Last October, after his third wife, Elizabeth, died he published a letter to her, describing the happiness of their life together over many years. He insisted that Figaro should publish a photograph of them in bed together. His conclusion was that, with her gone, life had become a nightmare.</p> <p>\u0095 Jacques Laurent-C\u00e9ly, writer, born January 5, 1919; died December 29 2000.</p>",

He established and developed civil procedure as a subject of university study and helped bridge the gap between the academic and professional worlds, culminating in his directorship of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies.</p> <p>His procedural philosophy, described in his 1986 Hamlyn Lectures, was based on the belief that the parties to civil disputes were best served by a fairly balanced adversary procedure with the court playing a passive, non-interventionist role. Thus he was initially opposed to Lord Woolf's recent reforms of the civil rules, dominated as they are by notions of court control, but he came to accept the need for radical change on the basis that the judiciary would be able to adequately oversee the new regime. Paradoxically, the Woolf changes were constructed on foundations which Jacob had created or influenced.</p> <p>Jacob was born in Shanghai and educated at the public school for boys in the city, his father having settled there from Iraq as an employee of the Sassoon merchant family.

Joan Stone, who was restaurant manager at a conference centre in Cumbria, was discovered with her husband, Peter, and their teenage daughter, Emma-Jane, after police and firemen smashed down their front door. A neighbour called emergency services to the \u00a370,000 bungalow in Crossfield Road, Cleator Moor, Cumbria, after hearing the smoke alarm ringing in the afternoon and seeing the windows misted over. Firemen were initially forced back from the house by fumes, but found the victims when they re-entered using breathing apparatus. The parents were slumped together in the living room and Emma-Jane, 16, their only child, was in another room. \"We suspect that carbon monoxide was the cause of the deaths, but an investigation is under way to establish that,\" said a spokesman for Cumbria fire brigade. \"It appears to be a tragic accident.\" Mr Stone, who like his wife was in his 50s, had recently taken early retirement from an IT post at the Sellafield nuclear plant. The couple were well liked locally, and Emma-Jane was described by neighbours as \"a lovely girl, mad keen on horses\" and had a horse of her own. A black scarf was looped last night round a snowman which the family had built in the garden, close to where their Mercedes and Mini-Cooper cars still stood. Bunches of flowers were also laid nearby by neighbours. \"Everyone who knew them is overcome by what's happened, especially at this time of the year,\" said Alfred Sheil, 52, who lives across the road from the bungalow. Emma-Jane was a pupil at Whitehaven comprehensive, a highly rated local school, and shared her father's interest in computers and IT.

I'm (to choose terms carefully) sorry about this: but welcome to Luton airport. Once upon a not-too-distant time, nobody was ever particularly sorry about anything. Trains and boats and planes either ran or they didn't. You paid your money and you took your (alas, nationalised industry) chance. There was an assumption that whatever was out there, failing to arrive, was an act of god. And then came customer relations.</p> <p>Mrs Thatcher began it with privatisation. The first apologies, acknowledging that all was manifestly not well, began to creep over Tannoy systems. John Major picked up her baton: stuck on the M1, travellers could pick up a mobile phone and call the cones hotline for a ritual grovel. Full credit, though, to Tony Blair and the Irish potato famine; they have finished the job. Sorry isn't the hardest word any longer; it is the glib panacea to meet all ills. I am not, to be clear, picking on the admirable Stelios of easyJet fame, nor on the proud town of Luton. They have both had a dreadful Christmas.</p> <p>On good days, easyJet provide the cheapest, most flexible way for grandfathers of new babies in Barcelona (me) to get out to Catalonia fast and worship at the crib. On bad days, cheapness and flexibility are expected pawns, to be offered up without undue complaint. You get mostly what you pay for, and less ought, in logic, to mean less.</p> <p>What happened? Mundane stuff happened. On the way out, the call to the gate for 17.05, followed by radio silence. Eventually the electronic boards showed a 21.20 departure - but suddenly Tannoy Teresa was on air and sorry. Take no notice - repeat, no notice - of electronic messages: reality was chalked on a board by duty free. Reality was 22.30. Sorry about that. The road back was a sorry one, too.\"Sorry,\" said our jovial pilot, \"two snowflakes and everything goes down the drain.\" Time lost on two two-hour flights: 29 hours.</p> <p>And so to Luton Parkway railway station in the dark of early evening. Sorry, said the electronic board, Thameslink were down to two trains an hour because of weather conditions and lack of rolling stock. Sorry, the words of Tannoy Tanya, echoed from platform two: the 16.01 to Bedford had now been cancelled and the 16.16 would be 38 minutes late. \"Thameslink regret any inconvenience to passengers this may cause.\"</p> <p>Oh! Sorry - and one more thing - please be careful of the snow and ice on platforms and walkways. Nobody, it seems, has had the time or inclination to do any sweeping up. \"I dunno,\" says my infinitely predictable taxi driver, \"I reckon this country's falling apart.\"</p> <p>No, not any more than usual - but it just keeps apologising, as though that were enough. There are often decent reasons why things go wrong. The flight out of Luton was three hours late, it transpired, because the crew on an incoming plane had been diverted to Stansted and couldn't make it back through the murk. Most passengers can understand, and sympathise, when a de-icing sub-contractor isn't up to snuff. The trouble isn't life's little deprivations - it's the assumption that saying sorry is enough to turn away wrath.</p> <p>Meaningless apologies, parroted by rote, are worse than no apology at all. If you're told about \"operational difficulties\", you want to be told what they are. If you're informed that an outgoing plane is late \"owing to the lateness of an incoming plane\", you want to know what made it late in the first place. Leave out half the story and all that's left is a redundant, pre-emptive cringe. I quote a single-sentence item from yesterday's Sunday Times, headlined \"Sales fear\". It reads, in its entirety: \"Shoppers have been warned that lack of stock could lead to a premature end of the sales.\" I'm sorry, we've sold out.</p> <p>Such things, over years, matter more than we suppose, for they become part of our culture. When Mr Blair issues his new year message about the coming of \"Opportunity Britain\", we don't salute him, bright eyed, because we remember John Prescott apologising to the Stansted pilgrims about their long night in a deserted airport. We remember the holes in the road, the deserted cones. We are used to being told how desultory our life is - but not why, or how we can make it better.</p> <p>Telling the Irish we're sorry about the potato famine (before we or they were born) may seem like disarming honesty: but, on examination, it lacks all resonance. The words are easy because they carry no true emotion. Telling taxpayers the same thing about the dome is probably little better. Why apologise for a part- fiasco when it's obvious that any politician with his head screwed on can see nothing worth defending? The words are futile because they carry no weight. The Britain I came back to through the iced needle of Luton is a curious place, no embryo territory of any superstate. There's the illusion of confidence: an economy of continuing strength, a tolerably popular government savouring re-election, energetic young ministers talking modernisation; 2001 could still be a good year. But somehow the underlying mood is bleaker than that.</p> <p>The hospitals are under intolerable pressure again. Staff shortages (and the weather). Sorry. The schools are thousands of teachers short of a load. Staff shortages (and pay). Sorry. The police are the thinnest blue line against chaos, fear and Ann Widdecombe. Staff shortages, pay, early retirement and that most useless of indefinable concepts, \"morale\".</p> <p>Opportunity UK? It would be nice to think so, to ladle out the evidence of cheer and move on. Yet our incomings never seem to fit our outgoings. Operational difficulties at every turn, impending inconvenience at every corner. We are customers devoid of relations - and I'm sorry, I just thought I'd get that off my chest.</p>",

Sorry, the words of Tannoy Tanya, echoed from platform two: the 16.01 to Bedford had now been cancelled and the 16.16 would be 38 minutes late. \"Thameslink regret any inconvenience to passengers this may cause.\" Oh! Sorry - and one more thing - please be careful of the snow and ice on platforms and walkways. Nobody, it seems, has had the time or inclination to do any sweeping up. \"I dunno,\" says my infinitely predictable taxi driver, \"I reckon this country's falling apart.\" No, not any more than usual - but it just keeps apologising, as though that were enough. There are often decent reasons why things go wrong. The flight out of Luton was three hours late, it transpired, because the crew on an incoming plane had been diverted to Stansted and couldn't make it back through the murk. Most passengers can understand, and sympathise, when a de-icing sub-contractor isn't up to snuff. The trouble isn't life's little deprivations - it's the assumption that saying sorry is enough to turn away wrath. Meaningless apologies, parroted by rote, are worse than no apology at all. If you're told about \"operational difficulties\", you want to be told what they are. If you're informed that an outgoing plane is late \"owing to the lateness of an incoming plane\", you want to know what made it late in the first place. Leave out half the story and all that's left is a redundant, pre-emptive cringe. I quote a single-sentence item from yesterday's Sunday Times, headlined \"Sales fear\". It reads, in its entirety: \"Shoppers have been warned that lack of stock could lead to a premature end of the sales.\" I'm sorry, we've sold out. Such things, over years, matter more than we suppose, for they become part of our culture. When Mr Blair issues his new year message about the coming of \"Opportunity Britain\", we don't salute him, bright eyed, because we remember John Prescott apologising to the Stansted pilgrims about their long night in a deserted airport. We remember the holes in the road, the deserted cones. We are used to being told how desultory our life is - but not why, or how we can make it better. Telling the Irish we're sorry about the potato famine (before we or they were born) may seem like disarming honesty: but, on examination, it lacks all resonance. The words are easy because they carry no true emotion. Telling taxpayers the same thing about the dome is probably little better. Why apologise for a part- fiasco when it's obvious that any politician with his head screwed on can see nothing worth defending? The words are futile because they carry no weight. The Britain I came back to through the iced needle of Luton is a curious place, no embryo territory of any superstate. There's the illusion of confidence: an economy of continuing strength, a tolerably popular government savouring re-election, energetic young ministers talking modernisation; 2001 could still be a good year. But somehow the underlying mood is bleaker than that. The hospitals are under intolerable pressure again. Staff shortages (and the weather). Sorry. The schools are thousands of teachers short of a load. Staff shortages (and pay). Sorry. The police are the thinnest blue line against chaos, fear and Ann Widdecombe. Staff shortages, pay, early retirement and that most useless of indefinable concepts, \"morale\". Opportunity UK? It would be nice to think so, to ladle out the evidence of cheer and move on. Yet our incomings never seem to fit our outgoings. Operational difficulties at every turn, impending inconvenience at every corner. We are customers devoid of relations - and I'm sorry, I just thought I'd get that off my chest.",

      "bodyText": "The son of the late French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who was jailed before Christmas on suspicion of arms dealing and money laundering, could be released within days because of a procedural fault, it emerged yesterday. Two lawyers acting for other suspects in the case said they had filed an urgent appeal for all proceedings in the case to be dropped, alleging that a key judicial document that led to the arrest of their clients and of Jean-Christophe Mitterrand had been wrongly dated. Guillaume Weill-Raynal, representing the secretary of the accused arms dealer Pierre Falcone, said the document - a search warrant application, dated July 3 - contained information that the investigating magistrate who signed it could not possibly have known at that time. \"The document is crucial to the prosecution's case and quite plainly it has been deliberately pre-dated,\" Mr Weill-Raynal said. \"This amounts to forgery of public documents and the defence reserves the right to file a formal complaint on those grounds.\" The appeal is scheduled to be heard on January 12. The case, which has threatened to blow the lid off France's shady secret dealings with its former colonies during the Mitterrand era, has dragged in several well-known names, including a top presidential adviser, Jacques Attali; Charles Pasqua, a former interior minister; Jean-Charles Marchiani, a senior state official; and a best-selling author, Paul-Loup Sulitzer. Mr Mitterrand, who was his father's senior adviser on African affairs from 1986 to 1992, was arrested and jailed earlier this month on suspicion of peddling influence, complicity in arms trafficking, and abuse of funds relating to sales of Russian-made weapons to Angola in the early 1990s. The deals, worth an estimated \u00a3350m, were allegedly orchestrated by Mr Falcone's trading company, Brenco International - which subsequently paid some \u00a31.3m into Jean-Christophe Mitterrand's numbered Swiss bank account. Police believe the late president's son - whose secretive and controversial role as head of the Elys\u00e9e palace's \"Africa cell\" gave him outstanding contacts with a variety of African leaders - played a key part in the Angola deals, and maybe others. Mr Mitterrand has said the money represented fees for legitimate consultancy work. Mr Weill-Raynal said the contested document had allowed the investigating magistrate, Philippe Courroye, to search the offices of a well-known Paris tax lawyer, Alain Guilloux, and eventually to place Mr Mitterrand and several other suspects under investigation. But, the lawyer alleged, it contained evidence that the magistrate could only have known about after the offices were searched. A Paris appeals court last week rejected a request from Mr Mitterrand, 54, to be released on bail.

      "body": "<p>So they're 50, those country folk whose everyday tales provide a ghostly link across two continents and between three generations of my family. One of those generations is now as much a memory as Grace Archer, Mark Hebden and poor old Jethro Larkin. You see, my mother died 13 years ago of breast cancer (how I cried when Ruth found that lump). </p> <p>The family connection goes much further back than that, though. I was born four months after the terrible twins, Shula and Kenton Archer, so I can calibrate my life against their fallings out and in. It is true that I don't have a farm to squabble over; I haven't lost my husband to a tree; I didn't, for that matter, have a twin - but what are the details of mortality when set against the great fiction of parity in age? I remember the death of Grace Archer as if it were yesterday: all that shouting; the roar of the flames; the frantic neighing of horses. </p> <p>Well, truth be told, I don't remember it at all. It was passed down to me by my mother, as part of the family anecdotage - alongside fond recollections of how I lost my first tooth, or when my brother locked himself in the loo all day. In Nigeria, where my mother found herself with two small children, the Archers represented a connection with home in those unimaginable days before email, when telegrams were reserved for births and deaths, and a letter would take a fortnight to arrive. </p> <p>My father's connection with the series was more tangential. He never had much time for radio, but he once wrote a Nigerian version of the Archers to encourage farmers, in what we loftily referred to as \"the bush\", to adopt modern farming methods. Once a week, both my parents would retreat to the study - he to write his scripts, and she to pen crinkly blue airmail letters to the grannies. </p> <p>This was in the early 70s, at pretty much the same time that the real Archers abandoned its founding principle to educate. Since my father worked in the cigarette industry, he was - with an irony he would never have recognised - presumably exhorting those poor, benighted farmers in Nigeria to grow bigger, more lucrative tobacco crops. </p> <p>It is an irony that certainly would be recognised by the latterday Archers cognoscenti, for isn't BSE - the destroyer of Ambridge's cattle wealth - the product of an over-intensive farming industry that was directly encouraged by Godfrey Baseley, the first producer of the Archers, in his revolutionary new agriprop programme? As my mother often told me, when the first episode of the Archers went out, on January 1 1951, Britain was still in rationing, with farmers being exhorted to produce more, by whatever means, in order to feed the nation. </p> <p>It's not that I attribute any guilt to Baseley (any more than I blame my father for the evils of the multinational tobacco industry). It is just a poignant reminder that simply by surviving in this frantic, mouse-brained world of ours, you become part of history - and history is never innocent. </p> <p>I began listening regularly to the Archers as a student in the late 70s. My flatmate - a clever, agricultural student - regarded those struggling tenant farmers, the Grundys, as clowns, and they delighted her with their incompetence. At that time, Eddie and Joe were at the bottom of the heap, with the gentleman farmer Brian Aldridge at the top, the good yeoman Phil Archer at the centre and the scatterbrained Tony Archer and his wayward wife, Pat, drifting somewhere below the middle. It was a comfortably conservative model of a society that knew its heirs from its disgraces. </p> <p>Today, the Grundys are finished, and we see it as a terrible injustice. Phil - the middle-scale owner-farmer - is lost in agricultural limbo (the only way to save his farm, he is told, is to specialise, intensify or to sub-contract. Where does that leave the countryside? Where the next generation?). You can't look to landowning Brian for a way out - he is little more than a puppet, controlled by an asset-stripping conglomerate. </p> <p>It is Tony and Pat (particularly yoghurt queen Pat) who are emerging as the success story: the waywardness of the 70s has become the flexibility of the millennial marketplace. My old flatmate - if she works in agriculture at all - is probably into organic vegetables. She would barely recognise the orthodoxy she once represented. </p> <p>A soap, though, doesn't simply exist in a historical space; it provides a way of tallying that space with our own personal experience. I don't listen to the Archers every day - it drifts through my consciousness along with the ironing and the tax return, which always becomes urgent at about the time that the first lambs arrive at Home Farm. </p> <p>But I feel that I know exactly what is going on, and I am following Ruth's cancer plotline avidly. It is oddly reassuring to be informed that the side-effects of chemotherapy are so much more controllable today than they were when my mother gave it up as a fate, literally, worse than death. (You will notice that I am suffering from a well-known symptom of Archersitis - my primary identification is with the characters whose stories most closely reflect my own.) </p> <p>It is only when you stand back and look at what this information actually represents - at best a case study, at worst a nice solo turn for the actors involved in playing the characters - that the mendacity of the whole exercise becomes clear. But whose mendacity is it? Why should any soap (a word, incidentally, not invented in 1951) be burdened with representing the world? Does the fact that the Archers runs in daily doses - rather like a chat over the garden fence with the neighbours, only with a repeat in case you missed it the first time - mean that it is aspiring to the condition of \"real life\"? </p> <p>You certainly wouldn't think so if you happened to have listened in to the preparations for the Christmas show, which traditionally unfold like a rather long and woozy cast party, but this year seem to have acquired Shakespearean pretensions, with tiffing lovers and revenge capers. </p> <p>The chief quality any long-running soap opera has in common with its listeners is an ability to move with the times. The producers of the Archers have certainly bought into post-modern archness. They play a mean hand in the ratings war, with dramatic deaths, shower scenes and even guest appearances by royalty to offset their continuing earnest approach to the issues of the day. Sometimes their plotlines seem to be driven by pure mischief (as when, just as England was settling into Thatcherism, Pat Archer forsook the Express for the Guardian); and sometimes the old propaganda muscle twitches (note the uproar that greeted Ambridge's response to Tony Blair's countryside policy speech early last year). </p> <p>But those are mere details alongside the one immutable fact - the Archers, in real time directly related to our own, is 50 years old. It's tempting to mock, and yet this corny old programme, showing a fairytale rural world, has somehow acquired the right to represent not what we are, but what we would like to think we are. As a Londoner, I buy deep-frozen New Zealand lamb and make summer pudding in winter. But in Ambridge, there will always be lambing season and blackberry-picking. That is how we like it. </p> <p><strong>The story so far ... 50 years of life in Ambridge</strong><br><strong>Oliver Burkeman</strong></p> <p><strong> 1950s</strong> </p> <p> As the last gasps of feudalism give way to commercial farming, the squire of the Ambridge estate sells up. One Daniel Archer buys Brookfield Farm, while his son and daughter-in-law, Jack and Peggy, snap up the Bull, a local watering-hole. An eventful decade follows, featuring - among other fine moments - the crashing of a jet aeroplane into a nearby field and the accidental shooting dead of a poacher by Dan's cousin, Tom Forrest. But it's the tragic, 1955 death of young, beautiful Grace Fairbrother in a stable fire that stuns most listeners and plunges her suitor, Lothario-of-the-haystacks, Phil Archer - another of Dan's progeny - into mourning. </p> <p> <strong> 1960s</strong> </p> <p> Phil buys his first herd of cows, takes over Allard's farm, moves there with his new wife, Jill, and thus begins his lengthy transformation from thrusting representative of the agricultural future to crotchety old farmer. Sid Perks arrives in Ambridge to work for self-made businessman Jack Woolley, who later buys the estate. Jack Archer's daughter Jennifer gives birth to her first child, by a local farmhand, and Sid's new wife Polly suffers a miscarriage after she's caught up in a raid at the post office. Unconnectedly, a spate of mysterious arson attacks is eventually attributed to her father, Frank Mead, who is hospitalised. </p> <p> <strong> 1970s</strong> </p> <p> A highly localised economic boom strikes Ambridge: Jack Woolley opens his Grey Gables country club; Sid and Polly take over the Bull and hire promiscuous barmaid Caroline Bone, while the enterprising Sid also provides the basis for many a plotline by restarting the village cricket club. But things turn nasty when Jack is assaulted during a robbery, then suffers a heart attack on hearing that his wife, Valerie, wants a divorce. Kenton - son of Phil and Jill, twin brother of local horse enthusiast Shula, and brother of young farmer David and airhead Elizabeth - leaves to join the merchant navy. Garrulous rogue Eddie Grundy moves in with his father Joe at Grange Farm. </p> <p> <strong> 1980s</strong> </p> <p> As greed-is-good ultracapitalism sweeps the rest of the country, Ambridge folk concentrate on getting married (Eddie to Clarrie Larkin; Neil Carter to the already-pregnant Susan Horrobin; Sid, after Polly's car crashes into a milk tanker, to newcomer Kathy Holland), or just having affairs (Kathy Perks with local policeman Dave Barry, and Caroline with businessman-farmer Brian Aldridge, Jennifer's husband). Useless dairy farmer Mike Tucker is declared bankrupt, and busybody Linda Snell moves into Ambridge Hall. </p> <p> <strong> 1990s/2000</strong> </p> <p> Events progress at breakneck speed, tragically breaking several necks in the process. Shady Scot Cameron Fraser purchases the estate, gets Elizabeth pregnant then abandons her in a motorway service station; she has a traumatising abortion. Jack Woolley marries Peggy Archer; Guy Pemberton becomes the new owner of the estate and the new love of Caroline, who - despite being seriously injured in the horse-car collision which kills Shula's husband Mark Hebden - manages to romance him and marry him, whereupon he dies of a heart attack. </p> <p>Shula, after years of IVF treatment, gives birth to Daniel, her son by her dead husband, and Borcheshire's most luckless post office is raided again, this time by local good-for-nothing Clive Horrobin, whose sister Susan (now Carter) is jailed for six months for harbouring him, sparking national outrage. Ethnic diversity makes a token appearance in the form of lawyer Usha Gupta, whose partner Richard Locke ruins things by having an affair with Shula. </p> <p>Tragedy strikes as John Archer - son of grouchy farmer Tony Archer - is killed when his tractor overturns; his brother Tom gets into no end of trouble for trampling crops on Brian's farm. Sid has an affair with line-dancing enthusiast Jolene then dumps Kathy for her, general fecklessness forces the Grundys temporarily into a Borchester tower block, and the vexed question of which Archers are going to inherit Brookfield splits Phil's family down the middle. It is also rumoured that, in between all this, some farming was undertaken.</p>",

As a Londoner, I buy deep-frozen New Zealand lamb and make summer pudding in winter. But in Ambridge, there will always be lambing season and blackberry-picking. That is how we like it. The story so far ... 50 years of life in Ambridge Oliver Burkeman 1950s As the last gasps of feudalism give way to commercial farming, the squire of the Ambridge estate sells up. One Daniel Archer buys Brookfield Farm, while his son and daughter-in-law, Jack and Peggy, snap up the Bull, a local watering-hole. An eventful decade follows, featuring - among other fine moments - the crashing of a jet aeroplane into a nearby field and the accidental shooting dead of a poacher by Dan's cousin, Tom Forrest. But it's the tragic, 1955 death of young, beautiful Grace Fairbrother in a stable fire that stuns most listeners and plunges her suitor, Lothario-of-the-haystacks, Phil Archer - another of Dan's progeny - into mourning. 1960s Phil buys his first herd of cows, takes over Allard's farm, moves there with his new wife, Jill, and thus begins his lengthy transformation from thrusting representative of the agricultural future to crotchety old farmer. Sid Perks arrives in Ambridge to work for self-made businessman Jack Woolley, who later buys the estate. Jack Archer's daughter Jennifer gives birth to her first child, by a local farmhand, and Sid's new wife Polly suffers a miscarriage after she's caught up in a raid at the post office. Unconnectedly, a spate of mysterious arson attacks is eventually attributed to her father, Frank Mead, who is hospitalised. 1970s A highly localised economic boom strikes Ambridge: Jack Woolley opens his Grey Gables country club; Sid and Polly take over the Bull and hire promiscuous barmaid Caroline Bone, while the enterprising Sid also provides the basis for many a plotline by restarting the village cricket club. But things turn nasty when Jack is assaulted during a robbery, then suffers a heart attack on hearing that his wife, Valerie, wants a divorce. Kenton - son of Phil and Jill, twin brother of local horse enthusiast Shula, and brother of young farmer David and airhead Elizabeth - leaves to join the merchant navy. Garrulous rogue Eddie Grundy moves in with his father Joe at Grange Farm. 1980s As greed-is-good ultracapitalism sweeps the rest of the country, Ambridge folk concentrate on getting married (Eddie to Clarrie Larkin; Neil Carter to the already-pregnant Susan Horrobin; Sid, after Polly's car crashes into a milk tanker, to newcomer Kathy Holland), or just having affairs (Kathy Perks with local policeman Dave Barry, and Caroline with businessman-farmer Brian Aldridge, Jennifer's husband). Useless dairy farmer Mike Tucker is declared bankrupt, and busybody Linda Snell moves into Ambridge Hall. 1990s/2000 Events progress at breakneck speed, tragically breaking several necks in the process. Shady Scot Cameron Fraser purchases the estate, gets Elizabeth pregnant then abandons her in a motorway service station; she has a traumatising abortion. Jack Woolley marries Peggy Archer; Guy Pemberton becomes the new owner of the estate and the new love of Caroline, who - despite being seriously injured in the horse-car collision which kills Shula's husband Mark Hebden - manages to romance him and marry him, whereupon he dies of a heart attack. Shula, after years of IVF treatment, gives birth to Daniel, her son by her dead husband, and Borcheshire's most luckless post office is raided again, this time by local good-for-nothing Clive Horrobin, whose sister Susan (now Carter) is jailed for six months for harbouring him, sparking national outrage. Ethnic diversity makes a token appearance in the form of lawyer Usha Gupta, whose partner Richard Locke ruins things by having an affair with Shula. Tragedy strikes as John Archer - son of grouchy farmer Tony Archer - is killed when his tractor overturns; his brother Tom gets into no end of trouble for trampling crops on Brian's farm. Sid has an affair with line-dancing enthusiast Jolene then dumps Kathy for her, general fecklessness forces the Grundys temporarily into a Borchester tower block, and the vexed question of which Archers are going to inherit Brookfield splits Phil's family down the middle. It is also rumoured that, in between all this, some farming was undertaken.",

      "bodyText": "The Ghanaian president, Jerry Rawlings, wished his newly elected successor, the opposition leader John Kufuor, well yesterday, a week before he steps down after two decades in power. At a ceremony marking the anniversary of his 1981 coup, Mr Rawlings pledged to do everything possible to ensure a smooth transition. \"Let me seize this opportunity to congratulate Mr Kufuor on his election,\" he said in an address broadcast to the nation. \"I wish him well and hope he and his colleagues will be able to deliver their promises.\" Mr Kufuor's victory in the December 28 presidential run-off over the vice-president, John Atta Mills, marks the first real transfer of power through the ballot box in the west African country. A two-term limit on presidents prevented Mr Rawlings contesting the election himself. Ghana's history since independence in 1957 - political instability, army rule, bloody purges, socialist central planning, democracy and free mar ket reforms - has mirrored the experience of many other African countries. The election, following a peaceful transfer of power through the ballot box in fellow west African state Senegal last March, brought good news to the continent at the end of a turbulent year in many places. Mr Rawlings first seized power in 1979 as a junior army officer. He handed back power to an elected president later that year but launched a second coup in 1981 when his successor appeared unable to stem resurgent corruption.",

The first one appeared in the Manchester Guardian, as it was then, in the first days of 1951, when George VI was on the throne and Clement Attlee the Prime Minister. It was two years before Tony Blair was born.</p> <p>There have been 1,300 of my diaries altogether - most of them about hills, sunlit snows, clouds suddenly swept away from a ridge, and the dale, far below, leaping up at you, exciting climbing and skiing days, long days walking the tops, mountain views, golden eagles, red deer and many other important things. Hundreds of people have written to me about these simple pieces and their letters encouraged me to carry on.</p> <p>All the articles - except for a handful from the Alps and the Rockies - were written from a succession of homes in and around Kendal that always looked out to the hills. Indeed, from the windows of one home, from which 30 years of diaries were written, I could at one time - before Whitehall messed about with the counties - see hills in four counties.</p> <p>Father Time, though, is unforgiving. I kept up my rock-climbing until I was 78, and carried on skiing until I was 80, but today I just potter about the hills - mostly little ones - in geriatric fashion. I know where to go for quietude when the district is choc-a-bloc with traffic, but my greatest concern will always be that Lakeland is not further despoiled by the excesses of mass tourism and the greed of big business. May I wish you all a wonderful New Year in the hills.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Today's diary exactly completes 50 years of my contributions from the loveliest corner of England, the Lake District. The first one appeared in the Manchester Guardian, as it was then, in the first days of 1951, when George VI was on the throne and Clement Attlee the Prime Minister. It was two years before Tony Blair was born. There have been 1,300 of my diaries altogether - most of them about hills, sunlit snows, clouds suddenly swept away from a ridge, and the dale, far below, leaping up at you, exciting climbing and skiing days, long days walking the tops, mountain views, golden eagles, red deer and many other important things. Hundreds of people have written to me about these simple pieces and their letters encouraged me to carry on. All the articles - except for a handful from the Alps and the Rockies - were written from a succession of homes in and around Kendal that always looked out to the hills. Indeed, from the windows of one home, from which 30 years of diaries were written, I could at one time - before Whitehall messed about with the counties - see hills in four counties. Father Time, though, is unforgiving. I kept up my rock-climbing until I was 78, and carried on skiing until I was 80, but today I just potter about the hills - mostly little ones - in geriatric fashion. I know where to go for quietude when the district is choc-a-bloc with traffic, but my greatest concern will always be that Lakeland is not further despoiled by the excesses of mass tourism and the greed of big business. May I wish you all a wonderful New Year in the hills.",

Outside, the desolate Soviet streets of this former military zone are virtually empty. Towards the outskirts of the town, a few lone figures are visible herding bony cattle past iron-roofed shacks to look for water.</p> <p>Beyond these buildings, there is nothing for miles in any direction but the scrubby wasteland of the Uzbek desert, parched still further by the worst drought the region has ever experienced. Not many people here have time to think about art.</p> <p>But within the walls of its modest two-storey building, the town gallery hoards one of the world's greatest, almost unknown, collections of Soviet art from the 20s and 30s. It contains state-approved socialist realism alongside dissident, decadent art repressed and rejected by the communist regime. Many of the artists shown here were sent to mental hospitals, died in the gulag labour camps, or were executed during Stalin's purges. Until the freedom that came with Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, their work was never hung on the walls of Moscow's leading galleries.</p> <p>It was only because of the remote location of the Nukus museum - in a far-flung central Asian backwater, hundreds of miles from Moscow and even from Tashkent, capital of the now independent state of Uzbekistan - that these pictures could be shown here. Created by an eccentric, fanatical collector, Igor Savitsky, this highly unusual museum helped to preserve the work of artists which otherwise would have been lost for ever. Savitsky was able to build up a collection that could never have been formed in regions more accessible to the watchful eye of the KGB.</p> <p>Long forgotten, the gallery has only recently begun to gain international recognition - and the sudden excitement over this discovery has manifested itself in somewhat surreal fashion. In 1998, 85 American art historians and dealers chartered a private jet to fly from New York to the tiny, dusty Nukus airfield. Photographs, fading and curling in the heat, of these expensively dressed, bemused-looking sophisticates arriving at the museum have been pinned to a noticeboard in the entrance hall. Conscious of how desirable this era of Soviet art has become, some of them had hoped to buy up a few of the 90,000 pieces in the Savitsky collection. The offers were rejected.</p> <p>Al Gore was one of the first foreigners to see the collection, drawn to Nukus by the region's only other sightseeing attraction - the Aral Sea, the world's worst ecological disaster spot, an hour's drive away. He came to study the effects of the catastrophe - caused when Soviet planners diverted the nearby Amu Darya river to irrigate cotton fields - and spent his spare time in the gallery, describing the collection as remarkable.</p> <p>The museum interior is unlike most galleries. Savitsky did not believe in giving paintings space. Every wall is crammed from floor to ceiling. The pictures - some roughly framed in wood, others unframed - are strung up with what appears to be white plastic garden twine. Thousands more paintings are stacked in long rows in darkened storerooms in the basement.</p> <p>The ceilings are patched with board and brown water stains trickle down the walls. There is such a confusion of images that it is at first hard to focus, but image after image catches the eye: the self-portrait by Vladimir Lysenko against a background of constructivist shapes; workers labouring within a scene of smoking factories by Alexander Shevchenko; beautiful, disfigured dead parrots painted by Mikhail Sokolov on his return from the gulag.</p> <p>Some of the artists, such as Robert Falk and Lyubova Popova, are familiar names. Others fell so out of favour with the establishment that they were forgotten and never made it into the canon of Soviet art.</p> <p>Marinika Babanazarova, who became curator after Savitsky's death, describes the museum as \"the most objective evaluation of artistic life at the beginning of the 20th century in the Soviet Union\". She also claims that it is the second best gallery of Russian avant-garde in the world after the Russian Museum in St Petersburg and while it is hard to gauge the accuracy of this claim, the sheer volume and range of the artists gathered here make it an undeniably serious collection.</p> <p>The extraordinary story of Savitsky's museum highlights the history of art in the 20s and 30s and the trials of Russia's artists in the post-revolutionary era.</p> <p>Born into a rich, aristocratic family in 1915, Savitsky trained as an artist and later moved to Uzbekistan, where he, like many other artists of his generation, felt inspired. Concerned that the traditions and folklore of the region were swiftly disappearing beneath the new Soviet culture, he talked the authorities into letting him set up a museum to preserve local crafts.</p> <p>It was beneath the cover of this eminently respectable venture that he was able, in the early 60s, to begin the dangerous task of collecting the works of dissidents. In 1966 he persuaded the Uzbek government to allocate funds to set up a separate art museum - where he discreetly displayed the nonconformist paintings amid more acceptable Moscow artists and local painters. He focused on the period immediately after the revolution through to the 30s - an era which saw the development of the Russian avant-garde, with its explosion of experimental styles: cubism, futurism and constructivism. It was in 1932, with the succession of socialist realism, that all but the most mainstream art, dedicated to glorifying the achievements of Soviet society and boosting the regime, was outlawed. Any deviation from the socialist realist norm was regarded with deep suspicion.</p> <p>With a shrewd eye for unconventional talent, Savitsky began to gather works by many artists who, excluded from Russia's art establishment when experimental art ceased to be tolerated, were denied membership to the all-important artists' union (and the privileges of cheap materials, meals and studio space that went with it) and left to struggle alone. These artists were never given the opportunity to exhibit and as a result their work was rarely bought; they never received lucrative commissions from museums and public galleries or orders to decorate public buildings. Most died unrecognised.</p> <p>Savitsky began travelling regularly to Moscow, where he would persuade widows and families of dissident artists to sell him work. As late as the 60s, the avant-garde remained outside the bounds of acceptability in the Soviet Union and many paintings had lain abandoned for decades, rotting in attics and basements, lying in dusty piles beneath beds and behind bookshelves. One work was extracted from the rafters, where it had been placed to keep out the rain.</p> <p>Most of the relatives were so delighted that someone was finally prepared to put the work on show that they were thrilled to part with the paintings. Those who were reluctant soon changed their minds after a taste of Savitsky's notorious charm. He became known as the widows' friend.</p> <p>Savitsky used to travel back to Nukus by train - a wearying three-day trip from the capital - with his compartment and several others crammed with canvases. The money granted to him by the Uzbek authorities did not stretch to buying works by artists such as Kazimir Malevich and Marc Chagall who were famous abroad, but he paid reasonable prices for the works of forgotten artists. He was a hoarder who liked to take everything away with him so that, he said, visitors to his museum would be able to see the development of an artist's talent. Handwritten files in the museum archives show that several artists are represented by more than 1,000 pieces each.</p> <p>Until perestroika, museum staff never advertised the presence of these nonconformist artists within the collection - which also houses a fine collection of socialist realism. They were reluctant to draw attention to something that would only cause trouble. To people who knew anything about art, the remarkable diversity of the collection was immediately obvious and it became quietly famous in dissident circles. Apart from one occasion - when a KGB officer inexplicably decided that an innocuous picture of a bull by Lysenko was anti-Soviet and demanded that it be removed - security officials left the museum alone.</p> <p>In 1982, when the museum held an exhibition of drawings by Nadezhda Borovaya from the gulag where she spent seven years in the 30s, the catalogue informed visitors that the pictures were imaginary representations of life inside a German concentration camp. The drawings, made on scraps of rough brown paper and smuggled out of the camp, showed emaciated prisoners with cadaverous faces. One picture shows a mother carrying her dead child, another shows women with strips of cloth wrapped around their heads marked with their identity numbers.</p> <p>\"Most people didn't know that the Soviet Union had deprived people of their identities like that,\" says Babanazarova. \"It was thought that that was something done only by the fascists. The pictures would never have gone on show - even in Nukus - if we had said they had depicted life in a Russian gulag.\"</p> <p>Savitsky's collection has regained acceptability and popularity over the last decade, but the museum faces financial problems. Staff fight a constant battle against the harsh elements of the desert. There is no money to buy humidifiers. Instead staff arrive at dawn every morning, open all the windows and place trays of water on the wooden floorboards of every room to stop the arid air cracking the paint. The heat is so fierce that by mid-morning the water has evaporated.</p> <p>Because of the ecological disaster, the Aral Sea region has been registered as the dustiest place on the planet and the dried-up seabed lets loose a daily storm of sand and toxins which also threaten the pictures. Every time it rains, staff have to rush to carry canvases from rooms with leaks to those that are watertight.</p> <p>With several paintings worth more than \u00a31m, around 70% of the annual state grant goes on maintaining an alarm system within the converted government office block that houses the museum. It was long ago deemed unsatisfactory and work on a new building began in 1976. The still-unfinished structure, a great hulk of concrete, stands in the town's central square. An extravagant flight of stairs to the main entrance has been completed, but the rest is a shell. There is no sign of construction work. \"The government granted us \u00a35m this year for the building, but we need \u00a3625m,\" says Babanazarova. \"At this rate it will be at least another 60 years before we can meet the cost of it.\"</p> <p>Most visitors are tourists. \"People who live here are concerned with the problem of survival, not with culture. It is very difficult to think about art when your stomach is empty,\" she says. But Nukus is not exactly a top tourist destination. A former high-security centre for the development of chemical weapons, it was closed to foreigners entirely until the late 80s and since then there has been little reason to develop the place for tourists. There are no restaurants, not even in the main hotel; just a few roadside food stalls.</p> <p>Babanazarova wonders sometimes about moving the gallery from its current remote position in one of the world's more remote locations to a spot more accessible to visitors. \"Evacuation would make sense because more people would be able to see the exhibition and that would attract more financial support. But we don't even want to think about it,\" she says. \"This was the place that gave shelter to these artists in a hard time. It would be a betrayal to move them now.\"</p>",

Most died unrecognised. Savitsky began travelling regularly to Moscow, where he would persuade widows and families of dissident artists to sell him work. As late as the 60s, the avant-garde remained outside the bounds of acceptability in the Soviet Union and many paintings had lain abandoned for decades, rotting in attics and basements, lying in dusty piles beneath beds and behind bookshelves. One work was extracted from the rafters, where it had been placed to keep out the rain. Most of the relatives were so delighted that someone was finally prepared to put the work on show that they were thrilled to part with the paintings. Those who were reluctant soon changed their minds after a taste of Savitsky's notorious charm. He became known as the widows' friend. Savitsky used to travel back to Nukus by train - a wearying three-day trip from the capital - with his compartment and several others crammed with canvases. The money granted to him by the Uzbek authorities did not stretch to buying works by artists such as Kazimir Malevich and Marc Chagall who were famous abroad, but he paid reasonable prices for the works of forgotten artists. He was a hoarder who liked to take everything away with him so that, he said, visitors to his museum would be able to see the development of an artist's talent. Handwritten files in the museum archives show that several artists are represented by more than 1,000 pieces each. Until perestroika, museum staff never advertised the presence of these nonconformist artists within the collection - which also houses a fine collection of socialist realism. They were reluctant to draw attention to something that would only cause trouble. To people who knew anything about art, the remarkable diversity of the collection was immediately obvious and it became quietly famous in dissident circles. Apart from one occasion - when a KGB officer inexplicably decided that an innocuous picture of a bull by Lysenko was anti-Soviet and demanded that it be removed - security officials left the museum alone. In 1982, when the museum held an exhibition of drawings by Nadezhda Borovaya from the gulag where she spent seven years in the 30s, the catalogue informed visitors that the pictures were imaginary representations of life inside a German concentration camp. The drawings, made on scraps of rough brown paper and smuggled out of the camp, showed emaciated prisoners with cadaverous faces. One picture shows a mother carrying her dead child, another shows women with strips of cloth wrapped around their heads marked with their identity numbers. \"Most people didn't know that the Soviet Union had deprived people of their identities like that,\" says Babanazarova. \"It was thought that that was something done only by the fascists. The pictures would never have gone on show - even in Nukus - if we had said they had depicted life in a Russian gulag.\" Savitsky's collection has regained acceptability and popularity over the last decade, but the museum faces financial problems. Staff fight a constant battle against the harsh elements of the desert. There is no money to buy humidifiers. Instead staff arrive at dawn every morning, open all the windows and place trays of water on the wooden floorboards of every room to stop the arid air cracking the paint. The heat is so fierce that by mid-morning the water has evaporated. Because of the ecological disaster, the Aral Sea region has been registered as the dustiest place on the planet and the dried-up seabed lets loose a daily storm of sand and toxins which also threaten the pictures. Every time it rains, staff have to rush to carry canvases from rooms with leaks to those that are watertight. With several paintings worth more than \u00a31m, around 70% of the annual state grant goes on maintaining an alarm system within the converted government office block that houses the museum. It was long ago deemed unsatisfactory and work on a new building began in 1976. The still-unfinished structure, a great hulk of concrete, stands in the town's central square. An extravagant flight of stairs to the main entrance has been completed, but the rest is a shell. There is no sign of construction work. \"The government granted us \u00a35m this year for the building, but we need \u00a3625m,\" says Babanazarova. \"At this rate it will be at least another 60 years before we can meet the cost of it.\" Most visitors are tourists. \"People who live here are concerned with the problem of survival, not with culture. It is very difficult to think about art when your stomach is empty,\" she says. But Nukus is not exactly a top tourist destination. A former high-security centre for the development of chemical weapons, it was closed to foreigners entirely until the late 80s and since then there has been little reason to develop the place for tourists. There are no restaurants, not even in the main hotel; just a few roadside food stalls. Babanazarova wonders sometimes about moving the gallery from its current remote position in one of the world's more remote locations to a spot more accessible to visitors. \"Evacuation would make sense because more people would be able to see the exhibition and that would attract more financial support. But we don't even want to think about it,\" she says. \"This was the place that gave shelter to these artists in a hard time. It would be a betrayal to move them now.\"",

There is evidence that Mozart sometimes longed for a more nurturing musical father - as in the effusive dedication of his six \"Haydn\" Quartets to Joseph Haydn (46 years his senior, hugely influential and a much more benign figure than Leopold). But in terms of craft and vocation, Mozart was a chip off the paternal block. </p> <p>Beethoven - canonised as music's greatest iconoclast and innovator - was son and grandson of musicians. Like Leopold Mozart, Beethoven's father Johann planned to capitalise on his son's talents. He was also coarse, violent and an incurable drunk. There are stories of him dragging little Ludwig out of bed after the taverns had closed to perform for his disreputable friends; and if Ludwig's playing wasn't felt to be up to standard, beatings followed. It's possible the effects of Johann's behaviour reverberated in Beethoven's feelings about God the Father. As the conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch put it, trying to explain why Beethoven's Missa Solemnis leaves a complex impression: \"I'm not sure he always thought God was such a good thing.\" </p> <p>Still, when it comes to musical family firms, the name Bach admits no competition. According to surviving records there were something like 75 musician Bachs. Johann Sebastian - the composer Beethoven referred to as \"the immortal god of harmony\" - drew up a genealogy, identifying Veit Bach (d. 1619), baker and lutenist, as the founder of the dynasty. JS Bach may be the star name in the family tree, but he had distinguished predecessors - great-uncle Johann Christoph, for instance, creator of several expressive choral works. </p> <p>JS Bach is sometimes pigeonholed as a conservative, intensifying his essentially baroque style while the rest of the musical world edged towards romanticism. That would fit with the notion of a composer proudly inheriting a dynastic tradition, rather than striking out for new shores. But the truth is more complicated. And anyway, one of Bach's most talented sons, Carl Philipp Emanuel - as much product and upholder of Bachian family values as his father - became one of the most forward-looking, iconoclastic composers of the 18th century. </p> <p>It was CPE Bach that Haydn had in mind when he wrote: \"Bach is the father, we the children.\" Or, as CPE wrote of his father, JS: \"He, who possessed the most profound knowledge of all the contrapuntal arts, understood how to make art subservient to beauty.\" In other words, the revolutionary learned innovation at the workbench of his apparently conservative, solidly pedagogical father: not the way it's supposed to happen. </p> <p>The Bachs may be the outstanding musical family, but they weren't the last. The 19th century saw the rise of the Strausses of Vienna - composers and performers all. Johann Strauss I tried to prevent his sons from making a career in music, but Johann II, \"The Waltz King\", studied in secret and entered the musical scene as a rival to his father. They also ended up supporting opposite political sides in the revolutions of 1848 - Johann II being on the side of the revolutionaries. A classic Oedipal conflict. Perhaps the Bachs were, after all, a weird, unrepeatable anomaly. </p> <p>Although in our own time there are examples of families with more than one composer under one roof, it is much more common to find multiple-performer families. Steven Isserlis can make up a string quartet with other members of his family, as can fellow cellist Tim Hugh. Musical family ensembles have also entered popular mythology via The Sound of Music's Von Trapps. Many of us will have seen something similar in real life: kids clutching half-sized string instruments being herded out of the people carrier, primed for exhibition at the next school concert. </p> <p>There's something disturbing about such spectacles. Was it luck that those three children chose violin, viola and cello respectively, or was the choice made for them? The latter ought to be a recipe for disaster, although avoiding having two children playing the same instrument can be good psychological strategy. </p> <p>No doubt it is a help for a musician to grow up in a house where music is in the air. But the history of musical families is strewn with casualties, victims of hothouse teaching or internecine strife. Even the survivors can provide notes of warning. The conductor Leonard Slatkin had famous musical parents. His father, Felix Slatkin, partly trained as a conductor but became famous as a violinist and as founder/leader of the Hollywood String Quartet, and his mother, Eleanor Aller, was cellist in the Hollywood. Not following his father directly was important, Slatkin has said; significantly it was only when his father died that his career really began to pick up speed. </p> <p>There are tales of open rivalry between conductors Erich (father) and Carlos (son) Kleiber. Damning parental criticism may not have prevented Carlos Kleiber from achieving greatness, but it may have helped turn him into the bizarre recluse he has become. Yan Pascal Tortelier was wise not to follow the same course as his world-famous cellist father Paul Tortelier; instead he has established a firm reputation for himself as a conductor. But conductor Maxim Shostakovich, son of one of the biggest names in 20th-century music, hasn't been so lucky. Nor has Igor Oistrakh: a fine violinist, throughout his career he has had to endure comparisons with his legendary violinist father, David Oistrakh. Does he ever wish he'd taken up the tuba? </p> <p>There is a painful testimonial in the film Hilary and Jackie, based on a book by Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9's sister Hilary - a talented flautist whose career collapsed as her sibling's grew, and who found herself duty-bound to continue making sacrifices for brilliant but crazy Jackie (including offering up her own husband for sex). Jackie emerges as a monster, Hilary as a saint. It all smacks of deep hurt and bitter revenge. </p> <p>Still, it's possible to see Hilary and Jackie as a valuable cautionary tale. The idea of gathering your family together to play quartets on balmy summer evenings may appeal. It can even work out well, if the parents are reasonably worldly-wise. But before you try turning your children into performing Mozarts, Von Trapps, or even the Jackson Five, see Hilary and Jackie and think a little harder.</p>",

He experimented with world-musical borrowings and classical/ jazz crossovers when they were otherwise rare. Brubeck intertwined jazz swing with time-signatures that looked like algebra, mingled standard song forms with elegant rondos and fugues. </p> <p>The music flattered and charmed the white middle-class college audience of the day, and for that reason (and its cool articulation and understated dynamics) it was often denounced as a pale recital-room substitute by those who preferred their jazz to get down and break sweat. The late Benny Green, in particular - a mercilessly witty flayer of those he judged to be jazz heretics - was at his most pungent with Brubeck. </p> <p>But time, and the eclecticism and fluid collaborations of a shrinking world, have healed Brubeck's estrangement from the jazz audience. Now his pieces are recognised for the harmonically subtle, melodically devious and original works they are, and his most classically oriented works (such as the soft-winds Bach tribute, Chorale) triumph in a treacherous territory in which short-changing jazz or dumbing-down symphonic composition is very hard to avoid. </p> <p>Brubeck was on stage in London over Christmas, looking a shade stooped and just a little overwhelmed, but playing with a relaxed mischievousness that has grown on him with the years, and with his usual emphatic chordal bounce.

He's had criticism for doing that, and it's hurt him - to this day, it's hard for him to get a good review out of the New York Times, even though he keeps outliving their critics. But his is an amazing story.

Darius is an ethno-musicologist and teacher as well as a performer, Matt is an improvising jazz cellist who tours with Sheryl Crow, and Dan leads a variety of jazz and funk groups of his own. Chris Brubeck has confirmed receipt of his father's broad musical horizons by recording an album of pieces in the LSO's company, ranging from Bach to blues to Brubeck Snr, and featuring his exuberant new Concerto for Bass Trombone (which stimulated interest from more of the world's classical trombonists than its composer had thought even existed). </p> <p>\"The LSO is the best in the world for people like us, who don't belong in any one category,\" says Chris Brubeck. \"They're flexible, open, versatile, and they enjoy it all. But it's also a change that's come out of the economic situation. Orchestral players can't afford to lift their noses to the skies and only play Mahler now - we used to get them going 'Oh my god, a jazz group on stage with us', and they'd look so disgruntled sitting there in their evening dress, like waiters at the end of a slow night. But a new kind of musician has evolved.\" </p> <p>The Brubeck family's mutual pleasure in its work is pretty evident onstage, and all backstage accounts indicate that it isn't just public relations. Part of Chris Brubeck's delight in the 80th birthday shows is down to witnessing his father's continuing participation in the more open musical climate that his career did more than a little to encourage. \"In every culture there's a thing we might call jazz,\" he says. \"This improvised, freer way of making music over a structure, or sometimes not over a structure. It's all coming together with more composed musics as the world shrinks - and it needs to go on developing, even though it's also good to have people such as Wynton Marsalis who want to honour the full range of jazz's deep musical past. </p> <p>\"But Dave saw this coming a long while ago, and he's still unique. There are very few jazz musicians who have gone into the classical world as deeply as he has. When I hear Chorale, it reminds me of the very best of Aaron Copland, something like Appalachian Spring. There's a sort of American honesty to it. When he switched from being a veterinarian major to doing music at the Pacific College in California in the 40s, they told him at the end of the course they were going to flunk him because his sight-reading was terrible. </p> <p>\"But at the same time they were saying he was one of the best music students they'd ever had. In the end they did a deal - they'd give him the degree if he'd promise never to teach. Now they're archiving all his work 60 years later, and he's one of their most famous students. It's a story that characterises him somehow. You can still hear that openness and optimism in him today.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Brubeck's Bach to Brubeck is out on Koch International Classics.

Chris Brubeck has confirmed receipt of his father's broad musical horizons by recording an album of pieces in the LSO's company, ranging from Bach to blues to Brubeck Snr, and featuring his exuberant new Concerto for Bass Trombone (which stimulated interest from more of the world's classical trombonists than its composer had thought even existed). \"The LSO is the best in the world for people like us, who don't belong in any one category,\" says Chris Brubeck. \"They're flexible, open, versatile, and they enjoy it all. But it's also a change that's come out of the economic situation. Orchestral players can't afford to lift their noses to the skies and only play Mahler now - we used to get them going 'Oh my god, a jazz group on stage with us', and they'd look so disgruntled sitting there in their evening dress, like waiters at the end of a slow night. But a new kind of musician has evolved.\" The Brubeck family's mutual pleasure in its work is pretty evident onstage, and all backstage accounts indicate that it isn't just public relations. Part of Chris Brubeck's delight in the 80th birthday shows is down to witnessing his father's continuing participation in the more open musical climate that his career did more than a little to encourage. \"In every culture there's a thing we might call jazz,\" he says. \"This improvised, freer way of making music over a structure, or sometimes not over a structure. It's all coming together with more composed musics as the world shrinks - and it needs to go on developing, even though it's also good to have people such as Wynton Marsalis who want to honour the full range of jazz's deep musical past. \"But Dave saw this coming a long while ago, and he's still unique. There are very few jazz musicians who have gone into the classical world as deeply as he has. When I hear Chorale, it reminds me of the very best of Aaron Copland, something like Appalachian Spring. There's a sort of American honesty to it. When he switched from being a veterinarian major to doing music at the Pacific College in California in the 40s, they told him at the end of the course they were going to flunk him because his sight-reading was terrible. \"But at the same time they were saying he was one of the best music students they'd ever had. In the end they did a deal - they'd give him the degree if he'd promise never to teach. Now they're archiving all his work 60 years later, and he's one of their most famous students. It's a story that characterises him somehow. You can still hear that openness and optimism in him today.\" \u0095 Chris Brubeck's Bach to Brubeck is out on Koch International Classics. Dave Brubeck's solo album, One Alone, is on BMG/Telarc.",

      "body": "<p>I'm knackered. A bit depressed, if you must know. It's not simply the winter cold. Nor the pre-dawn Eurostar trek to Paris, nor the hollow rumble in my belly. Just a feeling in my soul. Even interviewers are prone to existential nausea. Still, in a few minutes I'll be chatting away to a brilliant dramatist, filling my tum with the finest French food, drinking in her famous beauty, feasting my mind on the most elevated French thought. Transcending the blues.</p> <p>Yasmina Reza is not so much a writer as a cultural phenomenon. In an age when we have turned our back on the cack-handed artifice of so much theatre, her most popular play has packed the West End for five years. Art, which is about three male friends who fall out when one of them buys a white canvas for \u00a320,000, has been translated into 35 languages, grossed close on \u00a3200m worldwide and won all the awards worth winning.</p> <p>Her new play, Life x 3, which is about four people falling out as they discuss astrophysics, is playing to bloated crowds at the National Theatre. Her novel, Hammerklavier, which features a woman who falls out with a man because he doesn't like her necklace, has been described as a profound exploration of intimacy.</p> <p>Reza, who is 40, seems to be hiding behind curtains in the bar of a grand St Germain hotel, which was her choice for our meeting. She looks like a Spitting Image puppet, both smaller and larger than life. While her body is petite, with its tiny cotton reel of a waist, her face is exaggerated: huge Vaselined lips; long, dipping nose; great, rolling, brown eyes. Her mother is Hungarian, her father was of Russian-Iranian extraction. She is French and Jewish. Somehow her face maps out her history.</p> <p>She sips at her tea. Her legs are crossed, defensively. Before I know it my host is telling me how rarely she gives interviews, how journalists distort the truth, how tired she is because she is acting in Life x 3, and that combined with the writing, and running a family, looking after her 12-year-old daughter and younger son, giving interviews when you have nothing to say to journalists who will only hear what they want to hear anyway ... If I were more chivalrous I'd apologise for my existence and leave. Instead, I just order myself a sad cup of coffee and fantasise about the gourmet meal that won't be.</p> <p>Reza used to be an actress, and has just returned to the stage for the first time in more than a decade to play Ines in Life x 3. \"It's a surprising role for me to play because Ines is a victim. I'm not considered to be a victim.\" She says she is much closer to the other female lead, Sonia.</p> <p>\"Sonia takes risks, she's a player. She's very complex, very powerful.\"</p> <p>In the play, which offers three versions of the same story, Sonia is having an affair with a successful academic who can make or break the husband she loves, Henri. Reza says the actress playing Sonia in Paris had problems with the role. \"I think you can really love a man and take a lover also. It's not a contradiction for me, and it was very difficult to make the actress understand that. She thought if a girl is capable of embracing both men, she is a bitch, she doesn't love her husband. But things are not so simple. In my view, you can be everything at the same moment. Things are never clear in real life, so why should they be in art?\"</p> <p>She parts her lips and smiles the most sensual of smiles. Reza looks as if she could swallow the world. It's the kind of smile you spend years perfecting in a mirror. She says she has a problem with the way we watch her plays - why do we insist on calling them comedies? I feel a little embarrassed, having left Life x 3 thinking it a farce about an evening in with two unexpected visitors and a bawling toddler. Reza patiently explains the error of my ways. \"It is about the smallest things, like chocolate fingers, trivial domestic stuff, and also it's a metaphysical play. To my mind it's my most metaphysical play.\"</p> <p>That's great, having a metaphysical play about Cheesy Wotsits, I say.</p> <p>\"It's not only about that,\" she says sans smile. \"It's also about stars. There are phases like: 'We are not insignificant ... our time is insignificant, but we are not insignificant.' There are some phrases in this play which I'm very proud of, like: 'Your son has made a wonderful monument and tomorrow he will destroy it. In this world you destroy everything, even yourself.' \"</p> <p>Reza explains that this phrase also has multiple meanings. Yet still the audiences giggle their way through the evening. In Art, they laugh at the way the friends discuss the blank canvas, they laugh at their aspirations and their pretensions, they laugh all the way to the bar, where they discuss whether a blank canvas can be great art. \"Laughter is always a problem,\" Reza says. \"Laughter is very dangerous. The way people laugh changes the way you see a play. A very profound play may seem very light. My plays have always been described as comedy but I think they're tragedy. They are funny tragedy, but they are tragedy. Maybe it's a new genre.\"</p> <p>Why is Art a tragedy? \"Because it is a break-up of a friendship, a rupture between people ... it's a heartbreaking play if you read it.\" Reza has often said she hates false modesty.</p> <p>Her tragic vision of life goes way back. \"I knew as a young child that everyone would die, that humanity was vile. I had no optimism in human beings. I have no faith in humanity. Our first instincts are vile.\"</p> <p>Are her first instincts vile? \"Of course. I try to correct them, every day to improve myself.\" What does she find most vile about herself? \"I will not tell you, of course. Like most people I'm not a special monster, but I'm aware of what I could be if I didn't pay attention to myself.\" As she tells me about our curdled souls, atrophied minds and decaying bodies, I keep wondering when my host is going to ask if I fancy a scrummy little cake to make the interview go down nicely.</p> <p>She says her morality keeps her vileness in check, and refers me to her novel Hammerklavier. \"All the personal questions you ask me are in this book. It is very autobiographical. It was not supposed to be published. It was written for me.\"</p> <p>Why did she agree to its publication? \"One day I realised I had many pages and reread them and I found them very interesting. I made friends read them and they said: 'Really, but you should publish them. It's not as personal as you think because everyone has a father, everyone has children ...' Now I'm very happy it's a book.\"</p> <p>In one of the fragments that make up Hammerklavier, she attends the funeral of her former agent, Marta. The dead Marta tells her off for not bringing flowers, and says she knows why she didn't bother: \"Because your laziness got the better of you and because you didn't think it was worth spending a cent on a dead woman.\" I think I'm going to have a long wait for my cake.</p> <p>Hammerklavier is astonishing. The tiny chapters were written as scraps of diary, and somehow Reza has convinced herself that the act of stapling these scraps together turns them into a cogent work of fiction. It is occasionally beautiful, often pretentious, always revealing. There is plenty of love in the book - for her dying father, staring at his cancer-stripped body in the mirror and seeing Auschwitz; for her children's demanding whims; for her partner, director Didier Martigny. Yet what seeps through is the vileness she sees within herself and the world.</p> <p>Reza becomes her own truest character. At one point she writes about the modern theatre audience with utter contempt. \"Wherever we go today people applaud at the final note. No silence. Not a single second's retreat. Quick, applaud. Quick, show yourself, quick be part of it, talk about it, bawl out your important verdict ... everyone is so proud of belonging to this odious community, the odious new community of the informed, intelligent public.\"</p> <p>I hated Art and Life x 3, and the more I talk to Reza the more I realise why. Reza sits at the top table of the very odious community she condemns. Her plays are the perfect fodder for the chattering classes she claims to despise. The mighty cerebral subjects are simply conceits, showy props. Is she really interested in art or astrophysics? \"Not much, no. I think the subjects are not so important in themselves, only the style, the way you deal with them. That makes a playwright, or not.\" She says the truth lies in the words behind the debates, or the silences; the tragedy in the relationships. Perhaps. But you have to care about characters for their fall to be tragic.</p> <p>A new expression was recently invented to describe the work of Yasmina Reza: \"The big idea lite.\" She finds it insulting, demeaning, and says accessibility has been mistaken for banality. \"I think if people are going to pay to go the theatre, you have to be understood. I don't want to compare myself with the greatest playwrights but Shakespeare, Moli\u00e8re, Racine, all the great ones were very, very accessible. And the fact that they became classics was because they were accessible. My writing is very complex ... but complex and funny, complex and entertaining.\"</p> <p>Does she ever lose confidence in her writing? \"Not at all.\" Reza's words, her tone, her body language all convey an invincibility. Only her eyes suggest otherwise. They are permanently wet, as if on the verge of tears. Does she lose confidence in herself? \"I'm more confident in myself as a writer. I'm not confident in myself at all.\" But as a writer? \"Yes, I am. Very.\" She says that Yasmina Reza the writer is very different from Yasmina Reza the mother, lover, daughter. \"It may not look like it, but I am shy as a person.\" I think I would get on better with Reza the person than Reza the author.</p> <p>Perhaps there is a reason why Reza is so successful today. Maybe her creations have a peculiar resonance in the post-political age. Her characters, including herself in Hammerklavier, are self-obsessed, desperately ambitious for achievement, whatever form that achievement takes. They reek of futility but lack the desperate humanity of Beckett's existential no-hopers.</p> <p>I ask Reza if there is any cause she fights for, anything that makes her scream with outrage. \"No, it's not a way of expressing myself. I don't believe in shouting nowadays, it doesn't work. It was very important to do that when Hitler came to power, but now I don't think there are causes which I could involve myself with. You know, a lot of famous people involve themselves very easily, and I suspect that.\"</p> <p>As she says, she has little faith in humanity.</p> <p>Her created worlds are stiflingly insular, her characters totally self-absorbed. At the end of Hammerklavier, she writes about getting the Eurostar back from London to Paris. She looks out of the window and for a second allows her imagination to stray. \"We pass the sad brick houses alongside the tracks. Who lives in them? Who wakes each morning to look upon this low horizon of bricks, chimneys, and bewildering walls? A few yards ahead, I'll think no more of them. I'll be thinking of the things that are travelling with me and don't leave me. For the world is not outside the self. Outside the self is the illusion of the world, not the world.\"</p> <p>I'm starving.</p> <p>Reza stands up to leave, and asks if I'm staying in Paris. No, I say, I'm getting the Eurostar back later today. She looks pleased. \"Ah, you came just for me?\" Then disappointed. \"It's a pity, you could have come to see me in the play tonight.\" And with that, she disappears.</p> <p>As I gather up my belongings, the waiter catches my eye. \"Ah monsieur, you will be wanting to pay the bill,\" he says.</p>",

And the fact that they became classics was because they were accessible. My writing is very complex ... but complex and funny, complex and entertaining.\" Does she ever lose confidence in her writing? \"Not at all.\" Reza's words, her tone, her body language all convey an invincibility. Only her eyes suggest otherwise. They are permanently wet, as if on the verge of tears. Does she lose confidence in herself? \"I'm more confident in myself as a writer. I'm not confident in myself at all.\" But as a writer? \"Yes, I am. Very.\" She says that Yasmina Reza the writer is very different from Yasmina Reza the mother, lover, daughter. \"It may not look like it, but I am shy as a person.\" I think I would get on better with Reza the person than Reza the author. Perhaps there is a reason why Reza is so successful today. Maybe her creations have a peculiar resonance in the post-political age. Her characters, including herself in Hammerklavier, are self-obsessed, desperately ambitious for achievement, whatever form that achievement takes. They reek of futility but lack the desperate humanity of Beckett's existential no-hopers. I ask Reza if there is any cause she fights for, anything that makes her scream with outrage. \"No, it's not a way of expressing myself. I don't believe in shouting nowadays, it doesn't work. It was very important to do that when Hitler came to power, but now I don't think there are causes which I could involve myself with. You know, a lot of famous people involve themselves very easily, and I suspect that.\" As she says, she has little faith in humanity. Her created worlds are stiflingly insular, her characters totally self-absorbed. At the end of Hammerklavier, she writes about getting the Eurostar back from London to Paris. She looks out of the window and for a second allows her imagination to stray. \"We pass the sad brick houses alongside the tracks. Who lives in them? Who wakes each morning to look upon this low horizon of bricks, chimneys, and bewildering walls? A few yards ahead, I'll think no more of them. I'll be thinking of the things that are travelling with me and don't leave me. For the world is not outside the self. Outside the self is the illusion of the world, not the world.\" I'm starving. Reza stands up to leave, and asks if I'm staying in Paris. No, I say, I'm getting the Eurostar back later today. She looks pleased. \"Ah, you came just for me?\" Then disappointed. \"It's a pity, you could have come to see me in the play tonight.\" And with that, she disappears. As I gather up my belongings, the waiter catches my eye. \"Ah monsieur, you will be wanting to pay the bill,\" he says.",

      "body": "<p>Miss Thrifty, my friend and mentor, is extremely fond of January. Och, she says, stop your moaning. No sunshine means no sunburn on your complexion. And your armpits won't get as sweaty either, in the cold. You save on sunscreen, you save on deodorant. No argument there, then. For stingy women who are prone to vanity, January is clearly great.</p> <p>Like Miss Thrifty, I'm very happy that it's this time of year. I like the bleakness, the emptiness, the quiet. I like the way everything is grey. I dread Christmas - the X-fest, as we call it in my house - so I am delighted that it is finally over. I don't like New Year, either, which is why we call it Hog. Over the season, I don't go on and on about these hatreds. I behave myself, I join in. So now I enter the new year loaded down with Brownie points. As sure as Dionysian revels follow periods of repression, it's time for me to get my fun.</p> <p>The opening rites of January are simple. I make myself a jug of lemon juice in water and a soup of lovely roots. You take onions, carrots, leeks and potatoes. You boil them until they're soft. You add parsley, or a stock cube, or some bonito flakes and miso, if you want to pretend you are eating a 21st-century global-free-trade-type dish. You eat it two or three times daily. You get on with the things that really matter in between.</p> <p>First, you get rid of all your Christmas presents. Apart from the ones you actually like, of course, which probably will be the ones you had to buy them for yourself. In my house, useless-but-neutral presents - soaps and sweetmeats - go into a stiff-sided lockable suitcase until it's time to hand them on to somebody else. Hateful presents - politeness forbids me from going further - go straight to the Barnardo's shop. It's great to see that candle, those sachets, meant so thoughtfully for you, out there among all the other ones on the open shelf.</p> <p>Then you get rid of any tat you have put up around your lodgings. A month ago, I saw these super gingerbread angels in one of London's fancier cake shops, priced a ridiculous \u00a34.95. I decided I could do better. I bought a cutter from John Lewis for 49p. I riffled through the papers and cut out Nigella Lawson's picture byline to stick on with a blob of icing for the angel's face. I enter the New Year with a pile of slightly burnt Mr Blobby biscuits and a heap of curling Nigellas. It breaks my heart to be sweeping them into a bin-bag. It breaks my heart, but I do it just the same.</p> <p>Third, you stave off a winter depression with the aid of Miss Thrifty's two-pronged attack. On the one hand, you partake of regular exercise, anything you like. Just do something you need to take a shower after. That way, you know you're sloughing something off. At the same time, you engage with a nice solid piece of Germanic literature or music. Schubert's Winterreise is excellent, full of snow and heartache and solid structure. Mozart operas are magnificent - psychologists claim to have proved scientifically that Mozart is good for the mind. Rilke works, and so does Goethe.</p> <p>The aim, according to Miss Thrifty, is to keep your brain as spruce as you can. That way it is less likely to slip into a trough.</p> <p>Finally, you find yourself a decent Burns night party to go to. Burns night, January 25, is the sensible person's winter festival. Instead of celebrating the lush lowland England of chubby birds and fruity puddings, Burns night remembers the harsher, bleaker Britain of snow-swept rocky upland slopes. You eat sheep's offal bulked out with oatmeal, mashed swede and mashed potato.</p> <p>You read poems, you sing songs and you dance. Burns night is perfect for people who feel they failed at the X-fest. It's not a lot of bother, boiling a haggis with its neeps and tatties. It's no, as Miss Thrifty says, an awfy lot of expense. It is best of all for those of us who know that we failed because somewhere, in our puritanical heart of hearts, we never really wanted to succeed.</p> <p>January is the month during which all sensible people are content to dwell in darkness, nursing the energies, waiting for the spring. Every horrible day that passes, we're in daylight a little longer. Every cloud, every hailstorm, is a harbinger of the sun. One day soon, you'll see a pallid little shoot emerging. As Miss Thrifty turned to me and said once: you think it's a shrivelled up old onion, it turns out to have been a daffodil all along. <br><b>Jenny Turner</b></p> <p>Christmases: I've seen 35 of them now and I've had enough, more than enough. Roll on January: in fact, roll on February, just to be safe. And don't give me the usual excuses, I've heard them all before - Christmas may be an obscene and degrading celebration of unnecessary consumption, ill-temper and stress, but it's for the kids. Well, I don't have any. Or, no, what we really meant was, it's for the family. Well, I don't have one of those, either. So as far as I'm concerned, Christmas is that special, crispy, imitation snow-spangled time when corrosive isolation meets sterile inadequacy across a field of shitty television and free-floating sentiment, and then has a good stab at reaming out your soul. Which would make my personal motto - Christmas: it's bloody depressing.</p> <p>Traditionalists will point out that Christmas is supposed to be about the baby Jesus and the Wise Men and the little, more or less symbolic, lambs. But if we're going to get genuinely traditional about this, we know the current date for Christmas Day was picked with the sole intention of ousting an earlier, pagan bash. And, frankly, the entire occasion makes much more sense to me when I consider it as a product of Druid or Roman custom.</p> <p>When I was a child trying to get through Christmas - the time, you will recall, set aside especially for me and other nippers - the annual emotional assault course was little short of appalling. I spent my days dodging more or less psychotic family tiffs - presumably because this was also a time for the family. I tried, and failed, to avoid seasonal infections, endured endless sullen meals around an apparently never-decreasing avian corpse, and found myself alternately interrogated and given whisky-breathed kisses and damp coins by an unremitting stream of visitors. At any other week in the year, the social services would have been called out within minutes.</p> <p>Beyond swamping me with a precocious understanding of life's arbitrary brutality, Christmas made me feel both paranoid and put-upon. But if I had understood that it was bequeathed to me by religious cults who loved nothing better than burning people alive and collecting severed heads, everything would have seemed at least logical, although - obviously - no less malign.</p> <p>In my experience, Christmas has always been grisly but, unlike compulsory amputation or the crushing of a loved one by a rogue meteorite, it is a trial that demands constant, and preferably illuminated, displays of merriment. January may hobble in, hung over and slightly shame-faced, but it won't require party hats, an ounce of tinsel or the slightest attempt at bonhomie.</p> <p>It is a quiet, dark, properly restful month, full of calming occupations - getting pine needles out of carpets, throwing away or palming off ugly gifts, picking which minor amputation will get your weight down to November's level. And it includes that lovely, pointless tradition of promising to be a better, nicer, improved sort of person from now on, in the context of a rosily dimpled future. Naturally this convinces no one, not even you, but it is good to open the year with a gentle disappointment - all the others will be far more grotesque and, most likely, not of your own making.</p> <p>As a self-employed person, I have a particular fondness for January because it marks the point when everyone else gets their shoulders back to the grindstone and their noses to the wheel - or whatever it is salaried people do, I've never been quite clear, it seems to involve lots of tea breaks and dawdling. Every year, I struggle through December, trying to wheedle meaningful collaboration out of various people employed in various offices, and every year my hopes of getting anything useful done (or paid for) drop away as the days pass and seasonal depression, apathy, liver failure or festive chemical castration take their annual toll.</p> <p>Naturally, I beaver away between Christmas and New Year, secure in the deeply irritating knowledge that the majority of the population is either lolling in a semi-coma in front of Ice Station Zebra or creeping off to try to burn unwanted synthetic pullovers without succumbing to the resultant toxic smoke. In January, everyone who gets paid for being on holiday shuffles back to their desk and lets me get on with placating the Inland Revenue at the end of the month. And that, I have to say, is about as happy as I expect the new year to get.<br><b> AL Kennedy</b></p> <p>It is my 11th birthday, January 2 1982, and I am going to have a disco in the hall of the college where my dad teaches. During term-time, Dad runs discos for the foreign students, but tonight he's going to run one for me. He has proper flashing lights and a disco turntable, and it will be fab. This wouldn't be possible if my birthday were at any other time of year, but I am a January child. My birthday falls within the 12 days of Christmas when the college is shut.</p> <p>I have invited everyone in my class except for people I hate. All records by Adam and the Ants will be banned for the evening because I hate them. There will be a dancing competition. I'll win it because I'm going to dance to Tainted Love with Stephen Foster, the most gorgeous boy in the class. The prize is a rainbow pack of felt-tip pens. I will share them with Stephen and we will draw hearts on each other's wrists.</p> <p>The hall is all set up and Dad has assumed his place at the turntable. Mum is at the bar, pouring cherryade into paper cups. I am wearing my excellent new drainpipe jeans and legwarmers. Through the window, I can see the first people arriving, walking up the path with their parents.</p> <p>I love being a January child because my birthday comes at the start of a whole new year when everything is untried and exciting. The air is full of magic. This is the time of year for wishes and dreams.</p> <p>It's 9 o'clock, according to my birthday watch, and my disco is almost over. My little brother Rhidian just won the dancing competition - this result was rigged by Dad, who appointed himself judge without my consent.</p> <p>None of the boys would dance with the girls. In the middle of the room, Ben Wilkins and his gang are capering about to Stand and Deliver by Adam and the Ants. They are pretending to be \"dandy highwaymen\" and have drawn lines across their noses with felt-tips (Mum decided to break up the rainbow set and give everybody one each).</p> <p>Stephen Foster isn't here. I watched the door for ages until Mum asked me what on earth the matter was. When I told her, she went to the payphone to call Stephen's parents. Apparently his auntie and uncle came to visit for New Year and he had to stay at home.</p> <p>Having a January birthday is the pits.</p> <p>On January 5, I go back to school. I'd been dreading it but actually it's not so bad. Everyone is wearing new clothes and shoes, and they're all talking about how excellent my disco was. Stephen Foster is in love with Pippa Keene, but he's not so great, really. I think I just wanted someone to be King to my Disco Queen. I wouldn't admit it out loud but it's quite nice to be getting on with a bit of work again; getting on with the things in my life that are real.</p> <p>Nineteen Januarys have passed since my 11th birthday disco and now, in 2001, I'm about to hit 30. People have always commiserated with me about having a birthday on January 2. It's a terrible time for celebrations. Everyone's binged-out and spent-out or still away on their new year city-breaks and ski-trips or trying to keep dull dull dull resolutions about dieting, booze and fags.</p> <p>Being a January child means I'm cursed with the Capricorn star sign. I'm quick to say that astrology is guff but it niggles me that I'm classified as a \"slow but steady wins the race\" person; someone who likes a tidy house and is careful with money. Dull dull dull. But how could it possibly be any other way? This is January we're talking about.</p> <p>If January were a meal, it would be a particularly abrasive kind of muesli. If January were a film, it would be an educational documentary. If January were a colour, it would be magnolia. If January were a sport, it would be arm-wrestling.</p> <p>And yet we need January. We do. I thought my 11th birthday disco would make my wishes come true - but January is not a time of romance and wish fulfilment. It's a time for the bursting of bubbles, many of which need to be burst. If every month was like lazy, seductive August, we'd never get anything done. By the time flatulent December is blown out, we're glad of January with its Protestant work ethic; January, the chiselling month. The days are inching outwards again and that's not a bad thing. All the better for a Capricorn like me - a child of January - to get down to some chiselling. <br> <b> Anna Davis </b></p>",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, yesterday raised the threat of a rebound in world energy prices this year, when it backed moves for the oil exporters' cartel, Opec, to restrict production. The six nation Gulf Cooperation Council which includes the Saudis, yesterday called on Opec to authorise output cuts at its next meeting in mid-January. \"The GCC supreme council instructed their oil ministers to work to reduce production levels at Opec's next meeting and take any other measures to maintain equilibrium in the market and achieve the targeted price,\" the council's final communiqu\u00e9 said. The six Arab Gulf states control more than half of the world's oil reserves and their policies are crucial to global prices. Dealers have been watching Saudi Arabia closely as its position is seen as critical in securing agreement among the 11-member cartel. \"The oil market situation has been on everyone's mind during the summit's deliberations,\" one delegate said. Oil exporters are desperate to put a floor under crude prices which fell to a six month low of $25 a barrel in the run-up to Christmas. The more hawkish members of the cartel like Kuwait, Indonesia and Libya already favour quota restrictions to prevent a repeat of the price collapse two years ago, when world crude prices fell to below $10 a barrel. Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, last week called on the oil cartel to \"go to battle\" to defend the price of oil, while Indonesia said it would propose an output reduction of between one and 1.5m barrels per day at the next Opec meeting. Opec is now suffering from the success of its moves last year to quell rising world oil prices. The cartel, which controls two-thirds of global oil exports, jacked up production four times last year by a total of 3.7m barrels. After reaching a post-Gulf war high in October, prices have dropped by a nearly a third, bringing relief for hard pressed motorists throughout the west and reducing the chances of a sharp slowdown in the world economy this year. The resumption of Iraqi oil sales to Europe has also helped turn prices lower despite severe winter weather in both the US and continental Europe.

      "bodyText": "WH Smith is this week expected to announce it has abandoned controversial plans to set up its own national distribution system. The high street retailer sparked outrage after announcing it wanted to bypass local wholesalers and exclusively supply its own chain and leading supermarkets. However, it is understood to have now conceded defeat, after a series of meetings with industry associations, in return for a number of concessions. Senior executives at WH Smith and magazine industry representatives, including the Periodical Publishers Association, have been locked in talks over the past fortnight in an effort to hammer out a deal to end the dispute. A full press release, which could be put out tomorrow, is expected to give details of a new industry-wide distribution system. Weekend reports suggested these new plans would include centralised points of contact between retailers and wholesalers, as well as single invoicing, fewer deliveries and standardised wholesale systems implemented across Britain. Magazines and newspapers are at present distributed through a network of local wholesalers to shops across the country. It was feared the plan by WH Smith, although initially just relating to the supply of magazines, could be extended to newspapers as well. Research suggested up to 12,000 local newsagents would face the risk of closure if this was the case as they would be unable to bear any extra distribution costs. Industry sources say the agreement is a clear victory for Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, which said it would terminate its multi-million pound contract with WH Smith in protest at its plans. It is thought the six-month notice served on WH Smith by Associated will now be scrapped as a result of the successful talks. But it remains unclear how badly the reputation of WH Smith will be affected by the souring of relations over recent months. Some industry figures have been quoted as saying the retailer's actions had \"destroyed\" the goodwill built up over many years of trading and which may never be replaced. No one was available for comment at either Associated or WH Smith last night.",

Although it managed anaemic growth in 2000, end of year figures showed plunging industrial output, retail sales falling for the 44th straight month and unemployment at an eight-month high, suggesting that a descent back into full-blown recession cannot be ruled out. </p> <p>The Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, went on a walkabout in a shopping district in Tokyo last Wednesday, to highlight the continued weakness of personal consumption, which accounts for 60% of gross domestic product. </p> <p>He bought a pair of shoes for his forthcoming trip to Africa and a bag of carrots, but it will take much greater largess by consumers to establish a self-sustaining recovery. </p> <p>The global economy has done very nicely without much of a contribution from Japan over the past decade but that is only because the US has compensated by growing so strongly. If Japan goes into reverse at the same time as the US economy is slowing, everyone will feel the pinch. </p> <p>Of the three big industrialised economies, euroland seems to have the best prospects over the next year or so. Cyclically less advanced than the US, it has plenty of slack in the labour market and is slowly but steadily undertaking structural reforms which will make it more globally competitive. </p> <p>Not least of these reforms will be a major round of tax cuts in Germany, France and Italy which this year are expected to boost euroland GDP by 0.5% percentage point. </p> <p>While euroland will undoubtedly suffer from the slowdown in the US, it has none of the imbalances that plague the US economy and should for once outperform its transatlantic rival - assuming the European Central Bank is prepared to cut interest rates if necessary. </p> <p><strong> Rising stars</strong><br> </p> <p> However, the star performer of 2001 could well be the economies of the Middle East and north Africa. This year's slowdown in growth in the advanced economies owes much to last year's surge in the price of oil, which forced up producers' costs and reduced the purchasing power of consumers. </p> <p>But what caused protests on the streets of Europe lined the pockets of the governments of the big oil producing countries, which are now starting to spend again. The Economist Intelligence Unit says this will transform the economic outlook because such spending feeds through to the rest of the non-oil economy and helps to boost corporate profits. </p> <p>As a result, the EIU expects economic growth in the Middle East and north Africa to accelerate to 4.7% in 2001, making it the fastest growing region in the world. The fastest growing country is expected to be New Guinea, a one-off ranking due to rapid expansion of its oil sector. </p> <p>Another region which could surprise on the upside is Latin America, where, having finally shaken off the impact of the Asian financial crisis, Brazil is forecast to strengthen, acting as a locomotive for surrounding countries, although its pulling power will be offset by Mexico, which is likely to slow in line with its next door neighbour, the US. </p> <p>Overall 2001, looks like being a reasonably healthy one for the global economy. Although fears of recession in America could yet become a self-fulfilling prophecy, the odds are still on continued growth. </p> <p>Barring a hard landing in the US, global GDP is likely to expand by more than 3%. After growth of more than 4% last year, it will not feel very fast but it is likely to be more evenly distributed. Whether it will translate into a recovery of equity prices remains unclear. Assuming unchanged profit shares in GDP, steady growth normally means a bull not a bear market. </p> <p>But fierce global competition may well continue to keep the lid on price rises and keep profit margins tight, hence depressing share prices.

      "body": "<p>Equitable Life, the troubled insurance company, is under investigation by regulators amid claims it acted unfairly by doubling the penalties it imposes on those wishing to cash in their policies early. </p> <p>The office of fair trading last night confirmed it has launched an inquiry after being contacted by a disgruntled policyholder. </p> <p>Investigators have already written to senior executives at Equitable requesting a copy of its contract terms and given them a deadline of January 10 by which to respond. </p> <p>If the contract is found to be weighted in Equitable's favour the OFT can demand parts are amended or removed and can apply for a high court injunction if its requests are rejected. </p> <p>The inquiry centres on the fact the company raised the exit penalty from 5% to 10% after it was forced to shut for new business in December.

      "bodyText": "Equitable Life, the troubled insurance company, is under investigation by regulators amid claims it acted unfairly by doubling the penalties it imposes on those wishing to cash in their policies early. The office of fair trading last night confirmed it has launched an inquiry after being contacted by a disgruntled policyholder. Investigators have already written to senior executives at Equitable requesting a copy of its contract terms and given them a deadline of January 10 by which to respond. If the contract is found to be weighted in Equitable's favour the OFT can demand parts are amended or removed and can apply for a high court injunction if its requests are rejected. The inquiry centres on the fact the company raised the exit penalty from 5% to 10% after it was forced to shut for new business in December. The closure followed the collapse of takeover talks with Prudential amid fears of a \u00a35bn black hole in Equitable's finances. The increase in the exit penalty effectively locks in many of the company's policyholders. A spokesman for Equitable said the company would help with any inquiry and confirmed the level of the penalty has stood at 10% for just under a month with policyholders advised of the change by letter. The move, he said, was made to \"protect the fund for those policyholders that are staying in the fund\" as there was likely to be a \"level of uncertainty\" over the period. The complaint against Equitable has been brought under the \"unfair terms in consumer contracts\" legislation and will be examined by officials within a specialist unit of the OFT. It is likely to take some weeks to complete the inquiry as investigators plan to examine the entire contract to ensure it is not weighted against the consumer. \"We are giving this our priority as much as we can but we are dependent on getting information,\" said an OFT spokeswoman. \"We wrote to the company a couple of weeks ago and are talking to the financial services authority. If there is no response early in the new year we would approach them again. If a company continued to not respond then ultimately we could take them to court.\" The outcome of the inquiry could have grave consequences for the mutual which is already financially weak. Last July it was put up for sale after losing a landmark case over treatment of guaranteed annuity pension policies The FSA, criticised for allowing Equitable to carry on trading, is carrying out an internal review of its regulation of the company from January 1 1999 to December 8 2000. The review is expected to take some months to complete. According to separate weekend reports, the FSA fears people may get caught up in a fresh scandal with some independent advisers trying to persuade Equitable pension holders to switch their cash into expensive new schemes. It was also reported that dozens of MPs may lose money because part of their parliamentary pensions was invested in Equitable Life.
