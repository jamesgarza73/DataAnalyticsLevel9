She acquired a mythical lover, Phaon, for unrequited love of whom she was supposed to have made a fatal leap from the cliff of Leucadia. The papyrus rolls bearing her verses crumbled and were lost or found their way, literally, into the rubbish-heaps of history. And now, we don't even say her name properly, for though she has been called,variously, Sappho, Sapho, Saffo, Psappha, her name is, correctly, Psappho, and sounds rather startling to English ears when pronounced in the Greek - something like Ppppsappoppo. </p> <p>So Margaret Reynolds tells us in the introduction to her fascinating anthology of 2,500-years' worth of Sappho-inspired fiction, art and verse. And as the book also demonstrates, the confusion over Sappho's name is entirely appropriate. For the fragmentary nature of her oeuvre, her very absence from the historical record, has rendered Sappho susceptible to reconstruction and reappropriation by an astonishing range of cultural and literary fashions. </p> <p>The strength of Reynolds's anthology is its historical and cultural range. It begins with 30 of Sappho's own Fragments in Greek and translated forms, follows these up with early reworkings by Ovid and Catullus, and ends 400 pages later with a newly-minted poem, based on Fragment 96, by Ruth Padel. </p> <p>The history of changing representations of Sappho is really a number of histories, not least the history of sex and gender. Any Sapphic fiction-making involves acts of impersonation and ventriloquising, but male writers in particular have been keen to speak on Sappho's behalf, generating influential models which have also been silencing and punitive, anxiously heterosexualising or lubriciously indulgent. Ovid and Pope did much to fix Sappho in her suicidal pose. Baudelaire, Swinburne and Rops, on the other hand, co-opted her for decadence and pornography. </p> <p>Her reputation has had a tendency to decline as women have gained cultural and economic power; but while men have belittled her, female writers as diverse as Christine de Pisan, Madame de Sta\u00ebl and Olive Schreiner have made of her an icon of the persecuted female artist. She has been reborn for every era of feminism - as a bluestocking, a New Woman, a flapper.</p> <p>And, of course, as a lesbian. She has always figured as a kind of lesbian archetype - 'the first Tommy the world has upon record', as they quaintly put it in the 1780s. Just as her career works as a register of changing gender politics, so it illuminates the different phases of Western lesbian identity: Sappho the eighteenth-century Tommy becomes chic and \u00e9lite for Ren\u00e9e Vivien and Natalie Barney, and has been reconstructed more recently as a hippie swinger, a goddess-worshipper. </p> <p>Inevitably, the book is a crowded one, a busy and fragmented read. But fragments are what Sappho is all about, and the clutter of the book makes its own point about the reach and rapidity, the jostling for cultural space, of changing Sapphic fashions. </p> <p>Another, perhaps more serious, potential problem is that of bathos. It is a pleasure to be reminded of the spareness and sublimity of Sappho's own verse; few of the fictions inspired by it, however, are very memorable in their own right.

Paulin, who grew up in Belfast and appeared on BBC2's popular arts programme Late Review , is the only creative writer to have been nominated as a fellow in the first round of awards.

Yet while the intensity of this run of four books (the middle pair being American Pastoral and I Married a Communist) has been constant, their polarity is unpredictable. American Pastoral was very nearly as ferocious a defence of the American way of life as Sabbath's Theater had been an attack on it. </p> <p>The hero of The Human Stain is Coleman Silk, classics professor at Athena College, who resigns in disgust when charged with racism - he used the word 'spooks' to refer to two students who had never turned up for class, not knowing they were black and forgetting that the word had an insulting secondary meaning. Subsequently, he starts an affair with Faunia Farley, a functionally illiterate faculty janitor and part-time farmhand with a history of deprivation and suffering. She is 34 and he is 71. </p> <p>There is a scattering of Hawthorne references (Faunia's name presumably one), but this is more than a recasting of The Scarlet Letter, in emulation of Updike's Roger's Version. From the outside, the liaison seems exploitative to the very edge of abuse - what could he find in a woman like that to treat with respect? - when in fact 'their coupling is the drama into which they decant all the angry disappointment of their lives'. The relationship becomes public while another scandal is breaking in its own slow-motion fashion - the President and what he did or did not do with Monica Lewinsky. </p> <p>The national mood, as well as the local, is an 'ecstasy of sanctimony', though an obsession with purity is a perversion in its own right. At the high-water mark of Monicagate, the narrator dreams of a giant banner wrapped round the White House, in the manner of the artist Christo, bearing the message 'A Human Being Lives Here'. Was there any more to the scandal than that? </p> <p>The listing of the author's previous works breaks them down intriguingly into categories. Sabbath's Theater falls under the lowly heading 'other books', while The Human Stain and its two immediate predecessors qualify as 'Zuckerman books' by virtue of sharing a narrator (there are also 'Roth books' and 'Kepesh books'). Roth's output for a decade and more was preoccupied with alter egos and decoys, self-referential games that had rapidly diminishing returns for everyone, it seemed, but the author, frowning contentedly in his hall of mirrors. </p> <p>The reflexiveness of The Human Stain is more functional. Nathan Zuckerman, a novelist living reclusively, nevertheless befriends Coleman Silk and hears some of his confidences. Zuckerman is a usefully contrasting figure, having retired from the erotic arena even before a prostate operation interrupted his functioning, but for most of the book he recedes to a vanishing point. </p> <p>We forget, when Coleman regrets having fed 'that great opportunistic maw, a novelist's mind', that the self-reproaching thought is phrased by Zuckerman himself. The internal topology of the book is paradoxical and satisfying, like that mysterious, self-violating shape, the Klein bottle, an impossible object which challenges our ideas of inside and outside, surface and edge.</p> <p>Towards the end of the book, Zuckerman becomes more intrusive - we learn that he is writing a book about Coleman Silk called The Human Stain - and that he'll have to move away from the area, for his own safety, before it's published. One extended passage, from Faunia's point of view, and containing the title phrase ('Impurity, cruelty, abuse, error, excrement, semen - there's no other way to be here'), seems awkwardly interjected, for once, out of the preoccupations of narrator or author. </p> <p>Yet the great thrill of the book is Roth's ability to fill his creatures, up to their ears and beyond, with their own vitality. Faunia comes alive in a long passage about her love for crows, her brutal ex-husband in a 10-page scene in a Chinese restaurant, where he is being helped by a support group of fellow Vietnam War vets to get through a meal without killing the waiters. It's a sort of home-grown therapy. </p> <p>The initial situation of the book seems a little pat - the irresponsible accusation of racism inviting the conclusion that political correctness is the deeper problem. The patness turns out to be entirely deceptive and the book takes on the issue of race in America as seriously as a novel ever has. Still more impressive, because structurally unnecessary and thrown in for the sheer exhilaration of it, is a portrait of a French woman academic, career flirt and dispenser of all the right jargon, trying to draft a personal ad to appear in the New York Review of Books. Roth has learnt how to build up lovingly from inside what he despises in the abstract. </p> <p>In the years since Portnoy's Complaint, Roth's writing has explored a harsh, borderline, nihilistic notion of sex. His carnal philosophy is comfortless but cogent, seeing desire not as a search for wholeness but as the force that disrupts the artificial unity we make of our experience - 'the redeeming corruption that de-idealises the species and keeps us everlastingly mindful of the matter we are'. </p> <p>It's puzzling, then, that Roth or Zuckerman should be so surprised by the 'tyranny of propriety' and the prurient reaction to Monicagate. In the opening pages of the book, he comes close to moralising about moralising, preaching a sermon against sermons. If sex was simply recreation, then it would be grotesque for people to rail against it so much. But puritans actually agree with novelist or narrator in seeing it as an inherently transgressive drive. </p> <p>The Clinton references wouldn't be missed, if Roth had decided against them. But it's hardly a crushing criticism of this mighty novel to suggest that it connects more vitally with its other recurring reference point - Greek tragedy - than with the headlines of 1998. The dark sun of his gifts shines on.</p>",

Anyone confronting it can either resolve to do nothing else for several months and read it through or keep it indefinitely for dipping into, several pages at a time. Either would be worthwhile. </p> <p>The events of Kingsley Amis's life are no secret. He was a scholarship boy at City of London School and an exhibitioner at Oxford, where he joined the Communist Party and met Philip Larkin, his lifelong friend. He was an officer in Signals till the end of the war, then went back to Oxford ('the nice thing about Oxford is that its vessels of corruption are always being replenished').</p> <p>He married Hilly Bardwell when they decided an abortion was too risky, this being 1948, and later had two more children, including the novelist Martin. He got a job teaching English in what he calls Swonzy ('so handy for the National Scheissbedsodd'). </p> <p>After Lucky Jim appeared in 1954, his career took off; he won prizes, and eventually a fellowship at Peterhouse, Cambridge, which he gave up when he was able to live entirely from his writing. His stormy marriage to Hilly ended when, after heaven knows how many affairs on both sides, he fell in love with Elizabeth Jane Howard and married her in 1965. After Jane left him in 1980, Hilly moved back with her third husband to run the household, an unlikely arrangement that seemed to work well. Kingsley was knighted in 1990 and died in 1995, still brilliant, still insufferable, still drinking, by then an excessively right-wing, misogynistic, old curmudgeon. </p> <p>The best of the letters are the early ones to Larkin, when he is pouring out his rages and frustrations and views - endless views - about jazz and women and poetry and those who don't use English properly; about his detested father-in-law ('wearing a beret, looking like a French instituteur cashiered for offences against minors') and Wales ('Llgo andw ghet stwft, iu stwpydd olld swd'). These letters rollick along, adorned with rude drawings and often very funny spoofs of serious poems, spewing venom, lunacy and bawdiness in equal amounts. </p> <p>His denunciations, however unreasonable, are hypnotising. Since his hatreds included, apart from 'Pikarso', Chaucer, Milton, Dryden, Keats, Shelley, Beowulf ('I refer of course to the anonymous, crass, purblind, infantile featureless HEAP OF GANGRENED ELEPHANT SPUTUM, Barewolf'), Virginia Woolf, Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath, Waugh, Hugo, James and Dickens, it's a wonder that he managed to teach Eng Lit at all. </p> <p>Kingsley deplored Gerard Manley Hopkins for trying to write poetry as if it was a musical score, but he himself played the typewriter like a jazz piano, pounding, improvising, breaking into capitals, repeating phrases or abbreviations over and over for whole lines (bw for boogie woogie bw bw bw bw bw bw) using spellings to imitate speech ('Thank you for your mewst amewsing card'), fulminating after a typing error in a splutter of consonants; signing off with phrases like 'Kingsley hamfat', 'Kingsley ikonoklastes'. </p> <p>With Larkin, he seemed completely uninhibited; but they were less in touch during the Sixties, and though letters to Robert Conquest filled the gap to some extent, on the whole his letters become more decorous and duller, except when he was firing broadsides at newspapers - 'Not all standards have been fully lowered everywhere,' he wrote to The Observer, 'but your fashionable brand of sentimental mercy will hasten the process' - or writing lyrical love letters to Howard: 'I like women more than I did through being your lover.' </p> <p>Once success struck, he had dozens of other outlets for writing: novels, of course, articles, reviews, spoofs, poems, a thriller. He selected science fiction, wrote about wine and was briefly poetry editor of the Daily Mirror; he finished a James Bond after Ian Fleming's death. But the letters do have the strong flavour of their times and are always readable; they excellently chart his progress from angry young man and left-wing iconoclast to fulminating Garrick Club grandee. </p> <p>I didn't know Amis well, and nothing in the letters makes me wish I'd known him better, but I doubt if the publication of these letters will diminish his reputation as the publication of Philip Larkin's letters did his. Maybe, expecting something loftier from poets, we resent their grubbier aspects more; Kingsley's letters, though, reflect exactly the same personality as his books: irascible, brilliant, rude, moving and exceedingly funny. </p> <p>Zachary Leader not only gives us essential footnotes but follows up everything: he can't mention that a phrase is borrowed from a jazz record without explaining which band played it and when. The treatment does nudge one toward asking whether Amis, as a novelist, really rates this kind of exalted attention? </p> <p>In my view, he does. Kingsley Amis was that rarity, a man feted for being exactly on the pulse of his time - the Angry Young Man of the Fifties, casting a clear, disgusted eye on all that seemed most loved in British life - who, nevertheless, stayed the course as a novelist. </p> <p>But history will decide whether he deserves the Valhalla treatment. Doubtless, there will be an iconoclastic student in the year 3000 distorting cyberspace to denounce him. In the meantime, if you can lift it, enjoy this book.</p>",

With Larkin, he seemed completely uninhibited; but they were less in touch during the Sixties, and though letters to Robert Conquest filled the gap to some extent, on the whole his letters become more decorous and duller, except when he was firing broadsides at newspapers - 'Not all standards have been fully lowered everywhere,' he wrote to The Observer, 'but your fashionable brand of sentimental mercy will hasten the process' - or writing lyrical love letters to Howard: 'I like women more than I did through being your lover.' Once success struck, he had dozens of other outlets for writing: novels, of course, articles, reviews, spoofs, poems, a thriller. He selected science fiction, wrote about wine and was briefly poetry editor of the Daily Mirror; he finished a James Bond after Ian Fleming's death. But the letters do have the strong flavour of their times and are always readable; they excellently chart his progress from angry young man and left-wing iconoclast to fulminating Garrick Club grandee. I didn't know Amis well, and nothing in the letters makes me wish I'd known him better, but I doubt if the publication of these letters will diminish his reputation as the publication of Philip Larkin's letters did his. Maybe, expecting something loftier from poets, we resent their grubbier aspects more; Kingsley's letters, though, reflect exactly the same personality as his books: irascible, brilliant, rude, moving and exceedingly funny. Zachary Leader not only gives us essential footnotes but follows up everything: he can't mention that a phrase is borrowed from a jazz record without explaining which band played it and when. The treatment does nudge one toward asking whether Amis, as a novelist, really rates this kind of exalted attention? In my view, he does. Kingsley Amis was that rarity, a man feted for being exactly on the pulse of his time - the Angry Young Man of the Fifties, casting a clear, disgusted eye on all that seemed most loved in British life - who, nevertheless, stayed the course as a novelist. But history will decide whether he deserves the Valhalla treatment. Doubtless, there will be an iconoclastic student in the year 3000 distorting cyberspace to denounce him. In the meantime, if you can lift it, enjoy this book.",

      "body": "<p>Editing the letters of Kingsley Amis has been the single most enjoyable job of my life - but it has not been without difficulties. Within three days of Amis's death, his friend and biographer Eric Jacobs offered his unexpurgated diary of the novelist's last year or so to two Sunday newspapers. This diary included intimate details of Amis's final illness and debilitation as well as hurtful private remarks about close relations.</p> <p>The family was outraged, and though Jacobs agreed to withdraw the diaries from serialisation (only temporarily, as it turned out), he had lost its trust. As a consequence, he also lost the job of editing the letters, an appointment Amis himself had approved. Wounded, Jacobs rounded on Martin Amis, the family's spokesman, and later, after Martin announced that I was to take his place, on me. 'The curiously named Zachary Leader,' he wrote to one of Amis's correspondents, would be getting no help from him. </p> <p>Martin chose me because we were friends, he'd read my work (which partly discusses editorial procedures and principles), and we saw each other weekly, to play tennis; so the inevitable hassles I'd subject him to as a researcher - about dates, biographical details, identifications - could be woven into a weekly routine, after play. Martin himself was working on his memoirs (to be published, wholly fortuitously, within days of the letters), and, after a while, the post-tennis queries ran both ways. </p> <p>That we had each recently re-read his father's novels and poems meant we could also consult about elusive quotations and obscure literary allusions. It was a great way to work, especially since I was given free rein to print whatever letters I wanted (excepting a handful of letters containing wounding passages about relatives). Nothing Amis wrote about Martin himself was censored, nor, I should add, did anything in the letters ever shake Martin's confidence in his father's affection. </p> <p>I began immediately with the job of collection - less arduous in a selected correspondence than a complete one. Soon after I started, I was given Amis's last address book and wrote in search of letters to everyone listed in it. I also tried to contact all possible recipients mentioned in the Memoirs (1991), in Jacobs's biography (1995), and present at the memorial meeting for Amis held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 22 October 1996.</p> <p>A number of interesting letters, mostly to fans (Amis was scrupulous about answering fan mail), resulted from requests for correspondence, or information about correspondence, placed in British and American newspapers and literary periodicals. I also found important letters to fellow writers in over 20 university libraries and research institutes. </p> <p>Though laborious, the search was unanxious. From the start it was clear how rich the core of the book would be and where I would find it: in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, where Philip Larkin had deposited 531 previously unpublished Amis letters, and in Robert Conquest's garage in Palo Alto, California, where more than 100 letters were carefully stored in a cardboard box. Everything else I found - in public and private collections, the archives of publishers, editors, agents, critics, radio and television companies and newspapers - would be gravy. </p> <p>Choosing which letters to print, from a trawl of several thousand, was more difficult, though my criteria of selection were straightforward. When two letters made the same general points, observations, jokes, or transmitted the same news, I chose what I thought the stronger or livelier letter. My aim was to print letters from all periods of Amis's life and to a range of his correspondents. As well as letters to friends and fellow writers (including John Betjeman, Anthony Powell, Edith Sitwell, C.P. Snow, John Wain and others), I also included a number of business letters. From the time he resigned his Fellowship in English at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1963, Amis supported himself and his family as a novelist and freelance writer. The letters show how he did it. </p> <p>Amis's correspondence with women posed several problems. When Jacobs asked Amis who he thought might have letters, Amis replied 'women', adding immediately, in Jacobs's reconstruction (recorded in a note in the Huntington Library in California), 'that the trouble with that was that I might find some, then he would not want them published - for whatever reason - and then the women in question might be upset'.</p> <p>The only such letters I print were written to Amis's second wife, the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard. Hilly Amis (Lady Kilmarnock), his first wife, burned all his letters in 1963, the year their marriage collapsed. Though she does not remember how many there were, the figure must have been high. When they were separated for a month in October 1949 (Amis had just taken up a lectureship in English at Swansea), he wrote daily.</p> <p>The letters to Hilly that survive, those written after 1963, are mostly notes about money and arrangements for the children. They are chastened, considerate, affectionate, but in no way communicate the depth of his feelings for her over the years. After the break-up of his second marriage, Amis became clearer (or at least more public) about Hilly's importance to him: leaving her, he claimed, was the single biggest mistake of his life. In the fiction, the biographical writings, and the poetry, his feelings for her are carefully pondered; in the extant letters they figure only rarely, or in passing, though when they do appear the writing takes on a special intensity. </p> <p>Amis's feelings for Jane Howard, in contrast, are amply documented. As the letters she released to me show, he deeply loved her in the early years of their relationship. Gradually, however, as other letters reveal, he drew apart from her during their marriage, and he detested her after their break-up, with a ferocity as obvious in the correspondence as in the (related) misogyny of the later fiction. None of the letters I have seen to her are anything but warm and loving; but I have seen no letters from the period after she left him. </p> <p>As for Amis's supposed hatred of women, though much of what he writes about them in the correspondence will be deplored, his love letters are warm, tender, even abject in their expression of feeling. Nor was he always rude to, or bored with, women he didn't want to sleep with, even feminists. In 1987, the English academic Jan Montefiore wrote to Amis for permission to quote eight lines from his poem 'A Bookshop Idyll', which she criticises in her book Feminism and Poetry. Amis responded as follows: </p> <p>'Dear Miss Montefiore, </p> <p>I have written to Candida Lacey giving permission for the inclusion of 8 lines from my poem 'A Bookshop Idyll' in your forthcoming monograph. </p> <p>But please let me say that your interpretation of the poem is, I think, misguided. I really don't suggest (nor is it my opinion) that the love-poem is a quintessentially female mode; I was trying to make a more general point that women are less inhibited about expressing their feelings than men are, at any rate in our society. And though I'm pleased you think the poem good-natured, surely the people it patronises are not women but men, who cut a pretty sorry figure in the last verse [The last verse reads: 'Women are really much nicer than men, / No wonder we like them. / Deciding this, we can forget those times / We sat up half the night / Chockful of love, crammed with bright thoughts, names, rhymes, / And couldn't write']. </p> <p>All the same, I wish you the best of luck with your undertaking, and hope you are suitably enthusiastic about that great heroine of mine, Christina Rossetti. </p> <p>Yours sincerely, </p> <p>Kingsley Amis'</p> <p> Montefiore was amazed at the amiable tone of Amis's reply: 'As you can see he really couldn't have been nicer... and it's not as if I'd ever been introduced to him or to his son, or anything like that, so he wasn't doing me a personal favour, he was just being a decent liberal - unlike his agent who wanted to withhold permission because I'd been uncomplimentary.' </p> <p>Though I have found and print similarly generous and fair-minded letters, no one will be surprised to discover that the correspondence is littered with malicious, intemperate remarks about just about everybody Amis knew, Larkin and Hilly excepted. </p> <p>All I can say to those of Amis's friends and acquaintances who find themselves insulted or belittled in the letters is 'You're not alone'. Which is also what I'd say to maligned authors. That Amis admits to finding it hard to finish Martin's novels puts the son in good company; he also had trouble, the letters reveal, with Proust, Joyce, Lawrence, Updike, Bellow, and Nabokov. Towards the end of his life, he told Martin, the only books he could finish were thrillers, the sort that began 'A shot rang out' or 'A scream rent the air'. </p> <p>The most difficult of the problems I faced in choosing letters concerned the feelings of their recipients, as of others Amis disparages. Early in my work I was offered a sheaf of letters by an American academic who had written several books on Amis. These letters stretch over 17 years and are mostly warm and affectionate, though in later letters there are glimmers of irritation.</p> <p>Amis had taken this man to lunch, met his wife and son, had him to his house, introduced him to his friends, and written letters of reference for him. But he had also, I discovered, written a letter the man did not show me. A photocopy of this letter was found among Amis's papers after his death and offers a damning verdict on the first three chapters of the man's most recent work, a study of Amis's fiction. Here are its concluding paragraphs: </p> <p>'It is not that I find what you have written offensive in any way, or improper to its subject. It is that the level of your performance seems to me to be so low as not to earn a place on any publisher's list. </p> <p>Please realise that no imaginable rewriting would rectify the situation. The fact that I have left many passages of your typescript unmarked testifies to my weariness and boredom with them, not to their correctness or adequacy. </p> <p>I think it would be best if the book were to be withdrawn.</p> <p>Yours, Kingsley'</p> <p>I thought long and hard before publishing this letter - it was the single most difficult decision I faced in the selection process. In the end, though, I decided to include it, for several reasons: Amis's literary executors had already deposited the photocopy at the Huntington, so it was available to other scholars; it shows an important side of Amis - how ferocious he could be in his later years; it says something about his willingness to sacrifice personal feelings for what he seems to have seen as the welfare of his reputation as a writer; and not printing the letter would have left readers with a false or partial understanding of the relations between the two men. </p> <p>When informed of my decision the academic wrote that he understood, without being much pleased, adding that he remained baffled by Amis's sudden turn: 'It contradicts everything he communicated to me in person and in letters over the previous 17 years.' </p> <p>The business of annotating the letters, the third phase of my job as editor, could be fiendishly difficult, especially when dealing with letters to Larkin. These letters, the most brilliant in the book, are filled with private jokes, allusions, obscure abbreviations, associational leaps and word games.</p> <p>Most books, records, poems and songs, for example, are referred to by the first and last words in their titles, as in 'A Time' for A Dance to the Music of Time. Some are identified by the first letters, or first few letters, of their first and last words, as in 'GB' for 'Goodbye to Berlin,' or 'Appara' (an editor's nightmare this) for 'Appointment in Samarra.' Often the letters proceed associationally: 'I love the persistent mis-spelling of authors' names,' declares Amis in a letter of 25 May 1947, 'it's amazing how it lowers the tome wainsh the tone. Talking of Wainsh [ie John Wain]...' </p> <p>Misspellings are of several sorts. Some derive from typos (all of which have been retained, even when most obvious), as in 'tome' for 'tone,' 'teh' for 'the,' or 'thiknign' for 'thinking' (which to Amis 'sounds really extraordinary - a character in Ibsen? Pastor Thiknign?'); others are laboriously crafted, as in 'methsleeves' for 'themselves,' or 'darts B.A.' for 'bastards.' Then there are phonetic spellings, often parodies of the sort of prim, suburban pronunciation mocked in the fiction: 'ab8' for 'about', 'hay' for 'how', 'refained' for 'refined', as in Chapter 4 of Lucky Jim, where Margaret comments of Christine after their first meeting: 'Pity she's so refained, though.' </p> <p>Often I could only make sense of puzzling passages by reading the letters to which they responded. In this way I learned, for example, the identity of 'Bluebell' (Robert Conquest's dog) or 'engine driver Hunt', from a passage in a letter reading 'Praed, Hood, Gilbert - and engine driver Hunt' (Hunt turns out to be a subject, not an author, of light verse, from the pseudonymous Conquest limerick beginning 'A young engine driver called Hunt'), or the meanings of the abbreviations PWR, IWICSLMSK and BHQ (respectively, Pee-Wee Russell, 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' and 'Bastard Headquarters', meaning God's Heaven, or, more generally, the place where things go wrong or get fucked up, said in one letter to be located in France). </p> <p>The most fiendish of the puzzles I encountered in the correspondence occurs in a letter to Larkin of 22 March 1982. Amis had broken his leg ('standing up, trying to avoid an alcoholic fall') and was recuperating in the Kinnell Ward of the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead: </p> <p>'There's an old woman here who sings all day. Wordless maunderings based on Camptown Races... Yes, all day. She's French, actually. Do you remember about Kinnell or Kinell? Used to be (milite) the more proper of a pair, the other being Kinarsoles.' </p> <p>It was Denis Norden, an exact contemporary of Amis's at the City of London School, who explained to me the meaning of this passage. 'Milite' (Latin) I could get myself; in this context it means 'in military parlance'. 'Kinnell' or 'Kinell', Norden explained, are short for 'Fuckin'ell,' to go with 'Fuckin'arsoles.' Of the pair, then, 'Kinnell' is 'the more proper'. Presto! The critic P.N. Furbank then supplied a related marching song, one line of which runs 'Arsehole, arsole, a soldier of the King'. Such are the intricacies of scholarship. </p> <p>One passage defeated me. In a letter of 27 August 1950 Amis calls Larkin 'my inner audience', my watcher in Spanish, the reader over my shoulder.' 'Inner audience' is clear enough and 'reader over my shoulder' comes from Robert Graves, but what is a 'watcher in Spanish'? Spanish has no equivalent of 'inner audience' or 'reader over my shoulder' involving the word 'watcher' (or spectator, observer, onlooker). No such term appears in the dictionaries of quotation or in Amis's B.Litt thesis (with its discussion of the role of the 'inner audience' in poetic composition). </p> <p>The lexicographer Jonathan Green suggested that 'watcher in Spanish' might be a slang term, like 'Spanish archer' for 'elbow' (i.e. El Bow), or 'the King of Spain's trumpet' for 'Donkey' ('Don Key'). Another friend suggested 'Guardian Angel' (a 'watcher' of sorts with a Spanish name, 'Angel'). The first person to come up with a definitive answer gets a free copy. </p> <p>All that remains for me now is to wait for the critics, a long-imagined purgatory. I gather Eric Jacobs has been commissioned to review the book for the Times.</p>",

In this way I learned, for example, the identity of 'Bluebell' (Robert Conquest's dog) or 'engine driver Hunt', from a passage in a letter reading 'Praed, Hood, Gilbert - and engine driver Hunt' (Hunt turns out to be a subject, not an author, of light verse, from the pseudonymous Conquest limerick beginning 'A young engine driver called Hunt'), or the meanings of the abbreviations PWR, IWICSLMSK and BHQ (respectively, Pee-Wee Russell, 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' and 'Bastard Headquarters', meaning God's Heaven, or, more generally, the place where things go wrong or get fucked up, said in one letter to be located in France). The most fiendish of the puzzles I encountered in the correspondence occurs in a letter to Larkin of 22 March 1982. Amis had broken his leg ('standing up, trying to avoid an alcoholic fall') and was recuperating in the Kinnell Ward of the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead: 'There's an old woman here who sings all day. Wordless maunderings based on Camptown Races... Yes, all day. She's French, actually. Do you remember about Kinnell or Kinell? Used to be (milite) the more proper of a pair, the other being Kinarsoles.' It was Denis Norden, an exact contemporary of Amis's at the City of London School, who explained to me the meaning of this passage. 'Milite' (Latin) I could get myself; in this context it means 'in military parlance'. 'Kinnell' or 'Kinell', Norden explained, are short for 'Fuckin'ell,' to go with 'Fuckin'arsoles.' Of the pair, then, 'Kinnell' is 'the more proper'. Presto! The critic P.N. Furbank then supplied a related marching song, one line of which runs 'Arsehole, arsole, a soldier of the King'. Such are the intricacies of scholarship. One passage defeated me. In a letter of 27 August 1950 Amis calls Larkin 'my inner audience', my watcher in Spanish, the reader over my shoulder.' 'Inner audience' is clear enough and 'reader over my shoulder' comes from Robert Graves, but what is a 'watcher in Spanish'? Spanish has no equivalent of 'inner audience' or 'reader over my shoulder' involving the word 'watcher' (or spectator, observer, onlooker). No such term appears in the dictionaries of quotation or in Amis's B.Litt thesis (with its discussion of the role of the 'inner audience' in poetic composition). The lexicographer Jonathan Green suggested that 'watcher in Spanish' might be a slang term, like 'Spanish archer' for 'elbow' (i.e. El Bow), or 'the King of Spain's trumpet' for 'Donkey' ('Don Key'). Another friend suggested 'Guardian Angel' (a 'watcher' of sorts with a Spanish name, 'Angel'). The first person to come up with a definitive answer gets a free copy. All that remains for me now is to wait for the critics, a long-imagined purgatory. I gather Eric Jacobs has been commissioned to review the book for the Times.",

Here was a character custom-made for a mystery series, a big man with a violent temper and 'rock-breaking hands' who had served 27 years in an Indiana prison for murdering a man and a woman in a drunken fury and was now eking out a living in the black enclave of Watts. </p> <p>But his usual response to the situations in which he found himself was not to use his fists but his philosopher namesake's Socratic method. Instead of hardboiled guns and gore, Mosley was offering morality tales, in which Fortlow was constantly asking: 'What is the right thing to do here?' </p> <p>Mosley was open about his didactic intent. He stated his hope that young, inner-city people would read the stories in a school or workshop, relate them to their own lives and in that way 'see some kind of importance in literature'. </p> <p><strong> Walkin' the Dog</strong> is the second collection of linked stories. It's some years since Fortlow's release from prison, and at the start of the collection he is still making his home in a two-room shack in an alley between two derelict buildings. But now he has a girlfriend, a job and a two-legged dog called Killer. He also has the police on his back. These responsibilities make doing the right thing even more difficult. </p> <p>Each story teases out the moral implications of sometimes quite minor actions. So, for example, in 'Blue Lightning', Fortlow is offered a better-paying job but has to consider whether the extra pay is worth the freedom he would have to give up. In 'Promise', he has to balance keeping a vow made long ago to a dying friend with the consequences of that action. </p> <p>Outlining the stories makes them sound trite or dull. They're neither. Nor are they worthy, a kind of consolations of philosophy for the inner-urban citizen. Sure, Fortlow is trying to find meaning in his own life and the lives of those around him but these are tough, realistic tales of suffering and hardship. Fortlow is no Dudley Do-Right; violence is always a lurking possibility and he has killed again since leaving prison. Walkin' the Dog is an absorbing, thoughtful read, so beautifully constructed and written that you never doubt for a moment these are real people in real situations. </p> <p>Peter Robinson's novels are squarely within the conventions of mystery writing, even down to the characteristics expected of the cop in the British police procedural. His Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks is a music-loving, poetry-reading man at odds with his boss; his family life is in turmoil and he's trying to cut down on the booze and fags. So far so familiar. </p> <p>But what raises Robinson's series out of the routine is the thoughtfulness of the writing, the subtlety of the characterisation and the skill of the plotting. <strong> In a Dry Season</strong>, his tenth - and best - novel featuring Banks, demonstrates these qualities in abundance. Given that the main theme of the book is about uncovering the past, it has a wonderful central image, an abandoned village revealed at the bottom of a dried-up reservoir in Yorkshire. </p> <p>When a boy finds a skeleton there, Banks is brought in by his antagonistic boss, Chief Constable 'Jimmy' Riddle, to head what looks like being a dull, routine investigation but quickly turns into a murder hunt. The course of Banks's investigation and his growing relationship with his colleague DS Annie Cabbot is one of two intertwined narratives in the novel. </p> <p>A former resident of the village writes a first-person account of the events between 1941 and 1945 leading up to the murder. Robinson's storytelling gifts are at their best as he conjures up that era of rationing, Land Girls, jitterbugging and the tensions aroused when glamorous American airmen swept the local girls off their feet and into their beds. The result is a page-turning and complex mystery. Although the climax is overly melodramatic, In a Dry Season is a terrific work, deservedly on this year's short list for the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar for best novel of the year. </p> <p>Peter Lovesey has won many awards around the world in a 30-year writing career. On Friday, he entered the British crime-writing hall of fame when he was awarded the prestigious Crime Writer's Association/Cartier Diamond Dagger for his contribution to mystery writing - 21 novels and three collections of short stories. </p> <p>His twenty-second novel, <strong> The Reaper</strong>, an entertaining black comedy set in a traditional English village, is as bright and breezy as his first, Wobble to Death. The Reaper relates the exploits of Otis Joy, the handsome, charming but murderous vicar of the parish. So that he can keep his living, people are dying.

Next, Yu-ying cuts May's toenails and then binds her four toes down against the heel of her foot.</p> <p>'A bound foot is not,' the narrator informs us in a chilling tone, 'a foot whose growth has been arrested. A bound foot is a foot broken: a foot folded in the middle, toes forced down toward the heel.' May is surprised when her grandmother hurts her, but she is a good girl and does what she's told. But when Yu-ying forces her to walk on her bound feet, May refuses. Yu-ying responds by shaming and then abandoning her. Alone, needing her mother, May hobbles to find her, tears silently streaming down her face. </p> <p>Harrison's somewhat sensationalist depiction of binding feels less authentic than Jung Chang's in Wild Swans. What saves her text is the way she develops May's bound feet into the key structuring metaphor of the novel. Thus, May's bound feet not only explain aspects of her character, they also connect disparate sections of narrative. </p> <p>Foot binding is contextualised by a moral framework and the following themes: the price of beauty and the darker side of matriarchy. By binding her feet, Yu-ying believes she is ensuring May's future (they will increase her chances of finding a rich husband). On the other hand, in Harrison's version, the custom is barbaric, little more than a nineteenth-century crime. </p> <p>Yet Harrison's moralistic perspective stops short of outright condemnation. On the contrary, the practice is presented in an ambiguous light: bound feet can also be beautiful, even erotic. She suggests a parallel between traditional Chinese culture and the Western obsession with plastic surgery. </p> <p>Subsequent horrible husband abandoned, May then marries Arthur, a Jewish-Australian expatriate, but this marriage fails, too. Nevertheless, it is through Arthur that May first comes to know Alice, his niece, the other main character in the novel. Deprived of her mother's love (Alice's sister Cecily is the favourite), May fills an emotional hole in Alice's life and for May, Alice is the daughter she never had. The two develop a close bond. </p> <p>On the plus side, May encourages Alice to think for herself and to express herself freely in her rebellion against her family and, in all fairness, Alice is a willing convert to May's cynicism and sophistication. But on the minus side, the relationship between the two women becomes destructive when May, widely overstepping her role as an aunt, entices Alice to promise she is 'hers', that is, her daughter, belonging to May, not to Alice's biological mother. From this moment on, Alice devotes her attention to her needy aunt, further distancing herself from her biological family. The cycle begun by May's grandmother is almost complete. </p> <p> The Binding Chair's narrator cuts between May and Alice's points of view, beginning with the present tense in the South of France, and going back to the hodge-podge past in Shanghai. While this allows Harrison to suggest parallels between the two women's lives, the introduction of additional points of view towards the middle slows the action. </p> <p>Ultimately, it's Harrison's mesmeric voice which compels the reader towards the inevitable climax.

Ceuta, the Spanish enclave on the Moroccan coast, is a little EU outpost. Now it has becomes a little EU fortress, for if you can get in there, the free-travelling way into mainland Spain and from there on to France and Germany lies open before you. </p> <p>So now, with Brussels paying, Ceuta has barricaded itself behind a double-exclusion fence backed with rolls of razor wire, electronic sensors and closed-circuit television. And yet, as Jeremy Harding found when he went to Ceuta, people still hurl themselves at this fence. They set out from West Africa on a journey - walking across the Sahara, hitching lifts on trucks, guided and fleeced by the traffickers of Niger, Algeria and Morocco - which may last months. </p> <p>Some in each group die on the way, mostly of disease and thirst. They bring a few women with them, bodies to be used as rape currency to get past frontier patrols. And when they get to Ceuta, they hide themselves in the sand, wait their moment and then rush at the wire. And some, 'slashing their legs to shreds', do get over it. Inside 'Europe', they join the 'Great Uninvited', those the Dover Express defines as 'human sewage'. But at least they have made it. </p> <p>Marvellous, sharp-end reportage is a big part of this book. But what makes Jeremy Harding's writing so compelling is the way he interprets what he sees and hears. From Ceuta, he points out that the sheer horror of these immense desert pilgrimages fulfils, accidentally, a European requirement. It sieves out the applicants. Only the most able survive. 'These job-seekers,' says Harding drily, 'are among the most highly motivated in Europe.' </p> <p>In the same way, he goes down to the Puglian coast of Italy to watch the patrol boats chasing the gommoni - the rubber dories which rush illegal migrants across the Adriatic from the Albanian shore - and finds that the traffickers can be brave and unselfish with their passengers as well as extortionate. </p> <p>'I became suspicious of the ideas that the traffickers were the modern embodiment of evil.' They are crooks, often attached to mafias, but nobody else would do what they are doing - helping the helpless. Harding thinks of the bar in Casablanca and that fawning Peter Lorre figure.

      "bodyText": "The Uninvited: Refugees at the Rich Man's Gate Jeremy Harding Profile \u00a35.99, pp128 Few people know that the European Union extends into Africa. Ceuta, the Spanish enclave on the Moroccan coast, is a little EU outpost. Now it has becomes a little EU fortress, for if you can get in there, the free-travelling way into mainland Spain and from there on to France and Germany lies open before you. So now, with Brussels paying, Ceuta has barricaded itself behind a double-exclusion fence backed with rolls of razor wire, electronic sensors and closed-circuit television. And yet, as Jeremy Harding found when he went to Ceuta, people still hurl themselves at this fence. They set out from West Africa on a journey - walking across the Sahara, hitching lifts on trucks, guided and fleeced by the traffickers of Niger, Algeria and Morocco - which may last months. Some in each group die on the way, mostly of disease and thirst. They bring a few women with them, bodies to be used as rape currency to get past frontier patrols. And when they get to Ceuta, they hide themselves in the sand, wait their moment and then rush at the wire. And some, 'slashing their legs to shreds', do get over it. Inside 'Europe', they join the 'Great Uninvited', those the Dover Express defines as 'human sewage'. But at least they have made it. Marvellous, sharp-end reportage is a big part of this book. But what makes Jeremy Harding's writing so compelling is the way he interprets what he sees and hears. From Ceuta, he points out that the sheer horror of these immense desert pilgrimages fulfils, accidentally, a European requirement. It sieves out the applicants. Only the most able survive. 'These job-seekers,' says Harding drily, 'are among the most highly motivated in Europe.' In the same way, he goes down to the Puglian coast of Italy to watch the patrol boats chasing the gommoni - the rubber dories which rush illegal migrants across the Adriatic from the Albanian shore - and finds that the traffickers can be brave and unselfish with their passengers as well as extortionate. 'I became suspicious of the ideas that the traffickers were the modern embodiment of evil.' They are crooks, often attached to mafias, but nobody else would do what they are doing - helping the helpless. Harding thinks of the bar in Casablanca and that fawning Peter Lorre figure. 'You despise me, don't you? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them.' And up the coast at the Regina Pacis refuge camp, he meets a defiant priest who proclaims that the illegals have only two friends in the world: his refuge and organised crime. Harding traces the history of what he calls 'Europe's project of exclusion', the slow slinking-away from commitment to the 1951 Convention on refugee status towards a new dream of 'Fortress Europe', which he bitingly calls a 'dreary pastoral fantasy, in which the European Union resembles an Alpine valley surrounded by impregnable, snow-capped mountains'. It is now almost incredible to recall the way in which France, for example, simply opened its frontiers between the world wars to hundreds of thousands of White Russians, Armenians fleeing genocide, German anti-Nazis and Jews, Spanish Republicans or Italian opponents of Mussolini. There were 8,000 Russians working in Renault at Billancourt alone and by 1939 six per cent of the population were of foreign origin. Britain was generous too, once.

It is a fine ideal to answer migrant pressure by transferring resources to the territories they come from, but it is not likely to work.

The evidence is quite to the contrary - that a rise in GDP leads to a rise in emigration. For years, Mexico showed a combination of rapid growth and soaring emigration, legal or illegal. Sub-Saharan Africa, on the other hand, has so far sent only about four million emigrants out of the continent, and the greatest number of African wanderers and displaced families move only short distances to a neighbouring country. Unfortunately, by trying to enrich the poor countries, the rich countries exacerbate the problem rather than solve it - even if the transfer of resources is good and inevitable for a host of other reasons. The first key to understanding migration is understanding that the distinction between 'genuine asylum-seeker' (good) and 'economic migrant' (bad) is rubbish.

The republicans said arms dumps could be inspected at regular intervals by agreed representatives of an international decommissioning body to prove that weapons were not being used. A statement by the group, whose previous refusal to begin disarmament led to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive, said that 'in the context of the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement', the IRA was willing to put its arms 'completely and verifiably beyond use'. The weapons would be dumped in 'such a way as to avoid risks to the public or misappropriation by others' - an apparent reference to dissident hardline republicans such as the Real IRA. The noon announcement came after Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, put forward new proposals that they said could allow a restoration of the suspended Assembly and a return to devolved rule for the six counties.

In fact, the IRA statement goes further than Trimble's UUP could have hoped for, by agreeing to let a third party inspect their arms dumps. However, Unionists have pointed out that the IRA is still only referring to a 'cessation' of violence and has not yet renounced violence.The organisation's credibility has also been damaged by continuing punishment beatings on the streets of Northern Ireland cities. The final act preceding this huge change seems to have been a meeting that took place within the past four weeks in Dublin between senior members of the Irish government and the IRA itself.

The flagship steel plant at Llanwern in South Wales, which employs 3,000 people, is threatened with imminent closure, while the future of a strip mill at Port Talbot, which employs 3,200 people, is also thought to be in jeopardy. The steelmaker Corus, which owns the plants, warned Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers last week that they may be forced to shut Llanwern. Sir Ken Jackson, head of the Amalgamated Electrical and Engineering Union, told The Observer : 'Llanwern is on the brink. There is a very real threat of it closing.' In a series of crisis talks last week, the unions and Corus told Byers of the devastating impact that the strong pound and the meltdown of the British car industry was having on UK steel manufacturing. Rover and Ford account for 400,000 tonnes a year of Corus's strip steel, which comes from UK plants. This week Ford is also expected to announce another devastating blow to the British car industry with the end of car production at its Dagenham, Essex, factory. Jackson warned Byers: 'The fallout from Rover has been underestimated, and the strength of the pound is causing Corus to haemorrhage profits.'",

Just like a tenacious, little, marshmallow turd stuck to the sole of a trainer, Sinead was the 'friend' who nobody in the gang had quite managed to shake off, so she'll probably die in episode six. </p> <p> Anyway, she was in love, neatly, with another redhead, Mark (the estimable Damian Lewis, late of the excellent Warriors), but he was oblivious to Sinead's feelings, having long been involved in a bit of inter-follicular miscegenation with a raven-haired beauty. Meanwhile, his intended, Emma, the mother of his son, was a bored and slightly tortured sensitivesomething played by Dervla Kirwan, who is almost as famous for her love life as she is for her acting. </p> <p> However, Emma wasn't too keen on the idea of marrying Mark because she wanted to sleep with his brother, Richard, the blond butcher, (Hugo Full Monty Speer), who was involved with a (blond) hairdresser called Louise, (Amanda Holden). In real life, Holden is married to Les Family Fortunes Dennis and, over Easter, both could be seen in Happy Birthday Shakespeare, during which Holden had an affair with Neil Morrissey, whose character was married to Dervla Kirwan. </p> <p> Anyway, if you still can't quite place Amanda, she is to be found on the cover of the current Radio Times (Dervla was on it last week) among a bunch of other shiny, young sorts in parochial version of the Vanity Fair 'new talent' covers. </p> <p> But I digress. Emma doesn't want much out of life - just some wildly inventive sex with Richard, with whom she's convinced herself she's in love. But is Richard suddenly going to get promoted to head of the sausage department, keep her in cow pies till the pigs come home? I don't think so. Anyway, Mark is a teacher, probably with prospects. </p> <p> The night before Emma marries Mark, she gets off with a colleague during one of those warm Asti Spumante, strip-lighting and novelty-balloon fests we recognise as the office party. So the next day, while Sinead reads a Native American poem ('You have made a building out of heart and bone...') at the register office and everybody sniggers, Emma plights her troth to Mark, wearing a livid-looking lovebite concealed under a scarf. Mark spots it later, though during the pub lunch-cum-reception, and just before the credits rolled, you could see that his world was about to implode quite redly. </p> <p> So far, Hearts and Bones is everything that<strong> Metropolis</strong> isn't: well-written, empathetically acted, not too scarily hip, plausibly plotted, directed with intimacy and intelligence and boasting real red-headed actors playing genuine red-headed characters. In fact, despite the fact that you couldn't really care less about any of the characters, H&amp;B is the model of a post-This Life sensitivesomething drama. </p> <p> Metropolis, on the other hand, is quite an extraordinary piece of garbage. After watching the first two episodes, I thought I'd better make sure that this really was as bad as it appeared to be by watching the remaining six in one sitting. </p> <p> By the end, I was nostalgic for the beginning, when things had merely looked crass and heavy-handed in an amusing sort of way, rather than exasperatingly, enragingly, depressingly and expensively crass and heavy-handed. Metropolis was written by Peter Morgan, who was responsible for the charmless romantic comedy Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Lawrence. Morgan had obviously used up too many first names in one go, so in the sparklingly-titled Metropolis, he reprises a Frank, this time giving it to his (dyed but meant to be real) red-headed character, an insurance- claims inspector whose pudding-basin hairdo starts off bright copper before a brief phase of dirty blondness, ending up gleaming and burnished again, like a Burne-Jones babe. But, frankly, tonsorial continuity was the least of Frank's problems - somewhere behind being completely and utterly redundant plotwise. But then he's not alone in that. </p> <p> As in Hearts and Bones, Metropolis revolves around the lives of six former college friends muddling along together, preparing to knock loudly on the door of 30 shouting: 'Let me in, I'm a grown-up', but wondering quite why they've bothered staying friends. Apparently - and here's the science bit - six is the perfect number of characters for an ensemble comedy drama-cum-thriller-thing: enough to cover the bases vis-\u00e0-vis beauty, brains and losers, but not so many that you forget their names or who's sleeping with whom. Unless it's Friends, of course, where no losers are ever allowed, so help them God. In Britain, however, everybody can be both a loser and loathsome. Though to be a loser and loathsome and clich\u00e9d and unfunny as well is, I think, almost unforgivable. And to squander a bunch of young actors with everything professionally still to live for is clearly downright wicked. </p> <p> There is a stalker character in Metropolis who is played so badly by James Purefoy that he should be grateful he has three distracting movies currently awaiting release. Portraying all-purpose psychosis, Purefoy adopts a terrifying, high-pitched, wheedling and eye-rolling routine which makes him look and as though he were auditioning to play Tinky Winky. And then there's Flora Montgomery as a Tory sleazebitchlet on the make, who is clearly very comfortable with non-gratuitous semi-nudity. Or, come to that, totally gratuitous semi-nudity. Unfortunately, even while wearing Agent Provocateur underwear, she smoulders like the young Princess Anne preparing to take a particularly exhilarating jump at Badminton. </p> <p> Then there is James Fox who, very tragically - and at the age of, what? fifty- or sixtysomething? - is finally revealed to have been earning his living as an actor under completely false pretences for all these years. Wooden? The man arrived on set with instructions for self-assembly. Still, given that Fox's character is a billionaire, patrician financier called, er, Milton Friedkin, who lives in a hotel and owns all the gold in the world you can't really blame him. 'Arrr-harrr!' Milton tells his young lover at one point later in the series. 'Read the signs and everything falls into place.' This is advice the whole cast might have been advised to take to heart and bone. </p> <p> Still, I think I may have to return to Metropolis in the next few weeks because I haven't yet had the opportunity to write about Gina Bellman, who this week crops up as an Armenian widow and seduces Frank. In the meantime, however, you can see the beautiful Ms Bellman on the front cover of Radio Times, right there alongside Hearts and Bones 's Amanda Holden and another of Metropolis 's feckless yoofs, Matthew Rhys. And Krishnan Guru-Murthy who, by some extraordinary oversight, has totally failed to land himself a part in a sensitivesomething comedy drama thriller series. Yet. Anyway, this week sees the start of yet another new sensitivesomething comedy drama series, on BBC 2. This one is called Coupling and, rather confusingly, stars Gina Bellman.

Anyway, I'm in a slightly less sour mood this week, so I freely admit to a titter when Ali told Anita Roddick that 'me clothes are made out of an animal called a Crylic. It lives in Taiwan. Over 20 Crylics were used to make the pants'. And a howl, no less, when, on the brink of death, Ali found himself briefly in Heaven, in front of Jah. 'While I'm up here, I couldn't get another couple of inches?' he wondered. But Jah told it like it is: 'No, 11 is enough for any man.' Amen to that.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Spring has sprung, and butterflies are on the wing. And if one US scientist is correct, one of the most pleasing sights of early summer - brilliantly coloured insects fluttering from flower to flower - is thanks to an unexpected creature: the bat. According to biologist Jayne Yack, bats spurred the evolution of modern-day butterflies by forcing them into the daylight hours to avoid being eaten. 'The general feeling is that butterflies as we know them were once more moth-like, and at some point they moved into the day,' she says. Yack, a behavioural biologist at Carleton University in Ottawa, began working on this theory when she discovered a pair of ears located on the wings of a small nocturnal tropical butterfly, a Macrosoma heliconiaria, on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. Yack used a hand-held device to emit sound at frequencies of around 25,000 vibrations per second, well beyond the range of human hearing, but sufficient to send the butterflies swooping.

Ultrasonic hearing isn't unusual in the nocturnal insect world - praying mantises, grasshoppers and certain scarab beetles display the trait - but Yack's discovery marks the first time that such ears have been identified in butterflies. Macrosoma butterflies are members of a class of butterflies called Hedylids, which are believed to be a 'living ancestor of modern butterflies', say Yack and a zoologist, Professor James Fullard, of Toronto University at Mississauga, writing in Nature. Like many moths, they have ears sensitive to the squeaks emitted by bats which allows them to pinpoint these predators before being eaten by them. However, this complex defence was later supplanted by an easier protection, one now adopted by all other butterflies outside this small tropical group of insect: they became day-flying creatures.

      "body": "<p>Men are the real moaners about their health. By contrast, women are much more stoical about their ailments.</p> <p>Women have known this for a long time, of course, but now female certainty about the weakness of the male of the species has been supported by scientists. British researchers have found that men are more likely to exaggerate their medical woes, while women underplay them. More worryingly, these researchers say there is a widespread failure among doctors to appreciate this.</p> <p>As a result, women are often denied proper health care for quite serious conditions - even heart disease - while men are given preferential treatment when they complain of these illnesses.</p> <p>'It is widely assumed women are more ready than men to report illness and to seek help,' said Professor Sally Macintyre, of the Medical Research Council (MRC) social and public health sciences unit, in Glasgow.</p> <p>'Men - by contrast - are thought to be reluctant visitors to surgeries. So when they do go, their complaints are somehow presumed to have a more serious content.'</p> <p>Yet no study has conclusively supported this idea, she said, despite it being entrenched in the minds of medical practitioners. Recent work by her unit, and other groups, has found that it is men who are more likely to complain to doctors about illnesses, while women are more medically reserved.</p> <p>One analysis carried out by Macintyre, using data collated by researchers at the MRC common cold unit, found that men were significantly more likely to 'over-rate' their sniffles, sore throats, headaches, and shivers compared with ratings given by clinical observers. By contrast, women under-rated their symptoms.</p> <p>Similarly, a US study of men and women affected by osteoarthritis found that men were significantly more likely than women to report pain, whether or not they were undergoing treatment.</p> <p>In a recent study of men and women in Scotland, it was found that men were almost twice as likely as females to say they suffered from long-term medical conditions in response to questions about illness in the most recent national census.</p> <p>Other studies have been less conclusive and have merely found there is no difference between the sexes in their attitudes to illness.

      "bodyText": "Men are the real moaners about their health. By contrast, women are much more stoical about their ailments. Women have known this for a long time, of course, but now female certainty about the weakness of the male of the species has been supported by scientists. British researchers have found that men are more likely to exaggerate their medical woes, while women underplay them. More worryingly, these researchers say there is a widespread failure among doctors to appreciate this. As a result, women are often denied proper health care for quite serious conditions - even heart disease - while men are given preferential treatment when they complain of these illnesses. 'It is widely assumed women are more ready than men to report illness and to seek help,' said Professor Sally Macintyre, of the Medical Research Council (MRC) social and public health sciences unit, in Glasgow. 'Men - by contrast - are thought to be reluctant visitors to surgeries. So when they do go, their complaints are somehow presumed to have a more serious content.' Yet no study has conclusively supported this idea, she said, despite it being entrenched in the minds of medical practitioners. Recent work by her unit, and other groups, has found that it is men who are more likely to complain to doctors about illnesses, while women are more medically reserved. One analysis carried out by Macintyre, using data collated by researchers at the MRC common cold unit, found that men were significantly more likely to 'over-rate' their sniffles, sore throats, headaches, and shivers compared with ratings given by clinical observers. By contrast, women under-rated their symptoms. Similarly, a US study of men and women affected by osteoarthritis found that men were significantly more likely than women to report pain, whether or not they were undergoing treatment. In a recent study of men and women in Scotland, it was found that men were almost twice as likely as females to say they suffered from long-term medical conditions in response to questions about illness in the most recent national census. Other studies have been less conclusive and have merely found there is no difference between the sexes in their attitudes to illness. Yet it is still commonly assumed by doctors, surgeons, nurses and health workers that women complain more often about illness than men. This 'tendency' is blamed on the fact that women are supposed to have greater concerns about their bodies because they undergo menstruation, childbirth and the menopause, while men are conditioned by society to be strong and stoical. 'It is an attitude that permeates the health service though there is no evidence to support it,' added Macintyre. 'Indeed, it points the other way.' The assumption that men are stoical can also have serious consequences as researchers on both sides of the Atlantic have revealed.

Sunscreen use Attempts to encourage people to use powerful sunblocking lotions to cut skin cancer rates have backfired.

All is still in the late summer heat. From the dog on the bank to the man in his cart, not a leaf stirs, not even a fly. Far above the treetops, the sun rises high in the Suffolk air, shedding its glow over Constable's paradise. Or does it? Look again and you will see that half of England's most reproduced painting is a dispiriting expanse of overcast sky. </p> <p>It is entirely possible that people love The Hay Wain for its moody sky, that rainy, white glare that would in reality hurt the sight. But it seems more likely that we idealise Constable's weather, remembering it as consistent with the warm tranquillity below. In fact, it's a mass of muggy cumuli and shower-laden clouds, with no hope of a breeze to blow them away. Motionless, congested, thick with overlaid oil paint - this is the characteristic Constable sky. </p> <p>Of all the English artists who ever painted summer, Constable is the only one for whom it never turned out sunny. There are no blue skies in his art, no cloudless days, no unfiltered sunlight. You get the feeling he would have been bored to death by a spell of high pressure. For more than 30 years, he stood in Dedham Vale, on Hampstead Heath or by the sea at Brighton, scrutinising the skies for less than clement weather. </p> <p>Of the 80 works in this show, painted while droplets spattered his palette, only a handful are what he called 'skying' studies. But clouds dominate his art to such a degree that practically any show of his pictures might be called Constable's Clouds. </p> <p>So why did he paint them so often and, given that fact, why are his clouds so oddly unimpressive, so little like the ever-changing expressions on the face of English weather? </p> <p>Constable's clouds are completely static. They do not scud or race; they rarely burst with rain or part to reveal a sudden sunny shaft. They are never haloed with light or threaded with silver; they don't hover or spiral or even float. Far from being nebulous, they look claggy and solid. In fact, they don't much resemble vaporous forms at all. </p> <p>Yet Constable is routinely praised as England's great weatherman, from whose paintings you can deduce the wind speed, cloud type or degree of rainfall at a given time and place on that nineteenth-century day. The curators of this show have even included a collection of meteorological instruments as if to reinforce the supposedly scientific accuracy of his work, a reputation which falters when you notice the absence of basic facts like afternoon shadows or motion during squalls. </p> <p>Constable may have noted the climatic details on the back of his pictures, but you only have to look at these images to see that he was not a realist. Flatford Mill, which he loved, enjoys a kind of endless summer whereas Brighton, which he loathed, is punished with rotten weather. A 'fresh morning' on Hampstead Heath will become a turgid and sultry picture, the clouds too tightly packed for the movement of air. Read the accompanying captions and you soon see a parallel between Constable's oil sketches and his private letters, both of them expressive of mercurial moods. </p> <p>Constable, of course, knew the emotional value of weather: the sky, as he famously put it, is 'the chief organ of sentiment' in any landscape. One explanation for his prolific cloud studies is that they amounted to a handy anthology from which he could select the moods for his showpiece paintings. Certainly, it's true that he could and did cheer up the weather for commercial purposes, just as the 'finished' paintings, with their heavy jewellery of highlights, dewdrops and scumbled silver flecks, look a thousand times more artificial than the quick, organic sketches. </p> <p> Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows, for example, has exactly this pick-and-mix appearance. In the foreground, Constable reverses The Hay Wain scenario, so that dog, man and cart face from left to right. The river is his standard gleam of flake-white streaks, curving towards the cathedral. </p> <p>But above them is the most contrived melodrama that he ever painted: a madness of thick puffs, filthy cumuli and caramel-coloured storm clouds, upstaged only by the rainbow that ascends the canvas like a giant, polished banister. </p> <p>To see this massive set-piece surrounded by small, informal sketches is to realise that Constable is nearly always better at six inches than six feet. Restricted to a tiny sheet of paper, he can't go quite so wild with the busy spatters and skirmishes that clog his larger works. </p> <p>With a few liquid sweeps of oil, he can convey a Brighton deluge or diffuse the evening sun in a fine, light haze that is more persuasive than any of his grandstand effects, in which the subject is apt to disappear beneath a quagmire of oil paint. </p> <p>Oil paint is both the medium and the message of his pictures. Where other artists might use transparent watercolour to catch the swift transitions of weather, Constable chooses the heaviest, slowest-drying paint. In the two hours it generally took him to fix each of these cloudscapes, the skies might have changed a hundred times - but never in his art. Oil paint suits Constable's moodiness, his conservatism, his devotion to stability. It suits his desire to control the weather.</p>",

True to his word, the finished building gleams enticingly in the late spring sunlight, reflecting the sky and the water of Salford Quays on the outskirts of Manchester. </p> <p>A corps of cleaners, workmen and ballet-dancers swept through the working areas before last Thursday's opening night, the first performance in England for 17 years by the Paris Opera Ballet. They brought Rudolf Nureyev's spectacular version of <strong> La Bayad\u00e8re</strong>, his last production for the company before his death in 1993. The ballet, which shows off the dancers in depth, also serves to display the theatre that frames it. The Lowry's Lyric boasts the largest stage in Britain outside London. Its purple auditorium perfectly offsets La Bayad\u00e8re 's glowing oriental costumes in Balinese blues, saffron yellow and crimson. </p> <p>The Hall\u00e9 Orchestra played Minkus's 1877 score (reworked by John Lanchbery) under the baton of Vello P\u00e4hn, director of the Paris Opera Orchestra when Nureyev's production was first mounted. The Hall\u00e9 gave Minkus good value, enabling him to be poignant instead of rum-ti-tum. For all that La Bayad\u00e8re is set in India, there is nothing authentically eastern in music or dance. </p> <p>This production, with designs by Ezio Frigerio, drawn from ancient monuments in the Ottoman and Indian empires, is an exotic fantasy for stay-at-homes stuck in a cold climate. </p> <p>Nureyev retrieved numbers that Russian choreographers had added over the century or so since the ballet's St Petersburg premiere, including a solo of his own making for the hero, Solor. He could not supply the missing final act for the ballet, however, so it ends, as did the Kirov's production, with Solor's vision of the Kingdom of the Shades, set in a tropical paradise garden. </p> <p>The Paris Opera Ballet's dancers were not as spectacularly accurate as the Kirov at their best. La Bayad\u00e8re is part of an eclectic POB repertoire rather than a signature ballet, and the refinements of Nureyev's coaching before his last illness seem to be dissipating. </p> <p>The 32 bayad\u00e8res in the Kingdom of the Shades were militarily abrupt, the soloists (and their tempi) unyielding. This was hardly a transcendent experience, especially with a Nikiya seemingly incapable of forgiveness. </p> <p>Agn\u00e8s Letestu is Darcey Bussell's age and height, though her career has not been as fast-track. An inner restraint limits her appeal; she lacks confidence in lifts, although her technique is beautifully unforced. Her Nikiya looks emotionally damaged from the start - no contest for her ruthless rival, Gamzatti, danced with imperious glee by Aur\u00e9lie Dupont. </p> <p>Jean-Guillaume Bart, the company's newest \u00e9toile , seemed to have little problem in choosing between them. He acts with his cheekbones and dances academically, rather than with the fire Nureyev imparted to his immediate successors. </p> <p>Not the greatest performance by the Paris Opera Ballet, then, but a flawless debut for the Lowry Centre's main theatre.</p>",

The 32 bayad\u00e8res in the Kingdom of the Shades were militarily abrupt, the soloists (and their tempi) unyielding. This was hardly a transcendent experience, especially with a Nikiya seemingly incapable of forgiveness. Agn\u00e8s Letestu is Darcey Bussell's age and height, though her career has not been as fast-track. An inner restraint limits her appeal; she lacks confidence in lifts, although her technique is beautifully unforced. Her Nikiya looks emotionally damaged from the start - no contest for her ruthless rival, Gamzatti, danced with imperious glee by Aur\u00e9lie Dupont. Jean-Guillaume Bart, the company's newest \u00e9toile , seemed to have little problem in choosing between them. He acts with his cheekbones and dances academically, rather than with the fire Nureyev imparted to his immediate successors. Not the greatest performance by the Paris Opera Ballet, then, but a flawless debut for the Lowry Centre's main theatre.",

The only sound emitted from the curvaceous brass horn is a hiss, like steam from a pressure cooker. In <b> Sonic Boom Live</b>, a concert to celebrate this pioneering exhibition, the artists whose work it was (Project Dark) went a step further.

In the week that the first Classical Brit Awards celebrated the recycled vapidity which is now sold as 'Classical Music' (the violinist Vanessa-Mae was due to be at last night's ceremony with her new-born puppy), the message had particular piquancy. Not that this was the prime intention of Project Dark. Their work, like others in the exhibition, was a response to a request from the eclectic writer and musician David Toop to participate in the largest ever Sound Art show. The result challenges our notions of sound and silence more rigorously and entertainingly than the Brit Awards ever could, examining one key supposition: 'We think we know how to look. But do we know how to listen?' </p> <p>John Cage addressed that question 40 years ago in his seminal book Silence. In an interview in this newspaper, he recalled how Schoenberg had once accused him of having no ear for music, which meant that as a composer he would always come up against a brick wall. 'I said, well then, I'll beat my head against that wall; and I quite literally began hitting things, and developed a music of percussion that involved noises.' He wasn't the first to make strange sounds and call it music - the Italian Futurists, with their anarchic Sound War evenings featuring Russola's 'intoning machines', were there in the 1920s. But Cage was the first to have a coherent alternative philosophy of music which embraced (with love) the totality of sound. Sonic Boom, with its dazzling array of installations - including a record-player driven by an exercise bicycle and a robotic, one-man jazz band - should be obligatory for all ears fatigued by the bleeps and Muzak of everyday life. </p> <p>The <b> Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</b>'s concert devoted to the music of Peter Maxwell Davies provided its own kind of sonic retort by drawing on vast orchestral resources and extremes of pitch and volume. Davies, now in his mid-sixties and still impish, if no longer quite the rebel he once was, has a close association with the RPO, who play his music with warm conviction. Ever prolific, he had two world premieres in this concert, though no special fanfare preceded the event. </p> <p>The centrepiece was a horn concerto supplicatingly written for the versatile Richard Watkins. This single-movement work exploits the full spectrum of sounds of which the instrument is capable, making intimidating demands on the soloist. Watkins tossed off the runs and trills, flourishes and volleys of notes effortlessly, with well-disciplined support from the orchestra. </p> <p>The other new work, entitled Roma, Amor, Labyrinthos, was an enormous, impressionistic, three-movement tone poem to the Eternal City in which the young Maxwell Davies studied composition in the late Fifties. Intentionally overblown and bombastic, with an intoning machine's-worth of low woodwind, trombones and tuba, it portrays a Rome of jackboots, traffic and baroque gesture. A misty central movement suggests the city's mysterious intimacy. </p> <p>Davies's compositions in maturity lack the full taut economy of his earlier works, and at times sound in danger of being just a little too slack. But this was an enjoyable concert which would have been ideal as a live broadcast, tempting a nervous listener to try out contemporary music at its most approachable. No microphones were in sight. </p> <p>Radio 3 may not have been in evidence at the Barbican. It certainly will be, however, when Maxwell Davies conducts his Symphony No 7 at the Albert Hall in July, one of 15 BBC commissions in the 2000 Season of <b> Proms</b>. The new programme of 72 concerts (10 of which will be televised) was announced last week in the fitting setting of St Sepulchre-without-New gate where Sir Henry Wood, beloved Cockney originator of the festival, is buried. The choir of King's College, Cambridge sang Britten's 'Jubilate' and a Bach 'Alleluia', reminding us that one of this year's themes is Music and God while another is Bach on his 250th anniversary. </p> <p>This year's innovations include a day of concert by the young for the young, a programme of newly fashionable Cuban music and a brave revival of the Sixties idea of Poetry Proms. The big sellouts are likely to be Evgeny Kissin on the first night, Jessye Norman's solo recital and Simon Rattle conducting Parsifal, his first Wagner opera in Britain. Booking opens on 15 May.

I was not looking forward to the first night at all. Nothing about the advance publicity, showing Elaine Paige looking like an overgrown Bo Peep, whetted my appetite for Rodgers and Hammerstein's golden oldie. So I went on my own - a matter of duty, not pleasure. </p> <p>It is always a delight to have one's prejudices knocked to the ground, as if in a lethal kung-fu manoeuvre. And Jason Scott Lee (best known in the title role of Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story) playing the King was just the man to effect such a move. But first - did I say golden oldie? Golden was the word. Brian Thomson's gold and scarlet set is stunning: constellated, spangled, fantastically and rampantly oriental. Not content with having two curvaceous scarlet elephants with turquoise eyes framing the stage, the Milky Way is thrown in and even humble merchants' wares look like priceless jewelled trees. </p> <p>The trouble with Elaine Paige is that she is always Elaine Paige first and the character she is playing second. But in the role of Mrs Anna, the widowed English teacher who has known what it is to love and thinks she knows what it is to teach, this does not matter. Paige hospitably makes room for the role and its gorgeous songs. Her habitual expression is that of someone who has just had a mouthful of eye-smartingly cold ice-cream, which she finds enjoyable but shocking at the same time. In her low-cut vanilla frock, there is something altogether soft scoop about Mrs Anna. She is everyone's favourite treat. </p> <p>Paige is a wonderfully entertaining contrast to the King, just as she should be. Lee pulls off the unusual feat of shouting and disarming at the same time. He is like an impossible pupil, bare-chested and in gold breeches, a know-it-all who is afraid of his own ignorance. The King's wives make a beguiling chorus line, flashing not their legs but their extended gold nails like seductive starfish. And how I wished I'd taken my nieces along to gasp at their exotic dresses (costumes by Roger Kirk). Tuptim (Aura Deva) is a 'present from a Burmese prince' and looks like one - in sublime wrapping paper.</p> <p>But the star of the evening is the King's senior wife Lady Thiang. Taewon Yi Kim (who sang the role in the New York cast) has a beautiful singing voice. Her 'Something Wonderful' is just that. Christopher Renshaw's production manages to be charming as well as spectacular. No one could resist the sight of the King's children - (we meet a selection of the 67). Each is delicately characterised: a swot, a dreamer, a flower girl, a boy who wants to run away. This show started life in Australia in 1991. In its new incarnation, I'd like to award it a medal (a gold one, of course, encrusted with jewels). </p> <p>The longest kiss in the history of kisses is in progress at the Young Vic Studio. Standing on an island above the audience, Poseidon's helpers are wrapped - rapt too - in each other. Water curtains the stage and fills a dark moat below. Going to <strong> Poseidon</strong> is like stepping into a dream. It is a sequel to Icarus Falling, Primitive Science's first show, praised for its beauty. </p> <p>Poseidon is unenthusiastic about his ravishing environs: he fears water. He wishes he had got Zeus's job. Patrick Driver plays Poseidon but his thoughts are decorously conveyed by a second actor (Jerry Killick) - a one-man Greek chorus. One of the conceits of the piece is that all around us there are gods pretending to be mortal. Photos of the gods in curly silver frames are produced. Hades looks especially gormless, like a favourite grandfather. We are asked: 'Isn't it funny what supreme beings will do in order not to be recognised?' You might want to take this with a pinch of salt.</p> <p>If so, it will not be difficult: Poseidon's helpers tip salt into the sea from silver shakers while Poseidon miserably combs his moustache with a small fork. The helpers are a mysterious French-speaking couple; the girl (Solveig Simha) looks like a mermaid, her bodice encrusted with sequinned barnacles. Hermes (entertainingly played by Boz Temple-Morris) wears a long silver mackintosh and quaint green shoes with golden spikes. He has come to tell Poseidon that no one believes in him any more. This show makes a glittering tale out of redundancy. Something that Marc Von Henning, its talented writer-director, and Dick Bird, its superlative designer, will with luck never have to face. </p> <p>There is more talent to gladden the heart this week, though Helen Blakeman's subject is as bleak as could be. <strong> Normal</strong>, capably directed by Mike Bradwell, is about women who are destructive. Holly (Emma Pike) might be considered sane. She is a student who makes money out of telephone sex. She is nasty, good-looking and lonely. She wants to have her breasts enlarged for a reduced fee. She tries to seduce the consultant with this aim in mind. Superficially, she could not be more different from her flatmate Kate. But Kate is lonely too and mutilates herself - she needs no surgeon. Both girls seduce the same man; the structure is accomplished, like being in a hall of mirrors where everything reflects back on itself. </p> <p>This is Blakeman's second play. It is depressing but funny and compassionate too. Lisa Ellis plays Kate like a fledgling who needs to drop out of the nest when her mother (Marion Bayley) turns vulture. She almost finds a friend in Todd (Ben Crompton) who, when she says she has failed her exams, pays her this compliment: 'That is not the rucksack of an unintelligent lady.' I look forward to seeing more from the Blakeman rucksack. </p> <p>\u0095 Susannah Clapp is on holiday</p>",

The trouble with Elaine Paige is that she is always Elaine Paige first and the character she is playing second. But in the role of Mrs Anna, the widowed English teacher who has known what it is to love and thinks she knows what it is to teach, this does not matter. Paige hospitably makes room for the role and its gorgeous songs. Her habitual expression is that of someone who has just had a mouthful of eye-smartingly cold ice-cream, which she finds enjoyable but shocking at the same time. In her low-cut vanilla frock, there is something altogether soft scoop about Mrs Anna. She is everyone's favourite treat. Paige is a wonderfully entertaining contrast to the King, just as she should be. Lee pulls off the unusual feat of shouting and disarming at the same time. He is like an impossible pupil, bare-chested and in gold breeches, a know-it-all who is afraid of his own ignorance. The King's wives make a beguiling chorus line, flashing not their legs but their extended gold nails like seductive starfish. And how I wished I'd taken my nieces along to gasp at their exotic dresses (costumes by Roger Kirk). Tuptim (Aura Deva) is a 'present from a Burmese prince' and looks like one - in sublime wrapping paper. But the star of the evening is the King's senior wife Lady Thiang. Taewon Yi Kim (who sang the role in the New York cast) has a beautiful singing voice. Her 'Something Wonderful' is just that. Christopher Renshaw's production manages to be charming as well as spectacular. No one could resist the sight of the King's children - (we meet a selection of the 67). Each is delicately characterised: a swot, a dreamer, a flower girl, a boy who wants to run away. This show started life in Australia in 1991. In its new incarnation, I'd like to award it a medal (a gold one, of course, encrusted with jewels). The longest kiss in the history of kisses is in progress at the Young Vic Studio. Standing on an island above the audience, Poseidon's helpers are wrapped - rapt too - in each other. Water curtains the stage and fills a dark moat below. Going to Poseidon is like stepping into a dream. It is a sequel to Icarus Falling, Primitive Science's first show, praised for its beauty. Poseidon is unenthusiastic about his ravishing environs: he fears water. He wishes he had got Zeus's job. Patrick Driver plays Poseidon but his thoughts are decorously conveyed by a second actor (Jerry Killick) - a one-man Greek chorus. One of the conceits of the piece is that all around us there are gods pretending to be mortal. Photos of the gods in curly silver frames are produced. Hades looks especially gormless, like a favourite grandfather. We are asked: 'Isn't it funny what supreme beings will do in order not to be recognised?' You might want to take this with a pinch of salt. If so, it will not be difficult: Poseidon's helpers tip salt into the sea from silver shakers while Poseidon miserably combs his moustache with a small fork. The helpers are a mysterious French-speaking couple; the girl (Solveig Simha) looks like a mermaid, her bodice encrusted with sequinned barnacles. Hermes (entertainingly played by Boz Temple-Morris) wears a long silver mackintosh and quaint green shoes with golden spikes. He has come to tell Poseidon that no one believes in him any more. This show makes a glittering tale out of redundancy. Something that Marc Von Henning, its talented writer-director, and Dick Bird, its superlative designer, will with luck never have to face. There is more talent to gladden the heart this week, though Helen Blakeman's subject is as bleak as could be. Normal, capably directed by Mike Bradwell, is about women who are destructive. Holly (Emma Pike) might be considered sane. She is a student who makes money out of telephone sex. She is nasty, good-looking and lonely. She wants to have her breasts enlarged for a reduced fee. She tries to seduce the consultant with this aim in mind. Superficially, she could not be more different from her flatmate Kate. But Kate is lonely too and mutilates herself - she needs no surgeon. Both girls seduce the same man; the structure is accomplished, like being in a hall of mirrors where everything reflects back on itself. This is Blakeman's second play. It is depressing but funny and compassionate too. Lisa Ellis plays Kate like a fledgling who needs to drop out of the nest when her mother (Marion Bayley) turns vulture. She almost finds a friend in Todd (Ben Crompton) who, when she says she has failed her exams, pays her this compliment: 'That is not the rucksack of an unintelligent lady.' I look forward to seeing more from the Blakeman rucksack. \u0095 Susannah Clapp is on holiday",

He'd become the leading light of the Czech new wave with his quirky celebrations of non-conformity and eccentricity - Black Peter, Loves of a Blonde and The Firemen's Ball. Three years later, though pursuing similar themes, he emerged as an American director with Taking Off, his comedy of life on both sides of the generation gap produced by the emergence of the 1960s counterculture. It remains one of the best films on that turbulent period. </p> <p>Since then, Forman has been at his best dealing with anti-authoritarian outsiders in America, such as the rebellious Randall P. McMurphy leading the asylum inmates of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and the libertarian porn-merchant defending free speech in The People v Larry Flynt. He's been least good revisiting Europe to direct the staid costume movies Amadeus and Valmont. </p> <p>Forman might well have made Ed Wood, but instead he engaged the authors of its screenplay, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, to write Man on the Moon, a movie about Andy Kaufman, the oddball comedian whose true aims are as difficult to pin down as Larry Flynt's. </p> <p>Kaufman emerged from a middle-class Jewish home on Long Island to puzzle, amuse and disturb America for a decade before dying of a rare form of lung cancer in 1984 at the age of 35. He is best known outside America for his role as Latka Gravas, the syntactically-challenged immigrant engineer, one of the regular blue-collar eccentrics in the cult sitcom Taxi, which ran from 1978 to 1983. </p> <p>This delightful piece of character comedy endeared him to the general public, but his significance resides in the way he set out to provoke, annoy and alienate both his audience and his colleagues. Kaufman invented an alter ego, or rather an alter id, called Tony Clifton, a slobbish, racist, third-rate Las Vegas club performer, usually played by himself but occasionally by his partner and fellow provocateur, Bob Zmuda, and they even managed to get Clifton ejected from the Paramount lot. </p> <p>Kaufman deliberately got up the nostrils of women and Southerners by staging bouts of all-in wrestling between himself and female challengers in Memphis. He emptied an auditorium of student fans in Arizona by refusing to reprise Latka Gravas for them and instead reading the whole of The Great Gatsby in a fruity English accent. He booked Carnegie Hall for a concert, but confronted those who came to be outraged with a kitschy version of a Radio City Music Hall Christmas show complete with Rockettes and Santa Claus. Eventually, he achieved his ambition of estranging most of his followers and failing to be believed when he said he had cancer. </p> <p>Kaufman was a role player in the tradition of that archetypal American figure, the chameleon confidence trickster and, in Jim Carrey's bravura performance, Kaufman is always performing. The movie is a single, extended turn that incorporates smaller ones on and off stage. </p> <p>Forman uses his formidable skills as a documentarian and a director of actors to recreate TV appearances, club acts and stage shows. They're indistinguishable from the real thing and, in fact, the scenes involving Taxi are performed by Carrey with Christopher Lloyd, Marilu Henner, Judd Hirsch, Carol Kane and other members of the original cast. Of course, Danny De Vito can't play himself in Taxi as he's been cast as George Shapiro, Kaufman's devoted but constantly exasperated agent. </p> <p>Shapiro, De Vito and Bob Zmuda have co-produced the film, with Kaufman's live-in girlfriend, Lynne Margulies (played on screen by Courtney Love), as 'creative consultant'. But either these friends are determined to preserve Kaufman's central mystery or they don't know what makes him tick. </p> <p>'That kid is totally meshugga,' Andy's father says, using an affectionate Yiddish term for madness. 'You're insane but you might be brilliant,' says Shapiro after signing him up. 'I don't do jokes; I don't know what's funny; I'm just a song-and-dance man,' says Kaufman. </p> <p>We're left to make up our own minds and to me Kaufman seems a descendant of two figures from the 1950s - Guy Grand, the malevolent practical joker in Terry Southern's The Magic Christian and Lenny Bruce - satirists who were obsessed with the essential absurdity of life who ventured beyond the realms of morality and reason. </p> <p>Certainly, Kaufman denies people the traditional consolations of humour, though when he engaged in transcendental meditation, was he seeking something or sending it up? And when he took a sentimental turn, was he exposing American sentimentality or embracing it? </p> <p>Observing the proceedings, incidentally, is Victor Schiavelli, a curious, very un-American-looking actor with a long, thin face, high forehead and piercing eyes, who has recurred in Forman's movies since he appeared in Taking Off as the supercilious hippie who instructs members of the Society for the Parents of Fugitive Children on the etiquette of pot-smoking. </p> <p>Here, he's a TV executive, variously infuriated, baffled and amused by Kaufman and, one suspects, he's reflecting Forman's own response. I'd have to say, though, that Kaufman, whose Tony Clifton persona is close to Sir Les Patterson, is a good deal less funny than his postmodern contemporary, Barry Humphries.</p>",

Like Anna Karina in that earlier movie, Katrin Cartlidge despises her clients, is at the mercy of a sadistic pimp (Colm Meaney), and attempts to break away and live an ordinary life with a young lover (Vincent D'Onofrio). </p> <p>This good-looking minimalist film is all hard, cold surfaces of anonymous New York bars, flats and hotel rooms, full of mirrors that mock the icy heroine. We never learn how Claire became a whore, but then this isn't a sociological movie but a study in loneliness, exile, alienation. I didn't believe a word of it and found it willed rather than imagined. </p> <p>Ben Younger's business thriller, <strong> Boiler Room</strong>, has more blood in its veins, much of it in the form of transfusions from other pictures. The pale, pinch-faced Giovanni Ribisi plays a clever 19-year-old college drop-out who - to impress his father, a stern federal judge (Ron Rifkin) - takes a job with a corrupt stockbroking firm that seduces and fleeces avaricious investors on the phone. Just after it's struck us how much the induction lecture by demonic, fast-talking Ben Affleck resembles the opening of Glengarry Glen Ross, someone says 'Have you seen Glengarry Glen Ross ?' When we start recognising echoes of Wall Street, there's a scene of the young brokers swilling beer, eating pizza and watching a video of their hero, Gordon Gekko in Wall Street. Boiler Room seems an authentic depiction of their empty, desperate, immoral lives. </p> <p>The other American movie, <strong> Trick</strong>, is a charming comedy about a shy young would-be composer of Broadway musicals (Christian Campbell) who shares a New York flat with an obnoxious straight friend, and can't find anywhere to have sex with the handsome go-go dancer (John Paul Pitoc) he picks up in a gay bar. As they search in vain, lust turns to love in a touching, old-fashioned way and they part at dawn, their romance still to be consummated. Tori Spelling is very funny as the hero's loud-mouthed actress chum (currently appearing off-off-Broadway in an all-girl version of Wilde's Salome) and there's a walk-on appearance as a waitress by Helene Hanff of 84 Charing Cross Road fame. </p> <p>The other five pictures are British, four of them varying from the indifferent to the dreadful. All but one are products of the present Lottery-created glut, a situation reminiscent of a similar superfluity that resulted 50 years ago when a Labour government in dispute with Hollywood encouraged our film industry to put every available half-baked script into production. </p> <p>The one good picture is a re-issue of the 20-year-old <strong> The Long Good Friday</strong>, one of the best British crime movies, in which a lot of people get electrocuted when some wires are crossed between the IRA and an underworld scheme to renovate the London docklands. Barrie Keeffe's dialogue is as sharp as a cutthroat razor and at the head of a fine cast Bob Hoskins gives a performance that can be spoken of in the same snarl as Edward G. Robinson's Rico Bandello in Little Caesar. </p> <p>After The Long Good Friday, the flashy, Brighton-set <strong> Circus</strong> is a dull, derivative thriller in which gambler John Hannah and three imported American actors tangle with mobsters and a double-crossing plot more demented than ingenious. This is the useless suspects, reservoir dregs, the scrapings of two smoking barrels. </p> <p>Adapted by John Banville from Elizabeth Bowen's novel, <strong> The Last September</strong> is the disappointing cinematic debut of the gifted stage director Deborah Warner. With a deal of incidental implausibility and an overall tedium, it covers sub-Chekhovian territory familiar from TV and movie adaptations of novels by William Trevor, J.G. Farrell and Jennifer Johnson about the last days of the detached Anglo-Irish landed gentry, as the IRA and the Black and Tans do battle around their country houses in the Troubles of 80 years ago. Inevitably, a young woman is torn between her upper-middle-class heritage and a handsome Irish revolutionary, who in this case looks uncannily like Brendan Behan after a night on the town. </p> <p>The remaining two pictures - both arch, heavyhanded comedies - also feature Celtic heroines. Marginally the better, <strong> House!</strong> has a 'small-and-decrepit-is-beautiful' plot about a young girl (Kelly Macdonald) in South Wales using her hereditary psychic powers to save the rundown bingo hall where she works from being put out of business by a soulless rival establishment. To emphasise the Ealingesque associations, the hall's ancient proprietor (Freddie Jones) hears lines from the soundtracks of The Man in the White Suit and The Ladykillers as he contemplates the grand history of his crumbling establishment. </p> <p>Bad almost beyond belief, <strong> Janice Beard: 45wpm</strong> has a fantasising, charmless Scottish heroine (Eileen Walsh) coming to London to work as a temp and save a motor company from extinction. With an undeveloped script, lame dialogue and a childlike view of the business world, this is an updating of one of those old George Formby and Norman Wisdom comedies. But instead of a gormless hero there's a gormless heroine - not a good idea - and a male replaces the vamping femme fatale, in this case an industrial spy posing as an office boy, who is played by the ubiquitous Rhys Ifans.</p>",

To emphasise the Ealingesque associations, the hall's ancient proprietor (Freddie Jones) hears lines from the soundtracks of The Man in the White Suit and The Ladykillers as he contemplates the grand history of his crumbling establishment. Bad almost beyond belief, Janice Beard: 45wpm has a fantasising, charmless Scottish heroine (Eileen Walsh) coming to London to work as a temp and save a motor company from extinction. With an undeveloped script, lame dialogue and a childlike view of the business world, this is an updating of one of those old George Formby and Norman Wisdom comedies. But instead of a gormless hero there's a gormless heroine - not a good idea - and a male replaces the vamping femme fatale, in this case an industrial spy posing as an office boy, who is played by the ubiquitous Rhys Ifans.",

      "body": "<p>The lift goes up and up, and eventually stops at Light Entertainment Heaven, which many sensible souls would surely regard as a hellish place to be. Here on the fifteenth floor of a central London hotel, while foreign guests are tucking into their \u00a313.95 Full English Breakfasts, BBC gods Terry Wogan and Alan Titchmarsh are engaging in cocklewarming green-room banter, the stuff of a hundred TV charity specials. 'It's you! You're following me!' says Wogan, though in fact he was the last to arrive. 'I saw you at the Ivy last night.' </p> <p>'Were you there?' Titchmarsh bounces on the edge of his seat. 'So was Donald Sutherland!' </p> <p>'I doubt', says Wogan, with morose sagacity, 'that he knew who either of us were.' </p> <p>A surprisingly brown man in charcoal suit, periwinkle shirt and lemon tie, he prepares for his close-up by gazing out, a captain on the high seas, over Portland Place towards the smooth white cliffs of Broadcasting House where he has just finished his Radio 2 show. 'No, nothing for me there. I hope you're taking this from above,' he admonishes John, the photographer. 'At my age, I have to be shot from above. Jesus, with three chins, it's kindness.' </p> <p>In between poses, he and Titchmarsh are comparing the cuts and grazes inflicted on them by broadsheet hacks. I find it rather shocking to hear Wogan - popularly believed to be the Beeb's equivalent of the Costas because of his ceaselessly sunny good nature - refer to one interviewer from another broadsheet, who said some quite unkind things about his hair, as 'fat and ugly'.</p> <p>It occurs to me that this is a shot across the bow, and for a moment, I see him in an entirely different and rather exciting light, closer to the sinister Wogan figure he played in Bob Martin, a Godfather type who was malevolently territorial about Michael Barrymore's attempts to take over the Eurovision presenting slot. But then Titchmarsh expertly defuses the tension with a smooth 'So she didn't like you, then?' and Terry laughs, and it's another safe daytime moment. (In case you are curious, though the Wogan 'do' is certainly idiosyncratic, it does not really resemble 'a hairy croissant', and is convincingly threaded with white.) </p> <p>For most of our meeting he is Velcro'd to his trademark tone of amiably surreal self-deprecation: a tone which echoes throughout the BBC's L.E. archive, from the Radio 2 breakfast show, which he has presented intermittently since 1972, through to Celebrity Squares, Come Dancing, Blankety Blank and the Eurovision Song Contest, due to kick off this Saturday in Stockholm. </p> <p>Eurovision is perceived as his annual Finest Hour, or three. Though he has reported on it since 'just after the Napoleonic Wars', it has only comparatively recently become a plum date in the kitsch calendar, and the subject of camp West End musicals. Much of its popularity is due to Wogan's commentary, which has turned him into a cult figure and hero of Chris Evans. Not bad for a 64-year-old blazer-wearer who was widely believed to be washed up in 1992, when his knee-patting chat show was axed to make way for Eldorado. </p> <p>Eurovision is as soft a target as room-temperature butter, but Wogan is, as the Guardian 's Nancy Banks-Smith observes fondly, 'a lifebelt presence' on the night: his observations on costumes, tunes, sets and the folk dances of the host country always nail the absurdity of the moment, and leave you rolling helplessly on the carpet.</p> <p>It's a skill of which Wogan is vaguely dismissive. He is robust about what makes for popular broadcasting, saying that it invariably boils down to predictability and repetition. 'I'm reflecting what the viewer's thinking. Perhaps I say it just a beat before they say it. It's like answering questions on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, just getting the answer in quickly.' He admits that he has marked his life out in Song Contests. 'It's like the Horse of the Year Show. It seems to come up every six weeks. You think: Oh God, not again!' </p> <p>Whether or not you believe Wogan when he insists that the rest of Europe - and Israel, of course, let's not forget Israel - considers the Eurovision itself a cultural highpoint, 'a feast of fine music', is another matter entirely, and possibly not a laughing one. </p> <p>'This year will not disappoint,' he declares. 'I have seen the previews. I would advise anyone, even if the worse for drink, to stay awake for the Swedish entry. Every so often the Swedes have a rush of blood to the head and take off to the far north and reinvent their Lapp traditions. I won't say more than that. I can only say that it is bizarre.' </p> <p>Wogan is often accused of being bland but in fact he is a master of the bizarre: his Radio 2 show, peppered with catchphrases such as 'I'll put that in a glass case and throw sugar at it', is completely incomprehensible to the first-time listener. And yet the first-time listeners keep breaking the pain barrier and returning for a diet of 'maundering' and Roy Orbison records: audience figures are extremely healthy, more than seven million at the last count, not far off the eight million who were tuning in before he abandoned Radio 2 for TV in the mid-Eighties. </p> <p>He gets 600 e-mails a day, many of which fuel whimsical digressions, but he never visualises his listeners: he has a horror of 'having to address an audience full of people'. It's certainly true that he makes a beeline for the seat alongside me on the banquette, making eye contact virtually impossible. And still, at this remove, his charm is ticklish and insistent: a feather duster wielded at arm's length. </p> <p>As a schoolboy, he came home and firmly shut the garden gate behind him, to keep out the rest of the world. 'I've always wanted my own space, I've always been happy on my own. I'm not particularly gregarious, and that's probably ideal for being a broadcaster. I like talking to myself, maundering on.' When asked a few years ago about how his nationality had influenced his personality, he answered: 'A fear of silence. The Irish abhor a vacuum, particularly in conversation.' </p> <p>On air, he is relentlessly, brilliantly trivial. 'Why should my opinion count for anything? I don't think you have a right, because of an accident, to lumber people with your subjective opinions. Better to keep your nose clean.' But this seeps over into the way he seems to view his life, too. When he tells me about a letter bomb being sent to him at Broadcasting House, he's much more interested in the gag ('All the traffic stopped! \"A bomb for Terry!\" The only thing is, this person could not have been a regular listener, because I was away at the time!') than in the 'loony' who sent it to him in the first place. </p> <p>Michael Terence Wogan was born in Limerick, the son of a 'grocer's curate' at Leverett &amp; Fry who went on to become managing director. Since his dad was also christened Michael, his mother called him Terry, which is 'not a name I've ever been tremendously fond of. I'd rather have been called something more manly... Rot Gonad, for instance.' </p> <p>The elder of two boys (his brother works for Aer Lingus), Wogan was educated by Jesuits who extolled the values of humility and self-control. He describes himself as entirely without ambition, which makes it all the more odd that as a 21-year-old bank clerk, he bothered to respond to an ad for RTE newsreaders in the paper. Wogan's letter was one of 5,000 and yet, with no experience, he got the job. What had galvanised him to apply? Wogan is not helpful. 'I don't know. I was a great radio listener ... TV hadn't started in Ireland at the time, so we used to watch the BBC. Coming down the hill into Dublin, all you could see were these minor pylons, 40 to 50ft aerials, sticking up into the sky, getting fringe reception. I don't know why I got the job, to be honest.' </p> <p>But he made a name for himself, and when Radio 1 launched, he was in the station's inaugural line-up, his Irishness rendering him safely classless. Eventually, he and Helen, whom he calls 'the current Mrs Wogan' (they've been married for 35 years), sold their house in Ireland and moved over to the Home Counties, where they raised three children. They have no plans to go back. </p> <p>Wogan is reluctant to analyse his motives or success. Perhaps he is keeping his powder dry in preparation for his autobiography, which comes out in September, but he does seem almost superstitious when talking about his career, like a nervous traveller who suspects the plane might fall out of the sky if they stopped to think about the unlikeliness of flight. He never watches himself on telly, for instance. 'You might watch yourself and think, \"Oh, that's an appealing thing I did there, oh, that's attractive\", and then you might end up winking like Anne Robinson for the rest of your life, trapped in what you fancied was an engaging little habit.' </p> <p>He hates preparation. While presenting Wogan, he was famous for doing as little research on his guests as possible. 'I'm a great believer in spontaneity, mainly because I don't have the capacity to take pains. My father used to take enormous pains. He was a fly fisherman, and we used to go out on a Sunday, and the sun would be going down before he cast the first fly out over the river. What he really liked to do was tie the flies and get ready, and naturally this built up resentment in a young man. If it didn't come easily, I walked away from it.' </p> <p>Much of this insouciance is a pose, but Wogan is far less sentimental than I'd expected. The BBC, with whom he will always be inextricably linked in the popular imagination, comes in for a big rubbishing. Auntie's bloomers? More like Auntie's fig leaf. BBC Talent is 'nonsense. The BBC is inundated with tapes and videos and scripts every day of the year, and all you've got to do is employ somebody who actually knows something about scripts or presenters to analyse the mail. A total waste of time.'</p> <p>Would he do a Des Lynam? 'Of course I would. I have no loyalty to the BBC. The BBC doesn't care about me. It doesn't give a toss about me!' He thinks he's washed up on telly, with the exception of the Eurovision, and is even toying with the idea of not renewing his Radio 2 contract when it runs out (if it gets that far. He implies, darkly, that the BBC may not want to keep him on). 'I'm giving it another two years and then I shall be so well advanced in years that I probably won't be able to get out of bed.' </p> <p>Perhaps he means it; perhaps he doesn't. But his public is unlikely to let him go without a fight. As we say goodbye, Terry opens his brown briefcase and there, alongside what looks suspiciously like a tube of cover-up, is a strange object: a fabric portrait of the man himself, framed and ready to pop on the mantelpiece. 'It took a sub-editor on Cross Stitch magazine 60 hours to do this,' he says, in the same baffled tones that we will be hearing next Saturday. What on earth will he do with it? 'I'll put it in a glass case and throw sugar at it.'</p> <p><strong>Eurovision 2000: a preview of the worst lyrics</strong></p> <p><strong> Norway </strong> 'My Heart Goes Boom' performed by Charmed 'A radio was singing/ Something blue in perfect tune/ Half a smile as you sat down/ I couldn't seem to keep my eyes on you' </p> <p><strong> Romania </strong> 'The Moon' performed by Taxi 'And I listen how the wind/ Is playing among the stars on night/ And I don't think I want more/ But I wait for the moon/ To play hide and seek into your hair/ My heart will always beat for you' </p> <p><strong> Germany </strong> 'What Do You Have There?' performed by Stefan Raab 'What do you have there?/ What do you have there?/ What do you have there?/ What do you have there?' </p> <p><strong> Belgium </strong> 'I want to Live' performed by Nathalie Sorce 'The wish to live for eternity/ The wish to live has gone past us/ The wish to life will remain enamelled/ Like in a book we have discovered again' </p> <p><strong> Israel </strong> 'Happy' performed by The Ping Pong Band 'Ho...

And still, at this remove, his charm is ticklish and insistent: a feather duster wielded at arm's length. As a schoolboy, he came home and firmly shut the garden gate behind him, to keep out the rest of the world. 'I've always wanted my own space, I've always been happy on my own. I'm not particularly gregarious, and that's probably ideal for being a broadcaster. I like talking to myself, maundering on.' When asked a few years ago about how his nationality had influenced his personality, he answered: 'A fear of silence. The Irish abhor a vacuum, particularly in conversation.' On air, he is relentlessly, brilliantly trivial. 'Why should my opinion count for anything? I don't think you have a right, because of an accident, to lumber people with your subjective opinions. Better to keep your nose clean.' But this seeps over into the way he seems to view his life, too. When he tells me about a letter bomb being sent to him at Broadcasting House, he's much more interested in the gag ('All the traffic stopped! \"A bomb for Terry!\" The only thing is, this person could not have been a regular listener, because I was away at the time!') than in the 'loony' who sent it to him in the first place. Michael Terence Wogan was born in Limerick, the son of a 'grocer's curate' at Leverett &amp; Fry who went on to become managing director. Since his dad was also christened Michael, his mother called him Terry, which is 'not a name I've ever been tremendously fond of. I'd rather have been called something more manly... Rot Gonad, for instance.' The elder of two boys (his brother works for Aer Lingus), Wogan was educated by Jesuits who extolled the values of humility and self-control. He describes himself as entirely without ambition, which makes it all the more odd that as a 21-year-old bank clerk, he bothered to respond to an ad for RTE newsreaders in the paper. Wogan's letter was one of 5,000 and yet, with no experience, he got the job. What had galvanised him to apply? Wogan is not helpful. 'I don't know. I was a great radio listener ... TV hadn't started in Ireland at the time, so we used to watch the BBC. Coming down the hill into Dublin, all you could see were these minor pylons, 40 to 50ft aerials, sticking up into the sky, getting fringe reception. I don't know why I got the job, to be honest.' But he made a name for himself, and when Radio 1 launched, he was in the station's inaugural line-up, his Irishness rendering him safely classless. Eventually, he and Helen, whom he calls 'the current Mrs Wogan' (they've been married for 35 years), sold their house in Ireland and moved over to the Home Counties, where they raised three children. They have no plans to go back. Wogan is reluctant to analyse his motives or success. Perhaps he is keeping his powder dry in preparation for his autobiography, which comes out in September, but he does seem almost superstitious when talking about his career, like a nervous traveller who suspects the plane might fall out of the sky if they stopped to think about the unlikeliness of flight. He never watches himself on telly, for instance. 'You might watch yourself and think, \"Oh, that's an appealing thing I did there, oh, that's attractive\", and then you might end up winking like Anne Robinson for the rest of your life, trapped in what you fancied was an engaging little habit.' He hates preparation. While presenting Wogan, he was famous for doing as little research on his guests as possible. 'I'm a great believer in spontaneity, mainly because I don't have the capacity to take pains. My father used to take enormous pains. He was a fly fisherman, and we used to go out on a Sunday, and the sun would be going down before he cast the first fly out over the river. What he really liked to do was tie the flies and get ready, and naturally this built up resentment in a young man. If it didn't come easily, I walked away from it.' Much of this insouciance is a pose, but Wogan is far less sentimental than I'd expected. The BBC, with whom he will always be inextricably linked in the popular imagination, comes in for a big rubbishing. Auntie's bloomers? More like Auntie's fig leaf. BBC Talent is 'nonsense. The BBC is inundated with tapes and videos and scripts every day of the year, and all you've got to do is employ somebody who actually knows something about scripts or presenters to analyse the mail. A total waste of time.' Would he do a Des Lynam? 'Of course I would. I have no loyalty to the BBC. The BBC doesn't care about me. It doesn't give a toss about me!' He thinks he's washed up on telly, with the exception of the Eurovision, and is even toying with the idea of not renewing his Radio 2 contract when it runs out (if it gets that far. He implies, darkly, that the BBC may not want to keep him on). 'I'm giving it another two years and then I shall be so well advanced in years that I probably won't be able to get out of bed.' Perhaps he means it; perhaps he doesn't. But his public is unlikely to let him go without a fight. As we say goodbye, Terry opens his brown briefcase and there, alongside what looks suspiciously like a tube of cover-up, is a strange object: a fabric portrait of the man himself, framed and ready to pop on the mantelpiece. 'It took a sub-editor on Cross Stitch magazine 60 hours to do this,' he says, in the same baffled tones that we will be hearing next Saturday. What on earth will he do with it? 'I'll put it in a glass case and throw sugar at it.'

Practical jokes rehearse a hostility which threatens to erode trust, subvert social relations and call reality itself into question. Then, after inducing a metaphysical dread, the triumphant joker dares his victim not to laugh. </p> <p>This particular experiment in relativising sacred certainties began, aptly enough, during a debate about the possible destruction of our safe, solid physical world. In Michael Frayn's Copenhagen, Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg meet in 1941 to discuss the riddle of atomic fission, which will win the war for one side or the other. Last year, just before the play's transfer from the National Theatre to the West End, Frayn received from a woman called Celia Rhys-Evans a parcel of blotched, tattered papers, allegedly unearthed in the house where Heisenberg was interned when the bomb fell on Hiroshima. </p> <p>He became convinced, as he enticed more details from his unknown source, that he was reading a secret history of the events his play had fictionalised. After many months of obsessed speculation, he discovered that it was a hoax, dreamed up by the actor David Burke while he was playing the guileless, near-saintly Bohr. Burke had written in a yellowing ledger with antique pens, wet the pages and then tumble-dried them to make them look authentically elderly. He and Frayn have now collaborated on Celia's Secret, a book about the maniacally elaborate prank.</p> <p>Burke has a long history of forgery, fraud and psychological malfeasance. 'I can go straight for two or three years at a time,' he told me last week, 'but then this urge will come upon me.' </p> <p>His first victim was Paul Scofield, with whom he appeared in a John Osborne play during the 1960s. Scofield, missing his stop on a train home, had pulled the emergency cord and nonchalantly disembarked between stations. Burke wrote him a reprimand, which purported to come from Sergeant Blenkinsop of the Railway Police. In turn, Scofield tricked Burke with a letter signed by a deranged fellow actor who wanted Burke to introduce him to Scofield. Burke panicked, fled from the theatre, then received another letter upbraiding him; Scofield smirked when accused. </p> <p>Despite the occasional retaliation, Burke remains incorrigible and recently sent a spurious note to one of his colleagues in the Almeida's current production of Richard II. The subtly rancorous document was signed by a director with whom the actor had fought; nevertheless, he read it as a gesture of reconciliation. 'People will believe whatever they choose,' said Burke. How can he be criticised for deceiving others when they so earnestly deceive themselves? </p> <p>Frayn, heroically candid and beatifically forgiving, acknowledges the dread and desperate paranoia he felt when he realised he had been duped. For a while, the world became frighteningly unstable, like the society of his crazed farce, Noises Off. He asks himself in Celia's Secret whether we are all 'living in a universal virtual reality generator, whose name is David Burke'. </p> <p>In the book, Burke has a brief moment of self-doubt as his plots proliferate, requiring him to suborn accomplices. 'Was I turning into an Iago?' he asks. As it happens, W.H. Auden once wrote an essay which described Iago as a nihilistic practical joker, and Burke linked his research into human vulnerability with the 'infernal science' of the physicists who toy with the destruction of the universe in Copenhagen. The Evil One, as Auden calls him, sets out, as if putting electrons through their paces of vivisecting atoms, to prove that 'human beings do not act - they only behave'. </p> <p>Burke's ruddy face, whiskered like Father Christmas, is indomitably jolly. 'It's just my delayed adolescence,' he insisted. 'I was a solemn child, a swot. I only began to have fun in middle age - and I haven't caught up yet! What harm am I doing?' </p> <p>Harm, I suggested, to our shared faith that the signatories of letters actually exist; harm to the self-esteem of the individuals who, like Malvolio in Twelfth Night, are tempted, trapped and then left to ponder their credulity and vanity as others mock them. 'Some people need their self-esteem bringing down,' said Burke. 'These bloody intellectuals! It was Michael's intelligence that made him so easy to fool. Anyone less brilliant would have dismissed what I'd written as gibberish. But he found reasons for believing in those documents. He wanted to make sense of the world.' The joker, meanwhile, returns the world to its native state of nonsense, a random dance of atoms, and of blinding, colliding egos. </p> <p>'Of course,' Burke conceded, 'Michael was ashamed when he found out.' But had Burke himself felt no shame? He thought about it, probing a moral anaesthesia like Iago's. 'No,' he said, 'none at all.' With supreme self-possession, he even managed a spasm of comic outrage when he remembered how Matthew Marsh (who played Heisenberg in Copenhagen ) told Frayn about the hoax. 'Ah yes, I was betrayed by my fellow actor,' roared Burke. 'My Judas! Though I don't wish Matthew any ill...' </p> <p>The reference to Judas took me aback: here was the Evil One beseeching the same sympathy we extend to the ingenuous figure of Christ. Frayn pardoned him, Burke believes, because: 'He saw a way of capitalising on it by making the story into a book. And he was generous enough to want me to share in writing it. I've always collected plots for novels or plays, but never did anything with them. So it was as if Olivier had said to me, \"Would you like to play Iago to my Othello?\" ' I quietly drew Burke's attention to the role for which he had nominated himself. </p> <p>Oddly, Burke admitted to a remorse about his activity onstage, rather than the schemes concocted in the dressing-room. After the impersonation of Scofield to which he treated me, I suggested that actors are natural counterfeiters, who forge the identities of others for a living. </p> <p>'Yes, and perhaps all of us in the theatre should feel guiltier than we do. We take the misery and pain of other people, swagger about pretending to experience what they have suffered and get paid and applauded for doing so.' </p> <p>For John of Gaunt's distress at his son's banishment in Richard II, Burke drew on his memory of an accident in which his own son almost died. 'I sometimes wonder what would happen if all those ghosts could come back and see us mimicking them.' </p> <p>This reminded me of an occasion when Burke played a ghost. At the National Theatre in 1989, he was Daniel Day-Lewis's spectral father in Hamlet. One evening, Day-Lewis mistook the ghost for his own father and walked abruptly off the stage to have a nervous breakdown. Burke mentions the incident in Celia's Secret when describing how he devised the joke while listening every night to a long speech by Matthew Marsh. Actors, he believes, should maintain their sanity by remaining detached, rather than risk ing Day-Lewis's Stanislavskyan immersion. I asked him to tell me more. </p> <p>'As the ghost disappears I said, \"Farewell, farewell, remember me\", then when I looked back, Dan had gone. We found him backstage on the floor, sobbing his eyes out. They sent the audience out to the bars, rustled up Dan's understudy, Jeremy Northam, who hadn't looked at the text for six weeks, got him dressed and sent him on as Hamlet in front of 1,200 people in the Olivier! Dan never played it again.' </p> <p>'What,' I asked, 'if Day-Lewis had emerged beaming at the end of the show, clapped Jeremy Northam on the back and said to him, \"It was only a joke\"?' That, Burke admitted, accepting that there were limits to the joker's licence, would not have been funny. </p> <p>Finally, he consented to my type-casting. He mentioned that he had written his part of Celia's Secret at the Union Jack Club in Waterloo, where he holes up when he can't get home to Kent. 'Oh you know it?' he asked, then looked at me doubtfully. 'Of course, it's only open to members of Her Majesty's Forces.' I questioned him about his military record. 'I was in the Royal Artillery between 1953 and 1955,' he said. 'I'd like to tell you I was a Russian interpreter with a sideline in code-breaking, but they put me to work as a humble typist.' Iago, I pointed out, was also a military man, a humble subaltern, disgruntled when he was passed over for promotion. </p> <p>Practical jokes are warfare conducted by other, more devious means, and they target our putative friends, not our enemies. Burke's alias in Celia's Secret is simultaneously writing a novel with which she assails Frayn. 'It was a spoof of Enid Blyton, about a 16-year-old boy called Hans who makes world peace possible by discovering a formula to turn steel into rubber - you can't kill anyone with a rubber gun!' The fantasy sums up the jester's mixed motives: lethal aggression fortuitously forestalled, but only because the gun barrel loses its metallic stiffness. </p> <p>Burke's blue eyes blinked. 'Well, then,' he said, 'I suppose I am Iago. So what should be done with me?' </p> <p>'In the play, they haul him away to be tortured,' I replied. </p> <p>Burke, however, swept off to Shoreditch, chuckling, where that evening he would lose his son, apostrophise tormented England, expire in anguish and then, quickly recovering from John of Gaunt's death, eat a hearty dinner. </p> <p>\u0095 David Burke and Michael Frayn will be reading from Celia's Secret at the Almeida Theatre, London N1 (0207 359 4404) on 23 May at 6.15pm.

How can he be criticised for deceiving others when they so earnestly deceive themselves? Frayn, heroically candid and beatifically forgiving, acknowledges the dread and desperate paranoia he felt when he realised he had been duped. For a while, the world became frighteningly unstable, like the society of his crazed farce, Noises Off. He asks himself in Celia's Secret whether we are all 'living in a universal virtual reality generator, whose name is David Burke'. In the book, Burke has a brief moment of self-doubt as his plots proliferate, requiring him to suborn accomplices. 'Was I turning into an Iago?' he asks. As it happens, W.H. Auden once wrote an essay which described Iago as a nihilistic practical joker, and Burke linked his research into human vulnerability with the 'infernal science' of the physicists who toy with the destruction of the universe in Copenhagen. The Evil One, as Auden calls him, sets out, as if putting electrons through their paces of vivisecting atoms, to prove that 'human beings do not act - they only behave'. Burke's ruddy face, whiskered like Father Christmas, is indomitably jolly. 'It's just my delayed adolescence,' he insisted. 'I was a solemn child, a swot. I only began to have fun in middle age - and I haven't caught up yet! What harm am I doing?' Harm, I suggested, to our shared faith that the signatories of letters actually exist; harm to the self-esteem of the individuals who, like Malvolio in Twelfth Night, are tempted, trapped and then left to ponder their credulity and vanity as others mock them. 'Some people need their self-esteem bringing down,' said Burke. 'These bloody intellectuals! It was Michael's intelligence that made him so easy to fool. Anyone less brilliant would have dismissed what I'd written as gibberish. But he found reasons for believing in those documents. He wanted to make sense of the world.' The joker, meanwhile, returns the world to its native state of nonsense, a random dance of atoms, and of blinding, colliding egos. 'Of course,' Burke conceded, 'Michael was ashamed when he found out.' But had Burke himself felt no shame? He thought about it, probing a moral anaesthesia like Iago's. 'No,' he said, 'none at all.' With supreme self-possession, he even managed a spasm of comic outrage when he remembered how Matthew Marsh (who played Heisenberg in Copenhagen ) told Frayn about the hoax. 'Ah yes, I was betrayed by my fellow actor,' roared Burke. 'My Judas! Though I don't wish Matthew any ill...' The reference to Judas took me aback: here was the Evil One beseeching the same sympathy we extend to the ingenuous figure of Christ. Frayn pardoned him, Burke believes, because: 'He saw a way of capitalising on it by making the story into a book. And he was generous enough to want me to share in writing it. I've always collected plots for novels or plays, but never did anything with them. So it was as if Olivier had said to me, \"Would you like to play Iago to my Othello?\" ' I quietly drew Burke's attention to the role for which he had nominated himself. Oddly, Burke admitted to a remorse about his activity onstage, rather than the schemes concocted in the dressing-room. After the impersonation of Scofield to which he treated me, I suggested that actors are natural counterfeiters, who forge the identities of others for a living. 'Yes, and perhaps all of us in the theatre should feel guiltier than we do. We take the misery and pain of other people, swagger about pretending to experience what they have suffered and get paid and applauded for doing so.' For John of Gaunt's distress at his son's banishment in Richard II, Burke drew on his memory of an accident in which his own son almost died. 'I sometimes wonder what would happen if all those ghosts could come back and see us mimicking them.' This reminded me of an occasion when Burke played a ghost. At the National Theatre in 1989, he was Daniel Day-Lewis's spectral father in Hamlet. One evening, Day-Lewis mistook the ghost for his own father and walked abruptly off the stage to have a nervous breakdown. Burke mentions the incident in Celia's Secret when describing how he devised the joke while listening every night to a long speech by Matthew Marsh. Actors, he believes, should maintain their sanity by remaining detached, rather than risk ing Day-Lewis's Stanislavskyan immersion. I asked him to tell me more. 'As the ghost disappears I said, \"Farewell, farewell, remember me\", then when I looked back, Dan had gone. We found him backstage on the floor, sobbing his eyes out. They sent the audience out to the bars, rustled up Dan's understudy, Jeremy Northam, who hadn't looked at the text for six weeks, got him dressed and sent him on as Hamlet in front of 1,200 people in the Olivier! Dan never played it again.' 'What,' I asked, 'if Day-Lewis had emerged beaming at the end of the show, clapped Jeremy Northam on the back and said to him, \"It was only a joke\"?' That, Burke admitted, accepting that there were limits to the joker's licence, would not have been funny. Finally, he consented to my type-casting. He mentioned that he had written his part of Celia's Secret at the Union Jack Club in Waterloo, where he holes up when he can't get home to Kent. 'Oh you know it?' he asked, then looked at me doubtfully. 'Of course, it's only open to members of Her Majesty's Forces.' I questioned him about his military record. 'I was in the Royal Artillery between 1953 and 1955,' he said. 'I'd like to tell you I was a Russian interpreter with a sideline in code-breaking, but they put me to work as a humble typist.' Iago, I pointed out, was also a military man, a humble subaltern, disgruntled when he was passed over for promotion. Practical jokes are warfare conducted by other, more devious means, and they target our putative friends, not our enemies. Burke's alias in Celia's Secret is simultaneously writing a novel with which she assails Frayn. 'It was a spoof of Enid Blyton, about a 16-year-old boy called Hans who makes world peace possible by discovering a formula to turn steel into rubber - you can't kill anyone with a rubber gun!' The fantasy sums up the jester's mixed motives: lethal aggression fortuitously forestalled, but only because the gun barrel loses its metallic stiffness. Burke's blue eyes blinked. 'Well, then,' he said, 'I suppose I am Iago. So what should be done with me?' 'In the play, they haul him away to be tortured,' I replied. Burke, however, swept off to Shoreditch, chuckling, where that evening he would lose his son, apostrophise tormented England, expire in anguish and then, quickly recovering from John of Gaunt's death, eat a hearty dinner. \u0095 David Burke and Michael Frayn will be reading from Celia's Secret at the Almeida Theatre, London N1 (0207 359 4404) on 23 May at 6.15pm. Celia's Secret is published by Faber &amp; Faber, \u00a312.99.",

      "body": "<p>Ever since the birth of the teenager, any adult who has carved out a career by incorporating all the elements synonymous with an adolescent in-crowd - the spiky, irreverent activities that keep the grown-ups angry and aghast - has had a Bill Haley moment. Finally, Chris Evans has been confronted by his.</p> <p>For Haley it was the day when the nation's youth, having pulled seats from cinemas and danced in the aisles, turned up at the airport and backed away on discovering rock and roll was being branded by a paunchy man with a kiss curl who was heading for 40. Now a kooky, bespectacled redhead is no longer the image that Channel 4 wishes to push as a brand as it pursues that elusive younger audience. (These days, viewer years are as odd as dog years: 'teenager' speaks for a 16- to 25-year-old demographic). Research in a recent internal Channel 4 report confirms that real teenagers would rather watch Sky One than the shows C4 offers them. Hardly any teenagers claim to watch TFI Friday, and fewer viewers in their early twenties are tuning in. It's an odd development.</p> <p>According to Sky One's recently appointed general manager, David Bergg, the network is not pursuing an exclusively younger audience. He says Sky One's fan base is 'parents in their forties with three kids who spend all their time in a very expensive replica football kit. They've had multi-channel TV for a number of years... they go on holiday a lot and they read Nick Hornby'.</p> <p>These parents and infants may soon be the only audience left for TFI Friday. Channel Four, in the wake of its in-house research, appears to be intent on putting Evans out of our misery, by seemingly dropping the idea of any further series. But with a contract until the end of the year, it is believed to be destined to run its annual course of 40 programmes.</p> <p>Usually, TV bosses remove shows that fail to perform in ratings - curiously TFI pulls the same number of viewers (2.5 million) as it did two years ago - although it is beaten regularly by BBC2's reruns of The Simpsons. But it is something much more critical that Evans has lost - his appeal both to the empire builders at the channel and the ad men who need a niche. For C4, certain programmes perform a function even more important than entertaining the viewers - they help build the brand and help market the channel as a colourful, edgy, entertaining alternative that can stand out in a cluttered environment.</p> <p>TFI, at least in C4's eyes, was once the perfect hybrid. It merged the saucy, slapstick aspects that were the legacy of youth television with a frontman inspired by the Zoo TV format that caught the eye of an audience living out their twenties in the Nineties. The whole experience was controlled by a kooky spontaneity roadtested in hospital and regional radio. But no longer: Evans - far from being seen as an irreverent anti-establishment figure - is now a media baron who invites his celebrity mates on to the show for an over-familiar chat in the studio. It's not quite Hello! TV but it isn't a million miles removed, and it is certainly a world away from the kind of brash subversive programmes with which C4 made a name (and brand) for itself in the early and mid-Nineties. Hence the channel chiefs' concern.</p> <p>As a sign of this unease C4 and TFI have enlisted a 'fixer' to nurse the show into a state of remission before its inevitable demise. Step forward Seamus Cassidy - one of the longest-serving apparatchiks from the early days of C4, in his former role as head of comedy and entertainment. He is to be installed at the nerve centre of the Evans empire, Ginger Productions, for one day each week, reportedly due to his ability to keep the sovereign under control.</p> <p>Cassidy was behind the commissioning of both TFI Friday, and the series that helped Evans to escape from the shelter of Planet 24, where he had been cast as a sizeable celebrity on The Big Breakfast. The plaudits that rained down on that show - Don't Forget Your Toothbrush - transformed it into the stuff of legend. It was said to have not simply brought a younger audience to a postmodern entertainment format, but did so in the Saturday night slot that had all but been written off since Saturday Night Live went off air, and the first generation of alternative comedians crossed channels.</p> <p>In hindsight, much of the show's greater success, and Evans's windfall of cash, was down to the extent to which the programme was sold abroad. It was bought by many countries, who translated it to their mother tongue, and all but put a bouncy redhead with kooky glasses at the helm.</p> <p>We find its legacy in a series such as Something For The Weekend which, with a wild, wacky blonde in leathers to the fore, and an emphasis on pricks and prizes, endeavours to fuse the essence of Evans with the stunts and pseudo-shock tactics of C4's traditional Friday night fare: The Word, The Girlie Show. The fact that an Australian network has recently bought the Weekend format, with other countries giving approving nods, suggests that we could be in for another lengthy haul.</p> <p>The truth is, TFI Friday has never done what it said on the tin. Channel Four appears to have prolonged its life as though it was part of its cache of programmes made to keep the network in the columns of the Daily Mail. How's that for blind ambition? Not that Evans hasn't tried. In the past, when the going got tough, he simply stripped naked or incorporated elements of other entertainment shows to which his oeuvre was once touted as an antidote. It was as though Tarrant and Edmonds were in the house.</p> <p>Controversy did however arrive, in the shape of a knuckle-rapping from the ITC, for making a child guest cry. From the outset, the show was doomed to become the TV equivalent of Oasis: it came up on the outside, but ultimately, became the centre of the worst case of excessive celebrity camaraderie. It was Chris and his friends: Gazza, Sporty Spice, Robbie, Kathy Burke, and the cast of any male-dominated British film. Valerie Solanas - she who shot Andy Warhol - once said that men had the opposite of the Midas Touch: everything they touch turns to shit. The same could be said of the credibility of every guest who sets foot on TFI Friday. Even the magnificence of Babybird, whose distinctive lo-fi, DIY pop was the antithesis of Evans's mainstream musical mates, seems to have been dulled by association with the show.</p> <p>Credibility is the key to the reason that C4 no longer needs Evans as a main brand. This is why Ali G and Richard Blackwood have been warmed up in the wings, and exposed at every opportunity, until familiarity's first mate - contempt - is almost at the door. Its pursuit of credibility brings to mind that of Abbey National launching an account called Cahoots to make young investors feel they are part of their own club. Currently, the channel remembers the days of The Word fondly, and is eager to capture the audience that helped put it on the map. But the programme, like The Girlie Show was the last word, rather than the first, in what was previously termed 'youth' television.</p> <p>It began in earnest with the professional ineptitude of the presenters and camera angles of Network 7. But like 'alternative' and 'gay', 'youth' became the word that anyone worth their salt moved away from because of the media figures who had come to symbolise it. The central presenters of The Word were essentially the kind that could have previously presented Why Don't You...?, with the right wardrobe and vocabulary grafted onto them.</p> <p>The origin of the species of what later metamorphosed into youth television was a genuinely more credible animal. It's ironic that Danny Baker should now be a provider of stunts and jokes to TFI Friday, as he was one of the first, and best practitioners of the craft in the post-punk period of the Seventies. In the series he worked with Janet Street Porter on The London Weekend Show and 20th Century Box - two programmes in which the trends cited within the content emerged from a sub-culture of which the show's presenters were a part.</p> <p>The nation's youth may have moved on - grown up, perhaps, even though many of those pursuing their interests are left looking in the same old places. It's not surprising that the nation's youth are now, more than any generation before, obsessed with pension plans, shares, and insurance. (Instead of forming bands, they take out bonds.) After all, look what has been done in their name by TV executives who assume that youth and infantilism are one and the same.</p> <p>It is not simply that C4 is looking in the same places for subjects for youth programmes - it is also looking at the same faces to make them.

Meanwhile, whistle-blowing dentists continue to reveal details of the profession's systematic defrauding of the National Health Service.</p> <p>Lord Hunt, the Minister responsible for dentists, has promised to introduce a system whereby dentists would audit each other's work and to bring the profession under closer scrutiny. He said: 'I am concerned about the variations in the quality of work.' Poor performers would have to be retrained, he said, and regional health authorities, which currently largely ignore dentists, would be responsible for monitoring them closely. The full reforms will be announced in July.</p> <p>In a passionate plea to clean up the profession, one dentist wrote to The Observer, claiming that most of his colleagues were boosting their earnings by making false claims for NHS payments: 'I estimate that 10 per cent of the profession are blatantly fraudulent, with another 15 per cent working in the \"grey areas\". Add to that a further 30 per cent who are chancing it occasionally, and you have a majority of the profession who are committing some degree of fraud.'</p> <p>Frauds include overcharging patients, claiming fees for work that wasn't done, and doing cheap treatments but claiming fees for expensive ones. The dentist concluded: 'Sadly, dentistry is a very dirty/shady profession, in dire need of exposure.

      "bodyText": "The government is to act against cowboy dentists, following The Observer 's revelations that \u00a3200 million worth of unnecessary work is carried out each year and 90 per cent of all dentistry is substandard. Meanwhile, whistle-blowing dentists continue to reveal details of the profession's systematic defrauding of the National Health Service. Lord Hunt, the Minister responsible for dentists, has promised to introduce a system whereby dentists would audit each other's work and to bring the profession under closer scrutiny. He said: 'I am concerned about the variations in the quality of work.' Poor performers would have to be retrained, he said, and regional health authorities, which currently largely ignore dentists, would be responsible for monitoring them closely. The full reforms will be announced in July. In a passionate plea to clean up the profession, one dentist wrote to The Observer, claiming that most of his colleagues were boosting their earnings by making false claims for NHS payments: 'I estimate that 10 per cent of the profession are blatantly fraudulent, with another 15 per cent working in the \"grey areas\". Add to that a further 30 per cent who are chancing it occasionally, and you have a majority of the profession who are committing some degree of fraud.' Frauds include overcharging patients, claiming fees for work that wasn't done, and doing cheap treatments but claiming fees for expensive ones. The dentist concluded: 'Sadly, dentistry is a very dirty/shady profession, in dire need of exposure. There are many deeply caring and hard-working dentists out there who are being let down by the cowboys ... it is a profession that is slowly sliding into the mire.' Another dentist, from the north of England, admitted: 'NHS dentists virtually can't work without fraud. People are forced into fraud because the fees are so low. It is very widespread. For the older ones, it is just how they work the system.' The dentists detailed dozens of scams that are widespread in the profession, of which the most straightforward include: * Charging full private fees for work, and then also claiming payment on the NHS. * Charging the patient the NHS fee, but then claiming the patient is on benefits and entitled to free treatment, and recouping the full amount from the Government. * Fitting a non-precious alloy crown, but claiming fees for an expensive precious metal one. 'It's a very safe form of fraudulent claim because you can only prove it by removing the work from the patient and analysing it,' said one dentist. * Claiming fees for repairing braces, work which it is impossible to prove whether or not it has been done. 'Most practitioners will claim these fees on a regular basis to boost fee income, because they are never checked.' * Dentists - who are entitled to claim a one-off \u00a350 fee for opening over the weekend - line up many patients back to back on Saturday and claim the fee for each one.

So Tomaselli was understandably miffed last week when the town council, in a drive to clean up the resort's image and rid the Riviera of its more unsightly excrescences, ordered him to pull down the summer restaurant he has run on Pampelonne beach since 1968. La Voile Rouge, whose guests have included Jane Fonda, Robert De Niro, Sylvester Stallone, George Michael, Mick Jagger, Liza Minnelli, Charles Aznavour and - inevitably - the Spice Girls, was built in defiance of planning regulations but has long been tolerated as one of Saint-Trop's biggest draws. But, after numerous complaints from local residents about the decibel level of the restaurant's music and the incessant roar of helicopters bringing in new arrivals from Nice airport, the council has ruled that La Voile Rouge be bulldozed to the ground. 'Why me?' asked Tomaselli, pointing out the 32 other illegal bars and eateries lining the beach. 'I'm one of the originals, one of the glories of the place.' Tomaselli, who calls La Voile Rouge 'a genuine experiment in sexual and surreal philosophy', also enjoys fame as the man who launched the fashion for bare breasts on the Riviera by allowing his women customers to go topless. With the help of French celebrities, including rocker Johnny Hallyday, he has promised to fight the council's decision through the courts, beginning with an appeal on a technicality. The ruling of Saint-Tropez's planning committee, he claims, is illegal because it was elected by simple majority and not, as the rules stipulate, by proportional representation. Although the village that the writer Guy de Maupassant described as 'a charming, simple daughter of the sea' first hit the headlines in 1956 with Bardot's breakthrough appearance in And God Created Woman, its charms were discovered in the late nineteenth century. Artists and writers were drawn by the peninsula's spectacular light and the resort rapidly became popular.

Now he was about to become one of Tom Wolfe's 'Masters of the Universe'.</p> <p>At that meeting on 6 May last year, Keefe, Bruyette and Woods was due to announce a public offering of 4.7 million shares which would raise $85m, with a personal stake of $20m for McDermott, but he had something confess: he had passed on trading information to a 'friend' now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He told colleagues only that the connection was 'personal'.</p> <p>The 'friend' was his lover and confidante, Kathryn Gannon, or Marilyn Star, a porn queen with her own live-action website and a string of XXX-rated films, including Cirque du Sex and Strap up Sally. Before her tryst with McDermott, Star's marketing experience had been limited to her talents and a range of sex toys. Her films even feature fans who pay $800 to star in a scene with her.</p> <p>With her director and camera crew, she tours restau rants and bars inquiring: 'Hey baby, you wanna get laid?' Star, McDermott's lover, was the lucky recipient of lucrative insider information on coming mergers and deals on Keefe, Bruyette's confidential 'watch list'.</p> <p>After McDermott's revelation, the board adjourned and Keefe, Bruyette's public issue was cancelled. Three days later McDermott was invited to resign. For months, the decision remained a mystery, the firm successfully encouraging rumours it had pulled back from the brink because it was itself subject to takeover. It has taken a full year for the details to leak out from the World Trade Centre.</p> <p>McDermott's destruction was complete last week when he became the first CEO on Wall Street to be convicted of insider trading. The reputations of he and his firm are in ruins. To complete his humiliation, the lover whom Marilyn Star had kept in tandem with McDermott - Anthony Pomponio - was convicted with him. Star passed information from McDermott to Pomponio, a New Jersey businessman she met at a porn fair.</p> <p>Star is a fugitive in her native Canada, promising to resist extradition. She is shacked up at the Vancouver villa of her latest squeeze, her 'financier' Michael Gilley.</p> <p>McDermott's life was built on the spree of banking mergers in the Nineties. From his office he returned home each night to an expansive mock-Tudor home.

      "bodyText": "When chief executive officer James McDermott walked into the boardroom of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods for the most important meeting in the firm's history, he was a titan on Wall Street with an imperial view from the 85th floor of the World Trade Centre. A rags-to-riches banker, McDermott was the prominent public face of high finance, a prodigy chief executive and television pundit on an annual salary of $4.4 million. Now he was about to become one of Tom Wolfe's 'Masters of the Universe'. At that meeting on 6 May last year, Keefe, Bruyette and Woods was due to announce a public offering of 4.7 million shares which would raise $85m, with a personal stake of $20m for McDermott, but he had something confess: he had passed on trading information to a 'friend' now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He told colleagues only that the connection was 'personal'. The 'friend' was his lover and confidante, Kathryn Gannon, or Marilyn Star, a porn queen with her own live-action website and a string of XXX-rated films, including Cirque du Sex and Strap up Sally. Before her tryst with McDermott, Star's marketing experience had been limited to her talents and a range of sex toys. Her films even feature fans who pay $800 to star in a scene with her. With her director and camera crew, she tours restau rants and bars inquiring: 'Hey baby, you wanna get laid?' Star, McDermott's lover, was the lucky recipient of lucrative insider information on coming mergers and deals on Keefe, Bruyette's confidential 'watch list'. After McDermott's revelation, the board adjourned and Keefe, Bruyette's public issue was cancelled. Three days later McDermott was invited to resign. For months, the decision remained a mystery, the firm successfully encouraging rumours it had pulled back from the brink because it was itself subject to takeover. It has taken a full year for the details to leak out from the World Trade Centre. McDermott's destruction was complete last week when he became the first CEO on Wall Street to be convicted of insider trading. The reputations of he and his firm are in ruins. To complete his humiliation, the lover whom Marilyn Star had kept in tandem with McDermott - Anthony Pomponio - was convicted with him. Star passed information from McDermott to Pomponio, a New Jersey businessman she met at a porn fair. Star is a fugitive in her native Canada, promising to resist extradition. She is shacked up at the Vancouver villa of her latest squeeze, her 'financier' Michael Gilley. McDermott's life was built on the spree of banking mergers in the Nineties. From his office he returned home each night to an expansive mock-Tudor home. Waiting for him in the exclusive gated community of Braircliffe Manor were his wife, Darian, and his two teenage daughters. He seemed infallible.

      "body": "<p>At the far end of a military airport in Colombo, a Hercules aircraft sits in a hangar. Unfortunately for Sri Lanka's marooned army in the north, it does not work. Over the past two and a half weeks, as rebel Tamil Tigers advanced across the Jaffna peninsula, engineers were pondering how to fix the plane's broken exhaust duct.</p> <p>In the unlikely event that the Hercules is mended, Sri Lanka's panicky military establishment faces another problem: it has no pilots capable of flying it. A second Hercules ordered from Britain as part of a \u00a312 million deal has yet to arrive. Some 16 flights a day continue to supply the cut-off town of Jaffna, but the pilots who fly the leased Antonovs are Ukranian.</p> <p>It is against this background of bungling and delay in provision of vital aircraft and weaponry, that the Sri Lankan government appears to be losing its 17-year-war against the Tamil Tigers.</p> <p>Since 22 April, the Tigers have used devastating heavy artillery fire to push deep into the Jaffna peninsula, capturing a key military base at Elephant Pass and advancing to within 23 miles of Jaffna, their capital until 1995. The government yesterday claimed it had driven rebel soldiers from the naval base of Kilaly; the Tigers say they are still there.</p> <p>Although government troops are not beaten yet, it seems a matter of time before Jaffna falls, in what would be Sri Lanka's answer to Saigon.</p> <p>According to the few aid workers remaining in Jaffna, the mood there is tense. The latest Tiger offensive has driven 10,000 refugees into the town. 'They fled completely on advice. There was some notification that villages were going to be targeted. They had time to prepare things,' one aid worker said. 'They are camping out in schools and temples and places like that. We are providing them with plastic sheeting, bedding and clothing. There is a tremendous amount of anxiety. The shelling is pretty constant. It is going on all the time.'</p> <p>The government insists life continues as normal, with schools and offices still open.</p> <p>'There is no fighting in Jaffna yet. What worries us is how things will evolve,' another aid worker said.</p> <p>All radio links to Jaffna were severed last week, when soldiers fleeing Elephant Pass blew up a transmitter. With the town cut off by advancing rebels, the only way in and out is via the military airbase at Palali, on the northern peninsula.</p> <p>The Tigers need to advance only five more kilometres before the base's runway comes in range of their heavy artillery. This would force the military to evacuate. 'The situation is very worrying,' Isabelle Barras of the International Red Cross said yesterday. Some 45 UN personnel left yesterday by Red Cross boat, but other aid agencies are staying put.</p> <p>Officially, Sri Lanka's government, headed by President Chandrika Kumaratunga, has ruled out any possibility of evacuating the 28,000 troops stuck in Jaffna. 'There is absolutely no truth in these reports,' army chief of staff Major General Lionel Balagalle declared yesterday. Instead, the President has embarked on an urgent quest for diplomatic support and fresh military hardware.</p> <p>Several new Israeli jet fighters are expected to arrive in Colombo shortly, following Sri Lanka's resumption of diplomatic relations with Israel last week. Whether the jets are enough to turn the war around remains to be seen. 'In the worst-case scenario we will have to evacuate temporarily,' one senior government official admitted. 'You can't sacrifice 28,000 lives. But I don't think it is going to happen.'</p> <p>Military analysts say any evacuation would be difficult. The Sri Lankan military is believed to have more than a dozen Israeli naval gunships. But it has no large frigates which could transport thousands of soldiers, diplomatic sources suggest. India last week ruled out assistance, following its disastrous intervention in the war between 1987-1990, though it may yet send a task force to rescue some of Jaffna's 500,000-strong civilian Tamil population.</p> <p>But any sea operation is fraught with danger. The Tigers' enigmatic leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, who operates from a secret base near Mullaittivu on Sri Lanka's north-east coast, has virtual domination of all major sea routes.</p> <p>Soldiers on the front line near Kilaly, meanwhile, continue to die. 'The problem is that the Tigers, whenever they attack, do so with massive firepower,' one analyst said. 'The soldiers are caught hiding behind pathetic bunker lines. The Tigers advance with the kind of textbook strategies used by European armies.'</p> <p>Kumaratunga's other response to the crisis has been an Orwellian public order act. Sweeping censorship has been imposed. The President has new powers to ban public meetings, seize printing presses, and close down newspapers. All journalists must submit stories to a military censor. Journalists have long been forbidden from visiting the battle zone. But the latest edicts mean Sri Lanka's 17-year-old war is now almost unreportable.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At the far end of a military airport in Colombo, a Hercules aircraft sits in a hangar. Unfortunately for Sri Lanka's marooned army in the north, it does not work. Over the past two and a half weeks, as rebel Tamil Tigers advanced across the Jaffna peninsula, engineers were pondering how to fix the plane's broken exhaust duct. In the unlikely event that the Hercules is mended, Sri Lanka's panicky military establishment faces another problem: it has no pilots capable of flying it. A second Hercules ordered from Britain as part of a \u00a312 million deal has yet to arrive. Some 16 flights a day continue to supply the cut-off town of Jaffna, but the pilots who fly the leased Antonovs are Ukranian. It is against this background of bungling and delay in provision of vital aircraft and weaponry, that the Sri Lankan government appears to be losing its 17-year-war against the Tamil Tigers. Since 22 April, the Tigers have used devastating heavy artillery fire to push deep into the Jaffna peninsula, capturing a key military base at Elephant Pass and advancing to within 23 miles of Jaffna, their capital until 1995. The government yesterday claimed it had driven rebel soldiers from the naval base of Kilaly; the Tigers say they are still there. Although government troops are not beaten yet, it seems a matter of time before Jaffna falls, in what would be Sri Lanka's answer to Saigon. According to the few aid workers remaining in Jaffna, the mood there is tense. The latest Tiger offensive has driven 10,000 refugees into the town. 'They fled completely on advice. There was some notification that villages were going to be targeted. They had time to prepare things,' one aid worker said. 'They are camping out in schools and temples and places like that. We are providing them with plastic sheeting, bedding and clothing. There is a tremendous amount of anxiety. The shelling is pretty constant. It is going on all the time.' The government insists life continues as normal, with schools and offices still open. 'There is no fighting in Jaffna yet. What worries us is how things will evolve,' another aid worker said. All radio links to Jaffna were severed last week, when soldiers fleeing Elephant Pass blew up a transmitter. With the town cut off by advancing rebels, the only way in and out is via the military airbase at Palali, on the northern peninsula. The Tigers need to advance only five more kilometres before the base's runway comes in range of their heavy artillery. This would force the military to evacuate. 'The situation is very worrying,' Isabelle Barras of the International Red Cross said yesterday. Some 45 UN personnel left yesterday by Red Cross boat, but other aid agencies are staying put. Officially, Sri Lanka's government, headed by President Chandrika Kumaratunga, has ruled out any possibility of evacuating the 28,000 troops stuck in Jaffna. 'There is absolutely no truth in these reports,' army chief of staff Major General Lionel Balagalle declared yesterday. Instead, the President has embarked on an urgent quest for diplomatic support and fresh military hardware. Several new Israeli jet fighters are expected to arrive in Colombo shortly, following Sri Lanka's resumption of diplomatic relations with Israel last week. Whether the jets are enough to turn the war around remains to be seen. 'In the worst-case scenario we will have to evacuate temporarily,' one senior government official admitted. 'You can't sacrifice 28,000 lives. But I don't think it is going to happen.' Military analysts say any evacuation would be difficult. The Sri Lankan military is believed to have more than a dozen Israeli naval gunships. But it has no large frigates which could transport thousands of soldiers, diplomatic sources suggest. India last week ruled out assistance, following its disastrous intervention in the war between 1987-1990, though it may yet send a task force to rescue some of Jaffna's 500,000-strong civilian Tamil population. But any sea operation is fraught with danger. The Tigers' enigmatic leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, who operates from a secret base near Mullaittivu on Sri Lanka's north-east coast, has virtual domination of all major sea routes. Soldiers on the front line near Kilaly, meanwhile, continue to die. 'The problem is that the Tigers, whenever they attack, do so with massive firepower,' one analyst said. 'The soldiers are caught hiding behind pathetic bunker lines. The Tigers advance with the kind of textbook strategies used by European armies.' Kumaratunga's other response to the crisis has been an Orwellian public order act. Sweeping censorship has been imposed. The President has new powers to ban public meetings, seize printing presses, and close down newspapers. All journalists must submit stories to a military censor. Journalists have long been forbidden from visiting the battle zone. But the latest edicts mean Sri Lanka's 17-year-old war is now almost unreportable.",

All we are asking is equal treatment so people can decide freely whether they stay in SPLA areas or go to the government. But the government has the upper hand and the UN system is keeping silent.'</p> <p>The Nuba are now in their thirteenth year of struggle for a democratic, secular state in which the country's African south would be the equal of its Arab north. Since the fundamentalist generals of the National Islamic Front came to power in 1989, an attempt to defeat the Nuba rebellion has grown into a scorched-earth holy war of annihilation against a people whose tradition of political and religious tolerance threatens the Front's whole project of a conformist Islamic extremism.</p> <p>Today, hundreds of thousands of Nuba starved out of the mountains are imprisoned in 'peace villages' where men are armed and compelled to fight against fellow Nuba; where children are separated from their parents and conscripted into Islamic militias; where women are raped to dilute Nuba ethnicity.</p> <p>Nuba who refuse to leave SPLA-controlled areas are being driven off the fertile plains and into the mountains where survival is a daily struggle. Even the UN acknowledges that women venturing down to the government-controlled plains to fetch water and mangoes are subjected to rape 'often of the most horrendous kind'.</p> <p>As evidence of human rights abuses piles up, the government promises relief but fights with the oldest, and cruellest, weapon in its arsenal - hunger.</p> <p>Rahila Kuku, a mother of five, was put to work gathering in the sorghum that was thick in the fields surrounding Tabanyaat the time of the attack on the village on 17 March. She says hundreds of prisoners, working at gunpoint, stripped the sorghum fields bare and loaded every grain on to trucks bound for government garrisons in other parts of the mountains.</p> <p>Rahila escaped to Kadoro after being raped repeatedly over a month, but at the hospital has found only words of comfort - not the painkillers she wants. She says her body still hurts from the beatings she received and her breasts are sore. She suspects she is pregnant. If she is, she says, she will not harm the child. 'It's not his fault.'</p> <p>Phoebe Tutu fled to Kadoro with nine children and a jerrycan when the first government troops attacked Tabanya at 4am. Forced off Kadoro mountain by hunger a little more than a week ago, she joined a group of 30 women foraging for food on the edge of government-controlled areas a four-hour walk away. The women were ambushed and four died. Phoebe was shot and wounded. Reduced to one small plate of sorghum a day, all her children are suffering from diarrhoea.</p> <p>The government's capture of Toro airstrip near Tabanya has put the displaced almost beyond the reach of help. The nearest airstrip is now 75miles away - a three-day trek up granite mountains and down valleys where water holes are drying up and government troops lay ambushes for defenceless civilians.</p> <p>On Easter Sunday, as the UN continued to turn a blind eye to the disaster unfolding around Tabanya five weeks after its fall, the first planeload of 4.3 tons of relief organised by the British charity Christian Aid touched down at an airstrip in the east of the mountains. It was the start of a 10-day round trip that required five camels, 250 porters and an armed guard of almost 100 men to be brought to a successful conclusion.</p> <p>'At one stroke, the attack on Tabanya has cut people off from their harvest and also from easy access from outside,' said Christian Aid's Paul Savage. 'It now takes a huge logistical effort across insecure and dangerous areas to bring the smallest amount of help to the displaced. This is a planned and purposeful undermining of the Nuba's resilience and capacity to cope and exist.'</p> <p>The toughest and most dangerous, part of the journey was the first leg - a 10-hour, all-night walk across a valley disputed by the government and the SPLA. Scouts preceded us and flanked us and in the middle of the night ordered a sudden change of route. Without warning, we left the rough track we had been following and took to the bush - looping northwards between thorn bushes and sweet-smelling acacia trees until we encountered a second, parallel track shortly before dawn.</p> <p>Back in the safety of the mountains by the time the sun rose, we learnt that one of our radio messages had been intercepted and an ambush prepared for us by soldiers who the previous week had captured, and raped, two Nuba women.</p> <p>The same soldiers climbed that same mountain the following week, under cover of darkness, and killed a Nuba farmer as he slept - the twenty-fourth civilian killed in random hit-and-run raids in the past month, according to Daoud Siddiq, head of a Nuba human rights team working in SPLA-controlled areas.</p> <p>The second leg of our journey skirted the foothills of the Achiron mountains where government soldiers had kidnapped and then killed the headmaster of a local school a few weeks earlier. Shortly before reaching Dabker, the largest market in the region, our path was obliterated by a chain of bomb craters. The local SPLA commander, Ibrahim Mulfa, said government bombers went into action on 15 April exactly two hours after a UN team flew out of the mountains at the end of a campaign of polio vaccinations.</p> <p>'No one was hurt,' he said, 'but a pig went down into one of the craters and died. We believe the government is using chemical weapons.'</p> <p>SPLA officials have been obsessed with the idea of chemical weapons ever since President Clinton ordered the bombing of the al-Shifa factory in Khartoum in 1998, claiming it was part of a government chemical weapons programme. Nuba civilians know better. It is they who are being attacked, not the SPLA.</p> <p>Zakariah Suleiman, an elderly farmer, was among those captured in the Tabanya offensive. For three days he was forced to work for the government forces.</p> <p>'They burned all the far sorghum and collected all the near sorghum,' he said. 'They sent us out every day in large groups protected by soldiers. This is their weapon against us: hunger. They have taken everything from Tabanya - sorghum, beans, cowpeas and maize. Nothing is left.'</p> <p>Like Rahila Kuku, Suleiman succeeded in escaping from Tabanya and fled to Kadoro - fully aware that he was running from hunger to hunger.</p> <p>'I'm happy to be here whether I find food or not,' he said. 'I have left everything behind, but I don't care if I'm naked or clothed. Here I can go wherever I want to without asking for permission. It's not like over there, in Tabanya, where you are kept under guard and have to ask for permission even to urinate. I may die of hunger here, but I'll die free - not penned in like an animal.'</p>",

The UN's silence has been almost as shocking to the Nuba as the attack on Tabanya that displaced 15,000 people and propelled them towards Kadoro - a mountain village of 150 families that has shared its own meagre supplies for more than a month and now has nothing more to offer. 'The UN's own first mission to the mountains was heavily shelled - but it has never said a word of criticism of the government,' said Walid Hamed, assistant to rebel commander Yusuf Kuwa. 'When it comes to the government, the UN is on its knees. All we are asking is equal treatment so people can decide freely whether they stay in SPLA areas or go to the government. But the government has the upper hand and the UN system is keeping silent.' The Nuba are now in their thirteenth year of struggle for a democratic, secular state in which the country's African south would be the equal of its Arab north. Since the fundamentalist generals of the National Islamic Front came to power in 1989, an attempt to defeat the Nuba rebellion has grown into a scorched-earth holy war of annihilation against a people whose tradition of political and religious tolerance threatens the Front's whole project of a conformist Islamic extremism. Today, hundreds of thousands of Nuba starved out of the mountains are imprisoned in 'peace villages' where men are armed and compelled to fight against fellow Nuba; where children are separated from their parents and conscripted into Islamic militias; where women are raped to dilute Nuba ethnicity. Nuba who refuse to leave SPLA-controlled areas are being driven off the fertile plains and into the mountains where survival is a daily struggle. Even the UN acknowledges that women venturing down to the government-controlled plains to fetch water and mangoes are subjected to rape 'often of the most horrendous kind'. As evidence of human rights abuses piles up, the government promises relief but fights with the oldest, and cruellest, weapon in its arsenal - hunger. Rahila Kuku, a mother of five, was put to work gathering in the sorghum that was thick in the fields surrounding Tabanyaat the time of the attack on the village on 17 March. She says hundreds of prisoners, working at gunpoint, stripped the sorghum fields bare and loaded every grain on to trucks bound for government garrisons in other parts of the mountains. Rahila escaped to Kadoro after being raped repeatedly over a month, but at the hospital has found only words of comfort - not the painkillers she wants. She says her body still hurts from the beatings she received and her breasts are sore. She suspects she is pregnant. If she is, she says, she will not harm the child. 'It's not his fault.' Phoebe Tutu fled to Kadoro with nine children and a jerrycan when the first government troops attacked Tabanya at 4am. Forced off Kadoro mountain by hunger a little more than a week ago, she joined a group of 30 women foraging for food on the edge of government-controlled areas a four-hour walk away. The women were ambushed and four died. Phoebe was shot and wounded. Reduced to one small plate of sorghum a day, all her children are suffering from diarrhoea. The government's capture of Toro airstrip near Tabanya has put the displaced almost beyond the reach of help. The nearest airstrip is now 75miles away - a three-day trek up granite mountains and down valleys where water holes are drying up and government troops lay ambushes for defenceless civilians. On Easter Sunday, as the UN continued to turn a blind eye to the disaster unfolding around Tabanya five weeks after its fall, the first planeload of 4.3 tons of relief organised by the British charity Christian Aid touched down at an airstrip in the east of the mountains. It was the start of a 10-day round trip that required five camels, 250 porters and an armed guard of almost 100 men to be brought to a successful conclusion. 'At one stroke, the attack on Tabanya has cut people off from their harvest and also from easy access from outside,' said Christian Aid's Paul Savage. 'It now takes a huge logistical effort across insecure and dangerous areas to bring the smallest amount of help to the displaced. This is a planned and purposeful undermining of the Nuba's resilience and capacity to cope and exist.' The toughest and most dangerous, part of the journey was the first leg - a 10-hour, all-night walk across a valley disputed by the government and the SPLA. Scouts preceded us and flanked us and in the middle of the night ordered a sudden change of route. Without warning, we left the rough track we had been following and took to the bush - looping northwards between thorn bushes and sweet-smelling acacia trees until we encountered a second, parallel track shortly before dawn. Back in the safety of the mountains by the time the sun rose, we learnt that one of our radio messages had been intercepted and an ambush prepared for us by soldiers who the previous week had captured, and raped, two Nuba women. The same soldiers climbed that same mountain the following week, under cover of darkness, and killed a Nuba farmer as he slept - the twenty-fourth civilian killed in random hit-and-run raids in the past month, according to Daoud Siddiq, head of a Nuba human rights team working in SPLA-controlled areas. The second leg of our journey skirted the foothills of the Achiron mountains where government soldiers had kidnapped and then killed the headmaster of a local school a few weeks earlier. Shortly before reaching Dabker, the largest market in the region, our path was obliterated by a chain of bomb craters. The local SPLA commander, Ibrahim Mulfa, said government bombers went into action on 15 April exactly two hours after a UN team flew out of the mountains at the end of a campaign of polio vaccinations. 'No one was hurt,' he said, 'but a pig went down into one of the craters and died. We believe the government is using chemical weapons.' SPLA officials have been obsessed with the idea of chemical weapons ever since President Clinton ordered the bombing of the al-Shifa factory in Khartoum in 1998, claiming it was part of a government chemical weapons programme. Nuba civilians know better. It is they who are being attacked, not the SPLA. Zakariah Suleiman, an elderly farmer, was among those captured in the Tabanya offensive. For three days he was forced to work for the government forces. 'They burned all the far sorghum and collected all the near sorghum,' he said. 'They sent us out every day in large groups protected by soldiers. This is their weapon against us: hunger. They have taken everything from Tabanya - sorghum, beans, cowpeas and maize. Nothing is left.' Like Rahila Kuku, Suleiman succeeded in escaping from Tabanya and fled to Kadoro - fully aware that he was running from hunger to hunger. 'I'm happy to be here whether I find food or not,' he said. 'I have left everything behind, but I don't care if I'm naked or clothed. Here I can go wherever I want to without asking for permission. It's not like over there, in Tabanya, where you are kept under guard and have to ask for permission even to urinate. I may die of hunger here, but I'll die free - not penned in like an animal.'",

      "body": "<b> A is for Apocalypse</b>, this autumn's prematurely-hyped exhibition at the Royal Academy which promises to refuel the Daily Mail outrage that met its predecessor, the 'epoch-making' Sensation exhibition. Apocalypse will feature a life-size figure of the Pope having been struck by a meteorite, and photographs by Wolfgang Tillman who is famous for depicting his lover masturbating. The show is not, according to its curator Norman Rosenthal, about 'shocking people'. 'But it is,' he explains helpfully, 'about shock.' Rosenthal plans to mount a similar show annually. He does not say what he will call the event that comes after Apocalypse. <p> <b>B is for Bowie</b>, chameleon-like rock guru, whose current incarnation sees him as a major collector of contemporary art, proprietor of the journal Modern Painters, dauber of neo-Cubist paintings and designer of wallpaper for Laura Ashley. Though less respectful artists accuse of him of being a dabbler, Bowie is beaten only by Madonna as a celebrity spot at gallery openings. B is also for <b> Joseph Beuys</b>, the late German artist famous for empty coat-hangers, and for the phrase 'x is the new Beuys', routinely applied to all artists fresh out of Goldsmith's College. </p> <p> <b> C is for the writer and TV presenter Matthew Collings</b>, the mutton-chopped, monosyllabic chronicler of the mini-Renaissance in British art. It is also for the <b> Chapman Brothers</b>, Jake and Dinos, its enfants terribles. Collings trenchantly and typically describes the Chapmans' plastic sculptures of mutant young girls with dildoes for noses as 'seemingly very tied to the problems of real modern life'. And he keeps an ever so straight, slightly puzzled, face while he does so. </p> <p> <b> D is for Damien Hirst</b>, responsible for first putting British artists on tabloid front pages. At art school, when confronted with a blank canvas, Hirst posed one of the seminal questions of post-postmodern aesthetics: 'What do I do now,' he mused to himself, 'paint a fucking horse or a dog or something?' </p> <p> <b> E is for elephant dung</b>, lumps of which, when adhered to a painting of the Virgin Mary by Turner Prize winner Chris Ofili, got up the nose of New York's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani, a Catholic, apparently missed the witty observation on Ofili's cultural heritage that the excreta offered, and attempted instead to ban the Sensation show in which it figured. His actions brought such notable art radicals as the situationist Hugh Grant flocking to the opening in support of the seminal role of extravagant faeces in modern culture. </p> <p> <b> F is for formaldehyde</b>, medium of choice for contemporary artists plagued by the big questions: death and pickling. These haunted figures also have a hankering for all things stainless steel, especially old dentists' drills and their aunt's medicine cabinet, the contents of which are taken as mute reminders of mortality: Alka Seltzer thus becomes the modern momento mori; Elastoplast our Yorick's skull. </p> <p> <b> G is for Gilbert and George</b>, reluctant gay dads of the newer wave of British artists, the anal retentive Morecambe and Wise to the younger generation's more relaxed Vic and Bob. G is also for <b> Groucho Club</b>, where said relaxed artists torture themselves about what it all means, and allow their more inspired work to quietly gestate while they pick arcane fights with former agents. </p> <p> <b> H is for Hoxton</b>, the district of east London to which most of the above eventually stagger home. British artists enjoy a symbiotic relationship with British property developers: like the smell of freshly baked bread and recently ground coffee, their very presence in the vicinity of a derelict warehouse ups its asking price fivefold. Before long, to the delight of locals, there is a Starbucks on the corner and an organic deli in the basement. See also: Southwark, Bermondsey etc </p> <p> <b> I is for installation</b>, a useful catch-all term for what artists are up to when not at the Groucho Club. An installation can be an odd blue light, a nest of maggots or a fried egg, but such things can only become installations when they are married to a concept. The offspring of an installation and a concept is what we now understand as art. I is also for <b> irony</b>, without which many concepts would just be desperate ideas. </p> <p> <b> J is for gallery owner Jay Jopling</b>, the Eton-educated, Savile Row-suited son of a Tory peer, who personifies the seismic shift in the class attitudes brought about by the hotspurs of the new new thing. Through his gallery, White Cube, Jopling represents the likes of Tracey Emin and sculptor Antony (Angel of the North) Gormley. He is, his more unwashed clients are at pains to explain, such a deeply establishment figure that, when viewed in a certain light, he is radically anti-establishment. This fine distinction is only apparent to the carefully trained artistic eye. </p> <p> <b> K is for Anish Kapoor</b>, Bombay-born artist famed as an explorer of 'negative space'. It is also for <b> Jeff Koons</b>, sculptor of porcelain Michael Jacksons and ex-husband of porn star La Cicciolina. </p> <p> <b> L is for Lottery</b>, the serendipitous benefactor to the new golden age of galleries, including Tate Modern which opens to the public on Friday. The National Lottery is, of course, proof positive that most ordinary people in Britain are tireless in their support of contemporary visual art and are also more than happy to support the bar bills of its practitioners. L is also for <b> loft</b>, chosen abode of those who want to share in the new, wild artistic lifestyle: pension fund managers, perhaps, or auditors. </p> <p> <b> M is for Madonna</b>, without whose imprimatur no gallery extension would ever be taken remotely seriously. M is also for <b> Tate Modern</b>, of which Madonna is the unofficial mascot. The correct response to the question 'What's the new Tate like?' when posed by cultural historians and cab drivers is, of course: 'I don't know, but Madonna will be at the opening...' </p> <p> <b> N is for Bruce Nauman</b>, cowboy high priest of conceptualism, who early in his career made a memorable half-hour video of himself juggling with his testicles. Nauman now lives in New Mexico, where he whispers to horses and makes hellish carousels out of taxidermist's moulds. N is also for <b> nihilism</b>, <b> neo-conceptualism</b> and <b> nonsense</b>. </p> <p> <b> O is for opening</b>, the raison d'etre behind much of the best offerings in modern art. It is during the opening that new concepts are revealed for the first time, and their progenitors have a chance to explain them with full rigour to an ever-anxious public. Openings are generally sponsored by large corporations with a desire to seem non-corporate; Absolut vodka is mandatory. </p> <p> <b> P is for painting</b>, which no one can be bothered much with now, except iconoclasts such as Gary Hume, who does it in an ironic, conceptual kind of way, and Damien Hirst who has his assistants colour in dots on a canvas which he can sell for \u00a360,000. Hirst is apparently angry with British Airways who he believes have borrowed his coloured dots concept for their logo to promote the cheap and cheerful airline, Go. It's a terrible rip-off, he complains. </p> <p> <b> Q is for Quo Vadis</b>, a restaurant owned by Marco Pierre White and decorated at one time by Hirst. The artist's installations were removed by White after it was claimed they put diners off their food. Even so, the collaboration proved that art is now capable of invading every sacred corner of our cultural life, even the contemporary holy of holies: the designer kitchen. Q is also for <b> Marc Quinn</b>, an artist whose work, some suggest, provides a commentary on this cross-fertilisation between visual and alimentary art. (Quinn makes figurative heads out of blood: sculptural black puddings.) </p> <p> <b> R is for Norman Rosenthal</b>, the P.T. Barnum of the Royal Academy, and the man responsible for Sensation and, now, Apocalypse. In between times Rosenthal has also put together the Monet in the 20th Century exhibition, which was modern at least in the amount of money it took and the T-shirts it shifted. R is also for <b> rock and roll</b>, as in 'Britart is the new...' or 'Monet is the new...'? </p> <p> <b> S is for Nick Serota</b>, the saintly driving force behind Tate Modern which promises to do for London roughly what the Guggenheim did for Bilbao, only more so - bring in planeloads of American tourists.

      "bodyText": "A is for Apocalypse, this autumn's prematurely-hyped exhibition at the Royal Academy which promises to refuel the Daily Mail outrage that met its predecessor, the 'epoch-making' Sensation exhibition. Apocalypse will feature a life-size figure of the Pope having been struck by a meteorite, and photographs by Wolfgang Tillman who is famous for depicting his lover masturbating. The show is not, according to its curator Norman Rosenthal, about 'shocking people'. 'But it is,' he explains helpfully, 'about shock.' Rosenthal plans to mount a similar show annually. He does not say what he will call the event that comes after Apocalypse. B is for Bowie, chameleon-like rock guru, whose current incarnation sees him as a major collector of contemporary art, proprietor of the journal Modern Painters, dauber of neo-Cubist paintings and designer of wallpaper for Laura Ashley. Though less respectful artists accuse of him of being a dabbler, Bowie is beaten only by Madonna as a celebrity spot at gallery openings. B is also for Joseph Beuys, the late German artist famous for empty coat-hangers, and for the phrase 'x is the new Beuys', routinely applied to all artists fresh out of Goldsmith's College. C is for the writer and TV presenter Matthew Collings, the mutton-chopped, monosyllabic chronicler of the mini-Renaissance in British art. It is also for the Chapman Brothers, Jake and Dinos, its enfants terribles. Collings trenchantly and typically describes the Chapmans' plastic sculptures of mutant young girls with dildoes for noses as 'seemingly very tied to the problems of real modern life'. And he keeps an ever so straight, slightly puzzled, face while he does so. D is for Damien Hirst, responsible for first putting British artists on tabloid front pages. At art school, when confronted with a blank canvas, Hirst posed one of the seminal questions of post-postmodern aesthetics: 'What do I do now,' he mused to himself, 'paint a fucking horse or a dog or something?' E is for elephant dung, lumps of which, when adhered to a painting of the Virgin Mary by Turner Prize winner Chris Ofili, got up the nose of New York's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani, a Catholic, apparently missed the witty observation on Ofili's cultural heritage that the excreta offered, and attempted instead to ban the Sensation show in which it figured. His actions brought such notable art radicals as the situationist Hugh Grant flocking to the opening in support of the seminal role of extravagant faeces in modern culture. F is for formaldehyde, medium of choice for contemporary artists plagued by the big questions: death and pickling. These haunted figures also have a hankering for all things stainless steel, especially old dentists' drills and their aunt's medicine cabinet, the contents of which are taken as mute reminders of mortality: Alka Seltzer thus becomes the modern momento mori; Elastoplast our Yorick's skull. G is for Gilbert and George, reluctant gay dads of the newer wave of British artists, the anal retentive Morecambe and Wise to the younger generation's more relaxed Vic and Bob. G is also for Groucho Club, where said relaxed artists torture themselves about what it all means, and allow their more inspired work to quietly gestate while they pick arcane fights with former agents. H is for Hoxton, the district of east London to which most of the above eventually stagger home. British artists enjoy a symbiotic relationship with British property developers: like the smell of freshly baked bread and recently ground coffee, their very presence in the vicinity of a derelict warehouse ups its asking price fivefold. Before long, to the delight of locals, there is a Starbucks on the corner and an organic deli in the basement. See also: Southwark, Bermondsey etc I is for installation, a useful catch-all term for what artists are up to when not at the Groucho Club. An installation can be an odd blue light, a nest of maggots or a fried egg, but such things can only become installations when they are married to a concept. The offspring of an installation and a concept is what we now understand as art. I is also for irony, without which many concepts would just be desperate ideas. J is for gallery owner Jay Jopling, the Eton-educated, Savile Row-suited son of a Tory peer, who personifies the seismic shift in the class attitudes brought about by the hotspurs of the new new thing. Through his gallery, White Cube, Jopling represents the likes of Tracey Emin and sculptor Antony (Angel of the North) Gormley. He is, his more unwashed clients are at pains to explain, such a deeply establishment figure that, when viewed in a certain light, he is radically anti-establishment. This fine distinction is only apparent to the carefully trained artistic eye. K is for Anish Kapoor, Bombay-born artist famed as an explorer of 'negative space'. It is also for Jeff Koons, sculptor of porcelain Michael Jacksons and ex-husband of porn star La Cicciolina. L is for Lottery, the serendipitous benefactor to the new golden age of galleries, including Tate Modern which opens to the public on Friday. The National Lottery is, of course, proof positive that most ordinary people in Britain are tireless in their support of contemporary visual art and are also more than happy to support the bar bills of its practitioners. L is also for loft, chosen abode of those who want to share in the new, wild artistic lifestyle: pension fund managers, perhaps, or auditors. M is for Madonna, without whose imprimatur no gallery extension would ever be taken remotely seriously. M is also for Tate Modern, of which Madonna is the unofficial mascot. The correct response to the question 'What's the new Tate like?' when posed by cultural historians and cab drivers is, of course: 'I don't know, but Madonna will be at the opening...' N is for Bruce Nauman, cowboy high priest of conceptualism, who early in his career made a memorable half-hour video of himself juggling with his testicles. Nauman now lives in New Mexico, where he whispers to horses and makes hellish carousels out of taxidermist's moulds. N is also for nihilism, neo-conceptualism and nonsense. O is for opening, the raison d'etre behind much of the best offerings in modern art. It is during the opening that new concepts are revealed for the first time, and their progenitors have a chance to explain them with full rigour to an ever-anxious public. Openings are generally sponsored by large corporations with a desire to seem non-corporate; Absolut vodka is mandatory. P is for painting, which no one can be bothered much with now, except iconoclasts such as Gary Hume, who does it in an ironic, conceptual kind of way, and Damien Hirst who has his assistants colour in dots on a canvas which he can sell for \u00a360,000. Hirst is apparently angry with British Airways who he believes have borrowed his coloured dots concept for their logo to promote the cheap and cheerful airline, Go. It's a terrible rip-off, he complains. Q is for Quo Vadis, a restaurant owned by Marco Pierre White and decorated at one time by Hirst. The artist's installations were removed by White after it was claimed they put diners off their food. Even so, the collaboration proved that art is now capable of invading every sacred corner of our cultural life, even the contemporary holy of holies: the designer kitchen. Q is also for Marc Quinn, an artist whose work, some suggest, provides a commentary on this cross-fertilisation between visual and alimentary art. (Quinn makes figurative heads out of blood: sculptural black puddings.) R is for Norman Rosenthal, the P.T. Barnum of the Royal Academy, and the man responsible for Sensation and, now, Apocalypse. In between times Rosenthal has also put together the Monet in the 20th Century exhibition, which was modern at least in the amount of money it took and the T-shirts it shifted. R is also for rock and roll, as in 'Britart is the new...' or 'Monet is the new...'? S is for Nick Serota, the saintly driving force behind Tate Modern which promises to do for London roughly what the Guggenheim did for Bilbao, only more so - bring in planeloads of American tourists. S is also for Saatchi, Thatcher's adman who early on cornered the market in British extremism and subsequently flogged it to anyone who would listen. And, coincidentally, it is for shark. T is for Turner Prize and also for Tracey Emin, who have shared many long and extremely emotional evenings together. T is also for Tracey's tent. Crawling inside it to read the embroidered names of everyone she had ever slept with was, for some, the artistic epiphany of the past decade. For others it served as a reminder of wet family holidays in Wales. U is for underground, the place that most of the loft-owning and headline-making artists claim to inhabit. V is for value for money. In a recent documentary Tracey Emin was filmed making crude little pencil sketches of her naked self. Each sketch took about a minute. Jay Jopling later suggested that he sold these drawings for up to \u00a33,000, and that represented 'good value for money'. W is for Rachel Whiteread, Gillian Wearing, Sam Taylor Wood and the Wilson Twins (Jane and Louise), who with their own feminine lusts for life prove that art is no longer to be regarded as a Kirk Douglas-type guy thing. X is (almost) for explosion, like the one that blew Cornelia Parker's garden shed to smithereens, only for her to hang it all back together as a shed installation (not one you could keep the lawnmower in). X is also for the generation of slackers who hang out at openings. Y is for YBA (Young British Artist), an acronym which has widely given way to MABAWIP (Middle Aged British Artists With Investment Portfolios). Z is for zeitgeisty, a description that was once never far from the lips of any worth-their-salt critic of the YBAs, but now it is somewhat just a little twentieth century.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>Antonio Carluccio</b> My first contact with Drew was many, many years ago when he told me he was picking mushrooms in Scotland, and wondered if I'd be interested in being supplied by him. I said yes, naturally, as I was buying mushrooms from all over the place for the Neal Street Restaurant, which I had taken over from Terence [Conran] in 1981. <p>Mushrooms have always been my passion, and when I saw that he was reacting to my writing and filming about mushrooms, I thought it was lovely that someone in England had caught the commerciality of that, because in Europe it's always been a big business, whereas in England it was just taking off. </p> <p>When I first started taking mushrooms from Drew, he explained that he was putting together a sort of net of pickers and making it a really commercial thing. He sent the mushrooms down to me by aeroplane and would personally escort them to the plane, and they were lovely mushrooms: chanterelles, ceps, whatever was in season, and all of the highest quality. At the same time, my name as a mushroom expert was growing and I had people contacting me from various parts of the world asking if they could buy mushrooms from me.

Originally, I wanted to run a mushroom company myself, but I decided it would be better to leave it to someone who had the time to do it properly.

I started to learn the difference between mushrooms when I was about six. It's a fantastic pastime. You are in the woods with nature and you are part of it, collecting something that's lovely to look at, lovely to smell and lovely to eat. What more could you want? They say it's best to go in the morning to avoid competition, but in this country if you go in the afternoon they're still there. </p> <p>I remember passing a group of 10 wonderful porcini on the side of a road once and I thought I'd like to go home and pick up the camera and take a picture of them. In Italy it would be impossible to do that. They wouldn't even have grown that large But here they were large and in their prime, and I had time to go home, pick up the camera and go back and photograph them before picking them. Nobody had taken them. </p> <p>Drew makes my business a lot simpler. Before he came along I was getting my mushrooms from all over the place. I once put an advert in the Polish daily paper in London saying that I would buy the surplus of any reader's hunts, and we had a queue of people outside the restaurant with two or three kilos of mushrooms each. It was really lovely, and I still have contact with some of them. I also have people from Wales and Cornwall who send me their mushrooms, but I buy the bulk from Drew, as we use at least 100 kilos a week. Drew is very much a gentleman. He's invited me to Scotland several times, but I rarely have the time to go, though I do want to spend more time with him, picking mushrooms or whatever. Drew and I are a funny combination, although we work very well together. We are a sort of unspoken team. It's not arranged, but we certainly think of each other when it comes to business. Like me, Drew also appreciates the flavour of mushrooms. He loves every aspect of them. It's fantastic that you can make a business out of something you really like, which is something we have both managed to do.</p> <p><b>Drew Macpherson </b>The first time I met Antonio was when he came up to Scotland with one of his suppliers in about 1988.

When I met Antonio we had about 20 pickers, now we have 300 or so, and they vary from people who do it seriously to grannies who just go out for a walk in the afternoon.

      "bodyText": "Antonio Carluccio My first contact with Drew was many, many years ago when he told me he was picking mushrooms in Scotland, and wondered if I'd be interested in being supplied by him. I said yes, naturally, as I was buying mushrooms from all over the place for the Neal Street Restaurant, which I had taken over from Terence [Conran] in 1981. Mushrooms have always been my passion, and when I saw that he was reacting to my writing and filming about mushrooms, I thought it was lovely that someone in England had caught the commerciality of that, because in Europe it's always been a big business, whereas in England it was just taking off. When I first started taking mushrooms from Drew, he explained that he was putting together a sort of net of pickers and making it a really commercial thing. He sent the mushrooms down to me by aeroplane and would personally escort them to the plane, and they were lovely mushrooms: chanterelles, ceps, whatever was in season, and all of the highest quality. At the same time, my name as a mushroom expert was growing and I had people contacting me from various parts of the world asking if they could buy mushrooms from me. But I couldn't touch this commercial side of things as I had too many other things to get on with, so I passed on all those contacts to him. Drew and I got along straight away. Originally, I wanted to run a mushroom company myself, but I decided it would be better to leave it to someone who had the time to do it properly.

      "body": "<p>It does not take a lot of brainpower to work out that loyalty cards are pretty useless when every store has got one. But it seems it takes the arrival of a new chief executive to make a store group brave enough to ditch one. </p> <p>Safeway was already questioning the value of its ABC card when Carlos Criado-Perez took over as chief executive last November. But it was his decision to focus on getting new customers, rather than persuading the existing ones to spend more, that finally led to its demise. When every potential customer has a range of loyalty cards, all offering pretty much the same benefits, it takes something extra to attract them into the store. </p> <p>Safeway was already spending \u00a330 million on price cuts to do just that - with reasonable success, judging by the 10 per cent rise in sales volumes achieved in the first three months of the year. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Criado-Perez decided to see what could be achieved by switching the \u00a360m annual cost of the ABC card into more targeted promotions. </p> <p>Even allowing for the smoke and mirrors which usually accompany any supermarket price-cutting campaign, offers such as half-price cornflakes and 40 per cent off washing powder look serious. The impact on margins should be less severe than this suggests: Safeway admits that almost three-quarters of the \u00a3500m cost of these promotions this year will be financed by cutting discounts on peripheral items. The question is, will the campaign change shoppers' perception of its price positioning enough to win them back from rivals? </p> <p>The results from the existing \u00a330m campaign are encouraging. It estimates that it has added 750,000 shoppers, an 8 per cent increase. </p> <p>While that has been at a cost of a 4 per cent cut in prices, around twice the level of deflation in the rest of the industry, the volume increase is more than compensating. </p> <p>Can that continue? The initial campaign will already have attracted more cost-conscious shoppers. It is unlikely that multiplying the cost of the promotion by four will multiply the benefits by four, although Safeway hopes that it will encourage more of them to use its stores for their main, rather than their secondary, shopping. </p> <p>But rivals are unlikely to stand back and watch their customers defect to Safeway; the more they retaliate, the more Safeway's benefits will be competed away. It is trying to differentiate itself by focusing just on fresh food and service, eschewing the cheap televisions, t-shirts and telephones that are littering the stores of its rivals. But it has still to demonstrate that it can offer what it promises. </p> <p>It is coming from a long way behind. As finance director Simon Laffin points out, its sales per square foot still languish more than 10 per cent behind its rivals. If it gets its strategy right this time, it could end up being one of the fastest-growing food retailers. That may make a forward multiple of 12.5 times earnings look cheap. </p> <p><strong> Cement does not yield</strong><br> </p> <p>When the history of the technology bubble comes to be written, the escape of cement maker Blue Circle from the clutches of French rival Lafarge is likely to be seen as a key turning point. </p> <p>Just four months ago, investors were so convinced that the old economy had had its day that they would have accepted just about any cash offer for their shares in boring old builders, metal bashers, retailers and the rest. </p> <p>Now, the realisation is slowly dawning that, while technology may be the growth story of the future, the prices of many new-economy stocks is discounting that growth into infinity. And, while old-fashioned companies may not match them in growth rates, they also do not match them in valuation. Quite simply, they had become too cheap. </p> <p>Blue Circle is fortunate that the realisation came just in time to stop its shareholders accepting Lafarge's penny-pinching offer. Chief executive Rick Haythornthwaite and his team now have to justify their faith. That will be challenging. Malaysia is undoubtedly worth more than Lafarge gave it credit for, but it is still dogged by overcapacity and low prices. The zeal to deliver promised cost cuts often diminishes when the threat of takeover dies. </p> <p>But Lafarge has shown no inclination to ditch its 29.6 per cent stake, so Blue Circle would be wise to keep its mind focused on the \u00a3116m of efficiency gains. </p> <p>Blue Circle's victory should make other bargain-hunters pause and reconsider. Old economy companies can take heart. </p> <p><strong> Consolidation cocktail</strong><br> </p> <p>If Rick Haythornthwaite is the man charged with keeping Blue Circle independent, Philip Bowman, who holds the same post at Allied Domecq, could be seen as the boss whose job is to make his company more saleable.

      "body": "<p>One lucky beneficiary of a bid for Sports Internet, the online news and betting firm, could be sportswear outfit Hay &amp; Robertson, one of our favourite shares of last year. </p> <p>H&amp;R, if you remember, sold a 49 per cent stake in Sports e-tail, its own Internet commerce division, to Sports Internet earlier this year for \u00a36 million in cash and \u00a314m in shares. That gave it a 6 per cent stake in Sports Internet, which may bring in a tidy profit if a bid does materialise. </p> <p>More importantly, if the suitors are indeed the likes of BSkyB or cable company NTL, it brings in a powerful partner for H&amp;R's e-commerce activities, which already extend to marketing England and Manchester United strips, as well as its own Admiral and Kangol brands. </p> <p>We last recommended H&amp;R shares at 193p last November and by January they had doubled to 390p. After all the turbulence on the stock market, the shares have now slipped back to 243p. That's still a nice profit, though. Hold on for further positive news. </p> <p><strong> Flight to fancy</strong><br> </p> <p>People looking to pick, for their Peps and Isas, small stocks with a good record and promising future, may want to check out Watermark Group, the brand promotion and merchandising company. As broker Charles Stanley points out, Watermark is the only firm to have graduated so far from Ofex and Aim to a full listing. </p> <p>Over the past five years, sales have risen by 23 per cent compound. Yet at 16 times prospective earnings the stock is rated at a substantial discount to the media sector. </p> <p>Watermark provides promotional merchandise for a blue chip list of airlines, travel firms, consumer product companies and charities. It is also into sales promotion and the management of spectacular outdoor events for the likes of Walt Disney's Buena Vista, Ben &amp; Jerry's and the Millennium Commission. </p> <p>Most recently, for a nominal sum, it also took a 10 per cent stake in FlightStore, a new firm set up to sell branded products in-flight through seat-back TVs. The idea is that passengers will be able to browse through a catalogue on their in-flight screens and order with a credit card for delivery to a specified address. At the moment the number of long-haul passengers with access to screens is 100 million: this is forecast to rise to 500 million by 2003 - clearly a growth market with huge untapped potential. </p> <p>Charles Stanley has set a target price of 100p for Watermark shares, against 76.5p now. At a PE of 20, that is still a sector discount. And every \u00a3100m of value created by the promising FlightStore would add 40p to Watermark's share price.

      "bodyText": "One lucky beneficiary of a bid for Sports Internet, the online news and betting firm, could be sportswear outfit Hay &amp; Robertson, one of our favourite shares of last year. H&amp;R, if you remember, sold a 49 per cent stake in Sports e-tail, its own Internet commerce division, to Sports Internet earlier this year for \u00a36 million in cash and \u00a314m in shares. That gave it a 6 per cent stake in Sports Internet, which may bring in a tidy profit if a bid does materialise. More importantly, if the suitors are indeed the likes of BSkyB or cable company NTL, it brings in a powerful partner for H&amp;R's e-commerce activities, which already extend to marketing England and Manchester United strips, as well as its own Admiral and Kangol brands. We last recommended H&amp;R shares at 193p last November and by January they had doubled to 390p. After all the turbulence on the stock market, the shares have now slipped back to 243p. That's still a nice profit, though. Hold on for further positive news. Flight to fancy People looking to pick, for their Peps and Isas, small stocks with a good record and promising future, may want to check out Watermark Group, the brand promotion and merchandising company. As broker Charles Stanley points out, Watermark is the only firm to have graduated so far from Ofex and Aim to a full listing. Over the past five years, sales have risen by 23 per cent compound. Yet at 16 times prospective earnings the stock is rated at a substantial discount to the media sector. Watermark provides promotional merchandise for a blue chip list of airlines, travel firms, consumer product companies and charities. It is also into sales promotion and the management of spectacular outdoor events for the likes of Walt Disney's Buena Vista, Ben &amp; Jerry's and the Millennium Commission. Most recently, for a nominal sum, it also took a 10 per cent stake in FlightStore, a new firm set up to sell branded products in-flight through seat-back TVs. The idea is that passengers will be able to browse through a catalogue on their in-flight screens and order with a credit card for delivery to a specified address. At the moment the number of long-haul passengers with access to screens is 100 million: this is forecast to rise to 500 million by 2003 - clearly a growth market with huge untapped potential. Charles Stanley has set a target price of 100p for Watermark shares, against 76.5p now. At a PE of 20, that is still a sector discount. And every \u00a3100m of value created by the promising FlightStore would add 40p to Watermark's share price. Well worth a look. Jelly poor show Those of you who took our advice to avoid like the plague the Internet 'wonder stock' Jellyworks have reasons to be cheerful.

'In action or in inaction, it cannot shelter behind the MPC,' says Gerald Holtham, global strategist at Norwich Union Investment Management,and former head of the IPPR,who has been in the vanguard of arguing for an intervention to cool down the pound against the euro (Observer Business 9 April). </p> <p>Currency market intervention has not been tried since the Exchange Rate Mechanism debacle of 1992, when the Government intervened to prop up sterling by using foreign exchange reserves. But ultimately this wasn't enough and the pound famously fell out of the ERM. </p> <p>The Government's abstinence from intervention has coincided with sterling soaring against the euro, the key exchange rate for British exports - about 50 per cent of exports are made to euroland. </p> <p>In the early Eighties, the US curtailed interventions, and the dollar soared. By 1985, the overvalued dollar was causing global distortions: the exchange rate against the pound had increased by 100 per cent. That September, the G7 finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the Plaza Agreement - a co-ordinated effort to puncture the dollar bubble: $10 billion was spent in six weeks. A fortnight later the dollar had fallen 10 per cent against the yen, and a year later by over a third. </p> <p>Critics claim the action coincided with the dollar's peak, rather than being the cause of its fall. The Louvre Accord to stabilise the dollar in 1987 did not reverse its decline - . conforms to a general rule that says it's easier to temper a rising currency than to prop up a falling one. </p> <p>The pound's withdrawal from the ERM, at a cost to the taxpayer of \u00a33bn, showed the impotence of central bank reserves when faced with the full might of the currency markets. The global value of currency trading is some $1.5 trillion a day, almost three times the value of total central bank reserves. </p> <p>The temptation to leave the markets alone is based on a belief in the efficiency of a market trading a uniform product in such huge volumes. But exchange rates do not always reflect the under lying economic fundamentals.

Thus any intervention in the UK would represent a surprise policy change, and wipe off that premium relatively easily, in anticipation of future interventions. </p> <p>But a falling market is difficult to control. The fall in the dollar caused by the Plaza Agreement was so great that within 18 months the Louvre Accord was required to stabilise it. As well as the inflationary worries - a tumbling currency would cause more expensive imports - there is a real danger that a fall could spiral out of control. </p> <p>Intervention is a difficult business to get 'right'.

The economic fundamentals point to undervaluation, yet it continues to sink. </p> <p>The mechanics of intervention are complex. But the MPC need not be involved. Holtham suggests giving the euro a jolt and cooling the pound by exploiting differences between pound and euro bond yields. This sterilised intervention could be funded by using the \u00a322.5bn receipts from the mobile phone auction. This move might help depress the pound, and could also prove lucrative compared with repaying the public debt. </p> <p>'What sense can it make to buy [back] paper yielding 4.5 per cent in a currency you believe to be overvalued, rather than buying paper yielding 5.5 per cent in a currency you believe to be undervalued?' says Holtham 'It is a crime against the taxpayer. Since buying the right paper might depress the pound, not doing so is also a crime against British industry.' </p> <p>Abstinence from intervention stems from the experience of 1992. Previously there was too much faith in the power of currency intervention. Now there may be too little. It's simply a question of whether the health of manufacturing industry is worth the risk. </p> <p><strong> William Keegan</strong> </p> <p><strong>The eurozone shouldn't panic - yet</strong> Crisis? What crisis? The press and airwaves have been full of gloom and doom - or schadenfreude, depending on your point of view - about the euro as it plumbs 'historic' depths or 'lifetime lows.' </p> <p>Yet the very week in which it fell below its latest (non-) resistance point of 90 cents (having previously dropped through $1.10 cents and $1) the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) confidently pronounced: 'The economic prospects for western Europe now appear to be better than at any time in the last decade.' </p> <p>In its annual Economic Survey of Europe, the ECE declared: 'In the second half of 1999, the region finally shook off the sluggishness of activity which had marked 1998 and early 1999, and by the third quarter (and probably the fourth as well) Gross Domestic Product was growing at an annual rate of around 3.5 per cent.' </p> <p>According to the ECE, higher exports helped to get the recovery going in the early part of 1999, 'but given the high levels of interdependence of the European economies, this quickly had multiplier effects on demand through most of the EU. Business and consumer confidence strengthened considerably.' </p> <p>Thus exports were helped by improved price competitiveness resulting from the strong dollar (or weak euro) as well as by the revival of east Asian and other markets, and the sheer strength of demand from the US. </p> <p>By the second half of 1999, net exports were making a strong positive contribution to western European economic growth, although private consumption was the 'mainstay' of the recovery. </p> <p>But that was western Europe as a whole, including the UK. The annual report of the European Central Bank (ECB), which concentrates on the 11 eurozone countries, reminds us the UK is the largest marketwith 19.3 per cent of eurozone exports. </p> <p>Separate British statistics show that the volume of UK exports fell by the equivalent of an annual 10 per cent during 1999's fourth quarter, while imports rose at a similar rate. The weak euro and the strong pound were combining to assist the eurozone's economic recovery; and the lack of UK price competitiveness was also allowing our continental neighbours - whom New Labour ministers had been shamelessly lecturing on how to run an economy - to beat the UK in exporting to third markets. </p> <p>The eurozone economies had undergone five years of fiscal tightening, as part of the 'Maastricht process', in the run-up to the start of the single currency in January 1999. The International Monetary Fund executive board praised the impact of the 'timely monetary easing' (ECB interest rates were reduced from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent on 8 April last year) on economic growth. </p> <p>John Llewellyn, global chief economist at Lehman Brothers, says: 'Growth picked up almost as soon as fiscal policy returned to neutral in 1999, and is now solid and broadly based.' </p> <p>While the IMF is concerned that the ECB could damage the recovery by raising rates too enthusiastically (they are now back to 3.75 per cent). Llewellyn, a former top economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, maintains that the ECB policy poses no threat, and that the central bank is 'slowly taking interest rates back to neutral.' </p> <p>Given the timelags in the economy, the full impact of the decline in the euro on higher growth and lower unemployment has yet to be fully felt. And given the still-high level of unemployment in the eurozone, there is no obvious reason why core economies such as Germany should be concerned about the devaluation of the euro since 1 January 1999. </p> <p>On the contrary. Taking the fall in the euro's rate against the dollar since its inception involves comparisons with what is essentially an artificial benchmark. As Paul Chertkow, of the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, has pointed out, the trading range of the 'synthetic euro' - the euro or its equivalent before 1 January 1999, was between $1.70 in December 1979 and $0.69 in February 1985. </p> <p>The ECB has been pretty consistent in saying, during a number of euro 'scares', that it would be concerned about the falling euro only if it began to threaten achievement of its inflation target of 0 to 2 per cent. </p> <p>Last week the ECB's vice-president, Christian Noyer, conceded the recent slide 'puts pressure on price stability'. But the French are keener than the Germans, and so far the benefits to growth of the falling euro seem to have outweighed the inflationary disadvantages. </p> <p>Noyer ended the week saying: 'Intervetion is a tool in our hands. We may use it if deemed necessary.'</p>",

According to the ECE, higher exports helped to get the recovery going in the early part of 1999, 'but given the high levels of interdependence of the European economies, this quickly had multiplier effects on demand through most of the EU. Business and consumer confidence strengthened considerably.' Thus exports were helped by improved price competitiveness resulting from the strong dollar (or weak euro) as well as by the revival of east Asian and other markets, and the sheer strength of demand from the US. By the second half of 1999, net exports were making a strong positive contribution to western European economic growth, although private consumption was the 'mainstay' of the recovery. But that was western Europe as a whole, including the UK. The annual report of the European Central Bank (ECB), which concentrates on the 11 eurozone countries, reminds us the UK is the largest marketwith 19.3 per cent of eurozone exports. Separate British statistics show that the volume of UK exports fell by the equivalent of an annual 10 per cent during 1999's fourth quarter, while imports rose at a similar rate. The weak euro and the strong pound were combining to assist the eurozone's economic recovery; and the lack of UK price competitiveness was also allowing our continental neighbours - whom New Labour ministers had been shamelessly lecturing on how to run an economy - to beat the UK in exporting to third markets. The eurozone economies had undergone five years of fiscal tightening, as part of the 'Maastricht process', in the run-up to the start of the single currency in January 1999. The International Monetary Fund executive board praised the impact of the 'timely monetary easing' (ECB interest rates were reduced from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent on 8 April last year) on economic growth. John Llewellyn, global chief economist at Lehman Brothers, says: 'Growth picked up almost as soon as fiscal policy returned to neutral in 1999, and is now solid and broadly based.' While the IMF is concerned that the ECB could damage the recovery by raising rates too enthusiastically (they are now back to 3.75 per cent). Llewellyn, a former top economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, maintains that the ECB policy poses no threat, and that the central bank is 'slowly taking interest rates back to neutral.' Given the timelags in the economy, the full impact of the decline in the euro on higher growth and lower unemployment has yet to be fully felt. And given the still-high level of unemployment in the eurozone, there is no obvious reason why core economies such as Germany should be concerned about the devaluation of the euro since 1 January 1999. On the contrary. Taking the fall in the euro's rate against the dollar since its inception involves comparisons with what is essentially an artificial benchmark. As Paul Chertkow, of the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, has pointed out, the trading range of the 'synthetic euro' - the euro or its equivalent before 1 January 1999, was between $1.70 in December 1979 and $0.69 in February 1985. The ECB has been pretty consistent in saying, during a number of euro 'scares', that it would be concerned about the falling euro only if it began to threaten achievement of its inflation target of 0 to 2 per cent. Last week the ECB's vice-president, Christian Noyer, conceded the recent slide 'puts pressure on price stability'. But the French are keener than the Germans, and so far the benefits to growth of the falling euro seem to have outweighed the inflationary disadvantages. Noyer ended the week saying: 'Intervetion is a tool in our hands. We may use it if deemed necessary.'",

      "body": "<p>A week tomorrow, 12 jurors in Florida will meet to decide whether, and by how much, they should punish the tobacco industry. The case, which is expected to last for up to two months, is already being hailed as a landmark. </p> <p>The anti-smoking lobby says it marks the beginning of the end for the industry. The tobacco companies dismiss it as just another court procedure, which will be overturned on appeal. </p> <p>Both would agree on two things. The Engel case is the first class action against tobacco companies to be heard in a US court. It is also the first significant case to be heard since the industry agreed to a settlement under which US states, including Florida, receive a share of $246 billion (\u00a3160bn) over the next 25 years in exchange for giving up the right to take legal action against tobacco companies. These are both having a significant influence on proceedings. </p> <p>Big Tobacco - the generic name for the big manufacturers such as Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds and Brown &amp; Williamson, US subsidiary of British American Tobacco - has already been found guilty by the Florida jury of fraudulently conspiring to make a dangerous, addictive product that causes cancer, heart disease and other illnesses. Last month it awarded a total of $12.7m compensation to Mary Farnan, Angie Della Vecchia and Frank Amodeo, three representatives of the class of Florida smokers behind the Engel action. </p> <p>Next week's hearing is to decide on punitive damages, which some estimate could go as high as $300bn. That has raised before the industry the spectre of bankruptcy. Worse, court rules say defendants have to post a bond, equal to the amount of damages awarded, before they can appeal. That raised the prospect of the industry going bust before it had the chance to argue its innocence. </p> <p>The anti-smoking camp claims the $300bn figure was dreamt up by the industry as a tactic to frighten the states into giving them protection. If so, it has worked. Late on Friday the Florida Senate passed a Bill limiting the amount of any bond to the lower of $100m or 10 per cent of the tobacco companies' net worth. </p> <p>Some say that simply codifies existing Florida law, which prohibits a damages award so high that it puts a company out of business. All the tobacco companies could easily pay that level of bond. </p> <p>More interesting than the amount, however, is the logic behind it. The Florida legislature was driven less by concern about the financial stability of the tobacco industry - although it is one of the tobacco-growing states - than by the prospect of $18bn in revenue disappearing. A bankrupt industry would hardly be able to carry on paying the $246bn agreed under the state settlements. </p> <p>That is an interesting side-effect of the states' settlement with the industry. Not only does it stop them taking legal action against cigarette makers, it could also encourage them to protect the tobacco industry against legislative onslaughts from others. Indeed, a number of other states have already introduced legislation limiting the amount of bond payments. </p> <p>'Although it seemed obvious that the (agreement) would create a financial partnership between the leading US tobacco manufacturers and the states,' said Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the New York broker, 'the Engel punitive damages bonding process provides the first conclusive evidence that the agreement can have a real worldwide legislative impact. </p> <p>'These efforts are truly extraordinary and make us increasingly optimistic that, if faced with similar financial risks, other states may take similar protective action.' </p> <p>Anti-tobacco campaigners are furious, seeing the legislation as just another way of protecting the interests of Big Tobacco. They are pushing the states to sever their links with the industry by securitising their payments, as a few states, New York among them, have already done. That does give them the money in a lump sum - though they have to settle for a bit less than they would get by taking it in instalments - but it does not fully break their ties with the industry. If the tobacco companies default, the securitisation company simply claims back from the states. </p> <p>But there is another spin-off from the settlement which could benefit the industry. It gives them another legal defence, and the signs are that the industry is already taking full advantage of it. Under the agreement, the tobacco companies had to cut their advertising, particularly when it could be seen by young people, fund anti-smoking campaigns and pay for a foundation to study smoking-related diseases. This all had to be paid for from an increase in the price of tobacco which, the states hoped, would reduce the level of smoking. It is policed by the attorney-generals of the states, who act against any breach of the terms. </p> <p>That means the industry can claim it is reformed. It has already been punished by making the payments (although, given that the cost has to be recouped through price rises, that is rather tenuous) so should not be punished again. It has admitted the error of its ways and is making amends. It can also claim that its behaviour is being thoroughly policed by the states, so the courts no longer need to mete out punishment in damage awards. </p> <p>That argument is likely to be heavily used in Florida in the coming months - indeed, Philip Morris has already started the campaign with newspaper ads emphasising its changed attitudes. It may not be that successful. Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds used these arguments in California, but Lesley Whiteley, a woman who did not even start smoking until after the health warnings started appearing on cigarette packets and who had a history of marijuana abuse, was awarded $1.7m compensation and $20m punitive damages. </p> <p>It is one of the three cases which have gone against the tobacco industry and are now on appeal. Engel will also be subject to an appeal immediately it ends. Indeed, the industry has been trying to get it thrown out since it was filed in 1994. </p> <p>It has argued that smokers, who smoke different brands, for different periods, and have different illnesses, cannot be treated as a class. And it has argued that it is impossible to determine punitive damages for every smoker until the courts have decided on their level of compensation. There could be as many as a million Florida smokers, and if compensation had to be determined first the whole process could take years. So far, however, the higher Florida courts have refused to intervene. </p> <p>The industry is confident it will eventually win. It insists the class action will be thrown out by the higher courts - and it always appeals right to the Supreme Court if necessary. It is also confident that the three individual victories will be overturned. </p> <p>History provides some justification for this optimism. Since the first suit was launched in 1954, only 50 cases have come to court. All victories in lower courts have been overturned on appeal. No class action has ever been successful - although two, in Maryland and Louisiana, are still pending, probably awaiting the outcome in Florida. </p> <p>But the pace of litigation continues to accelerate. More than 300 cases are pending and prosecution lawyers - who have still not made a penny out of tobacco litigation - are finding more and more ingenious ways of getting under tobacco's defences. </p> <p>The anti-smoking lobby believes that the three recent individual victories and the decision to allow the Florida class action to proceed are hugely significant. Richard Daynard, chair of the Tobacco Products Liability Group, says the key is the recent discovery of documents showing that the tobacco companies knew of the risks years ago but covered them up. 'In every case where they have been used, the plaintiff has won.' </p> <p>The history of tobacco litigation suggests that victories are usually short-lived. Will that be true of the current crop of cases? That will take longer than the duration of the Engel case to find out. But the future of Big Tobacco depends on it. </p> <p><strong>Dragging on: 50 years of US smoking tussles</strong></p> <p><strong> 1954</strong> First lawsuit by lung cancer victim alleging negligence.

It is also confident that the three individual victories will be overturned. History provides some justification for this optimism. Since the first suit was launched in 1954, only 50 cases have come to court. All victories in lower courts have been overturned on appeal. No class action has ever been successful - although two, in Maryland and Louisiana, are still pending, probably awaiting the outcome in Florida. But the pace of litigation continues to accelerate. More than 300 cases are pending and prosecution lawyers - who have still not made a penny out of tobacco litigation - are finding more and more ingenious ways of getting under tobacco's defences. The anti-smoking lobby believes that the three recent individual victories and the decision to allow the Florida class action to proceed are hugely significant. Richard Daynard, chair of the Tobacco Products Liability Group, says the key is the recent discovery of documents showing that the tobacco companies knew of the risks years ago but covered them up. 'In every case where they have been used, the plaintiff has won.' The history of tobacco litigation suggests that victories are usually short-lived. Will that be true of the current crop of cases? That will take longer than the duration of the Engel case to find out. But the future of Big Tobacco depends on it.

      "body": "<p>'There once was a place where neighbours greeted neighbours in the quiet of summer twilight. Where children chased fireflies. And porch swings provided easy refuge from the care of the day. The moviehouse showed cartoons on Saturday. The grocery store delivered. And there was one teacher who always knew you who had that \"special something\". Remember that place? Perhaps from your childhood. Or maybe just from stories. It held a magic all its own. The special magic of an American home town. Now, the people at Disney - itself an American family tradition - are creating a place that celebrates this legacy. A place that recalls the timeless traditions and boundless spirit that are the best parts of who we are' - Celebration advertising campaign</p> <p><b>The Rules</b></p> <p><b>Behind their traditional Victorian and Colonial revival style facades, homeowners can live as they please. But exteriors are a different matter\u0085</b></p> <p>While the developer could alter site plans at will, no homeowner or builder could stray very far from the dictates of the 70-page Pattern Book. The community patterns established 'correct' proportions for everything from massing and setbacks to the height and opacity of fences (3ft 6in and 60 per cent for Cottage homes, 6ft and 100 per cent for Estate homes), the depth of porches, and the recommended facade material and colour. Landscaping was also strictly regulated: precise percentages are decreed for the appropriate mix of grass, hedges, shrubs and trees. The degree of variety was prescribed: 'No more than two different species of canopy trees, two different species of ornamental trees, five different species of shrubs or hedges, and four different species of ground covers.'</p> <p>'No synthetic or artificial plant materials' were permitted, and no palm trees allowed in the front or side yards. The architectural patterns governed the spacing between elements (dormers, doors, porches, columns and bays), laying down additional rules about the colour of cladding material and other facade features for each of the six prescribed housing styles. For the Coastal style, all windows, trim boards, columns and railings were to be white, but were to be brown in the Mediterranean style; pale green, pale ochre or pale blue in the French; and 'a deeper shade of the body colour' in the Victorian.</p> <p>While there were few Celebrationites who regretted the style policing - the rules were intended to protect property values - in many instances, deviations from the Pattern Book became a matter of dispute between a homeowner and Joe Barnes, the resident town architect responsible for reviewing and approving all building and landscaping plans. If a tasteful historical precedent for a deviation could be cited, then the homeowner had a good case to present, although mutual agreements about taste were a hard target to hit in cases where the detail was inconsistent with the vision of the Pattern Book.</p> <p>One dispute I came across involved the veto of large glass engravings of Victorian golfers on the front door of Al and Judy Ziffer's home on Canaan Place. A precedent had been found in a real Victorian mansion, and Judy approached the dispute as 'a First Amendment issue, a question of civil liberties. If it had cost my whole bankroll for my retirement,' she declared, 'I'd have spent it.' The engravings eventually stayed on the door, though they had not met with official approval. Donna Latour reported a long series of approvals for her house on Golfpark Drive, where many of the features she wanted, including 12ft ceilings and low bay windows, were vetoed as incorrectly Victorian.</p> <p>Buyers whose houses have been rectified in this way closely scrutinise each new home for signs of an overly permissive review. Would anyone ever be allowed to put shutters on their Queen Anne? In the Pattern Book, the interpretation of 'Victorian' draws on the Carpenter Gothic cottage style (characterised by 'steep roof pitches with deep gables and dormers') and a style described as 'a decorated Classical box with a full width porch'. Interpretation of the Pattern Book's own definitions of historical style can be a complicated affair, and it is no surprise that the result often seems overly legalistic. Judgments about what is properly Victorian and what is not can only end up in the realm of farce, worthy of a Monty Python skit.</p> <p><b> Party time</b></p> <p><b>Nurturing community spirit was one of the driving forces behind Celebration. For some people, however, there is such a thing as too much community\u0085</b></p> <p>Residents in the middle-income homes took pride in the fact that all the townsfolk, including apartment tenants, were welcome at their pot-luck parties. Those in the newer and less central neighbourhoods, which had the least expensive, detached homes, made a special effort to attract the rest of the townsfolk. It did not escape notice that residents in estate homes often had their parties catered and that the guest lists were more carefully zoned. In April, Town Hall launched its 'block party trailer' (outfitted with barbecue grills, stereo system, ice chests, hula hoops and water sprinkler games) for general use. Since every act of Town Hall was closely analysed, the chuck wagon was perceived by some as an intervention in the 'block party wars' and as a subtle invitation to keep these events non-exclusive and non-competitive.</p> <p>Competition aside, one block had already achieved an unsurpassable record for its pot-luck performance. On Honeysuckle - an early pioneer row with middle-range Cottage lots - the zest for neighbourliness was running far ahead of expectation. Monthly parties were slated at residents' houses almost two years in advance, and each was announced with ornate invitations. The driving force on Honeysuckle was the home team of Darlene and Fred Rapanotti, who supervised the soirees with cosy precision. Originally from Garden City on Long Island, with a 'five-and-dime on every street corner', the Rapanottis were one of the town's many (ex-) military couples, long accustomed to the regulated environments of military housing.</p> <p>In addition, theirs was one of the houses decorated as a teeming shrine to Disney memorabilia. Shelves, tables, and wall space were lined with figurines, pictures, and sculptures of Walt's entire entourage, including an awesome rendering of Cinderella's Castle. The Rapanotti home was also a fount of hospitality, and I was always received there with uncommon largesse. Darlene was of Chinese-American descent, and had a culinary range to match. Her no-nonsense efforts at pioneering the pot-luck circuit were justly famous and had been lovingly archived. An attendance book registered residents' comments at each event, a photograph album recorded past gatherings, and a range of invitations from each party was preserved. Darlene, who worked at Disney's Caribbean Cruise Lines, had also been active in exporting the pot-luck protocols to other neighbourhoods and had aspirations to link the several circuits together in an annual, communitywide bash. The Honeysuckle pot lucks had hosted votes on block adornments - co-ordinated Christmas decor on the mailboxes - and Darlene wanted to organise discussions on how best to represent the town to visiting journalists in hopes of dispelling the media clich\u00e9 that 'we are all mechanical puppets and Disney mannequins'.</p> <p>Each of the several parties I attended had its own flavour, where hosts would invite their own friends from other parts of town. One event in late summer took the form of an elaborate hay ride to the North Village. Attendance varied. There were regulars and not-so-regulars. To be sure, there were some on the block who found the monthly regimen to be a little more sociability than they cared for, and the Honeysuckle model, while admired from a distance, had set a pace that no other block in town tried to match. In some ways, it represented the tolerable upper limit of community bonding in Celebration.</p> <p>There were many blocks in town where neighbours, lacking willingly active organisers, preferred to socialise informally or loosely attach themselves to the party circuit of an adjoining block. If anything, the pace of community building that had been set here had resulted in partial burnout. Several pioneers acknowledged there was too little time for their own families. Religious leaders, partially in competition with the community professionals at Town Hall and the Foundation, expressed concern that overcommitment to community activity was in danger of producing dysfunctional families. In Celebration, there was such a thing as a little too much community.</p> <p>Besides, block solidarity was an uneasy feature of social life in a town where Town Hall encouraged residents to identify with the whole of Celebration. In his newsletter item discouraging the use of village labels, Brent Herrington, community manager at the Town Hall, warned against 'the tendency of new developments to fracture into separate districts rather than functioning as dynamic, cohesive communities'. Officially, at least, community was intended to be synonymous with the entire town, and professional help was on hand to ensure that community building kept its course. A subtle reward system was in place very early on, where especially active volunteers enjoyed the gratitude of the professionals. Each year, the Foundation handed out Community Service Awards and ran a 'Tattle Tales' section in its newsletter in which residents were encouraged to inform on their 'do-gooder' neighbours. Town Hall had established its own impromptu practice of awarding certificates for community-minded acts, and Herrington rarely missed a public opportunity to comment on 'the incredible organic juice that flows up from the residents'.</p> <p>There was lots of evidence of this juice, but it was still too early to say that the residential fabric had developed the truly organic texture that is the Holy Grail of nostalgic mythmakers and community management professionals alike. Community pride among Celebrationites was a heady cocktail, mixed with equal parts performance anxiety, property angst, and pioneer exuberance. Professional community management, on the other hand, had already proved itself as a well-seasoned vintage. Beyond the machinery of management, however, the battles being fought in town had fashioned community bonds that were arguably stronger than those brought on by the physical advantages of New Urban neighbourliness or the Foundation's culture of volunteerism. This was a sense of community forged out of conditions of adversity, and however much outsiders snorted at the mere idea of Celebrationites suffering, these internal struggles had worked their way into the guts of community building in ways that offered some lessons for the outside world.</p> <p><b> Stepford wives</b></p> <p><b>Outsiders like to compare the women of Celebration to the Stepford wives from the film of the same name - wives reduced to sexually acquiescent doormats by their husbands</b></p> <p>It's no surprise that the 'Stepford wives' label is bitterly resented among the women of Celebration. Not a few described encounters with tourists who asked them directly whether they felt like a Stepford wife. It was not always easy to separate this awareness of being typecast from normal habits of self-presentation. One remarkably independent woman, who did not seem to correspond to the stereotype in any way, confessed to me that she always 'tidied herself up' to pop down to the grocery store 'just in case a tourist took a picture' of her. She wanted to 'represent Celebration in a good light'. How did women, in general, respond to their roles in this community?</p> <p>In my talks with couples, I found that women were less inclined to be 'negative' in their opinions about Celebration, while their husbands often took pleasure in offering their own assessments of the community's problems. I also found that men alone were likely to speak in the first person of their decision to move here or to buy a house, although this habit was more chronic among older couples. As in Stepford, Celebration had its share of wealthy, nonworking wives, with a retinue of home helpers on call, but in many more cases, the economic challenge of moving in and keeping up with monthly payments obliged female homemakers to seek outside work. If anything, when I ran into resentment relating to gender roles, it was directed by women at the spectacle of 'idle' men around town, especially those who were wealthy enough to buy oodles of leisure time.</p> <p>Could a town like Celebration be construed, Stepford-like, as part of a male conspiracy to rein in the womenfolk? In this well-trodden domain of male behaviour, no such conjecture could be entirely dismissed. But it was less easy to make the case here. New Urban design is aimed, in part, at ensuring that suburban women are no longer required to serve as their children's chauffeurs or to be social prisoners in their own subdivision unit.

      "bodyText": "'There once was a place where neighbours greeted neighbours in the quiet of summer twilight. Where children chased fireflies. And porch swings provided easy refuge from the care of the day. The moviehouse showed cartoons on Saturday. The grocery store delivered. And there was one teacher who always knew you who had that \"special something\". Remember that place? Perhaps from your childhood. Or maybe just from stories. It held a magic all its own. The special magic of an American home town. Now, the people at Disney - itself an American family tradition - are creating a place that celebrates this legacy. A place that recalls the timeless traditions and boundless spirit that are the best parts of who we are' - Celebration advertising campaign The Rules Behind their traditional Victorian and Colonial revival style facades, homeowners can live as they please. But exteriors are a different matter\u0085 While the developer could alter site plans at will, no homeowner or builder could stray very far from the dictates of the 70-page Pattern Book. The community patterns established 'correct' proportions for everything from massing and setbacks to the height and opacity of fences (3ft 6in and 60 per cent for Cottage homes, 6ft and 100 per cent for Estate homes), the depth of porches, and the recommended facade material and colour. Landscaping was also strictly regulated: precise percentages are decreed for the appropriate mix of grass, hedges, shrubs and trees. The degree of variety was prescribed: 'No more than two different species of canopy trees, two different species of ornamental trees, five different species of shrubs or hedges, and four different species of ground covers.' 'No synthetic or artificial plant materials' were permitted, and no palm trees allowed in the front or side yards. The architectural patterns governed the spacing between elements (dormers, doors, porches, columns and bays), laying down additional rules about the colour of cladding material and other facade features for each of the six prescribed housing styles. For the Coastal style, all windows, trim boards, columns and railings were to be white, but were to be brown in the Mediterranean style; pale green, pale ochre or pale blue in the French; and 'a deeper shade of the body colour' in the Victorian. While there were few Celebrationites who regretted the style policing - the rules were intended to protect property values - in many instances, deviations from the Pattern Book became a matter of dispute between a homeowner and Joe Barnes, the resident town architect responsible for reviewing and approving all building and landscaping plans. If a tasteful historical precedent for a deviation could be cited, then the homeowner had a good case to present, although mutual agreements about taste were a hard target to hit in cases where the detail was inconsistent with the vision of the Pattern Book. One dispute I came across involved the veto of large glass engravings of Victorian golfers on the front door of Al and Judy Ziffer's home on Canaan Place. A precedent had been found in a real Victorian mansion, and Judy approached the dispute as 'a First Amendment issue, a question of civil liberties. If it had cost my whole bankroll for my retirement,' she declared, 'I'd have spent it.' The engravings eventually stayed on the door, though they had not met with official approval. Donna Latour reported a long series of approvals for her house on Golfpark Drive, where many of the features she wanted, including 12ft ceilings and low bay windows, were vetoed as incorrectly Victorian. Buyers whose houses have been rectified in this way closely scrutinise each new home for signs of an overly permissive review. Would anyone ever be allowed to put shutters on their Queen Anne? In the Pattern Book, the interpretation of 'Victorian' draws on the Carpenter Gothic cottage style (characterised by 'steep roof pitches with deep gables and dormers') and a style described as 'a decorated Classical box with a full width porch'. Interpretation of the Pattern Book's own definitions of historical style can be a complicated affair, and it is no surprise that the result often seems overly legalistic. Judgments about what is properly Victorian and what is not can only end up in the realm of farce, worthy of a Monty Python skit. Party time Nurturing community spirit was one of the driving forces behind Celebration. For some people, however, there is such a thing as too much community\u0085 Residents in the middle-income homes took pride in the fact that all the townsfolk, including apartment tenants, were welcome at their pot-luck parties. Those in the newer and less central neighbourhoods, which had the least expensive, detached homes, made a special effort to attract the rest of the townsfolk. It did not escape notice that residents in estate homes often had their parties catered and that the guest lists were more carefully zoned. In April, Town Hall launched its 'block party trailer' (outfitted with barbecue grills, stereo system, ice chests, hula hoops and water sprinkler games) for general use. Since every act of Town Hall was closely analysed, the chuck wagon was perceived by some as an intervention in the 'block party wars' and as a subtle invitation to keep these events non-exclusive and non-competitive. Competition aside, one block had already achieved an unsurpassable record for its pot-luck performance. On Honeysuckle - an early pioneer row with middle-range Cottage lots - the zest for neighbourliness was running far ahead of expectation. Monthly parties were slated at residents' houses almost two years in advance, and each was announced with ornate invitations. The driving force on Honeysuckle was the home team of Darlene and Fred Rapanotti, who supervised the soirees with cosy precision. Originally from Garden City on Long Island, with a 'five-and-dime on every street corner', the Rapanottis were one of the town's many (ex-) military couples, long accustomed to the regulated environments of military housing. In addition, theirs was one of the houses decorated as a teeming shrine to Disney memorabilia. Shelves, tables, and wall space were lined with figurines, pictures, and sculptures of Walt's entire entourage, including an awesome rendering of Cinderella's Castle. The Rapanotti home was also a fount of hospitality, and I was always received there with uncommon largesse. Darlene was of Chinese-American descent, and had a culinary range to match. Her no-nonsense efforts at pioneering the pot-luck circuit were justly famous and had been lovingly archived. An attendance book registered residents' comments at each event, a photograph album recorded past gatherings, and a range of invitations from each party was preserved. Darlene, who worked at Disney's Caribbean Cruise Lines, had also been active in exporting the pot-luck protocols to other neighbourhoods and had aspirations to link the several circuits together in an annual, communitywide bash. The Honeysuckle pot lucks had hosted votes on block adornments - co-ordinated Christmas decor on the mailboxes - and Darlene wanted to organise discussions on how best to represent the town to visiting journalists in hopes of dispelling the media clich\u00e9 that 'we are all mechanical puppets and Disney mannequins'. Each of the several parties I attended had its own flavour, where hosts would invite their own friends from other parts of town. One event in late summer took the form of an elaborate hay ride to the North Village. Attendance varied. There were regulars and not-so-regulars. To be sure, there were some on the block who found the monthly regimen to be a little more sociability than they cared for, and the Honeysuckle model, while admired from a distance, had set a pace that no other block in town tried to match. In some ways, it represented the tolerable upper limit of community bonding in Celebration. There were many blocks in town where neighbours, lacking willingly active organisers, preferred to socialise informally or loosely attach themselves to the party circuit of an adjoining block. If anything, the pace of community building that had been set here had resulted in partial burnout. Several pioneers acknowledged there was too little time for their own families. Religious leaders, partially in competition with the community professionals at Town Hall and the Foundation, expressed concern that overcommitment to community activity was in danger of producing dysfunctional families. In Celebration, there was such a thing as a little too much community. Besides, block solidarity was an uneasy feature of social life in a town where Town Hall encouraged residents to identify with the whole of Celebration. In his newsletter item discouraging the use of village labels, Brent Herrington, community manager at the Town Hall, warned against 'the tendency of new developments to fracture into separate districts rather than functioning as dynamic, cohesive communities'. Officially, at least, community was intended to be synonymous with the entire town, and professional help was on hand to ensure that community building kept its course. A subtle reward system was in place very early on, where especially active volunteers enjoyed the gratitude of the professionals. Each year, the Foundation handed out Community Service Awards and ran a 'Tattle Tales' section in its newsletter in which residents were encouraged to inform on their 'do-gooder' neighbours. Town Hall had established its own impromptu practice of awarding certificates for community-minded acts, and Herrington rarely missed a public opportunity to comment on 'the incredible organic juice that flows up from the residents'. There was lots of evidence of this juice, but it was still too early to say that the residential fabric had developed the truly organic texture that is the Holy Grail of nostalgic mythmakers and community management professionals alike. Community pride among Celebrationites was a heady cocktail, mixed with equal parts performance anxiety, property angst, and pioneer exuberance. Professional community management, on the other hand, had already proved itself as a well-seasoned vintage. Beyond the machinery of management, however, the battles being fought in town had fashioned community bonds that were arguably stronger than those brought on by the physical advantages of New Urban neighbourliness or the Foundation's culture of volunteerism. This was a sense of community forged out of conditions of adversity, and however much outsiders snorted at the mere idea of Celebrationites suffering, these internal struggles had worked their way into the guts of community building in ways that offered some lessons for the outside world. Stepford wives Outsiders like to compare the women of Celebration to the Stepford wives from the film of the same name - wives reduced to sexually acquiescent doormats by their husbands It's no surprise that the 'Stepford wives' label is bitterly resented among the women of Celebration. Not a few described encounters with tourists who asked them directly whether they felt like a Stepford wife. It was not always easy to separate this awareness of being typecast from normal habits of self-presentation. One remarkably independent woman, who did not seem to correspond to the stereotype in any way, confessed to me that she always 'tidied herself up' to pop down to the grocery store 'just in case a tourist took a picture' of her. She wanted to 'represent Celebration in a good light'. How did women, in general, respond to their roles in this community? In my talks with couples, I found that women were less inclined to be 'negative' in their opinions about Celebration, while their husbands often took pleasure in offering their own assessments of the community's problems. I also found that men alone were likely to speak in the first person of their decision to move here or to buy a house, although this habit was more chronic among older couples. As in Stepford, Celebration had its share of wealthy, nonworking wives, with a retinue of home helpers on call, but in many more cases, the economic challenge of moving in and keeping up with monthly payments obliged female homemakers to seek outside work. If anything, when I ran into resentment relating to gender roles, it was directed by women at the spectacle of 'idle' men around town, especially those who were wealthy enough to buy oodles of leisure time. Could a town like Celebration be construed, Stepford-like, as part of a male conspiracy to rein in the womenfolk? In this well-trodden domain of male behaviour, no such conjecture could be entirely dismissed. But it was less easy to make the case here. New Urban design is aimed, in part, at ensuring that suburban women are no longer required to serve as their children's chauffeurs or to be social prisoners in their own subdivision unit. With daycare, the school, and playgrounds all within walking distance, and with the prospect of nearby work, this environment was intended to be kinder on women's schedules than a typical suburban setting. The dream homes of postwar suburbia had been built around the gender role of domestic servitude; the highway system was constructed to meet the transportation needs of male bread-winner commuters. With the rise of the dual-income family, the pressure on women to cope with this ill-adapted environment was often linked to 'social problems' like the latchkey child, the dysfunctional family, high divorce rates, and even the erosion of middle-class security. If this compact, postsuburban town was designed to reinforce family bonds, it did so, in part, simply by making women's lives easier. In addition, the mixed-income and intergenerational makeup of the Celebration population yielded far from uniform expectations of male and female behaviour regarding work and social roles. As for the single parents - almost all women - the gruesome label of 'Stepford wife' was especially hard to stomach. Post script Thoughts on leaving town As I motored out of town for the last time, I remembered something a resident had told me.

      "body": "<p>My first lumbar near-death experience was in 1994 when I made the mistake of bending over in the bathroom to retrieve a Captain Scarlet figurine from behind the toilet. The foregoing details - which are not exactly the stuff of classical tragedy - are lost anyway in the mists of the worst pain you can possibly have. The word 'excruciating' is actually based on the Latin crux , meaning 'cross' - which is itself the ancient sign for the fourth junction of lower spine and vertebra. OK, I made that last bit up, but don't listen to anyone who tells you how much it hurts being set on fire or eaten by a shark or going into labour for 15 hours: this is the one you have to have been through. This is AAAAAAARGH! with as many capital A's as you can manage before you pass out. All else is but a twinge in the annals of plague and morbidity. </p> <p>But back to that evening in 1994. Obviously, a miniature bathroom is not the best place to keel over in agony, because there's absolutely nowhere to fall that won't make things worse. So it was a while before I identified the narrow range of possible half-crouching, chimp-like movements I could make without shrieking the roof off, inching my way to the landing where I rolled on to the floor in a pitiable foetal hunch, attempting to still my convulsing nerve-ends while I bleated for my wife. Of course she couldn't hear me, because she was busy clattering dishes while the children fought over the ownership of something none of them really wanted, so it was ages before she came up in a slightly cross mood and looked at me as though I was idling about browsing through the football results. You can't blame her. After all, the bad back has for so long been a staple of TV comic malingerers that to claim asylum from domestic duties under these auspices inevitably raises suspicions, even after you've explained that you can't actually walk. She sighed. 'You'll have to wait until I've got the kids to bed...' she said, 'and done the hoovering.' </p> <p>Eventually, Mike came round from next door and helped her to lift me on to the bed (AAAAAAARGH!), where I lay for three days, alternately holding hot-water bottles and bags of frozen peas to the affected area, peeing in a bottle and never quite being able to reach the off switch on our non-portable radio. The morning after it happened, I woke up with my head jammed up against the bedstead and my muscles in permanent spasm. I say this with no shame: you can only lie there writhing with six white-hot skewers twisting away in your spinal ganglia for so long without crying for your mother. 'Breathe,' my wife is saying, trying to get me to do those wuh-wuh exercises from antenatal classes. 'Control the pain,' she's saying. 'Don't panic,' she's saying. 'AAAAAAARGH!' (That was me.) In the end, she had to physically drag me down the bed by the legs, roll me over, and rush down to get the peas back out of the freezer. It was the worst day of my life, including the morning I got my O-level results. </p> <p>But that was then. These days, professors of lumbar discomfort advise against staying in bed for more than a day or two. Too much lying around allows your discs to dehydrate, which can set you back - well, your back back - for weeks. You should be up and about (presumably on all fours) getting on with your life - exercise to get your juices pumping; anti-inflammatory drugs to kill the pain. For most victims, lower-back pain tends to go away by itself, but we prefer to help it on its way. We prefer to have an expert on the job, kneading, manipulating, X-raying, getting the plastic skeleton out and explaining what the backbone is connected to and what a disc is exactly. The osteopaths and chiropractors and sports injuries clinics are teeming with people like you and me, standing awkwardly in their best underwear, bending this way and that, sitting glumly on the edge of the orthopaedic couch and asking: what does it all mean? So they explain: your back is a very complicated mechanism of bones and ligaments and joints and muscles and nerves, with all your other body parts weighing down on it - head, shoulders, arms, lungs, nipples. So, you see, you're already carrying all this luggage when you try to move the unmovable, reach the unreachable, twist your upper body beyond its natural twist. Something is bound to go twaaaang. Our backs haven't caught up with evolution. Back pain, the experts tell you, is the price we pay for standing on our own two feet. If the dinosaurs had been a bit brainier, they'd be the ones with slipped discs by now. It's great therapy being looked after, pummelled, advised, given exercises and stretches to perform every morning. But they can't really cure you. In the end, it's your back that makes all the painful decisions. </p> <p>Sometimes you might just get a single bout of agony, which rights itself after a few days. They call that acute. Chronic is when it doesn't go away. I don't know what I've got. Mine goes away and then comes back again, usually if I've been weeding, or sitting at a computer, or attempting to play tennis, or putting a shirt on, or eating a biscuit using the wrong muscles - so, in fact, not 'usually' anything in particular. It's a mystery. I know it's always there in the background, something that follows me around waiting for me to do the wrong thing; waiting for me to put my back into it. But I don't. I do the right thing. I support myself on the washbasin when I'm brushing my teeth; I kneel to tie my shoelaces; I crouch at the drop of a hat. The trouble is there are so many wrong things out there waiting to be done wrong that you only know about them when you wake up next morning and need help to put your socks on. You can't quite work out what it was you did yesterday that has made today such a pain in the arse - which, oddly, is where your symptoms can end up. What started out a few weeks ago as an exquisite shooting pain in my back has gradually worked its way into my buttock and down my upper thigh, where it has now pitched its camp and mounted its flag. Things have improved slightly. I'm not limping all the way to the station now; I'm not grimacing in public. I should say, too, that in all new outbreaks since 1994, the pain has never come near the hell's pitchforks of that first episode. </p> <p>I've just got back from the physio. I'm taking all the right precautions, I say. I'm sleeping with a pillow between my legs, I've given up the morning jog, I've got the children to bring me the mail. The physio is very thorough, lifting my leg until it hurts and then asking if it hurts. She's seen my X-ray from the doctor and confirms degenerative tissue in the space between the fourth and fifth vertebrae. Discs are like shock absorbers, she says, and sometimes the shock is too much and they bulge out or bits break off. 'Is that a bad thing?' I ask. 'It's pretty common,' she says. Once you're over 25, you have bits dropping off all over. 'But on the other hand,' she says, 'there are lots of people walking around with discs like that who don't have back pain at all!' Lucky them. She has me lying on my back with my leg straight up. She pushes it towards me. 'That hurt?' she says. Which it does, but only in the normal wrenched-leg way. </p> <p>The interesting thing is, she can't reproduce my symptoms simply by prodding away at my spine. In fact, I've got rather good movement for a man of my age and indolent leanings. The only way she can reproduce the pain is by putting tension on my sciatic nerve, which runs via your back, buttock and leg into your foot. So when I put my neural structure under pressure in a tight space - like driving a car or sitting at a desk - it becomes irritated and inflamed, she says. I need to do some nerve stretches, that's all! And learn how to sit and stand like a human being. She prods about a bit more. </p> <p>'I don't think the pain is coming from your discs at all,' she says finally. </p> <p>'What, I don't have a bad back?' </p> <p>'Not really.' </p> <p>I start getting dressed. 'Does that mean I'm in the wrong place?' </p> <p>Ha-ha-ha. No, she does nerves, too. </p> <p>'Come back next week,' she says. </p> <p> <strong>The lowdown on backs</strong></p> <p> <strong> Causes of back pain </strong> One of the biggest medical mysteries is why back pain occurs. Sometimes it's easy. A sudden movement damages the soft tissues, muscles, ligaments or disc areas of the back - all of which are weakened by age, inactivity and poor posture. Two or three days' worth of pain later, things clear up. In up to 10 weeks you're better, and with a little preventative body bolstering (increased fitness, better posture, etc), it should never come back. However, for many people it does - the pain never fades - and for these people, the cause may be deeper than mere injury/wear and tear. </p> <p> \u0095 The genetic link: 'Up to 60 per cent of chronic back-pain sufferers could have a genetic predisposition affecting the collagen in their discs or the way their body uses the bone-builder vitamin D,' says musculoskeletal specialist Dr John Tanner. 'This is particularly likely if back problems run in your family.' </p> <p> \u0095 The emotional link: Last year, three research studies from the Institute of Work in the US determined that there was an emotional link to back pain, with stressed workers who have little job control or satisfaction suffering more than satisfied workers. Why is still not known - it could be purely because stress increases pain perception, or that it's still more acceptable to complain of physical pain than emotional stress, or that the pain is the body's way of telling us to reassess our situation. But what is known is that only once the emotional problems are solved can the pain itself be treated effectively. </p> <p> \u0095 The dietary link: In the US, Dr Neal Barnard of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine believes high-fat diets could cause back pain. 'Finnish researchers discovered that many people with back pain suffer from blocked arteries around the spine which reduce bloodflow and cause disc degeneration,' he explains. </p> <p><strong> Getting treatment</strong> If this were a perfect world, we could tell you which expert is best for which type of back pain, but according to the General Osteopathic Council, this simply isn't possible. The truth is, experts say, that back-pain treatment is a bit of a lottery - what works for one person may not help someone else. If a correct diagnosis, the right technique and a set of muscles in a good mood all line up, you'll hit a pain-free jackpot. This is more likely to happen if you do the following: </p> <p> \u0095 Get diagnosed by a doctor. At least then you'll know if you do have back pain rather than a referred pain condition like gallstones. </p> <p> \u0095 Determine which therapy appeals. With any element of medicine there is some kind of placebo effect. Superficially, osteopaths are more muscle-focused, using stretching and other techniques to loosen areas. Chiropractors are more bone-focused and tend to reposition things with more thrusting movements. Physiotherapy is a more orthodox approach and combines massage and manipulation with higher-tech treatments like ultrasound. </p> <p> \u0095 Check qualifications. Anyone using the title osteopath must be registered with the General Osteopathic Council (020 7357 6655) and therefore be adequately qualified, or they're breaking the law. Physiotherapists should have the letters SRP (State Registered Physiotherapist) or MCSP (Member of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists) after their name and the best qualified chiropractors have a DC (Diploma in Chiropractice) and a BSc. </p> <p> \u0095 Make sure you like them. 'If you don't like them,' says physiotherapist Sammy Margo, 'you won't respond to them.' This is scientifically proven. Research on psychiatric patients discovered that those visiting a therapist with a similar personality to them responded better than those treated by an opposite personality. </p> <p> \u0095 Abide by the four-session rule. 'If you don't notice any improvement (however slight) after four sessions, quit,' says Malcolm Morrison, president of the British Institute of Musculoskeletal Medicine. </p> <p> <strong> Back facts</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 The number of people suffering from back pain has doubled every decade since the 70s. </p> <p> \u0095 One of the largest sufferer groups are those who drive more than 25,000 miles a year - the problem is the long-term sitting combined with the vibration of the vehicle. </p> <p> \u0095 Men's back pain is normally the result of sudden injury, while women's tends to be caused by long-term structural wear and tear caused by standing or sitting for long periods at work. Women's pain also tends to last longer. </p> <p> \u0095 Despite this, men take more time off work than women. Per 1,000 people, 627 'male' days are lost from work compared to 347 'female' days a year (facts taken from Beating Back Pain by John Tanner, Dorling Kindersley, \u00a38.99).</p>",

      "bodyText": "My first lumbar near-death experience was in 1994 when I made the mistake of bending over in the bathroom to retrieve a Captain Scarlet figurine from behind the toilet. The foregoing details - which are not exactly the stuff of classical tragedy - are lost anyway in the mists of the worst pain you can possibly have. The word 'excruciating' is actually based on the Latin crux , meaning 'cross' - which is itself the ancient sign for the fourth junction of lower spine and vertebra. OK, I made that last bit up, but don't listen to anyone who tells you how much it hurts being set on fire or eaten by a shark or going into labour for 15 hours: this is the one you have to have been through. This is AAAAAAARGH! with as many capital A's as you can manage before you pass out. All else is but a twinge in the annals of plague and morbidity. But back to that evening in 1994. Obviously, a miniature bathroom is not the best place to keel over in agony, because there's absolutely nowhere to fall that won't make things worse. So it was a while before I identified the narrow range of possible half-crouching, chimp-like movements I could make without shrieking the roof off, inching my way to the landing where I rolled on to the floor in a pitiable foetal hunch, attempting to still my convulsing nerve-ends while I bleated for my wife. Of course she couldn't hear me, because she was busy clattering dishes while the children fought over the ownership of something none of them really wanted, so it was ages before she came up in a slightly cross mood and looked at me as though I was idling about browsing through the football results. You can't blame her. After all, the bad back has for so long been a staple of TV comic malingerers that to claim asylum from domestic duties under these auspices inevitably raises suspicions, even after you've explained that you can't actually walk. She sighed. 'You'll have to wait until I've got the kids to bed...' she said, 'and done the hoovering.' Eventually, Mike came round from next door and helped her to lift me on to the bed (AAAAAAARGH!), where I lay for three days, alternately holding hot-water bottles and bags of frozen peas to the affected area, peeing in a bottle and never quite being able to reach the off switch on our non-portable radio. The morning after it happened, I woke up with my head jammed up against the bedstead and my muscles in permanent spasm. I say this with no shame: you can only lie there writhing with six white-hot skewers twisting away in your spinal ganglia for so long without crying for your mother. 'Breathe,' my wife is saying, trying to get me to do those wuh-wuh exercises from antenatal classes. 'Control the pain,' she's saying. 'Don't panic,' she's saying. 'AAAAAAARGH!' (That was me.) In the end, she had to physically drag me down the bed by the legs, roll me over, and rush down to get the peas back out of the freezer. It was the worst day of my life, including the morning I got my O-level results. But that was then. These days, professors of lumbar discomfort advise against staying in bed for more than a day or two. Too much lying around allows your discs to dehydrate, which can set you back - well, your back back - for weeks. You should be up and about (presumably on all fours) getting on with your life - exercise to get your juices pumping; anti-inflammatory drugs to kill the pain. For most victims, lower-back pain tends to go away by itself, but we prefer to help it on its way. We prefer to have an expert on the job, kneading, manipulating, X-raying, getting the plastic skeleton out and explaining what the backbone is connected to and what a disc is exactly. The osteopaths and chiropractors and sports injuries clinics are teeming with people like you and me, standing awkwardly in their best underwear, bending this way and that, sitting glumly on the edge of the orthopaedic couch and asking: what does it all mean? So they explain: your back is a very complicated mechanism of bones and ligaments and joints and muscles and nerves, with all your other body parts weighing down on it - head, shoulders, arms, lungs, nipples. So, you see, you're already carrying all this luggage when you try to move the unmovable, reach the unreachable, twist your upper body beyond its natural twist. Something is bound to go twaaaang. Our backs haven't caught up with evolution. Back pain, the experts tell you, is the price we pay for standing on our own two feet. If the dinosaurs had been a bit brainier, they'd be the ones with slipped discs by now. It's great therapy being looked after, pummelled, advised, given exercises and stretches to perform every morning. But they can't really cure you. In the end, it's your back that makes all the painful decisions. Sometimes you might just get a single bout of agony, which rights itself after a few days. They call that acute. Chronic is when it doesn't go away. I don't know what I've got. Mine goes away and then comes back again, usually if I've been weeding, or sitting at a computer, or attempting to play tennis, or putting a shirt on, or eating a biscuit using the wrong muscles - so, in fact, not 'usually' anything in particular. It's a mystery. I know it's always there in the background, something that follows me around waiting for me to do the wrong thing; waiting for me to put my back into it. But I don't. I do the right thing. I support myself on the washbasin when I'm brushing my teeth; I kneel to tie my shoelaces; I crouch at the drop of a hat. The trouble is there are so many wrong things out there waiting to be done wrong that you only know about them when you wake up next morning and need help to put your socks on. You can't quite work out what it was you did yesterday that has made today such a pain in the arse - which, oddly, is where your symptoms can end up. What started out a few weeks ago as an exquisite shooting pain in my back has gradually worked its way into my buttock and down my upper thigh, where it has now pitched its camp and mounted its flag. Things have improved slightly. I'm not limping all the way to the station now; I'm not grimacing in public. I should say, too, that in all new outbreaks since 1994, the pain has never come near the hell's pitchforks of that first episode. I've just got back from the physio. I'm taking all the right precautions, I say. I'm sleeping with a pillow between my legs, I've given up the morning jog, I've got the children to bring me the mail. The physio is very thorough, lifting my leg until it hurts and then asking if it hurts. She's seen my X-ray from the doctor and confirms degenerative tissue in the space between the fourth and fifth vertebrae. Discs are like shock absorbers, she says, and sometimes the shock is too much and they bulge out or bits break off. 'Is that a bad thing?' I ask. 'It's pretty common,' she says. Once you're over 25, you have bits dropping off all over. 'But on the other hand,' she says, 'there are lots of people walking around with discs like that who don't have back pain at all!' Lucky them. She has me lying on my back with my leg straight up. She pushes it towards me. 'That hurt?' she says. Which it does, but only in the normal wrenched-leg way. The interesting thing is, she can't reproduce my symptoms simply by prodding away at my spine. In fact, I've got rather good movement for a man of my age and indolent leanings. The only way she can reproduce the pain is by putting tension on my sciatic nerve, which runs via your back, buttock and leg into your foot. So when I put my neural structure under pressure in a tight space - like driving a car or sitting at a desk - it becomes irritated and inflamed, she says. I need to do some nerve stretches, that's all! And learn how to sit and stand like a human being. She prods about a bit more. 'I don't think the pain is coming from your discs at all,' she says finally. 'What, I don't have a bad back?' 'Not really.' I start getting dressed. 'Does that mean I'm in the wrong place?' Ha-ha-ha. No, she does nerves, too. 'Come back next week,' she says. The lowdown on backs Causes of back pain One of the biggest medical mysteries is why back pain occurs. Sometimes it's easy. A sudden movement damages the soft tissues, muscles, ligaments or disc areas of the back - all of which are weakened by age, inactivity and poor posture. Two or three days' worth of pain later, things clear up. In up to 10 weeks you're better, and with a little preventative body bolstering (increased fitness, better posture, etc), it should never come back. However, for many people it does - the pain never fades - and for these people, the cause may be deeper than mere injury/wear and tear. \u0095 The genetic link: 'Up to 60 per cent of chronic back-pain sufferers could have a genetic predisposition affecting the collagen in their discs or the way their body uses the bone-builder vitamin D,' says musculoskeletal specialist Dr John Tanner. 'This is particularly likely if back problems run in your family.' \u0095 The emotional link: Last year, three research studies from the Institute of Work in the US determined that there was an emotional link to back pain, with stressed workers who have little job control or satisfaction suffering more than satisfied workers. Why is still not known - it could be purely because stress increases pain perception, or that it's still more acceptable to complain of physical pain than emotional stress, or that the pain is the body's way of telling us to reassess our situation. But what is known is that only once the emotional problems are solved can the pain itself be treated effectively. \u0095 The dietary link: In the US, Dr Neal Barnard of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine believes high-fat diets could cause back pain. 'Finnish researchers discovered that many people with back pain suffer from blocked arteries around the spine which reduce bloodflow and cause disc degeneration,' he explains. Getting treatment If this were a perfect world, we could tell you which expert is best for which type of back pain, but according to the General Osteopathic Council, this simply isn't possible. The truth is, experts say, that back-pain treatment is a bit of a lottery - what works for one person may not help someone else. If a correct diagnosis, the right technique and a set of muscles in a good mood all line up, you'll hit a pain-free jackpot. This is more likely to happen if you do the following: \u0095 Get diagnosed by a doctor. At least then you'll know if you do have back pain rather than a referred pain condition like gallstones. \u0095 Determine which therapy appeals. With any element of medicine there is some kind of placebo effect. Superficially, osteopaths are more muscle-focused, using stretching and other techniques to loosen areas. Chiropractors are more bone-focused and tend to reposition things with more thrusting movements. Physiotherapy is a more orthodox approach and combines massage and manipulation with higher-tech treatments like ultrasound. \u0095 Check qualifications. Anyone using the title osteopath must be registered with the General Osteopathic Council (020 7357 6655) and therefore be adequately qualified, or they're breaking the law. Physiotherapists should have the letters SRP (State Registered Physiotherapist) or MCSP (Member of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists) after their name and the best qualified chiropractors have a DC (Diploma in Chiropractice) and a BSc. \u0095 Make sure you like them. 'If you don't like them,' says physiotherapist Sammy Margo, 'you won't respond to them.' This is scientifically proven. Research on psychiatric patients discovered that those visiting a therapist with a similar personality to them responded better than those treated by an opposite personality. \u0095 Abide by the four-session rule. 'If you don't notice any improvement (however slight) after four sessions, quit,' says Malcolm Morrison, president of the British Institute of Musculoskeletal Medicine. Back facts \u0095 The number of people suffering from back pain has doubled every decade since the 70s. \u0095 One of the largest sufferer groups are those who drive more than 25,000 miles a year - the problem is the long-term sitting combined with the vibration of the vehicle. \u0095 Men's back pain is normally the result of sudden injury, while women's tends to be caused by long-term structural wear and tear caused by standing or sitting for long periods at work. Women's pain also tends to last longer. \u0095 Despite this, men take more time off work than women. Per 1,000 people, 627 'male' days are lost from work compared to 347 'female' days a year (facts taken from Beating Back Pain by John Tanner, Dorling Kindersley, \u00a38.99).",

Scottish Widows started selling the more flexible type of policy about five years ago. You could always buy a new endowment with the proceeds when your policy matures but - because you are older, and particularly if your health has deteriorated - you will find this is more expensive.

      "body": "<p> 'I am an idiot. I am! A complete and utter idiot.' Hugh Laurie stretches his long, thin face, bringing a rubbery expression of astonishment to it; he turns down his lips; his brows corrugate; his electric-blue, blazing eyes boggle. He does make himself look a creditable idiot, or a lanky schoolboy caught in a spasm of acute self-consciousness. He calls himself berk, fraud, twit. He uses words like blimey and gosh and oh heck, like a blathering fool from an antique issue of Boy's Own . 'Joke,' he says apologetically as soon as he makes one, anxious lest I miss it. 'Sorry,' he says at the end of long sentences, staring at me helplessly, 'sorry I'm talking such tosh, such twaddle; I know I must be disappointing you.' Then he half-covers his sad-fool mouth with a hand, as if to stop any more treacherous words escaping. It should be annoying, this hectic English ruefulness. It should be a kind of disguised vanity. It isn't. </p> <p>'The secret is out. He's a great actor, our new Cary Grant or Tom Hanks,' says Ben Elton, who has just directed him in his own directorial debut, Maybe Baby, casting Laurie against the apparent grain of his acting talent as the romantic lead. </p> <p>'He is very loveable,' says Emma Thompson, who was, many years ago, his girlfriend, and has been his friend for two decades. 'He is one of those rare people who manages to be lugubriously sexy, like a well-hung eel.' </p> <p>'He's a remarkable man to know,' says his great friend Stephen Fry. 'I owe him everything. He's the real thing. Gifted, phenomenally intelligent, and wise.' </p> <p>'And he's beautiful,' says Ben Elton. </p> <p>'Yes,' says Joely Richardson, who plays opposite him in Maybe Baby . 'Hugh is mysterious, and very beautiful.' </p> <p>'Blimey!' says Laurie, stretching his beautiful eyes until they look as if they will pop out, grimacing wildly. 'Gosh!' </p> <p>But it is true. When Hugh Laurie stops pulling the face of amiable fool, his own face is beautiful: gaunt, vulnerable, tender, sweet, strangely haunted. And although it may be hard to imagine him playing the lead in a romantic comedy, it's difficult, once you've seen him doing it, to remember this is his first shot at doing it. Maybe Baby is the story of Sam and Lucy, who are happy in love, successful at work (he's a TV commissioning editor, she a theatrical agent), surrounded by friends. But they cannot make a baby, no matter how enthusiastically they try. The high spirits of the opening scenes - sexy underwear, acupuncture, intercourse along the ley lines - present a familiar Hugh Laurie, the rueful Englishman with the turned-down smile and high-rise eyebrows making quips between the sheets. Gradually, the pleasure recedes with the onset of sperm tests and hormonal injections. Unable to create at work, Sam finally breaks his writer's block by betraying Lucy and turning their story into a TV drama. Things fall apart, and the comedy becomes a tale of loss. Here is a new Laurie, letting himself stand still and quiet, not hiding behind the gestures, grief-struck and unravelling. 'Amazing despair,' agrees Emma Thompson, who also appears in the film. 'But that's very much part of Hugh - an existential despair.' </p> <p>When we meet, he says that he found it hard, indeed 'almost unbearable', to watch himself in Maybe Baby. When takes of the film were played back on the monitor, he would put his head in his hands. He never watches himself, he says. He hates to read articles about himself ('interviews, they steal your soul, your identity, your privacy - so you can just make stuff up if you want'). He can't bear the sound of his own voice. 'Inside your head, your voice is interesting; it goes up and down and is full of light and shade and emotion. When you hear it, though, it's uh it's horrible. Retarded.' Difficult for an actor, I suggest, to hate the look of his face and the sound of his voice. He seems surprised: 'Don't most people think that of themselves? Unless they are exceptionally attractive. Most of us, though, don't we wince at how far short we fall from the picture we have of ourselves?' Self-mocking voice: 'Blimey, I thought those trousers looked good on me.' </p> <p>Ben Elton, who has known Hugh Laurie for nearly 20 years, cast him in Maybe Baby because 'I always felt with Hugh that there was a secret waiting to be let out. He thinks a great deal. He is not good at selling himself. Of course he's terrific at comedy, playing the amiables and idiots, but those who know him well - and not that many do - know that as well as doubt and insecurity he has great inner strength; huge depth and thoughtfulness. When I asked him to play Sam, he was all: \"Blimey, Ben! Do you think I can do it?\" But when I looked at him through the camera, the vulnerability was heartbreaking. He is a complicated fellow, and really quite special.' </p> <p>Joely Richardson also calls him special. 'I met him during 101 Dalmatians. I was sort of fascinated by him; I found him mysterious. There is a lot more to him than comedy - though he is brilliant at that, he has comic timing no amount of money can buy. Ben had to fight to have Hugh as his leading man; it was a risk. And Hugh, he didn't feel he deserved to be there. He was very nervous. But as an actor he was also hugely brave. He bares his soul at the end of the film. So it was a risk absolutely worth taking, for both of them. </p> <p>'Hugh has this heartbreaking quality. When his face is still, the pathos is extraordinary. There are two sides to him. There's the Hugh who dances around and cracks jokes, tangos all over the place. And there's the other side: tortured, dark. I love them both.' </p> <p>Laurie says he was very apprehensive before the film about acting grief, and afterwards he was 'very shaken. I felt as if I'd had a near-miss in a car crash. I was physically shaking. Thing is, I've never trained as an actor. I've got no diploma in acting out grief. I don't know the \"normal\" way to do it.' He drinks a slurp of coffee and stares past me. ' The Unbearable Lightness of Being, that's a good title, don't you think?' he asks, unexpectedly. 'This is the big struggle. Is the object to care utterly, or not to care at all? Should I access grief, as they put it, and trust the camera will see that, so if I'm feeling something truthful, that will emerge? Or am I going for the lightness of grief? Do I just have to resemble grief, represent it, and not let myself be filled with it? It's like that famous example in Marathon Man, with Laurence Olivier saying to Dustin Hoffman: \"You should try acting, dear boy, it's an awful lot easier.\"' </p> <p>Which was he, then, heavy or light? He lights the first of many cigarettes, after he has courteously asked my permission. 'The truth is, I don't know. I don't know what I would do again if I had to. I've not trained in this job, acting. I don't feel like an actor. What does an actor feel like? Not like me, anyway.' </p> <p>Instead, he says, he feels like a tree - or like the little bit of bark on the tree - which has been struck by lightning. (Has lightning struck your tree, they say in Hollywood, meaning the electric dazzle of fame.) Hugh Laurie is, to anyone looking at his life from the outside, a success. He grimaces every time this word is said; luck, he says, it has only been a matter of luck. He grew up the youngest son of a GP. He went to the Dragon School, Eton, where he dreamed of being an action man, a policeman, an actor. Then to Cambridge to study anthropology, where he won a blue in rowing and was president of Footlights, and got a third. He met Emma Thompson here, and Stephen Fry and Tony Slattery. He was part of the Cambridge Footlights that won the 1981 Perrier Award at Edinburgh, and which he then took to the BBC in 1982. He met Ben Elton and was in Blackadder. He is the Fry of Fry and Laurie . The Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster. The star in the forthcoming Stuart Little, a comic tale about a mouse, that is a huge hit in America. He has written a best-selling, critically acclaimed novel. He has close friends, a good marriage with his wife Jo, three beloved children (Charlie, Bill, Rebecca). He has money, security, affection, a future that looks bright and steady. </p> <p>'Yes.' He pulls a contrite face. 'I've been lucky. The lightning has struck my tree.' Of course, the trouble with luck is that it can end. You have no control over it. The 'luckier' Laurie is, the more scared he becomes. Life is thin ice. He's skated over it so far, but underneath are dark waters. And the other trouble with luck is that you don't deserve it. Hugh Laurie feels unworthy. </p> <p>He wishes, he says, that he had a prison story to tell, like Stephen Fry has. Instead, his story is 'timid, dull, middle-class'. He grew up in a comfortable family, six years younger than his next sibling, a brother to whom he wasn't particularly close. He was 'loved and cared for. Lovely parents, lovely sisters and brothers. But I was sort of an only child, because I was so much the youngest. Sort of alone.' He did, though, have 'problems' with his mother, 'and she with me. I was an awkward and frustrating child. She had very high expectations of me. Long after I had stopped being a child, I heard from my sisters that I was the apple of her eye, her golden boy, but I didn't realise it at the time. I knew she had high expectations, which I constantly disappointed.' He says that he cheated in French tests, smoked in the school loos, moved his lips when he read; his school reports were 'desperate'. 'I was lazy. I lied. About everything, all the time. I was a fussy eater. Once Mum caught me with two pieces of liver in my pocket and sent me back to the table to eat it. It took three hours and then I caved in. I gave up on the piano - that was a battle I won. I went on hunger strike and didn't eat for three days.' He makes one of his faces: 'It's still not a prison story, is it? I'm terribly jealous of Stephen Fry for his theatrically bad childhood.' </p> <p>Not a prison story, but Laurie clearly had periods of quite intense unhappiness as a boy. 'However, I've never been convinced,' he adds, 'that happiness is the object of the game. I'm wary of happiness. It is' - ironic tone here - 'a snare and a delusion. It's jolly nice sometimes, like steak and chips, but is it a goal?' He stops for a minute and puts his head on one side, considering. 'I have the luxury of asking something like that, of course. Because I can eat steak and chips whenever I want, and my life is secure and, well, \"happy\". Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I'm so, so sorry to be talking such a load of tosh. I may have to go out and punch a policeman. Do a bit of porridge.' </p> <p>After Eton - where, says Fry, Laurie could never have been a natural Etonian - he went to Cambridge. Emma Thompson met him in their first term. 'He was a rowing blue. Gigantic. I first saw him when we were auditioning for parts in the pantomime Aladdin. He looked a bit like Indiana Jones, wearing a lot of khaki. I saw him sitting there and I jabbed my friend in the ribs and said: \"Star. Star. Star!\" I knew at once. He sat on the stage and did an impression of the Emperor of China trying to attract someone's attention - it was extremely funny and clever. He was always so funny, the funniest person I've met. I remember once driving back from some Footlights performance, and hearing on the radio that somebody had been kidnapped and driven off in a Ford van. We were in a Ford van, so Hugh did a lot of struggling and thrashing around on the front seat, to see if we would be stopped. And I laughed so much I had to stop for a wee.' </p> <p>Fry also met him at Cambridge. Indeed, he says that meeting Laurie 'was the best thing that could have happened to me, both in career terms and emotionally. He is absolutely my best friend. People sometimes call me a Renaissance man, but I'm not and Hugh is. He's a natural athlete. He's a gifted musician. He is clever, perceptive, has natural charisma. Sometimes it is thought that I'm the loud mouth and the dominant one, but we have been an equal partnership. And we have not been jealous of each other - I'm genuinely thrilled when good things happen for him. And I'm particularly thrilled by the way his acting career is going.' </p> <p>And his writing career, for Laurie has also, like Fry, written a novel, The Gun Seller. He is working, he says with a wide, anxious grimace, on his next one now. He does a kind of browbeating act about the writing: Gosh, how do I dare? But his publisher, Tom Weldon of Michael Joseph, insists that he is 'unusually talented in many different ways, but in 50 years' time, I think he'll be known for his fiction. He's a complete perfectionist, and very tough on himself, almost too tough on himself, but this means his books are written with incredible care. His writing is clever, intricate and at times joyous, and I am very proud to be his publisher.' </p> <p>Real depression - 'heavyweight unhappiness' - began in his late teens and has continued through success, marriage, fatherhood. Maybe it is a chemical imbalance, he says, though he won't take drugs for it (once, he admits shamefacedly, he did resort to St John's Wort). He hates the idea of drugs that will alter him - and anyway, is not convinced that he wants to be altered. He wouldn't mind having 'a life that I like', but at the same time admits to sometimes clinging to his unhappiness, which is a known, familiar state; part of what makes him Hugh Laurie. ('But then,' he wags a long finger at me, 'who is Hugh Laurie? Aha!') He is anxious when talking of his depression, because he is so conscious that he has 'nothing at all to complain about'. He shrivels his nose. 'Perhaps that's my problem - where is the struggle? There has been no struggle. Where's the passion of my life? Where is its purpose?' He answers himself almost at once: 'Having children, that's my purpose. I am eternally in my children's debt. They stop me thinking about other stuff.' (Fry puts it the other way round, saying that his friend is the best father he's ever met.) 'I have thought of killing myself when things got really bad,' he continues, 'but I was dwelling too much on the conversations that would be had at my funeral for it to be convincing. \"That'll show them.\"' </p> <p>Show whom, though? 'Aha!' He looks triumphant. 'Who? Nobody, of course. I'm nobody's victim. I can't remotely feel sorry for myself. In fact, I'm riding for a fall, don't you think? I've had a few slips, but I've had no falls, have I? And the slips were all of my own making. My own stupid, stupid blunders.' </p> <p>So we talk of the 'slips'. First of all, Hugh Laurie feels that he has not risked enough in his life. 'I've not been tested. I remember hearing Enoch Powell interviewed, and his big regret was that he would have liked to have died in the war. I understood what he meant - that feeling of unworthiness, to continue to survive and enjoy the fruits of a victory that others die for. I'm of a different generation, but I still feel that unworthiness. I feel huge emotion when I think of the war - especially of the First World War. All those boys going down together to the recruiting office. How endlessly tragic. Whatever grand thing they were doing it for, I've not made the most of, have I? What is freedom? The freedom to eat ravioli at three in the morning? Not enough, is it?' </p> <p>When I speak to Emma Thompson, she picks up on this yearning of Laurie's to prove himself. 'There are men around, fortyish, like Sebastian Faulks, say, who would do wonderfully well at war. Hugh definitely belongs to that generation. Maybe something like war would have solved his feeling of unworthiness, but there isn't one for him, thank God.' </p> <p>And Fry, who has faced his own dark nights, says that comedians are maybe cursed with a lucidity about the world and 'therefore a clarity about themselves. So perhaps we torment ourselves. Comedy, even when it's surreal, draws attention to the absolute and the particular. You take something big and make it concrete. It can be scary.' </p> <p>Laurie tells me how, for his 40th birthday last year, his wife gave him a parachute jump. He trained for it, but when the day came, the wind was too high and they couldn't do it. The women in the group were upset, the men relieved. 'Us blokes, we were all there because we felt in some pathetic way we wanted to be tested, to know what it is like when the guy opens the door and says, \"Jump!\", and you jump. Could I do it?' </p> <p>You're scared of failure, I ask. 'Yes!' He is emphatic. Very scared. 'Very, very.' </p> <p>Because you've never failed? 'Perhaps. Perhaps I am so conceited I dare not risk failure. Or perhaps I dread it just because I know it will happen.' His blue eyes brighten. 'Call me a conceited pessimist.' </p> <p>His other slip - which we approach tentatively - is that a few years ago he had an affair with the director Audrey Cooke when he was filming The Place of Lions in Australia, and was outed by the tabloids ('Hugh in Love Tug over Blonde!'). Being Hugh Laurie, the affair was not just a fling while in another continent, and being Hugh Laurie - married to a wife he loves, father of three children he adores - his guilt is still considerable. He says that 'there is nothing to say that will make it better for anyone, so it is better not to say anything. The public exposure was an agent in the whole process; it didn't just show what happened, it affected it.' He adds hastily, 'I'm really not saying \"poor me\" here. It was all my fault. And I was shocked by what happened. The pain. Everyone's pain. I'm nervous of saying, in a facile way, that it has changed me. I can't just say, \"Oh I'm fine now\" - that sounds like a man who's about to start drinking again.' </p> <p>Change, he says, is very hard for anyone. Until last year, he was in therapy. He began when he realised that he was bored even by dangerous things like driving racing cars. The world was flat, stale. He stopped because he went away for work, but he will probably return again pretty soon: 'Not because I am in dire need still, but because my therapist is an extremely nice, bright woman and I find it a fascinating process.' His eyebrows shoot up and his blue eyes bulge. 'Did I really say that? Listen to me. \"Fascinating process.\" God, I make myself sick sometimes.' Being willing to have therapy means that theoretically Laurie does believe that it is possible for him to change, 'but actually I feel that I have just got older. Nothing does much good. I still hold out the hope that I will find ways of dealing with people that are better. More honest. In the meantime, I am just older.' </p> <p>Part of this reason for feeling older, though not much wiser, is that both his parents have now died and he is on 'the front line' or 'the top floor'. 'I'm the next to jump, in fact. Yes, I will make that jump in the end. Though I'm the youngest in my family and there are other people before me. Not before me, as in to die before me,' he adds hurriedly, 'but before me in age and wisdom. I can ask for help and advice. Though it is not like having parents, is it? Do I miss them? Yes. Except the funny thing is that I don't miss their company, since I was so separate from them for such a long time. I went to boarding school at an early age, and once you leave home like that, things are never the same again. No, what I miss is the knowledge that they are there. </p> <p>'My father, a lovely man, died a few years ago when I was in the States. I knew he was unwell, and before I went I made a deliberate decision not to resolve things, not to have that final conversation. I didn't say goodbye and have the big talk. Because,' he says, 'I didn't want to give him my permission to leave. I wanted him to have unfinished business, as if resolving things would somehow be unlucky. I guess I was scared to let him clear the in-tray. I regret that now, but probably I would do the same again.' </p> <p>Nor did he have any kind of resolution with his mother, who died when he was 29 of motor neurone disease; the woman who expected so much of him and whom he felt he constantly disappointed; who probably gave to her golden boy his debilitating self-doubt, his dread of competition, his fear of love and risk, his endearing vulnerability. 'No, no resolution, not at all. Or maybe very, very slightly. A small amount of movement.' He holds up his thumb and forefinger in measurement. 'Maybe two inches.' Two inches along what road, I ask. 'Oh,' he grins savagely. 'Say, two inches along half a mile.' </p> <p>Laurie's self-deprecation goes very deep. He continually cracks scathing jokes about himself, makes gargoyle grimaces at his own words. He calls this behaviour his 'default system'. Fry believes that he is terrified of being seen to be cocky. 'He'll sit at the piano and pull silly faces rather than allowing your attention to be drawn to his brilliant playing. God knows we all feel unworthy, but he feels it more than most. He knows he is lucky, but he can never take that for granted. There are some people from working-class backgrounds who treat people like shit because they've come so far. They don't need to prove themselves. Hugh is more likely to be apologetic. He's a seriously emotional soul.' </p> <p>His friends get annoyed with him for so underselling himself. 'His extreme deprecation is his only really annoying habit,' says Fry. Thompson agrees: 'He is surrounded by people who love him passionately and have spent a good part of their adult lives saying, \"Hugh, you are marvellous.\" He is the most infuriating and the most wonderful of people. He, of course, would say yes to being infuriating and no to being wonderful. And the infuriating thing about him is that he won't accept he's fantastic. I don't know if the paradox will ever be answered now. Probably it never will be.' </p> <p>He is clearly well-loved. He is clearly very loveable. Nobody has a bad word to say about him, so he provides the bad words himself. 'I am an idiot.' He has no enemies, so he becomes his own self-wounding enemy. 'Blimey, I'm a fool.' </p> <p>\u0095 Maybe Baby is released nationwide on 2 June</p>",

Should I access grief, as they put it, and trust the camera will see that, so if I'm feeling something truthful, that will emerge? Or am I going for the lightness of grief? Do I just have to resemble grief, represent it, and not let myself be filled with it? It's like that famous example in Marathon Man, with Laurence Olivier saying to Dustin Hoffman: \"You should try acting, dear boy, it's an awful lot easier.\"' Which was he, then, heavy or light? He lights the first of many cigarettes, after he has courteously asked my permission. 'The truth is, I don't know. I don't know what I would do again if I had to. I've not trained in this job, acting. I don't feel like an actor. What does an actor feel like? Not like me, anyway.' Instead, he says, he feels like a tree - or like the little bit of bark on the tree - which has been struck by lightning. (Has lightning struck your tree, they say in Hollywood, meaning the electric dazzle of fame.) Hugh Laurie is, to anyone looking at his life from the outside, a success. He grimaces every time this word is said; luck, he says, it has only been a matter of luck. He grew up the youngest son of a GP. He went to the Dragon School, Eton, where he dreamed of being an action man, a policeman, an actor. Then to Cambridge to study anthropology, where he won a blue in rowing and was president of Footlights, and got a third. He met Emma Thompson here, and Stephen Fry and Tony Slattery. He was part of the Cambridge Footlights that won the 1981 Perrier Award at Edinburgh, and which he then took to the BBC in 1982. He met Ben Elton and was in Blackadder. He is the Fry of Fry and Laurie . The Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster. The star in the forthcoming Stuart Little, a comic tale about a mouse, that is a huge hit in America. He has written a best-selling, critically acclaimed novel. He has close friends, a good marriage with his wife Jo, three beloved children (Charlie, Bill, Rebecca). He has money, security, affection, a future that looks bright and steady. 'Yes.' He pulls a contrite face. 'I've been lucky. The lightning has struck my tree.' Of course, the trouble with luck is that it can end. You have no control over it. The 'luckier' Laurie is, the more scared he becomes. Life is thin ice. He's skated over it so far, but underneath are dark waters. And the other trouble with luck is that you don't deserve it. Hugh Laurie feels unworthy. He wishes, he says, that he had a prison story to tell, like Stephen Fry has. Instead, his story is 'timid, dull, middle-class'. He grew up in a comfortable family, six years younger than his next sibling, a brother to whom he wasn't particularly close. He was 'loved and cared for. Lovely parents, lovely sisters and brothers. But I was sort of an only child, because I was so much the youngest. Sort of alone.' He did, though, have 'problems' with his mother, 'and she with me. I was an awkward and frustrating child. She had very high expectations of me. Long after I had stopped being a child, I heard from my sisters that I was the apple of her eye, her golden boy, but I didn't realise it at the time. I knew she had high expectations, which I constantly disappointed.' He says that he cheated in French tests, smoked in the school loos, moved his lips when he read; his school reports were 'desperate'. 'I was lazy. I lied. About everything, all the time. I was a fussy eater. Once Mum caught me with two pieces of liver in my pocket and sent me back to the table to eat it. It took three hours and then I caved in. I gave up on the piano - that was a battle I won. I went on hunger strike and didn't eat for three days.' He makes one of his faces: 'It's still not a prison story, is it? I'm terribly jealous of Stephen Fry for his theatrically bad childhood.' Not a prison story, but Laurie clearly had periods of quite intense unhappiness as a boy. 'However, I've never been convinced,' he adds, 'that happiness is the object of the game. I'm wary of happiness. It is' - ironic tone here - 'a snare and a delusion. It's jolly nice sometimes, like steak and chips, but is it a goal?' He stops for a minute and puts his head on one side, considering. 'I have the luxury of asking something like that, of course. Because I can eat steak and chips whenever I want, and my life is secure and, well, \"happy\". Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I'm so, so sorry to be talking such a load of tosh. I may have to go out and punch a policeman. Do a bit of porridge.' After Eton - where, says Fry, Laurie could never have been a natural Etonian - he went to Cambridge. Emma Thompson met him in their first term. 'He was a rowing blue. Gigantic. I first saw him when we were auditioning for parts in the pantomime Aladdin. He looked a bit like Indiana Jones, wearing a lot of khaki. I saw him sitting there and I jabbed my friend in the ribs and said: \"Star. Star. Star!\" I knew at once. He sat on the stage and did an impression of the Emperor of China trying to attract someone's attention - it was extremely funny and clever. He was always so funny, the funniest person I've met. I remember once driving back from some Footlights performance, and hearing on the radio that somebody had been kidnapped and driven off in a Ford van. We were in a Ford van, so Hugh did a lot of struggling and thrashing around on the front seat, to see if we would be stopped. And I laughed so much I had to stop for a wee.' Fry also met him at Cambridge. Indeed, he says that meeting Laurie 'was the best thing that could have happened to me, both in career terms and emotionally. He is absolutely my best friend. People sometimes call me a Renaissance man, but I'm not and Hugh is. He's a natural athlete. He's a gifted musician. He is clever, perceptive, has natural charisma. Sometimes it is thought that I'm the loud mouth and the dominant one, but we have been an equal partnership. And we have not been jealous of each other - I'm genuinely thrilled when good things happen for him. And I'm particularly thrilled by the way his acting career is going.' And his writing career, for Laurie has also, like Fry, written a novel, The Gun Seller. He is working, he says with a wide, anxious grimace, on his next one now. He does a kind of browbeating act about the writing: Gosh, how do I dare? But his publisher, Tom Weldon of Michael Joseph, insists that he is 'unusually talented in many different ways, but in 50 years' time, I think he'll be known for his fiction. He's a complete perfectionist, and very tough on himself, almost too tough on himself, but this means his books are written with incredible care. His writing is clever, intricate and at times joyous, and I am very proud to be his publisher.' Real depression - 'heavyweight unhappiness' - began in his late teens and has continued through success, marriage, fatherhood. Maybe it is a chemical imbalance, he says, though he won't take drugs for it (once, he admits shamefacedly, he did resort to St John's Wort). He hates the idea of drugs that will alter him - and anyway, is not convinced that he wants to be altered. He wouldn't mind having 'a life that I like', but at the same time admits to sometimes clinging to his unhappiness, which is a known, familiar state; part of what makes him Hugh Laurie. ('But then,' he wags a long finger at me, 'who is Hugh Laurie? Aha!') He is anxious when talking of his depression, because he is so conscious that he has 'nothing at all to complain about'. He shrivels his nose. 'Perhaps that's my problem - where is the struggle? There has been no struggle. Where's the passion of my life? Where is its purpose?' He answers himself almost at once: 'Having children, that's my purpose. I am eternally in my children's debt. They stop me thinking about other stuff.' (Fry puts it the other way round, saying that his friend is the best father he's ever met.) 'I have thought of killing myself when things got really bad,' he continues, 'but I was dwelling too much on the conversations that would be had at my funeral for it to be convincing. \"That'll show them.\"' Show whom, though? 'Aha!' He looks triumphant. 'Who? Nobody, of course. I'm nobody's victim. I can't remotely feel sorry for myself. In fact, I'm riding for a fall, don't you think? I've had a few slips, but I've had no falls, have I? And the slips were all of my own making. My own stupid, stupid blunders.' So we talk of the 'slips'. First of all, Hugh Laurie feels that he has not risked enough in his life. 'I've not been tested. I remember hearing Enoch Powell interviewed, and his big regret was that he would have liked to have died in the war. I understood what he meant - that feeling of unworthiness, to continue to survive and enjoy the fruits of a victory that others die for. I'm of a different generation, but I still feel that unworthiness. I feel huge emotion when I think of the war - especially of the First World War. All those boys going down together to the recruiting office. How endlessly tragic. Whatever grand thing they were doing it for, I've not made the most of, have I? What is freedom? The freedom to eat ravioli at three in the morning? Not enough, is it?' When I speak to Emma Thompson, she picks up on this yearning of Laurie's to prove himself. 'There are men around, fortyish, like Sebastian Faulks, say, who would do wonderfully well at war. Hugh definitely belongs to that generation. Maybe something like war would have solved his feeling of unworthiness, but there isn't one for him, thank God.' And Fry, who has faced his own dark nights, says that comedians are maybe cursed with a lucidity about the world and 'therefore a clarity about themselves. So perhaps we torment ourselves. Comedy, even when it's surreal, draws attention to the absolute and the particular. You take something big and make it concrete. It can be scary.' Laurie tells me how, for his 40th birthday last year, his wife gave him a parachute jump. He trained for it, but when the day came, the wind was too high and they couldn't do it. The women in the group were upset, the men relieved. 'Us blokes, we were all there because we felt in some pathetic way we wanted to be tested, to know what it is like when the guy opens the door and says, \"Jump!\", and you jump. Could I do it?' You're scared of failure, I ask. 'Yes!' He is emphatic. Very scared. 'Very, very.' Because you've never failed? 'Perhaps. Perhaps I am so conceited I dare not risk failure. Or perhaps I dread it just because I know it will happen.' His blue eyes brighten. 'Call me a conceited pessimist.' His other slip - which we approach tentatively - is that a few years ago he had an affair with the director Audrey Cooke when he was filming The Place of Lions in Australia, and was outed by the tabloids ('Hugh in Love Tug over Blonde!'). Being Hugh Laurie, the affair was not just a fling while in another continent, and being Hugh Laurie - married to a wife he loves, father of three children he adores - his guilt is still considerable. He says that 'there is nothing to say that will make it better for anyone, so it is better not to say anything. The public exposure was an agent in the whole process; it didn't just show what happened, it affected it.' He adds hastily, 'I'm really not saying \"poor me\" here. It was all my fault. And I was shocked by what happened. The pain. Everyone's pain. I'm nervous of saying, in a facile way, that it has changed me. I can't just say, \"Oh I'm fine now\" - that sounds like a man who's about to start drinking again.' Change, he says, is very hard for anyone. Until last year, he was in therapy. He began when he realised that he was bored even by dangerous things like driving racing cars. The world was flat, stale. He stopped because he went away for work, but he will probably return again pretty soon: 'Not because I am in dire need still, but because my therapist is an extremely nice, bright woman and I find it a fascinating process.' His eyebrows shoot up and his blue eyes bulge. 'Did I really say that? Listen to me. \"Fascinating process.\" God, I make myself sick sometimes.' Being willing to have therapy means that theoretically Laurie does believe that it is possible for him to change, 'but actually I feel that I have just got older. Nothing does much good. I still hold out the hope that I will find ways of dealing with people that are better. More honest. In the meantime, I am just older.' Part of this reason for feeling older, though not much wiser, is that both his parents have now died and he is on 'the front line' or 'the top floor'. 'I'm the next to jump, in fact. Yes, I will make that jump in the end. Though I'm the youngest in my family and there are other people before me. Not before me, as in to die before me,' he adds hurriedly, 'but before me in age and wisdom. I can ask for help and advice. Though it is not like having parents, is it? Do I miss them? Yes. Except the funny thing is that I don't miss their company, since I was so separate from them for such a long time. I went to boarding school at an early age, and once you leave home like that, things are never the same again. No, what I miss is the knowledge that they are there. 'My father, a lovely man, died a few years ago when I was in the States. I knew he was unwell, and before I went I made a deliberate decision not to resolve things, not to have that final conversation. I didn't say goodbye and have the big talk. Because,' he says, 'I didn't want to give him my permission to leave. I wanted him to have unfinished business, as if resolving things would somehow be unlucky. I guess I was scared to let him clear the in-tray. I regret that now, but probably I would do the same again.' Nor did he have any kind of resolution with his mother, who died when he was 29 of motor neurone disease; the woman who expected so much of him and whom he felt he constantly disappointed; who probably gave to her golden boy his debilitating self-doubt, his dread of competition, his fear of love and risk, his endearing vulnerability. 'No, no resolution, not at all. Or maybe very, very slightly. A small amount of movement.' He holds up his thumb and forefinger in measurement. 'Maybe two inches.' Two inches along what road, I ask. 'Oh,' he grins savagely. 'Say, two inches along half a mile.' Laurie's self-deprecation goes very deep. He continually cracks scathing jokes about himself, makes gargoyle grimaces at his own words. He calls this behaviour his 'default system'. Fry believes that he is terrified of being seen to be cocky. 'He'll sit at the piano and pull silly faces rather than allowing your attention to be drawn to his brilliant playing. God knows we all feel unworthy, but he feels it more than most. He knows he is lucky, but he can never take that for granted. There are some people from working-class backgrounds who treat people like shit because they've come so far. They don't need to prove themselves. Hugh is more likely to be apologetic. He's a seriously emotional soul.' His friends get annoyed with him for so underselling himself. 'His extreme deprecation is his only really annoying habit,' says Fry. Thompson agrees: 'He is surrounded by people who love him passionately and have spent a good part of their adult lives saying, \"Hugh, you are marvellous.\" He is the most infuriating and the most wonderful of people. He, of course, would say yes to being infuriating and no to being wonderful. And the infuriating thing about him is that he won't accept he's fantastic. I don't know if the paradox will ever be answered now. Probably it never will be.' He is clearly well-loved. He is clearly very loveable. Nobody has a bad word to say about him, so he provides the bad words himself. 'I am an idiot.' He has no enemies, so he becomes his own self-wounding enemy. 'Blimey, I'm a fool.' \u0095 Maybe Baby is released nationwide on 2 June",

He would like to do a number of things with his money, but can't decide on priorities. </p> <p>He graduated from university just over two years ago and like most ex-students, still has debts. He has managed to pay off more than half of the \u00a32,500 overdraft he had when he finished studying and recently moved his account to a bank that offers a large interest-free overdraft on graduate accounts. </p> <p>Stephen is paying back the Student Loan Company at \u00a3150 a month, but is not sure whether this is a good idea. 'As these student loans are low interest, would it perhaps be better to reduce my payments to the minimum of \u00a380 a month and use the other \u00a370 for something else.' </p> <p>The something else includes buying a car and buying a home. At present Stephen gets about using public transport and begging lifts from friends. But he lives in the country and is about to take his driving test, so will probably want a car fairly soon. </p> <p>Stephen has saved \u00a32,800 in a cash Isa with this purpose in mind, though he now wonders whether he would do better with a graduate loan from his bank (HSBC) for the car. He could then use the Isa money as a deposit for a house. At present Stephen is in rented accommodation, but feels he should get a foot on the property ladder. 'It seems to be impossible to save fast enough to keep up with rising house prices.' Indeed he wonders whether property should take priority over buying a car. He points out that he could get a 100 per cent graduate mortgage from his bank. </p> <p>The company Stephen works for (which employs 130 staff) is starting a pension scheme in September, to which he will contribute 5 per cent of his salary. He thinks the company will also contribute 5 per cent. </p> <p>At the same time as wanting to make sound financial decisions, Stephen does not want to miss out on the excitement of investing in shares. So instead of clearing his \u00a31,000 interest-free overdraft, he is considering using some money to invest in telecoms shares, which he feels he knows something about due to the nature of his work. He has already opened a trading account with online broker E*trade. He intends to buy shares in a couple of companies and hold them for, say, two years. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Martin Jones</strong> </p> <p>Stephen has graduated with significant debts, but these are all at favourable rates of interest and repaying them should not be his priority. </p> <p>The interest on the Student Loans Company debt is effectively equal to inflation. Graduate overdrafts at nil interest are an even more attractive form of borrowing, but I suspect that at some stage these loans will revert to the bank's normal rate of interest, so he should be ready to repay these then. In the meantime, he should maximise his cash flow by repaying the minimum \u00a380 per month to the Student Loans Company. </p> <p>Someone living in semi-rural Dorset must need a car, and Stephen should budget to buy one soon. Buying a small car would allow him to take advantage of the cheaper road tax for small cars. </p> <p>He may be able to get a 100 per cent graduate mortgage from his bank, but he should check this does not involve a mortgage indemnity guarantee (MIG) premium - a penalty charged by lenders where a high percentage of the property's value is borrowed. If this was added to the mortgage Stephen would be in negative equity. With a 100 per cent mortgage he may also find it difficult to sell without taking a capital loss. </p> <p>If he does decide to buy a property, he should look for one for less than \u00a360,000, so as to avoid paying stamp duty of 1 per cent on the whole purchase price. He should definitely join his employer's pension scheme, but given his debts it is best to avoid buying shares for now. </p> <p><em>Martin Jones works for chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg. </em></p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Gordon Wilson</strong></p> <p>Stephen has been very prudent, taking advantage of his bank's enlightened attitude to graduates. He has reduced the cost of his debt where possible, and is using the ideal vehicle for short-term, tax-free saving, a cash mini-Isa. </p> <p>I think he should invest in property before buying a car. Buying a property close to work or somewhere with good public transport would reduce the immediate need for a car. Buying property first would give him a clear idea of how much he has left for a car. </p> <p>A flexible mortgage would allow Stephen to reduce his mortgage debt as he goes along, but increase it if he wanted to buy a car. This way he would have a car loan at mortgage interest rates. </p> <p>Stephen also needs to consider his future career.

Also, the \u00a36,000 you receive in free shares will compensate for all but the most dramatic fall in value of the stake you pay for yourself, Cassidy points out. </p> <p>'There is an element of risk, but this is still a fantastic offer,' he says. </p> <p>The second catch is more of a problem. Investors who keep shares granted through the new scheme for at least five years will pay no income tax or national insurance on their holdings. But capital gains tax (CGT) will potentially be payable on profits from selling the shares after that, just as it is with SAYE schemes. </p> <p>The CGT problem is particularly acute for members of SAYE schemes, where the acquisition cost of shares is deemed to be the price at which you are given the option to receive them. In the new scheme, the base cost of your shares will be their price on the day they emerge from the plan, which for most people is after five years. So if you sell your shares straight away, there will be no tax to pay. </p> <p>Many investors will make sizable contributions to employee share ownership schemes and will accrue large profits on shares that they retain. It will be vital to minimise tax when you realise these gains. </p> <p>The good news is that the Chancellor has effectively cut the rate of CGT on profits from shares granted through employee share ownership schemes. These shares now count as business assets, thus qualifying for generous taper relief announced in the Budget. It cuts the taxable proportion of a capital gain: the longer you hold an asset, the more relief you get. The effective rate of CGT on shares granted through employee ownership plans has fallen to 10 per cent on sales made after four years or more. </p> <p>However, to minimise your CGT bill you need to consider carefully when to sell such shares. In the new plans, investors will have to hold them for at least five years to avoid income tax, so they should qualify for the maximum level of taper relief. </p> <p>\u0095 The new all-employee share ownership scheme will enable employers to offer shares in three ways.

To this add the cost of a stethoscope (\u00a365 to \u00a3125 ), an ophthalmoscope (\u00a3110 to \u00a3150) and white coats at \u00a325 each. You will also have to pay for the exams to become a member of the Royal College of your choice. </p> <p>Part 1 exams for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health cost about \u00a3210, while part 2 exams cost \u00a3460. </p> <p><strong> Starting salary:</strong> \u00a317,260 as a house officer. </p> <p><strong> Salary and position after 10 years:</strong> You may still be a specialist registrar, earning \u00a330,670 to \u00a335,080. But you could be a consultant on \u00a348,905, an associate specialist on \u00a328,995 plus, staff grade on \u00a326,150 to \u00a334,710, or a GP on an average of \u00a354,220. </p> <p><strong> Career pros and cons:</strong> To quote several doctors, the money is rubbish for the amount of training, hours and stress involved. In the early years you can expect to be used and abused. However, many doctors find this is more than compensated for by a high level of job satisfaction. </p> <p><strong> Veterinary science</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Academic qualifications: </strong> High grades in chemistry and other sciences or maths at A level, followed by a veterinary degree.Courses last five years except at Cambridge, where it lasts six. </p> <p><strong> Cost during education:</strong> Cost covered by LEAs for British students, but expect to pay around \u00a3600 for overalls, white coats, steel capped wellies, medical equipment and books. </p> <p><strong> Starting salary:</strong> \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000 in a mixed country practice. </p> <p><strong> Salary and position after 10 years:</strong> An experienced assistant can earn up to \u00a340,000. </p> <p><strong> Career pros and cons: </strong> There are a few wealthy vets, but this is a career you do for love, not money. </p> <p><strong> Public relations </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Academic qualifications: </strong> Degree preferable. </p> <p><strong> Cost during education:</strong> No extra costs. </p> <p><strong> Starting salary:</strong> \u00a318,000 as an account executive in an agency, or \u00a312,000 as an assistant or administrator in a in-house press office. </p> <p><strong> Salary and position after 10 years:</strong> A director of an agency would expect to earn from \u00a335,000 in a small two-man band to \u00a3500,000 at a big City firm. The average falls between \u00a360,000 and \u00a380,000. An in-house PR may be a head of department, earning about \u00a3100,000 in London. </p> <p><strong> Career pros and cons:</strong> Intellectually challenging and financially rewarding. </p> <p><strong> Law - barrister</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Academic qualifications: </strong> You need a good 2nd class or 1st class degree. If you've taken a non-law degree, you must take the one year Common Professional Examination (CPE), followed by the one year Bar Vocational Course. You then apply for a pupilage in a set of chambers, consisting of six months non-practising and six months of handling cases. </p> <p><strong> Cost during education:</strong> The CPE costs from \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000, and the Bar Vocational Course \u00a36,000. </p> <p><strong> Starting salary</strong>: Depending on which chambers you are attached to, you are likely to be paid during your pupilage (anything from \u00a312,000 to \u00a325,000). A first-year tenant can expect to earn \u00a317,000 plus. </p> <p><strong> Salary and position after 10 years:</strong> Figures compiled by BDO Stoy Hayward show that the average earnings range is from \u00a361,200 to \u00a3124,300 for barristers with 10-years-plus experience. But this depends very much on the type of work. </p> <p><strong> Career pros and cons:</strong> Provided you pick the right branch of law, you can earn a great deal of money. However, persuading your clients to actually pay is a different matter, and barristers are not allowed to sue for outstanding money. </p> <p><strong> Law - solicitor</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Academic qualifications: </strong> A good 2nd class or 1st class degree. If you've taken a non-law degree, you must take a one-year course leading to the Common Professional Examination (CPE). This is followed by the one year Legal Practice Course (LPC). If you have taken a law degree, you can skip the CPE but must take the LPC.</p> <p><strong> Cost during education:</strong> The CPE costs from \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000, and the LPE about \u00a34,000. No student loans are available. </p> <p><strong> Starting salary:</strong> The legal minimum for trainees on their two-year articles is \u00a310,000 a year.

Earning potential is very good - some partners in City firms have clocked up more than \u00a31m a year </p> <p> <strong> Civil engineering </strong></p> <p><strong> Academic qualifications:</strong> Reasonable A Levels or equivalent.

The work is varied and challenging, often involving long hours during critical phases. All sectors admit to a shortage of good graduates. </p> <p><strong> IT</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Academic qualifications required</strong> : Science and maths A level, a degree - not necessarily computer sciences but one that carries some computer studies. </p> <p><strong> Cost during education:</strong> No extra costs. </p> <p><strong> Starting salary:</strong> About \u00a320,000 for an IRT developer, more for someone going into e-commerce. </p> <p><strong> Salary and position after 10 years</strong> : About \u00a3100,000 as an IT project manager or contractor. </p> <p><strong> Career pros and cons:</strong> The market for IT specialists is extremely strong and well paid at the moment. Working on contract is lucrative, but ultimately your career could be limited - companies will not pay for you to train on new systems. </p> <p><strong> Journalism</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Academic qualifications: </strong> Most editors will look for a degree plus an National Council for the Training of Journalists course or post graduate diploma. To get on these courses you have to show a real commitment to journalism by spending time working for your college paper, local paper or radio station. </p> <p><strong> Cost during education:</strong> A one year NCTJ course (for people at A level standard) costs about \u00a31,000, while a 20-week fast track course for postgraduate costs from \u00a3500 to \u00a3600. Cardiff's one-year post graduate diploma costs \u00a33,790 while City University charges \u00a33,550. Very few grants are available for the post graduate course. Most people apply instead for career development loans. </p> <p><strong> Starting salary:</strong> \u00a311,000 on a local paper, and about \u00a325,000 on a national. </p> <p><strong> Salary and position after 10 years:</strong> Anything from \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000 as a senior reporter or features writer on a local paper. About \u00a340,000 as a reporter on a national, up to about \u00a3160,000 as a columnist or \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3300,000 as an editor. </p> <p><strong> Career pros and cons:</strong> You are likely to cover a wide variety of subjects and meet many different types of people, including those who wield considerable power. Getting a scoop gives a real buzz. However, forget any ideas about glamour. And there is no job security, especially on the nationals. </p> <p><strong> Accountancy</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Academic qualifications required</strong>: A levels or equivalent, although 92 per cent of trainee accountants are graduates - each accountancy firm will have its own requirements. You apply to firms for a training contract, which lasts a minimum of three years and maximum of five. In the first year you are expected to sit professional exams. In your final year you do the advanced stage, which takes the form of a written case study. Either before or after the advanced stage, you must also take a test of advanced technical competence. </p> <p><strong> Cost during education: </strong> No extra costs. </p> <p><strong> Starting salary:</strong> First year trainees last year were paid an average of \u00a314,500, while those in London earned an average of \u00a316,500. In your first year as a qualified chartered account you can expect to earn from \u00a325,000 to \u00a328,000. </p> <p><strong> Salary and position after 10 years:</strong> Someone who has remained in practice could be a salaried or equity partner of the firm, earning in excess of \u00a3100,000. </p> <p><strong> Career pros and cons:</strong> The training process and exams are intensely boring, and trainees are treated as auditing fodder to be despised and maltreated by company in-house accounting staff. The culture of the profession tends to be quite narrow minded. On the positive side, if you are joining a large firm there are likely to be many trainees around your age, providing an instant social life. Once you've qualified, the money is good, and if you switch into business your progression up your company is likely to be fast. </p> <p><strong> Investment banking</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Academic qualifications:</strong> A good degree, 2.1 or higher. </p> <p><strong> Cost during education:</strong> No extra costs. </p> <p><strong> Starting salary:</strong> About \u00a320,000. </p> <p><strong> Salary and position after 10 years:</strong> You could easily be on a salary of \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3200,000, and bonuses do, in some cases, push remuneration to over \u00a31 million. </p> <p><strong> Career pros and cons: </strong> Bonuses are not guaranteed - they depend on the profits made by the bank or investment firm during that year, and your portion of the bonus fund depends on your position, your performance and the regard your boss has for you. Traders and analysts start at 7am - not for night owls. Other areas of investment banking can involve extremely long and unsociable hours. On the plus side, you can derive a lot of satisfaction from seeing your ideas being put into action. And let's not forget the money! </p> <p><strong> Fund management</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Academic qualifications:</strong> A degree and possibly an MBA. </p> <p><strong> Cost during education:</strong> No extra costs. </p> <p><strong> Starting salary:</strong> About \u00a322,000 (as a trainee analyst or researcher). </p> <p><strong> Salary and position after 10 years:</strong> A fund manager, handling institutional and retail money, typically earns between \u00a370,000 and \u00a380,000, plus a bonus based on the fund management company's annual profit. The bonus often equals the basic salary. </p> <p><strong> Career pros and cons:</strong> You are treated as a senior at a very junior level. The trainee analyst goes on to become a fully fledged analyst, who will have access to the chief executives and finance directors of major companies, and they will take you seriously because you have a lot of power over the money invested in their business. Compared with other forms of investment banking, the hours are quite regular. However, fund managers are judged entirely on their performance, and their failure can be very high profile.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Medicine Academic qualifications: High grades in sciences (chemistry is particularly important), followed by a five or six year degree in medicine and surgery. Cost during education: Larger overdraft for a five or six year degree. To this add the cost of a stethoscope (\u00a365 to \u00a3125 ), an ophthalmoscope (\u00a3110 to \u00a3150) and white coats at \u00a325 each. You will also have to pay for the exams to become a member of the Royal College of your choice. Part 1 exams for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health cost about \u00a3210, while part 2 exams cost \u00a3460. Starting salary: \u00a317,260 as a house officer. Salary and position after 10 years: You may still be a specialist registrar, earning \u00a330,670 to \u00a335,080. But you could be a consultant on \u00a348,905, an associate specialist on \u00a328,995 plus, staff grade on \u00a326,150 to \u00a334,710, or a GP on an average of \u00a354,220. Career pros and cons: To quote several doctors, the money is rubbish for the amount of training, hours and stress involved. In the early years you can expect to be used and abused. However, many doctors find this is more than compensated for by a high level of job satisfaction. Veterinary science Academic qualifications: High grades in chemistry and other sciences or maths at A level, followed by a veterinary degree.Courses last five years except at Cambridge, where it lasts six. Cost during education: Cost covered by LEAs for British students, but expect to pay around \u00a3600 for overalls, white coats, steel capped wellies, medical equipment and books. Starting salary: \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000 in a mixed country practice. Salary and position after 10 years: An experienced assistant can earn up to \u00a340,000. Career pros and cons: There are a few wealthy vets, but this is a career you do for love, not money. Public relations Academic qualifications: Degree preferable. Cost during education: No extra costs. Starting salary: \u00a318,000 as an account executive in an agency, or \u00a312,000 as an assistant or administrator in a in-house press office. Salary and position after 10 years: A director of an agency would expect to earn from \u00a335,000 in a small two-man band to \u00a3500,000 at a big City firm. The average falls between \u00a360,000 and \u00a380,000. An in-house PR may be a head of department, earning about \u00a3100,000 in London. Career pros and cons: Intellectually challenging and financially rewarding. Law - barrister Academic qualifications: You need a good 2nd class or 1st class degree. If you've taken a non-law degree, you must take the one year Common Professional Examination (CPE), followed by the one year Bar Vocational Course. You then apply for a pupilage in a set of chambers, consisting of six months non-practising and six months of handling cases. Cost during education: The CPE costs from \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000, and the Bar Vocational Course \u00a36,000. Starting salary: Depending on which chambers you are attached to, you are likely to be paid during your pupilage (anything from \u00a312,000 to \u00a325,000). A first-year tenant can expect to earn \u00a317,000 plus. Salary and position after 10 years: Figures compiled by BDO Stoy Hayward show that the average earnings range is from \u00a361,200 to \u00a3124,300 for barristers with 10-years-plus experience. But this depends very much on the type of work. Career pros and cons: Provided you pick the right branch of law, you can earn a great deal of money. However, persuading your clients to actually pay is a different matter, and barristers are not allowed to sue for outstanding money. Law - solicitor Academic qualifications: A good 2nd class or 1st class degree. If you've taken a non-law degree, you must take a one-year course leading to the Common Professional Examination (CPE). This is followed by the one year Legal Practice Course (LPC). If you have taken a law degree, you can skip the CPE but must take the LPC. Cost during education: The CPE costs from \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000, and the LPE about \u00a34,000. No student loans are available. Starting salary: The legal minimum for trainees on their two-year articles is \u00a310,000 a year. At the other extreme, trainees in City law firms may start on \u00a320,000. Salary and position after 10 years: \u00a325,000 to \u00a345,000 if working for a small-town firm concentrating on family law and legal aid work, to \u00a390,000 to \u00a3150,000 for the salaried partner of a City firm. Career pros and cons: A career that offers a massive range of experiences. Earning potential is very good - some partners in City firms have clocked up more than \u00a31m a year Civil engineering Academic qualifications: Reasonable A Levels or equivalent. A 3-year BEng is the benchmark for an Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a 4-year MEng for a Member. Costs during education: No extra costs. Starting salary: \u00a312,500 to \u00a321,000, sometimes with added benefits. Salary &amp; position after 10 years: \u00a320,000 - \u00a350, 000 dependent on ambition and ability. Career pros and cons: Civil engineers aim to balance aspirations for ever-increasing prosperity and the trappings of a civilised life against the conservation of resources and protection of the environment. This means they make a real difference to people's lives. The work is varied and challenging, often involving long hours during critical phases. All sectors admit to a shortage of good graduates.

These days however, like many women, I can understand why periods are nicknamed 'the curse': they can make a significant portion of your life utterly miserable. It's hardly surprising that the majority of menopausal women report their relief at having stopped menstruating. Indeed, this is why some resist taking hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), because, depending on the type of drug prescribed, HRT can prolong the years during which they have to endure menstrual bleeding.</p> <p>One of the main reasons women dread their 'time of the month' is the pain, which may force them to spend days off work lying in bed, clutching a hot-water bottle and feeling dopey from the side-effects of strong painkillers. Nor does age always bring relief: despite assurances from many doctors that the passage of time lessens the pain, it can be just as bad - and sometimes worse - as you grow older. Child bearing doesn't necessarily make any difference either. Painful periods should always be investigated in case you have an underlying medical problem, but if you're given the all-clear and told that you will simply have to live with it, it's worth reviewing your diet. Although food won't necessarily render your period pain-free, numerous women whom I've treated have found that making basic alterations to their diets can lessen their menstrual trauma.</p> <p>Scientific studies carried out over the past few years have found that women whose diet is low in fish seem to suffer more from period pain. Oily fish in particular have an essential role to play in alleviating menstrual pain. These fish contain an omega-3 fatty acid which both helps the body to produce natural, painkilling substances and reduces inflammation within the uterus by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandin PG2 alpha, a hormone-like compound that stimulates the uterine muscles. Eating at least one portion of oily fish, such as a couple of sardines, once a day on the three and four days leading up to menstruation can make period pain more bearable.</p> <p>Further studies have also shown that following a diet low in fat and rich in fresh fruit and vegetables, high-fibre foods and lean proteins can significantly reduce menstrual problems. As well as hindering the action of omega-3 fatty acids, butter and other animal fats restrict the potentially beneficial effects of gamma linoleic acid, another fatty acid that can help to regulate your body's production of prostaglandins and thus reduce period pain. Gamma linoleic acid is found in the oil of evening primrose, an essential oil that you can buy in several strengths. Many women experience significant relief from period pain when they take evening primrose oil on a regular basis, but if you suffer from an underlying medical condition, consult your doctor before taking it. Similarly, although some herbalists recommend that women with period pain take cramp bark (Viburnum opulus), black haw (Viburnum prunifolium) and white peony (Paeonia lactiflora), consult a qualified herbal practitioner before trying them yourself. </p> <p>You can also enlist the aid of vitamins and minerals in the battle to overcome debilitating menstrual pain. Vitamin E appears to reduce pain by encouraging the body to produce endorphins (commonly known as 'happy hormones'), which can work to banish pain. Foods rich in vitamin E include nuts, seeds, avocados, blackberries, mangoes, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, watercress and wholegrain cereals. Because it also helps to regulate prostaglandin synthesis, magnesium is another pain-buster that is found in wholegrain products, brown rice, nuts and seeds, green, leafy vegetables, okra, peas, sweetcorn, courgettes, yogurt, dried apricots, raisins and bananas. </p> <p>Conveniently, all of the above-mentioned foods also contain vitamin B6 (as does milk), which works to maximise the transfer of magnesium to the cells of the uterine muscle. Nature therefore enables us to absorb and metabolise beneficial nutrients from food, which is a much healthier and tastier option than resorting to vitamin or mineral supplements.</p> <p>In order to glean the optimum benefits from these foods, start eating them during the week before your period starts and for the first few days of bleeding. If you still suffer from period pain, remember that warmth frequently reduces muscular cramps, so try snuggling up with a hot-water bottle, relaxing in a warm bath or sipping a warm, soothing drink. It's best to brew a herbal infusion when you have period pain, as drinks containing caffeine can make uterine inflammation worse and disrupt your body's absorption and metabolism of essential vitamins and minerals, such as iron, whose levels may drop during your period through blood loss. </p> <p>There is also some evidence to suggest that women who have iron-deficiency anaemia suffer particularly badly from menstrual pain, so if you suspect that your body's iron levels are low, ask your doctor for a blood test. If this is found to be the case, you may be advised to boost your intake of iron-rich foods, such as lean red meats, pulses and dark green, leafy vegetables. In addition, because rapid weight loss has been shown to exacerbate pain, steer clear of crash diets, and try to adopt a healthy-eating lifestyle, a strategy that will stand you in good stead, whether or not you are menstruating.</p>",

You may fall into the group of driven people who, according to psychologist Professor Cary Cooper, love to work and play at the same time. 'Because they have an infrastructure around them - the mobile and the laptop - they can relax and work at the same time. But if it interferes with your significant others on holiday, it's bad.' </p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Understand that colleagues left behind compare you with the people who stand in for you. If you rule with a rod of iron, there will be sustained celebrations. Even if you are popular, expect some new approach to arise which works better than your way of doing things. </p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Appreciate the sad truth that cowardly bosses often sack people when they are out of the workplace. The holiday season is an ideal firing time because they don't have to look you in the eye. It was no coincidence that Mikhail Gorbachev was toppled when he was at his country cottage in August. Make preparations: take home copies of useful memos, buttress your relationships with allies and hone your contacts list. </p>",

If you work with incompetents, make sure you leave written notes (and keep copies) about what to do when you are away. 4. Try not to take your laptop and mobile to the beach with you. You may fall into the group of driven people who, according to psychologist Professor Cary Cooper, love to work and play at the same time. 'Because they have an infrastructure around them - the mobile and the laptop - they can relax and work at the same time. But if it interferes with your significant others on holiday, it's bad.' 5. Understand that colleagues left behind compare you with the people who stand in for you. If you rule with a rod of iron, there will be sustained celebrations. Even if you are popular, expect some new approach to arise which works better than your way of doing things. 6. Appreciate the sad truth that cowardly bosses often sack people when they are out of the workplace. The holiday season is an ideal firing time because they don't have to look you in the eye. It was no coincidence that Mikhail Gorbachev was toppled when he was at his country cottage in August. Make preparations: take home copies of useful memos, buttress your relationships with allies and hone your contacts list.",

What is less clear is whether this is a temporary fad, and how widely it will extend into the workplace. </p> <p>City firms such as Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston have adopted a less formal dress code in recent months; and accountant Arthur Andersen announced in January its 7,000 UK staff would be free to wear whatever they wanted - within reason. Paul Clark, Andersen's spokesman, says: 'We thought our people would think better and work better if they felt more comfortable with what they were wearing.' </p> <p>Since the new policy was introduced, he says, around 50 per cent of staff have continued to wear formal suits, while the rest have opted for a more casual look. If an employee has a meeting with a client, they are expected to wear what they consider appropriate, he says, and the company has the confidence that they will judge wisely. </p> <p>The laissez faire approach to dress at Andersen was introduced partly at the prompting of its corporate identity consultant, Enterprise IG, whose sales and marketing director Simon Williams says it is not a PR gesture. 'It's something the staff have asked for, and they think it's absolutely fantastic,' he says. He believes that the move to more casual attire is being driven by people working for global businesses, who are rejecting the formal dress of their own country in favour of a more relaxed, international look. </p> <p>Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, has his own theory about how the move to casual work dress has come about. 'There are people working in consultancies and technology businesses who want to emulate the look of the whiz-kid American businessman. What they don't realise is that Americans have their own uniform; it's not pinstripe suits, but it's brown trousers, blazer, button-down shirt and striped tie.' </p> <p>He says that in the UK, the suit and tie has become endangered because it is identified with the Old Economy, and nobody wants to be seen as out of touch. But it remains to be seen whether the more casual look - 'smart casual' as it is often described - will percolate out to the workplace as a whole. </p> <p>Even if open-necked shirts and polo-necked sweaters ever catch on with middle management, Cooper believes that retailers and banks will be reluctant to allow their customer-facing staff to adopt such casual garb. 'I think the management will worry that some of the people won't get it right,' he says. </p> <p>And there is scepticism about dressing down from other quarters. Johnnie Boden, former City banker and founder of the Boden mail order catalogue, says: 'Men are fundamentally pretty unimaginative creatures. For years they thought they were enslaved to dull suits, but now they are facing this great conundrum: what to wear?' </p> <p>And Hugh Holland, managing director of Saville Row tailor Kilgour French &amp; Stanbury, says: 'A suit is designed to enhance your good parts, and hide your bad parts. Casual clothing is non-structural; if you're a fat slob, then you look like a fat slob when you wear it.' </p> <p>He believes that buyers of tailored suits will continue to want to look smart, and thinks the decline in sales of ready-to-wear suits has as much to do with post-millennial angst and the weaker stock market as it has to do with the New Economy. </p> <p>On one thing, all are agreed: talk of a new dress code is basically a Man Thing. 'There was a period when women first entered men's jobs when they wore pinstripe suits,' says Cooper. 'Then they entered a phase when they simply wore what was appropriate. Women have always dressed for the occasion, and they've always been more socially sensitive and adaptable.' </p> <p>Johnnie Boden agrees that women have long shaken off the shackles of formal dress at work, but he predicts that for men, flirting with casual garb may be a short-lived affair. 'In some of these companies, you will find that somebody will make a complete horlicks of it, get it completely wrong, and then they'll say: let's go back to wearing suits.' </p> <p><strong>Style counsel: How to go casual without looking naff</strong></p> <p><strong>Don't</strong> confuse casual with scruffy. A pair of jeans with fraying knees or an unironed shirt will simply make you look like the office scarecrow, and will tell colleagues that, at heart, you're just a slob.</p> <p><strong>Don't</strong> wear a tie with jeans or combat trousers. Some men think this is dressing down; but actually you'll look like a stiff-neck desperately trying to look relaxed.</p> <p><strong>Don't</strong> rely on designer labels. It'll cost you a small fortune, and is no substitute for developing you own style. Besides, half your colleagues will probably be none the wiser.</p> <p><strong>Don't</strong> dress too flamboyantly. The object is to look well-groomed and relaxed, but efficient and worthy of respect. If you turn up decked from head to toe in silver lam\u00e9, people will assume you've come straight from a night out on the tiles at Annabel's.</p> <p><strong>Do</strong> choose clothes that flatter your figure. Suits - both men's and women's - are designed to do just that, while jeans and T-shirts can show your contours at their worst.</p> <p><strong>Do</strong> spend money on your dress-down kit. If you're going to wear it for a good proportion of your working life, you need to invest. It's no use trying to make your weekend garb last twice as long.</p> <p><strong>Do</strong> wear a suit without a tie. A lounge suit - not double-breasted - with a plain cotton shirt can make men look extremely cool.</p> <p><strong>Do</strong> focus on accessories. A pair of smart loafers, or a Dunhill briefcase, can be a subtle way of telling the world that, for all your casual attire, you are to be taken seriously.</p>",

The object is to look well-groomed and relaxed, but efficient and worthy of respect. If you turn up decked from head to toe in silver lam\u00e9, people will assume you've come straight from a night out on the tiles at Annabel's. Do choose clothes that flatter your figure. Suits - both men's and women's - are designed to do just that, while jeans and T-shirts can show your contours at their worst. Do spend money on your dress-down kit. If you're going to wear it for a good proportion of your working life, you need to invest. It's no use trying to make your weekend garb last twice as long. Do wear a suit without a tie. A lounge suit - not double-breasted - with a plain cotton shirt can make men look extremely cool. Do focus on accessories. A pair of smart loafers, or a Dunhill briefcase, can be a subtle way of telling the world that, for all your casual attire, you are to be taken seriously.",

      "body": "<p>For all their well-honed marketing skills, the money managers at Jupiter Asset Management would have to concede that the birth of their baby, Jupiter Global Technology unit trust, has not gone entirely to plan. The fund was launched on 1 March, just weeks before technology stocks began to tumble. Investors, who put \u00a3132 million into the issue, saw the value of stocks fall from a starting price of 50p to 35p at the end of last week. </p> <p>Yet most independent advisers agree that technology remains one of the best prospects for long-term investment. Brian Ashford-Russell, head of the technology team at Henderson Investors, which manages the best-selling Henderson Global Technology unit trust, says the fund - which can be held in an Isa - fell by 35 per cent from its peak price, but has come back to within 20 per cent of that peak. Investors who bought as recently as October are still looking at a gain of almost 100 per cent. </p> <p>Ashford-Russell says it would be premature to rule out further falls in technology shares, and admits prices for some stocks in particular had got out of hand. 'The shares that had risen fastest fell the most sharply.' But he says US technology stocks have already made a better recovery than their European counterparts, and he is planning to increase his North American holdings to about 60 per cent of the fund. </p> <p>First-quarter results from some US technology companies - especially cyclical companies such as semiconductor manufacturers - have been 'extraordinarily' strong, says Ashford-Russell, providing a good outlook for the year. But he cautions against expecting a repeat of 1999's dazzling performance, when \u00a3100 invested in January grew to \u00a3282 by December. 'Last year was an aberration. Investors should really be looking for percentage returns in the low- to mid-twenties,' he says. </p> <p>Henderson Global Technology and Aberdeen Technology were both set up in the early Eighties and are the longest-running technology funds. But there has been a spate of launches in recent months from managers such as Jupiter, M&amp;G, Fidelity and Gartmore. For investors, what was once a fairly simple choice has become more complicated. </p> <p>Funds such as Framlington's NetNet and Sarasin's Webs@r offer specific exposure to the Internet, while Close Brothers offers a tracker fund for the UK's new TechMark index. </p> <p>Generally speaking, these funds have fared worse in the recent correction than globally focused technology funds, which usually have a higher exposure in North America. Mark Dampier, head of investment at IFA Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'In the UK and Europe, technology shares are probably more overvalued. There is far less supply, but the same level of demand.' </p> <p>Dampier singles out Aberdeen Technology as a fund which has shown consistent commitment to investment in the sector over many years, and has not allowed a fund manager to dent its performance. But he thinks Jupiter's new fund should not be written off. 'I'd want to wait another month to see how well they're really doing,' he says. </p> <p>Some investors in technology funds rushed to cancel their cheques when the market fell at the beginning of April, but Dampier believes they were shortsighted. He advocates that those considering an investment now should drip their money in, and take advantage of any further price falls to increase their holding. </p> <p>The flood of new technology funds may well slow to a trickle now that the sector has taken a knock. But few advisers will be telling their clients to sell their investments, and after years in the wilderness, technology has put itself on the UK investing map. Investors should, however, be wary of becoming overexposed.</p>",

But he cautions against expecting a repeat of 1999's dazzling performance, when \u00a3100 invested in January grew to \u00a3282 by December. 'Last year was an aberration. Investors should really be looking for percentage returns in the low- to mid-twenties,' he says. Henderson Global Technology and Aberdeen Technology were both set up in the early Eighties and are the longest-running technology funds. But there has been a spate of launches in recent months from managers such as Jupiter, M&amp;G, Fidelity and Gartmore. For investors, what was once a fairly simple choice has become more complicated. Funds such as Framlington's NetNet and Sarasin's Webs@r offer specific exposure to the Internet, while Close Brothers offers a tracker fund for the UK's new TechMark index. Generally speaking, these funds have fared worse in the recent correction than globally focused technology funds, which usually have a higher exposure in North America. Mark Dampier, head of investment at IFA Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'In the UK and Europe, technology shares are probably more overvalued. There is far less supply, but the same level of demand.' Dampier singles out Aberdeen Technology as a fund which has shown consistent commitment to investment in the sector over many years, and has not allowed a fund manager to dent its performance. But he thinks Jupiter's new fund should not be written off. 'I'd want to wait another month to see how well they're really doing,' he says. Some investors in technology funds rushed to cancel their cheques when the market fell at the beginning of April, but Dampier believes they were shortsighted. He advocates that those considering an investment now should drip their money in, and take advantage of any further price falls to increase their holding. The flood of new technology funds may well slow to a trickle now that the sector has taken a knock. But few advisers will be telling their clients to sell their investments, and after years in the wilderness, technology has put itself on the UK investing map. Investors should, however, be wary of becoming overexposed.",

Arrive unprepared</strong> </p> <p>Before setting foot in the company's offices, be sure you're well-versed in as many of the firm's products or services as possible. Try to make sure you can discuss knowledgeably how your skills and background will mesh with those of the company. And if you have a portfolio or other body of work which might strengthen your case, bring it too. </p> <p>Research - or, rather, the information that research unearths - gives you the edge in an interview.

Wear the wrong clothes</strong> </p> <p>No matter what the corporate culture is - whether khakis and polo shirts or three-piece suits - you should still dress professionally for that first interview. Simple, no-frills business attire for both men and women are still the standard. No heavy fragrances, loud clothes or flashy jewellery. </p> <p>Dress smartly and comfortably. You will be judged in some respects by what you wear. When in doubt, dress conservatively. </p> <p> <strong> 3 . Talk too much</strong> Some graduates are so eager to impress that they scarcely allow questions to be asked. You wouldn't be in the interviewer's office if you hadn't already demonstrated your appeal. Use the actual interview to impress the interviewer with your listening skills, and then thoughtfully lay out why you'll be an asset to the company. </p> <p>Remember to listen - communication is a two-way street. If you are talking too much, you will probably miss cues concerning what the interviewer feels is important. </p> <p>Reflect before answering a difficult question. If you are unsure how to answer a question, you might reply with another question. For example, if the interviewer asks you what salary you expect, try answering by saying \"That is a good question. What are you planning to pay your best candidate?\" </p> <p> <strong> 4 . Undervalue or overvalue yourself</strong> </p> <p>The first won't necessarily cost you the job, but the second definitely could.

If you're right for the job, you'll get a reasonable offer. </p> <p>If you're not in a position to showcase a portfolio of any kind, bring tangible experience to the table. For example, many employers now use behavioural interviewing techniques - they believe that past behaviour is a likely indicator of future behaviour. So if you're asked about a general skill, provide a specific example to help you take advantage of the interviewer's expectations. </p> <p> <strong> 5 . Act desperate for the job</strong> </p> <p>Even if you've been on the job market for some time, the last thing most hiring managers want is someone who looks too eager. If you've been asked in for an interview, then the company believes you have something to offer because of your skills and experience. </p> <p>Don't derail that by acting too eager or nervous, or by asking questions such as, \"When would you want me to start?\" Instead, appear confident, relaxed and in control. </p> <p>Why should you get the job?

      "bodyText": "There are bound to be others who can do as good a job as you did, but they won't even try if you exude distrust or contempt. Your current level of competence doubtless owes much to those who provided encouragement whilst tolerating mistakes. A telling measure of managerial skill is how well you delegate. Mastering the art of redistributing work also provides the passport to an easier life. Although it's hard to stand back and watch someone stumble over seemingly easy tasks, you can't hold on to everything. Once a workload reaches saturation point your performance suffers and you start making mistakes. Being responsible for everything and everyone is not sustainable - let go. Managing people effectively means recognising what each can do and assigning tasks accordingly. The simplest way to encourage confidence and competence in others is to get off their backs. Nurture motivation through training, moral support and financial incentives. Accept others have the ability to achieve results even when their methods are different from yours. Allow for mistakes and false starts - you were a learner once too. Be clear about levels of autonomy and establish boundaries between their and your responsibilities. Do a bit of monitoring and feedback - then sit back and feel your blood pressure drop. Contact Irene Krechowiecka at ijk@excite.com",

Spotted on the internet by famous New York fetish photographer Eric Kroll, Merritt was brought to the attention of Benedikt Taschen, whose publishing house has constantly challenged erotic taboos, with books by Roy Stuart, Elmer Batters, Nobuyoshi Araki, Charles Gatewood and other visual pirates of the world of erotica. </p> <p>Her first book - bold, dark, disturbing and provocative - is unlike any other. Her unposed photographs of herself and sexual partners in repose and at play provide a fascinating insight into the mind of a woman whose life is captured wholesale by the camera.

As soon as I had a camera, I stopped writing and recorded my thoughts and feelings with photographs.\" </p> <p>The portfolio covers six years of Merritt's love life, from orgasm with her first lover at 15 via unbridled S&amp;M images of ropes across bare bodies to more recent encounters of a similarly in-your-face nature that somehow never lose their innocence. Like Cindy Sherman, Merritt is both the subject and the observer of her life, but her gaze is unfailingly sexual and even crude. A slim, dark-haired girl with kiss-me-sadly eyes, she appears to roam the anonymous hotel rooms of American cities on an unending quest for the ultimate in self-revelation, haphazardly framing her body and those of her fleeting lovers at arm's length; seizing the sexual moment in a frenzy of amatory and photographic improvisation. </p> <p>There is beauty here as well as pornography, and a distinct female voice that takes candid self-revelation to new heights of wonderful indecency. The accumulation of isolated body parts, intricately dishevelled limbs, impersonal hotel bathrooms, beds and decor and indiscreet apertures holds a hypnotic fascination for the onlooker, but it is the eyes of Merritt and her partners in voyeurism that will stay with me for a long time - intangible, electronic digital images which lived as a series of 0s and 1s before they were printed out here. It makes me wonder what Sylvia Plath's diaries might have looked like if digital cameras had existed back then. </p> <p>Drastically less erotic are the photos of ordinary Londoners in Greg Friedler's Naked London, which is a companion volume to the photographer's similar books on denizens of New York and Los Angeles. The book is made up of people like you and me in all our fleshly imperfections, posed artlessly against a neutral background, alternately clothed and unclothed. Fascinating for spurious sociological reasons - are all recruitment specialists similarly endowed, and how many female office workers actually shave their pudenda? - this is nonetheless a volume where the flesh is drab. The subjects are courageous in exposing their frailties and secrets, but the banality of the nudity on display here is disheartening and at times quite anti-sexual. </p> <p>Gerard Malanga's Screen Tests, Portraits, Nudes 1964-1996 collects the best photography of the Andy Warhol associate, film-maker and poet. The usual suspects from the New York art scene of the last three decades all feature heavily: youthful, vital images of Sam Shepard, Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, Roman Polanski, Lou Reed and John Cage in their creative prime, captured by Malanga's artful but friendly lens, as well as memorable portraits of Charles Bukowski, Cybill Sheperd and Tennessee Williams which unfailingly capture the artistic spirit of the subjects. </p> <p>But the revelation for me was the section of nudes. This is erotic photography at its very best, with little need for genital close-ups or other cliches. Mostly taken in the 1980s, Malanga's women are usually blonde, frightfully luminous and embody sexual innocence in all its splendour - long-limbed bodies and quiet beauties captured in sunlight, with every mole or minor blemish a sheer adornment. As early as 1974, the great photographer Walker Evans said that \"arguably, Gerard Malanga is one of the best young American photographers\". The all-too short nude section of his book reminds us of the fact. How Nabokov would have loved these women, caught like butterflies in the light of the male gaze.</p>",

Why, detractors protest, must writers shine a light on the shabby corners of their lives simply because they have the professional knowhow to do so? And why do the rest of us trust in their pronouncements on life's grim events sooner than we would trust our own judgment? From the writers' corner comes the well-rehearsed reply that they can do nothing else with their experiences: like the shark, they must keep swimming, or die. </p> <p>What then are we to make of a novel that seeks to imitate this genre, and takes as its subject the very business of literary creation? In Martin Bauman: A Novel, David Leavitt pretends to be a writer writing about writing - although his narrator does little but talk about himself. And that, it would seem, is the point: for his tale of boundless self-regard and uninhibited solipsism amounts to a vicious parody of the vacuousness and arbritrariness of literary reputation - and, by extension, of creativity itself. </p> <p>Which is not to say that it works. It helps if a parody is funny, and Leavitt - or Bauman - rarely is. Instead of humour we get almost 500 pages of minutely drawn, exhaustively and exhaustingly nuanced self-examination. During the course of this mammoth whack of prose we follow Bauman from his days as a writing student, under the tutelage of the scathing icon Stanley Flint, to his emergence as part of a New York literary bratpack. His fame, we under stand, is based on a youthful coming-out story published in \"the magazine\" (the preciousness of which makes it instantly recognisable as The New Yorker), a short-story collection entitled The Deviled-Egg Plate and a novel, The Terrorist. </p> <p>Of these works, we learn little save the barest plot details; of the circumstances surrounding their publication, we learn everything. From the \"thickly slavered, full-gloss\" paint on the walls of \"the magazine\" to the promotional notice for The Terrorist in Publishers' Weekly, from Bauman's first cocktail party to the snapshot of him playing Scrabble with other bratpack writers, the book faithfully chronicles every lurch, stagger and pose of the neophyte scribbler's career. </p> <p>Grafted on to a grim but strangely unconvincing portrait of the Manhattan literary scene in the 1980s is Bauman's true confession: that he is frightfully ambitious, and that his desperation to reach the top started with his discovery that you could cheat your way through school tests. After that, the wholesale plundering of his own life and those of his family and friends seemed a foregone conclusion. </p> <p>As a counterpoint to this guilty secret stands the brazen king-maker Flint, whose assessment of Bauman has always been frank - \"it's easy for me to imagine you turning into a hack, settling for cheap success, and not because you're greedy, but... you desire too desperately to please\" - and who moves mysteriously from editor to writing teacher to publisher to writer, somehow preserving, on seemingly slender grounds, an impregnable reputation. For Bauman he is both mentor and tormentor, an elusive eminence grise paradoxically assuming the role of chief ghost at the feast. </p> <p>\"Flint's first principle\" is \"Get on with it!\", with a rider that warns of the dangers of literary \"throat-clearing\". Leavitt's conceit is that Bauman does anything but get on with it and nothing but clear his throat. Stringing together vignettes that plod through lived experience and skim silently over anything of import, he reveals himself to be an obtuse and clumsy writer: \"Now, as I finished high school, the future that lay before me was one in the potentialities of which I could revel, for it was a blank page, as yet unsullied by the smudges and erasures, the torn edges and ink blotches, of its own experiencing.\"</p> <p>The clue to his nature lies in less overwrought utterances, as when he walks through Manhattan with his new boyfriend: \"Blushing, I kept looking over my shoulder to see if anyone was staring at us. No one was.\" Non-staring, it becomes obvious, is intolerable. </p> <p>Leavitt has had his fair share of literary notoriety (refer to Stephen Spender's estate for details of the furore over his withdrawn novel While England Sleeps), and it's hard not to see much of this roman \u00e0 clef as nifty score-settling. More unsettling than any game of spot-the-celeb is the idea that the author and \"the author\" of this work are one and the same. The parallels between them are plain enough: but one hopes that Leavitt, whose previous work has demonstrated a delicacy of wit and a nicely understated sense of irony, has not accompanied his narcissistic alter ego too far down this particularly pedestrian route.</p>",

This is par for the course for a food writer, and it usually ends up with a hymn of praise to Saint Elizabeth David, whose passion and prose set them on the path of good taste. </p> <p>\"Elizabeth David?\" laughs Slater. \"I'd never heard of Elizabeth David. That was not my family thing at all. We weren't olive-oil-and-garlic people. We were very much meat-and-two-veg-in-the-Midlands people. When I was a child my parents tried spaghetti. Once. They didn't like it.\" </p> <p>Slater explains that the cookery books he devoured (to the exclusion of textbooks, novels or anything else) were really recipe books. \"No introductions or narrative,\" he recalls, \"just a set of instructions and everything decorated with glac\u00e9 cherries or angelica.

      "bodyText": "When Nigel Slater says that his early reading was exclusively devoted to cookery books, the first reaction is to brace oneself. This is par for the course for a food writer, and it usually ends up with a hymn of praise to Saint Elizabeth David, whose passion and prose set them on the path of good taste. \"Elizabeth David?\" laughs Slater. \"I'd never heard of Elizabeth David. That was not my family thing at all. We weren't olive-oil-and-garlic people. We were very much meat-and-two-veg-in-the-Midlands people. When I was a child my parents tried spaghetti. Once. They didn't like it.\" Slater explains that the cookery books he devoured (to the exclusion of textbooks, novels or anything else) were really recipe books. \"No introductions or narrative,\" he recalls, \"just a set of instructions and everything decorated with glac\u00e9 cherries or angelica. Things like the all-colour Hamlyn cookbook or the Penguin books by Margaret Costa. You occasionally still see them in second-hand shops. They were wonderful things.\" Unsurprisingly, Slater says he never thought of doing anything else except cooking.

Elsewhere, there are instructions for Pimp! - The Board Game, a Marilyn Monroe \"celeborg\", a bleeding baby allergic to the letter Q (unfortunately, his name is Quentin), and a caged worm. God knows what really goes on inside Noon's head - and you almost certainly wouldn't want to be there yourself - but in a way we're glad he writes it all down. As it is in Heaven Niall Williams (Picador, \u00a35.99) Buy it at BOL Not one for the cynics among you, Williams's west Ireland tale recounts the sorrows of lonely schoolteacher Stephen and his tailor father Philip, who has never got over the deaths of his wife and daughter. Just as they begin to believe nothing will ever change, Gabriella, a beautiful Italian violinist, arrives on the scene to put things right. The question remains: can Philip fashion a suit so wonderful that it will win his son the musician's heart? Yes, it might sound a little on the corny side, but Williams manages to keep the sentimentalism in check, and he is a subtle and graceful enough writer to make it all work.",

He wrote a book about it in 1872, but the idea fell on deaf ears. Nowadays it is one of the hottest areas of research in evolutionary biology, as two new books make clear. Promiscuity by Tim Birkhead and The Mating Mind by Geoffrey Miller both explore the effects of sexual selection, though in rather different ways. </p> <p>Tim Birkhead, professor of behaviour and ecology at Sheffield University, has spent many years researching the reproductive biology of birds - which is what prompted Darwin to develop the theory of sexual selection in the first place. Darwin was particularly troubled by the peacock, whose exuberant tail appeared to flaunt the logic of natural selection. Not only do big, bright tails seem biologically useless, they can be detrimental to the owner's health, attracting predators and making it harder to escape. It seems that such ornaments should not evolve, and yet nature is full of them, from monkeys with red and white faces to beetles with carapaces of gold and sapphire. </p> <p>Darwin solved this riddle by proposing that animal ornamentation evolved to attract sexual partners. If peahens prefer to mate with those peacocks who have the biggest, brightest tails, then the peacocks with tiny drab ones won't pass on the genes for such tails. From the gene's point of view, if you fail to produce any offspring, it doesn't matter how long you survive; your genes die with you. </p> <p>As the example of the peacock shows, sexual selection is usually about male competition and female choice. If natural selection is a blind watchmaker, sexual selection is a keen-eyed judge at a beauty contest in which the competitors are usually males. Darwinians are often accused of promoting an androcentric view of sexuality, but the theory of sexual selection tells a different story. Rather than viewing females as mere portable wombs, sexual selection theory portrays them as cunning sexual strategists. </p> <p>In Promiscuity, Tim Birkhead argues that male competition and female choice do not stop at the moment of copulation but continues right up to fertilisation, though in the post-coital stage the competitors are no longer males but their sperm.</p> <p>When a female has sex with more than one male during the same fertile period, the sperm from her various partners battle it out inside her reproductive tract for the right to fertilise her eggs. Female choice continues to operate inside the female body, as sperm from one partner may be preferred over the sperm from the others.</p> <p>Birkhead illuminates the murky world of sperm competition with a stunning variety of examples: from the catfish who get pregnant by giving their partners blowjobs to the insects who take cradle-snatching to an extreme by inseminating females before they emerge from their pupal shrouds, the reader is treated to a veritable cook's tour of reproductive biology. </p> <p>If there is one consistent theme to emerge from this bizarre variety, it is that female sexual fidelity is extremely rare in nature. For a long time biologists assumed that promiscuity was a predominantly masculine trait; the research on sperm competition has changed all this. As Birkhead points out, sperm competition would not exist in a species unless the females typically mate with multiple partners during the same fertile period. Biologists have thus been forced to abandon their belief in the myth of the monogamous female. </p> <p>The Mating Mind is also about sexual selection, but differs from Promiscuity in two important ways. First, while Birkhead writes about a whole variety of organisms, Miller focuses exclusively on just one species - a rather curious bipedal ape known as Homo sapiens. Second, whereas Birkhead sets out the consequences of sexual selection for anatomy and behaviour, Miller explores the effects of sexual selection on the mind.</p> <p>Put these two points together and you get a provocative thesis: the most distinctively human aspects of our minds evolved not by natural selection but by sexual selection. The things we think of as most \"human\", such as our capacities for art, morality and language, Miller argues, did not evolve because they provided any survival benefit, but rather because they helped our ancestors to seduce their lovers. Art and creativity are not survival gadgets but courtship devices. </p> <p>Miller is an evolutionary psychologist, but his views on mental evolution are rather different from those of his Darwinian colleagues. Most evolutionary psychologists have adopted a \"survivalist\" view of evolution that neglects the importance of sexual selection. Steven Pinker, for example, thinks that art and creativity are mere by-products of mental capacities that evolved for more practical purposes. In his book How the Mind Works, art, morality and creativity were relegated to a speculative final chapter. To many people, including Miller, this renders evolutionary psychology rather unsatisfying. The human mind may well consist mainly of basic mechanisms for things like vision and locomotion, while morality and art may be mere icing on the cake, yet it is the icing we really care about. </p> <p>In Miller's book, the icing is the point: language, art and morality are presented as adaptations designed for sexual ends. But before you shout \"reductionist\", remember that sexual selection is driven by mate choice: minds take centre stage in evolution. Miller does not want to reduce psychology to biology; on the contrary, he sees psychology as a powerful force in shaping biology. The reason we possess the capacity to tell jokes and compose symphonies is, he claims, because our ancestors preferred funny, creative partners to dull ones. What emerges is a vision of the Stone Age in which love was just as important, and almost as complex, as it is today. Miller argues persuasively that this is \"probably the least reductionistic theory of the mind's evolution one could hope for that is consistent with modern biology\". </p> <p>In suggesting that our artistic capacities function as sexual adverts, Miller is not suggesting that all art is motivated by some unconscious wish to have sex. Just as a peacock does not need to sublimate his libido to grow a pretty tail, so our capacity for art can be a sexual display without any dark Freudian motives to underlie it. All that is needed for Miller's theory to work is that our ancestors preferred to mate with artistic partners.</p> <p>We then need to explain why they had this preference, but Miller has an answer for this too. He argues that works of art have, until very recently, been very reliable indicators of the artist's fitness. To produce a beautiful object such as a statuette or, indeed, a handaxe required dexterity, strength, good eyesight, careful planning and patience. The preference for mating with good artists evolved by piggy-backing on the good genes that children would inherit from artistic parents. </p> <p>Nowadays, of course, things are very different. Machines can turn out thousands of perfect objets d'art much more quickly and efficiently than any human being, so qualities such as symmetry and intricate detail no longer serve as reliable indicators of artistic talent. Thankfully, however, there are still some things that machines cannot do as well as humans, such as write fascinating books like these two. Language still provides humans with a wonderfully reliable way to show off their biological fitness. If we judge these books by the theory Miller propounds, both he and Birkhead should be very pleased with themselves: their peacock's tails should attract a lot of admirers indeed.</p> <p>\u0095 Dylan Evans works at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p>",

Rather than attempt to recover the \u00a34,000 prize money, the Wingate Foundation generously put their hands in their pockets, and the three runners-up, Louise Kehoe, George Steiner and Silvia Rodgers, each received an unexpected \u00a31,333. All of which cast a rather long shadow over the presentation of this year's prizes: to Wladyslaw Szpilman, for his true-life account, The Pianist, and to Howard Jacobson, who picked up the Fiction Prize for The Mighty Walzer. The irrepressibly cheerful Jacobson pocketed a cheque for \u00a34,000, but seemed more attached to the African violet, presumably a stray table decoration, that he was clutching on his way out. \u0095 And so, with unseemly haste, to Amy Jenkins's party for Honeymoon, held at current in-spot (ie, another set of huge rooms with mystifying plumbing arrangements), the Sugar Reef. Unabashed by what we might call \"mixed reviews\", Ms Jenkins appeared resplendent in a white wedding dress, complete with a modesty-preserving veil. The unkind wag who dared to breathe the words \"Miss Havisham\" knows who he is, but the Loafer is feeling kind, so his anonymity is assured - for the moment. \u0095 Faber's challenge to eager number-crunchers to solve the problem at the heart of Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture has been bearing strange fruit. From a budding Ruth Lawrence: \"I am a 12 year-old highly advanced mathematician.\" There have also been certain entries more geared towards the $1 million prize money than a boundless love of number theory. A man encloses a postcard from his wife, living abroad and desperate to clap eyes on him again, as proof of his need for the dosh, while an overseas correspondent issues a rather more concrete claim: \"I would be very grateful if you could advise me when I can travel to London to present my proof of the theory in person. I shall be travelling with my mother.\" Hmm. On present showing, Faber's cash seems safe.",

He has painstakingly prepared a lesson and transcribed it into book form. His subject is very broad: how and why the modern world alters so unpredictably. And he has written about it in the mild, relentless sentences of a classroom evangelist. </p> <p>\"I'm going to take you to Baltimore, to learn from that city,\" he says. \"I'm going to introduce three fascinating kinds of people who play a critical role in our tastes and trends and fashions. I'll take you to a hi-tech company in Delaware... to the subways of New York City...\" The product of all this conscientious continent-crossing will be more than a mere book. It will \"answer questions that lie at the heart of what we would all like to accomplish as educators, parents, marketeers, business people, and policymakers\". </p> <p> The Tipping Point is a very American publication. It is part popular science, part cultural studies, part state-of-the-nation assessment; but most of all it bustlingly reads like a self-help volume. Gladwell, a smart journalist rather than an academic, cites fashion crazes and syphilis outbreaks in the same bright tone. The people he eagerly interviews are entrepreneurs, civic reformers and academics keen to share their discoveries. From them he synthesises a theory about how we live now that is simple, free of politics, and either piercingly clever or quite banal. </p> <p>Gladwell thinks that America, and by implication the rest of the rich world, is ruled by epidemics. Our consumer choices and wider behaviour have become erratic because we are constantly contaminating each other with our preferences. A few people wearing particular shoes in a certain nightclub; the well-publicised actions of a single vigilante; a local shift in public manners in a particular spot: all of these can spread, slowly at first, then suddenly and widely. \"The Tipping Point\" is Gladwell's metaphor, tirelessly pursued through nearly 300 pages, for the moment when a tiny fad goes mass. </p> <p>It is not a completely original notion, as he bravely admits on page 12. During the 1970s, American sociologists studying \"white flight\" from inner-city suburbs noticed that if the black population of an area reached roughly a fifth of the total, then the area would \"tip\": almost all the white people would abruptly move away. Gladwell does not dwell on this rather suspect use of the verb, but expands the metaphor's application and offers many vivid examples of his own. In 1984, for example, the first cheap fax machine went on sale in the US. For the next three years, it sold in the low thousands. Then, in 1987, a million customers bought one - sending faxes had become a business practicality, part of everyday life. </p> <p>Gladwell's explanation is that a minority of us make expert but unintentional advocates for new practices. With an amateur sociologist's flourish, he calls these people \"Mavens, Connectors, and Salesmen\". They are charming; they have connections; they are unafraid to wear strange new trainers. Gladwell is thorough at drawing out what makes such individuals influential, and summarises much interesting research about the power of small physical gestures and word of mouth. </p> <p>Yet a suspicion hovers that too much of the analysis here is faintly second-hand - or merely common sense. The agents of cultural change that Gladwell says he has discovered have been noted under different names before: \"early adopters\" have long featured in articles and books about the popularisation of computers and other gadgetry. Likewise, his examination of fashion subcultures as clues to the currents at play in society is a trick that dates back at least to British writers such as Dick Hebdige during the 1970s. And we all already know that some people have vastly more acquaintances and influence over their friends than others. </p> <p>There is, too, something naive about Gladwell's surprise at present-day fickleness. \"We are all, at heart, gradualists,\" he maintains early on, \"our expectations set by the steady passage of time.\" Later, he insists: \"We all want to believe that the key to making an impact... lies with the inherent quality of the ideas we present.\" But is this faith in a steady, merit-driven world really shared by many people? Has it ever been? </p> <p>The book becomes an extended reminder that Americans are not always as modern-minded as we imagine. Their huge, sprawled-out, suburban country has only fairly recently acquired a national grapevine and the accelerations of national life that go with it. MTV and the internet owe much of their success there to creating \"tipping points\" where few previously existed. Gladwell wisely limits his examples to his own country, but to a European, used to gossip and cities, social claustrophobia and events spinning in quick cycles, he seems a bit slow on the uptake. </p> <p>His conclusion avoids speculations about America's changing media and society for something folksier. \"Look at the world around you,\" he implores. \"With the slightest push - in just the right place - it can be tipped.\" Well-meaning individuals, he argues, should focus their energies in highly specific directions (he cites the removal of graffiti as the catalyst, in recent years, for the New York subway becoming safer). But this feels like too neat an end to the lesson. Having described a world of flux and unpredictability, Gladwell has come up with a rigid set of rules to explain it.

      "body": "<p><strong> The Liberators: Latin America's Struggle for Independence, 1810-1830</strong><br>Robert Harvey <br>John Murray, \u00a325, 561pp</p> <p>Robert Harvey is a clever and genial fellow who was sent to Latin America by the Economist in the 1970s to counter what was perceived as the left-wing propaganda being published in Britain at the time by, among others, this newspaper and the present writer. After he had gorged on a heavy diet of right-wing military dictatorships, his views slowly mellowed and he fell in love with the ambiguities and contradictions of the continent and began to write about it with passion and verve. </p> <p>Apart from a brief and misguided detour into the House of Commons in the Conservative interest, Harvey has led a blameless life as a Daily Telegraph columnist and popular historian, resurrecting significant but forgotten figures such as Robert Clive and restoring them to the Conservative pantheon. Now he has directed his talents towards the extraordinary story of the Latin American liberators, among whom Harvey numbers Bol\u00edvar, Miranda, San Mart\u00edn, O'Higgins, Cochrane, It\u00farbide, and the Brazilian emperor Pedro I. These names would not be on every historian's list, but reflect the enthusiasms of an old-fashioned historian, biased towards colourful and sexually voracious characters whose exploits the reader will enjoy hearing about. </p> <p>British amnesia about Latin America's freedom struggle can best be explained by guilt about missed opportunities. Britain incorporated Haiti into its empire, invaded Nicaragua, sent armies to Argentina, made plans to capture Chile and to seize Mexico; yet after two decades of diplomatic incompetence and military bungling these ambitious plans were set at nought. With an entire continent available at a giveaway price, Britain secured only a tiny Central American foothold from Spain, the miserable territory of British Honduras. The rest of Latin America achieved its independence and freedom largely through its own efforts, and by the vision of its liberators, among whom Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar remains preeminent. </p> <p>A secondary reason for the historical amnesia about the liberators is the large question mark that hovers over their legacy. Bol\u00edvar famously wrote that he had ploughed the sea, and for the great bulk of the people, notably the native Indians and imported black slaves, independence from Spain made life worse. Unbridled white-settler societies invariably cause more damage than benign imperial bureaucracies, and the slaughter of Latin America's Indians in the 19th century was greater than in the previous three centuries of Spanish rule.</p> <p>The fruits of independence were so grim that details of the independence struggle itself have been downplayed in Europe and in North America, and the tales of derring-do that led to a change in the continent's political superstructure in the years between 1810 and 1830 have long mouldered on the library shelves. </p> <p>In Latin America itself, a continent with a ruling elite caught in a cultural timewarp, the story has never died. Newspapers regularly carry comment on the life and works of the independence heroes, filmmakers re-enact the heroics of 19th-century battles and politicians from Castro to Pinochet revive the memory of figures of the past. </p> <p>These stories are now so encrusted in folk myth and allegory that it is often difficult for the outsider to get the true measure of protagonists and events. Harvey writes with feeling of \"the itch to debunk\" in the face of such hero-worship, yet such is his admiration for his cast of characters that he stifles this admirable journalistic trait. Bol\u00edvar, in particular, is restored to his proper place in history, his generalship putting him on a par with Julius Caesar and Augustus, Alexander the Great, Tamerlane and Genghis Khan. </p> <p>Harvey's achievement has been to reassess the story for a new generation of readers outside the continent, recovering some of its excitement and panache. His larger failure is his inability to tackle adequately the Liberators' legacy. Uninterested in the fate of the blacks, Indians or the common people, he falls back on the hope that things may now be improving and the ideals of the Liberators may be worth reviving. </p> <p>Like all good conservative historians, he reconstructs the past with the eye of a romantic novelist.

      "bodyText": "The Liberators: Latin America's Struggle for Independence, 1810-1830 Robert Harvey John Murray, \u00a325, 561pp Robert Harvey is a clever and genial fellow who was sent to Latin America by the Economist in the 1970s to counter what was perceived as the left-wing propaganda being published in Britain at the time by, among others, this newspaper and the present writer. After he had gorged on a heavy diet of right-wing military dictatorships, his views slowly mellowed and he fell in love with the ambiguities and contradictions of the continent and began to write about it with passion and verve. Apart from a brief and misguided detour into the House of Commons in the Conservative interest, Harvey has led a blameless life as a Daily Telegraph columnist and popular historian, resurrecting significant but forgotten figures such as Robert Clive and restoring them to the Conservative pantheon. Now he has directed his talents towards the extraordinary story of the Latin American liberators, among whom Harvey numbers Bol\u00edvar, Miranda, San Mart\u00edn, O'Higgins, Cochrane, It\u00farbide, and the Brazilian emperor Pedro I. These names would not be on every historian's list, but reflect the enthusiasms of an old-fashioned historian, biased towards colourful and sexually voracious characters whose exploits the reader will enjoy hearing about. British amnesia about Latin America's freedom struggle can best be explained by guilt about missed opportunities. Britain incorporated Haiti into its empire, invaded Nicaragua, sent armies to Argentina, made plans to capture Chile and to seize Mexico; yet after two decades of diplomatic incompetence and military bungling these ambitious plans were set at nought. With an entire continent available at a giveaway price, Britain secured only a tiny Central American foothold from Spain, the miserable territory of British Honduras. The rest of Latin America achieved its independence and freedom largely through its own efforts, and by the vision of its liberators, among whom Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar remains preeminent. A secondary reason for the historical amnesia about the liberators is the large question mark that hovers over their legacy. Bol\u00edvar famously wrote that he had ploughed the sea, and for the great bulk of the people, notably the native Indians and imported black slaves, independence from Spain made life worse. Unbridled white-settler societies invariably cause more damage than benign imperial bureaucracies, and the slaughter of Latin America's Indians in the 19th century was greater than in the previous three centuries of Spanish rule. The fruits of independence were so grim that details of the independence struggle itself have been downplayed in Europe and in North America, and the tales of derring-do that led to a change in the continent's political superstructure in the years between 1810 and 1830 have long mouldered on the library shelves. In Latin America itself, a continent with a ruling elite caught in a cultural timewarp, the story has never died. Newspapers regularly carry comment on the life and works of the independence heroes, filmmakers re-enact the heroics of 19th-century battles and politicians from Castro to Pinochet revive the memory of figures of the past. These stories are now so encrusted in folk myth and allegory that it is often difficult for the outsider to get the true measure of protagonists and events. Harvey writes with feeling of \"the itch to debunk\" in the face of such hero-worship, yet such is his admiration for his cast of characters that he stifles this admirable journalistic trait. Bol\u00edvar, in particular, is restored to his proper place in history, his generalship putting him on a par with Julius Caesar and Augustus, Alexander the Great, Tamerlane and Genghis Khan. Harvey's achievement has been to reassess the story for a new generation of readers outside the continent, recovering some of its excitement and panache. His larger failure is his inability to tackle adequately the Liberators' legacy. Uninterested in the fate of the blacks, Indians or the common people, he falls back on the hope that things may now be improving and the ideals of the Liberators may be worth reviving. Like all good conservative historians, he reconstructs the past with the eye of a romantic novelist. Untainted by any knowledge or sympathy for economics or sociology, his book is delightfully archaic, largely about maps and chaps. The pen portraits of his heroes are deftly done: their mistresses are \"pretty\" or \"beautiful\", the villains \"sinister\". However, for the general reader he succeeds well in bringing the Liberators glowingly to life. \u0095 Richard Gott's book, In the Shadow of the Liberator: Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and the Transformation of Venezuela, will be published later in May.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Twist</strong></p> <p>After a few weeks, I ask Jack if he wants to meet Billy. </p> <p>\"I don't know,\" he says. \"Do you want to meet my last girlfriend?\" </p> <p>Since I know they're estranged, I say, \"I would if she was your best friend. I would if she was the most important person in your life.\" </p> <p>On our way to Billy's, Jack says, \"Now would be a good time to tell me that I have nothing to worry about.\" He suggests I assure him that there's no chance I'll ever go back with Billy. \"Or tell me how much you fought.\" </p> <p>\"We didn't fight,\" I say. </p> <p>He says, \"Maybe I haven't made myself clear.\" </p> <p>I kiss him on the mouth. \"Would it help if I told you we never had sex?\" </p> <p>He thinks I'm joking. \"It would be better if you said you never had it in the last year,\" he says. \"Or that it was never really good.\" </p> <p>I repeat: \"We never had sex.\" </p> <p>\"Why?\" </p> <p>\"We weren't that kind of couple,\" I say. </p> <p>\"You mean the couple kind?\" </p> <p>\"We were a couple,\" I say. \"We just didn't have sex.\" </p> <p>The cab pulls up to Billy's building. Usually Jack insists on paying the fare, but he doesn't even seem to notice the cab has stopped. I hand a ten to the driver. \"Keep $7, please,\" I say. </p> <p>On the sidewalk, Jack says,\"I don't understand.\" </p> <p>I hesitate. It doesn't feel like my secret to tell. Even now, Billy doesn't tell people he's gay. He's never even told his parents, though he insists they know; he says, \"In the South, talking about your personal life is considered bad manners.\" The first time he told me that, I said, \"Whereas having sex in truckstops is genteel?\" </p> <p>He said, \"It's private.\" </p> <p>Billy has lit about a hundred tea candles, and his apartment looks almost religious. Though it's summer, I sing, \"Silent night, holy night,\" as we walk in. Jack takes in Billy's living room - the bleached wood floors, the pure white sofa, the fresh white tulips - and turns to meet Billy, himself in a white shirt and white pants. </p> <p>The two shake hands, and Jack says, \"I wasn't prepared for this.\" </p> <p>Suddenly, I'm worried about what Jack will say; I feel protective of Billy the way I did of my grandfather when I was little and heard boys cursing in the street. </p> <p>But Jack says, \"I think I should've showered more thoroughly.\" </p> <p>Billy laughs and says that he only invites people over so he can clean up afterward. </p> <p>\"Really,\" I say to Jack, \"trash the place.\" </p> <p>Billy asks what we want to drink. </p> <p>\"You can have anything you want,\" I tell Jack, \"as long as it's clear.\" </p> <p>Jack says, \"Martini?\" </p> <p> \"Olive or twist?\" Billy asks. </p> <p>I do the twist. </p> <p>\"Oliver Twist,\" Jack says. \"You think that's how Dickens came up with the title?\" </p> <p>\"Probably,\" Billy says. \"He did come up with 'Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face twisted into a look of semi-comical woe.' \" </p> <p>They go from English literature to French, down to South America and north to the New Yorker. They disagree on everything, but happily, and I realise they are getting along man-style. </p> <p>At dinner, they ask first-meeting questions, but it's as though they're just going through formalities they're already way past. Billy says, \"I hear you're a big wheeler-dealer.\" </p> <p>Jack says, \"I'm more of a wheeler-wheeler, since none of the deals are going through.\" </p> <p>I am ecstatic watching my males bond. </p> <p>At dessert, Kind Of Blue comes on, and they talk about how it was recorded in a single session and defined the art of improvisation. Jack tells a story about what a slob Miles Davis was, and makes his voice hoarse imitating him: \"So what? I play the music. Someone else cleans up. That's the deal.\" </p> <p>They laugh and I laugh, too, but I get this pang. I remember the way I used to when Billy had men over; I'd pretend that I belonged, even though I felt like a Naugahyde ottoman among chintz divans, and suddenly I am more than kind of blue. </p> <p>I am thinking it is past time to go when Billy excuses himself to get his saxophone. I am having trouble looking at Jack, so I clear the dishes, and he helps. He notices the picture of me and Billy on the refrigerator. It was taken during art school, and we're dressed sort of alike; at a glance, we could pass for twins. Looking at the picture, Jack says, \"I can't decide whether you're cute or sick.\" </p> <p>I say, \"I can't decide whether you're cute.\" </p> <p>Right away I wish I could take it back and I try to. I say, \"I'm just kidding.\" </p> <p>\"Very funny,\" he says. </p> <p>In the living room, Billy begins to play his saxophone, and I say, \"Go, cat, go,\" even though I'm thinking, And Miles to go before I sleep. </p> <p>Billy plays beautifully; he always does. When he finishes I applaud along with Jack, but I think, I am the sound of one hand clapping. </p> <p>In the cab, I pretend to doze on my boyfriend's shoulder; back at his apartment, I pretend to fall asleep in his bed. </p> <p>I hear him brushing his teeth. He opens the refrigerator, drinks from the bottle of water, turns off the lights, and climbs up to the loft bed with me. He puts his arms through mine, his hands on my breasts. </p> <p>In sleep, he nuzzles into me. That's good, I think. But then: He's asleep; he could be dreaming about anyone. </p> <p>This is the first night we haven't made love; that's bad, I think. But then: I'm the one who faked sleep. </p> <p>I remember the muscle I used in order not to know what I knew about Billy early on, and I ask myself if I am using that muscle now. </p> <p>I remember telling Billy, \"But we're the perfect couple,\" and his response: \"Except we don't couple.\" Now, all these months later, I'm stunned not by his words but mine. They echo here in the quiet of my new boyfriend's apartment. </p> <p>When I wake up, Jack is making coffee. From my perch, I look down at his apartment, at the map of Iowa tacked to his wall, the records in crates, the futon sofa, and I think, No gay man could live in such a profoundly undecorated apartment. But then I think, Oh, good, now I'm relying on stereotypes to figure out my life. </p> <p>Then Jack comes up to the loft and sets my coffee and his on the ledge. He lies beside me in his boxer shorts. </p> <p>I try to act normal. I say, \"Did you like Billy?\" </p> <p>\"I did,\" he says. \"You were the one I had the problem with.\" </p> <p>I feel as naked as I am, and I pull the sheets up to my neck. \"I guess I knew that,\" I say. </p> <p>\"It was fine with Billy,\" he says. \"But it might not have been. He's your ex-boyfriend, even if he is gay. You could've looked out for me a little. I would've done that for you.\" </p> <p>I know he would have, which is just one reason I don't want to lose him. \"I'm sorry,\" I say. </p> <p>\"It's okay,\" he says. He looks at me then, in a way that Billy never has or will. </p> <p>But I've never been more aware of how little I know about loving a man straight on. It feels impossible to figure out and do at the same time; it seems to require eye-hand coordination I don't have. </p> <p>Then he picks up a corner of the sheet and pulls it down. I think only a twisted sister would resist what she herself wants, and I do not resist. I am the chicken who crosses the road and gets to the other side.</p> <p><strong>Mox</strong></p> <p>After dinner, Lisa tells me we need to talk.</p> <p>I'm at the sink. She's at the table.</p> <p>I say, \"Sure,\" as though I have nothing to worry about, as though this talk could just be the talk she was talking about when she said we never talk.</p> <p>I clear the rest of the dishes as slowly as I can without appearing deliberately slow.</p> <p>When I reach for her wine glass, she says, \"I'm still drinking this,\" with the quiet authority I have heard her use with insistent telemarketers and my right-wing colleagues.</p> <p>\"Sorry,\" I say, and then hesitate. In counselling Lisa complained that I seem to speak without feeling; so I ask myself, Am I sorry? I am, though not for taking her wine glass. I let the \"sorry\" stand.</p> <p>I get the wine from the refrigerator and refill my own glass too full, conspicuously full, as though I know that our talk calls for anaesthesia. No - the less prepared for her news I appear, the harder it will be for her to deliver. I pour the equivalent of a gulp back into the bottle; a sip runs down its neck.</p> <p>When I offer the bottle to her, I realise that I should've poured her glass before mine. \"Thanks,\" she says.</p> <p>I say, \"You're welcome,\" a phrase strangers but not couples use; thank you - yes, you're welcome - no. Although I am trying to remain calm, it is clear to me on some level that the situation is panic-worthy - whatever level it is that makes a man say \"you're welcome\" instead of nothing. </p> <p>She says, \"Come sit down.\"</p> <p>I say, \"I just want to finish up,\" as the idea occurs to me, a good idea, a great idea: I will load the dishwasher, which is her job, thereby showing her that I am capable of spontaneous reversals. I will change before her eyes. </p> <p>With gusto, I rinse our water glasses, bowls and plates; with devotion, I rinse the silverware, one utensil at a time. I would happily wash the pots and pans, but this would come across as my usual ostentatious display of generosity. </p> <p>Instead, I reorganise the dishwasher to make it easier for Lisa to empty tomorrow. I am putting forks with forks and knives with knives when she says, \"Max.\" </p> <p>\"Max,\" she says, not \"Babe\" or \"Honey\" or even \"Mox\", the nickname she uses to tease me out of what she has termed my Germanic severity. \"Hey Mox,\" she said only a month ago, while I was grading papers from my graduate seminar, \"why so shtern?\" To explain, I quoted from the most dismal example. Only now do I recognise the narrative shift in her tone - from present to past, second person to third; she was already in the living-room-to-be of her future, saying, \"I used to call him Mox.\"</p> <p>Now I think of saying to her, Why so shtern? A joke would be just what she wouldn't expect from me, a joke is just what I need.</p> <p>Instead, I say, \"One sec,\" or I think I've said it; maybe I just meant to. On my way to the bathroom, I imagine her saying, He'd just walk out of the room while I was talking. So, I call out, \"One sec,\" just in case. </p> <p>In the bathroom, I look in the mirror. I try to see my face not as mine but hers - the face she has been looking at and doesn't want to look at any more. I pull at my jowls. I unfurrow my brow. Relax, I tell myself. Cheer up!</p> <p>When I come out, I am smiling like an idiot. I sit down with her, waiting for her to see the open and cheerful man I have become.</p> <p>She's wearing the sweater with the extra-long sleeves, the one I think looks misshapen. \"That's a pretty sweater,\" I say.</p> <p>She says, \"I thought you didn't like it.\"</p> <p>The old me would say, If you know I don't like it, why do you wear it? The new me says, \"I love it!\" and as I say it, I do. The sleeves are so long that only the tips of her pale, pretty fingers show. She looks like a little urchin, so vulnerable! But clean, too: Her nails are pink and white rimmed, shiny with clear polish.</p> <p>She notices me looking at them, and she pulls the sleeves all the way down. I am the author of this reaction; I am the one who taught her that I notice only what I am about to criticise. She tells me that it's time to quit.</p> <p>She goes on, explaining why, but her voice is just sound to me; I can't make out words. Then I remind myself that I am no longer the man she is describing. I think, I am another man. I am a new man. I am the next man she will love. I change every \"you\" to \"he\". Now I can listen with compassion. I listen with love. With my eyes, I tell her that I understand and agree completely. I want to say, You think he crushed you! Wait till you hear what he did to me! But I remember the counsellor saying, \"Don't interrupt.\"</p> <p>When she stops, I say, \"Go on,\" just as the counsellor did. \"Please.\"</p> <p>The counsellor would observe that I am thinking of what to say next, instead of listening to her. As the counsellor, though, I forgive myself: first, because forgiveness is essential to moving beyond difficulty; and, second, because I'm not thinking of my arguments or of undermining hers. All I want is to make her happy.</p> <p>In my head, I ask for help; I even bring my palms together as though in prayer. The phrase We are all God's children comes to me. Of course! She hasn't mentioned children for years; she must have been hoping I would raise the subject, and now I will. </p> <p>I'll tell her that we can have as many as she wants. I will finally give her the joy she deserves! Joy in abundance! Joy overdue! I will tell her that we can name the first boy after her father! We can name all of them after her father! Leo I! Leo II! Leo III! I am trying not to smile. I am careful not to interrupt.</p> <p>It is Lisa who interrupts herself. She says, \"Are you okay?\"</p> <p>I say, \"I've never been better,\" with all of the feeling I feel right now.</p> <p>\u00a9 Melissa Bank, 2000.

She says, \"Come sit down.\" I say, \"I just want to finish up,\" as the idea occurs to me, a good idea, a great idea: I will load the dishwasher, which is her job, thereby showing her that I am capable of spontaneous reversals. I will change before her eyes. With gusto, I rinse our water glasses, bowls and plates; with devotion, I rinse the silverware, one utensil at a time. I would happily wash the pots and pans, but this would come across as my usual ostentatious display of generosity. Instead, I reorganise the dishwasher to make it easier for Lisa to empty tomorrow. I am putting forks with forks and knives with knives when she says, \"Max.\" \"Max,\" she says, not \"Babe\" or \"Honey\" or even \"Mox\", the nickname she uses to tease me out of what she has termed my Germanic severity. \"Hey Mox,\" she said only a month ago, while I was grading papers from my graduate seminar, \"why so shtern?\" To explain, I quoted from the most dismal example. Only now do I recognise the narrative shift in her tone - from present to past, second person to third; she was already in the living-room-to-be of her future, saying, \"I used to call him Mox.\" Now I think of saying to her, Why so shtern? A joke would be just what she wouldn't expect from me, a joke is just what I need. Instead, I say, \"One sec,\" or I think I've said it; maybe I just meant to. On my way to the bathroom, I imagine her saying, He'd just walk out of the room while I was talking. So, I call out, \"One sec,\" just in case. In the bathroom, I look in the mirror. I try to see my face not as mine but hers - the face she has been looking at and doesn't want to look at any more. I pull at my jowls. I unfurrow my brow. Relax, I tell myself. Cheer up! When I come out, I am smiling like an idiot. I sit down with her, waiting for her to see the open and cheerful man I have become. She's wearing the sweater with the extra-long sleeves, the one I think looks misshapen. \"That's a pretty sweater,\" I say. She says, \"I thought you didn't like it.\" The old me would say, If you know I don't like it, why do you wear it? The new me says, \"I love it!\" and as I say it, I do. The sleeves are so long that only the tips of her pale, pretty fingers show. She looks like a little urchin, so vulnerable! But clean, too: Her nails are pink and white rimmed, shiny with clear polish. She notices me looking at them, and she pulls the sleeves all the way down. I am the author of this reaction; I am the one who taught her that I notice only what I am about to criticise. She tells me that it's time to quit. She goes on, explaining why, but her voice is just sound to me; I can't make out words. Then I remind myself that I am no longer the man she is describing. I think, I am another man. I am a new man. I am the next man she will love. I change every \"you\" to \"he\". Now I can listen with compassion. I listen with love. With my eyes, I tell her that I understand and agree completely. I want to say, You think he crushed you! Wait till you hear what he did to me! But I remember the counsellor saying, \"Don't interrupt.\" When she stops, I say, \"Go on,\" just as the counsellor did. \"Please.\" The counsellor would observe that I am thinking of what to say next, instead of listening to her. As the counsellor, though, I forgive myself: first, because forgiveness is essential to moving beyond difficulty; and, second, because I'm not thinking of my arguments or of undermining hers. All I want is to make her happy. In my head, I ask for help; I even bring my palms together as though in prayer. The phrase We are all God's children comes to me. Of course! She hasn't mentioned children for years; she must have been hoping I would raise the subject, and now I will. I'll tell her that we can have as many as she wants. I will finally give her the joy she deserves! Joy in abundance! Joy overdue! I will tell her that we can name the first boy after her father! We can name all of them after her father! Leo I! Leo II! Leo III! I am trying not to smile. I am careful not to interrupt. It is Lisa who interrupts herself. She says, \"Are you okay?\" I say, \"I've never been better,\" with all of the feeling I feel right now. \u00a9 Melissa Bank, 2000.

      "body": "<p><strong> Shakespeare's Language</strong> <br>Frank Kermode <br>Allen Lane, \u00a320, 320pp <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502121991,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p>A couple of years ago I asked Derek Walcott, one of the finest living poets in the language and certainly the most Shakespearean, if he found it oppressive to live with the daily anxiety of Shakespeare's influence. Not really, he replied. The more he read Shakespeare, the more he learned by heart, the less awestruck he became. He was increasingly aware of the passages of flat, wordy or obscure verse among the greatness. He had achieved a kind of respectful intimacy with Shakespeare. This is the relationship proposed by the poet John Berryman, who once wrote that to be constantly \"incredulous\" before Shakespeare's achievement is a little naive, smacking of what Kierkegaard called \"playing the game of marvelling at world-history\". </p> <p>The same might be said for Frank Kermode. He has no time for some of the current theoretical developments, especially those that claim to find Shakespeare's reputation inflated or imagined, or undeservedly enforced by the school examination apparatus. Yet he is equally uninterested in Shakespeare idolatry, whereby no passages in the plays are permitted to show signs of haste or confusion, and Shakespeare is petrified into the marble of \"genius\". You might say that this is Kermode treading his customary middle way between high theory and unmediated amateurism, but Shakespeare's Language is a magnificent book, the honey of a lifetime's visits to the Shakespearean garden, and makes great virtues of reasonable in-betweenness. </p> <p>For Kermode is bold enough to say that Shakespeare's original audience could not possibly have followed the poetic complexities of his greatest soliloquies and speeches, any more than we are able to follow all of their densities today. Furthermore, there are plenty of passages which are not just difficult but apparently unnecessarily obscure, sometimes muddled as passages of thought or explication. Kermode is especially interested in what he calls the \"new style\" that began to show itself in Richard II and Henry IV parts 1 and 2 and bloomed into the kinetic, knotted, dangerous soliloquies of Macbeth, Hamlet and King Lear. This new style, characterised by an intense brooding on sets of words and images, at times \"takes the poet beyond the limits of reason and intelligibility\". </p> <p>What a pleasure it is to read a critic so learned, so rammed with scholarship, who at the same time endeavours to read Shakespeare as a writer, fallible like any other. Above all, Kermode sees Shakespeare at all times as a dramatic poet, a writer for the stage who lends his verse to his characters. He sees that Shakespeare discovered how he might use analogy and metaphor as the acutest representation possible of a mind engaged in thought. It is no exaggeration to say that, for Shakespeare, the mind is metaphor. </p> <p>But there are many passages in the plays about which even scholars argue. What hope of instant exegesis has the ordinary listener? Kermode selects a speech from Richard II in which Bushy, the King's favourite, is consoling the Queen and developing a complex analogy about shadows, false and true sorrow, eyes, tears and perspective. As Kermode remarks, it is difficult to be entirely clear what Shakespeare or Bushy is saying here. But the important thing is that Bushy is \"thinking\": he \"has hit upon a difficult analogy and is working it out as cleanly as he can\". The speech is \"one of a kind not infrequently to be found in Shakespeare, where a complicated idea fails to find perfect expression\". Such passages were often censured by Dr Johnson, who then attempted to tidy them up. </p> <p>Nowadays, we bathe in ambiguity, award each word seven lives and always give the poet the benefit of the Empsonian doubt. But though he is as equipped as any modern critic at teasing out meanings, Kermode has a Johnsonian robustness, and examines the idea that in such passages Shakespeare is trying, and failing, to work something out. \"The exciting thing about Bushy's speech is that in it we find Shakespeare struggling with a sentiment rendered stubborn by the circumstance that the speaker appears to be thinking, is doing his intellectual best to get his consolation across, and is getting slightly muddled in the process, the slight muddle being a by-product of the effect to represent intellection.\" </p> <p>In other words, Shakespeare's dramatic poetry is an enormous effort to represent the mind. Like Harold Bloom (though Kermode's book is much better than Bloom's recent book on Shakespeare), Kermode sees the beginning of western individuation in Shakespeare, and Hamlet as the great shift in literary characterisation. Kermode is also aware - though he might have pressed this point even further - that a curious paradox hangs from the idea of a dramatic poet using metaphor and analogy to represent the turbulence of his characters' minds. For this means that Shakespeare, as it were, donates his own cherished metaphors to his characters.</p> <p>In the speech by Bushy, for instance, is Shakespeare trying to say something about shadows and tears and himself getting \"muddled\"? Or is he perfectly capable of greater clarity, but deliberately muddling things a little in order to give us the most direct sense possible of a mind struggling to express itself? </p> <p>This is an inevitable tension in dramatic poetry. For instance, when Cornwall shouts out that his servants should bind fast Gloucester's \"corky arms\", listeners get a characteristically Shakespearean thrill of pleasure at the delicious justice of the word - the old man's arms, white and crumbly, like cork. But it is hardly likely that a vicious aristocrat would have expressed himself as beautifully as this, and most listeners decide for them selves that this is Shakespeare the poet having his say - inserting into a character's mouth a line of unlikely but lovely poetry. </p> <p>It is, then, always a matter of balance. Shakespeare is supremely at the service of his characters, yet always, necessarily, asserting himself as a poet. It seems likely not that he deliberately muddled things in order to let his characters seem muddled, but that metaphor and analogy have an inevitable, inherent chanciness of which he was fully aware. Metaphor is notoriously open to \"failure\"; part of what makes Shakespeare so daring is that he is constantly running this risk. (Melville is his modern heir.) </p> <p>Kermode takes us through the major tragedies and the last plays, paying very acute attention to questions like these. He is a marvellous reader of the way Shakespeare gives different idiolects to different characters and dares to introduce low comedy into tragic situations, even at the risk of disrupting the \"high\" effect.</p> <p>It was this mixing of high and low which so troubled the young Schiller, as he tells us in his essay \"Naive and Sentimental Poetry\". One of Kermode's examples is the Nurse's foolish, repetitive, pretentious lamentations over Juliet's apparent corpse in Act 4 of Romeo and Juliet. An extraordinary moment to risk laughter, says Kermode. Yet the Nurse is just the kind of person who would be \"sly enough to imitate the mourning of her betters\". In other words, she is comically inauthentic, even in grief, and Shakespeare wants to shows us this. From this kind of contradictory reality is built modern fictional character, and Shakespeare is both its founder and still its greatest practitioner. </p> <p>Kermode is a great critic of the way Shakespeare bends his poetry in the service of different characters. Discussing The Tempest, he remarks that Shakespeare had to create a special language for Ariel, who is not human. Early in the play Ariel tells how he has left the newly shipwrecked Ferdinand sitting by himself \"in an odd angle of the isle\", \"cooling of the air with sighs\" with \"his arms in this sad knot\".</p> <p>Kermode comments that this curious picture is just how a non-human might represent a grieving earthling: \"The small, sympathetic caricature is a sketch of a mourning human made by one who is familiar with the notion that humans feel sorrows and express it in their own ways.\" That is so finely observed that one will never again encounter that description of Ferdinand without thinking of Kermode's commentary. There are moments like that throughout Coleridge's criticism; Kermode proves himself Coleridge's worthy heir in this superb book.</p>",

Their last decline began in 1993 when Peter Reid, City's most successful manager since Joe Mercer, was summarily dismissed before the season was a month old. Until the arrival of Royle, a dab hand at salvage operations, just over two years ago Manchester City were a rusting hulk, holed below the water-line and crewed with the expertise of the good ship Venus. Now the hoists, cables and pulleys have all but done their job. The right result at Ewood tomorrow and City will sail back into the Premier League next season amid much splicing of mainbraces. Already, however, doubts have been raised about the ability of Royle's team to survive in Premier League waters which are rougher than those in which they sank four seasons ago. Without a substantial and costly refit, it is argued, this City side will be ripe for relegation. Such comments may be ill-timed and nobody is likely to put the point to Royle should Manchester City get the result they need tomorrow. All that concerns Maine Road for the moment is reaching the Premier League. Then and only then will City and their supporters start to wonder about what happens next. Yet there is little doubt that, should the close season find City fans anxiously awaiting the new fixture lists, while smacking their lips at the prospect of renewing local hostilities with United, Royle will need to attend many a summer boot sale in order to bring his squad even remotely in line with what is required to survive. Maine Road may have only a fraction of Old Trafford's spending power but the size of the support which has sustained the team since it dropped to the Second Division, plus the increase in television and sponsorship revenue, should ensure that the side is strengthened in important areas, notably defence. It would remain to be seen whether the extraordinary scoring technique of Shaun Goater, the First Division's leading scorer with 28 goals, could prompt any emotion in Premiership defenders other than helpless laughter. Good man Goater, but another Kevin Phillips he is not.",

      "body": "<p>We are on the train to Manchester doing the City conversation. We have been doing the City conversation for years now. Decades actually. Occasionally it results in bitter arguments. </p> <p>Who's the worst striker you've seen at Maine Road: Tony Cunningham, Trevor Christie or Lee Bradbury? The worst buy: Steve Daley, Steppy Stepanovic or Lee Bradbury? The most heartbreaking moment: Luton's David Pleat dancing across the pitch after he sent us down in 1983? Relegation in 1996 when Liverpool were desperate to let us win but we couldn't oblige? Further relegation in 1998, despite winnning 5-2 at Stoke on the final day? Losing at Wycombe and the train breaking down at Wembley Stadium on the way home? Signing Lee Bradbury? </p> <p>Manchester City have a massive following, arguably the best. Even Sir Alex Ferguson has called us the most steadfast. In the Second Division we averaged 28,000. This season in the First we are averaging 32,000. Next season in the Premiership we will average 67,000. Well, we would if we could. </p> <p>Despite being one of the biggest clubs in the land we last won a trophy in 1976. I went to that League Cup final with my dad who missed both goals because he was lighting up. Our greatest triumph came in 1968 when we won the league championship. A few days later Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup. </p> <p>City fans are the butt of endless bad jokes. The nub of them is that we are masochists, that we enjoy failure. A couple of years ago Colin Schindler wrote an opportunistic book called Manchester United Ruined My Life. It purported to tell the story of the downs and downs of a City fan. Every City fan I know hates the book. Not only is it horribly written, it is also a kick in the soul for any true Blue. As Rob Gretton, the former manager of New Order, said shortly before he died: \"Manchester United didn't ruin my life. Manchester City ruined my life.\" </p> <p>Presumably Schindler thought it would sell more copies with United in the title. He portrayed us as loveable, stoical fans, wryly smiling at our misfortune. What bollocks. We hate failure. </p> <p>We have always wanted to be the best, the best at anything. A couple of years ago we were voted the top team for celebrity fans (Oasis, Bernard Manning, Little and Large - well, they're famous). We've produced the best inflatables in football history (for a season no self-respecting City fan went anywhere without being attached to a five-foot banana). We've even had the best cross-dressing fans (Boxing Day, away at Stoke, Trevor Francis's debut, two goals, 3-1 win and thousands of Manc bruisers dolled out in the daintiest frocks). </p> <p>Blue army! </p> <p>My mate Johnny Bryce is feeling down. He's the one who made me buy a ticket weeks early for the Birmingham match because they'd all be sold out. Now he can't go and he's feeling sick to the knees. I try to cheer him up by reminiscing about City's greatest day. Not beating United 4-0 or 5-1, not winning the championship or European Cup Winners' Cup, but last season's promotion from the Second Division. </p> <p>We were 2-0 down with no time to play against Gillingham. When Kevin Horlock scored we didn't even bother celebrating. 2-1. The little boy next to me was red and swollen, soaked in tears. He was so broken I don't think he noticed the equaliser five minutes into injury-time. We finally won on penalties. </p> <p>There was all kinds of vicious talk. The referee was a Blue; he was said to have celebrated with City fans that night. But we didn't care. It was the greatest day because we fluked it. Every time we have failed we have fluked failure against all odds. Gone down in the last minute on goal difference. And here we were fluking success, just like United have done all these years. </p> <p>It has continued this season. We've fluked our way into the top two of the First Division. We know the team's no good but, for the first time in years, at least they care. And winning games in the last minute after being outplayed is as good as it gets... </p> <p>We head off to Rusholme's curry mile before kick-off. Past Nayub, Imran's, Mehraj, Shandaar, Jutta, Mahal, Tabuk. Fifty curry houses filled with blue shirts. Girls are walking through the streets lipsticked blue and white. All we need to do is beat Birmingham and for Ipswich not to win at Charlton. And there's no way Ipswich can win away to the champions. </p> <p>We're ggoing u-uu-up. </p> <p>Going up, ggoing up, going up. </p> <p>Mike's got the shakes. He is too nervous to eat his curry. </p> <p>A bad team doesn't tell the story. Bad teams need bad managers. And bad managers need bad chairmen. We've had the lot. Sixteen or so managers in 25 seasons. Only two chairmen to talk of - Muppet businessman Peter Swales and toilet-roll king Francis Lee. But they did enough damage for 20. </p> <p>Franny, as we used to call him, came here as a hero, the supreme diver who took us to the championship all those years ago. We were bound to love him. But the day he took over, 30,000 blues were forced to sing 'Happy Birthday, Dear Francis' as he walked on to the pitch through two lines of City ancients. He didn't even put any money into the club. Not the type we needed anyway. </p> <p>We're City till we die, </p> <p>We're City till we die. </p> <p>We know we are, </p> <p>We're sure we are, </p> <p>We're City till we die. </p> <p>And we almost did. In addition to his Maoist tendencies, Lee also appointed his mate as manager. Which is fine if your mate happens to be Bill Shankly or, let's be frank, Ferguson. But Lee's mate was Alan Ball. Now everyone knew that Ball was the worst football league manager since his father a generation previously. He had relegated just about every club he managed. And he did the business for us. </p> <p>Can a football club have a breakdown? I think ours started in 1996. Every home game we seemed to have a new manager... Alan Ball, Phil Neal, Steve Coppell, Frank Clark, even Asa Hartford. Coppell, a former United hero, left after six weeks, his nerves mangled. </p> <p>When Joe Royle finally arrived we had more than 50 players in the first-team squad, the biggest in the country. Every time a new manager arrived he bought a new batch of third-raters, but found that he couldn't sell the old batch of third-raters. Only quality left the club. (Oh Kinky, we miss you!) </p> <p>Joe said he couldn't tell the difference between the first team and the third team... </p> <p>I think I had my personal breakdown about a third of the way through our season in the Second Division, when we were halfway down the table. If we're going to be so bad, I thought, why not be the worst? Why not go down all whole way, Third Division, the Conference? </p> <p>Which is why the Wembley play-off was our greatest day. United had just completed the treble and we didn't care. As we were dancing away from the Twin Towers we came across big Alex Williams, who used to be our keeper till his back gave up and robbed him of greatness. Alex is one of the politest, gentlest men you could meet. </p> <p>\"All right, Alex!\" </p> <p>\"All right, lads! I'll tell you what.\" And he burst into song. </p> <p>\"You can stick your fucking treble up your arse, you can stick your fucking treble up your arse... but that's off the record.\" </p> <p>He was right - they could stick it up their arse. City had just come back from the brink, which meant more than any number of cups. </p> <p>We sing some horrible songs at Maine Road; we say terrible things. We call United fans red scum, which is fair enough. We also call them Munichs - as in the aircrash - which is not. But there is a broader meaning to the phrase. After the air disaster Manchester United became the world's favourite football team. Everyone wept and cheered when they got to the cup final the very season they lost most of their team, even City fans. But at the same time as expanding their support, they loosened their ties with Manchester. Today you're as likely to find United fans from Belfast and Japan and China. </p> <p>Looking round Maine Road, I am amazed at how many kids there are. It was easy for me to be a City fan when I was growing up. We had just won a handful of trophies, we were almost as good as United, on the verge of greatness. Today's kids are the real heroes. And now we're on the verge of greatness. </p> <p>Actually we were on the verge of greatness against Portsmouth last Easter Monday, but we blew a 2-0 lead. Lee Bradbury, \u00a33.5m super-flop, scored both Portsmouth goals. </p> <p>Oh Bradbury, we hate you! </p> <p>City fans are famously lewd and loud. Not during the Birmingham game, though. Joe Royle has told us not to count our points before they're hatched. He reminds us that as a club we've been damned by hubris for three decades. We love Joe. He's plain speaking, abrasive, none of the flash stuff like in the Allison-Bond days. No cigars, just the occasional post-match can of cider. True, he's a dictator who tends to drop players if they show any magic in their feet or a will of their own, but he's a real manager. </p> <p>The game is tight, niggly, unpleasant. The fans are flushed with tension. We score a messy goal. Big fat Bobby Taylor, signed earlier this season, shuffles the ball into the net from three yards out. Funny how often heroic goals are scored by unheroic players. It's how the mediocre secure their place in history. </p> <p>We cling on to victory. I'm 37, too old to be jumping fences and stampeding the pitch. I pick up a couple of square inches of turf to take home for Johnny Bryce. There's never been a celebration like this. The whole pitch covered in blue and white - the fans. The same songs are played as last year: Moving On Up (Mike's crying - he wrote it) followed by Status Quo's Rocking All Over The World. The Quo at their worst and we're doing our hips for all they're worth. Wonderful. </p> <p>From Maine Road through Rusholme all the way to town, cars are tooting, scarves waving , heads popping out of windows. A fire engine passes parping \"Du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du City!\" And I'm surrounded by a surreal song from a distant nightmare. </p> <p>We are not, we're not really here, </p> <p>We are not, we're not really here, </p> <p>Just like the fans of the invisible man, We're not really here! </p> <p>Brycey and Mike hate that song. They think it's defeatist, an unwanted reminder of the days when things were so bad we refused to believe what we were seeing. Now we can sing the song in triumph. The air is warm, the sky light despite the time of night. A man is selling roses, yellow, red and pink, outside one of the curry houses. \"Got any blue ones, mate?\" asks a passer-by. </p> <p>Next day I toddle off to the park with football, kids and radio. I'm happied out from last night and just here to complete the formalities. Charlton are champions and they'll want to thrash Ipswich to give their fans the top send-off. 1-0 to Ipswich. 2-0 to Ipswich. 3-0 to Ipswich. </p> <p>I feel such an idiot for last night. Joe did warn us about being premature, and we ignored him. When we went down from the Premiership in 1996, Steve Lomas was playing out time near the corner flag at 2-2 with Liverpool because he thought we were safe. This could be even more humiliating. </p> <p>Tomorrow we need a draw to secure automatic promotion. Otherwise it may be back to the play-offs. Brycey reminds me that last season at Wembley he said we'd be back, same time, same place next year. </p> <p>Perhaps it's inevitable our return to the top is as painful as possible. But return we will.

      "bodyText": "We are on the train to Manchester doing the City conversation. We have been doing the City conversation for years now. Decades actually. Occasionally it results in bitter arguments. Who's the worst striker you've seen at Maine Road: Tony Cunningham, Trevor Christie or Lee Bradbury? The worst buy: Steve Daley, Steppy Stepanovic or Lee Bradbury? The most heartbreaking moment: Luton's David Pleat dancing across the pitch after he sent us down in 1983? Relegation in 1996 when Liverpool were desperate to let us win but we couldn't oblige? Further relegation in 1998, despite winnning 5-2 at Stoke on the final day? Losing at Wycombe and the train breaking down at Wembley Stadium on the way home? Signing Lee Bradbury? Manchester City have a massive following, arguably the best. Even Sir Alex Ferguson has called us the most steadfast. In the Second Division we averaged 28,000. This season in the First we are averaging 32,000. Next season in the Premiership we will average 67,000. Well, we would if we could. Despite being one of the biggest clubs in the land we last won a trophy in 1976. I went to that League Cup final with my dad who missed both goals because he was lighting up. Our greatest triumph came in 1968 when we won the league championship. A few days later Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup. City fans are the butt of endless bad jokes. The nub of them is that we are masochists, that we enjoy failure. A couple of years ago Colin Schindler wrote an opportunistic book called Manchester United Ruined My Life. It purported to tell the story of the downs and downs of a City fan. Every City fan I know hates the book. Not only is it horribly written, it is also a kick in the soul for any true Blue. As Rob Gretton, the former manager of New Order, said shortly before he died: \"Manchester United didn't ruin my life. Manchester City ruined my life.\" Presumably Schindler thought it would sell more copies with United in the title. He portrayed us as loveable, stoical fans, wryly smiling at our misfortune. What bollocks. We hate failure. We have always wanted to be the best, the best at anything. A couple of years ago we were voted the top team for celebrity fans (Oasis, Bernard Manning, Little and Large - well, they're famous). We've produced the best inflatables in football history (for a season no self-respecting City fan went anywhere without being attached to a five-foot banana). We've even had the best cross-dressing fans (Boxing Day, away at Stoke, Trevor Francis's debut, two goals, 3-1 win and thousands of Manc bruisers dolled out in the daintiest frocks). Blue army! My mate Johnny Bryce is feeling down. He's the one who made me buy a ticket weeks early for the Birmingham match because they'd all be sold out. Now he can't go and he's feeling sick to the knees. I try to cheer him up by reminiscing about City's greatest day. Not beating United 4-0 or 5-1, not winning the championship or European Cup Winners' Cup, but last season's promotion from the Second Division. We were 2-0 down with no time to play against Gillingham. When Kevin Horlock scored we didn't even bother celebrating. 2-1. The little boy next to me was red and swollen, soaked in tears. He was so broken I don't think he noticed the equaliser five minutes into injury-time. We finally won on penalties. There was all kinds of vicious talk. The referee was a Blue; he was said to have celebrated with City fans that night. But we didn't care. It was the greatest day because we fluked it. Every time we have failed we have fluked failure against all odds. Gone down in the last minute on goal difference. And here we were fluking success, just like United have done all these years. It has continued this season. We've fluked our way into the top two of the First Division. We know the team's no good but, for the first time in years, at least they care. And winning games in the last minute after being outplayed is as good as it gets... We head off to Rusholme's curry mile before kick-off. Past Nayub, Imran's, Mehraj, Shandaar, Jutta, Mahal, Tabuk. Fifty curry houses filled with blue shirts. Girls are walking through the streets lipsticked blue and white. All we need to do is beat Birmingham and for Ipswich not to win at Charlton. And there's no way Ipswich can win away to the champions. We're ggoing u-uu-up. Going up, ggoing up, going up. Mike's got the shakes. He is too nervous to eat his curry. A bad team doesn't tell the story. Bad teams need bad managers. And bad managers need bad chairmen. We've had the lot. Sixteen or so managers in 25 seasons.

It comes as no surprise to discover that this was sacred territory for the Arawaks - it's a truly awesome sight. </p> <p> <strong> The resort</strong> </p> <p> The two mountains, Gros Piton and Petit Piton, frame a peaceful bay in the south-westerly part of St Lucia, one of the Windward Islands of the Eastern Caribbean, and Ladera Resort - perched 300m high on the verdant hillside of rainforest that overlooks the bay - has made the most of these dramatic landmarks. The resort doesn't go in for air-conditioning. Its 24 rooms are all completely open to the elements and steep hillside on one side (so, not ideal for kids), more like tree houses than hotel rooms - and mozzies are kept at bay with a net. </p> <p>Built in the 60s as a series of villas by pioneer American architect John de Pol, the resort retains its swinging 60s air - the curvy plunge pools on the terraces and exposed brick give the place a Bond-style glamour - and the breathtaking view it affords has earnt Ladera several film appearances (notably as a location in Superman 2). </p> <p>It is not the most predictable of Caribbean-holiday scenes. A more usual image is of a stretch of white sandy beach and a large hotel - often of the all-inclusive variety. And certainly, in the more commercial, northern region of St Lucia, that is what you will find. St Lucian poet Derek Walcott has described the proliferation on this tiny island of large, beachfront hotels as \"a succession of mini-Miamis\", and he has expressed anger that local people do not feel welcome on their own beaches. </p> <p>But here in the south-west, in the area surrounding the harbour town of Soufri\u00e8re, \"boutique\", hillside hotels are a growing, and welcome, phenomenon (Stonefield Estate and Anse Chastenet are two other notable examples). </p> <p>Ladera respects island culture - it is crammed with locally-made art, furniture and design, and uses all local materials - and it doesn't monopolise the island's shoreline, though guests who wish to visit the beach can catch the hotel's daily bus-ride down the hillside. </p> <p>Three days into our stay, my companion and I still hadn't made it to the beach. This is the perfect spot to zone out. The odd refreshing plunge in our tiny pool and intermittent scoops of mango ice cream were enough to keep us occupied. </p> <p> <strong> Within walking distance</strong> </p> <p> On the afternoon of our third day, we ambled a mile or so down the road, lushly lined with avocado, breadfruit, citrus and almond trees, to visit Mount Soufri\u00e8re's hotly bubbling (and odoriferous) sulphur springs and \"drive-in\" volcano, dormant since 1766. It's a spectacular sight, though it's easy to understand why this moonscape was known, doomily, to the Caribs as Qualibou, or Place of Death. </p> <p>The nearby mineral bathing pool is said by locals to take 10 years off you. The water is hot, bubbly - and pitch black. We wallowed in it for a while, taking it in turns to enjoy the power-shower-like waterfall, and emerged 20 minutes later feeling, if not younger, then at least blissfully relaxed. </p> <p> <strong> The excursions</strong> </p> <p> Ten minutes away in a cab is the town of Soufri\u00e8re, over which the giant Pitons loom. It was the capital under French rule - the island has a complicated history that encompasses waves of native conquests and extinctions, the arrival of the Spanish and slavery, long struggles between the French and the British for dominance, and then, finally, independence 21 years ago. </p> <p>Soufri\u00e8re's pastel, wooden houses, shops and rum bars, with their traditional Caribbean gingerbread fretwork, make for a picturesque scene, and the imposing Catholic church in the centre of town is particularly impressive. By the harbour, the seaside shacks are weatherbeaten, and bat tered boats bob in the water. We allow ourselves to be fleeced a little by hawkers selling engraved coconut shells fashioned into pots. To spend nothing would seem churlish. </p> <p> <strong> The nightlife</strong> </p> <p> A couple of days later, we venture down the hillside to the restaurant and bar owned by Colin Tennant, the English Lord Glenconner who once owned nearby Mustique. Named Bang Between The Pitons - and known in the area simply as Bang - the restaurant is just that, situated in the \"cleavage\", as one local described it to us, of the towering peaks. Tennant (he doesn't use the title here) has become something of an institution on the island, and, surprisingly perhaps, locals speak of the eccentric Englishman with a kind of affectionate indulgence. He used to own the entire coastal valley, much of which is now taken over by a Hilton hotel, complete with imported white sand for the beach. </p> <p>Our evening at Bang, fuelled by red snapper and rum punch, was a fitting finale to a wonderful holiday. Locally renowned twin acrobats from the capital Castris are enlisted by Tennant to perform every Wednesday, and a DJ plays a blend of reggae and calypso to the assembled throng of tourists and locals. </p> <p>The food may not be quite up to the impeccable cuisine at Ladera, but for sheer, unadulterated exuberance, the evening was hard to beat.</p> <p><strong>Places to eat, things to see</strong></p> <p><strong> Restaurants </strong></p> <p> 1 <strong> Dasheene, Ladera</strong><br> Renowned chef Orlando Satchel created the menu, in his absence talented local Nigel Mitchell runs the show.

      "bodyText": "It is a peculiar experience, to lie in bed surrounded by the still, tropical air and pitch darkness, listening to rainforest sounds that are so clear they could almost be coming from a new-age tree-hugger CD - the insistent whirr of a cicada, the croak of a tree frog, not to mention the less soothing squeak of a bat, and one or two indeterminate rustlings that you don't even want to think about. But when you wake, breathe in the fragrant morning air, and take in the view from your outdoor bed - the pink dawn spreading out behind the towering, twin volcanic peaks of the Piton mountains that rise for half a mile out of the Caribbean Sea - it's worth every minute of the occasionally spooky night-time chorus.

It makes a fine comic set-piece, the family holiday descending into misery because there's just no pleasing the kids. But one company at least has decided to take the situation seriously. Cosmos, one of the UK's longest established package tour companies and the largest indepen dent operator, has decided to listen directly to teenagers, promising to adopt their recommendations into the company's family holidays. </p> <p>It's not an easy task. Teenagers are some of the most sophisticated consumers around: media-savvy, fantastically diverse in their interests, aspiring to adulthood but still in need of security. </p> <p>Little wonder that Danny Talbot, product director at Cosmos, admits that tackling the teenage market had proved daunting to the company: \"We have got it more right for younger kids, but this is the hardest one.\" </p> <p>Six \"teenage directors\" aged between 12 and 17 were invited to feed their comments to the firm's \"real\" directors in exchange for a free family holiday this summer - and none of them needed much prompt ing on what they would and wouldn't enjoy. </p> <p>Top of the list for both younger and older kids were water-based activities: a fun pool, water polo, water chutes and banana boats. \"Lots of people don't like to leave their hotel,\" said Laila Rayegan-Tafreshi, 15, from Manchester. \"If there's stuff going on there, why would you want to go anywhere else?\" </p> <p>But the young people also knew what they didn't like, and that was the way operators try to \"entertain\" them into groups. Inzone is Cosmos's club for the over 12s: its \"trendy\" T-shirt (which all the children had been told to wear) and baseball cap (where each had drawn the line) received the definite thumbs down. \"Groups are like controlled fun-time,\" said Laila scornfully. \"Groups wearing T-shirts and hats - it can repel people. I like to be individual on holiday.\" </p> <p>So, too, the marshalled activities where children were simply put with lots of others their own age and expected to bond immediately. \"It's awkward to meet new people,\" said 13-year-old Laura Gregory from Wisbech. \"If you are having fun, you will make friends. But if you're all in a circle saying your name, it doesn't really work.\" </p> <p>Yet all agreed that some social engineering was necessary to get them together with other young people. So how to keep them happy? Younger adolescents, aged between 12 and 14, want activities: beach discos, barbecues, beach volleyball and the frequently-mentioned watersports. The girls suggested make-overs and talent shows, while the boys were keen on computer games and arcades, team sports and videos. </p> <p>With older teenagers, it becomes more difficult. The word \"freedom\" was written in capital letters and underlined by the group of 15- to 17-year-olds. They would like to see more activities organised especially for them - \"where you wear your own clothes\", stressed Laila. </p> <p>Teenagers could sign up for shopping trips to local towns, non-alcoholic discos (\"in real nightclubs\") and local water parks. They wanted their own keys to their bedrooms when they were sharing with parents, and a discount to allow them to bring a friend more cheaply on the trip. Once again watersports scored highly, though with more adventurous spin - water skiing, bungee jumping, jet skiing. Karaoke and Blind Date competitions would provide marshalled opportunities for flirtation. </p> <p>Mostly, they wanted the opportunity to take part in organised activities if they chose to, and the freedom to look after themselves if they preferred. \"When you are on holiday as a teenager, you want to be treated like an adult,\" said Christian Stokes, 17, from Romsey in Hampshire, . </p> <p>\"We have patronised them by giving them a T-shirt,\" admitted Talbot with a smile. \"But I honestly don't think any other tour operator is getting it right either. At least we can be big enough to say, well, we cocked up.\" </p> <p>It's a fiendishly difficult audience to cater for, however, and perhaps just as parents are doomed to misunderstand their teenagers, holiday companies may never get it quite right either. All of the older children could have passed for over 18 - and one wonders whether all the watersports in the world will be able to compete with the allure of nightclubs serving sangria and playing Balearic house till 6am. </p> <p>\"If I hadn't won a free holiday, I would be going away with 12 mates to a villa,\" admitted Christian, away from the besuited directors.

Maybe we were apprehensive: everyone knew the agonies of Scott and Shackleton, and we were warned that our brains would freeze in 90 seconds if we fell overboard. Fur seals, too, would bite, and they move faster than a human clad in rubber boots. The map featured places with names like Exasperation Inlet, Cape Disappointment and Danger Island. </p> <p>There were other reasons for unease. We were excited about visiting a land mass bigger than the US without streets, towns, cows or soldiers, but we knew we were part of a process that had smudged that innocence. In their defence, the tour operators - who will ferry 14,000 people to Antarctica next year - argue that awareness enhances protection, and they have helped draft laws against penguin rustling. </p> <p>The first landfall was King George Island, an 100-mile dribble of rock and ice at the upper end of the South Shetlands archipelago where Polish scientists shivered in yellow huts on the southern shore of Admiralty Bay. It was after 10pm and bright daylight when we tumbled on to the inflatables and then crunched along a gravel beach to inspect the penguins. Bleached whale vertebrae were strewn along the foreshore like the fuselage of a shattered airliner. </p> <p>Next morning, the ship slid past shards of ice hundreds of yards long. Smaller fragments, which sagged into the water, were occupied by groups of penguins who stood impassive as skittles as our 2,800 tonnes shot past. Eighty-five years earlier, Shackleton with 27 men and several dogs pitched camp for three months on an ice raft just like these. </p> <p>We were in a dream, gliding in a turquoise glow. Once or twice a day, we were counted down the aluminium ladder, swung into the twitching rubber boats and taken to desolate beaches where penguins leered at us like inverted exclamation marks. These were all strange and haunting places. Perhaps the strangest was Deception Island, a fractured volcano crater where the huts and rusting blubber tanks and the graveyard of an old Norwegian whaling station were swamped by lava. </p> <p>Past eruptions had blistered the hulls on anchored boats, and the water was so warm at the still-steaming shore that some passengers managed a quick swim. A silver aeroplane without wings or motor lay spreadeagled outside a corroding hangar. The air reeked of sulphur. </p> <p>On Paulet Island, there were 100,000 penguins, letting out the kind of juddering screech a wardrobe makes when dragged across a varnished floor. Grey-furred penguin chicks squawked on the ledges of a tiny roofless ruin in which a century ago three shipwrecked Swedish scientists had sheltered for nine months. </p> <p>Dogged creatures, penguins: in the ceramic cleft of Orne Harbour, on the continent itself, we ploughed up an almost sheer snow face to a plateau 500ft above the glistening Gerlache Strait and there, on the crags, were a dozen nesting pairs dug in like eagles. Below us, amazingly, a three-masted schooner slipped south, a phantom from the days of Scott. </p> <p> At Hannah Point on Livingston Island, Simone, a researcher from Jena University, explained that she was using electronic eggs to monitor the penguins' heartbeat when tourists passed.

Through the raging snow, we counted 15 dark brown huts and nine white crosses on the slope above them. </p> <p>Britain's Port Lockroy base was built in 1944 to monitor German naval movements in the area, and it remained occupied until 1962 to help with research into the ionosphere. We had expected a large fortress-laboratory, but instead found only an 80ft-long creosoted garden shed. </p> <p>Inside, it was like an ancient Hebridean shop, where domestic and commercial matters had twisted together. We wandered, stooping, from wooden cubicle to wooden cubicle, poking at old machinery and the sleeping bags neatly laid out in the sleeping quarters. </p> <p>The shelves in what was probably the kitchen were stocked with Bronco toilet paper, Sunlight Soap and Pearce Duff's custard powder. Its homely crudeness was a reminder of how inhuman a place Antarctica is, something you could forget when admiring ice packs from the comfort of a cruise ship.

Some 98% is covered in ice. </p> <p>\u0095 The highest mountains top 14,000ft. Average altitude is over 8,000ft. </p> <p>\u0095 The Antarctic ice sheet contains 70% of the world's fresh water and 91% of the world's ice. If melted, it would raise the global sea level by 200ft. </p> <p>\u0095 Precipitation is less than 2 inches a year, only slightly more than the Sahara desert. </p> <p>\u0095 Winds can reach 200mph. An earthquake on March 25 1998 registered 8.1 on the Richter scale, the highest ever recorded. </p> <p>\u0095 Temperatures average 0-5C in summer. The lowest recorded winter temperature is -90C. </p> <p>\u0095 The South Magnetic Pole is moving northwest at the rate of 6-9 miles per year. </p> <p>\u0095 The largest Antarctic iceberg measured 86 by 22 nautical miles. </p> <p>\u0095 There are six species of seal (crabear, fur, ross, southern elephant and weddell), seven species of penguin (Adelie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo, king, macaroni and rockhopper) but no polar bears. The largest indigenous land creature is a midge. </p> <p>\u0095 The Adelie penguin was named after the wife of French Antarctic explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who also discovered the Venus de Milo. </p> <p>\u0095 Flora consists of lichens, mosses, algae and fungi.

If melted, it would raise the global sea level by 200ft. \u0095 Precipitation is less than 2 inches a year, only slightly more than the Sahara desert. \u0095 Winds can reach 200mph. An earthquake on March 25 1998 registered 8.1 on the Richter scale, the highest ever recorded. \u0095 Temperatures average 0-5C in summer. The lowest recorded winter temperature is -90C. \u0095 The South Magnetic Pole is moving northwest at the rate of 6-9 miles per year. \u0095 The largest Antarctic iceberg measured 86 by 22 nautical miles. \u0095 There are six species of seal (crabear, fur, ross, southern elephant and weddell), seven species of penguin (Adelie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo, king, macaroni and rockhopper) but no polar bears. The largest indigenous land creature is a midge. \u0095 The Adelie penguin was named after the wife of French Antarctic explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who also discovered the Venus de Milo. \u0095 Flora consists of lichens, mosses, algae and fungi. There are only two flowering plants, the Antarctic hair grass and the Antarctic pearlwort. \u0095 Captain John Davis of the Connecticut sealer Huron is said to be the first person to have set foot on the continent at Hughes Bay on February 7 1821. The first authenticated landing was by Norwegians Henrich Bull and Carsten Borchgrevink from the ship Antarctic at Cape Adare on January 18, 1895. \u0095 Antarctica has a human population of 2,000 in summer, 800 in winter.

But the chances are you'll just want to loll on the lawns after a couple of hours of the Hall of the Halbardiers with Tresses, the Dormitory of the White Eunuchs (not much fun there, after lights out), the Door of Repentance or even the Harem (there's an extra charge, and always a queue). </p> <p>Mercifully close is Aya Sophia (the church of the Divine Wisdom). For 900 years it was a fabled domed basilica of Christian art and worship. But how quickly even great architecture can be adapted to new purpose! Three days after Mehmet II entered the city, the edifice had been adapted as a mosque, ready for prayers at Friday noon. Now, it's a monumental museum which you can enter for \u00a33. </p> <p>To see a proper prayed-in building, go to the Blue Mosque, which dates from the 16th century. Its massiveness and emptiness (except for the faithful) are its most impressive features. Both are rather negative attributes, which make it something of a disappointment.

If only: Something that could change the weather when I needed it and deviate me on to a good course, so that when I get to the other side of Japan and there is a thunderstorm looming, I wouldn't have to ditch in the sea but could carrry on. \u0095 To The Edge of Space, Memoirs of a Balloonist by Colin Prescot, is published by Boxtree at \u00a320.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Before you go </strong></p> <p> <strong> 1</strong> Never take more luggage than you can run with. </p> <p><strong>2</strong> Always take more money and fewer clothes than you think you'll need. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> How to pack: take one wheely suitcase, ideally small enough to pass as cabin baggage. Lay out the absolute bare minimum of clothing you think you can get away with for the type and length of trip. Pack half of it. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Always travel with a picture of a large English country house and make out it's yours. This works particularly well in the US and can lead to you getting laid. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Always travel with someone apparently more appetising to mosquitoes than yourself. </p> <p><strong>6</strong> Photocopy passport, credit cards, driver's licence, vaccination certificates, even airline tickets and travellers' cheques. Leave the copies with a friend at home who has a fax machine. If you have your documents stolen, you can have a copy faxed to the Embassy - which can issue you with a full replacement passport in 24 hours, instead of seven days. </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> Obvious but important - always take a credit card on holiday even if you think you have enough cash (so that you don't run out of money in Portugal, have to run away from the resort restaurant and live on melon and chips for three days.). </p> <p><strong> 8</strong> Check out whatsonwhen. com before you go away to find out about any interesting happenings in the place you're going. </p> <p><strong> 9</strong> Check the best route from the destination airport into town on the Web before you leave for the airport. </p> <p> <strong> 10</strong> Get an e-mail address you can access through the Internet, such as hotmail - in lots of traveller-type places, especially in south-east Asia, Internet access is easier to find and more reliable than a phone. </p> <p> <strong> 11</strong> If your mobile phone works where you're going, connect to an update service with your football club, so you'll get the scores by text message while you're away. </p> <p> <strong> 12</strong> Take a Palm Pilot loaded up with software from www:avantgo.com to pick up the Guardian wherever you travel. </p> <p> <strong> 13</strong> Get a BT chargecard. Cheaper phone calls from abroad without the hassle of finding coins. </p> <p><strong> 14</strong> Eat live yoghurt two weeks before you leave - it builds up a \"friendly\" bacteria in your system and you can then tolerate more things. </p> <p> <strong> 15</strong> Those anticipating travel sickness and who take travel sickness pills, do better if they start taking them two or three days prior, whatever the label says. This is particularly helpful in the case of Stugeron, the brand favoured by sailors, because of minimum side effects. </p> <p> <strong> 16</strong> Three days before flying, start using a nasal spray two to three times a day and again during the flight. Your sinuses will all clear up and you won't suffer from that horrible pain in your ears during landing. </p> <p> <strong> 17</strong> Take three tablets of Immodium with you: bungs you up for a good 24 hours. </p> <p> <strong> 18</strong> Unplug everything in your home before you leave. One of the most common disasters is a fire while you're away, and the most common cause of fire is electrical. </p> <p> <strong> 19 </strong> Always pack a pair of underpants in your carry-on luggage, just in case your suitcase is lost . . . </p> <p> <strong> 20</strong> Remember PMT - passports, money, tickets. </p> <p> <strong> 21 </strong> And finally . . . don't forget to cancel the milk and newspapers. Lock that small loo window. Tell your neighbours (if you trust them) that you're going away. Oh, and lock the front door behind you. </p> <p><strong> At the airport </strong></p> <p> <strong> 22</strong> Best way to get an upgrade: arrive on the lateish side, don't make a fuss till it's really late and then raise hell. The airline always overbooks on the assumption that some people won't turn up. They stick you in first class. Hurrah! </p> <p> <strong> 23</strong> If you're delayed at an airport or have got a transfer wait, you can pay to go into a first-class lounge. Different airlines charge different amounts, ranging from \u00a35 - \u00a315. In exchange, you get free coffee, croissants, juice, papers and even showers. And, of course, they're quiet. </p> <p> <strong> 24</strong> If you've got hours to kill in Hong Kong airport, the spa lounge costs $25 but, as well as showers and sofas, has free e-mail facilities, massage chairs for stiff backs and as much food and drink as you can eat (they even give you bottles of water to take on your next flight). </p> <p> <strong> 25</strong> Stuck waiting for a plane at JFK? Despite the name, anyone can get a check-up at Dentists for Airport Employees, a facility that serves passengers and employees alike. Call for an appointment (718-656 4747), or stop by room 2311 in terminal 4. </p> <p> <strong> 26</strong> At O'Hare airport in Chicago, there's Hilton's health club, where for $9, you can use the club's sauna, steam room, lap pool, and gym equipment. </p> <p> <strong> 27</strong> Use a strip of sticky tape to hold down the button on your alarm clock. Otherwise it goes off when you chuck your hand baggage on the X-ray machine and men with guns start twitching. </p> <p><strong> On the plane</strong></p> <p> <strong> 28</strong> If you're flying to the US, ask for a seat at the front of the plane so that you'll be among the first passengers off - that way, you'll beat the worst of the stand-behind-the-line visa queue. </p> <p> <strong> 29</strong> If you find you're hemmed in when you get on a plane, listen out for the captain starting his welcome chat, as that means all the passengers are on and it's time to jump up and find yourself a lovely row of empty seats to crash out on. </p> <p> <strong> 30</strong> On long flights, take your watch off and don't look at any clocks. If you're not aware of the time, you can just enjoy a glass of wine, watch some films, read some magazines, sleep a little. Next thing, you're landing. And drink lots of water, too. And take ear plugs. </p> <p> <strong> 31</strong> Or... as soon as you get on a long-haul flight, adjust your watch to the local time in your destination and act accordingly (ie sleep and eat according to the time zone you are travelling towards). </p> <p> <strong> 32</strong> If you're a nervous flyer, try a dab of lavender oil before take-off to quell anxiety and help you sleep. </p> <p> <strong> 33</strong> Take a pair of warm socks on the plane; take your shoes off as soon as you're in the air and put your socks on. Feet swell in the air and this helps make your journey more comfortable. </p> <p> <strong> 34</strong> Take a jumper on the plane. They're always colder than you think. </p> <p> <strong> 35</strong> Drink lots of water to combat jetlag. </p> <p> <strong> 36</strong> Try to get a seat at the front of the plane - the air is better than at the back. </p> <p> <strong> 37</strong> Get an exit seat - more legroom. </p> <p> <strong> 38</strong> On charter flights, buy a headset then take it on all future flights - one headset fits all planes. </p> <p> <strong> 39</strong> Buy a pair of noise-cancelling headphones. You can use them instead of the ones supplied by the airline. They don't eliminate all plane noise, but they're a big help. (Recommended: Sony MDR NC20 phones.) </p> <p> <strong> 40</strong> When you walk through first class to get off, look out for any goody bags that haven't been taken away - Virgin's Upper Class gives out lovely proper-sized Jo Malone smellies and Cathay Pacific's first-class kit has a fantastic velvet eye mask. </p> <p><strong> For the kids</strong></p> <p> <strong> 41</strong> Make sure you pack that favourite toy. Nothing beats a GameBoy unless it's two GameBoys and a link cable. </p> <p> <strong> 42 </strong> Take a two-day supply of favourite drinks. </p> <p> <strong> 43</strong> Always take a puncture repair kit: be the poolside hero when little Jeremy's inflatable dinosaur goes limp. </p> <p> <strong> 44</strong> Check about high chairs and cots. </p> <p> <strong> 45</strong> Include Calpol, wipes etc. </p> <p> <strong> 46</strong> Get youngsters into a routine as quickly as possible. </p> <p> <strong> 47</strong> Take Chuba Chips lollipops for take-off and landing so your ears pop properly. Also good to give to annoying, noisy children. Strawberry and vanilla is the connoisseur's flavour of choice. </p> <p> <strong> 48</strong> If you are forced to spend a few hours in Miami International airport between flights with children in tow, take them for a walk along the giant glass xylophone, which stretches between the main terminal and the British Airways departure gates. As you pass by the 20ft sheets of rainbow-coloured translucent glass, you become the hammer that \"plays\" the notes. It's the most fun you will ever have pretending to be Jean-Michel Jarre. It's free and the sound is pretty and soothing. </p> <p> <strong> 49</strong> Warning to the Florida-bound: Disney classes children aged 10 and over as adults. </p> <p> <strong> 50</strong> Take the babysitter. </p> <p><strong> For the fashionable</strong></p> <p> <strong> 51</strong> Buy a high-altitude moisturiser (Molten Brown) and apply on the plane every hour (and on your lips) - it helps avoid tight and dry skin when you get where you're going. It also makes it easier for women to apply make-up when nearing the end of a flight . . . therefore, you look better when meeting potential holiday friends. </p> <p> <strong> 52</strong> Body Butter from Body Shop is better than after-sun and comes in massive tubs for a couple of pounds, so much cheaper, too. </p> <p> <strong> 53</strong> Essential for all women: Think pink but pack black. </p> <p> <strong> 54</strong> Sunglasses are good for looking glamorous at the airport for upgrade purposes and also for hiding red-eye after overnight flights. </p> <p> <strong> 55 </strong> Always have St Tropez all-over fake tan done before you go somewhere hot, so that you don't look English and pale when you go sunbathing for the first few days. </p> <p> <strong> 56</strong> Beach etiquette 1: when sunbathing, lie on a sarong, not a towel. Towels take much longer to dry, and sand sticks to them. Not a good look. </p> <p> <strong> 57</strong> Beach etiquette 2: after swimming, forget the towel and dry off in the sun - by standing or wandering - before you lie down again. Otherwise sand will stick to your skin - very uncouth. </p> <p> <strong> 58</strong> No longer the height of fashion, maybe, but - for women - a soft, cosy pashmina is still de rigueur on long-haul flights. So much nicer than nasty, synthetic airline blankets. </p> <p> <strong> 59</strong> A thin cotton sarong is really useful as it can be used as a pillow case, sheet, towel, sunhat, shawl, bag, picnic rug, tablecloth, or, of course, a skirt. </p> <p> <strong> 60</strong> Beware of buying cheap silk in the Far East - it may turn out to be shimmering viscose (which you can identify by the way it burns: if it produces acrid smoke and little blobs of plastic, it's not real silk); in Bangkok, resist the lure of the Khao San Road and buy from the Silk Shop in the arcade at the Shangri La hotel. It has a huge selection of cloth and gorgeous shot silk cushion covers for about \u00a32.50. </p> <p> <strong> 61</strong> Don't turn your nose up at wheely luggage - so much better for your back. And prim flight-attendant chic is now very cool. </p> <p> <strong> 62</strong> To keep your clothes clean, take Spotkleen - brilliant stain-removing wipes from John Lewis. </p> <p> <strong> 63</strong> Always carry two metres of thin elastic shock cord, which can be used for anything from a makeshift clothesline to keeping your trousers up. </p> <p><strong> At the other end</strong></p> <p> <strong> 64</strong> Women travelling alone should take a wedding ring - a fake one if necessary - to prevent being hassled. A huge fake diamond ring (the kind you buy in Top Shop for a fiver) works even better, as people think you have a scary gangster fianc\u00e9. </p> <p> <strong> 65</strong> Mel Brooks in his 2,000-year-old man routine suggested \"never travel in a small Italian car\". He's right. </p> <p> <strong> 66</strong> Cover your Travel Guide so it doesn't get stolen and sold on and so you don't look such a tourist. </p> <p> <strong> 67</strong> If staying in a hotel, always befriend (and tip) the maid - she'll have all the local info and gossip. </p> <p> <strong> 68</strong> Make friends with the restaurant manager at the resort, learn his name and enjoy the best sea view every night. </p> <p> <strong> 69</strong> At all-inclusive hotels, if you want a bottle of water, ask at the restaurant where they will give you them free - in the shop, you will have to pay. </p> <p> <strong> 70</strong> Always leave your key at reception in hotels as men will invariably dive into the sea with it in their swimming trunks pocket. </p> <p> <strong> 71</strong> If you book a room at a Fairfield Inn or a Residence Inn next door to a larger, plusher Marriott resort hotel, you have full access to the hotel's amenities and room-charging privileges, which can make a huge difference to the holiday budget. </p> <p><strong> Money matters</strong></p> <p> <strong> 72</strong> In poor countries, go to a bank on arrival and get a large number of small-denomination notes. Keep large-denomination notes separate. Keep a small wad of small notes available in a pocket for tips, porters, beggars and all sorts of other people. Once they spot large notes, you will be killed in the rush. </p> <p> <strong> 73</strong> On trips to India and Sri Lanka, take loads of Biros to give to the children (plan about five a day). The girls also like make-up testers. </p> <p> <strong> 74</strong> In Rio, mugging capital of the world, carry a wad of small-denomination notes in an obvious place - back trouser pocket, shirt breast pocket - so when you are mugged, these notes are grabbed and the larger notes are still safe in an inside pocket. </p> <p> <strong> 75</strong> For women, if you're in a really dodgy area and are concerned that you're going to get fleeced, wrap up your money and cards in a plastic bag, then a sock, then pin the sock inside your knickers; just leave a bit of cash and one card out somewhere with your passport to look convincing. While it may sound gross, it makes you feel very safe if you're travelling long distances and will have to spend some of that time asleep. Money belts are too obvious and too easy to slice into. </p> <p> <strong> 76 </strong> Always have sterling or dollars with you; useful for extras, bribes etc. </p> <p> <strong> 77</strong> Don't buy travellers' cheques - clumsy and a waste of money - most countries have cashpoints now. (Check beforehand.) And most places take Visa - which often takes quite a long time to come through on the bill. </p> <p> <strong> 78</strong> In New Delhi and other large Indian cities (particularly Bombay and Calcutta), always go to the pre-paid taxi counter. These are regulated by the city authority and you state your destination and how many pieces of luggage you have. Customers are then given a receipt and are guided to a taxi outside where they are taken to the destination they have paid for. Don't give any more. </p> <p> <strong> 79</strong> Never buy coffee on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es - go one street away and pay a quarter of the price. </p> <p><strong> Survival instincts</strong></p> <p> <strong> 80</strong> For anyone either travelling to/from/between any of the gold triangle states (Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand), in which drug smuggling is a capital offence: on internal flights inside those states, should your luggage pop up on the airport reclaim with so much as one clip open, don't touch it; grab a customs officer/cop; inform them what has happened and that you have not touched the case; insist they search it thoroughly. It could save a lot of trouble (and worse) should someone actually have placed drugs in the luggage. </p> <p> <strong> 81</strong> Tropics only: four large jam jar lids. Put the feet of your bed in them, top up with water, and the ants can't climb up and bite your arse. </p> <p> <strong> 82</strong> For survival fantasists: carry a square of bright metal with a hole in it. When lost on the tundra, look through the hole at a passing aircraft and the reflecting sun will catch the pilot's attention. Nice idea, anyway. </p> <p> <strong> 83</strong> African camping safari tips: if confronted by a lion, stand stock still; if confronted by a rhino, climb the nearest tree; never look a leopard in the eye; and always drink half a bottle of Scotch before settling down in your tent for the night. </p> <p> <strong> 84</strong> Cute as they may look, hippos kill more people in Africa than any other animal. If you're out in a boat or camping in the bush, avoid them. They are extremely volatile. </p> <p> <strong> 85</strong> A few limes placed around your bed at night will keep the centipedes away. </p> <p> <strong> 86</strong> The only foolproof protection against the Highland midge? A pair of knotted tights slipped over the head, mugger-style. Even the most persistent beastie won't get through. Avoid fishnets. </p> <p> <strong> 87</strong> If you're going to a malarial country - and that currently includes most of Africa and large parts of Asia - eat lots of garlic. It's not a substitute for anti-malarial drugs, but mosquitoes seem to be as averse to garlicky fumes as we are. </p> <p><strong> For the view</strong></p> <p> <strong> 88</strong> Get to see the Statue of Liberty for next to nothing by boarding the Staten Island ferry ( for free) rather than paying top-whack on a regular cruise. You get to see Staten Island, too. </p> <p> <strong> 89</strong> When sailing from Scrabster to Orkney on the St Ola, stand on deck on the right (starboard) to gaze at the Old Man of Hoy; move to the left (port) as the boat turns into Scapa Flow to see the sun make long evening shadows over Stromness, a town almost as beautiful as Venice. This assumes the sun is shining, which is quite rare, and that you are not being seasick in a gale. </p> <p> <strong> 90</strong> The best view of the Spanish Steps in Rome is from the first floor of Prada. No other tourists, thus uninterrupted view . . . and lots of expensive shoes. </p> <p> <strong> 91</strong> Ignore open-top bus tours of London. Instead, board a southbound No 12 bus in Praed Street, Paddington. It passes Marble Arch, goes up Oxford Street, down Regent Street, through Trafalgar Square and over Lambeth bridge via Whitehall and Parliament Square. It then passes Lambeth Palace (top deck for best view of George Carey in his Speedos) and under the Eurostar terminal at Waterloo. Wealthy American tourists are advised to alight before they get too near the bottom of the Walworth Road. They should then cross the road and take a northbound number 12 asap. </p> <p> <strong> 92</strong> In Prague, the number 22 tram goes past a lot of the tourist sites in the city - the castle, the national theatre , through Mal\u00e1 Strana etc etc. </p> <p> <strong> 93</strong> Paris has very few green spaces, so if you're craving lush grass and fresh air and don't have time to make it to the suburbs, head for the garden at the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, near Hpital des Invalides. You pay a few sous for the peace and quiet and are surrounded by Rodin. </p> <p> <strong> 94</strong> In Berlin, dodge the hour-long queue to get into Norman Foster's new Reichstag by booking the restaurant on the roof terrace. If you have a reservation, they let you in a small side entrance with no hassle and you can spend as much time as you like in Norman's cupola. Whether you then keep the reservation is up to you - though it's a nice spot with great ice creams in particular. The Cupola and restaurant are open daily from 8am to midnight. For restaurant reservations call +49-30-226 29 90. </p> <p><strong> Sport</strong></p> <p> <strong> 95</strong> Diving aficionados on a budget: forget paying hundreds of pound for a diving course at the Red Sea or the Barrier Reef. The cheapest courses in the world are in Lake Malawi, from US$25 a day with qualified instructors. </p> <p> <strong> 96</strong> Rollerblading heaven takes place in Paris every Friday night from 10pm to 1am when the grands boulevards are closed to traffic and the bladers whizz through the Parisian streets. A smaller version is organised for beginners on Sunday afternoons, starting at Place Bastille. </p> <p><strong> Technicalities</strong></p> <p> <strong> 97 </strong> If you use a notebook computer, always carry UK/US and UK/Continental mains adaptors and a US phone plug adaptor. </p> <p> <strong> 98</strong> Instead of plugging the modem cable into the wall, see if you can plug it into a telephone handset. </p> <p> <strong> 99 </strong> Take a universal plug for baths and sinks. </p> <p><strong> They think it's all over</strong></p> <p> <strong> 100</strong> If at the end of your holiday, you have no money to buy snacks at the airport caf\u00e9, offer to buy someone else's duty free goods on your credit card in exchange for their cash, and then you can go on a munchies raid. </p> <p> <strong> 101</strong> If you've got this far and are still worried, then stay at home. </p> <p><strong> Ask a fellow traveller</strong></p> <p>Your fellow Guardian readers are some of the most travelled people and someone out there can help.

      "bodyText": "Before you go 1 Never take more luggage than you can run with. 2 Always take more money and fewer clothes than you think you'll need. 3 How to pack: take one wheely suitcase, ideally small enough to pass as cabin baggage. Lay out the absolute bare minimum of clothing you think you can get away with for the type and length of trip. Pack half of it. 4 Always travel with a picture of a large English country house and make out it's yours. This works particularly well in the US and can lead to you getting laid. 5 Always travel with someone apparently more appetising to mosquitoes than yourself. 6 Photocopy passport, credit cards, driver's licence, vaccination certificates, even airline tickets and travellers' cheques. Leave the copies with a friend at home who has a fax machine. If you have your documents stolen, you can have a copy faxed to the Embassy - which can issue you with a full replacement passport in 24 hours, instead of seven days. 7 Obvious but important - always take a credit card on holiday even if you think you have enough cash (so that you don't run out of money in Portugal, have to run away from the resort restaurant and live on melon and chips for three days.). 8 Check out whatsonwhen. com before you go away to find out about any interesting happenings in the place you're going. 9 Check the best route from the destination airport into town on the Web before you leave for the airport. 10 Get an e-mail address you can access through the Internet, such as hotmail - in lots of traveller-type places, especially in south-east Asia, Internet access is easier to find and more reliable than a phone. 11 If your mobile phone works where you're going, connect to an update service with your football club, so you'll get the scores by text message while you're away. 12 Take a Palm Pilot loaded up with software from www:avantgo.com to pick up the Guardian wherever you travel. 13 Get a BT chargecard. Cheaper phone calls from abroad without the hassle of finding coins. 14 Eat live yoghurt two weeks before you leave - it builds up a \"friendly\" bacteria in your system and you can then tolerate more things. 15 Those anticipating travel sickness and who take travel sickness pills, do better if they start taking them two or three days prior, whatever the label says. This is particularly helpful in the case of Stugeron, the brand favoured by sailors, because of minimum side effects. 16 Three days before flying, start using a nasal spray two to three times a day and again during the flight. Your sinuses will all clear up and you won't suffer from that horrible pain in your ears during landing. 17 Take three tablets of Immodium with you: bungs you up for a good 24 hours. 18 Unplug everything in your home before you leave. One of the most common disasters is a fire while you're away, and the most common cause of fire is electrical. 19 Always pack a pair of underpants in your carry-on luggage, just in case your suitcase is lost . . . 20 Remember PMT - passports, money, tickets. 21 And finally . . . don't forget to cancel the milk and newspapers. Lock that small loo window. Tell your neighbours (if you trust them) that you're going away. Oh, and lock the front door behind you. At the airport 22 Best way to get an upgrade: arrive on the lateish side, don't make a fuss till it's really late and then raise hell. The airline always overbooks on the assumption that some people won't turn up. They stick you in first class. Hurrah! 23 If you're delayed at an airport or have got a transfer wait, you can pay to go into a first-class lounge. Different airlines charge different amounts, ranging from \u00a35 - \u00a315. In exchange, you get free coffee, croissants, juice, papers and even showers. And, of course, they're quiet. 24 If you've got hours to kill in Hong Kong airport, the spa lounge costs $25 but, as well as showers and sofas, has free e-mail facilities, massage chairs for stiff backs and as much food and drink as you can eat (they even give you bottles of water to take on your next flight). 25 Stuck waiting for a plane at JFK? Despite the name, anyone can get a check-up at Dentists for Airport Employees, a facility that serves passengers and employees alike. Call for an appointment (718-656 4747), or stop by room 2311 in terminal 4. 26 At O'Hare airport in Chicago, there's Hilton's health club, where for $9, you can use the club's sauna, steam room, lap pool, and gym equipment. 27 Use a strip of sticky tape to hold down the button on your alarm clock. Otherwise it goes off when you chuck your hand baggage on the X-ray machine and men with guns start twitching. On the plane 28 If you're flying to the US, ask for a seat at the front of the plane so that you'll be among the first passengers off - that way, you'll beat the worst of the stand-behind-the-line visa queue. 29 If you find you're hemmed in when you get on a plane, listen out for the captain starting his welcome chat, as that means all the passengers are on and it's time to jump up and find yourself a lovely row of empty seats to crash out on. 30 On long flights, take your watch off and don't look at any clocks. If you're not aware of the time, you can just enjoy a glass of wine, watch some films, read some magazines, sleep a little. Next thing, you're landing. And drink lots of water, too. And take ear plugs. 31 Or... as soon as you get on a long-haul flight, adjust your watch to the local time in your destination and act accordingly (ie sleep and eat according to the time zone you are travelling towards). 32 If you're a nervous flyer, try a dab of lavender oil before take-off to quell anxiety and help you sleep. 33 Take a pair of warm socks on the plane; take your shoes off as soon as you're in the air and put your socks on. Feet swell in the air and this helps make your journey more comfortable. 34 Take a jumper on the plane. They're always colder than you think. 35 Drink lots of water to combat jetlag. 36 Try to get a seat at the front of the plane - the air is better than at the back. 37 Get an exit seat - more legroom. 38 On charter flights, buy a headset then take it on all future flights - one headset fits all planes. 39 Buy a pair of noise-cancelling headphones. You can use them instead of the ones supplied by the airline. They don't eliminate all plane noise, but they're a big help. (Recommended: Sony MDR NC20 phones.) 40 When you walk through first class to get off, look out for any goody bags that haven't been taken away - Virgin's Upper Class gives out lovely proper-sized Jo Malone smellies and Cathay Pacific's first-class kit has a fantastic velvet eye mask. For the kids 41 Make sure you pack that favourite toy. Nothing beats a GameBoy unless it's two GameBoys and a link cable. 42 Take a two-day supply of favourite drinks. 43 Always take a puncture repair kit: be the poolside hero when little Jeremy's inflatable dinosaur goes limp. 44 Check about high chairs and cots. 45 Include Calpol, wipes etc. 46 Get youngsters into a routine as quickly as possible. 47 Take Chuba Chips lollipops for take-off and landing so your ears pop properly. Also good to give to annoying, noisy children. Strawberry and vanilla is the connoisseur's flavour of choice. 48 If you are forced to spend a few hours in Miami International airport between flights with children in tow, take them for a walk along the giant glass xylophone, which stretches between the main terminal and the British Airways departure gates. As you pass by the 20ft sheets of rainbow-coloured translucent glass, you become the hammer that \"plays\" the notes. It's the most fun you will ever have pretending to be Jean-Michel Jarre. It's free and the sound is pretty and soothing. 49 Warning to the Florida-bound: Disney classes children aged 10 and over as adults. 50 Take the babysitter. For the fashionable 51 Buy a high-altitude moisturiser (Molten Brown) and apply on the plane every hour (and on your lips) - it helps avoid tight and dry skin when you get where you're going. It also makes it easier for women to apply make-up when nearing the end of a flight . . . therefore, you look better when meeting potential holiday friends. 52 Body Butter from Body Shop is better than after-sun and comes in massive tubs for a couple of pounds, so much cheaper, too. 53 Essential for all women: Think pink but pack black. 54 Sunglasses are good for looking glamorous at the airport for upgrade purposes and also for hiding red-eye after overnight flights. 55 Always have St Tropez all-over fake tan done before you go somewhere hot, so that you don't look English and pale when you go sunbathing for the first few days. 56 Beach etiquette 1: when sunbathing, lie on a sarong, not a towel. Towels take much longer to dry, and sand sticks to them. Not a good look. 57 Beach etiquette 2: after swimming, forget the towel and dry off in the sun - by standing or wandering - before you lie down again. Otherwise sand will stick to your skin - very uncouth. 58 No longer the height of fashion, maybe, but - for women - a soft, cosy pashmina is still de rigueur on long-haul flights. So much nicer than nasty, synthetic airline blankets. 59 A thin cotton sarong is really useful as it can be used as a pillow case, sheet, towel, sunhat, shawl, bag, picnic rug, tablecloth, or, of course, a skirt. 60 Beware of buying cheap silk in the Far East - it may turn out to be shimmering viscose (which you can identify by the way it burns: if it produces acrid smoke and little blobs of plastic, it's not real silk); in Bangkok, resist the lure of the Khao San Road and buy from the Silk Shop in the arcade at the Shangri La hotel. It has a huge selection of cloth and gorgeous shot silk cushion covers for about \u00a32.50. 61 Don't turn your nose up at wheely luggage - so much better for your back. And prim flight-attendant chic is now very cool. 62 To keep your clothes clean, take Spotkleen - brilliant stain-removing wipes from John Lewis. 63 Always carry two metres of thin elastic shock cord, which can be used for anything from a makeshift clothesline to keeping your trousers up. At the other end 64 Women travelling alone should take a wedding ring - a fake one if necessary - to prevent being hassled. A huge fake diamond ring (the kind you buy in Top Shop for a fiver) works even better, as people think you have a scary gangster fianc\u00e9. 65 Mel Brooks in his 2,000-year-old man routine suggested \"never travel in a small Italian car\". He's right. 66 Cover your Travel Guide so it doesn't get stolen and sold on and so you don't look such a tourist. 67 If staying in a hotel, always befriend (and tip) the maid - she'll have all the local info and gossip. 68 Make friends with the restaurant manager at the resort, learn his name and enjoy the best sea view every night. 69 At all-inclusive hotels, if you want a bottle of water, ask at the restaurant where they will give you them free - in the shop, you will have to pay. 70 Always leave your key at reception in hotels as men will invariably dive into the sea with it in their swimming trunks pocket. 71 If you book a room at a Fairfield Inn or a Residence Inn next door to a larger, plusher Marriott resort hotel, you have full access to the hotel's amenities and room-charging privileges, which can make a huge difference to the holiday budget. Money matters 72 In poor countries, go to a bank on arrival and get a large number of small-denomination notes. Keep large-denomination notes separate. Keep a small wad of small notes available in a pocket for tips, porters, beggars and all sorts of other people. Once they spot large notes, you will be killed in the rush. 73 On trips to India and Sri Lanka, take loads of Biros to give to the children (plan about five a day). The girls also like make-up testers. 74 In Rio, mugging capital of the world, carry a wad of small-denomination notes in an obvious place - back trouser pocket, shirt breast pocket - so when you are mugged, these notes are grabbed and the larger notes are still safe in an inside pocket. 75 For women, if you're in a really dodgy area and are concerned that you're going to get fleeced, wrap up your money and cards in a plastic bag, then a sock, then pin the sock inside your knickers; just leave a bit of cash and one card out somewhere with your passport to look convincing. While it may sound gross, it makes you feel very safe if you're travelling long distances and will have to spend some of that time asleep. Money belts are too obvious and too easy to slice into. 76 Always have sterling or dollars with you; useful for extras, bribes etc. 77 Don't buy travellers' cheques - clumsy and a waste of money - most countries have cashpoints now. (Check beforehand.) And most places take Visa - which often takes quite a long time to come through on the bill. 78 In New Delhi and other large Indian cities (particularly Bombay and Calcutta), always go to the pre-paid taxi counter. These are regulated by the city authority and you state your destination and how many pieces of luggage you have. Customers are then given a receipt and are guided to a taxi outside where they are taken to the destination they have paid for. Don't give any more. 79 Never buy coffee on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es - go one street away and pay a quarter of the price. Survival instincts 80 For anyone either travelling to/from/between any of the gold triangle states (Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand), in which drug smuggling is a capital offence: on internal flights inside those states, should your luggage pop up on the airport reclaim with so much as one clip open, don't touch it; grab a customs officer/cop; inform them what has happened and that you have not touched the case; insist they search it thoroughly. It could save a lot of trouble (and worse) should someone actually have placed drugs in the luggage. 81 Tropics only: four large jam jar lids. Put the feet of your bed in them, top up with water, and the ants can't climb up and bite your arse. 82 For survival fantasists: carry a square of bright metal with a hole in it. When lost on the tundra, look through the hole at a passing aircraft and the reflecting sun will catch the pilot's attention. Nice idea, anyway. 83 African camping safari tips: if confronted by a lion, stand stock still; if confronted by a rhino, climb the nearest tree; never look a leopard in the eye; and always drink half a bottle of Scotch before settling down in your tent for the night. 84 Cute as they may look, hippos kill more people in Africa than any other animal. If you're out in a boat or camping in the bush, avoid them. They are extremely volatile. 85 A few limes placed around your bed at night will keep the centipedes away. 86 The only foolproof protection against the Highland midge? A pair of knotted tights slipped over the head, mugger-style. Even the most persistent beastie won't get through. Avoid fishnets. 87 If you're going to a malarial country - and that currently includes most of Africa and large parts of Asia - eat lots of garlic. It's not a substitute for anti-malarial drugs, but mosquitoes seem to be as averse to garlicky fumes as we are. For the view 88 Get to see the Statue of Liberty for next to nothing by boarding the Staten Island ferry ( for free) rather than paying top-whack on a regular cruise. You get to see Staten Island, too. 89 When sailing from Scrabster to Orkney on the St Ola, stand on deck on the right (starboard) to gaze at the Old Man of Hoy; move to the left (port) as the boat turns into Scapa Flow to see the sun make long evening shadows over Stromness, a town almost as beautiful as Venice. This assumes the sun is shining, which is quite rare, and that you are not being seasick in a gale. 90 The best view of the Spanish Steps in Rome is from the first floor of Prada. No other tourists, thus uninterrupted view . . . and lots of expensive shoes. 91 Ignore open-top bus tours of London. Instead, board a southbound No 12 bus in Praed Street, Paddington. It passes Marble Arch, goes up Oxford Street, down Regent Street, through Trafalgar Square and over Lambeth bridge via Whitehall and Parliament Square. It then passes Lambeth Palace (top deck for best view of George Carey in his Speedos) and under the Eurostar terminal at Waterloo. Wealthy American tourists are advised to alight before they get too near the bottom of the Walworth Road. They should then cross the road and take a northbound number 12 asap. 92 In Prague, the number 22 tram goes past a lot of the tourist sites in the city - the castle, the national theatre , through Mal\u00e1 Strana etc etc. 93 Paris has very few green spaces, so if you're craving lush grass and fresh air and don't have time to make it to the suburbs, head for the garden at the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, near Hpital des Invalides. You pay a few sous for the peace and quiet and are surrounded by Rodin. 94 In Berlin, dodge the hour-long queue to get into Norman Foster's new Reichstag by booking the restaurant on the roof terrace. If you have a reservation, they let you in a small side entrance with no hassle and you can spend as much time as you like in Norman's cupola. Whether you then keep the reservation is up to you - though it's a nice spot with great ice creams in particular. The Cupola and restaurant are open daily from 8am to midnight. For restaurant reservations call +49-30-226 29 90. Sport 95 Diving aficionados on a budget: forget paying hundreds of pound for a diving course at the Red Sea or the Barrier Reef. The cheapest courses in the world are in Lake Malawi, from US$25 a day with qualified instructors. 96 Rollerblading heaven takes place in Paris every Friday night from 10pm to 1am when the grands boulevards are closed to traffic and the bladers whizz through the Parisian streets. A smaller version is organised for beginners on Sunday afternoons, starting at Place Bastille. Technicalities 97 If you use a notebook computer, always carry UK/US and UK/Continental mains adaptors and a US phone plug adaptor. 98 Instead of plugging the modem cable into the wall, see if you can plug it into a telephone handset. 99 Take a universal plug for baths and sinks. They think it's all over 100 If at the end of your holiday, you have no money to buy snacks at the airport caf\u00e9, offer to buy someone else's duty free goods on your credit card in exchange for their cash, and then you can go on a munchies raid. 101 If you've got this far and are still worried, then stay at home.

      "body": "<p>The first sight of a squadron of pelicans came as we crossed the three-mile causeway to Sanibel Island. Gliding at door height, a few metres away, a couple of them turned to look in the car, checking out the new neighbours for the week. They looked pre-historic and funny. We were all laughing by the time we reached the island. </p> <p>The next morning we were out on the beach early, taking a swim in the Gulf of Mexico when another flock glided past, just over our heads. And a couple of minutes later, when I had gone in to make breakfast, my wife returned to say that several dolphin had passed by within touching distance. And wasn't that an osprey sitting atop a lone pine? </p> <p>We had stumbled across an extraordinarily well-stocked island for wildlife, extraordinary, too, in that it also plays host to 20,000 holiday-makers in the busy winter months. But not many Brits. </p> <p>Sanibel Island, and its neighbour Captiva, are just off Fort Myers on Florida's Gulf of Mexico. Twelve miles long and three miles wide, Sanibel has 17 miles of beaches and 26 miles of bike-trails, virtually no crime and has easily enough attractions, most of them natural, to occupy a family of four for a week without any resort to television, GameBoys or theme parks. </p> <p>And we did not see a single big-eared mouse. </p> <p> <strong> What to do</strong> </p> <p> Watching the wildlife is a priority and there are two musts. First is to take the five-mile drive - or better still bike-ride - through the JN \"Ding\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge. Mr Darling was a political cartoonist by profession but an avid conservationist by choice. The 5,000-acre Refuge, occupying most of one side of the island, was established in 1945 and is stunning. Among the birds, we saw were roseate spoonbills, snowy egrets, anhingas, white ibises, cormorants, little blue herons and ospreys. There was a basking crocodile a few feet away at one point, although we missed the alligators. Remember to take binoculars. </p> <p>Early morning or late afternoon is best. It is too hot in the middle of the day. </p> <p>The second must is to explore the mangrove forests from a Canadian canoe - one of those ones seen on the top of American station wagons. You rent a canoe, for $20 (\u00a312) for two hours and $5 for each one after that, from Tarpon Bay and set off following a numbered trail into the waterways of the mangrove forest. We took one child in each boat and that worked out fine. The children thought it a great adventure paddling through the shallows, ducking under branches and avoiding those enveloping roots. Remember to take wide brimmed hats and insect repellent. </p> <p>The place is teeming with fish. Lots of people go and throw a line off the fishing pier down by Lighthouse Point, a quiet area on the eastern tip of the island. Depending on the season, there are mackerel, flounder, grouper, mangrove snapper, tarpon, trout and snook, around. The way to guarantee catching some fish and have a great ride with the wind in your hair is to hire a boat with a captain for the day or the afternoon. He will know where the fish are. We used Captain John Carpenito, and from the Back Bay we caught redfish, which lurk at the edge of the mangrove, and ladyfish which jump and twinkle in the sunlight when they take the bait. John had all the rods and the bait. The cost for four hours was $250. This may seem expensive but was worth it. While out there we saw tens of ospreys, a bald eagle, some dolphins and a manatee. Both boys caught something, which we then put back. </p> <p>The boats can also take you to remote beaches for another of Sanibel's major activities - shelling. The fact that the island lies east to west, rather than north to south, means that it acts a magnet for shells - hundreds of millions of them - making it one of the great places in the world for shelling. On any beach you see people walking slowly, slightly bent, eyes to the ground - the Sanibel stoop. Even novices like us picked up an incredible variety. A laminated beachcomber's field guide to the shells of the tropical Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for $8 was useful. The people out early seemed to do the best, and it made for pleasant conversation. By the end of the trip, we had so many that there had to be a ruthless clearing-out process. </p> <p>\u0095 The JN \"Ding\" Darling Refuge, off the Sanibel-Captiva road, is open every day except Fridays. Cars cost $5, hikers and bikes $1. Tarpon Bay Rentals and Tours, Tarpon Bay Road, tel: 941 472 8900. Captain John Carpenito, tel: ( home) 941 481 9423, (boat) 941 850 5939. </p> <p><strong> How to get about</strong></p> <p>Once on the island, cycling is the best way around and the 26 miles of bike trails make this easy. We hired bikes for the week. Nothing too fancy, as the place is flat. They deliver and pick up the bikes from your hotel or other accommodation. There is only one road on and off the island - the causeway with a $3 toll - and only one main road. It gets very busy at peak times. </p> <p>\u0095 Finnimores bike hire, 2353 Periwinkle Way, tel: 941 472 5577 (<a href=\"http://www.finnimores.com\">www.finnimores.com</a>). Five-speed bikes cost $35 for five to seven days. </p> <p><strong> Shopping</strong> </p> <p> There are several shopping centres along Periwinkle Way, the main street, most of them with shaded walkways and none of them feeling like an American mall. Shopping is mostly up-market - lots of jewellery, summer clothes, and beach gear. At the centre of the island is Jerry's Supermarket and shopping centre. They do classic American breakfasts in the diner there. </p> <p>\u0095 Jerry's, corner of Periwinkle and Casa Ybel, tel: 941 472 9300 (<a href=\"http://www.jerrysfoods.com\">www.jerrysfoods.com</a>). You can order online and it will be ready for you to pick up. </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong> </p> <p> We had a self-catering cottage so did a lot of barbecues with Jerry's supplying most of the goodies and lots of ready-made salads. There are more than 40 restaurants. Our blow-out was at the Thistle Lodge, which served slightly over-elaborate so-called Floribbean sea-food. A meal for four including one bottle of wine and cocktails was $180. </p> <p>Basic seafood and a grand view of spectacular sunsets can be had at the Lazy Flamingo just near the bridge to Captiva. Main courses are from $8 to $14. They will cook your own catch and provide the trimmings for $7.95. </p> <p>There are several Italian restaurants. Matzaluna does pizzas from a wood-fired oven for around $8 and pasta dishes from around $10. </p> <p>Most places have cocktail bars attached. Booking is advisable. </p> <p>\u0095 Thistle Lodge, West Gulf Drive, tel: 941 472 92000. Lazy Flamingo, 6520 Pine Avenue, tel: 941 472 5353. Matzaluna, 1200 Periwinkle Way, tel: 941 472 1998. Cooper's Cuisine-Scene restaurant guide magazine, available free at many locations, lists all the restaurants on Sanibel and Captiva with menus and prices (<a href=\"http://www.cuisine-scene.com\">www.cuisine-scene.com</a>) </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong> </p> <p> There are hotels, cottages and hundreds of condominiums to rent. We stayed at Gulf Breeze Cottages, a collection of 13 cottages directly on the beach. A two-bedroom cottage costs $1,925 a week in high season (December 15 - May 1) and $1,080 at other times, except national holidays. The Chamber of Commerce has lists of everywhere to stay, plus information on everything that moves. </p> <p>\u0095 The Sanibel-Captiva Island Chamber of Commerce, 1159 Causeway Road, Sanibel, Fla 33937, tel: 941 472 1080 (<a href=\"http://www.sanibel-captiva.org\">www.sanibel-captiva.org</a>).

Gliding at door height, a few metres away, a couple of them turned to look in the car, checking out the new neighbours for the week. They looked pre-historic and funny. We were all laughing by the time we reached the island. The next morning we were out on the beach early, taking a swim in the Gulf of Mexico when another flock glided past, just over our heads. And a couple of minutes later, when I had gone in to make breakfast, my wife returned to say that several dolphin had passed by within touching distance. And wasn't that an osprey sitting atop a lone pine? We had stumbled across an extraordinarily well-stocked island for wildlife, extraordinary, too, in that it also plays host to 20,000 holiday-makers in the busy winter months. But not many Brits. Sanibel Island, and its neighbour Captiva, are just off Fort Myers on Florida's Gulf of Mexico. Twelve miles long and three miles wide, Sanibel has 17 miles of beaches and 26 miles of bike-trails, virtually no crime and has easily enough attractions, most of them natural, to occupy a family of four for a week without any resort to television, GameBoys or theme parks. And we did not see a single big-eared mouse. What to do Watching the wildlife is a priority and there are two musts. First is to take the five-mile drive - or better still bike-ride - through the JN \"Ding\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge. Mr Darling was a political cartoonist by profession but an avid conservationist by choice. The 5,000-acre Refuge, occupying most of one side of the island, was established in 1945 and is stunning. Among the birds, we saw were roseate spoonbills, snowy egrets, anhingas, white ibises, cormorants, little blue herons and ospreys. There was a basking crocodile a few feet away at one point, although we missed the alligators. Remember to take binoculars. Early morning or late afternoon is best. It is too hot in the middle of the day. The second must is to explore the mangrove forests from a Canadian canoe - one of those ones seen on the top of American station wagons. You rent a canoe, for $20 (\u00a312) for two hours and $5 for each one after that, from Tarpon Bay and set off following a numbered trail into the waterways of the mangrove forest. We took one child in each boat and that worked out fine. The children thought it a great adventure paddling through the shallows, ducking under branches and avoiding those enveloping roots. Remember to take wide brimmed hats and insect repellent. The place is teeming with fish. Lots of people go and throw a line off the fishing pier down by Lighthouse Point, a quiet area on the eastern tip of the island. Depending on the season, there are mackerel, flounder, grouper, mangrove snapper, tarpon, trout and snook, around. The way to guarantee catching some fish and have a great ride with the wind in your hair is to hire a boat with a captain for the day or the afternoon. He will know where the fish are. We used Captain John Carpenito, and from the Back Bay we caught redfish, which lurk at the edge of the mangrove, and ladyfish which jump and twinkle in the sunlight when they take the bait. John had all the rods and the bait. The cost for four hours was $250. This may seem expensive but was worth it. While out there we saw tens of ospreys, a bald eagle, some dolphins and a manatee. Both boys caught something, which we then put back. The boats can also take you to remote beaches for another of Sanibel's major activities - shelling. The fact that the island lies east to west, rather than north to south, means that it acts a magnet for shells - hundreds of millions of them - making it one of the great places in the world for shelling. On any beach you see people walking slowly, slightly bent, eyes to the ground - the Sanibel stoop. Even novices like us picked up an incredible variety. A laminated beachcomber's field guide to the shells of the tropical Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for $8 was useful. The people out early seemed to do the best, and it made for pleasant conversation. By the end of the trip, we had so many that there had to be a ruthless clearing-out process. \u0095 The JN \"Ding\" Darling Refuge, off the Sanibel-Captiva road, is open every day except Fridays. Cars cost $5, hikers and bikes $1. Tarpon Bay Rentals and Tours, Tarpon Bay Road, tel: 941 472 8900. Captain John Carpenito, tel: ( home) 941 481 9423, (boat) 941 850 5939. How to get about Once on the island, cycling is the best way around and the 26 miles of bike trails make this easy. We hired bikes for the week. Nothing too fancy, as the place is flat. They deliver and pick up the bikes from your hotel or other accommodation. There is only one road on and off the island - the causeway with a $3 toll - and only one main road. It gets very busy at peak times. \u0095 Finnimores bike hire, 2353 Periwinkle Way, tel: 941 472 5577 (www.finnimores.com). Five-speed bikes cost $35 for five to seven days. Shopping There are several shopping centres along Periwinkle Way, the main street, most of them with shaded walkways and none of them feeling like an American mall. Shopping is mostly up-market - lots of jewellery, summer clothes, and beach gear. At the centre of the island is Jerry's Supermarket and shopping centre. They do classic American breakfasts in the diner there. \u0095 Jerry's, corner of Periwinkle and Casa Ybel, tel: 941 472 9300 (www.jerrysfoods.com). You can order online and it will be ready for you to pick up. Where to eat We had a self-catering cottage so did a lot of barbecues with Jerry's supplying most of the goodies and lots of ready-made salads. There are more than 40 restaurants. Our blow-out was at the Thistle Lodge, which served slightly over-elaborate so-called Floribbean sea-food. A meal for four including one bottle of wine and cocktails was $180. Basic seafood and a grand view of spectacular sunsets can be had at the Lazy Flamingo just near the bridge to Captiva. Main courses are from $8 to $14. They will cook your own catch and provide the trimmings for $7.95. There are several Italian restaurants. Matzaluna does pizzas from a wood-fired oven for around $8 and pasta dishes from around $10. Most places have cocktail bars attached. Booking is advisable. \u0095 Thistle Lodge, West Gulf Drive, tel: 941 472 92000. Lazy Flamingo, 6520 Pine Avenue, tel: 941 472 5353. Matzaluna, 1200 Periwinkle Way, tel: 941 472 1998. Cooper's Cuisine-Scene restaurant guide magazine, available free at many locations, lists all the restaurants on Sanibel and Captiva with menus and prices (www.cuisine-scene.com) Where to stay There are hotels, cottages and hundreds of condominiums to rent. We stayed at Gulf Breeze Cottages, a collection of 13 cottages directly on the beach. A two-bedroom cottage costs $1,925 a week in high season (December 15 - May 1) and $1,080 at other times, except national holidays. The Chamber of Commerce has lists of everywhere to stay, plus information on everything that moves. \u0095 The Sanibel-Captiva Island Chamber of Commerce, 1159 Causeway Road, Sanibel, Fla 33937, tel: 941 472 1080 (www.sanibel-captiva.org). Gulf Breeze Cottages, 1081 Shell Basket Lane, tel: 941 472 1626 (www.gbreeze.com) The practicals We flew to Miami on Virgin (\u00a31500 for two adults and two children), which is expensive, but we did it at the last minute for the Easter holiday and everything else had gone. Virgin Holidays (01293 456789, www.virginholidays.co.uk) has packages to Sanibel Island starting from \u00a3559pp for a week based on return flights, room only at the West Wind Inn and car hire. Children go from \u00a3249. Unijet (08705 336336) offers a one-week package for \u00a31199 for two adults and includes return flights direct to Fort Myers, car hire and room only at the Wets Wind Inn. Children go from \u00a3335 each.",

As final details of Thursday's council elections confirmed that William Hague's Tories had gained 600 seats, mainly at Labour's expense, Labour and the Liberal Democrats shared one comfort. Tactical anti-Tory voting in the Romsey byelection produced a convincing Liberal Democrat majority of 3,311 in south Hampshire. Such a defeat on a 60% turnout, double the disappointing rate elsewhere, is certain to dent Mr Hague's new populist tactics on immigration and asylum as the general election looms, especially when contrasted with the leftwing populism successfully promoted by the former GLC leader. Hours after the long-delayed confirmation that he had won enough second-preference votes to beat off the Tory Steve Norris's late surge, mayor-elect Livingstone staged a chaotically informal first press conference in his temporary HQ at Westminster. He used it to announce his title - he wants to be addressed as \"Ken\" - and that he will be offering key posts in his administration to rival mayoral candidates, including the post of London's \"poverty tsar\" to Frank Dobson. They had all fought for \"the city we love\", he explained. The new mayor also revealed urgent plans to meet two senior ministers, John Prescott and Stephen Byers, next week to discuss Ford's threatened factory closure at Dagenham - an early pointer to the interventionist style he will deploy to radicalise New Labour's economic policies. \"I am overwhelmed that London has given me a mandate against the three most powerful party machines in Britain,\" Mr Livingstone told reporters before walking through the streets of London cheered by supporters.

He returned to Britain to study at Imperial College where he rose to become president of the National Union of Students. Married with two daughters, Phillips is a close friend of Peter Mandelson who was best man at his wedding. He will ensure that the assembly does not lose sight of race issues. </p> <p><b> Angie Bray</b> Con, West Central<br> </p> <p>A former presenter on LBC radio, Bray will have little difficulty in establishing herself as the most prominent Tory in the assembly. </p> <p>She is a popular figure at Westminster where she was an endless source of gossip during her time as Chris Patten's press secretary in the early 1990s. Since then she has become a successful lobbyist for firms such as Boeing and Thames Water. </p> <p>Bray, who lives in Kensington with her partner Nigel, is one of the most popular Tory socialites in London. </p> <p>Their dinner parties in London and their country house in Gloucestershire are a must for leading shadow ministers and journalists attracted by the gossip. </p> <p>Since the election, Bray has become a close lieutenant of the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, who won promotion as shadow chancellor in 1998 after she launched a successful lobbying campaign on his behalf. </p> <p>She and her partner recently survived a horrific car crash on their way back to London from their country house. </p> <p><b> Lady (Sally) Hamwee</b> Lib Dem, London list<br> </p> <p>As Susan Kramer's deputy in the mayoral contest, Hamwee is likely to emerge as the leader of the Lib Dem group in the new assembly. </p> <p>A stalwart of the London party for nearly 30 years - she has been a Richmond councillor since 1978 - Hamwee was rewarded with a peerage by Paddy Ashdown in 1991. In her manifesto Hamwee, 53, promised to be a \"critical friend\" of the mayor. \"Old-style confrontational politics won't work,\" she said. \"But members must stand up to the mayor if necessary.\" </p> <p>A solicitor with the entertainment and media firm of solicitors Clintons, Hamwee is the Lib Dems' environment spokeswoman in the House of Lords. She won her spurs as a party activist by camnpaigning on grassroots issues. In her manifesto she boasts of widening a level crossing for pedestrians, clearing up litter - \"and donning rubber gloves to do it\" - and restricting lorries. </p> <p><b> Darren Johnson </b> Green, London list<br> </p> <p> Johnson, who ran a strong campaign in the mayoral race, will be one of the liveliest members of the assembly. The PhD student will invigorate proceedings with his plans to impose a 20mph speed limit across London and a daily \u00a310 charge on motorists to drive into town. </p> <p>During the election Johnson, 33, has liaised closely with Ken Livingstone who may at some time make him his deputy or award him the environment portfolio. Until he stood as the Green candidate for mayor, his great est claim to fame was his successful infiltration of the military base at Aldershot, dressed as Ivan the Terrible, during an arms fair. </p> <p>The guards were so taken by Johnson that they saluted him as he drove through the gates in a large limousine with tinted windows. \"I looked the part so they just waved me through,\" he recalls. \"Then I took out all these briefcases full of Monopoly money and tried to buy weapons.\" </p> <p><b> Lord (Toby) Harris of Haringey</b> Lab, Brent and Harrow<br> </p> <p> Harris, 46, will be one of the key Labour figures in the assembly who will be relied on by Downing Street to try to rein in Ken Livingstone. </p> <p>As chairman of the Association of London Government and leader of Haringey council since 1987, Harris is a Blairite loyalist who was rewarded with a life peerage in 1998. </p> <p>Throughout the election campaign the Labour peer has gone to great lengths to present himself as plain Toby Harris, to the amusement of the Tories who have insisted on referring to him by his formal title. </p> <p>Married with two teenage sons and a baby daughter, Harris has lived in London all his life and has served as a Labour councillor since 1978. He was director of the Association of Community Health Councils from 1987-1998. </p> <p>Although loyal to the party leadership, Harris played a leading role in the House of Lords in forcing the government to abandon its plan for a \u00a310,000 bond for Asian visitors to Britain. </p> <p><b> Bob Neill</b> Con, Bexley and Bromley<br> </p> <p>Neill will be forgiven for feeling a tinge of nostalgia when he takes up his seat in the assembly - he is one of the few members who served in the old Greater London council. A bachelor who lives on the Isle of Dogs, Neill says he will keep a close eye on the new mayor: \"The key issues are to ensure that the GLA is a value-for-money authority for London.\" </p> <p>Neill, 47, also promises to champion the London suburbs in the assembly to confront the perceived \"zone one\" outlook of Ken Livingstone. \"I want to make sure it is a proper voice for the outer London boroughs and the suburbs - which the GLC was not,\" he says. \"One of the key issues is transport and I want a fare deal for rail users coming into London from the suburbs.

      "body": "<p>Discussion at two of the editor's morning conferences this week was dominated by the way in which recent events had been covered on our website. Firstly, concern was raised about an audio tape, which we made available from 2.30pm on Monday, describing - somewhat ahead of our rivals - the wrecking of McDonald's restaurant in Whitehall. </p> <p>This had been fed in over a mobile telephone by a freelance journalist dispatched by us to report the May Day demonstrations. His account was recorded and put on the website after only a brief delay.

      "bodyText": "Discussion at two of the editor's morning conferences this week was dominated by the way in which recent events had been covered on our website. Firstly, concern was raised about an audio tape, which we made available from 2.30pm on Monday, describing - somewhat ahead of our rivals - the wrecking of McDonald's restaurant in Whitehall. This had been fed in over a mobile telephone by a freelance journalist dispatched by us to report the May Day demonstrations. His account was recorded and put on the website after only a brief delay. It was followed later by a link to video material provided by an organisation called Undercurrents. Among the questions raised at the conference, by someone who had not seen or heard any of this material at that time, were: are we confident that we are not appearing to condone criminal activity?; did we know, and did we tell visitors to the website, exactly where the material was coming from? The reporter, who provided what was in fact a perfectly straightforward description of the attack on McDonald's, works frequently for the Guardian and is respected as a conscientious and trustworthy contributor. The principal merit of his commentary was its immediacy. The quality of the sound was poor and the tape would not have been considered broadcastable by, say, the BBC, but the piece suggested no reason whatsoever for questioning the motivation of the reporter. To come to the video, Undercurrents describes itself as an alternative news organisation and uses the slogan: \"Stop drinking from the mainstream.\" Its starting point is frustration at what it calls the established media's \"lack of concern and analysis in reporting environmental and social issues\". Its video footage is supplied by \"activists at the forefront of local and global campaigns\".

Around her milled concert-going Czechs sipping Bohemian sekt (sparkling wine) at 75p a glass. </p> <p>I knew she was unhappy because I had sat next to her in the first half of the sober Dvorak Hall of the Rudolfinum, Prague's main concert venue. Locked in some private misery, she had not responded to quartets by Beethoven and Prokofiev, despite committed playing from the American Borromeo Quartet. For her, the Prague Spring, the city's annual music festival, had become deep winter. </p> <p>Her boyfriend kept trying to hold her hand, but she wouldn't let him; perhaps he was her problem. </p> <p>Things did not get better after the interval, when Josef Suk, Dvorak's grandson, joined the quartet for Dvorak's string quintet op 97. (I later bought a Supraphon CD of the piece at the Bonton megastore at the bottom of Wenceslas Square; Supraphons are very cheap in Prague.) </p> <p>The quintet is warm and smiling, full of Dvorak's American tunes, which are not American at all. </p> <p>We had two encores and I caught two trams home, hoping the pair might solve their problems on a May night too balmy for arguments. Perhaps they walked together over Charles Bridge, dropped down the steps on to the island called Kampa and fell into each other's arms in a quiet byway near the Maltese Gardens. </p> <p>Or perhaps next day they wandered off to Nov\u00e9 Mesto (New Town) to find the Villa Amerika, a house that honours Dvorak even though he never lived there. They could have moved together through the house, admiring the composer's trilby, stiff cuffs and hanky embroidered with a D, and inspecting a plan of the seating of the Cambridge ceremony at which Dvorak was awarded an honorary degree and during which he sat next to the composer Charles Villiers Stanford. </p> <p>My train of thought was broken by the clanks of the number 12 tram that took me back to the flat, where I played Le Jazz by Bohuslav Martinu (on another five quid Supraphon CD from Bonton). This four-minute piece, composed in 1926 as a recreation of the sound of the Paul Whiteman Band, sends itself up with a wordless chorus and is the perfect antidote to sentimentality. </p> <p>I forgot the sad lovers and set off to find the unlikely home in Bohemia where Martinu spent his early years. I had to go the long way round via Moravia where I kept bumping into Mahler. First in Jihlava, where he spent most of his boyhood, and then in Olomouc where, in 1883 at the age of 23, he directed the local opera company for a few months. He made his mark: they hated him, he hated them. </p> <p>Olomouc remembers Mahler in a caf\u00e9 named after him on the far side of Horni namesti; close by lies Mahlerova, a narrow lane of tatty buildings and few street lamps. A plaque on a ruin of a house with broken windows appears to suggest Mahler lived here. </p> <p>Policka, in eastern Bohemia, makes rather more fuss of Martinu, a local hero who was born in the town in 1890 and was re-buried there in 1979, 20 years after he died in Switzerland. Martinu is not in the premier league, and his music ranges from big-tune romanticism to nervy restlessness; but his voice is both individual and lovable and much of his work is available in excellent (and cheap) Czech recordings. </p> <p>And his claim to fame is that he was born in a room 192 steps up the spiky-topped tower of St Jakub's church in the town centre and lived there with his mother, father, sister and brother for nine years. It's said that when he finally came down to earth he was amazed by the size of people. </p> <p>Martinu's father Ferdinand had been appointed town fire warden after a disastrous blaze that caused much destruction in Policka. His duties were to keep watch day and night, wind up the tower clock and ring the evening bell. If he spotted a blaze, he had to bellow \"Fire!\" through a megaphone from the tower balcony. </p> <p>I paid my fee at the town museum (which has an excellent pictorial record of Martinu's life and career) and was led across town by the guide. </p> <p>She unlocked the church door and we climbed up spiralling stone steps to where the five bells hang (and where the Martinu family had their lavatory). We went through a big white door and continued climbing, first up wooden steps and then up angled ladders to the balcony, with its views of the town hall, town walls and fields beyond. </p> <p>The guide opened another door and we were allowed into a vestibule but not into the room itself. It was about 18ft by 12ft and lit by several windows. There were two beds, a table, chest, sofa and rocking horse, plus pious pictures and a crucifix. And a bell to tell of visitors below. But no tap: where did Mr and Mrs Martinu wash? </p> <p>I headed back (past a rather camp statue of frock-coated Smetana in his home town of Litomsyl) to Pardubice, where the editor of the local paper gave a me a tape of the town's chamber orchestra playing Martinu's Toccata e due Canzone. </p> <p>You could call it an explosive performance: Pardubice is where they make Semtex.</p> <p><strong>Five best restaurants</strong></p> <p>1 <strong> Franz Kafka Caf\u00e9 </strong><br> In the Josefov.

It's possible to do this via an agency, such as STA Travel, but it should be feasible on the web, too. </p> <p>Unfortunately, even overlooking a shameful abuse of prepositions and mangled translations, reliable timetable information - let alone booking - is even rarer than a punctual Virgin train. Many sites are aimed at the US market and offer discounts exclusively to impressionable would-be inter-railers. And the bigger sites have put all their efforts into assimilating flights and tended to overlook other means of transport. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.eurostar.com\">Eurostar </a> <br> Two genuinely useful sections lie amid the flotsam: the timetable and the new booking facility. Critics might say that the site would benefit from a redesign, but they obviously didn't visit it a year ago. If you register an e-mail address, which is a requirement if you intend to book a ticket, Eurostar will send you details of special offers. Eurostar now travels direct to the Alps on the twice-weekly Ski Train. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sncf.fr/indexe.htm\">SNCF</a> <br> Despite some minor glitches and poor translations, the SNCF is a rather useful service: you can book tickets in most EU countries, although certain discounts (such as Decouverte for the under-25s) are not given as options. However, given that the automatic ticket machines at French stations do not accept most British credit cards, booking ahead is still sensible. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.b-rail.be/E/\">Belgian Railways</a> <br> Only of interest if you are travelling within Belgium, the SNCB site is clumsy and uninspiring. Much of the information available is of dubious interest, although you will find timetables. Try the travel formulas page for details of passes for foreigners, including the exclusive Day Out in Ardennes. (Ardennes recently came bottom in L'Express magazine's survey of the quality of life in every French region). </p> <p><a href=\"http://bahn.hafas.de/bin/query.exe/en\">Deutsche Bahn</a><br> Astonishingly rapid, simple and efficient, the Deutsche Bahn search extends to trans-European services, although it does not always provide prices. Booking is also possible for services within Germany. </p> <p><a href=\"http://interrailer.net/english/\">InterRail</a><br> An amateurish shared resource for inter-railers; the idea is to swap information or find a travelling partner. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.railconnection.com\">Rail Connection</a> <br> The travelling tips here are poor, and the chief attraction is a virtual online conductor who can sell you an appropriate European rail pass. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.renfe.es/ingles/\">Renfe</a> <br> Timetables and a virtual tour of the Spanish railway system's trains are the main features. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.trans-siberian.co.uk/transsib.html\">Trans-Siberian</a><br> Unlike its airline counterpart Aeroflot, the Trans-Siberian Express has not yet acquired its own site. Built by enthusiastic fans of the service, this is an evocative alternative and can also sell you a package deal. The accompanying music, however, is execrable and has the uncanny ability to automatically turn up a computer's speakers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Judging from your emails, Guardian readers are keen train travellers and would like to be able to book trips across Europe by rail. It's possible to do this via an agency, such as STA Travel, but it should be feasible on the web, too. Unfortunately, even overlooking a shameful abuse of prepositions and mangled translations, reliable timetable information - let alone booking - is even rarer than a punctual Virgin train. Many sites are aimed at the US market and offer discounts exclusively to impressionable would-be inter-railers. And the bigger sites have put all their efforts into assimilating flights and tended to overlook other means of transport. Eurostar Two genuinely useful sections lie amid the flotsam: the timetable and the new booking facility. Critics might say that the site would benefit from a redesign, but they obviously didn't visit it a year ago. If you register an e-mail address, which is a requirement if you intend to book a ticket, Eurostar will send you details of special offers. Eurostar now travels direct to the Alps on the twice-weekly Ski Train. SNCF Despite some minor glitches and poor translations, the SNCF is a rather useful service: you can book tickets in most EU countries, although certain discounts (such as Decouverte for the under-25s) are not given as options. However, given that the automatic ticket machines at French stations do not accept most British credit cards, booking ahead is still sensible. Belgian Railways Only of interest if you are travelling within Belgium, the SNCB site is clumsy and uninspiring. Much of the information available is of dubious interest, although you will find timetables. Try the travel formulas page for details of passes for foreigners, including the exclusive Day Out in Ardennes. (Ardennes recently came bottom in L'Express magazine's survey of the quality of life in every French region). Deutsche Bahn Astonishingly rapid, simple and efficient, the Deutsche Bahn search extends to trans-European services, although it does not always provide prices. Booking is also possible for services within Germany. InterRail An amateurish shared resource for inter-railers; the idea is to swap information or find a travelling partner. Rail Connection The travelling tips here are poor, and the chief attraction is a virtual online conductor who can sell you an appropriate European rail pass. Renfe Timetables and a virtual tour of the Spanish railway system's trains are the main features. Trans-Siberian Unlike its airline counterpart Aeroflot, the Trans-Siberian Express has not yet acquired its own site. Built by enthusiastic fans of the service, this is an evocative alternative and can also sell you a package deal. The accompanying music, however, is execrable and has the uncanny ability to automatically turn up a computer's speakers.",

For a top boy to establish his mettle, there's going to be any number of nail-biting, near-death experiences to contend with, and wheezing on the floor feeling sick as the bad guy gets the girl isn't going to impress anyone. Sadly, for the biggest of big men, the world can - indeed must - be a parlous, hostile place; tastiness in a ruck is, therefore, pretty much statutory (otherwise, Ben Kingsley would have been deluged with action movie roles after Gandhi). On the other hand, no one wants to see their icon showing too much lust for glory. Too much lust for glory means revelling in the bloodshed, and revelling in the bloodshed means psycho, plain and simple. The same logic partially explains the recent box-office expiry of Arnold Schwarzenegger, as the world finally realised what he always was: a dead-eyed Teutonic Muscle Mary with all the charisma of a Dalston bouncer.

It's no good expecting to browbeat the audience into doe-eyed adulation when they've seen you dabbling in office stationery.

I was a real lefty figure.\"</p> <p>Sulston, whose father, Ted, worked for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, in London, and whose mother, Muriel, was a schoolteacher, fell into science after what he admits was a fairly undistinguished undergraduate degree at Cambridge between 1960-63. \"I never regarded myself, and I'm not an especially bright person, more of an artisan than an intellectual. I tried to go off with VSO and was signed up for some programme that collapsed. So, at the end of the summer term, without any particular plan, I asked about doing a PhD. And they said, 'Oh fine, come along in' - this was the 60s. That was tremendous. I did not like book work, I never have liked book work. What I actually liked was being in the lab and playing with the toys. I just played and played and played.\"</p> <p>Sulston's scientific awakening came in California. \"I was spoilt at the Salk Institute. I was the post-doc who got all the goodies. You were invited to have dinner with Nobel prize winners, made to feel bigger than your boots. I was absolutely in love with California. I loved staying at home, having babies, going to the beach - we bought a pick-up and put the pram in the back - and growing runner beans.\"</p> <p>In 1969, Sulston returned to Cambridge and its world-famous molecular biology laboratory, where DNA was originally discovered. In California, he had worked on nucleic acids - how genetic inheritance might get going - but techniques were primitive. He made his scientific name with a detailed study of a tiny worm, Caenorhabditis elegans.</p> <p>There are thousands of these little worms, also known as ringworms, in every handful of soil, where they eat bacteria. As part of a research project examining the worm's genome, Sulston had the simple but audacious idea of tracing the \"choreography\" of the way the cells divided by just watching them hatch through a Nomarski light microscope, that magnifies at 2,000 times.</p> <p>Every human starts off as one cell, a fertilised egg, but our cells soon divide, spine, bones, eyes, kidney, blood and hair. Understanding the lineage of how our cells specialise is fundamental to understanding genetics. Even in C. elegans, with just 1,000 cells, it is a complex process. For 18 months, Sulston shut himself in a small room and watched worms hatch. \"No one thought it was possible. Various people had looked at taking photographs, cutting and staining. But the resolution was not good enough. I twigged I could do it just by sitting and looking, so I did.\"</p> <p>It was mind-numbing, fastidious work. Sulston fondly still keeps his old microscope in his office. In true British fashion, Sulston describes his work as \"not the top stuff, the breakthrough that leads to Nobel prizes, but solid middle-of-the-road science\". The results were published in 1983, and Sulston, with his US collaborator Bob Waterston, who heads the other major genome sequencing centre in the University of Washington, St Louis, moved on to map the worms' genes.</p> <p>Although the nematode is tiny, its genome is still 100 million bases long. That is 100 million Cs, As, Gs and Ts. Decoding a genome is a bit like doing a very big jigsaw. In gene mapping, the genome is first divided up into big chunks - with the human genome there will be 22,000 segments, 150,000 letters long - and then each segment is analysed and their sequence, CATTGCC, read off. Because researchers know which big bit the individual sequence comes from, it's easier to put the whole jigsaw back together. Sulston and Waterston, viewed by James Watson at NIH as the best sequence team in the world, began sequencing the worm in 1990 as a test run for the human genome. The C. elegans genome was finally published in 1998. It was the first genome of a free-living animal ever decoded.</p> <p>By then, a forerunner of the current war over the human genome between Sulston, his collaborator Waterston, and Venter had already broken out. At his research institute, TIGR, Venter was producing a library of ESTs - valuable biotech material indicating the site of potential human genes - and TIGR's funders, Human Genome Sciences, sold the exclusive rights to consult this library to big pharmaceuticals such as SmithKline Beecham. The five-year deal with SmithKline Beecham alone was worth $125m. HGS was effectively operating a monopoly and demanding \"reach-through\" royalties; anyone who used its material and subsequently came up with a commercial application for a drug had to pay HGS a royalty. Academic researchers unable to pay the fees were locked out. Most of the data was sitting in closed computer files, waiting for paying customers.</p> <p>SmithKline Beecham's drug rivals, Merck, struck back. Rather than pay HGS fees, they gave Waterston a research grant to sequence a rival EST library and lodge them for free in Genbank - a public depository for genetic material and accessible to anyone. Overnight, it destroyed the economic value of HGS's precious library. \"Everything they do seems to have more of a political lean to it than just science. Waterston was a willing employee, or just part of someone else's game plan, in the contest between giant pharmaceutical companies,\" says Venter provocatively.</p> <p>But for Sulston, the open publication of the EST data was the ideal outcome. \"The human genome is vastly more complex, and its implications far greater, than anything we have encountered before. There is no way it should be concentrated in the hands of the few - that is exactly where Bolshevism went wrong. The human genome should be spread out laterally. We want competition on the products, not on the information itself.\"</p> <p>At TIGR, Venter had been developing a new way of sequencing genomes, called the \"whole shotgun method\" that relied on powerful computers and complex algorithms to reassemble tiny fragments without the aid of the gene-mapping sequences used by Sulston. Instead of first using big bits of the jigsaw, Venter just cloned the whole genome and then blasted it in small fragments. These fragments were then fed directly into sequencing machines and reassembled by concentrated computer power. In 1994, he used the shotgun method to sequence the micro-organism Haemophilus influenzae, the bug that gives children ear infection. It was the first actual organism, rather than an animal such as the worm, ever to be sequenced. Other bugs, syphilis and the bacteria that live in sulphur vents on the bottom of the ocean, followed.</p> <p>Again Venter came under attack for his methods. Critics claimed the shotgun method was imprecise - shotgunning the human genome leaves you with 60 million gene fragments, 2,000-10,000 letters long, to put back together again. His opponents claimed shotgunning would leave gaps in the sequence data, and would be unable to cope with larger genomes. But again Venter was triumphantly vindicated when, in collaboration with public scientists from Berkeley in California, he published the 120-million base genome of the fruit fly - important in genetic research - in March 2000.</p> <p>In 1997, Venter fell out badly with HGS's boss, Bill Haseltine, over the company's secretive business plan and ended their collaborative relationship. Haseltine and Venter swiftly became deadly rivals. Venter was out in the commercial cold again, lobbying for grants to sequence genomes from his academic enemies.</p> <p>But then his old partners, Applied Biosystems, saved him. In 1998, Perkin Elmer finally completed a new sequencing machine, the AB3700, that could sequence at hundreds of times the rate of earlier machines. Sequencing the human genome was just a question of lining up enough AB3700s - Celera has 300 of them - and turning them on. Perkin Elmer's Mike Hunkapiller, who developed the machines from their infancy, called Venter to head the new company. Big business was going to do the genome.</p> <p>In May 1998, Celera, which means swiftness, announced it would sequence the human code of life by 2001. Venter was his usual antagonistic self. \"There was a suggestion that the public project should move on to the mouse, and that Celera would take care of the human,\" says Francis Collins, current head of the US government Genome Research Institute and a former colleague of Venter's. \"Craig Venter does not lack for ambition or audacity.\"</p> <p>Celera's birth shattered the complacency of the public scientists in the Human Genome Project. Every major centre, including the Sanger, went on a sequencing machine-buying race from what is still the leading manufacturer, Perkin Elmer. The HGP rapidly revised its target completion date from 2010 to 2005, to 2003 and finally to the publication of a \"draft\" sequence this summer. No one wants to come second in the race for the code.</p> <p>Very quickly, the contest descended into a propaganda war, with each side questioning the other's scientific credibility, its motives, personalities and, crucially, who was going to get the credit. Sulston complains about Celera's \"one-way trap door\" that allows it to use the two billion bases in the public data, give nothing in return, but then claim credit for sequencing the entire genome. \"They hoover up all the public data, add a bit of their own and sell it as a packaged product,\" says Sulston.</p> <p>Venter, in turn, has accused the Wellcome Trust of orchestrating a \"dirty tricks\" campaign. On February 29, 2000, after a sustained effort to hype up their share price, Celera raised almost $1 billion from the stock market by issuing another 3.8 million shares, at $225 a share. Two weeks later, on March 14, President Clinton and prime minister Tony Blair announced in a rare joint statement that they would like to see \"unencumbered access\" to the human genome.</p> <p>Celera immediately saw the hidden hand of the Wellcome Trust behind the statement. Although neither Clinton or Blair said anything new, Celera's shareholders panicked - believing the ongoing patent bonanza was under attack. Celera's share price dropped through the floor. The stock is now trading at $64. And to add to the company's woes, a New York law firm has just launched a class action on behalf of disgruntled investors, claiming the company suppressed vital details - later leaked by the Wellcome Trust - of Celera's secret talks with the public HGP.</p> <p>In many ways, the differing techniques of both sides are complementary. Combining both the public gene-mapping and Celera's shotgun data would produce a far more accurate and comprehensive data set. Teams from Celera and the HGP met near Washington in December for secret talks to hammer out details of proposed collaboration. But instead of peace and co-operation, the meeting ended in a blazing argument. The irresolvable issue was the public release of the data. Celera wanted some form of exclusive deal so as to be able to sell the genome sequence to their paying customers before handing it over to the public. There were conditions, restrictions and the sequence would only be available from Celera's website. It was hardly surprising. Celera is a private company that wants to make profits. Whatever Venter might say in public about free data release, his business partner's fine print in private seems to undermine his rhetoric; Celera is not going to give its crown jewels away.</p> <p>For the Wellcome Trust, the human genome was not for sale. \"While establishing a monopoly on commercial uses of the human genome sequence may be in Celera's business interests, it is not in the best interests of science or the general public,\" it concluded in a joint HGP letter that was leaked on March 6.</p> <p>Prospects of future collaboration now seem slim. \"Tell the Wellcome Trust they missed their timing. They could have cost us a billion dollars. We have a billion dollars in the bank to do the next stage. We are in phenomenal shape,\" boasts Venter.</p> <p>Ironically, the race for code has become an all too human story of rivalry, emotion and fear. But that is hardly surprising. The human genome is far too important to end up as just another bit of academia. It is an issue of fundamental importance, fundamental philosophy. Should our genetic code end up as the property of a private American corporation? Are our genes the property of who claims them first? Our instinctive answer is no. But in the real world, companies who invest in genomics, drugs, genetic tests, will only do so if their investments are protected. Nothing is free. Finding the right boundary between our common genetic heritage and proprietary ownership of bits of our genes is one of the many challenges that lie ahead.</p> <p>Soon, possibly within the next two weeks, either Craig Venter or John Sulston will be able to hold a DVD disc containing the human book of life, our genome, in his hand. Either way, it will be a stunning achievement. It will not be the end of the race for the code. Decoding the genome, locating genes, creating new drugs, interpreting the genomic babble of our ancestry, is the work of decades. But it will mark a line. It will be a break point, a new beginning in our human story.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street last night tried to draw a line under Tony Blair's blackest day urging the party not to turn in on itself in a \"blame game\" as accusations flew after Labour's biggest electoral setback for three years. The prime minister's office made clear it did not want more blood on the carpet. \"That would be utterly pointless. It wasn't the greatest story but you learn from it and move on,\" said a senior official. \"If there was one strategic error it was not thinking it through early on.\" The acknowledgement by Downing Street that it and the Labour hierarchy should have drawn up plans sooner to stop Ken Livingstone came as even the PM was privately blamed for the London mayor fiasco. \"The truth is you have got to blame Blair to some extent,\" said a party source. \"If he has not taken leadership you know that this is his responsibility, and if he has taken leadership of it then it's his responsibility.\" Westminster colleagues of Frank Dobson fear he will explode if any attempt is made to pin the blame on him. During his disastrous campaign, the former health secretary denounced the party hierarchy as \"prats\" and \"stupid\" over their handling of his battle with Mr Livingstone. A close associate of Mr Dobson yesterday predicted he would remain loyal unless backed into a corner. \"Frank's problem is that he won't tell a lie,\" he warned. Other names in the frame include Margaret McDonagh, Sally Morgan, Jonathan Powell, Trevor Phillips, Jim Fitzpatrick and Jeremy Fraser. Ms McDonagh, 38, Labour's general secretary for two years, has been the victim of a whispering campaign claiming she failed to alert No 10 of the dangers of a Livingstone challenge. She attempted to rally Millbank's demoralised troops yesterday, urging them to avoid getting sucked into the blame game and instead head off for Watford to canvass in a weekend poll. \"Sister McDonagh doesn't act without consulting Brother Blair. It would be be daft to blame Millbank or vice versa,\" said an aide. Others blame the London defeat on Ms Morgan, No 10's political secretary who used to enjoy a Ms Fixit image. She is accused of not concentrating the premier's mind much earlier. \"She'll want to make sure her hands are clean,\"said a critic. Ms McDonagh and Ms Morgan, 40, used to be bitter enemies though they get on better now, with another Labour source predicting they would \"sink or swim\" together. Mr Dobson believes Mr Powell, Mr Blair's chief of staff, undermined his campaign by championing Mo Mowlam as an alternative candidate. Trevor Phillips, Mr Dobson's running mate who would have been deputy mayor, did not perform as well as expected. \"Proved not to be a very good campaigner,\" was one verdict. London MP Jim Fitzpatrick is expected to quit as chairman of the London Labour party after he was one of several leading lights who advised the leadership that Mr Livingstone would \"bottle\" going alone if defeated in the electoral college. And Jeremy Fraser, Mr Dobson's campaign manager, was unable to overcome formidable hurdles. Labour's national executive and London party will rake over the coals while the executive will also review local results and the Romsey lost deposit. Houghton and Washington East MP Fraser Kemp, a former Labour campaigns co-ordinator, cautioned: \"We have to listen but there's no need to panic. We're still on course to win the next election.\" Strategists including pollster Philip Gould will also study data to discover why so many Labour supporters stayed at home across the country and why others voted for Mr Livingstone. Old loyalties of class and tribe have been crumbling for years but collapsed in London on Thursday. Early fatal errors of not picking Labour's champion sooner to flush out Mr Livingstone's determination to run were compounded by Mr Dobson's and No 10's dithering. At first Mr Blair batted for Mr Dobson, then realised he was making the \"Blair's poodle\" charge worse. \"By the time Frank had won the nomination it was already a pyrrhic victory,\" said an official. Mr Dobson was suddenly found to be an awkward if sincere public speaker, instinctively defensive, chippy when attacked. Mr Dobson's obsession to keep his family life private cost him. He is a cultured man with a keen interests in the arts, theatre, film and books, but he would never be filmed in a gallery. Among the heroes of the doomed Dobson campaign were a number of London Labour MPs who twisted arms and bashed the phone to help rescue him, notably Tessa Jowell, the Blairite employment minister and an old Camden council ally. Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the loyalist Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said: \"The big danger is that the Labour party turns in on itself and indulges in a futile bout of blood-letting in a search for a scapegoat. \"The main lesson of the 1980s was that an inward looking Labour party does not win elections.

Although Tory officials deny there was any such split between the candidate and his party, voters were hard-pressed to spot anyone on his team sporting a blue rosette, and there was no mention of the party in his election posters or on his website.</p> <p>Exploiting the growing rift between Labour and Mr Livingstone, Mr Norris touched all the right liberal buttons to manoeuvre himself into the extraordinary position of being the \"least worst option\" for many Labour and Liberal Democrat voters eager to punish the Labour leadership for rigging the ballot but fearful of a return to the worst excesses of the GLC.</p> <p>As an MP, Mr Norris supported the death penalty, the poll tax and student loans, and described commuters as \"dreadful human beings\". Mr Norris the mayoral candidate was a champion of civil liberties, supporting gay rights and calling for the repeal of section 28, taking a strong anti-racism and anti-sexism stance, and being both anti-hunting and pro-freedom of information.</p> <p>His colourful personal life, however, was always a factor and even threatened to derail his attempts to take on the party nomination after Lord Archer quit the race in disgrace last November, when party members complained about his infidelities.</p> <p>Yet Mr Norris's ability to be all things to all men (and, as the tabloids had graphically pointed out, quite a lot of women too) was also apparent as the charming self-made millionaire succeeded in being both the lovable rogue and maverick not afraid of \"ruffling feathers\" while, at the same time, confessing to be an \"appalling anorak who happens to know more about London's bus and tube network than almost anyone else alive\".</p> <p>Despite his repeated refusal, during the bruising battles between the left, to \"intrude on private grief\", it was ultimately Mr Norris who provided the greatest threat to Ken Livingstone - and the greatest hu miliation for Frank Dobson.</p> <p>Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrat - and sole female - candidate, was widely regarded as having run a solid campaign despite having no background in politics.</p> <p>A keen advocate of devolution and regional government, she based her campaign on her pledge to walk each of London's 150 high streets before polling day, hearing the views of voters.</p> <p>Yet while pundits repeatedly praised her financial and busi ness expertise, her managerial competence and her transport policies, her brand of \"grown-up\" politics was not enough to tip the balance for many voters wavering in the run-up to polling day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Steve Norris was, according to Ken Livingstone, \"the only Tory candidate that we feared having to fight\". As the man who gave Mr Livingstone a far closer race than anyone could have expected, Mr Norris's respectable second place at the end of the bruising mayoral race proved that the eventual victor's fears had been well founded. But Mr Norris was far from being an ordinary Tory candidate, choosing to run his campaign from a basement office in Victoria rather than from Conservative central office, and with not a single blue rosette or Tory frontbencher in sight. Mr Norris, who has been privately exasperated by the Tory leadership's lurch to the right, chose his words carefully after the results were formally announced at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in Westminster yesterday, but his message was clear. He had done so well, he explained, because he had campaigned \"on the basis of openness, inclusivity, fairness and tolerance, of reaching out to every Londoner\". This tactic was perhaps the crucial factor in attracting many Londoners who have never before voted Tory to choose to mark their cross by his name on polling day. \"I am proud of the fact that many people, indeed many thousands of people, who have never voted Conservative before actually voted for me in this election,\" Mr Norris said. His had been, he said, a \"pretty terrific performance\" and \"certainly one that confounded all the pollsters, certainly one that enabled me to say that I had scored more votes that the next two candidates put together, to run Ken into a second ballot and in the end to come as close as any of us would have dared hope at the outset of this campaign\". For the former Tory transport minister, it has been a remarkable journey from the embarrassing 1993 tabloid headlines about \"Shagger\" Norris's five mistresses to his return to the spotlight and reinvention as a serious politician. A skilled political operator, he wisely realised that his only chance of victory over the independent Mr Livingstone in a Labour-voting city lay in attracting disaffected voters from other parties. This meant distancing himself from the Conservative party. Although Tory officials deny there was any such split between the candidate and his party, voters were hard-pressed to spot anyone on his team sporting a blue rosette, and there was no mention of the party in his election posters or on his website. Exploiting the growing rift between Labour and Mr Livingstone, Mr Norris touched all the right liberal buttons to manoeuvre himself into the extraordinary position of being the \"least worst option\" for many Labour and Liberal Democrat voters eager to punish the Labour leadership for rigging the ballot but fearful of a return to the worst excesses of the GLC. As an MP, Mr Norris supported the death penalty, the poll tax and student loans, and described commuters as \"dreadful human beings\". Mr Norris the mayoral candidate was a champion of civil liberties, supporting gay rights and calling for the repeal of section 28, taking a strong anti-racism and anti-sexism stance, and being both anti-hunting and pro-freedom of information. His colourful personal life, however, was always a factor and even threatened to derail his attempts to take on the party nomination after Lord Archer quit the race in disgrace last November, when party members complained about his infidelities. Yet Mr Norris's ability to be all things to all men (and, as the tabloids had graphically pointed out, quite a lot of women too) was also apparent as the charming self-made millionaire succeeded in being both the lovable rogue and maverick not afraid of \"ruffling feathers\" while, at the same time, confessing to be an \"appalling anorak who happens to know more about London's bus and tube network than almost anyone else alive\". Despite his repeated refusal, during the bruising battles between the left, to \"intrude on private grief\", it was ultimately Mr Norris who provided the greatest threat to Ken Livingstone - and the greatest hu miliation for Frank Dobson. Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrat - and sole female - candidate, was widely regarded as having run a solid campaign despite having no background in politics. A keen advocate of devolution and regional government, she based her campaign on her pledge to walk each of London's 150 high streets before polling day, hearing the views of voters. Yet while pundits repeatedly praised her financial and busi ness expertise, her managerial competence and her transport policies, her brand of \"grown-up\" politics was not enough to tip the balance for many voters wavering in the run-up to polling day.",

He could reflect that, while his hard talk on asylum seekers and vigilante farmers played well with the core Tory vote - which punched above its weight to win low-turnout local elections - that same rhetoric turned off enough voters to lose in a high-turnout contest like Romsey.

He would, he promised, be presiding over a \"broad administration\" for the capital's new city hall. Livingstone's first move will be to offer the hand of cooperation to the prime minister who worked so hard and at such cost to prevent his election, having insisted that while elections highlighted political divisions, his aim would now be to unite Londoners and help heal the rift in Labour which was opened by the mayoral selection. Quoting Winston Churchill's homily in favour of magnanimity in victory yesterday at his new Whitehall headquarters, the mayor was at pains to emphasise his consensual approach and his determination that the Greater London assembly dispense with the \"sterile politics\" of Westminster party caucusing. Inclusivity will be the theme of his first days in office. The man who once terrorised the suburbs as Red Ken might have just secured the largest ever electoral victory by a candidate to Labour's left, but the former Greater London council leader has no intention of scaring off elements of the coalition he has assembled for his electoral comeback. While New Labour and Tory politicians have vied with each other to brand him as a threat to jobs and public order, the Brent East MP has been wooing London business organisations and the police in a series of private meetings. Livingstone has, his aides report, developed a \"genuinely high regard\" for the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, and their discussions are said to have been particularly positive. Now he will have to build a working relationship with the 25 newly elected assembly members and the 32 boroughs that will continue to deliver most local services to Londoners. But armed with his new powers of patronage and Tony Blair's edict to Labour GLA members not to seek confrontation with the new mayor - at least this side of the general election - that should not prove to be an insuperable task. The new mayor's first key appointments, starting with a deputy - he has mischievously floated the idea of rotating the job around the main parties in the GLA - are likely to be announced in the next few days, though others will have to wait for more of the \"listening to London\" that Livingstone favoured in the run-up to his decision to stand as an independent. Several of the new mayor's long-established advisers and allies - such as his agent Simon Fletcher, race and policing campaigner Lee Jasper, and Tower Hamlets councillor Kumar Murshid - are expected to get jobs in the new London administration, but most appointees will be less predictable. Among the string of jobs effectively in the mayor's gift are two political advisers, a 10-strong policy unit, a cabinet and most of the members and chairs of the boards due to run transport, the police, fire brigade, culture and economic development when the GLA finally gets off the ground on July 3. The new mayor's team has already targeted a group of Labour GLA members regarded as most amenable to forming alliances with his embryonic London administration. But for all Livingstone's grand declarations for cross-party cooperation, there are some bottom-line issues his closest advisers insist are not negotiable, foremost of which is the mayor's opposition to the partial sell-off of the London Underground. Speculation that the newly crowned independent is planning a graceful climbdown on the issue is wrong, they say, despite the fact that the government is not intending to hand over control of the tube until its public-private partnership (PPP) is locked into place. \"We have no technical powers to block them,\" one aide comments, \"but Ken regards this election as having been a referendum on the tube privatisation issue and we aren't looking for face-savers - we're looking to stop the PPP.\" That tallies with what Livingstone himself said in March, when he pledged: \"I'll use all my resources, everything I can mobilise, including a court challenge, if the government doesn't drop their proposal to break up the tube and go for partial privatisation.\" At his inaugural press conference yesterday, he repeated the warning, adding that just as he wanted to cooperate with Downing Street, the government \"should also cooperate with London\" by \"respecting the views of Londoners\" and accepting that an overwhelming majority had voted for candidates opposed to its part-privatisation plans. In the longer term, Livingstone has said he will freeze tube and bus fares for four years, introduce a central London congestion charge and press for more government investment in London's transport system with the aim of cutting the capital's traffic overload by 15% by 2010. Promising the \"most open, accessible and inclusive style of government ever seen in the UK\", the new mayor plans to pick up where the GLC left off with equal opportunities policies, an increase of police numbers by 2,000, sponsorship of ambitious arts, sports and environmental programmes, and cajoling of money out of Whitehall for more low-cost homes and better health and education services. At his victory party on Thursday night, Livingstone signalled that the greening of London would be a dominant theme of his administration. But the mayor and GLA's powers are modest and tightly constrained by government. Livingstone's effectiveness will largely depend on how effectively he uses his electoral mandate and platform to exert political pressure on government, businesses and public service providers. He was already up and running yesterday, pressing for government intervention to ensure the survival of Ford's Dagenham plant in Essex and blaming the high value of the pound for the threat to its future. Having declared his election victory \"independence day\" for London, an early test of such tactics will come with the announcement of the government's new regional spending plans in the next few weeks. Livingstone will be demanding that central government stop \"kicking London\" and his campaign for more money for the capital is likely to be relentless.",

Darren Johnson, who stood for mayor, is being tipped as a future deputy to Ken Livingstone after the Greens won 11% of the votes for the London-wide assembly. The party, which polled a high of 16% in the North-East constituency, also won assembly places for Victor Anderson and Jenny Jones. Mr Johnson, 33, a PhD stu dent, said: \"It's a really historic day for the Green party and a historic day for London.\" He pledged that the Green group would \"want to get stuck into the decision-making process\", adding: \"We aren't just going to be shouting from the sidelines.\" In his mayoral manifesto, Mr Johnson proposed a 20mph speed limit across London and a daily \u00a310 charge on motorists to drive into town. The Greens' success in London means that the party now has six prominent elected representatives in Britain, including two MEPs and a member of the Scottish parliament. The veteran campaigner Jean Lambert, an MEP, said the Greens were now a serious political movement in Britain. \"We are catching up with our sister parties elsewhere in Europe,\" she said. The proportional voting system, coupled with Labour's poor performance, has ensured that no party has a majority, giving the Greens a strong voice in the assembly.

Mr Blair was expected to remain for an unscheduled second night. The British and Irish governments, learning from previous experience, were downplaying expectations of progress. But there were increasing hopes of a breakthrough, and President Clinton was consulted. Mr Blair's faith in devolution remained clear, despite his disappointment yesterday at Frank Dobson's humiliating defeat in the race for London mayor. He said he remained committed to the agreement. Niall O'Dowd, publisher of the Irish Voice, a pro-republican US newspaper, fanned optimism when he said in a radio interview he believed the IRA was poised to make a new offer.

Another important element was the government's failure so far to publish a policing bill, paving the way for the Patten reforms of the RUC. It had been expected this week. That has lead to speculation that David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, would win a respite for the RUC name, alongside the new description, the Policing Service of Northern Ireland, to persuade his sceptical party. The blueprint leading to re-formation of the institutions would include a statement from the two governments, and Ulster Unionist acceptance to rejoin the executive with Sinn Fein before the IRA begins to decommission its weapons. The most crucial element is an IRA statement. Mr Blair would put pressure on Mr Trimble if the IRA fleshed out its February 11 initiative to put weapons beyond use. He is ready to alter the remit of General John de Chastelain's decommissioning body to widen the definition away from destruction.",

      "bodyText": "Senior Labour backbenchers and middle ranking ministers yesterday sounded new warnings about the party losing its grip in traditional heartlands after sweeping Liberal Democrat and Tory local election gains in parts of England. With Labour losing over 560 seats outside London along with 15 councils - almost twice as many as senior ministers were predicting earlier this week - Tony Blair attempted to play down the significance of almost 600 new Conservative councillors and Tory control in 16 more town halls. While losing Torbay to the Tories, Liberal Democrats consolidated their hold on Liverpool and Sheffield, while taking Oldham from Labour and helping to remove Labour from overall control in Hartlepool, Peter Mandelson's constituency, after 21 years. But the prime minister's claim that voters accepted the government was committed to a \"long-term programme of change\" - with the implication they were prepared to be patient while reforms, such as health and education, filtered through - was challenged by senior MPs, and privately some ministers, after Labour's worst elections defeat in eight years. Viewing the opposition advancing from the south coast to the West Midlands, Pennine towns in Lancashire and Yorkshire and other northern citadels, backbenchers said the Labour losses should be viewed as a \"wake up call\" to the government. With turnout around 30% overall, they warned that disaffected supporters were now handing seats to the opposition on a plate by refusing to vote. \"We have to get across more effectively what the government has achieved,\" said Sir Jeremy Beecham, Labour chairman of the Local Government Association. Two former ministers went further by warning that the \"armchair rebellion\" could threaten key seats at next year's general election unless monumental efforts were made to \"re-connect\" with traditional areas. \"There's a lot of unease out there,\" said Peter Kilfoyle, MP for Liverpool Walton, who resigned as a junior defence minister earlier this year. \"The message for the leadership is, 'don't take your core vote for granted'. Let's hope this is a short, sharp shock which will renew the leadership's perception of what needs to be done.\" Claiming the result was \"not good but not catastrophic\", Doug Henderson, another former defence minister and MP for Newcastle North, said voters in traditional areas had yet to see their high expectations of the government being met. \"A lot of people need a lot of convincing before the general election and the battleground between now and then is persuading core supporters to come out and vote,\" he said. A normally loyal middle-ranking minister joined colleagues in warning that continued uncertainties surrounding manufacturing, caused by the high pound and the government's \"over-emphasis\" on the south east, were driving voters away. Such an argument was reinforced by opposition advances in Birmingham, where Labour's 36-seat majority was cut to 15, partly because of the \"Longbridge factor\" as well as the intervention of a Kashmiri freedom party, which split the Labour vote. Sir Richard Knowles, the veteran former council leader, lost the seat he has held for 24 years. He said fears for the future of Rover had been a \"big problem on the doorstep\". William Hague hailed a \"sensational\" Tory advance, which saw his party force the Liberal Democrats out of Torbay and Eastbourne, while helping to remove Labour from either control, or as the outright majority party, in Plymouth, Portsmouth, Southampton, and elsewhere on the south coast where the Tory strategy of playing the asylum card clearly hit home. Conservatives also gained control of councils from Great Yarmouth to Rossendale, in the north west, while re-taking town halls in their old Surrey heartlands, as well as making steady progress in the West Midlands. They took Worcester from Labour after 20 years, regained overall control of Solihull and Stratford upon Avon, while in Walsall Labour lost overall control.",

In Gateshead, where overall turnout was 29.6%, two wards chosen to test entirely postal elections - with freepost - saw the figure shoot from 30.1% last year to 62.2% and from 19.5% to 46.3%.</p> <p>\"The convenience seems to have done the trick,\" said Ian Clarkin of Gateshead council, \"but we also had some 800 people handing in their postal envelopes at the library and civic centre on Thursday.\"</p> <p>Exclusively postal voting also lifted the turnout in Doncaster where Conisbrough ward piloted the experiment and saw turnout jump to 39.8% from 16.1% in an autumn byelection and 24.4% last May.</p> <p>The results, which are being sent to the Home Office for monitoring and a possible roll-out of reforms nationally next year, applied in politically unexciting areas as well as marginal wards where voters had an obvious chance to make a difference.

      "bodyText": "Overall voter apathy in Thursday's polls obscured a run of successes for voting experiments by local councils that made the elections the most innovative since 18-year-olds were given the vote in 1969. Across the country, wards with pilot schemes for electronic voting, mobile polling stations and up to a week of extra voting days bucked the generally gloomy trend. Allowing all electors to have a postal vote proved the most effective of the changes, which are being encouraged by the government under reforming sections of the Representation of the People Act 2000 that received royal assent in March. In Gateshead, where overall turnout was 29.6%, two wards chosen to test entirely postal elections - with freepost - saw the figure shoot from 30.1% last year to 62.2% and from 19.5% to 46.3%. \"The convenience seems to have done the trick,\" said Ian Clarkin of Gateshead council, \"but we also had some 800 people handing in their postal envelopes at the library and civic centre on Thursday.\" Exclusively postal voting also lifted the turnout in Doncaster where Conisbrough ward piloted the experiment and saw turnout jump to 39.8% from 16.1% in an autumn byelection and 24.4% last May. The results, which are being sent to the Home Office for monitoring and a possible roll-out of reforms nationally next year, applied in politically unexciting areas as well as marginal wards where voters had an obvious chance to make a difference. The larger of the two increases in Gateshead was in inner-city Bensham, a Labour stronghold with scant prospect of change. The charms of changing the voting system itself were less evident, with London's new preferential system scoring only 35% overall. But taking the polling station to the people, via mobile ballot boxes, proved generally successful. Norwich had 90 requests for home visits, in spite of the requirement of a GP's signature, and a tour of sheltered housing in Watford by a \"voting van\" achieved a 44% poll of elderly residents. The main glitches hit electronic voting, with London's long delays matched at Stratford-on-Avon. But in Bury, the council is to extend a touch-screen voting system after a pilot in Besses ward attracted an unusually high number of older voters and a result within 50 minutes of close of poll. Supermarket polling, believed to be in tune with an increasingly \"shop-around\" attitude to candidates by many voters, was also brisk in Watford, where customers at Asda had a polling station open from last Friday to Sunday. Final results of the experiment in the borough, which has more pilots than anywhere else, will not be known until Monday, as voting continues throughout this weekend. The complicated electoral system in London confounded tens of thousands of voters. Under the new system, voters had a first and second choice for mayor. In the assembly election Londoners voted for a constituency member, elected on a first-past-the-post basis, and for a London-wide list of members elected by PR. Around 2% of mayoral ballot papers were rejected. In the City and East constituency, 8,050 ballot papers were rejected out of a total of 117,653 for the London-wide list in the assembly election.",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, yesterday hailed his party's shock by-election victory in Romsey as a \"triumph for the politics of hope over the politics of fear\" and said the result proved that William Hague's shift to the right could not succeed at a general election. Congratulating Sandra Gidley, victor in the formerly true blue Hampshire seat, a jubilant Mr Kennedy sought to portray the win as a launchpad for his party's general election campaign and a highly damaging blow to the Conservatives, who lost the poll on a 12.6% swing. The Liberal Democrats had succeeded in wooing not only disillusioned Labour supporters and tactical voters, but also former Conservative voters who were \"repelled\" by William Hague's Tory party, Mr Kennedy said. After a frenetic Lib Dem campaign that outshone a somewhat complacent Conservative effort - despite three visits to the constituency from Mr Hague - Mrs Gidley, a pharmacist, defeated the Tory farmer Tim Palmer by a 3,311 majority and saw Labour's Andrew Howard lose his deposit. The byelection followed the death of the Tory MP Michael Colvin in a fire at his home in February. After a long night that saw cautious Tory hopes turn to gloom during an exceptionally sluggish count, the Lib Dems partied till dawn in Romsey's balloon-decked town hall before Mr Kennedy's victory walkabout and a photocall beneath a statue of the Liberal prime minister and Romsey resident Lord Palmerston. Tory banners still hung above the market square, but Mr Palmer, a personable but uninspiring old Etonian whose Dorset residency counted against him in the poll, was nowhere to be found. Lib Dem strategists, who took the decision to \"throw the kitchen sink\" at the campaign in the hope of wrongfooting the Tories, point to the verdict as vindication of their argument that Mr Hague's recent hardline pronouncements on asylum and law and order can do no more than guarantee the hardcore Conservative vote. Lord Razzall, chairman of the Lib Dem campaigns committee, said yesterday: \"Hague is polarising the country between the 30% who buy those argu ments and 30% who find them repellent. Romsey shows that tactic only works with elections with a small turnout of around 30% or less, such as the local or European elections.\" The Hampshire seat, with a turnout of 55%, was a far closer guide to the general election result than the local elections, he said. \"There was a big Tory stay-at-home factor here, as well as those that came over to us. Hague is marching his party to electoral oblivion if he continues down this road.\" Mr Kennedy said the result had left Mr Hague's election strategy in tatters. His party's win was \"a triumph for the politics of hope over the politics of fear, for the politics of wanting to unite communities\". The Lib Dem leader, who succeeded Paddy Ashdown last August, can feel personally strengthened as a result of the win after an occasionally shaky first nine months.

Low turnout and mid-term disillusionment with government were certainly factors in the defeat but, in my view, the problems run deeper. For years the Labour-controlled council highlighted and attacked the unfairness of the Tory government's allocation of funding to councils. We consistently had to cut services whilst increasing the council tax well beyond the rate of inflation. We believed a Labour government would bring some equity, but those hopes have not yet been realised.</p> <p>Instead, the quality of the local environment has continued to deteriorate and crumble. Gullies and drains are blocked; roads full of pot-holes; footpaths positively dangerous; grass cut irregularly; litter not swept; and so on. There has been little or nothing to tell the voters about what a Labour-controlled council has achieved in improving basic services. All the local problems stem from a long-term lack of resources and government's continuing failure to address funding inequality between councils.</p> <p>This is a \"heartland\" issue for Labour; the role of councils in helping deliver a feel-good factor has been seriously underestimated. Labour party activists like myself are finding little to take comfort from nationally and nothing to compensate locally. Not only is the message being delivered to the electorate being doubted, I doubt if I want to deliver it.</p> <p><b>Steve Freeborn</b><br>Ripley, Derbys<br>sdf@globalnet.co.uk</p> <p>\u0095 May 4, 2000 will be remembered as the day Labour's core working-class voters finally rejected the \"New\" Labour leadership's lurch to the right. For many loyal Labour supporters, Tony Blair, Jack Straw et al are indistinguishable from previous Tory governments. Unless Labour adopts a policy of a living pension for the retired, a healthy NHS, truly comprehensive and properly funded schools that even a prime minister would be happy to send his children to and takes back into public ownership the Tory privatised public utilities, public transport for a start, then the prospects for the next general election do not look good.</p> <p><b>Colin Penfold</b><br>Llanbrynmair, Powys</p> <p>\u0095 Interesting, isn't it, that in his letter to London voters Tony Blair distinguishes between Labour supporters and \"...everyone who believes in what I am trying to achieve for our country...\"</p> <p><b>Russell Levy</b><br>London<br>Russ@leighday.co.uk</p> <p>\u0095 In Hastings we still have a Labour-controlled council. They have been in control for about three years and have made a big difference, for the better, to the running of the town. The Tories made four gains, one from Labour and three from the Lib Dems. Two of those gains were in seats that have a number of asylum seekers and the race card, so blatantly played at national level, has also been used here. So much so that the National Front are now wanting to march through our town. Before the media goes overboard and thinks that the Tory party are back, just remember they can only be elected by pandering to the right-wing racist and xenophobic element in society.</p> <p><b>Trevor May</b><br>Hastings, E Sussex</p> <p>\u0095 The new \"Labour\" New Zealand government (The Future is Kiwi, May 4) is a coalition government with the Greens, made possible by proportional representation. Many of the policies Jonathan Freedland cites with such enthusiasm are Green initiated.</p> <p><b>Lesley Greene</b><br>Stroud, Glos<br>evans.greene@zetnet.co.uk</p> <p>The axiom on which New Labour is built is that it is impossible for the party to win an election except by occupying a centrist position. Tony Blair's grip on the party is wholly dependent on its members believing this, but the result of the mayoral contest shows it is false. Uniquely, the electorate was given the opportunity to choose between New and Old Labour, having experienced them both. If Ken Livingstone's GLC was so bad, why did so many people vote for him? Perhaps the Labour party, at grassroots and parliamentary levels, will now realise its timidity will not do after all lead to electoral success.</p> <p><b>Adam Riege</b><br>University of Glasgow</p> <p>\u0095 Tony Blair places great importance on the support of the Sun, which urged its readers to vote for anyone but Ken. His victory in the face of hostility from all the tabloids shows that Blair should stop grovelling to Murdoch &amp; co and get on with what he believes to be right.</p> <p><b>Joe Devas</b><br>London</p> <p>\u0095 A few months ago Ken Livingstone appealed for votes with heartfelt expressions of love and loyalty towards the Labour party. Now Norris, Kramer and Dobson will all be invited to serve under the all-conquering Ken, who now seems, like the Queen Mum, to be above mere politics. Many on the left have enjoyed the prospect of a defeat for the Millbank Tendency.

There has been little or nothing to tell the voters about what a Labour-controlled council has achieved in improving basic services. All the local problems stem from a long-term lack of resources and government's continuing failure to address funding inequality between councils. This is a \"heartland\" issue for Labour; the role of councils in helping deliver a feel-good factor has been seriously underestimated. Labour party activists like myself are finding little to take comfort from nationally and nothing to compensate locally. Not only is the message being delivered to the electorate being doubted, I doubt if I want to deliver it. Steve Freeborn Ripley, Derbys sdf@globalnet.co.uk \u0095 May 4, 2000 will be remembered as the day Labour's core working-class voters finally rejected the \"New\" Labour leadership's lurch to the right. For many loyal Labour supporters, Tony Blair, Jack Straw et al are indistinguishable from previous Tory governments. Unless Labour adopts a policy of a living pension for the retired, a healthy NHS, truly comprehensive and properly funded schools that even a prime minister would be happy to send his children to and takes back into public ownership the Tory privatised public utilities, public transport for a start, then the prospects for the next general election do not look good. Colin Penfold Llanbrynmair, Powys \u0095 Interesting, isn't it, that in his letter to London voters Tony Blair distinguishes between Labour supporters and \"...everyone who believes in what I am trying to achieve for our country...\" Russell Levy London Russ@leighday.co.uk \u0095 In Hastings we still have a Labour-controlled council. They have been in control for about three years and have made a big difference, for the better, to the running of the town. The Tories made four gains, one from Labour and three from the Lib Dems. Two of those gains were in seats that have a number of asylum seekers and the race card, so blatantly played at national level, has also been used here. So much so that the National Front are now wanting to march through our town. Before the media goes overboard and thinks that the Tory party are back, just remember they can only be elected by pandering to the right-wing racist and xenophobic element in society. Trevor May Hastings, E Sussex \u0095 The new \"Labour\" New Zealand government (The Future is Kiwi, May 4) is a coalition government with the Greens, made possible by proportional representation. Many of the policies Jonathan Freedland cites with such enthusiasm are Green initiated. Lesley Greene Stroud, Glos evans.greene@zetnet.co.uk The axiom on which New Labour is built is that it is impossible for the party to win an election except by occupying a centrist position. Tony Blair's grip on the party is wholly dependent on its members believing this, but the result of the mayoral contest shows it is false. Uniquely, the electorate was given the opportunity to choose between New and Old Labour, having experienced them both. If Ken Livingstone's GLC was so bad, why did so many people vote for him? Perhaps the Labour party, at grassroots and parliamentary levels, will now realise its timidity will not do after all lead to electoral success. Adam Riege University of Glasgow \u0095 Tony Blair places great importance on the support of the Sun, which urged its readers to vote for anyone but Ken. His victory in the face of hostility from all the tabloids shows that Blair should stop grovelling to Murdoch &amp; co and get on with what he believes to be right. Joe Devas London \u0095 A few months ago Ken Livingstone appealed for votes with heartfelt expressions of love and loyalty towards the Labour party. Now Norris, Kramer and Dobson will all be invited to serve under the all-conquering Ken, who now seems, like the Queen Mum, to be above mere politics. Many on the left have enjoyed the prospect of a defeat for the Millbank Tendency. How do they feel now Ken is espousing the most subversive tenet of the reactionary right, that government is about management and not a matter of political convictions? Paul Taylor London",

Two days before Mr Putin is formally sworn in as president and eight months after he launched the war that put him in the Kremlin, Sergei Ivanov, a key aide to Mr Putin, announced that the new president would shortly issue a decree establishing direct federal rule over Chechnya.

Direct Kremlin rule would be for \"a historically brief period, possibly two to three years\", Mr Ivanov said. War-ravaged Chechnya was in no state to hold new presidential elections, he said. Mr Putin's move came as General Vladimir Shamanov, one of the officers running the Russian campaign in Chechnya, said a division of Russian troops would be permanently deployed in Chechnya from next month. The occupation force is to garrison Chechnya while the new Putin government works out what it intends to do with the unruly republic. Although the war has disappeared from the headlines and is concentrated on a relatively small area of mountainous southern Chechnya, the separatist guerrillas remain highly active and are exacting a heavy toll on the Russians who, according to official figures, are losing more than 30 men every week. Under the peace deal that ended the 1994-96 Chechen war, Chechnya acquired de facto independence although debate on its status was de ferred. That agreement has been shredded.

      "bodyText": "The performance was in the best traditions of music hall, with bawdy humour, risque language and a curtain-raising finale. The audience cheered and clapped as a furious wife took centre stage and berated her husband in suitably earthy language for having an affair. Minutes later the police rushed in and dragged the wife away kicking and screaming to wild laughter and applause. So delighted were the audience with the high drama that they failed to realise that the appearance of the actress Margaret Le Foe at the Players' Theatre in London's West End was not in the script but the real, unbridled fury of a woman scorned. Mrs Le Foe, not listed in the show's dramatis personae of Ridgeway's Late Joys, had seized her chance during Tuesday night's performance to accuse her director husband, Daniel Le Foe, of having an affair with the actress Maria St Clare. Last night Mrs Le Foe, who is in her 60s and has been married for 41 years, said she was delighted that her impromptu appearance had made the audience sit up. \"The police dragged me off the stage in my Yves St Laurent suit, down two flights of stairs, past the dressing rooms, and threw me out into the street,\" she said from the Westminster home she shares with her husband. \"It was all very dramatic. \"My husband and this woman have behaved disgracefully. He has been deceitful and has been sleeping with this woman for a long time. \"He is behaving like a fool, and I wanted to teach him a lesson.\" After she was led off stage by the police, the theatre manager announced that the final curtain had come down early. Mrs Le Foe, who confirmed she has filed for a judicial separation from her husband, who is in his 70s, said she had been banned from going near the theatre. Sources at the subscription-funded theatre - one of the few remaining homes of proper Victorian-style music hall shows - said that last Sunday Mrs Le Foe came in and spotted her husband with Ms St Clare in the theatre. Enraged, she went over and poured a glass of red wine over her. Afterwards theatre officials wrote to Mrs Le Foe saying her membership had been cancelled and she must not come near the theatre. Last night a member of the cast, who asked not to be named, added: \"I later heard Mr Le Foe dropped his top hat during the row, and Mrs Le Foe stamped on it.\" Yesterday a theatre spokesman said Mr Le Foe's relationship with Ms St Clare was a \"private matter\" for him and his wife but insisted the show would go on.",

But any jubilation in cyberspace at this legal green light for e-commerce greed to resume was surely removed by the devastation caused by the love bug.</p> <p>One of the advantages of the new computerised economy was thought to be that it reduced capitalism's vulnerability to terrorism and theft. Highly visible local branches or corporate headquarters were no longer necessary. If the IRA had frightened you away from Manchester, Belfast or London, it was plausible now to sell into those places from some distant, tranquil building. A corporation could become physically invisible while maintaining a global presence.</p> <p>The use of computer viruses by anarchists, terrorists and pranksters has removed this illusion. The machines which free a chief executive and the staff from physical danger open them to commercial disruption on a scale which no conventional terrorist could ever contemplate: imagine the amount of plastic explosive and planning required to stall a major corporation in all its operations for a day.</p> <p>And - crucially - cyber-terrorists and email guerrillas attract far less censure than the traditional kind. The general problem for anarchists has been that a majority of most civilised populations will balk at attacks on the innocents, no matter what the cause. But residual Luddism - and our accumulated experience of dealing with banks and our employers - means that it is hard not to feel an inner glee when the world's computers crash. Cyber-terrorism is able to present itself as a genuinely victimless crime. That military fantasy of the smart weapon is fulfilled in the e-mail grenade: the infrastructure is dismantled while the people survive. Resistance to these activities would begin only when people ceased to be paid on time or were frequently unable to email their loved ones.</p> <p>Which brings us to the most compelling detail in this stunt: the romantic disguise the virus wore. It is an alluring paradox. If you hate capitalists, tell them you love them: the Judas kiss. What is surprising is that most of us would probably have bet that the general vulnerability was money: that the smart header on an email virus would be \"You've won a million\" or \"This is the number of your Swiss bank account\". But what did for them was the three words from which finally most human troubles follow: I love you.</p> <p>It is true that many (even, hopefully, most) of those who let the virus in would have had someone who loved them. But the protocol of e-mail post boxes (showing you who a message comes from) is such that these people at their keyboards would have known that this declaration of passion came from a total stranger. They wanted there to be someone else. Romantic curiosity proved a bigger threat to capitalism than any bomb or ideology yet invented.</p> <p>Apart from an almost inevitable rush of hacker movies from Hollywood in about 18 months time, there are two likely consequences of this ruinous exploitation of the human desire to be wanted. The kind of money and effort which was spent on the physical protection of corporate premises at the peak of Irish terrorism will now be expended on electronic fences and technological locks. The belief that cyberspace permitted the physically invisible corporation is finished. And, unless effective protection of computer systems can be found, the love bug may have the impact on confidence in the dot.com economy that BSE had on the meat factories.</p> <p>An incidental effect even for those who never use computers may be a change in the nature of junk-mail. Those unsolicited envelopes which declare in golden letters that you have definitely won a major prize or that a car is just waiting for you to drive it away will be replaced by pretend-Valentines, pseudo-bouquets. For a few months, every day will be February 14.</p> <p>For, on Thursday, the oldest human motivation - love - undermined the newest human invention: cyberspace. Anarchists targeted our Achilles' heart.</p> <p>comment@theguardian.com</p>",

One of the advantages of the new computerised economy was thought to be that it reduced capitalism's vulnerability to terrorism and theft. Highly visible local branches or corporate headquarters were no longer necessary. If the IRA had frightened you away from Manchester, Belfast or London, it was plausible now to sell into those places from some distant, tranquil building. A corporation could become physically invisible while maintaining a global presence. The use of computer viruses by anarchists, terrorists and pranksters has removed this illusion. The machines which free a chief executive and the staff from physical danger open them to commercial disruption on a scale which no conventional terrorist could ever contemplate: imagine the amount of plastic explosive and planning required to stall a major corporation in all its operations for a day. And - crucially - cyber-terrorists and email guerrillas attract far less censure than the traditional kind. The general problem for anarchists has been that a majority of most civilised populations will balk at attacks on the innocents, no matter what the cause. But residual Luddism - and our accumulated experience of dealing with banks and our employers - means that it is hard not to feel an inner glee when the world's computers crash. Cyber-terrorism is able to present itself as a genuinely victimless crime. That military fantasy of the smart weapon is fulfilled in the e-mail grenade: the infrastructure is dismantled while the people survive. Resistance to these activities would begin only when people ceased to be paid on time or were frequently unable to email their loved ones. Which brings us to the most compelling detail in this stunt: the romantic disguise the virus wore. It is an alluring paradox. If you hate capitalists, tell them you love them: the Judas kiss. What is surprising is that most of us would probably have bet that the general vulnerability was money: that the smart header on an email virus would be \"You've won a million\" or \"This is the number of your Swiss bank account\". But what did for them was the three words from which finally most human troubles follow: I love you. It is true that many (even, hopefully, most) of those who let the virus in would have had someone who loved them. But the protocol of e-mail post boxes (showing you who a message comes from) is such that these people at their keyboards would have known that this declaration of passion came from a total stranger. They wanted there to be someone else. Romantic curiosity proved a bigger threat to capitalism than any bomb or ideology yet invented. Apart from an almost inevitable rush of hacker movies from Hollywood in about 18 months time, there are two likely consequences of this ruinous exploitation of the human desire to be wanted. The kind of money and effort which was spent on the physical protection of corporate premises at the peak of Irish terrorism will now be expended on electronic fences and technological locks. The belief that cyberspace permitted the physically invisible corporation is finished. And, unless effective protection of computer systems can be found, the love bug may have the impact on confidence in the dot.com economy that BSE had on the meat factories. An incidental effect even for those who never use computers may be a change in the nature of junk-mail. Those unsolicited envelopes which declare in golden letters that you have definitely won a major prize or that a car is just waiting for you to drive it away will be replaced by pretend-Valentines, pseudo-bouquets. For a few months, every day will be February 14. For, on Thursday, the oldest human motivation - love - undermined the newest human invention: cyberspace. Anarchists targeted our Achilles' heart. comment@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The financial ruin of the pro-Nazi author David Irving came closer yesterday when a judge ordered him to pay an interim sum of \u00a3150,000 towards the costs incurred by Penguin Books for his disastrous libel action against charges that he was a Holocaust denier. Last month Mr Justice Charles Gray found in favour of Penguin, which published a book by the American academic Deborah Lipstadt, Denying the Holocaust. The judge found Ms Lipstadt was justified in saying that Irving had falsified history to exonerate Hitler, driven by anti-semitism and his own pro-Nazi views. Yesterday Mr Justice Gray ordered the author to pay \u00a3150,000 by June 17 towards Penguin's estimated \u00a32m legal and research costs. If Irving defaults he could face bankruptcy and the loss of his home. The court heard that Irving had told reporters he had a fighting fund of more than \u00a3300,000 sent to him by supporters around the world. After the hearing Mr Irving refused to say whether he could or would pay, and said the money in the fighting fund was resting in an offshore account. Mr Justice Gray rejected claims by Adrian Davies, representing Irving, that any interim costs order could hamper the author's ability to mount an appeal. Mr Davies had told the court: \"Mr Irving has very little prospect of paying more than relatively little of the costs against him.\" Heather Rogers, appearing for Penguin, had asked for an order worth \u00a3500,000. Mr Justice Gray said Penguin could seek a fresh order for Irving to pay more money if he was denied permission to appeal. After the costs order was granted Kevin Bays, a solicitor for Penguin, said the publisher hoped to recover \u00a31.5m of its legal and research fees. \"On the one hand he says he doesn't have any money, on the other hand he's reported as saying he has 5,000 supporters around the world making donations,\" Mr Bays said. He said the point of getting the order was to save Penguin the time and money of compiling a list of all its costs, by seeing if Irving could first pay a fraction of the final bill. \"By making this order we'll find out if he has lots of supporters and money. If he doesn't pay the money, we'll have to enforce payment. The ultimate is bankruptcy. \"A trustee in bankruptcy would be appointed to assess any assets he's got. That would include his house.\" For yesterday's hearing Irving, who represented himself during the libel trial, hired a solicitor and a barrister. He said the firm of solicitors he had hired, Goldsmiths, had refused to represent him beyond the costs hearing on \"ideological\" grounds. Speaking outside court he claimed this decision would create more anti-semitism. \"They said in their letter this was because one partner had ideological grounds objecting to them acting for me.\" He added: \"They've been pouring slime over me for 30 years.\" Asked to clarify who he meant by \"they\", he said: \"I don't really want to continue this conversation.\"",

On the third day of the trial at the Scottish court in the Netherlands investigators presented vivid evidence of the devastation at Lockerbie and of the fingertip searches to gather vital clues. And they revealed how within days of the atrocity police officers had travelled to Germany and Rome to investigate possible links involving a Palestinian terror group. FBI and CIA agents from America were swiftly on the scene of the disaster. It was later discovered that several US agents were on the doomed flight and sensitive documents had been found in a local forest. Families of the victims and the two accused - Abdel Basset Ali Al Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah - watched in silence as they heard details of how human remains were recovered. The court was shown colour photographs of the wreckage, including part of the plane's fuselage in which 47 bodies were discovered still strapped into their seats. In the operation which followed the crash priority was given to recovering the remains of the 259 passengers and crew, and the 11 Lockerbie residents who were killed. The town and 810 square miles of the surrounding countryside were treated as a murder scene, split into six sectors with officers assigned to sift through the rubble. The crash left body parts in the streets and in the hedgerows of the Borders town. One man's body was found lying on top of a house against a chimney breast in Sherwood Crescent, the worst-affected part of Lockerbie where all the victims on the ground died. It was more than 10 days before all the bodies were recovered . Alexander McLean, 58, then a detective inspector, said one million sewing needles - cargo on the Boeing 747 - hampered the search. \"They landed with the fuselage in the B sector (the Rosebank area of the town) and we found that some officers were getting pricked with needles. \"We had to spread a tarpaulin and move inch by inch.

He had travelled to Rome on two occasions to obtain evidence about a 1972 attack on an El Al flight from Rome to Tel Aviv. In that incident two British girls had been befriended by three men - including a Marwan Kreeshat - and persuaded to take a record player on board the plane. They did not know it contained a bomb.

But there is evidence that many people will go to great lengths to avoid military service, even though the south-east is now largely at peace following the capture of the PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan. A decline in violent activity in the south-east has not been followed by an easing of the strict limits imposed on the expressing of opinions on the Kurdish conflict. The restriction on freedom of expression is one of the issues delaying negotiations on Turkey's possible membership of the European Union. Turkey's most prominent writers have rallied behind Mater and published a joint declaration of solidarity, urging authorities to \"correct this grave mistake\". The signatories include Turkey's two best-known authors, Yasar Kemal and Orhan Pamuk. Casualties of war Soldier 1 'You're psychologically crushed. Helpless. Once you've stepped through the gates there's no turning back. One guy could beat up 400 privates and no one would stop him... 'One friend was killed at night by a single shot. On guard duty we used to smoke under a blanket, so the cigarette light wasn't visible. But he made a mistake. The bullet hit him in the mouth... 'The military is supplied with trucks full of food and it disappears. It's absurd. What are we dying for? The war is fought for money' Soldier 2 'What I had learned as a civilian and what was taught to me in the military were totally different. 'When I went to the east I realised that a lot of the things they attributed to the terrorists were in fact done by soldiers... 'Once we were looking for mines on the road to Guclukonak. One of our vehicles hit a mine and was damaged, but no one was hurt. At that moment an old couple from the village were walking by. One of the soldiers shot the man dead. The old woman was crying... 'If there were any villages left we burned them to the ground. We have even burned down mosques... We force the people out of their homes... pour petrol inside and set them alight. As the village goes up in flames, we watch it from the hills.'",

      "bodyText": "Word quickly reached Mercy Munashe (not her real name) that she should attend a meeting for Zimbabwe's opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. \"I was surprised. We had not been given much notice but there were more than 200 people there,\" she said. \"People were serious and determined. We all know of the violence and the troubles. We are determined to continue but now we must be very cautious.\" After the state-sponsored violence in April in which 14 MDC members or supporters were killed, the party is going to ground. Supporters are being advised to put away their T-shirts, posters and other outward signs of their affiliation. Mrs Munashe, who took MDC stickers off her car, was elected chairman of the MDC branch in her neighbourhood. \"It is an honour for me, but it is also a worry,\" she said. \"If people who support Zanu-PF find out about my activities, then my house might be attacked. I do not want my family to be hurt.\" The MDC leaders will let her know when they want her to help the campaign. \"They said they will ask me to do something that will be discreet, something almost secret, like leaving MDC pamphlets at a bus stop, so that anyone can pick them up. That is safer than standing at the bus stop and handing them out yourself,\" she said. President Robert Mugabe's violent campaign against the MDC has the new party on the run. In the cities people have been beaten to death for wearing an MDC T-shirt. In rural areas supporters have been severely beaten and their huts burned down. In most cases the police have not protected those being assaulted by Zanu-PF members, nor have they made arrests. Privately, top MDC officials concede they do not believe they can win an outright parliamentary majority, largely as a result of intimidation. At an MDC rally in Harare's Kuwadzana township on Monday, 2,000 brave supporters gathered to hear MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai speak. Another 800 people watched the rally from across the street. \"We are interested to see Tsvangirai, but we are afraid to attend the rally,\" said one man. \"Zanu-PF can beat people who go to the rally.\" When asked if he would vote for the MDC, he looked over his shoulder and then nodded yes. Zimbabwe's white farmers have also been thoroughly intimidated. The two killed last month by Mr Mugabe's supporters were MDC members. In rallies across the country, the farmers have stood up with Zanu-PF leaders and pledged not to support the MDC. In the north, farmers turned in MDC T-shirts. In the Karoi area some agreed to make their vehicles available for campaigning by Zanu-PF. \"We were naive. We thought we could campaign openly for the MDC as if this were a free country,\" said a white farmer from central Zimbabwe. \"With hindsight we can see that we stood up too soon. Of course we can still vote for the MDC, but I don't know how this will affect our labour. They have been pushed one way and then the other. They have been badly beaten and intimidated.\" \"They [Zanu-PF] have won the first round, but the battle is not over yet,\" said Mrs Munashe. \"The main cause of people's dissatisfaction with Zanu-PF is the economy and that is getting worse.

      "body": "<p>When Henry Reynolds, a Cornishman, arrived in New Zealand in 1886 after some six months spent in a leaky boat, the anchor must have seemed a reassuringly safe and permanent symbol for his new dairy business. </p> <p>Reynolds set up butter production in the rolling hills of the Waikato - similar to the hills that feature in the background of the new ad for Anchor butter to be broadcast for the first time tomorrow. By 1896, when Reynolds sold the Anchor brand to the New Zealand Dairy Association, it had eight factories. </p> <p>New Zealand's reputation as a exporter of food to Britain was established by the end of the 19th century. Four years before Reynolds arrived in the country, the first refrigerated ships left New Zealand ports, sending butter, cheese, frozen lamb back to the old country. </p> <p>Agents from London would tour New Zealand buying butter and cheese to market under their own labels. Wide variations in prices made life difficult for the producers, who responded with farmer-owned cooperatives like the Dairy Association to market their produce. </p> <p>During the first world war Britain commandeered New Zealand's entire output of butter and cheese at a fixed price. The dairy companies liked this stability, and were reluctant to return to the previous system after the war, so several decided to amalgamate to market their products themselves in Britain, forming the New Zealand Dairy Cooperative Company in 1919, with the anchor as trademark. The first packets of Anchor butter arrived in Britain in the early 1920s bearing the slogan \"the Leading Brand of the Choicest Butter from the Loveliest Dairy Pastures in the World\". </p> <p>In 1929 the New Zealand Dairy Cooperative Company opened its own sales subsidiary in Britain, Empire Dairies. </p> <p>With the outbreak of war Empire Dairies found that the government was once again its sole British customer. New Zealand butter, imported at great risk, was packed in the same National Butter wrappers as the local product. </p> <p>With the war over, the industry decided to form a single marketing body for its products - the New Zealand Diary Products Marketing Commission, which later became the New Zealand Dairy Board - which promised farmers a guaranteed price. </p> <p>The 1950s and 1960s were good times for the brand.

      "bodyText": "When Henry Reynolds, a Cornishman, arrived in New Zealand in 1886 after some six months spent in a leaky boat, the anchor must have seemed a reassuringly safe and permanent symbol for his new dairy business. Reynolds set up butter production in the rolling hills of the Waikato - similar to the hills that feature in the background of the new ad for Anchor butter to be broadcast for the first time tomorrow. By 1896, when Reynolds sold the Anchor brand to the New Zealand Dairy Association, it had eight factories. New Zealand's reputation as a exporter of food to Britain was established by the end of the 19th century. Four years before Reynolds arrived in the country, the first refrigerated ships left New Zealand ports, sending butter, cheese, frozen lamb back to the old country. Agents from London would tour New Zealand buying butter and cheese to market under their own labels. Wide variations in prices made life difficult for the producers, who responded with farmer-owned cooperatives like the Dairy Association to market their produce. During the first world war Britain commandeered New Zealand's entire output of butter and cheese at a fixed price. The dairy companies liked this stability, and were reluctant to return to the previous system after the war, so several decided to amalgamate to market their products themselves in Britain, forming the New Zealand Dairy Cooperative Company in 1919, with the anchor as trademark. The first packets of Anchor butter arrived in Britain in the early 1920s bearing the slogan \"the Leading Brand of the Choicest Butter from the Loveliest Dairy Pastures in the World\". In 1929 the New Zealand Dairy Cooperative Company opened its own sales subsidiary in Britain, Empire Dairies. With the outbreak of war Empire Dairies found that the government was once again its sole British customer. New Zealand butter, imported at great risk, was packed in the same National Butter wrappers as the local product. With the war over, the industry decided to form a single marketing body for its products - the New Zealand Diary Products Marketing Commission, which later became the New Zealand Dairy Board - which promised farmers a guaranteed price. The 1950s and 1960s were good times for the brand. Sales grew to 30,000 tons a year. By 1969, Anchor had become Britain's biggest selling butter. In 1973, New Zealand's position as Britain's farm in the South Pacific was disrupted by British entry to the European Economic Community. New Zealand butter and cheese imports were subject to a decreasing annual quota. The company responded by diversifying the Anchor brand into other food products, not all of which were made from New Zealand ingredients. Spreadable butter, a product the New Zealand Dairy Board invented, was made for the British market using Belgian milk after the European commission ruled that it was not legally butter and so could not be imported under the annual quota. The ruling has now been overturned, and the company plans to go back to making it entirely with New Zealand milk. As British consumers have become more concerned about food safety, Anchor has taken advantage of New Zealand's clean, green image to promote its butter. The new ad campaign plays on the fact that the climate allows New Zealand farmers to keep cows out in the fields all year round rather than having to winter them under cover. The subtext is that New Zealand cows eat grass all the time, rather than being forced to eat other, processed feed. BSE - or mad-cow disease - is one topic which Anchor will not touch, even though it has never affected New Zealand herds. In the marketing business it is thought unwise to make too much of others' misfortune.",

      "body": "<p>Police in the Netherlands were last night still struggling formally to identify three young Irishmen butchered in an expensive apartment near the Hague in an apparently drug-related massacre.</p> <p>The Irish Republic, in the grip of a bloody turf war over the burgeoning drugs trade, is in shock. Although speculation suggests that the men, at most small-scale dealers, fell foul of Colombian or eastern European drugs gangs, fears are growing that Irish drugs barons are responsible.</p> <p>The men, all in their 20s and from the west of Ireland, were tortured and then shot. Their bodies were piled in the bathroom, doused in petrol and set on fire to conceal evidence.</p> <p>Two bodies were dismembered with knives. One is believed to have contained cavity filler, used to fill gaps between walls and window frames.</p> <p>A police source said: \"The victims were badly burned. They were mutilated and unrecognisable.\"</p> <p>Detectives in the Netherlands are embarrassed at their failure at first to realise that the men were murdered rather than victims of a blaze early last Saturday in the fifth floor flat at Scheveningen, a well-heeled seaside resort five miles from the capital. They fear they have missed vital evidence.</p> <p>Dental records and blood samples from relatives were among material passed to Dutch police yesterday. But it might be Monday before they can officially confirm the victims' identities.</p> <p>They found amphetamines and a tablet-pressing machine in the flat. They believe two of the men were manufacturing amphetamines and ecstasy. The third was visiting his elder brother on holiday.</p> <p>One of the victims was known to the garda national drugs unit. But detectives are working on the theory that they were small dealers who got out of their depth.</p> <p>The Netherlands is the vital source of supply of most drugs to the republic. Gardai and Dutch police have conducted 16 operations against drugs criminals in both countries in the past six months.</p> <p>One theory yesterday was that the two men, to boost their own operations, passed information to gardai about rivals' shipments. There were two major interceptions recently.</p> <p>Among five passports found in the charred remains of apartment 1058 were those of the three victims. Although convinced of their identities, Dutch police have not formally named them.</p> <p>Damien Monaghan, 25, was the eldest of 11 children from a housing estate in Cloughleigh, Co Clare. He moved to the Netherlands six years ago, and rented the two-bedroom flat last year.

      "bodyText": "Police in the Netherlands were last night still struggling formally to identify three young Irishmen butchered in an expensive apartment near the Hague in an apparently drug-related massacre. The Irish Republic, in the grip of a bloody turf war over the burgeoning drugs trade, is in shock. Although speculation suggests that the men, at most small-scale dealers, fell foul of Colombian or eastern European drugs gangs, fears are growing that Irish drugs barons are responsible. The men, all in their 20s and from the west of Ireland, were tortured and then shot. Their bodies were piled in the bathroom, doused in petrol and set on fire to conceal evidence. Two bodies were dismembered with knives. One is believed to have contained cavity filler, used to fill gaps between walls and window frames. A police source said: \"The victims were badly burned. They were mutilated and unrecognisable.\" Detectives in the Netherlands are embarrassed at their failure at first to realise that the men were murdered rather than victims of a blaze early last Saturday in the fifth floor flat at Scheveningen, a well-heeled seaside resort five miles from the capital. They fear they have missed vital evidence. Dental records and blood samples from relatives were among material passed to Dutch police yesterday. But it might be Monday before they can officially confirm the victims' identities. They found amphetamines and a tablet-pressing machine in the flat. They believe two of the men were manufacturing amphetamines and ecstasy. The third was visiting his elder brother on holiday. One of the victims was known to the garda national drugs unit. But detectives are working on the theory that they were small dealers who got out of their depth. The Netherlands is the vital source of supply of most drugs to the republic. Gardai and Dutch police have conducted 16 operations against drugs criminals in both countries in the past six months. One theory yesterday was that the two men, to boost their own operations, passed information to gardai about rivals' shipments. There were two major interceptions recently. Among five passports found in the charred remains of apartment 1058 were those of the three victims. Although convinced of their identities, Dutch police have not formally named them. Damien Monaghan, 25, was the eldest of 11 children from a housing estate in Cloughleigh, Co Clare. He moved to the Netherlands six years ago, and rented the two-bedroom flat last year. It cost \u00a3600 a month, expensive by Dutch standards. Monaghan lived with Vincent Costello, 29, from Bansha, near Cahir in Co Tipperary. Costello had been in the Netherlands for two years but returned home regularly. His younger brother Morgan, 22, who worked in a meat plant at Cahir, was visiting him on a week's holiday. His parents and three sisters had expected him home on Tuesday. Dutch police are also desperate to trace Vanessa Cope, 27, from Newry, Co Down, and are liaising with the RUC as well as garda. Her British passport was with the four Irish passports found, and they fear she too has been murdered. But one of the passports, that of John Nunan, 27, from Fermoy, Co Cork, turned out to be stolen. Mr Nunan, who reported it missing two years ago, was eliminated after speaking to gardai on Thursday. The three executions bring the republic's drug-related murder toll to 20 in as many months. Republican paramilitaries have been involved in several of the killings, most recently last weekend. The latest tally compares with 11 drug-related murders in the two years before the shooting of the journalist Veronica Guerin in June 1996. Gangs were then trying to expand their empires after the assassination in August 1994 of the crime boss Martin Cahill. The killings stopped when tough legislation was passed after Ms Guerin's death. Armed with new powers, garda broke up the drugs gang she had been investigating. It has big operations in Amsterdam. But the officers' success left a power vacuum. Would-be barons are vying again to take over parts of the highly lucrative trade, sparking violent confrontations. Irish detectives say some murders are related to turf wars. Other victims are accused of double-crosses. Two of the most horrific recent killings were of Darren Carey, 20, and Patrick Murray, 19, minor criminals working as couriers. They had flown to Amsterdam to collect \u00a330,000 worth of heroin, but Murray was arrested on his way home last November. Police seized the drugs. Their boss, a notorious figure in Dublin's underworld, was furious. Murray was kidnapped, stripped, tortured and shot in the back of the head. Carey was also killed. Their bodies were found in the Grand Canal, near Newcastle, Co Dublin, three months ago. Paramilitary murders are mostly seen as \"punishment\" attacks, cracking down on drugs use, a policy which has won republicans strong support in many badly afflicted inner-city areas. But some dealers are thought to be executed over a failure to hand over a cut of their takings. The Irish National Liberation Army last Saturday shot dead Pat Neville, 31, a father of six, in Dublin to avenge the machete murder of its volunteer Patrick Campbell, 22, who died in the city last October after a brutal fight with a drugs gang. The INLA claimed that it had been seeking to stamp out drugs use, but detectives instead suggested the fight began after a row over money. The IRA is suspected of killing Tommy Byrne, 41, a drugs dealer, six days ago, shooting him in the head as he drank outside a Dublin pub.

The company has so little to do that it has leased out some of its laboratories to competitors.",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations is again facing a crisis of credibility in Africa as at least 300 of its troops remained missing, taken hostage, or encircled by rebels in Sierra Leone yesterday, and new fighting broke out in Democratic Republic of Congo just as the UN plans to deploy there. Six civilian UN employees, including a four-man Russian helicopter crew, were released during the day from eastern Sierra Leone after intervention by President Charles Taylor of Liberia, but tension remained high in several towns where UN troops are based. From New York last night the UN confirmed that 300 of its men are hostages and at least 12 wounded. As the crisis deepened the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, talked by telephone to African leaders, and envoys were dispatched from several west African countries to Freetown in an attempt to confront the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leader, Foday Sankoh. \"He is already isolated and it is going to get worse,\" Mr Annan said. The secretary general persuaded six African leaders, including President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Muammar Gadafy of Libya, to put pressure on Mr Sankoh. \"They've told him to take action. They told him to release [the hostages]. They've tried to impress on him the seriousness of the situation.\" Britain is dispatching an advisory team to Freetown to assess technical support needed to enhance the UN force's effectiveness, Robin Cook said last night. It follows a request from the UN secretary general. The UN's new crisis is as grave as its miscalculation in Angola in 1992 election when a UN-monitored election plunged the country into a civil war worse than the previous 20 years of fighting. Underlining the long-term effects of such a failure, the UN yesterday announced a $100m (\u00a365.5m) shortfall in funding for the humanitarian programme for Angola. The events in Sierra Leone this week have cast a shadow over the current UN security council mission to central Africa, aimed at putting a 5,500-strong UN peacekeeping force into Congo. The UN troops are intended to keep alive a fragile ceasefire involving half a dozen countries from Zimbabwe and Angola to Rwanda and Uganda who back rival forces in Congo. Yesterday a summit meeting of all the forces and their outside backers planned for the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, was cancelled after heavy fighting in the north-east of the country. Ugandan troops attacked their former allies from Rwanda before dawn just out side the rebel-held Congolese city of Kisangani and at least five civilians died in the crossfire, according to a UN official. \"There is shelling all over Kisangani,\" he said. Kisangani is one of the four points the UN plans to install its peace monitors. Colonel Akram Hossain, who heads a four-man preliminary UN observer mission in Kisangani, blamed Ugandan troops for the clashes - the first since the two sides fought a three-day battle in the town in August last year. \"It was initiated by the UPDF [Ugandan amy] and since then there has been shelling and intermittent firing all around the town,\" Col Hossain said. Rwandan military sources said their troops were under orders not to respond, but the shelling by Uganda's 120mm mortar shells and anti-aircraft guns became heavier until they had to choose between surrendering or firing back. \"We want to defuse things - we have no reason to fight with the Ugandans,\" said a Rwandan military spokesman, Major Emmanual Ndahiro. Sources in both Uganda and Rwanda were pessimistic about any early reconciliation between the two former allies who have large military presences inside Congo. In Sierra Leone the former rebels of the RUF, similarly unprepared for peace, continued to deny that they held any UN hostages. A spokesman for Mr Sankoh said they were not aware of any hostages being held, apart from the five civilians released yesterday. But Mr Sankoh, many miles from the various front lines, and long out of touch with the commanders of the various RUF units, does not have the authority to make the peace process and disarmament a reality. UN officials said that the explosion of tension this week was linked to RUF commanders' demands for the return to their units of combatants who have handed in weapons to the UN, received indemnities, and were being prepared for demobilisation, as agreed in the peace treaty signed in Lome last July. Part of the peace deal was a controversial amnesty for Mr Sankoh and his fighters. A UN spokesman yesterday emphasised that the amnesty did not cover any events after the peace treaty of July 1999.",

      "bodyText": "The sportswear manufacturer Nike has withdrawn millions of dollars of sponsorship from three American universities because of the activities of campus-based anti-sweatshop groups. The move is the latest in a running battle between leading multinational firms and the student anti-sweatshop movement which has mushroomed on campuses during the last year. In the past three weeks, Nike has withdrawn from financial arrangements worth more than $50m (\u00a330m) with the University of Oregon, the University of Michigan and Brown University. The sports firm had provided free equipment for the universities' sports teams and had made large donations and endowments. Nike objects to the demands being made by the Workers Rights Consortium, a body made up of students, university and union officials, and human rights campaigners. The WRC, which campaigns for improved working conditions in countries which produce clothes for the western markets, supports unannounced visits to factories and minimum working conditions. Nike has said it provides better working conditions than its competitors and makes a conscious effort to ensure that its factories operate fairly and humanely. The company supports another monitoring group, the Fair Labour Association, which the WRC claims is dominated by companies and does not carry out tough enough inspections. Last month Phil Knight, Nike's chairman and founder, announced that he would not be making a $30m donation to his alma mater, the University of Oregon, because the company considered the WRC, which has branches in nearly 50 universities, unfriendly towards business in general. Nike has also accused the WRC of being a tool of the US unions, which have been unhappy at seeing manufacturing jobs go abroad. Since then, Nike has broken its links with Michigan and Brown universities. The company equipped the Michigan athletics teams in a deal worth around $22m over six years and the men's and women's ice hockey squads at Brown. Michigan is now negotiating with other sports manufacturers, including Adidas, Puma and Reebok. One Michigan athlete was quoted as saying: \"The swoosh [Nike's logo] is just a symbol. The person makes the player, not the shoes.\" The question of whether US manufacturers are using sweatshops at home and abroad has become an important issue in student politics. Last month, 12 university administration buildings were occupied by students objecting to the administration's investment policies. Increasingly, student bodies are demanding that the universities should only engage in \"ethical investments\", and companies deemed to use sweated labour have been targeted in pickets and demonstrations. Such is the interest in the issue that the Museum of Tolerance in los Angeles has staged a special sweatshop exhibition, detailing the history of sweatshop labour and campaigns against it.",

But that could prove to be a bit of a mouthful to heart patients in Orkney. They are being prescribed herrings instead of pills. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower blood fat levels and reduce blood pressure, the fish is being handed out to patients instead of the more conventional beta-blockers or cholesterol-reducing drugs usually favoured by GPs. For those who don't like the taste of herrings, tinned sardines are also available at the surgery in Stromness, which has 2,800 patients. Each week Andrew Trevett dispenses two portions of marinated fish from the surgery's fridge to people who have survived heart attacks or suffer from coronary heart disease. Doctors decided it was a logical step to persuade patients to eat more fish in their diet - by prescribing it. Patients are further reminded of the health benefits by posters around the building stating that oily fish can reduce the chance of a second heart attack by up to 30%. Stan Headley, a patient who survived a major heart attack two years ago, now eats a daily diet including sardines for lunch, trout for dinner and herrings for supper. \"The concept of getting fish on prescription seemed pretty radical to me - it was the last thing I expected.\" Mr Headley, a keen fisherman, said he was happy to change his diet, but not all fishermen enjoyed eating fish. He has also had a complete lifestyle change and has been encouraged to give up smoking a pipe and run a mile each day to make him healthier. Fiona Holgate, of the Orkney Health Board, which is fund ing the scheme, said: \"A lot of people used to eat salt fish in Orkney, but it no longer forms a major part of their diet. \"We are trying to encourage them to eat it because it is so good for them.

The Mexican anti-drug chief, Mariano Herran Salvatti, said an anti-drugs unit battled its way into a house near the town of Ensenada in Baja California state on Wednesday and arrested Ismael \"El Mayel\" Higuera Guerrero. Mr Higuera Guerrero was wanted for the 1993 murder of an attorney general's office head and is regarded as the chief of the Arellano Felix brothers' drug smuggling, execution, kidnapping and bribery operations, he said. \"He's the main operator of the organisation,\" Mr Herran Salvatti said. \"This is a major blow. We are witnessing the dismantling of the Arellano Felix organisation.\" Led by the brothers Ramon Eduardo, Benjamin and Javier, the organisation, based in the wild border town of Tijuana, is considered one of Mexico's most bloodthirsty drug gangs, and rivals the Colombian cartels in its power and wealth. The US drug enforcement administration applauded the arrest as \"a major victory for both Mexican and US law enforcement\". \"Higuera Guerrero's apprehension is a significant step toward bringing the leaders of the notorious Arellano Felix drug mafia to justice,\" a spokesman said. The arrest - apparently as a result of an anonymous tip from a neighbour \"scandalised\" by Mr Higuera Guerrero's drinking, partying and gun-firing - was the second recent blow for the Arellano Felix. Last month, announcing a crackdown against the organisation, Mexican authorities arrested its alleged financial controller, Jesus \"El Chuy\" Labra. The cartel began a spree of retaliatory killings. It is suspected of being behind this month's murder of three anti-drug agents near Tijuana and the assassination of the city's police chief, officials said. On Wednesday night, as rumours of the arrest of \"El Mayel\" spread, unknown gunmen fired shots at the official residence of President Ernesto Zedillo in Mexico City. But Mr Herran Salvatti denied that there was a link between the crackdown on the cartel and the drive-by shooting. The anti-drug chief said that police and troops were led to a house near Ensenada after a telephone tip-off. When they approached the house, they were shot at. Police and soldiers stormed the building but then came under fire from Mr Higuera Guerrero, who was hiding on the second floor.

      "body": "<p>Last week I mentioned some of the truly terrible aspects of British life, and I'm grateful for your response, to which I shall return. But on Tuesday I went to what was the naffest occasion I think I've ever attended - the Sony radio awards at the Grosvenor House hotel. I must confess that I and my colleagues hoped we were going to win an award for the News Quiz but I promise, I swear, that the sense of being overwhelmed by terminal naffness began long before we learned we'd lost. </p> <p>There was the roped-off VIP reception we all had to pass on our way to the cash bar, where a gin and tonic cost \u00a37. Then the clothes: all those ruffled shirts, bow ties like monarch butterflies, and paisley waistcoats worn over massive paunches, so that the place looked like a bouncers' convention in a Bournemouth nightclub. </p> <p>Next, the 1,300 or so guests had to fight their way through crammed tables to their seats, pushing past waitresses who were already serving the first course. And the lighting was purple and blue, so the food looked like nuclear waste on a plate. After that things got worse. </p> <p>Every time I'm rude about Radio 1, someone writes to say: \"Oh, but you must listen to Mark and Lard in the afternoon, they're hilarious.\" So I looked forward to their stint presenting a batch of awards. They began with an eight-minute turn which won not a single titter from the audience. Not one audible voice was raised in laughter. I felt sorry for them. We've all died on our feet - I often have - but to die in front of 1,300 of your colleagues in the trade! If it were a dream, you'd wake up sweating with horror. </p> <p>Somehow they kept going, and introduced Ulrika Jonsson, who is pregnant. A fat man called \"Jono\" Coleman from some commercial station came on and told the assembled company: \"I've just been informed by Ulrika that I'm not the father, but with a huge schlong like mine, it's hard to keep the sperm in the condom!\" </p> <p>\"Well done, Jono!\" said Mark, or it might have been Lard. I finished my main course and pushed off into the night.Somehow I'd vaguely thought of radio as a last vestige of civilisation, but we seem to have lost that too. </p> <p> A far pleasanter occasion was the Hatchard's Authors of the Year reception the next night. It was full of strange juxtapositions. Frances Partridge, the last surviving member of the Bloomsbury Group, who turned 100 in March, was there, talking to Gyles Brandreth, who squatted in front of her wearing that strange, shiny smile people adopt when talking to the very old. All that talk, all that bed-hopping, all that writing and arguing and drinking, and it comes to this: sitting immobile while Brandreth smiles at you like a retarded Moonie. </p> <p>Then a colleague went for a word with Roger Katz, the bookshop's popular manager. \"Can't stop now,\" he said cheerily, \"I'm just dashing upstairs to find a copy of Marcus Aurelius for Jack Higgins!\" </p> <p>\u0095 After I watched Dallas Night on Channel 4, I caught up with the news about Zimbabwe and, oddly enough, the two events blended together. Years ago, some time after independence, a colleague and I gave a lift to a \"troopie\", a young white soldier who was just back from visiting South Africa, an industrial country which must have seemed as strange and exotic to someone from the essentially rural Rhodesia as New York would to a Mexican peasant. He was terrifically excited by the divided highways. Did we have them in England? We explained that, yes, we did have dual carriageways and he seemed a little disappointed. \"In Sith Ifrica thi hivv colour tilivision!\" he said. Did we have colour TV in England? Again, our response seemed to make him rueful. So when he asked if we had Dallas on English TV, to cheer him up, I asked: \"Who do you think shot JR?\" </p> <p>There was a stunned silence from the back of the car. \"Somebody has shot JR?\" he asked in a strangulated voice. I realised that in the past anthropologists judged how advanced a society was by when they discovered fire and invented the wheel. In the modern age, it's how far they have reached in the latest hit American soap opera. </p> <p>\u0095 The appalling South-west trains have a new trick. Sometimes the train leaves our local station early. This is because the timetable allows more time for it to get from the previous station than it needs. Since there's no clock on the station, the driver can't tell that he's leaving too soon, and so frequently does, sometimes by a whole minute. We've asked to have a clock installed, but they say it would cost too much. Presumably Mr Brian Souter, who is co-owner of the company, needs the cash to pursue his ferocious campaign against the repeal of Section 28 in Scotland. </p> <p>After I missed one train, the next ran 10 minutes behind schedule, so I was very late for my appointment - a common experience when you depend on Mr Souter's monopoly to get you anywhere. As I waited in the cold (of course there's no waiting room), I reflected that he really does offer an equal opportunity business. Us straights living in the suburbs with our families are condemned to a dreadful train service partly so that 400 miles north, Mr Souter can pursue his vendetta against a minority which probably feels quite oppressed enough already.</p>",

I finished my main course and pushed off into the night.Somehow I'd vaguely thought of radio as a last vestige of civilisation, but we seem to have lost that too. A far pleasanter occasion was the Hatchard's Authors of the Year reception the next night. It was full of strange juxtapositions. Frances Partridge, the last surviving member of the Bloomsbury Group, who turned 100 in March, was there, talking to Gyles Brandreth, who squatted in front of her wearing that strange, shiny smile people adopt when talking to the very old. All that talk, all that bed-hopping, all that writing and arguing and drinking, and it comes to this: sitting immobile while Brandreth smiles at you like a retarded Moonie. Then a colleague went for a word with Roger Katz, the bookshop's popular manager. \"Can't stop now,\" he said cheerily, \"I'm just dashing upstairs to find a copy of Marcus Aurelius for Jack Higgins!\" \u0095 After I watched Dallas Night on Channel 4, I caught up with the news about Zimbabwe and, oddly enough, the two events blended together. Years ago, some time after independence, a colleague and I gave a lift to a \"troopie\", a young white soldier who was just back from visiting South Africa, an industrial country which must have seemed as strange and exotic to someone from the essentially rural Rhodesia as New York would to a Mexican peasant. He was terrifically excited by the divided highways. Did we have them in England? We explained that, yes, we did have dual carriageways and he seemed a little disappointed. \"In Sith Ifrica thi hivv colour tilivision!\" he said. Did we have colour TV in England? Again, our response seemed to make him rueful. So when he asked if we had Dallas on English TV, to cheer him up, I asked: \"Who do you think shot JR?\" There was a stunned silence from the back of the car. \"Somebody has shot JR?\" he asked in a strangulated voice. I realised that in the past anthropologists judged how advanced a society was by when they discovered fire and invented the wheel. In the modern age, it's how far they have reached in the latest hit American soap opera. \u0095 The appalling South-west trains have a new trick. Sometimes the train leaves our local station early. This is because the timetable allows more time for it to get from the previous station than it needs. Since there's no clock on the station, the driver can't tell that he's leaving too soon, and so frequently does, sometimes by a whole minute. We've asked to have a clock installed, but they say it would cost too much. Presumably Mr Brian Souter, who is co-owner of the company, needs the cash to pursue his ferocious campaign against the repeal of Section 28 in Scotland. After I missed one train, the next ran 10 minutes behind schedule, so I was very late for my appointment - a common experience when you depend on Mr Souter's monopoly to get you anywhere. As I waited in the cold (of course there's no waiting room), I reflected that he really does offer an equal opportunity business. Us straights living in the suburbs with our families are condemned to a dreadful train service partly so that 400 miles north, Mr Souter can pursue his vendetta against a minority which probably feels quite oppressed enough already.",

But there will be readers seeking a more inclusive view of his achievement, for whom earlier work, including poems in the lyric vein that he never abandoned, remains undiminished by later work with a more public stance. </p> <p>Restlessness characterised the Oliver I knew: he moved from Cambridge to Paris, to Coventry, to Brightlingsea, back to Paris, to New York, to Paris again, where he finally seemed to settle. Born in Southampton, he went late to the University of Essex, having left school at 16, before becoming a journalist on local newspapers in Cambridge and Coventry (the latter stint yielding a deadpan interview with Philip Larkin, hilarious for insiders who knew that a poet was asking the questions), and at Agence France-Presse. </p> <p>He has been acclaimed as a political poet on the basis of a utopian vision of human community, yet his journalist's feel for actuality led him to posit hope as utopian, and secreted somewhere was a Calvinist instinct of terror and guilt.

I spend little time studying either effluent, but I think on the whole that the water you find in ditches - which may be stagnant and smelly and have the odd old shoe in it but is full of the works of nature - is rather less dull than the mix of old bits of carrot, Tesco baked bean, shreds of rice and coffee grounds which you tend to find in dishwater. I await advice from psychologists.",

Several emissaries sent by negotiators attempting to free the hostages were able to visit the Abu Sayyaf kidnappers at their hide-out on Jolo island in the Philippines on Thursday, the sources said. Acting on the report, a team of negotiators sent by the chief government negotiator, Nur Misuari, arrived in Jolo yesterday and planned to go into the mountains to meet the kidnappers. The emissaries' account contradicted earlier reports that the hostages had been divided up and were being held in five different locations and that some had either died during a clash with the military or had escaped. It also indicates that the kidnappers may have managed to break through hundreds of troops and police encircling them. The cordon had been formed earlier in the week, and a series of clashes erupted on Tuesday and Wednesday as the rebels attempted to escape. On Wednesday, troops seized the simple bamboo hut where the hostages had been held and found three room keys from the Sipadan Island Resort, the Malaysian diving resort from which the hostages were abducted on April 23. The rebels had threatened to behead two foreign hostages if the military did not pull its troops away from the area, but the government said they would stay. \"Our policy in this situation is containment in response to the request of foreign governments,\" the presidential executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora, said. \"We don't want to assault the area where the hostages are being held, but we cannot allow the kidnappers to get away either.\" A rebel leader, Abu Escobar, said in an interview broadcast on a local radio station yesterday that the group is discussing whether to go ahead with the threat if the military does not stop its rescue operations. \"We will see.

The Jolo hostages include 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French nationals, two South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino. On the nearby island of Basilan, troops continued to search for Abu Sayyaf rebels who are believed still to be holding several people from a separate group of 27 Filipino hostages seized nearly seven weeks ago, the military said.

Postcards from Cobh (Cork) where the ship called before heading out into the Atlantic have proved particularly popular. Some Titanic items feature in the Sotheby's auction of marine works of art running online until May 15 at www.sothebys.amazon.com. This follows a sale at Sotheby's in London earlier this week which centred on the story of Sarah Roth, who sailed on Titanic to join her fianc\u00e9 in America. Sarah and Daniel Iles had been childhood sweethearts and when the young man emigrated to America in search of a better life, she agreed to wait and follow him when he had found work and made some money. A year later, in 1912, when Daniel sent her the money for the fare to join him in New York, Sarah managed to secure one of the last third-class tickets on the maiden voyage of White Star Line's new flagship. Sarah survived the disaster - which claimed 1,500 lives - but lost everything, including the wedding dress she had made herself. The exception was her handbag containing her third class inspection card and that day's menu card, which she clutched tightly as she clambered aboard a lifeboat. Six hours later she was plucked from the freezing cold by RMS Carpathia, which had responded to Titanic's emergency signal. Eight days after the sinking Sarah married Daniel, a shipping clerk, at St Vincent's Hospital in New York. She wore a wedding gown bought with money which had been donated by a local women's relief committee in New York. Their bridesmaid, Emily Badman, was another survivor of the disaster. The inspection card made \u00a312, 925, the menu card was bought by a British collector bidding by telephone for \u00a320, 560, while her ticket holder went for \u00a31,175. Also sold, for \u00a31,530, was a collection of correspondence written after the event. This included letters which related to Sarah's claim for compensation for the property she lost in the disaster - including the original wedding dress she had made before leaving home. The letters include a dramatic account of how she \"... woke up feeling that the ship had stopped. I dressed and went outside my cabin. \"Here I had a conversation with my friend and her husband and we waited for some considerable time when seeing some officers or stewards... we asked them what was the matter and they said that the ship had struck an iceberg, but added that there was no danger and nothing to be alarmed about.\" However, another officer ordered her to fit her lifebelt and proceed towards the second class deck - at which point she grabbed her handbag containing the menu, her inspection card and the ticket holder. Sarah saw other third-class passengers being barred by a gate from getting near the lifeboats, although she was directed towards a ladder leading to the upper boat deck where she found collapsible lifeboat C about to be lowered. Sarah's third class menu, which she had slipped into her handbag on the evening of the disaster, is believed to be the only one of its kind. It shows that she and her fellow passengers had enjoyed smoked herrings for breakfast, roast beef for lunch and cold meats and pickles for tea. On the reverse of the menu the numbers of passengers and those that subsequently died or were rescued are listed in pencil, possibly by Sarah herself. No other third class menu is known to exist. Sarah's inspection card is believed to be unique because so few people survived among the lower classes. It relates to the daily inspections for head lice and diseases such as tuberculosis which were carried out among the lower-class passengers throughout the voyage. The card was stamped in English, Swedish, French, German, Italian, Finnish, Croatian and Dutch. The collection was sold at Sotheby's by the couple's great-grandson David Slossar, a real estate manager from Connecticut, who inherited the archive from his grandfather Albert Iles on his death last year.

Hot on the heels of BMW's announcement that it would sell off the Rover Group we have Ford's bombshell that it plans to end volume car production at Dagenham.</p> <p>It's no surprise that Tony Blair has dived into the fray: these developments raise real question marks over the UK's future as a manufacturing centre. But we should be very careful what conclusions we draw.</p> <p>For one thing, these decisions reflect huge over- capacity in the European car industry. Ford CEO Jac Nasser recently commented that installed European manufacturing capacity is 20m cars, contrasted with annual sales of less than 16m.

      "bodyText": "These are extraordinary, worrying times for the UK auto industry. Hot on the heels of BMW's announcement that it would sell off the Rover Group we have Ford's bombshell that it plans to end volume car production at Dagenham. It's no surprise that Tony Blair has dived into the fray: these developments raise real question marks over the UK's future as a manufacturing centre. But we should be very careful what conclusions we draw. For one thing, these decisions reflect huge over- capacity in the European car industry. Ford CEO Jac Nasser recently commented that installed European manufacturing capacity is 20m cars, contrasted with annual sales of less than 16m. This restructuring, in short, could have been seen coming down the pike some time ago. To say that Ford will also be closing assembly plants in Poland and Portugal hardly helps. The time has clearly come for a rethink of the whole sector. Which makes the sustainability strategy launched by the UK Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) topical. Its preparation, it should be said, predated the news from BMW and Ford, but its conclusions are worth reading in the wake of these momentous announcements. The industry, the SMMT notes in Towards Sustainability: The Automotive Sector Strategy, is the UK's largest - and is also the first to commit to public reporting on its progress towards long-term sustainability. Readers, however, will not find any mention of any impending shakeout. A real pity, since there is no time like a crisis to focus minds on the future. At this point, I should declare an interest, having contributed a \"stakeholder comment\" to the report. Worryingly, it notes, \"some trends are steering in the wrong direction\". Not the threatened closures, in this case, but the growing taste for huge, gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles (SUVs). As a result, it is said, vehicles now being scrapped are often more fuel-efficient than those in the showrooms or on sale over the internet. Some people in the industry are deeply uncomfortable with this line of argument. If consumers want to buy SUVs, they say, surely that is a way of securing the long-term future of at least some companies? Well, maybe, but if I had to pick industry sectors certain to come under intense pressure over the next decade in terms of their triple bottom line performance, car-makers would be right there in front rank. To be sure, there is good news in the SMMT report, which is the first in a planned series. For one thing, the industry has voluntarily committed to cut its carbon dioxide emissions from new cars by 25% by 2008. A useful start. There is also a growing acceptance, if not yet a real enthusiasm, for the \"take-back\" laws proposed across the EU for \"end-of-life\" vehicles requiring recycling. But the \"continue-to-improve\" targets scattered through the report can only be the beginning. This sector will be swept by what the economist Joseph Schumpeter dubbed \"waves of creative destruction\". Unless it acts fast, paying real attention to likely trends in sustainable mobility, much of the industry will find itself consigned to the dustbin of history. \u0095 John Elkington is chairman of strategy consultants SustainAbility (www.sustainability.co.uk.)

I think it was when the Unilever board supported our plan to invest heavily in laundry tablets. What was your greatest mistake? Back in 1989, launching the Radion detergent with decidedly dodgy advertising. Which deal would you most like to have done? Selling the houses I've bought at the times I bought them. What do you find most annoying in your staff? They are a constant reminder that they deserve better leadership! Does your organisation have a glass ceiling? I'd like to say no, but the stats would suggest otherwise. But we are actively addressing the issue. What management wisdom is most overrated? The supremacy of strategy. Most strategies are obvious and copyable. Boldness and skill in execution is the differentiator. What one lesson would you pass on to young managers? Get a reputation for honouring your commitments. Which management guru do you believe in? None. I am deeply sceptical of prophets, fads and fanatics. Who is your management hero? Every woman who successfully juggles the demands of career and home life. Who is your favourite politician? Gordon Brown, for intellect, courage and substance over style. How much were you paid last year? Plenty, except in relation to my responsibility for turnover and profit. What phrase or saying do you most overuse? I overuse, \"get to the point\" and \"give it a lash\" in equal measure. Apart from your family, what else makes you happiest in life? Driving an open car on a sunny day, singing along to Counting Crows. What annoys you most? Life is too short - that stops me from exploring some interesting lifestyle options. How do you relax? Mainly by playing sport, travelling and listening to music. What was your last cultural experience? I was in the Tate last week - part hoping, part pretending, to understand. What is your favourite city? Madrid, where I spent three years, for its tradition, modernity, sophistication, fun and sun. What is your greatest regret? Not spending enough time with my children. What is your biggest fear? Running out of inspiring challenges. What will be the big business issue of the next decade? The shift in power and rewards from investors of capital to investors of life-time employees and managers. What would you really like to have been? A good singer-songwriter.",

      "body": "<p>Around the corner from the new Tate, in Delfina Studios' new project space, Steve McQueen has just installed a new work, his first outing in London since winning last year's Turner prize. The Tate has a work on display too - McQueen's 1993 film installation Bear, featuring two naked wrestlers. </p> <p>Over the past few years McQueen has astonished his audience with his manipulation of subtle images - the artist rolling an oil drum through New York, a wonky view of the sky above his head, a balloon taking off into the blue, and a wall collapsing around him. His new work, Cold Breath, is no less arresting and complex. </p> <p>A light flashes on and off in a long, thin corridor. A TV faces out across the narrow space. It is a deceptive come-on, and I walk gingerly between the walls. There's an image on the screen. I walk past the television and take a turn, where more pulsating light leads me on into a large dark space. I turn. The same film is running, a big, cinematic image on the wall. </p> <p>The first time I didn't quite believe it. It was, I imagined, a close-up, a detail of a bigger picture. But no. On the screen is McQueen's nipple, and the patch of goosebumped skin around it. Fingers and thumb hove into view, huge and purposeful. They pull at the nipple, yank and tweak it erect. The fingers go into a blurred frenzy, and it is clear that, at times, McQueen is more concerned with pleasuring himself than with staying in focus in front of the lens. </p> <p>For long moments, the nipple remains alone. The bare chest looks like a lunar landscape, the nipple and its aureola an image from the dark side of the moon. Then he's at it again. I'm reminded of Billie Whitelaw's mouth, filling the screen in the TV production of Samuel Beckett's Not I. The speaking mouth, that wet, fleshy, involuted organ, eventually becomes something alien and alarmingly mobile. Now the hairless nipple looks like an eye. The nipple looks back, all-seeing, like the jailer's eye framed in the cell peephole in Jean Genet's great film Chant d'Amour. </p> <p>Like Genet's still subversive film, McQueen's Cold Breath makes you wonder about your sexuality. It is as erotic as it is absurd. I mean, men's nipples? Why does no one discuss how erogenous they are? </p> <p>McQueen compares his singular image to the eye-cutting scene from Bunuel and Dali's Surrealist film Un Chien Andalou. The Andalusian dog in question was the poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca, who studied with Bunuel and Dali in Madrid, and whose gayness troubled them both. The references keep on coming: to the eroticism in Joyce's Ulysses, to the film Robert Having His Nipple Pierced, featuring Robert Mapplethorpe. Overtly gay images, like Wolfgang Tillmans's photo of his late boyfriend masturbating and wearing a pair of heavy-duty nipple-clamps, also come to mind, if only because the erotic potential of the male breast has, unaccountably, been seen as a queer thing. </p> <p>\"Lots of people assumed I was gay,\" McQueen says about his early works, Bear and Five Easy Pieces. \"I didn't mind,\" he smiles, but it raised the question of why sensual depictions of the male body are almost inexorably given a homoerotic spin. Don't straight men like having their nipples played with? </p> <p>McQueen, talking about the strange hinterland between pleasure and pain occasioned by tweaking your nipples, points to the middle of his forehead, the third eye, and says, \"The feeling's here, sharp, and one reason I wanted to work with the image of the nipple was that it is like an eye. I have a lazy eye, a squint that had to be surgically corrected, and there was something about the image of the single nipple_\" </p> <p>When McQueen fumbles for words, it is because he is trying to work out what only his work can tell you. He has great intellectual honesty, but doesn't take any shit. \"My work is not a crossword puzzle. I get so pissed off when people ask me to explain it. I make these works to discover something, not to explain anything.\" </p> <p>To me, Cold Breath is about the space between the lens and the body. It strikes me that its subject is that disembodied sensation of being behind the lens, making a film, and the narcissistic, subju gated and objectified feeling one has being in the camera's gaze. McQueen has dramatised the narcissistic moment. The viewer is also in the frame. It's easy to laugh at talk about desire and the gaze as though they were concepts to be kicked to death by Cultural Studies pedants, but they exist. McQueen never lets you forget it. </p> <p>McQueen was working on Cold Breath before the Turner prize announcement. Like everyone else who's ever been nominated, he found that the experience resembled a horrible, numbing war. He now spends most of his time in Amsterdam, with his partner and child, out of the public eye. He's working on a film with author Zadie Smith and cult musician Tricky, who's living in New York and weaned off the cocktail of prescribed drugs he was taking to tamp down his asthma, but that drove him nearly bonkers. If what they end up with is half so strange, so complicated and so direct as Cold Breath, I can't wait. </p> <p>\u0095 Cold Breath is at Delfina Project Space, 51 Southwark Street, London SE1 (020-7357 6600), till May 28.</p>",

Here, Maxwell Davies affects the conventional pattern of fast-slow-fast, and a basically tonal trajectory of tension and release. Outwardly, the grand line of the first section has an easy flow, especially with a soloist of the finesse of Richard Watkins, and climaxes seem sonorous and well-constructed. It is just that the music's inner dynamic and momentum do not come across coherently. </p> <p>Roma, Amor, Labyrinthos is a fusion of Maxwell Davies's referential and abstract styles, in which Rome's traffic, bells and monuments are integrated into a quasi- symphonic structure. In the second movement, a melancholy, plainchant-inspired texture is juxtaposed with disturbingly raucous folk music, before a final, beatific image of ancient choral music.

But radio awards used to be different because a) there were so few of them and b) radio seemed like a small-scale, domestic and creative enterprise whose crafted excellence could do with celebration. </p> <p>All that has changed, as I was reminded at the tacky Sony awards bash in London on Tuesday. Greg Dyke's appointment notwithstanding, BBC Radio's best producers must now make do with prizes for their programmes instead of money to make them - and it shows. Meanwhile, commercial radio, much of which is owned by a trio of large groups, is so formatted that innovation is a foreign word. </p> <p>Sony's prize-givers included a stream of C-list female celebrities whose connection to radio was dubious and whose most articulate feature was their cleavage. (Oh, and let's not forget rent-a-heckle Tracey Emin, extolling radio for the short-sighted.) This may guarantee the sponsor tabloid spreads the next day, but it seems a long time since the Sonys played tantalising extracts from winning programmes. No, Sony night is now unequivocally junket night. </p> <p>Paul Gambaccini, one of the hosts, demonstrated his ability to get it wrong by claiming that the awards unite the industry.

      "bodyText": "Film and television awards ceremonies have long been lampooned for their celebrity gush and borrowed couture. But radio awards used to be different because a) there were so few of them and b) radio seemed like a small-scale, domestic and creative enterprise whose crafted excellence could do with celebration. All that has changed, as I was reminded at the tacky Sony awards bash in London on Tuesday. Greg Dyke's appointment notwithstanding, BBC Radio's best producers must now make do with prizes for their programmes instead of money to make them - and it shows. Meanwhile, commercial radio, much of which is owned by a trio of large groups, is so formatted that innovation is a foreign word. Sony's prize-givers included a stream of C-list female celebrities whose connection to radio was dubious and whose most articulate feature was their cleavage. (Oh, and let's not forget rent-a-heckle Tracey Emin, extolling radio for the short-sighted.) This may guarantee the sponsor tabloid spreads the next day, but it seems a long time since the Sonys played tantalising extracts from winning programmes. No, Sony night is now unequivocally junket night. Paul Gambaccini, one of the hosts, demonstrated his ability to get it wrong by claiming that the awards unite the industry. While broadcasters and producers move freely between commercial and BBC radio, there is a chasm between the two sectors in output and Sony awards. Each year the categories are changed to enable commercial radio to win more prizes. And each year they fail. This year was no exception, with only seven of the 24 awards going to commercial stations.

      "body": "<p>'After reading The Maltese Falcon, I went mooning about in a daze of love such as I had not known for any character in literature since I encountered Sir Launcelot,\" Dorothy Parker wrote in the New Yorker in 1931, adding that she had read the book 30 or 40 times in the two years after its publication. </p> <p>The cynical journalist wasn't the only woman felled by Spade, or his creator: dozens went to bed with Dashiell Hammett when he moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles to join the throng trying to make money in Hollywood. Lillian Hellman even left her husband in Los Angeles to follow Hammett to New York in 1931. </p> <p>Sam Spade made Hammett famous and, for a short time, rich. The man who had been unable to feed his family a few years before started getting $2,000 a week from Paramount to come up with original story lines. Hammett threw the money away on his idea of the high life: lavish parties that cost as much as $10,000; long weekends of drinking with starlets and writers in California; and some of it on settling a claim of forcible rape by a young actress. </p> <p>Everyone who reads Hammett seems to read their own needs into his work: where Dorothy Parker found Sir Launcelot, Senator Joe McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee saw communism. Hammett spent six months in a federal prison in 1951 when he refused to testify to Congress about the Civil Rights Congress, an organisation on whose board he sat which provided bail to communists. </p> <p>A few years after leaving prison, Hammett was back in front of Congress, this time before McCarthy's committee. The senator believed Hammett could only have named his first novel Red Harvest because he was a red himself. (While it's true that, in the 30s and 40s, Hammett openly supported the Communist party, publisher Blanche Knopf actually named Red Harvest, as she thought Hammett's original title, Poisonville, would put readers off.) McCarthy even went so far as to remove copies of Hammett's novels from all American embassies so that State Department employees wouldn't be exposed to his communist writings. When Hammett died in 1961, a veteran of the first and second world wars as well as the McCarthy era blacklist, the FBI tried to stop his burial in Arlington. </p> <p>Other readers have seen equally unusual landscapes in Hammett's work. One recent critic says The Maltese Falcon is an elaborate allegory about American foreign policy in the decade following the first world war, with the seductive sexuality of Brigid O'Shaughnessy representing the European seductions that drew America into the war, and the death of Spade's partner representing the useless deaths that war brings in its wake. Modernist critics claim Hammett was making a serious critique of the automobile; neo-Marxists share Senator McCarthy's view that the work was thoroughly red, albeit with admiration. </p> <p>Hammett seemed to see his own face when he looked at Sam Spade. Aside from the fact that his own first name was Samuel (his mother called him by his middle name, Dashiell, to distinguish him from three other Samuels in the family) Hammett, too, had been a Pinkerton detective. In 1907, when he was 13, Hammett had to leave school to help support his family, but until he joined Pinkertons in 1915, he didn't stay at any job for more than a few months. </p> <p>When America entered the war, he joined the army as an ambulance driver, and in 1918, he contracted the flu in the terrible epidemic sweeping through army camps. His lungs were damaged so severely that for years he often didn't have the strength to get out of bed. He lived on a meagre disability check; his post-war Pinkerton stint only totalled four or five months, when he moved to the San Francisco area in search of a cure for his tubercular lungs. </p> <p>Although he exaggerated his role, and even his presence, in some of the agency's high-profile cases, he did have a first-hand knowledge of crime and criminals that other noir writers didn't possess. In a 1934 introduction to The Maltese Falcon, Hammett wrote: \"Spade had no original... he is what most of the private detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite a few in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your private detective does not want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes manner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of himself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in contact with, whether criminal, innocent by-stander or client.\" </p> <p>Somehow, in putting his private fantasy of himself on to paper, Hammett created a landscape into which each reader, from Dorothy Parker to Joe McCarthy and beyond, could project their own image. So I feel my own idiosyncratic reading of The Maltese Falcon fits into a tradition of highly personal reactions to the novel. When I read it, I see neither communists nor automobiles, but a world of dangerous female sexuality which Hammett found so terrifying that he needed to destroy it. </p> <p>There are three major women in the book: Iva Archer, a 30-something blonde of ripe sexual charms, married to Sam's partner Miles but having an affair with Sam; Effie Perine, who is Sam's secretary; and Brigid O'Shaughnessy, the client who sets the wheels of the story in motion. Effie, a boyish and guileless young woman, opens the story by ushering in Brigid, who is soft, stylish and appears touchingly shy and vulnerable. Effie knows Sam will want to see Brigid, because \"she's a knockout\". From the start, then, we know that Sam is a sexual being, and it becomes clear pretty soon that Brigid is as well. </p> <p>Brigid gives Sam an assumed name and an assumed story about a sister involved with a dangerous gangster. From that moment on we're involved in a deception of her making, which only Sam can see through and cut through. She kills his partner, gets Sam to do her dirty work in looking for the Falcon, so that she can double-cross her accomplices and then, at the end, tries to seduce Sam, so that she can get off the hook. Sam \"sends her over\" anyway, but only after an emotional struggle which causes the sweat to pour down his face. </p> <p>Brigid O'Shaughnessy is part of a traditional way of describing women in western culture, starting with Eve, who ruins paradise for Adam, and moving on to such contemporary characters as Alex Forrest in the movie Fatal Attraction. O'Shaughnessy is the first significant modern temptress, the first to appear after the first world war when women could vote, cut off their hair, cast off the 12 pounds of heavy clothes they wore in Victorian times and move freely in society. Like Eve, O'Shaughnessy uses her body to try to make the hero do bad things, but unlike Adam, Sam is too strong for the temptress. </p> <p>As a foil to O'Shaughnessy is Sam's secretary, Effie Perine. Sam never calls her Effie, though: she is sweetheart, darling, sister, and, especially angel. And Effie is an angel. In contrast to Brigid's sultry sensuality, Effie's \"eyes were brown and playful in a shiny boyish face\". The fact that she is boyish in her looks means that she is not a sexual, and therefore predatory, female. Sam can trust her, but her boyishness also makes her naive. She believes in Brigid: she tells Sam that, despite the two phoney identities the client has used: \"I'm for her. I don't care if she has all the names in the phone book. That girl is all right and you know it.\" </p> <p>At the end of the book, she cannot accept the fact that Sam sent Brigid over. Women work on intuition, as Sam tells her off and on throughout the novel, but a man has to deal in justice. </p> <p> \"So much for your woman's intuition,\"[Sam said]... [Effie's] voice was queer as the expression on her face. \"You did that, Sam, to her?\" He nodded. \"Your Sam's a detective.\" He looked sharply at her. He put his arm around her waist, his hand on her hip.\"She did kill Miles, angel,\" he said gently, \"offhand, like that.\" He snapped the fingers of his other hand. She escaped from his arm as if it had hurt her. \"Don't, please, don't touch me,\" she said brokenly. \"I know - I know you're right. You're right. But don't touch me now - not now.\" </p> <p>Still, Hammett recognises that Sam is not an innocent himself: he's been sleeping with Iva Archer, who is a blowsier, less sophisticated sexual animal than Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Right after the scene with Effie, Iva arrives. Effie returns to Sam's office to tell him that Iva is waiting. </p> <p> Spade, looking down at his desk, nodded almost imperceptibly. \"Yes,\" he said, and shivered. \"Well, send her in.\" </p> <p>The novel ends on this sombre note, with Sam Spade having to face the disagreeable consequences of his actions. </p> <p>When Hammett sent Blanche Knopf The Maltese Falcon, both she and Harry Block, the editor assigned to Hammett's work, wanted him to tone down the novel's sexuality. They feared that not only the sex scenes between Spade and Brigid, but also the overt homosexual references to the life of Falcon-hunter Joel Cairo would offend readers. Hammett insisted that those passages remain; indeed, they help give the story its essential character. </p> <p>The Maltese Falcon is an intensely physical novel, and not solely, or even chiefly, because of its sexuality. In contrast to some of Hammett's earlier work, especially Red Harvest, there's not a lot of violent action. In The Maltese Falcon, there are a couple of onstage murders, one scene where Sam is drugged and kicked in the head, and a fight between O'Shaughnessy and Cairo, but none of these scenes has the kind of graphic, numbing violence of Red Harvest. The Maltese Falcon's physicality lies rather in the intensity of the characters' struggles with their emotions, and the vividness with which Hammett brings their personalities to the page through their bodies. </p> <p>The book opens with a description of Spade's long bony jaw, his yellow-grey eyes, his V-shaped nostrils. In every encounter that Sam has, whether with Brigid or \"the fat man\", another Falcon-hunter, or the police, we see his body acting and reacting: his eyes hold \"an almost exaggerated amount of candour\" when talking to the police, then they become \"dull, almost dead\". When the lieutenant hits him \"his thick sloping shoulders\" writhe under his coat. The effort not to hit back puts deep creases between his brows: </p> <p> His nostrils moved in and out with his breathing _Red rage came suddenly into his face and he began to talk in a harsh guttural voice. Holding his maddened face in his hands, glaring at the floor, he cursed Dundy for five minutes without break... </p> <p>The final scene with Brigid goes on for pages as Sam's eyes become bloodshot, his voice turns to a croak, and sweat pours from his body with the intensity of his struggle. Again and again Brigid tries to persuade him of her love for him, his for her, and why he should let her go; finally: </p> <p> Spade pulled his hand out of hers. He no longer either smiled or grimaced. His wet yellow face was set hard and deeply lined. His eyes burned madly. He said, \"Listen. This isn't a damned bit of good. You'll never understand me, but I'll try once more and then we'll give it up.\" </p> <p>Of course, Brigid can't understand, partly because she's the murderer, and partly because, unlike Sam who is both body and mind, she exists only in the body. When the cops show up a few minutes later to arrest her, he pushes her forward into their arms, then discusses Falcon-seekers \"the fat man\" Caspar Gutman, and Joel Cairo for some minutes without any further mention of the woman. There's no description of her as she leaves, no word of Sam looking at her or thinking about her. </p> <p>Whether Spade and Brigid represent Hammett's own views of men and women is a question for psychological biographers to grapple with. When he became famous, he did leave his wife Jose, to whom he dedicated The Maltese Falcon, and their two daughters with no more of a backward glance than Spade gives Brigid. In fact, after 1940, he didn't see his daughters for over a decade. While he left each daughter a share in his estate, he didn't help support them during their growing up. </p> <p>Hammett's own problematic relations with women included the uncontested rape charge brought by the actress Elise de Vianne, but as it was a civil charge, Hammett paid damages without undergoing criminal prosecution. While Hammett and Lillian Hellman had a relationship that lasted until his death, it was interrupted not just by the second world war, but by Hammett's financial and alcohol problems. Hammett and Hellman were estranged for five or six years after the war. He did begin working with Hellman on some of her own writing in the early 50s, but they never lived together again. Perhaps, as he had described Spade, he was that \"hard and shifty fellow, able to get the best of anybody he comes in contact with\". </p> <p>Hammett's work influenced every crime writer who came after him, from Raymond Chandler on. Even Chandler's famous essay, The Simple Art of Murder, the one that explains that Hammett took murder out of the drawing room and put it back in the alleys where it belonged, and includes the celebrated phrase, \"Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself afraid, who is neither tarnished nor afraid,\" derives from book reviews Hammett wrote in the 20s, and the Continental Op stories. </p> <p>When he created the Continental Op, the detective about whom he wrote 26 short stories and four novellas, as well as Red Harvest, Hammett was trying to do two things. The first, frankly, was to make a living, and to do so in a way that would show his relatives back in Baltimore that he had amounted to something. He had two small daughters and a wife, and was too ill to work, but he took a vocational training course in typing and writing and began to do both ad copy and short stories. He sold his first fiction to a poorly-paying magazine run by HL Mencken, another Baltimore man, chiefly so that his family back east would see that he had become a literary figure. </p> <p>Hammett was a self-taught writer who was able to analyse his own shortcomings, as well as to respond to criticism from magazine editors. He improved rapidly, cutting florid curlicues from his style, experimenting with different forms and genres before he settled exclusively on crime fiction. His health also improved. From 1923-25, he was writing stories at the rate of two or three a month and reviewing books for several weekly magazines, including the Saturday Review. </p> <p>Even with this kind of output, he couldn't make enough of a living, so in 1926 he left the Continental Op to go into advertising. After only a few months of making good money, his health broke down completely (a client found him collapsed in a pool of blood from his tubercular lung). As he convalesced he began combining four Op novellas into the novel Red Harvest. </p> <p>Initially he chose to write detec tive fiction not just because there was a large pulp magazine market in the 20s where he could sell his pieces, but also because he felt strongly about the way in which the British puzzle mystery distorted the realities of the detective world. His Continental Op changed that. The Op (who is never named) also gave Hammett the chance to write newspaper and magazine reviews where he spelled out his views clearly. He wanted a detective story that reflected human emotion; he was scornful of S S Van Dine and other American writers who aped the passionless, closed-room mysteries of Agatha Christie or John Dickson Carr. He wrote scathing reviews of crime writers who made no attempt to get details of detection and death correct. Hammett said of the Op that he was \"the private detective who oftenest is success ful: neither the derby-hatted and broad-toed blockhead of one school of fiction, nor the all-knowing, infallible genius of another\". </p> <p>Hammett didn't create the hard-boiled detective, but he created the creature that everyone else imitates: the man who exposes himself not just to danger, but to police mistrust, who operates not with the remote little grey cells of Hercule Poirot, but with a passionate engagement with the world, a loner whose triumphs are always tinged with loss. </p> <p>My own work is strongly influenced by Hammett. My detective, VI Warshawski, operates in that world of passionate engagement. VI exhibits the trait which Spade made the hallmark of all subsequent literary private investigators: the understanding of human motivations which makes it possible to sort out a crime. It's not forensic evidence that tells Spade that Brigid killed his partner, but his knowledge of Miles Archer: only a seductive woman could have lured him into an alley and shot him at point-blank range. </p> <p>In another way, my work developed as a direct reaction to Hammett and the noir form he helped perfect. The character of Brigid O'Shaughnessy recurs so relentlessly in western fiction that we accept her as part of the landscape: she shows up as Fiona Shaw in Tom Topor's Coda; as Dolores, who \"reeks of sex\", in Chandler's The Little Sister; as Vixi in Josef Skvorecky's critically acclaimed Miracle Game. In this novel about the Prague spring of 1968, it turns out that the corruption in the Czech government and the crushing of the velvet revolution were due to the duplicity of a highly-sexed female student, a vixen who worked for the secret police, had sex with her professors and colleagues, and then betrayed them all. Brigid O'Shaughnessy is also a vixen: she has red fox-like hair and \"little sharp animal teeth\". </p> <p>In creating my own detective, I wanted a rebuttal of Brigid O'Shaughnessy. I wanted a woman who could, like Sam Spade, be a physical, sexual person without being evil. In a funny way, if Sam Spade had never existed, neither would VI Warshawski. The same could probably be said for most contemporary detectives. Whether we write in imitation or reaction to Spade's world, we are all in one way or another standing in his shadow. </p> <p>After The Maltese Falcon, Hammett wrote only two more novels, The Glass Key and The Thin Man. Throughout the 30s and into the 40s, he made a good living writing radio plays about the detectives in The Thin Man, Nick and Nora Charles, but his drinking and his other problems made it impossible for him to finish any book projects. He helped shape the Screenwriters Guild and was active politically, but he had lost his nerve when it came to fiction. He tried a few Sam Spade short stories, but this best-known of all private eyes really exists only in this one novel. </p> <p>By the 50s, Hammett was bankrupt; when he got out of prison, his lung problems had become acute again.

      "bodyText": "'After reading The Maltese Falcon, I went mooning about in a daze of love such as I had not known for any character in literature since I encountered Sir Launcelot,\" Dorothy Parker wrote in the New Yorker in 1931, adding that she had read the book 30 or 40 times in the two years after its publication. The cynical journalist wasn't the only woman felled by Spade, or his creator: dozens went to bed with Dashiell Hammett when he moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles to join the throng trying to make money in Hollywood. Lillian Hellman even left her husband in Los Angeles to follow Hammett to New York in 1931. Sam Spade made Hammett famous and, for a short time, rich. The man who had been unable to feed his family a few years before started getting $2,000 a week from Paramount to come up with original story lines. Hammett threw the money away on his idea of the high life: lavish parties that cost as much as $10,000; long weekends of drinking with starlets and writers in California; and some of it on settling a claim of forcible rape by a young actress. Everyone who reads Hammett seems to read their own needs into his work: where Dorothy Parker found Sir Launcelot, Senator Joe McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee saw communism. Hammett spent six months in a federal prison in 1951 when he refused to testify to Congress about the Civil Rights Congress, an organisation on whose board he sat which provided bail to communists. A few years after leaving prison, Hammett was back in front of Congress, this time before McCarthy's committee. The senator believed Hammett could only have named his first novel Red Harvest because he was a red himself. (While it's true that, in the 30s and 40s, Hammett openly supported the Communist party, publisher Blanche Knopf actually named Red Harvest, as she thought Hammett's original title, Poisonville, would put readers off.) McCarthy even went so far as to remove copies of Hammett's novels from all American embassies so that State Department employees wouldn't be exposed to his communist writings. When Hammett died in 1961, a veteran of the first and second world wars as well as the McCarthy era blacklist, the FBI tried to stop his burial in Arlington. Other readers have seen equally unusual landscapes in Hammett's work. One recent critic says The Maltese Falcon is an elaborate allegory about American foreign policy in the decade following the first world war, with the seductive sexuality of Brigid O'Shaughnessy representing the European seductions that drew America into the war, and the death of Spade's partner representing the useless deaths that war brings in its wake. Modernist critics claim Hammett was making a serious critique of the automobile; neo-Marxists share Senator McCarthy's view that the work was thoroughly red, albeit with admiration. Hammett seemed to see his own face when he looked at Sam Spade. Aside from the fact that his own first name was Samuel (his mother called him by his middle name, Dashiell, to distinguish him from three other Samuels in the family) Hammett, too, had been a Pinkerton detective. In 1907, when he was 13, Hammett had to leave school to help support his family, but until he joined Pinkertons in 1915, he didn't stay at any job for more than a few months. When America entered the war, he joined the army as an ambulance driver, and in 1918, he contracted the flu in the terrible epidemic sweeping through army camps. His lungs were damaged so severely that for years he often didn't have the strength to get out of bed. He lived on a meagre disability check; his post-war Pinkerton stint only totalled four or five months, when he moved to the San Francisco area in search of a cure for his tubercular lungs. Although he exaggerated his role, and even his presence, in some of the agency's high-profile cases, he did have a first-hand knowledge of crime and criminals that other noir writers didn't possess. In a 1934 introduction to The Maltese Falcon, Hammett wrote: \"Spade had no original... he is what most of the private detectives I worked with would like to have been and what quite a few in their cockier moments thought they approached. For your private detective does not want to be an erudite solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes manner; he wants to be a hard and shifty fellow, able to take care of himself in any situation, able to get the best of anybody he comes in contact with, whether criminal, innocent by-stander or client.\" Somehow, in putting his private fantasy of himself on to paper, Hammett created a landscape into which each reader, from Dorothy Parker to Joe McCarthy and beyond, could project their own image. So I feel my own idiosyncratic reading of The Maltese Falcon fits into a tradition of highly personal reactions to the novel. When I read it, I see neither communists nor automobiles, but a world of dangerous female sexuality which Hammett found so terrifying that he needed to destroy it. There are three major women in the book: Iva Archer, a 30-something blonde of ripe sexual charms, married to Sam's partner Miles but having an affair with Sam; Effie Perine, who is Sam's secretary; and Brigid O'Shaughnessy, the client who sets the wheels of the story in motion. Effie, a boyish and guileless young woman, opens the story by ushering in Brigid, who is soft, stylish and appears touchingly shy and vulnerable. Effie knows Sam will want to see Brigid, because \"she's a knockout\". From the start, then, we know that Sam is a sexual being, and it becomes clear pretty soon that Brigid is as well. Brigid gives Sam an assumed name and an assumed story about a sister involved with a dangerous gangster. From that moment on we're involved in a deception of her making, which only Sam can see through and cut through. She kills his partner, gets Sam to do her dirty work in looking for the Falcon, so that she can double-cross her accomplices and then, at the end, tries to seduce Sam, so that she can get off the hook. Sam \"sends her over\" anyway, but only after an emotional struggle which causes the sweat to pour down his face. Brigid O'Shaughnessy is part of a traditional way of describing women in western culture, starting with Eve, who ruins paradise for Adam, and moving on to such contemporary characters as Alex Forrest in the movie Fatal Attraction. O'Shaughnessy is the first significant modern temptress, the first to appear after the first world war when women could vote, cut off their hair, cast off the 12 pounds of heavy clothes they wore in Victorian times and move freely in society. Like Eve, O'Shaughnessy uses her body to try to make the hero do bad things, but unlike Adam, Sam is too strong for the temptress. As a foil to O'Shaughnessy is Sam's secretary, Effie Perine. Sam never calls her Effie, though: she is sweetheart, darling, sister, and, especially angel. And Effie is an angel. In contrast to Brigid's sultry sensuality, Effie's \"eyes were brown and playful in a shiny boyish face\". The fact that she is boyish in her looks means that she is not a sexual, and therefore predatory, female. Sam can trust her, but her boyishness also makes her naive. She believes in Brigid: she tells Sam that, despite the two phoney identities the client has used: \"I'm for her. I don't care if she has all the names in the phone book. That girl is all right and you know it.\" At the end of the book, she cannot accept the fact that Sam sent Brigid over. Women work on intuition, as Sam tells her off and on throughout the novel, but a man has to deal in justice. \"So much for your woman's intuition,\"[Sam said]... [Effie's] voice was queer as the expression on her face. \"You did that, Sam, to her?\" He nodded. \"Your Sam's a detective.\" He looked sharply at her. He put his arm around her waist, his hand on her hip.\"She did kill Miles, angel,\" he said gently, \"offhand, like that.\" He snapped the fingers of his other hand. She escaped from his arm as if it had hurt her. \"Don't, please, don't touch me,\" she said brokenly. \"I know - I know you're right. You're right. But don't touch me now - not now.\" Still, Hammett recognises that Sam is not an innocent himself: he's been sleeping with Iva Archer, who is a blowsier, less sophisticated sexual animal than Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Right after the scene with Effie, Iva arrives. Effie returns to Sam's office to tell him that Iva is waiting. Spade, looking down at his desk, nodded almost imperceptibly. \"Yes,\" he said, and shivered. \"Well, send her in.\" The novel ends on this sombre note, with Sam Spade having to face the disagreeable consequences of his actions. When Hammett sent Blanche Knopf The Maltese Falcon, both she and Harry Block, the editor assigned to Hammett's work, wanted him to tone down the novel's sexuality. They feared that not only the sex scenes between Spade and Brigid, but also the overt homosexual references to the life of Falcon-hunter Joel Cairo would offend readers. Hammett insisted that those passages remain; indeed, they help give the story its essential character. The Maltese Falcon is an intensely physical novel, and not solely, or even chiefly, because of its sexuality. In contrast to some of Hammett's earlier work, especially Red Harvest, there's not a lot of violent action. In The Maltese Falcon, there are a couple of onstage murders, one scene where Sam is drugged and kicked in the head, and a fight between O'Shaughnessy and Cairo, but none of these scenes has the kind of graphic, numbing violence of Red Harvest. The Maltese Falcon's physicality lies rather in the intensity of the characters' struggles with their emotions, and the vividness with which Hammett brings their personalities to the page through their bodies. The book opens with a description of Spade's long bony jaw, his yellow-grey eyes, his V-shaped nostrils. In every encounter that Sam has, whether with Brigid or \"the fat man\", another Falcon-hunter, or the police, we see his body acting and reacting: his eyes hold \"an almost exaggerated amount of candour\" when talking to the police, then they become \"dull, almost dead\". When the lieutenant hits him \"his thick sloping shoulders\" writhe under his coat. The effort not to hit back puts deep creases between his brows: His nostrils moved in and out with his breathing _Red rage came suddenly into his face and he began to talk in a harsh guttural voice. Holding his maddened face in his hands, glaring at the floor, he cursed Dundy for five minutes without break... The final scene with Brigid goes on for pages as Sam's eyes become bloodshot, his voice turns to a croak, and sweat pours from his body with the intensity of his struggle. Again and again Brigid tries to persuade him of her love for him, his for her, and why he should let her go; finally: Spade pulled his hand out of hers. He no longer either smiled or grimaced. His wet yellow face was set hard and deeply lined. His eyes burned madly. He said, \"Listen. This isn't a damned bit of good. You'll never understand me, but I'll try once more and then we'll give it up.\" Of course, Brigid can't understand, partly because she's the murderer, and partly because, unlike Sam who is both body and mind, she exists only in the body. When the cops show up a few minutes later to arrest her, he pushes her forward into their arms, then discusses Falcon-seekers \"the fat man\" Caspar Gutman, and Joel Cairo for some minutes without any further mention of the woman. There's no description of her as she leaves, no word of Sam looking at her or thinking about her. Whether Spade and Brigid represent Hammett's own views of men and women is a question for psychological biographers to grapple with. When he became famous, he did leave his wife Jose, to whom he dedicated The Maltese Falcon, and their two daughters with no more of a backward glance than Spade gives Brigid. In fact, after 1940, he didn't see his daughters for over a decade. While he left each daughter a share in his estate, he didn't help support them during their growing up. Hammett's own problematic relations with women included the uncontested rape charge brought by the actress Elise de Vianne, but as it was a civil charge, Hammett paid damages without undergoing criminal prosecution. While Hammett and Lillian Hellman had a relationship that lasted until his death, it was interrupted not just by the second world war, but by Hammett's financial and alcohol problems. Hammett and Hellman were estranged for five or six years after the war. He did begin working with Hellman on some of her own writing in the early 50s, but they never lived together again. Perhaps, as he had described Spade, he was that \"hard and shifty fellow, able to get the best of anybody he comes in contact with\". Hammett's work influenced every crime writer who came after him, from Raymond Chandler on. Even Chandler's famous essay, The Simple Art of Murder, the one that explains that Hammett took murder out of the drawing room and put it back in the alleys where it belonged, and includes the celebrated phrase, \"Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself afraid, who is neither tarnished nor afraid,\" derives from book reviews Hammett wrote in the 20s, and the Continental Op stories. When he created the Continental Op, the detective about whom he wrote 26 short stories and four novellas, as well as Red Harvest, Hammett was trying to do two things. The first, frankly, was to make a living, and to do so in a way that would show his relatives back in Baltimore that he had amounted to something. He had two small daughters and a wife, and was too ill to work, but he took a vocational training course in typing and writing and began to do both ad copy and short stories. He sold his first fiction to a poorly-paying magazine run by HL Mencken, another Baltimore man, chiefly so that his family back east would see that he had become a literary figure. Hammett was a self-taught writer who was able to analyse his own shortcomings, as well as to respond to criticism from magazine editors. He improved rapidly, cutting florid curlicues from his style, experimenting with different forms and genres before he settled exclusively on crime fiction. His health also improved. From 1923-25, he was writing stories at the rate of two or three a month and reviewing books for several weekly magazines, including the Saturday Review. Even with this kind of output, he couldn't make enough of a living, so in 1926 he left the Continental Op to go into advertising. After only a few months of making good money, his health broke down completely (a client found him collapsed in a pool of blood from his tubercular lung). As he convalesced he began combining four Op novellas into the novel Red Harvest. Initially he chose to write detec tive fiction not just because there was a large pulp magazine market in the 20s where he could sell his pieces, but also because he felt strongly about the way in which the British puzzle mystery distorted the realities of the detective world. His Continental Op changed that. The Op (who is never named) also gave Hammett the chance to write newspaper and magazine reviews where he spelled out his views clearly. He wanted a detective story that reflected human emotion; he was scornful of S S Van Dine and other American writers who aped the passionless, closed-room mysteries of Agatha Christie or John Dickson Carr. He wrote scathing reviews of crime writers who made no attempt to get details of detection and death correct. Hammett said of the Op that he was \"the private detective who oftenest is success ful: neither the derby-hatted and broad-toed blockhead of one school of fiction, nor the all-knowing, infallible genius of another\". Hammett didn't create the hard-boiled detective, but he created the creature that everyone else imitates: the man who exposes himself not just to danger, but to police mistrust, who operates not with the remote little grey cells of Hercule Poirot, but with a passionate engagement with the world, a loner whose triumphs are always tinged with loss. My own work is strongly influenced by Hammett. My detective, VI Warshawski, operates in that world of passionate engagement. VI exhibits the trait which Spade made the hallmark of all subsequent literary private investigators: the understanding of human motivations which makes it possible to sort out a crime. It's not forensic evidence that tells Spade that Brigid killed his partner, but his knowledge of Miles Archer: only a seductive woman could have lured him into an alley and shot him at point-blank range. In another way, my work developed as a direct reaction to Hammett and the noir form he helped perfect. The character of Brigid O'Shaughnessy recurs so relentlessly in western fiction that we accept her as part of the landscape: she shows up as Fiona Shaw in Tom Topor's Coda; as Dolores, who \"reeks of sex\", in Chandler's The Little Sister; as Vixi in Josef Skvorecky's critically acclaimed Miracle Game. In this novel about the Prague spring of 1968, it turns out that the corruption in the Czech government and the crushing of the velvet revolution were due to the duplicity of a highly-sexed female student, a vixen who worked for the secret police, had sex with her professors and colleagues, and then betrayed them all. Brigid O'Shaughnessy is also a vixen: she has red fox-like hair and \"little sharp animal teeth\". In creating my own detective, I wanted a rebuttal of Brigid O'Shaughnessy. I wanted a woman who could, like Sam Spade, be a physical, sexual person without being evil. In a funny way, if Sam Spade had never existed, neither would VI Warshawski. The same could probably be said for most contemporary detectives. Whether we write in imitation or reaction to Spade's world, we are all in one way or another standing in his shadow. After The Maltese Falcon, Hammett wrote only two more novels, The Glass Key and The Thin Man. Throughout the 30s and into the 40s, he made a good living writing radio plays about the detectives in The Thin Man, Nick and Nora Charles, but his drinking and his other problems made it impossible for him to finish any book projects. He helped shape the Screenwriters Guild and was active politically, but he had lost his nerve when it came to fiction. He tried a few Sam Spade short stories, but this best-known of all private eyes really exists only in this one novel. By the 50s, Hammett was bankrupt; when he got out of prison, his lung problems had become acute again. Unable to work, his novels blacklisted, he lived the rest of his life in a cottage on the estate of a sympathetic doctor in New York. He died of lung cancer in 1961 under a cloud of debt. Except for the 50s, when publishers were terrified of doing business with a blacklisted writer, The Maltese Falcon has never been out of print in the 70 years since its publication. At least 15 movies have been made about one aspect or another of the novel. The most famous is the Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor movie, which made director John Huston's reputation, turned Bogart from a film heavy into a hero, and brought Sam Spade to hundreds of millions of people around the world. Spade may not be Sir Launcelot; he's definitely not a communist; but he is an enduring part of the American literary landscape. \u0095 This is an edited extract from Sara Paretsky's introduction to The Maltese Falcon, published by The Folio Society with illustrations by David Eccles, price \u00a317.95.

      "body": "<p>A hush will descend over the aisles today as the phial is held up above the altar of Santa Chiara cathedral. The blood of a saint beheaded in AD305 will almost certainly liquefy. And Naples will have its annual miracle. Shouts and cheers will break out in the cathedral and spread across the waiting city, because if the blood does not liquefy, disaster will strike: an earthquake or an eruption from Mount Vesuvius. </p> <p>San Gennaro was martyred at Pozzuoli, just outside Naples, under the purges of Diocletian. Christians preserved his blood in a phial and made him the city's patron saint. The phial, trimmed with gold, is kept in a chapel beside the cathedral. Twice a year, it is carried in procession to the altar. Armed police, television crews and thousands of Neapolitans pack inside. There is a Mass, the phial is held aloft, cries of \"Viva San Gennaro!\" resound, then it is lowered and the cardinal peers at what minutes before was solid powder. </p> <p>There is no reason why it should liquefy. But it does. For 600 years it has done so, every first Saturday in May and on September 19, the saint's feast day. The phial will be shaken by the cardinal archbishop Michele Giordano, whom local magistrates have demanded be sent for trial on charges of loansharking and misappropriating church funds. The congregation will queue for a week to kiss the relic. Occasionally the blood has remained solid. It did in 1944; Mount Vesuvius erupted. It did in 1980; there was an earthquake. </p> <p>The hunger for miracles, those inexplicable occurrences that seem to defy the laws of nature and bear witness to an omnipotent force - spreads far beyond Italy. An ugly village in France attracts more visitors than Egypt because of six crutches hanging on a rusty wire, symbol of a miracle cure for those who join the pilgrimage to Lourdes. And 7m people a year trek to the remote Italian village of San Giovanni Rotondo to visit the grave of Padre Pio, a priest who apparently received the stigmata, cured the sick and was in two places at once. </p> <p>Church attendances are plummeting but the sites of Christian pilgrimage are booming. Time magazine's poll says 69% of Americans believe in miracles. Charismatic and Pentecostal congregations, where worship revolves around signs and wonders, have swollen in Britain. Pope John Paul II scours the Catholic world for miracles he can attribute to the scores of people he wants to beatify (at least two miracles are needed for sainthood). Next Saturday, at Portugal's Fatima shrine, he will beatify two children whose visions of the Virgin Mary in 1917 he credits with saving his life when he was shot in 1981, on the anniversary of the first apparition. </p> <p>Two thousand years after a Galileean carpenter is said to have walked on water and risen from the dead, despite the growth of scientific knowledge and our understanding of the natural world, many Christians still believe in supernatural occurrences. The Catholic Church is adamant that miracles are not superstition, they are facts produced by the intervention of God that transcend the normal order of things. </p> <p>For David Hume, the enlightenment philosopher, miracles were violations of natural laws by supernatural agents. In the 1890s, Emile Zola reckoned they represented boredom and hunger for illusion. \"I don't believe in miracles but I do believe in the human need to believe in miracles.\" </p> <p>It's a continuing need. A weeping Madonna statue in Rincon, Puerto Rico, transforms villagers' lives. A retired postmistress and her daughter in Wicklow, Ireland, host thousands of visitors after their Madonna weeps blood and radiates peace. A priest in Virginia, US, causes statues to cry and has stigmata on his wrists and feet. Franciscan nuns in Benin reel when their convent statue weeps;100 people in Britain receive golden fillings while praying; a Mexican chef sees Jesus in a tortilla. </p> <p>On an overcast morning, a coach pulls up at the entrance to San Augostino, a secluded church in Civitavecchia, a depressed port 50 miles north of Rome. Elderly and middle-aged pilgrims clamber out and bless themselves. They are here for a miracle. Greeting them is a life-sized replica of the parish's weeping Madonna, the most famous in Italy. Four stalls, with church permission, sell books and trinkets: keyrings, figurines blotched with red paint around the eyes, Padre Pio cigarette lighters. </p> <p>\"Before all this started I sold bags and hats,\" said Vittorio Sorbo. Does he believe in the miracle? He looks hurt. \"Of course. If I didn't I wouldn't be allowed to have a stall here.\" Civitavecchia's miracle is 14 inches high and was bought for \u00a36 from a stall in Bosnia six years ago by the parish priest, Don Pablo, and given as a present to an electrician, Fabio Gregori, who put it in his garden. </p> <p>On February 2, 1995, Fabio's daughter Jessica, 5, saw two tears of blood roll down the statue's face. She called her father, who called Don Pablo, who called Bishop Girolamo Grillo, who called it a miracle. \"It wept in my hands,\" he said. Before more than 50 witnesses, including communist unbelievers, it cried 14 times over 40 days. The blood was examined at a Rome laboratory and found to be male. \"Christ's, it must be Christ's,\" said the bishop. </p> <p> The statue was placed behind bullet-proof glass in an alcove inside the church. The blood is faded and invisible now, but photographs on the walls show how it was. Those who visit are said to leave converted, healed, or inspired. \"Thousands and thousands come,\" smiled Don Pablo, watching the latest arrivals. Among them is Clara Ancheta, 63, who has cancer. \"I've come to pray for my operations.\" Forty minutes later she emerges, supported by her husband, smiling. \"The Madonna is beautiful. She has given me hope. I feel stronger.\" </p> <p>Luigi Garlaschelli, a chemist at the University of Pavia, says the statue is a crude fraud. A member of the Italian Committee for Investigation of the Paranormal (Cicap), he has come across many different fakes: statues filled with a red liquid, and covered in glaze which can be slit with a fingernail; statues containing a pump, operated by remote control; statues coated with an acetone liquid activated when exposed to ammonia. </p> <p>Civitavecchia's statue is solid plaster, and the stains are real blood, but there is a simple explanation, he says. Someone pricked a finger and smeared their own blood. Photographs of the stains taken at the beginning and end of the 14 weepings are identical. \"An initial trick, followed by mass self-delusion, seems very likely.\" </p> <p>A professional illusionist, Alfredo Barrago, sneaked into the church gallery and aimed a red laser beam at the statue's eyes, creating the appearance of weeping. A worshipper fainted and Barrago claimed vindication. \"It's nonsense,\" he said. DNA tests showed the blood to be of a Mediterranean male with anaemia. The male members of the Gregori family agreed to be DNA tested, then reneged, saying they would do so only if asked by Bishop Grillo, who declined. By law they cannot be compelled. </p> <p>Fabio Gregori's voice quavers when he answers the phone. No, he will not meet me, too many lies are being said about him and what really happened in his garden. \"This is causing me much suffering, I cannot endure it.\" </p> <p>Business is slackening, but the Civitavecchia statue remains the most popular of Italy's weeping Madonnas. The newspaper Corriere della Sera noted that maybe a depressed port with high unemployment thought there was no other way to make money. </p> <p>Garlaschelli's analyses of more than 70 \"miracles\" have been published in scientific journals and in an imminent book, Investigators of the Occult. He has been accused of plotting to destroy faith. But a more measured official reaction comes from the Church. \"It is very, very cautious,\" he says. Since 1830, the Vatican has approved a mere 15 apparitions of the Virgin Mary and just one weeping Madonna, in Sicily in 1954. It has yet to rule on Civitavecchia. Past experience suggests Bishop Grillo will be in his grave before the outcome is known. In 1974, the Vatican issued new guidelines distinguishing between the miraculous - physical acts without natural causes - and the supernatural, which is in the eye of the beholder. </p> <p>Miracles are a theological quagmire. \"Why does this generation ask for a sign?\" asked Jesus, angry at the requests. He recognised that flashes of divine intervention bolstered faith, but that they dispelled all doubt about God's existence. Then there would be no need for faith. \"Yet if we don't have miracles then what is the point in praying? That would be a God on permanent sabbatical leave who doesn't do anything for us,\" says Gerald O'Connor, a theologian at Rome's Gregorian University. </p> <p> Sociologists and psychologists tend to explain away miracles as mass hysteria in societies experiencing upheaval or anxiety. Ireland's moving statues of the 80s, at a time of political and economic stress, were perfect examples.

      "bodyText": "A hush will descend over the aisles today as the phial is held up above the altar of Santa Chiara cathedral. The blood of a saint beheaded in AD305 will almost certainly liquefy. And Naples will have its annual miracle. Shouts and cheers will break out in the cathedral and spread across the waiting city, because if the blood does not liquefy, disaster will strike: an earthquake or an eruption from Mount Vesuvius. San Gennaro was martyred at Pozzuoli, just outside Naples, under the purges of Diocletian. Christians preserved his blood in a phial and made him the city's patron saint. The phial, trimmed with gold, is kept in a chapel beside the cathedral. Twice a year, it is carried in procession to the altar. Armed police, television crews and thousands of Neapolitans pack inside. There is a Mass, the phial is held aloft, cries of \"Viva San Gennaro!\" resound, then it is lowered and the cardinal peers at what minutes before was solid powder. There is no reason why it should liquefy. But it does. For 600 years it has done so, every first Saturday in May and on September 19, the saint's feast day. The phial will be shaken by the cardinal archbishop Michele Giordano, whom local magistrates have demanded be sent for trial on charges of loansharking and misappropriating church funds. The congregation will queue for a week to kiss the relic. Occasionally the blood has remained solid. It did in 1944; Mount Vesuvius erupted. It did in 1980; there was an earthquake. The hunger for miracles, those inexplicable occurrences that seem to defy the laws of nature and bear witness to an omnipotent force - spreads far beyond Italy. An ugly village in France attracts more visitors than Egypt because of six crutches hanging on a rusty wire, symbol of a miracle cure for those who join the pilgrimage to Lourdes. And 7m people a year trek to the remote Italian village of San Giovanni Rotondo to visit the grave of Padre Pio, a priest who apparently received the stigmata, cured the sick and was in two places at once. Church attendances are plummeting but the sites of Christian pilgrimage are booming. Time magazine's poll says 69% of Americans believe in miracles. Charismatic and Pentecostal congregations, where worship revolves around signs and wonders, have swollen in Britain. Pope John Paul II scours the Catholic world for miracles he can attribute to the scores of people he wants to beatify (at least two miracles are needed for sainthood). Next Saturday, at Portugal's Fatima shrine, he will beatify two children whose visions of the Virgin Mary in 1917 he credits with saving his life when he was shot in 1981, on the anniversary of the first apparition. Two thousand years after a Galileean carpenter is said to have walked on water and risen from the dead, despite the growth of scientific knowledge and our understanding of the natural world, many Christians still believe in supernatural occurrences. The Catholic Church is adamant that miracles are not superstition, they are facts produced by the intervention of God that transcend the normal order of things. For David Hume, the enlightenment philosopher, miracles were violations of natural laws by supernatural agents. In the 1890s, Emile Zola reckoned they represented boredom and hunger for illusion. \"I don't believe in miracles but I do believe in the human need to believe in miracles.\" It's a continuing need. A weeping Madonna statue in Rincon, Puerto Rico, transforms villagers' lives. A retired postmistress and her daughter in Wicklow, Ireland, host thousands of visitors after their Madonna weeps blood and radiates peace. A priest in Virginia, US, causes statues to cry and has stigmata on his wrists and feet. Franciscan nuns in Benin reel when their convent statue weeps;100 people in Britain receive golden fillings while praying; a Mexican chef sees Jesus in a tortilla. On an overcast morning, a coach pulls up at the entrance to San Augostino, a secluded church in Civitavecchia, a depressed port 50 miles north of Rome. Elderly and middle-aged pilgrims clamber out and bless themselves. They are here for a miracle. Greeting them is a life-sized replica of the parish's weeping Madonna, the most famous in Italy. Four stalls, with church permission, sell books and trinkets: keyrings, figurines blotched with red paint around the eyes, Padre Pio cigarette lighters. \"Before all this started I sold bags and hats,\" said Vittorio Sorbo. Does he believe in the miracle? He looks hurt. \"Of course. If I didn't I wouldn't be allowed to have a stall here.\" Civitavecchia's miracle is 14 inches high and was bought for \u00a36 from a stall in Bosnia six years ago by the parish priest, Don Pablo, and given as a present to an electrician, Fabio Gregori, who put it in his garden. On February 2, 1995, Fabio's daughter Jessica, 5, saw two tears of blood roll down the statue's face. She called her father, who called Don Pablo, who called Bishop Girolamo Grillo, who called it a miracle. \"It wept in my hands,\" he said. Before more than 50 witnesses, including communist unbelievers, it cried 14 times over 40 days. The blood was examined at a Rome laboratory and found to be male. \"Christ's, it must be Christ's,\" said the bishop. The statue was placed behind bullet-proof glass in an alcove inside the church. The blood is faded and invisible now, but photographs on the walls show how it was. Those who visit are said to leave converted, healed, or inspired. \"Thousands and thousands come,\" smiled Don Pablo, watching the latest arrivals. Among them is Clara Ancheta, 63, who has cancer. \"I've come to pray for my operations.\" Forty minutes later she emerges, supported by her husband, smiling. \"The Madonna is beautiful. She has given me hope. I feel stronger.\" Luigi Garlaschelli, a chemist at the University of Pavia, says the statue is a crude fraud. A member of the Italian Committee for Investigation of the Paranormal (Cicap), he has come across many different fakes: statues filled with a red liquid, and covered in glaze which can be slit with a fingernail; statues containing a pump, operated by remote control; statues coated with an acetone liquid activated when exposed to ammonia. Civitavecchia's statue is solid plaster, and the stains are real blood, but there is a simple explanation, he says. Someone pricked a finger and smeared their own blood. Photographs of the stains taken at the beginning and end of the 14 weepings are identical. \"An initial trick, followed by mass self-delusion, seems very likely.\" A professional illusionist, Alfredo Barrago, sneaked into the church gallery and aimed a red laser beam at the statue's eyes, creating the appearance of weeping. A worshipper fainted and Barrago claimed vindication. \"It's nonsense,\" he said. DNA tests showed the blood to be of a Mediterranean male with anaemia. The male members of the Gregori family agreed to be DNA tested, then reneged, saying they would do so only if asked by Bishop Grillo, who declined. By law they cannot be compelled. Fabio Gregori's voice quavers when he answers the phone. No, he will not meet me, too many lies are being said about him and what really happened in his garden. \"This is causing me much suffering, I cannot endure it.\" Business is slackening, but the Civitavecchia statue remains the most popular of Italy's weeping Madonnas. The newspaper Corriere della Sera noted that maybe a depressed port with high unemployment thought there was no other way to make money. Garlaschelli's analyses of more than 70 \"miracles\" have been published in scientific journals and in an imminent book, Investigators of the Occult. He has been accused of plotting to destroy faith. But a more measured official reaction comes from the Church. \"It is very, very cautious,\" he says. Since 1830, the Vatican has approved a mere 15 apparitions of the Virgin Mary and just one weeping Madonna, in Sicily in 1954. It has yet to rule on Civitavecchia. Past experience suggests Bishop Grillo will be in his grave before the outcome is known. In 1974, the Vatican issued new guidelines distinguishing between the miraculous - physical acts without natural causes - and the supernatural, which is in the eye of the beholder. Miracles are a theological quagmire. \"Why does this generation ask for a sign?\" asked Jesus, angry at the requests. He recognised that flashes of divine intervention bolstered faith, but that they dispelled all doubt about God's existence. Then there would be no need for faith. \"Yet if we don't have miracles then what is the point in praying? That would be a God on permanent sabbatical leave who doesn't do anything for us,\" says Gerald O'Connor, a theologian at Rome's Gregorian University. Sociologists and psychologists tend to explain away miracles as mass hysteria in societies experiencing upheaval or anxiety. Ireland's moving statues of the 80s, at a time of political and economic stress, were perfect examples. Devotion to shrines and sightings of the Virgin are relatively modern phenomena, said Canon Martyn Percy, who teaches theology at Sheffield. \"The higher you go up the evolutionary scale of Christianity, the less likely you are to be interested in miracles.\" A new generation of Bible scholars are re-interpreting Christ's miracles as metaphors. Even the Resurrection, the ultimate miracle of Christianity, was not a physical act, they say. Christ was resurrected in the lives and influence of his followers, not in a reconstituted body.

But here only around one in three is caught in the self-assessment net. These tend to be more complicated than average - but only about half of the estimated 9m who have to file the returns use an accountant to help them.</p> <p>From this tax year, self-assessment taxpayers who file their returns over the internet and pay any tax due electronically are able to receive a \u00a310 discount as an incentive to embrace internet technology.</p> <p>But users who employ tax advisers to complete and submit their returns will miss out. At present the incentive is only available to taxpayers who file in person and not their agents.</p> <p>Those who really go tax DIY may find that using the net to their returns is a sensible development. It's all part of a wider government plan which eventually will offer all services online.</p> <p>Foremost is the Inland Revenue's own self-assessment web site <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/e-tax/index.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/e-tax/index.htm</a>. The site provides free software for the most frequently used parts of the self-assessment tax return. And when you have submitted your return, the Revenue promises you instant acknowledgement of its receipt.</p> <p>The Revenue's system is straightforward and seems to work. Users can capture information about discounts for filing returns electronically, view a list of vendors providing compatible software for completing them, and then file the returns themselves.</p> <p>It is not just the Inland Revenue which offers online tax calculation packages.

Plus an online tax check-up where you can input your details to see if the taxman is taking more than his fair share of your income.</p> <p>The facility to file a tax return will be added in the summer. Inland Revenue forms are available to download or can be edited online.</p> <p>Another site offering a good tax calculator is Virtually Anywhere (<a href=\"http://www.virtuallyanywhere.co.uk/detax.html\" target=\"_NEW\">www.virtuallyanywhere.co.uk/detax.html</a> ) which also gives standard tax information along with links and contact details for tax advisers.</p> <p>But this site's strong point is its 'E-advise me' facility, which claims to offer personalised response to any tax related question from a team of experts who are all ex-Inland Revenue taxmen. Answers are later emailed to users.</p> <p>The advisers will discuss any tax issue you may have via email and on the telephone and, if appropriate, agree a service for individual needs. If necessary they will visit taxpayers at their homes. An initial contact and phone call is free but charging kicks in for fuller consultations.</p> <p>MoneyeXtra (<a href=\"http://www.moneyextra.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.moneyextra.com</a>) is another good site with headlines, tax calculators, tax guides, question and answer forums and links to local tax advisers.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Taxation, the professional body for tax advisers, offers limited information on its site (<a href=\"http://www.tax.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.tax.org.uk</a>).

      "bodyText": "In the USA using the internet to file tax returns is now commonplace - and new incentives in the UK suggest that dealing with with Hector the taxman in cyberspace may well take off this year. What's more there is a growing number of user-friendly sites which provide tax advice - and even give you the lowdown on tropical tax havens. \"Traditional tax preparation can be both time-consuming and intimidating, and each year we find more and more people turning to the net for tax preparation and filing,\" says Rob Shenk at AOL. In the US, all taxpayers have to make individual returns. But here only around one in three is caught in the self-assessment net. These tend to be more complicated than average - but only about half of the estimated 9m who have to file the returns use an accountant to help them. From this tax year, self-assessment taxpayers who file their returns over the internet and pay any tax due electronically are able to receive a \u00a310 discount as an incentive to embrace internet technology. But users who employ tax advisers to complete and submit their returns will miss out. At present the incentive is only available to taxpayers who file in person and not their agents. Those who really go tax DIY may find that using the net to their returns is a sensible development. It's all part of a wider government plan which eventually will offer all services online. Foremost is the Inland Revenue's own self-assessment web site www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/e-tax/index.htm. The site provides free software for the most frequently used parts of the self-assessment tax return. And when you have submitted your return, the Revenue promises you instant acknowledgement of its receipt. The Revenue's system is straightforward and seems to work. Users can capture information about discounts for filing returns electronically, view a list of vendors providing compatible software for completing them, and then file the returns themselves. It is not just the Inland Revenue which offers online tax calculation packages. Professionals are queuing up to offer their advice and services online. One of the best services is provided by tax advice web site Digita (www.digita.com) which has developed a new tax centre on the Freeserve web portal; find it at freeserve.digita.com. It has tax calculators, a daily tax news feed, a question and answer forum, and a search facility to find a tax adviser in your area. Plus an online tax check-up where you can input your details to see if the taxman is taking more than his fair share of your income. The facility to file a tax return will be added in the summer. Inland Revenue forms are available to download or can be edited online. Another site offering a good tax calculator is Virtually Anywhere (www.virtuallyanywhere.co.uk/detax.html ) which also gives standard tax information along with links and contact details for tax advisers. But this site's strong point is its 'E-advise me' facility, which claims to offer personalised response to any tax related question from a team of experts who are all ex-Inland Revenue taxmen. Answers are later emailed to users. The advisers will discuss any tax issue you may have via email and on the telephone and, if appropriate, agree a service for individual needs. If necessary they will visit taxpayers at their homes. An initial contact and phone call is free but charging kicks in for fuller consultations. MoneyeXtra (www.moneyextra.com) is another good site with headlines, tax calculators, tax guides, question and answer forums and links to local tax advisers. The Chartered Institute of Taxation, the professional body for tax advisers, offers limited information on its site (www.tax.org.uk). Although mainly dealing with how to find and contact its members, the site also gives some useful background to the tax system and explains self-assessment and taxpayers' obligations clearly and concisely. Taxpayers interested in offshore investment should explore www.lowtax.net. The site describes offshore investment and who uses it as well as offering a news service. Lowtax.net is an open site - there is no registration and no logging-in. It has sections for those interested in the tax charms of tropical dots on the map including Aruba, Monaco, Vanuatu and Costa Rica. Switzerland and Hong Kong will arrive shortly.",

I must say, what with two women each week in this country being killed by partners or ex-partners right now, I found this analysis offensive. There are few occasions when one even begins to understand what it must feel like to be a hated minority race in a country that recognises only the racially pure as having full civil rights, but reading, or hearing, the dismissal of domestic murder is definitely one of them. </p> <p>Every week we hear that a man killed his wife for no more substantial reason than her \"nagging\", or for smiling at another man, and each week some moronic bully gets off with a derisory sentence for such a crime. For any government to suggest that \"domestic\" murderers will in future be treated with mercy seems to me as irresponsible as telling racist killers that they will be looked upon kindly simply because they let their feelings of rage and loathing, their emotional incontinence, get the better of them. For that is what we are talking about here; emotional incontinence - certainly not \"passion\". </p> <p>Ah, passion! A rose between the teeth, a slap around the face, an adagio dance! Treat 'em mean and keep 'em keen! Like many stupid ideas about women, the crime passionel is French, and - like the also much-vaunted mistress/wife arrangement -was designed solely with the aim of making life easier for men at the expense of women. Are we truly to believe that such archaic notions have no connection with the chronic levels of sexual harassment and pornographic advertising that still exist in France, and which have created not a climate of enlightenment but one of bullying, hectoring oppression? Still, what can you expect from a country in which women didn't get the vote until 1945? </p> <p>Yes, there certainly wasn't much for women in all that liberty, equality and fraternity floating about after the French revolution, and ever since then the human and civil rights of women have remained a blind spot with men who should know better. The list of otherwise intelligent, radical men who have talked about women in a style somewhere between Hitler and Al Murray the Pub Landlord is always surprising. Solzenitsyn, writing with great disapproval of all the poor guys he found in the gulags imprisoned for \"trivial\" crimes such as rape; Stokely Carmichael, telling women that their place in the black revolution was \"prone\". </p> <p>Now, for your delectation, at London's Almeida Theatre, Tariq Ali, Howard Brenton and Andy de la Tour bring you Snogging Ken, a rigorous dissection of New Labour's blackguarding of the Livingstone mayoral campaign. And who's behind it? - Blair, Brown, Mandelson? Nah - women! A pair of \"Blair Babes\", as Andy de la Tour referred to them in a recent plug for the show. And what means do they use to bring the great man down? Typical woman's tricks - lying about sex. Treacherous bitches. </p> <p>Men's need to believe in female perfidy seems to be the last prejudice to die, and is all present and incorrect even in men who would run screaming if you accused them of any sort of bigotry. And what starts with the type of mentality that believes you can never trust a woman ends up in the treatment of domestic murder as less serious than \"real\" murder. And, with the exception of those cases where the perpetrator was in fear for his or her life, this reinforces the medieval message that when a woman sleeps with a man, she becomes his property and may be disposed of as he sees fit. </p> <p>Those who believe most strongly in the brotherhood of man often give the impression that, by its very nature, it excludes women. John Mortimer, that floridly humanitarian old ham, once said something along the lines of \"My life is so challenging because I'll be writing a play in the morning and defending a wife-murderer in the afternoon.\" He wouldn't have boasted about defending a race murderer, would he? Yet an average-size black man has far more chance of defending himself against an average-size white man than an average-size woman does. </p> <p>Around the time Mortimer said this, the actress Jane Asher was appearing in one of his TV series, and I was shocked to pick up the paper soon after and see that he was currently defending a man who had killed his wife because she danced with another man at a party - she was called Jane Asher, too. And it struck me then how symbolic this was: the famous, middle-class Jane Asher, free to go about her business without fear of male murderousness - whom John Mortimer knew, and referred to in glowing terms - and this unknown, working-class Jane Asher, killed by one of her own class only to have the cream of the legal elite rally around to defend a husband who did his level best to portray his wife as a strumpet. Mortimer, as a barrister, operates on the cab-rank principle. There are plenty of others who don't have that excuse. </p> <p>Surely the whole point of being a liberal is being able to empathise, to put yourself in the other man's shoes? Yet when it comes to the domestic murder of women by men, the killer's brogues always seem far more easy for the liberal to slip on than the stilettos of the victim. It's a puzzlement. </p> <p> With reference to my recent diatribe against those sad souls who hawk their wares in the bazaars of Thespus, I receive a letter from Emma Thompson, who is obviously a somewhat god-like being, despite the gallons of poison I have poured on her name in the past.

Many companies nowadays try to promote the idea that they exist principally to foster social cohesion and racial harmony. They want to make the world a happy place, but don't seem to care how they do it, whether by getting a gas company to sell electricity or by mending your car when it has broken down. They have probably got the idea from Tony Blair, whose popularity is mostly based on people thinking he is a nice, well-meaning person who will not deliberately let them down. What he actually does is less important. </p> <p>Luckily, among its many activities, the AA does still take care of motorists, and the arrival of its new card telling me that I have already been a member for 36 years reminds me of the days when motoring could still be rather fun. There were fewer cars, fewer speed limits, and a less hostile police. I can even remember a time when AA repairmen on their motorcycles would routinely salute any passing car that had the AA badge on its front bumper. Even today, receipt of my AA card makes me think about going for a spin in the car, just to see if it can still be pleasurable. And I am glad to report that it can. </p> <p>Last weekend, whilst in Northamptonshire, I went on a motoring expedition that was agreeably trouble-free, although it took me close to Silverstone, where at Easter many people got stuck in traffic jams for up to five hours because of a car-parking fiasco at the Grand Prix. Maybe this frightened the natives of Northamptonshire into staying at home this time. In any case, the weather was nice and the roads were clear.

It is also described as \"a perfect illustration of how a house should be shown to the public\". So, having never been there, I gave it a try. </p> <p> Well, Sulgrave Manor is a modest but nice enough place, built in the mid-1500s by Lawrence Washington, a Northampton wool merchant, whose great-great-grandson, Colonel John Washington, emigrated to Virginia in the 1650s and founded the dynasty that eventually produced George. It was bought by public subscription in 1914 to celebrate 100 years of peace between Britain and the United States, furnished with old furniture and Washington memorabilia, and endowed in perpetuity by the Colonial Dames of America. It is worth a brief visit, but the key word is \"brief\". </p> <p>The curse of so many country-house visits is the guided tour, which it is often impossible to avoid. After half-an-hour seated with half a dozen other elderly tourists in the Great Hall of Sulgrave, listening to a guide give a joke-heavy account of the house's fundamentally boring history, explain that bits of furniture are called things like cupboard or sideboard because they once contained cups or were situated at the side of the room, and try to be coy and skittish about Anglo-American relations, I was on the brink of suicide.

He said he is losing the will to live due to lack of sleep and the pain from his bedsores. His false teeth have not turned up, despite a top-level internal inquiry. He is living on soup and porridge - when somebody remembers to feed him. He is almost entirely helpless. </p> <p> Personally, I blame Tanya, his new wife, for his accident. My father is too old to be up a ladder trying to construct a Japanese-style pagoda under her exacting instructions.

He said he is losing the will to live due to lack of sleep and the pain from his bedsores. His false teeth have not turned up, despite a top-level internal inquiry. He is living on soup and porridge - when somebody remembers to feed him. He is almost entirely helpless. Personally, I blame Tanya, his new wife, for his accident. My father is too old to be up a ladder trying to construct a Japanese-style pagoda under her exacting instructions.

She has since become one of Capital Radio's most popular DJs and a TV presenter. Currently, she hosts Channel 4's T4 on Sunday mornings. She lives in Croydon with friends. What is your idea of perfect happiness? Lying on a golden beach under a blue sky, yards from a clear blue ocean. What is your greatest fear? That the people I care about don't know how much I care about them. With which historical figure do you most identify? I identify with the words of Martin Luther King, 'I have a dream' - everyone should have a dream. What objects do you always carry with you? My diary and a pencil. I don't like the new electronic diaries - give me pen and paper any day. What is your favourite smell? Freshly-cooked popcorn. What is your favourite word? Sunday. What is your favourite fantasy? That chocolate is not fattening. What makes you depressed? That in the year 2000 people sleep on the streets, and that doctors and nurses get paid so little for what they do. What do you most dislike about your appearance? On the days my jeans don't fit, I hate everything; on the days they slip on fine, it's all good. How did you vote in the last election? Labour. How will you vote in the next election? Labour. Let's hope Tony's put some real money into the health service by then. Have you ever said 'I love you' and not meant it? Yes, sorry! When and where were you happiest? Standing on top of Ayers Rock in Australia as the sun was coming up. How do you relax? Have a bath with loads of bubbles. What would your motto be? Go for it. How would you like to die? Peacefully - but not until I'd achieved everything I want to do. Do you believe in life after death? Yes. How would you like to be remembered? Being remembered at all would be nice. What is the most important lesson life has taught you? Tell people you love them while you have the chance.",

Go for a long drive, throw them away and then count sheep on your way back.",

It cannot be called sweet, or even rounded, but the fruit is of the level that exults in moderately spicy food. Terra Viva Vino da Tavola Organic Red 1998 (15.5 points, normally \u00a33.99) is simply the best organic, for the money, I've tasted from Italy. It's dry and very darkly fruited, that is to say that black cherries and touches of catering chocolate come to mind.</p> <p>But then this is more or less the sort of fruit you find in Asda s non-vintage Merlot Vin de Pays d'Oc (15 points, \u00a32.99), which, in addition to the cherries, packs a terrific earthy bite. Asda's Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a33.99) is more elegant. It s so drinkable and well-knit that it performs like a wine costing a good deal more, with great texture, richness and warm, aromatic fruit.</p> <p>Asda's Tramontane range has continued to offer value and modernity, and the latest vintages are well up to par. Tramontane Grenache Vin de Pays d'Oc 1998 (16 points, \u00a33.99) is juicy with hints of herbs. Great rollicking style. Tramontane Vin de Pays de l'Aude 1999 (16 points, \u00a32.99) has brilliant earthy richness and ripeness. Tramontane Merlot Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99) shows some delicious characterful earthiness.</p> <p>There are three further reds at Asda worth investigating. Chteau Lahore Bergez Fitou 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99) has superb richness, character, weight and finesse. Yes, it has some mild rusticity, but this is its charm. It's a great food wine. Chteau de Parenchere Bordeaux Superieure 1997 (16.5 points, \u00a35.99) is a superb young claret, with texture, class, richness, handsome tannicity and a well-concentrated finish. Asda s own-label Argentinian Syrah 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99) is not remotely like Aussie shiraz or Rhne syrah. It is a revelation of spiciness and richness and deeply textured fruit. There is great concentration of elements in this wine.</p> <p>At Thresher wine shops, there is Concha y Toro Casillero del Diablo Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), from Chile. It is a consummately concentrated, juicy, fresh, fruity, character-laden, deep, shallow, subtle, extravagant - how many contradictions can a mouthful of alcoholic grape juice contain? At Thresher, and its partner Victoria Wine (but not at Wine Rack or Bottoms Up), there is Jumilla Senorio de Robles 1998 (16 points, \u00a33.49), from Spain. A bargain wine for summer barbecues as well as winter firesides, it's dry, plummy, soft, characterful and hugely quaffable - and it'll go with loads of foods.</p> <p>Somerfield has three delightfully drinkable reds on offer. The own-label Montepulciano d Abruzzo 1998 (15.5 points) has a quid knocked off its usual \u00a33.99 from May 10 until May 23. Do not expect to get away with \u00a32.99 for this wine until that date, because the individual stores are not advised of price reductions until a few hours before the commencement. It is worth waiting a few days for this wine. It is soft and ripe, with slightly smoky, earthy tannins to hold the whole structure up. It is intensely quaffable.</p> <p>As is Bright Brothers Negroamaro Cabernet Sauvignon 1998, from Puglia, the heel of Italy. This wine has already come down in price to \u00a33.49 (rating 15.5 points) and it performs much like the Montepulciano, though there is more hedgerow fruitiness but even then there are tannins to give it backbone. It s on offer until May 23. Also reduced, to \u00a33.29 until that day, is the Spanish Sierra Alta Cabernet Sauvignon 1998, which is lovely stuff, parading, as it does, cherry and blackcurrants, terrific textures and a delicious warm finish.

      "body": "<p>Along weekend in the east of Holland, last month, was revealing, as always, of differences and similarities with ourselves. The season was just about where we were, perhaps a week behind; the weather was equally unpleasant and predictably unpredictable.</p> <p>There were no shabby front gardens; nobody would let the side down. Equally, there was none for which you could exclaim, \"That owner obviously loves plants.\" A uniformity was evident in the plants used. There is something about worthy plants that brings out in me vicious stabs of hatred that are totally unjustified. I suppose \"foundation planting\" is the expression one would use of Mahonia aquifolium . It was in full bloom (yawn) and backed up by its evergreen foliage (tatty at winter's end). After flowering, the whole shrub can be pruned over without any loss of subsequent charm. It is a staunch friend in good times and bad. Can you bear to live with it?

      "bodyText": "Along weekend in the east of Holland, last month, was revealing, as always, of differences and similarities with ourselves. The season was just about where we were, perhaps a week behind; the weather was equally unpleasant and predictably unpredictable. There were no shabby front gardens; nobody would let the side down. Equally, there was none for which you could exclaim, \"That owner obviously loves plants.\" A uniformity was evident in the plants used. There is something about worthy plants that brings out in me vicious stabs of hatred that are totally unjustified. I suppose \"foundation planting\" is the expression one would use of Mahonia aquifolium . It was in full bloom (yawn) and backed up by its evergreen foliage (tatty at winter's end). After flowering, the whole shrub can be pruned over without any loss of subsequent charm. It is a staunch friend in good times and bad. Can you bear to live with it? Can you bear to live without it?

      "body": "<p>It should have been the grandest of scientific occasions. On stage at the world-renowned Pasteur Institute in Paris, Craig Venter, one of the world's foremost biological scientists, announced he was just weeks away from completing the greatest scientific endeavour that mankind has ever known: the human genome, the book of life of Homo sapiens . It should have been a victory lap, applause, praise, talk of Nobel prizes, and commendations from his peers.</p> <p>But instead there was silence. For most of the 600 academics in the audience, gathered from research institutes across the globe, Venter was the traitor; a ruthless competitor who sold his soul to American business and who now plans to charge the rest of the human race a fortune to read our own genetic code. \"I was totally against him being invited to speak,\" said one of the conference organisers bitterly. \"His first announcement when he created his company, Celera, was to attack the publicly-funded Human Genome Project. He wanted the public project to be closed so he would have a monopoly. He is extremely aggressive in his statements because, of course, he is speaking not to scientists but to his shareholders.\"</p> <p>To his critics, the American scientist is \"Darth Venter\", an evil monopolist. To his admirers, he's a genius - \"the Alan Turing [conqueror of the Enigma code] of his generation\" - who more than anyone has revolutionised the field of genomics but, through the jealousy of scientific pygmies, has been unjustly denied credit. \"You cannot repeal the laws of human nature,\" says Dr Sam Broder, a former director of the US National Cancer Institute and now chief medical officer at Celera. \"It would be appropriate if someone said, 'I'm angry, I'm jealous, I can't stand this.' It would be better if people had the courage to come out with it.\"</p> <p>Beneath the venom towards Venter lies another human emotion - fear. \"Everyone is frightened of losing,\" said a senior scientist from the Pasteur Institute. \"The human genome is only going to be sequenced once and it will never need to be done again. There are Nobel prizes riding on this. It's a big, big prize and it's technology driven. Craig is in cahoots with the American makers of the DNA sequencers we all use. He is also a self-aggrandising pain in the arse.\"</p> <p>But the race for the code of the human genome is not just another arcane battle between boffins to see who wins the prize, even if it is a Nobel. It's a race for the future, a war being fought in science laboratories across the world, with battalions of $300,000 DNA sequencing machines that chunder out, in order, the four base letters of the human code - ccacatgatatctatccaacccatgtcc . . .</p> <p>On one side is the publicly-funded Human Genome Project (HGP), which is decoding the human genome data and releasing it free of charge on the internet each night. And on the other is Celera, Venter's private upstart company founded in May 1998, which says its has decoded the genome cheaper and quicker than its slow-coach public rivals.</p> <p>Celera does have a built-in advantage. Its scientists can access the two billion-plus letters already decoded by the Human Genome Project by simply looking it up on the HGP's websites. Celera's own data is strictly private, but Venter says he will also publish their human genome data on Celera's own website. His critics ask \"when?\" and \"how much will it cost?\" Inevitably, Celera will place some restrictions on the use of its data.</p> <p>The race for the code is not just about science, it's also a tale of dirty tactics, brilliant scientific innovation, emotional insecurity, vicious bureaucratic in-fighting, black propaganda, rare joint presidential and prime ministerial statements, $225-a-share stock offerings, law suits and plain old-fashioned human goodness.</p> <p>The Human Genome Project, largely funded by US tax dollars but with a third of the money from the British medical charity the Wellcome Trust, is vast, and there are many key scientists involved. But it has ultimately become a fierce personal battle between two men, the would-be American billionaire, high-school drop-out, ex-surfer and Vietnam War veteran, Craig Venter, and his runner-bean-growing, Oxfam-supporting, second-hand car driving, bearded British academic opponent, John Sulston, of the Wellcome Trust. And instead of academic papers, both men now trade insults such as \"slimy\" and \"con job\".</p> <p>\"The people from the Wellcome Trust do not believe this shit that they are saying,\" says Venter, leaning back on the chair in his office at his Rockville headquarters, near Washington. \"It's much easier to demonise us than justify the hundreds of millions of dollars they have wasted. I have been a thorn in their side for some time because I keep coming up with breakthroughs. Having a rival in any sense is unacceptable to them. They are trying to destroy someone they view as a serious competitor. We did not set out to sequence the human genome just to make John Sulston and the Wellcome Trust look bad. What is it about Celera that has to be stopped - because we are trying to treat cancer, find treatments for disease?\"</p> <p>On the other side of the Atlantic, in his bare office in the shiny new Sanger Centre near Cambridge, Sulston takes an implacably hostile view of his enemy. \"Global capitalism is raping the earth, it's raping us. If global capitalism gets hold of complete control of the human genome, that is very bad news indeed, that is something we should fight against. I believe that our basic information, our 'software', should be free and open for everyone to play with, to compete with, to try and make products from. I do not believe it should be under the control of one person. But that is what Celera are trying to do as far as they can. They want to establish a monopoly position on the human sequence. Craig has gone morally wrong.\"</p> <p>The two men are roughly the same age - Venter is 54, Sulston, 57 - but could not be more different. Venter is brash, aggressive, egotistical. His list of considerable achievements trip off his tongue like a pre-printed CV. \"Is my science of the level, with the breakthroughs, consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes.\"</p> <p>The walls of his office are covered in trophies, magazine covers of Venter, pictures of his naval graduating class and time in Vietnam, honorary degrees, and signed photos from Bill Clinton. During our interview, when he was not taking calls from Wall Street analysts, he was on the line to Business Week talking up Celera's stock price, or to his financial backers. He had a gold Rolex on his wrist, and sprawled at his feet were three huge black poodles, whom he calls \"his children\". When Venter is not darting around in the company Lear Jet, he is on his 84ft yacht, The Sorcerer, or flying to Saudi Arabia to pick up some prize, or attending the White House Correspondents dinner. He is now a player, lobbying his Congressional allies hard, up there in the big league in Washington. Fifteen years ago, microbiologists had to beg for grants. On February 29, 2000, Celera raised $1billion in one day on the New York Stock Exchange.</p> <p>Venter likes to stand out from the dull pack of his fellow scientists. At one point he is called down to Celera's computer room, \"whose Compaq computing power is rivalled only by the Pentagon\", to pose for a New York photographer. He sits happily for 15 minutes, like a movie star. In more friendly times, Venter was once invited to a Wellcome Trust genomics conference in the Cotswolds. At Heathrow, the Trust laid on a bus to take arriving scientists directly to the conference. Venter was on the flight, but never took the bus - he turned up later in a hired Jaguar.</p> <p>In contrast, the bearded Sulston is a model of quiet British understatement. Instead of a Rolex he was wearing a pair of old leather sandals. His wild beard and hair give him the air of being an ex-hippy professor. Sulston's father was a vicar and he has the same ideals of public service and social compassion. \"The only thing I have retained from my upbringing - I did not retain the religious element - is the idea that you do not do things for money.\"</p> <p>Sulston's office is lined not with power trophies but his old notebooks, filled with hand-drawn pictures of the dividing cells of the 1mm nematode worm he studied for years. He gets around in the family car and second class on Great North Eastern Railways. Sulston is, he says, a Guardian-reading political liberal, whose wife Daphne took part in the Greenham Common anti-missile protests. He did not get to the top rungs of British science, and the forefront of a world scientific revolution, by being a laid-back guy. By chance, I had to ask him something on Easter Sunday; he was there at his desk. The Wellcome Trust may be a charity, but it is the most powerful independent scientific institution in Europe, if not the world. Its \u00a3300m purpose-built Sanger Centre is a big, big sequencing machine with one objective in mind - to clobber the opposition.</p> <p>The battle between Venter and Sulston is more than a personal clash. Once the human genome is decoded, it will begin to transform medicine, science, human fertility, archaeology, genealogy, the insurance trade and the whole of human society. Knowledge of the human gemone, the code of life, will allow us to determine exactly what it is that makes us human. The code may give us the cure for cancer, heart disease, a thousand genetic human frailties. It will tell us who has a predisposition to be gay, to be depressed, to be good at metabolising oxygen and hence good at sport, to get Alzheimer's, to die of bowel cancer at 53. We are aware of some of these things already; clever parents generally have clever children; heart attacks, like some breast cancers, run in the family. But the difference is that we will know. You can alter your behaviour, but you cannot alter your genes, yet. It will give you, and other powerful institutions in society such as insurance companies, the power to read the unique genetic bar-code that is contained in every cell of your body. Scientists have already identified 289 genes, mutations to the normal code, that directly cause diseases in humans. Soon we will know an awful lot more. We may not like the answers but we will have them.</p> <p>There are a 100 trillion cells in the human body. In the nucleus of each of these cells are 46 chromosomes, 23 from your mother and 23 from your father. Those chromosomes are made of DNA, a long molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid, whose famous double helix shape was the greatest scientific discovery of the 20th century. There are six feet of DNA in each human cell. And DNA is composed of four chemicals, or bases, adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C).</p> <p>It is these bases that are the digital code of life. Every living organism on earth, from microbes living in super-heated sulphur vents two miles down on the bottom of the ocean, to bacteria, roundworms, wheat, fish, trees, cows, chimpanzees (who share 98.9% of our human DNA) is composed of letters of the same A, T, G, C genetic code. It is the one and only alphabet of life - hence the ability of researchers to insert \"fish\" genes into plants.</p> <p>There are 3.5 billion bases in the human genome. The human genome is, in effect, a single sentence: ccacatgatatctatccaacccatgtccccacatgatatctatccaacccatgtccccacatgata tctatccaacccatgtcc and so on until it would fill 500,000 pages of a telephone directory. It is equivalent to 750 megabytes of data and will fit on one DVD disk. Most of that genome is junk: between 95 and 97% is redundant, the left-over genetic instructions for what to do with our fins or tails; we still carry with us our evolutionary ascent from bacteria in the swamp. Scattered at random amid this genomic sentence are the 100,000 genes - active sequences - which code for the 20 amino acids that make up the body's proteins. Everything that we are as humans, from our toes to our hormones, to the synaptic gaps in our brains, muscles, bones, to when and how our cells divide, is, or is the product of, proteins. Our genes are the codes for these proteins. They are the telephone numbers that actually work.</p> <p>Each of those genes can be thousands of letters long. Other parts of the genome, which do not code for genes, also act like a control mechanism and play a role in the way genes interact or the way a human foetus is formed. Our genome is the book of human life. \"As long as there are humans in the universe, it will be essential,\" says John Sulston.</p> <p>Decoding the human genome will increase our knowledge, a thousandfold times a thousandfold of the nature of Homo sapiens . And with that knowledge will come immense power. Before we create, we will almost certainly destroy, committing a new form of human selection, genomecide. Through systematic but simple foetal genetic tests in the next decade, we will ruthlessly search out and eradicate those human genes we regard as inferior, Trisonomy 21 or Down's Syndrome, Turner's Syndrome, Huntingdon's Chorea, Cystic Fibrosis; the list is as long as we want to make it. The difficulty we will have to face is where do you draw the line? Do you abort multi-celled foetuses because the tests show genes that code for Alzheimer's in later life? Would we now eradicate the former US President Ronald Reagan, whose Alzheimer's is genetically inherited, just after conception? What is the definition of an acceptable genetic human being? What is a valid human life? In America, where medical insurance is a key issue, the first cases of genetic discrimination are already appearing in the courts.</p> <p>In time, we will begin to manipulate our genes, select the traits we want in our children, designer babies, just as we are now altering the genes of the plants and animals.</p> <p>There will be great benefits, a cure for Aids, malaria, maybe eventually nearly all of the diseases that afflict humanity. Genomics is the future of a whole new set of pharmaceutical industries that will create thousands of individually tailored drugs.</p> <p>We are at the beginning of a genomic century and in the midst of a biological gold rush. Every day, the US Patent and Trademark Office is flooded with new patent applications from US biotech companies such as Incyte, Human Genomic Sciences, and Celera, claiming patent rights - exclusive property rights - on the 100,000 genes in the human body. Celera alone is believed to have filed more than 20,000 provisional patents. Incyte aims to patent one million of what are known as ESTs, expressed sequence tags, snippets of the genetic code that identify genes, whose functions may be entirely unknown at the time of patenting.</p> <p>Along with the benefits will come unparalleled profits, wealth beyond even the dreams of Microsoft's Bill Gates, as a few companies carve themselves monopolies from the code of human life. The first battles have already begun. Aids researchers have recently identified the pathway, or docking site, known as the CCR5 receptor, by which the Aids virus enters human cells. Block that doorway and, potentially, you have a cure for the most expensive disease in human history - a virus that has killed and lethally infected 30m people. But the gene for CCR5 is \"owned\" by Human Genomic Sciences Inc (HGS), of Rockville, Maryland, former collaborators of Venter, which is demanding royalties and licences from every drugs company that wants to work on CCR5, even though HGS admits it had no idea of the gene's function in Aids when it filed the patent application.</p> <p>Having a monopoly on an individual gene is one thing, but controlling access to the human sequence itself would give the means of taxing every single biological research project for the next 20 years. Genes do not work in isolation. The 100,000 genes in every cell of our bodies interact in ways that are still unknown to us. To understand those interactions, scientists will have continually to return to the whole genome sequence. Whoever owned exclusive rights to the sequence could quite easily become the richest person in the world and stifle any research that threatened their monopoly. Controlling the sequence would be like owning copyright on the letters ABC of the alphabet. Celera's declared aim is to became the \"definitive\" source of genomic information, so definitive that drugs companies will pay millions for the data, even though HGP will provide a rival version for free. Being first in the race for the code would be a huge propaganda victory. But in Sulston's view, it also explains Celera's attacks on the publicly-funded project. Celera wants to undermine and degrade its only possible rival; for \"definitive\" read \"monopoly\".</p> <p>For Craig Venter, the race for the code began during the 1968 Tet Offensive in a Da Nang field hospital in South Vietnam, where, as a medical corpsman, he was suddenly confronting thousands of casualties. The communist Vietcong launched a surprise offensive against US bases on the eve of the traditional Vietnamese holiday; there was bloody hand-to-hand fighting all over South Vietnam. \"I had to learn, in real time, what triage actually meant. I dealt with the death of thousands of men my age. It was a life-altering experience. The biggest thing was the loss of my innocence. The loss of the sense of immortality that goes with being young. Life was so cheap in Vietnam. And that is where my sense of urgency comes from. Before that, I had no urgency at all.\"</p> <p>Vietnam was the making of Venter. Although he came from a military family - his parents, John and Elizabeth, met in the Marines in 1943, in San Diego - he had dropped out of high school. Before he was drafted in 1965, he had been a beach bum, a champion swimmer, whose main occupation was surfing and sailing the waters of San Francisco bay. He originally intended to join the US Navy swim team, but ended up in the medical corps as a freak result of the IQ tests undertaken by every recruit. Venter had, out of 35,000 tests, the highest score, over 140, and was immediately offered a specialism. The medical corps, unlike nuclear engineering, was the only specialism that did not require signing up beyond three years. He trained as an army medic and found that he loved it.</p> <p>After Vietnam, Venter returned to the US determined to get a medical degree and work in the developing world. In six years, he crash-coursed his way through a local community college to get basic qualifications, and then the University of California med school.

Isolating genes, cloning them in sufficient quantities to engage in experiments, was a tedious, frustrating process. Sequencing was messy and cumbersome, involving radioactive dyes and X-ray film.

In science, the same people, in a few powerful positions, control the input and the output.

Today, both Celera and the Human Genome Project churn out millions of letters a day by using banks of sophisticated sequencers. Genomic science has become an industrial rather than a scientific process: it simply would not be possible to decode the 3.5 billion bases of the human genome without this automation. It was Venter, in 1987, who ordered the first automated gene sequencer and worked closely with the manufacturer, Applied Biosystems, to test and improve the nascent technology.

      "bodyText": "It should have been the grandest of scientific occasions. On stage at the world-renowned Pasteur Institute in Paris, Craig Venter, one of the world's foremost biological scientists, announced he was just weeks away from completing the greatest scientific endeavour that mankind has ever known: the human genome, the book of life of Homo sapiens . It should have been a victory lap, applause, praise, talk of Nobel prizes, and commendations from his peers. But instead there was silence. For most of the 600 academics in the audience, gathered from research institutes across the globe, Venter was the traitor; a ruthless competitor who sold his soul to American business and who now plans to charge the rest of the human race a fortune to read our own genetic code. \"I was totally against him being invited to speak,\" said one of the conference organisers bitterly. \"His first announcement when he created his company, Celera, was to attack the publicly-funded Human Genome Project. He wanted the public project to be closed so he would have a monopoly. He is extremely aggressive in his statements because, of course, he is speaking not to scientists but to his shareholders.\" To his critics, the American scientist is \"Darth Venter\", an evil monopolist. To his admirers, he's a genius - \"the Alan Turing [conqueror of the Enigma code] of his generation\" - who more than anyone has revolutionised the field of genomics but, through the jealousy of scientific pygmies, has been unjustly denied credit. \"You cannot repeal the laws of human nature,\" says Dr Sam Broder, a former director of the US National Cancer Institute and now chief medical officer at Celera. \"It would be appropriate if someone said, 'I'm angry, I'm jealous, I can't stand this.' It would be better if people had the courage to come out with it.\" Beneath the venom towards Venter lies another human emotion - fear. \"Everyone is frightened of losing,\" said a senior scientist from the Pasteur Institute. \"The human genome is only going to be sequenced once and it will never need to be done again. There are Nobel prizes riding on this. It's a big, big prize and it's technology driven. Craig is in cahoots with the American makers of the DNA sequencers we all use. He is also a self-aggrandising pain in the arse.\" But the race for the code of the human genome is not just another arcane battle between boffins to see who wins the prize, even if it is a Nobel. It's a race for the future, a war being fought in science laboratories across the world, with battalions of $300,000 DNA sequencing machines that chunder out, in order, the four base letters of the human code - ccacatgatatctatccaacccatgtcc . . . On one side is the publicly-funded Human Genome Project (HGP), which is decoding the human genome data and releasing it free of charge on the internet each night. And on the other is Celera, Venter's private upstart company founded in May 1998, which says its has decoded the genome cheaper and quicker than its slow-coach public rivals. Celera does have a built-in advantage. Its scientists can access the two billion-plus letters already decoded by the Human Genome Project by simply looking it up on the HGP's websites. Celera's own data is strictly private, but Venter says he will also publish their human genome data on Celera's own website. His critics ask \"when?\" and \"how much will it cost?\" Inevitably, Celera will place some restrictions on the use of its data. The race for the code is not just about science, it's also a tale of dirty tactics, brilliant scientific innovation, emotional insecurity, vicious bureaucratic in-fighting, black propaganda, rare joint presidential and prime ministerial statements, $225-a-share stock offerings, law suits and plain old-fashioned human goodness. The Human Genome Project, largely funded by US tax dollars but with a third of the money from the British medical charity the Wellcome Trust, is vast, and there are many key scientists involved. But it has ultimately become a fierce personal battle between two men, the would-be American billionaire, high-school drop-out, ex-surfer and Vietnam War veteran, Craig Venter, and his runner-bean-growing, Oxfam-supporting, second-hand car driving, bearded British academic opponent, John Sulston, of the Wellcome Trust. And instead of academic papers, both men now trade insults such as \"slimy\" and \"con job\". \"The people from the Wellcome Trust do not believe this shit that they are saying,\" says Venter, leaning back on the chair in his office at his Rockville headquarters, near Washington. \"It's much easier to demonise us than justify the hundreds of millions of dollars they have wasted. I have been a thorn in their side for some time because I keep coming up with breakthroughs. Having a rival in any sense is unacceptable to them. They are trying to destroy someone they view as a serious competitor. We did not set out to sequence the human genome just to make John Sulston and the Wellcome Trust look bad. What is it about Celera that has to be stopped - because we are trying to treat cancer, find treatments for disease?\" On the other side of the Atlantic, in his bare office in the shiny new Sanger Centre near Cambridge, Sulston takes an implacably hostile view of his enemy. \"Global capitalism is raping the earth, it's raping us. If global capitalism gets hold of complete control of the human genome, that is very bad news indeed, that is something we should fight against. I believe that our basic information, our 'software', should be free and open for everyone to play with, to compete with, to try and make products from. I do not believe it should be under the control of one person. But that is what Celera are trying to do as far as they can. They want to establish a monopoly position on the human sequence. Craig has gone morally wrong.\" The two men are roughly the same age - Venter is 54, Sulston, 57 - but could not be more different. Venter is brash, aggressive, egotistical. His list of considerable achievements trip off his tongue like a pre-printed CV. \"Is my science of the level, with the breakthroughs, consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes.\" The walls of his office are covered in trophies, magazine covers of Venter, pictures of his naval graduating class and time in Vietnam, honorary degrees, and signed photos from Bill Clinton. During our interview, when he was not taking calls from Wall Street analysts, he was on the line to Business Week talking up Celera's stock price, or to his financial backers. He had a gold Rolex on his wrist, and sprawled at his feet were three huge black poodles, whom he calls \"his children\". When Venter is not darting around in the company Lear Jet, he is on his 84ft yacht, The Sorcerer, or flying to Saudi Arabia to pick up some prize, or attending the White House Correspondents dinner. He is now a player, lobbying his Congressional allies hard, up there in the big league in Washington. Fifteen years ago, microbiologists had to beg for grants. On February 29, 2000, Celera raised $1billion in one day on the New York Stock Exchange. Venter likes to stand out from the dull pack of his fellow scientists. At one point he is called down to Celera's computer room, \"whose Compaq computing power is rivalled only by the Pentagon\", to pose for a New York photographer. He sits happily for 15 minutes, like a movie star. In more friendly times, Venter was once invited to a Wellcome Trust genomics conference in the Cotswolds. At Heathrow, the Trust laid on a bus to take arriving scientists directly to the conference. Venter was on the flight, but never took the bus - he turned up later in a hired Jaguar. In contrast, the bearded Sulston is a model of quiet British understatement. Instead of a Rolex he was wearing a pair of old leather sandals. His wild beard and hair give him the air of being an ex-hippy professor. Sulston's father was a vicar and he has the same ideals of public service and social compassion. \"The only thing I have retained from my upbringing - I did not retain the religious element - is the idea that you do not do things for money.\" Sulston's office is lined not with power trophies but his old notebooks, filled with hand-drawn pictures of the dividing cells of the 1mm nematode worm he studied for years. He gets around in the family car and second class on Great North Eastern Railways. Sulston is, he says, a Guardian-reading political liberal, whose wife Daphne took part in the Greenham Common anti-missile protests. He did not get to the top rungs of British science, and the forefront of a world scientific revolution, by being a laid-back guy. By chance, I had to ask him something on Easter Sunday; he was there at his desk. The Wellcome Trust may be a charity, but it is the most powerful independent scientific institution in Europe, if not the world. Its \u00a3300m purpose-built Sanger Centre is a big, big sequencing machine with one objective in mind - to clobber the opposition. The battle between Venter and Sulston is more than a personal clash. Once the human genome is decoded, it will begin to transform medicine, science, human fertility, archaeology, genealogy, the insurance trade and the whole of human society. Knowledge of the human gemone, the code of life, will allow us to determine exactly what it is that makes us human. The code may give us the cure for cancer, heart disease, a thousand genetic human frailties. It will tell us who has a predisposition to be gay, to be depressed, to be good at metabolising oxygen and hence good at sport, to get Alzheimer's, to die of bowel cancer at 53. We are aware of some of these things already; clever parents generally have clever children; heart attacks, like some breast cancers, run in the family. But the difference is that we will know. You can alter your behaviour, but you cannot alter your genes, yet. It will give you, and other powerful institutions in society such as insurance companies, the power to read the unique genetic bar-code that is contained in every cell of your body. Scientists have already identified 289 genes, mutations to the normal code, that directly cause diseases in humans. Soon we will know an awful lot more. We may not like the answers but we will have them. There are a 100 trillion cells in the human body. In the nucleus of each of these cells are 46 chromosomes, 23 from your mother and 23 from your father. Those chromosomes are made of DNA, a long molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid, whose famous double helix shape was the greatest scientific discovery of the 20th century. There are six feet of DNA in each human cell. And DNA is composed of four chemicals, or bases, adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). It is these bases that are the digital code of life. Every living organism on earth, from microbes living in super-heated sulphur vents two miles down on the bottom of the ocean, to bacteria, roundworms, wheat, fish, trees, cows, chimpanzees (who share 98.9% of our human DNA) is composed of letters of the same A, T, G, C genetic code. It is the one and only alphabet of life - hence the ability of researchers to insert \"fish\" genes into plants. There are 3.5 billion bases in the human genome. The human genome is, in effect, a single sentence: ccacatgatatctatccaacccatgtccccacatgatatctatccaacccatgtccccacatgata tctatccaacccatgtcc and so on until it would fill 500,000 pages of a telephone directory. It is equivalent to 750 megabytes of data and will fit on one DVD disk. Most of that genome is junk: between 95 and 97% is redundant, the left-over genetic instructions for what to do with our fins or tails; we still carry with us our evolutionary ascent from bacteria in the swamp. Scattered at random amid this genomic sentence are the 100,000 genes - active sequences - which code for the 20 amino acids that make up the body's proteins. Everything that we are as humans, from our toes to our hormones, to the synaptic gaps in our brains, muscles, bones, to when and how our cells divide, is, or is the product of, proteins. Our genes are the codes for these proteins. They are the telephone numbers that actually work. Each of those genes can be thousands of letters long. Other parts of the genome, which do not code for genes, also act like a control mechanism and play a role in the way genes interact or the way a human foetus is formed. Our genome is the book of human life. \"As long as there are humans in the universe, it will be essential,\" says John Sulston. Decoding the human genome will increase our knowledge, a thousandfold times a thousandfold of the nature of Homo sapiens . And with that knowledge will come immense power. Before we create, we will almost certainly destroy, committing a new form of human selection, genomecide. Through systematic but simple foetal genetic tests in the next decade, we will ruthlessly search out and eradicate those human genes we regard as inferior, Trisonomy 21 or Down's Syndrome, Turner's Syndrome, Huntingdon's Chorea, Cystic Fibrosis; the list is as long as we want to make it. The difficulty we will have to face is where do you draw the line? Do you abort multi-celled foetuses because the tests show genes that code for Alzheimer's in later life? Would we now eradicate the former US President Ronald Reagan, whose Alzheimer's is genetically inherited, just after conception? What is the definition of an acceptable genetic human being? What is a valid human life? In America, where medical insurance is a key issue, the first cases of genetic discrimination are already appearing in the courts. In time, we will begin to manipulate our genes, select the traits we want in our children, designer babies, just as we are now altering the genes of the plants and animals. There will be great benefits, a cure for Aids, malaria, maybe eventually nearly all of the diseases that afflict humanity. Genomics is the future of a whole new set of pharmaceutical industries that will create thousands of individually tailored drugs. We are at the beginning of a genomic century and in the midst of a biological gold rush. Every day, the US Patent and Trademark Office is flooded with new patent applications from US biotech companies such as Incyte, Human Genomic Sciences, and Celera, claiming patent rights - exclusive property rights - on the 100,000 genes in the human body. Celera alone is believed to have filed more than 20,000 provisional patents. Incyte aims to patent one million of what are known as ESTs, expressed sequence tags, snippets of the genetic code that identify genes, whose functions may be entirely unknown at the time of patenting. Along with the benefits will come unparalleled profits, wealth beyond even the dreams of Microsoft's Bill Gates, as a few companies carve themselves monopolies from the code of human life. The first battles have already begun. Aids researchers have recently identified the pathway, or docking site, known as the CCR5 receptor, by which the Aids virus enters human cells. Block that doorway and, potentially, you have a cure for the most expensive disease in human history - a virus that has killed and lethally infected 30m people. But the gene for CCR5 is \"owned\" by Human Genomic Sciences Inc (HGS), of Rockville, Maryland, former collaborators of Venter, which is demanding royalties and licences from every drugs company that wants to work on CCR5, even though HGS admits it had no idea of the gene's function in Aids when it filed the patent application. Having a monopoly on an individual gene is one thing, but controlling access to the human sequence itself would give the means of taxing every single biological research project for the next 20 years. Genes do not work in isolation. The 100,000 genes in every cell of our bodies interact in ways that are still unknown to us. To understand those interactions, scientists will have continually to return to the whole genome sequence. Whoever owned exclusive rights to the sequence could quite easily become the richest person in the world and stifle any research that threatened their monopoly. Controlling the sequence would be like owning copyright on the letters ABC of the alphabet. Celera's declared aim is to became the \"definitive\" source of genomic information, so definitive that drugs companies will pay millions for the data, even though HGP will provide a rival version for free. Being first in the race for the code would be a huge propaganda victory. But in Sulston's view, it also explains Celera's attacks on the publicly-funded project. Celera wants to undermine and degrade its only possible rival; for \"definitive\" read \"monopoly\". For Craig Venter, the race for the code began during the 1968 Tet Offensive in a Da Nang field hospital in South Vietnam, where, as a medical corpsman, he was suddenly confronting thousands of casualties.

Along the way, he shifted into medical research and began teaching at the State University of New York, where he met his future wife and collaborator, Claire Fraser. Part of the key to Venter lies in this unorthodox academic ascent. Although the Community College of San Mateo - whose other most famous alumnus is John Belushi -and the State University of New York are competent institutions, they are far from being the great scientific centres of the West. Venter was never a traditional insider. In the late 70s, he began working on the adrenalin receptor in the brain. Isolating genes, cloning them in sufficient quantities to engage in experiments, was a tedious, frustrating process. Sequencing was messy and cumbersome, involving radioactive dyes and X-ray film. It could take 10 years to isolate one gene. And everything depended on precious grants doled out by the scientific elite.

      "body": "<p>Vanessa Redgrave either chose to ignore or, more likely, failed even to notice the compliment. A gushing admirer - describing her performance as Nora Melody in A Touch Of The Poet - had spoken of \"pure magic\" and insisted that she actually \"became the old, downtrodden and defeated\" wife of Eugene O'Neill's brutal braggart. But, instead of impatiently brushing the tribute aside or offering her fluttering thanks, she turned to her brother Corin: \"Con Melody would be a great part for you\". She smiled at the thought of his potential success. </p> <p>Then, addressing nobody in particular, Vanessa Redgrave asked, \"Do you realise that it's the same story as The Deep Blue Sea\" - the play by Terence Rattigan about a judge's wife who gives up everything for a younger man - \"a woman who willingly sacrifices herself for a man she believes to be a hero?\" It was a perfect illustration of three of the characteristics which govern her complicated personality - reverence for her brother, a penchant for dramatic theories which are most charitably described as novel, and admirable distaste for the flattery which follows fame. Redgrave behaves as if she does not realise how great a star she is - even though her status is confirmed by everyone who speaks about her. </p> <p>Edward Fox - not a natural ally - commenting on her performance in the film Julia, repeats more or less the comment stuttered out by her adoring fan: \"She became Julia. One leg. Victim of Nazi persecution. Everything.\" In its way, playing Julia - Lillian Hellman's radical heroine - was ideological type-casting. And it won Redgrave an Oscar. But can she become Prospero, in this month's Globe production of the Tempest? For Prospero, if we are to rely on Shakespeare's text, is a man. </p> <p>Fox is even enthusiastic about the prospect of that unconventional casting. \"Wouldn't go to see any other actress do it. But Vanessa is different.\" It is an extraordinary tribute to an actress for whom acting was, at least at the beginning of her career, only second best. Despite the Oscar, the Cannes Palme D'Or, the Evening Standard drama awards and the Olivier prize - all in the cabinet in her drawing room - Redgrave still speaks with obvious regret of her failure to become a ballerina. </p> <p>She insists, \"All my tragic moments about what I missed came when I was much younger\". But the yearning in her voice - part of the happy inheritance from her father - is always most pronounced when she talks of those youthful dreams of classical ballet. They faded simply because she grew too tall. </p> <p>Perhaps her parents always secretly wanted her to act, not dance. In August 1937, Laurence Olivier, playing Hamlet, interrupted his own curtain call with the news, \"Tonight a great actress was born. Laertes has a daughter.\" Laertes - Michael Redgrave - had met Rachel Kempson, Vanessa's mother, when they were playing a season of repertory in Liverpool. They married and moved to London to join Tyrone Guthrie at the Old Vic. </p> <p>Michael, after starring in The Lady Vanishes and The Stars Look Down, was voted the most popular film actor in England. The war, and stardom, kept him away from his family. But, says Vanessa, they \"accepted that was the way things were\". With Christmas and a reunion in prospect they \"wore out fingers and thumbs making presents - pipe holders and pen wipers\". Affection and admiration were indivisible. </p> <p>Fifteen years after his death, Michael Redgrave is still a living influence on his daughter. Only last year she told Edward Fox that every time she re-read An Actor's Ways and Means, a collection of lectures given by her father at Bristol University, her acting improved. She still talks, with regret, about the films she missed and, with proud satisfaction, about the plays she saw. Asked about his performance in Antony and Cleopatra, at a time of physical illness and mental anguish, she obviously still feels the pain. Loss of memory, an early symptom of undiagnosed Parkinson's disease, was prejudicing his whole career. \"We were all on tenterhooks over this terrible thing about him not being able to learn his lines. He got on top of it. But all I remember is sitting there with knots in my stomach\". </p> <p>Anguish aside, it was a highly privileged childhood. \"One day my father came home and said, 'You're going to present a bouquet to Princess Elizabeth at the Royal Command Performance. And you are to have a lovely new dress'. Lovely dress! Yes, thank you. Anyway, I was quite awe-struck. I had collected pictures of the little princesses from my nanny's magazines\". Redgrave is careful to point out that she \"was not presented at court but went to friends' coming-out parties. Coming out had a different meaning in those days.\" </p> <p>Rachel Kempson knew before her marriage that Michael Redgrave was bisexual. \"Of course\", she told her grown-up children, \"I thought I could change him.\" She was wrong. Her daughter now talks of her father's complicated emotional life with a relaxed frankness that makes nonsense of gossip-column theories about its discovery causing her own marital upheavals and excursions on to the wilder shores of politics. Their relationship is perfectly summed up by brother Corin, \"For Vanessa, he was much the most important influence on her life,\" and \"he worshipped her talent as if it had nothing to do with his own\". </p> <p>Inevitably, the daughter of Michael Redgrave enjoyed opportunities denied to other young actresses. After the ballet classes, and a year or two at the exclusive Queensgate girls school in Lon don, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Her description of the three years that followed confirms her retrospective contempt for the tuition. \"I took my training very seriously. I was so ignorant about what sort of training existed abroad that I was just thrilled to be there. I was totally uncritical.\" </p> <p>She won the Sybil Thorndike Prize and left to join the Frinton-on-Sea repertory company. The first part she remembers playing was Helena in Look Back In Anger. \"I felt totally unsuitable. Helena was calm, sophisticated and superior, and I was none of those things. I wanted to be poor put-upon Alison. But I got Helena.\" </p> <p>It is hard to imagine Redgrave hoping to be type-cast as the woman John Osborne made Jimmy Porter call \"Lady Pusillanimous\". But if her confidence really needed a boost, it was provided by an invitation to play in N C Hunter's A Touch of the Sun. She volunteers, without embarrassment, that the offer came \"at the request\" of her father. </p> <p>The action is set in the south of France. Vanessa recalls, \"I could feel I was there!\" That description is an explanation of her genius - the ability to become, rather than act, the parts she plays. It is a quality which Peter Hall describes as \"absolute veracity - the determination to hold nothing back\". In rehearsal she goes \"immediately into top gear. It enables her to ignite a scene\" and, combined with \"an extraordinary generosity on stage to other actors\", means that \"people who play with her are likely to play better, because of her presence\". </p> <p>It was Hall who asked Redgrave to join the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford and play Rosalind in As You Like It. The woman in boy's clothing, walking through the Forest of Arden swinging her velvet cap as she confesses her love, became one of the defining images of the 60s. And Rosalind's reappearance, in a gleaming white dress - triumphantly a woman being a woman - was one of the great moments of 20th-century theatre. Peter Hall recalls how Jean Renoir reacted to the sudden magic. \"Like most directors, he was always reluctant to watch other people's work. But I persuaded him to stand at the back of the theatre for a minute or two. On came Vanessa and he asked with proper Gallic enthusiasm, 'Oo is that girl?' He stayed for the rest of the play.\" </p> <p>Renoir was not the only director to be entranced by Rosalind. Tony Richardson, who had rejected Vanessa for a part in his film of Look Back In Anger, fell in love with her when he saw her in As You Like It. They were married in 1962 and the birth, in quick succession, of Natasha and Joely, now themselves internationally successful successful actors, meant that for three years motherhood took precedence over stage and screen. But in 1966, she came back with a succession of bangs - The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie on stage, and five films, including Morgan - A Suitable Case for Treatment, Blow-Up, and Camelot. </p> <p>Perhaps she worked so hard that year because she was unhappy. Tony Richardson, after three years of marriage, had fallen in love with Jeanne Moreau. Despite all Redgrave's attempts to rescue the marriage, including abandoning a \"cultural exchange\" delegation on its way to Moscow in the hope of convincing him that he was the centre of her life, they parted in Rome. Art imitated life. Richardson was directing a film in which Moreau starred, while his wife had only a small part. </p> <p>But, when Joshua Logan asked her to play Guinevere in Camelot, it was from her estranged husband that she sought advice. \"I was about to turn it down. But Tony said 'You'd be absolutely mad. If you do Camelot, everyone will want you to be in their films. If you don't, nobody will'. That's how it works. Because I did Camelot, I got offered almost everything that was going.\" </p> <p>To many of her warmest admirers, Redgrave seemed an unlikely (singing) Guinevere. And there have been other films, from Murder On The Orient Express to Yanks, which critics thought unworthy of her classical talents. She gamely defends every one, but explains that she does them \"so that I can do theatre\", where it is \"quite impossible to make a living. I'm going to start a year's work at Shakespeare's Globe followed by the National Theatre. It will all but ruin me. Films, often made when I need a holiday, make it possible. I get \u00a3400 a week at the Globe and \u00a3600 a week at the National. If I just relied on that, I couldn't pay the mortgage.\" </p> <p>And, as if to prove her point, 36 hours after the end of her long run in Noel Coward's Song At Twilight, she flew off to Canada for a week's filming before she began rehearsals of The Tempest, only pausing to take a couple of Chechen politicians to a lunch with sympathetic dons in Oxford, Chechnya being her current cause. </p> <p>An actress who has starred in so many films should not be short of money. But Eileen Atkins - perhaps Redgrave's closest friend and the woman she regards as \"probably the best actress in the world\" - says: \"She's given it all away. Swimming pools for schools. All sorts of things. She lives very humbly. Have you seen her flat? It's nothing very special. The films are what she lives on.\" </p> <p>Redgrave is not the woman to rest the justification of her dra matic decisions on anything as prosaic as the hope of fame and the need for money. If provoked, she will defend every film she made. \"I wanted to do Camelot because it was all about equality,\" adding, like the revelation of a new truth, \"they had a round table.\" Questions about King Arthur's status, and the life of the serfs outside the castle walls, do nothing to shake her theory about \"the one brief shining moment\". Her original theories about the parts she plays and the plays in which she performed have become the stuff of theatrical legend. </p> <p>Atkins has a fund of stories which illustrate the combination of absurdity and dramatic genius which marks the Redgrave approach to acting. \"In every new production she has about 50 original ideas: 49 are ludicrous and one is brilliant.\" During rehearsals for Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman at the National Theatre, \"she suddenly threw herself on the floor\". That was judged ridiculous. But then she started cutting in before Atkins had finished her lines. \"At first\", Atkins says \"I was irritated. Then we realised that it gave the whole scene the urgency which it lacked.\" </p> <p>Redgrave's ideas for improving Vita and Virginia - the letters of Mesdames Sackville-West and Wolfe, prepared for the stage by Atkins - were even more original. The problem of conveying the physical side of the characters' relationship \"without the unattractive sight of two middle-aged women kissing\" could, she told Atkins, be overcome by having two ropes hanging down on the stage, and the two lesbian lovers swinging out over the stalls to replicate their ecstasy. That was rejected. But her idea of conveying their constant partings by covering the furniture with sheets - an instantly recognisable image of desolation - \"added a new dimension\" to the show. </p> <p>Peter Hall recalls how, towards the end of rehearsals for Tennessee Williams's Orpheus Descending, Redgrave concluded that the spirit of the play could not be adequately conveyed by synthetic music and arrived one day carrying several mandolins. Hall resisted but, before the play transferred to Broadway, she began to take mandolin lessons in the hope of changing his mind. Hall believes that sensible directors rejoice in her obtrusive originality. \"A lot of actors hold back 10 or 20% at rehearsals. She's 100% all the time.\" </p> <p>The willingness to risk rejection and perhaps even ridicule is, Atkins says, proof of Redgrave's \"supreme self-confidence. She is braver than most actors, braver in general, not just brave on the stage. That makes her absolutely spontaneous. She has no feeling of fear that she is going to make a fool of herself.\" Atkins attributes the courage and confidence to her privileged, if unconventional, background - great actors enjoying great public acclaim as they privately endured the stress of con stantly shifting liaisons. It may also be responsible for one of her most endearing qualities. Redgrave is, she says, \"transparently vulnerable\". </p> <p>Perhaps that is why there have been so many passionate but brief relationships in her life. When Tony Richardson left her she said she wept \"not because he loved Jeanne Moreau, but because he didn't love me any more\", a reflection of her father's view that the good life is not necessarily monogamous. Subsequently she loved (and left or lost) Franco Nero (Lancelot in Camelot and father of her son Carlo), Timothy Dalton (who was Antony to her Cleopatra and receives eternal gratitude for having taught her to fish) and, most recently, David Harewood (now a television star) who played in the Antony and Cleopatra which she directed for the Moving The atre Company. Antony and Cleopatra is the play in which she seems to find all the excitement and mystery of the stage. And she uses it again and again to illustrate her theories of drama in general and Shakespeare in particular. </p> <p>She is didactic in a diffident sort of way. Over-modest about both her education and her intellect, she constantly emphasises what she has not read and does not understand. It is an endearing feature of her generally self-effacing off-stage character. </p> <p>Although she fills the stage, she has no wish to dominate a room and shows every sign of finding celebrity status tedious. But, reminded that she has spoken of \"the magic moment when you know what a play is about\", she is adamant (perhaps even vehement) that her performances match intuition and intellect. \"It's a synthesis. Always loads of work. Then the moment comes, because of the loads of work. It was like that with Antony and Cleopatra. Whenever I've played it, or directed it, we had to do masses of reading to get to grips with it.\" </p> <p>Her reading has reinforced the view that \"whoever Shakespeare was, he wasn't a little ordinary yeoman who headed back to Stratford after he had his fun\". Indeed, although she claims to be \"not really interested in 'what is called the controversy',\" she is sure that she knows who he was not. </p> <p>\"I'm quite certain that he was a quite exceptional aristocrat who had to keep totally quiet and needed Shakespeare as cover. It was a McCarthy-like period in England... Shakespeare wrote at a time of unprecedented tyranny and persecution... when he wrote 'alas England' the lines really came from thought and experience.\" </p> <p>Asked why she was so sure that the tortured soul who so often disguised his dissidence by basing his histories on texts which supported the Tudors's legitimacy, was an aristocrat rather than a commoner, she says: \"Simply because there were a number of aristocrats... it may have been Southampton... Or that other guy... A working man would not have had time... All the aristocrats, even the butchers, were extraordinarily well read and educated.\" </p> <p>Whatever her reasons for rejecting the contemporary evidence that Shakespeare came from humble origins, she has no doubts about the capabilities of the common man. Her political commitment is entirely genuine, if not altogether consistent: at the height of her revolutionary passion, she sent her daughter Natasha to St Paul's (public) school. </p> <p>But her constant support for radical causes is unrelated to a desire for either publicity or popularity. In 1964, pregnant with her first baby, she sang at the Wembley rally that launched Labour's general election campaign and then canvassed door to door in London's Barons Court constituency. All her campaigns turn into crusades. Her causes are always righteous and her beliefs invariably absolute. </p> <p> The Labour Party of the 60s and 70s, led by the determinedly pragmatic Harold Wilson, was never her natural political home. Nor was the Workers Revolutionary Party. For its intellectually violent approach to politics was at odds with her essentially gentle (if occasionally hyper-active) view of life. But in politics, as in the theatre, the woman whose dramatic genius is the product of instinct and emotion, always wanted to believe that what she achieved was the result of careful study. </p> <p>Corin, who had, for a time, been the full-time \"Yorkshire Organiser\" of the WRP, was able to answer all her questions about what causes the miseries of the world. \"I never met anybody else who could make a serious attempt to analyse and explain, from a historical point of view, contemporary events,\" she says. She was, \"drinking at the time and at a bit of a dead end\". But even now, recovered in every way and loosely attached to something called the Marxist Party, she remains touchingly loyal to her old comrades. The WRP collapsed in a flurry of allegations about Gerry Healey, its leader, who was expelled in 1985 for allegedly exploiting (indeed abusing) young female recruits. Redgrave is \"certain that the scandal was a put-up job\". </p> <p>It is her outright refusal even to acknowledge either the absurdity or the iniquity of the political extremists with whom she has been involved which made Peter Hall say that \"In life, which is true, she is false. In art, which is fake, she is true.\" That strange paradox is illustrated by her insistence that the British troops (sent into Derry in 1969 at the pleading of Bernadette Devlin) were dispatched to oppress the Republicans. </p> <p>Redgrave now says that her ideas of revolutionary politics (which have certainly softened with the years) were crystallised in her mind by the difficulty she found in persuading anyone to help in the defence of Dolores Price, the young Irish Nationalist, when she was charged with terrorist crime. Price was jailed for life in 1973 for her part in three London bombings which injured hundreds. </p> <p>There seems to be a filter in Redgrave's brain which holds back facts inconvenient to her view of life, or at least allows her to interpret them in a way which confirms her prejudices. Cato Street, Robert Shaw's play about an early 19th century wrongful conviction, led her to suspect that Price and her associates had probably been framed. </p> <p>More often than not she has avoided a collision between acting and politics, though Edward Fox says: \"All that business with Equity (the actors' trade union, which she tried to politicise) cannot have helped her career.\" And her acceptance speech, after she won her Oscar for the supporting role in Julia, included a recklessly heroic attack on the \"Zionist hoodlums\" who had campaigned against her because she had defended the Palestinian Arabs. No one doubts that that outburst prejudiced her prospects in Hollywood. </p> <p>\"Had it not been for that,\" says a close associate who refuses to be named, \"she might have become the biggest star of her time, as well as the greatest actress. As it is, her films have too often been character parts.\" Even her sister, Lynn Redgrave, grew briefly impatient with Vanessa's political reputation which, in the strange world of movie-making, rubbed off on her. But their reconciliation is complete. At the party in March to celebrate the Redgrave Archives' acquisition by the Theatre Museum, she was loud in her praise of both Vanessa's energy and acting. </p> <p>Occasionally, Vanessa Redgrave's political commitment has entirely creative consequences. Mark Rylance's idea that she should play Prospero is, at least in part, the result of his admiration for one of her qualities \"which impel her to rally for every cause which she believes defends the exploited and the oppressed - her strong sense of justice. Prospero is a man with immense power who is moved to mercy. Vanessa understands that.\" </p> <p>Rylance, it must be said, is as great an admirer of her dramatic technique as of her moral values. When he saw her in Noel Coward's Song At Twilight - her most recent West End appearance - he thought her so believable as Carlotta, the outraged ex-lover of an elderly, literary titan, that he thought \"she might walk off stage at any minute\". And that, he said, is typical of a style which reflects her personality. \"She is always on the edge.\" </p> <p>Sheridan Morley, who directed Song At Twilight, knows exactly what Rylance meant. Because he was Coward's literary executor, with a duty to do his best for both the author's reputation and his posthumous earnings, Morley wondered if, when the play transferred from the King's Head in Islington to the Gielgud in the West End, he should hand over to a director of greater experience. In the end, he accepted the advice that Redgrave is either undirectable or in no need of direction - \"she does something different every night\". Morley regarded his role as \"clearing a flight path so she could land in whatever way she chose\". </p> <p>He describes her as \"fearless\". Rylance speaks of her \"courage and absolute absence of self-consciousness\". And he regards her \"instant agreement to play Prospero at the Globe on a strange stage to a constantly visible audience\" as confirmation of her reckless daring. But he added \"innocence\" to his list of virtues - the best explanation possible for the often strange and sometimes troubling political causes which she has defended. </p> <p>Speculating about the roots of her extraordinary talent he referred to her as \"driven\"; then as \"being on the run\"; then as \"propelled\", adding that he did not know whether \"it is something behind her or something in front that keeps her dashing on\". </p> <p>Morley believes that personal history and political conviction often combine to give her an extra dimension. The second act speech in Song At Twilight - a celebrated but secret homosexual describing the trauma of constant deception - was, he believed, one of the reasons that she agreed to take over from Nyree Dawn Porter when the play moved to the West End. </p> <p>Perhaps Redgrave's genius can only be described in intangible generalities - veracity, sincerity, truth, courage - qualities which, by general consent, will keep her working into old age, \"two actresses in one\" as Morley describes her, \"Rosalind to the middle aged, and Stephen Fry's mother in Wilde to the young\". </p> <p>He regards the longevity as the final proof of her greatness. \"Evening Standard drama awards in four consecutive decades: 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. No one else has done that.\" But she is an extraordinary human being as well as a great actress: committed, compassionate and slightly crazy.

But I persuaded him to stand at the back of the theatre for a minute or two. On came Vanessa and he asked with proper Gallic enthusiasm, 'Oo is that girl?' He stayed for the rest of the play.\" Renoir was not the only director to be entranced by Rosalind. Tony Richardson, who had rejected Vanessa for a part in his film of Look Back In Anger, fell in love with her when he saw her in As You Like It. They were married in 1962 and the birth, in quick succession, of Natasha and Joely, now themselves internationally successful successful actors, meant that for three years motherhood took precedence over stage and screen. But in 1966, she came back with a succession of bangs - The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie on stage, and five films, including Morgan - A Suitable Case for Treatment, Blow-Up, and Camelot. Perhaps she worked so hard that year because she was unhappy. Tony Richardson, after three years of marriage, had fallen in love with Jeanne Moreau. Despite all Redgrave's attempts to rescue the marriage, including abandoning a \"cultural exchange\" delegation on its way to Moscow in the hope of convincing him that he was the centre of her life, they parted in Rome. Art imitated life. Richardson was directing a film in which Moreau starred, while his wife had only a small part. But, when Joshua Logan asked her to play Guinevere in Camelot, it was from her estranged husband that she sought advice. \"I was about to turn it down. But Tony said 'You'd be absolutely mad. If you do Camelot, everyone will want you to be in their films. If you don't, nobody will'. That's how it works. Because I did Camelot, I got offered almost everything that was going.\" To many of her warmest admirers, Redgrave seemed an unlikely (singing) Guinevere. And there have been other films, from Murder On The Orient Express to Yanks, which critics thought unworthy of her classical talents. She gamely defends every one, but explains that she does them \"so that I can do theatre\", where it is \"quite impossible to make a living. I'm going to start a year's work at Shakespeare's Globe followed by the National Theatre. It will all but ruin me. Films, often made when I need a holiday, make it possible. I get \u00a3400 a week at the Globe and \u00a3600 a week at the National. If I just relied on that, I couldn't pay the mortgage.\" And, as if to prove her point, 36 hours after the end of her long run in Noel Coward's Song At Twilight, she flew off to Canada for a week's filming before she began rehearsals of The Tempest, only pausing to take a couple of Chechen politicians to a lunch with sympathetic dons in Oxford, Chechnya being her current cause. An actress who has starred in so many films should not be short of money. But Eileen Atkins - perhaps Redgrave's closest friend and the woman she regards as \"probably the best actress in the world\" - says: \"She's given it all away. Swimming pools for schools. All sorts of things. She lives very humbly. Have you seen her flat? It's nothing very special. The films are what she lives on.\" Redgrave is not the woman to rest the justification of her dra matic decisions on anything as prosaic as the hope of fame and the need for money. If provoked, she will defend every film she made. \"I wanted to do Camelot because it was all about equality,\" adding, like the revelation of a new truth, \"they had a round table.\" Questions about King Arthur's status, and the life of the serfs outside the castle walls, do nothing to shake her theory about \"the one brief shining moment\". Her original theories about the parts she plays and the plays in which she performed have become the stuff of theatrical legend. Atkins has a fund of stories which illustrate the combination of absurdity and dramatic genius which marks the Redgrave approach to acting. \"In every new production she has about 50 original ideas: 49 are ludicrous and one is brilliant.\" During rehearsals for Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman at the National Theatre, \"she suddenly threw herself on the floor\". That was judged ridiculous. But then she started cutting in before Atkins had finished her lines. \"At first\", Atkins says \"I was irritated. Then we realised that it gave the whole scene the urgency which it lacked.\" Redgrave's ideas for improving Vita and Virginia - the letters of Mesdames Sackville-West and Wolfe, prepared for the stage by Atkins - were even more original. The problem of conveying the physical side of the characters' relationship \"without the unattractive sight of two middle-aged women kissing\" could, she told Atkins, be overcome by having two ropes hanging down on the stage, and the two lesbian lovers swinging out over the stalls to replicate their ecstasy. That was rejected. But her idea of conveying their constant partings by covering the furniture with sheets - an instantly recognisable image of desolation - \"added a new dimension\" to the show. Peter Hall recalls how, towards the end of rehearsals for Tennessee Williams's Orpheus Descending, Redgrave concluded that the spirit of the play could not be adequately conveyed by synthetic music and arrived one day carrying several mandolins. Hall resisted but, before the play transferred to Broadway, she began to take mandolin lessons in the hope of changing his mind. Hall believes that sensible directors rejoice in her obtrusive originality. \"A lot of actors hold back 10 or 20% at rehearsals. She's 100% all the time.\" The willingness to risk rejection and perhaps even ridicule is, Atkins says, proof of Redgrave's \"supreme self-confidence. She is braver than most actors, braver in general, not just brave on the stage. That makes her absolutely spontaneous. She has no feeling of fear that she is going to make a fool of herself.\" Atkins attributes the courage and confidence to her privileged, if unconventional, background - great actors enjoying great public acclaim as they privately endured the stress of con stantly shifting liaisons. It may also be responsible for one of her most endearing qualities. Redgrave is, she says, \"transparently vulnerable\". Perhaps that is why there have been so many passionate but brief relationships in her life. When Tony Richardson left her she said she wept \"not because he loved Jeanne Moreau, but because he didn't love me any more\", a reflection of her father's view that the good life is not necessarily monogamous. Subsequently she loved (and left or lost) Franco Nero (Lancelot in Camelot and father of her son Carlo), Timothy Dalton (who was Antony to her Cleopatra and receives eternal gratitude for having taught her to fish) and, most recently, David Harewood (now a television star) who played in the Antony and Cleopatra which she directed for the Moving The atre Company. Antony and Cleopatra is the play in which she seems to find all the excitement and mystery of the stage. And she uses it again and again to illustrate her theories of drama in general and Shakespeare in particular. She is didactic in a diffident sort of way. Over-modest about both her education and her intellect, she constantly emphasises what she has not read and does not understand. It is an endearing feature of her generally self-effacing off-stage character. Although she fills the stage, she has no wish to dominate a room and shows every sign of finding celebrity status tedious. But, reminded that she has spoken of \"the magic moment when you know what a play is about\", she is adamant (perhaps even vehement) that her performances match intuition and intellect. \"It's a synthesis. Always loads of work. Then the moment comes, because of the loads of work. It was like that with Antony and Cleopatra. Whenever I've played it, or directed it, we had to do masses of reading to get to grips with it.\" Her reading has reinforced the view that \"whoever Shakespeare was, he wasn't a little ordinary yeoman who headed back to Stratford after he had his fun\". Indeed, although she claims to be \"not really interested in 'what is called the controversy',\" she is sure that she knows who he was not. \"I'm quite certain that he was a quite exceptional aristocrat who had to keep totally quiet and needed Shakespeare as cover. It was a McCarthy-like period in England... Shakespeare wrote at a time of unprecedented tyranny and persecution... when he wrote 'alas England' the lines really came from thought and experience.\" Asked why she was so sure that the tortured soul who so often disguised his dissidence by basing his histories on texts which supported the Tudors's legitimacy, was an aristocrat rather than a commoner, she says: \"Simply because there were a number of aristocrats... it may have been Southampton... Or that other guy... A working man would not have had time... All the aristocrats, even the butchers, were extraordinarily well read and educated.\" Whatever her reasons for rejecting the contemporary evidence that Shakespeare came from humble origins, she has no doubts about the capabilities of the common man. Her political commitment is entirely genuine, if not altogether consistent: at the height of her revolutionary passion, she sent her daughter Natasha to St Paul's (public) school. But her constant support for radical causes is unrelated to a desire for either publicity or popularity. In 1964, pregnant with her first baby, she sang at the Wembley rally that launched Labour's general election campaign and then canvassed door to door in London's Barons Court constituency. All her campaigns turn into crusades. Her causes are always righteous and her beliefs invariably absolute. The Labour Party of the 60s and 70s, led by the determinedly pragmatic Harold Wilson, was never her natural political home. Nor was the Workers Revolutionary Party. For its intellectually violent approach to politics was at odds with her essentially gentle (if occasionally hyper-active) view of life. But in politics, as in the theatre, the woman whose dramatic genius is the product of instinct and emotion, always wanted to believe that what she achieved was the result of careful study. Corin, who had, for a time, been the full-time \"Yorkshire Organiser\" of the WRP, was able to answer all her questions about what causes the miseries of the world. \"I never met anybody else who could make a serious attempt to analyse and explain, from a historical point of view, contemporary events,\" she says. She was, \"drinking at the time and at a bit of a dead end\". But even now, recovered in every way and loosely attached to something called the Marxist Party, she remains touchingly loyal to her old comrades. The WRP collapsed in a flurry of allegations about Gerry Healey, its leader, who was expelled in 1985 for allegedly exploiting (indeed abusing) young female recruits. Redgrave is \"certain that the scandal was a put-up job\". It is her outright refusal even to acknowledge either the absurdity or the iniquity of the political extremists with whom she has been involved which made Peter Hall say that \"In life, which is true, she is false. In art, which is fake, she is true.\" That strange paradox is illustrated by her insistence that the British troops (sent into Derry in 1969 at the pleading of Bernadette Devlin) were dispatched to oppress the Republicans. Redgrave now says that her ideas of revolutionary politics (which have certainly softened with the years) were crystallised in her mind by the difficulty she found in persuading anyone to help in the defence of Dolores Price, the young Irish Nationalist, when she was charged with terrorist crime. Price was jailed for life in 1973 for her part in three London bombings which injured hundreds. There seems to be a filter in Redgrave's brain which holds back facts inconvenient to her view of life, or at least allows her to interpret them in a way which confirms her prejudices. Cato Street, Robert Shaw's play about an early 19th century wrongful conviction, led her to suspect that Price and her associates had probably been framed. More often than not she has avoided a collision between acting and politics, though Edward Fox says: \"All that business with Equity (the actors' trade union, which she tried to politicise) cannot have helped her career.\" And her acceptance speech, after she won her Oscar for the supporting role in Julia, included a recklessly heroic attack on the \"Zionist hoodlums\" who had campaigned against her because she had defended the Palestinian Arabs. No one doubts that that outburst prejudiced her prospects in Hollywood. \"Had it not been for that,\" says a close associate who refuses to be named, \"she might have become the biggest star of her time, as well as the greatest actress. As it is, her films have too often been character parts.\" Even her sister, Lynn Redgrave, grew briefly impatient with Vanessa's political reputation which, in the strange world of movie-making, rubbed off on her. But their reconciliation is complete. At the party in March to celebrate the Redgrave Archives' acquisition by the Theatre Museum, she was loud in her praise of both Vanessa's energy and acting. Occasionally, Vanessa Redgrave's political commitment has entirely creative consequences. Mark Rylance's idea that she should play Prospero is, at least in part, the result of his admiration for one of her qualities \"which impel her to rally for every cause which she believes defends the exploited and the oppressed - her strong sense of justice. Prospero is a man with immense power who is moved to mercy. Vanessa understands that.\" Rylance, it must be said, is as great an admirer of her dramatic technique as of her moral values. When he saw her in Noel Coward's Song At Twilight - her most recent West End appearance - he thought her so believable as Carlotta, the outraged ex-lover of an elderly, literary titan, that he thought \"she might walk off stage at any minute\". And that, he said, is typical of a style which reflects her personality. \"She is always on the edge.\" Sheridan Morley, who directed Song At Twilight, knows exactly what Rylance meant. Because he was Coward's literary executor, with a duty to do his best for both the author's reputation and his posthumous earnings, Morley wondered if, when the play transferred from the King's Head in Islington to the Gielgud in the West End, he should hand over to a director of greater experience. In the end, he accepted the advice that Redgrave is either undirectable or in no need of direction - \"she does something different every night\". Morley regarded his role as \"clearing a flight path so she could land in whatever way she chose\". He describes her as \"fearless\". Rylance speaks of her \"courage and absolute absence of self-consciousness\". And he regards her \"instant agreement to play Prospero at the Globe on a strange stage to a constantly visible audience\" as confirmation of her reckless daring. But he added \"innocence\" to his list of virtues - the best explanation possible for the often strange and sometimes troubling political causes which she has defended. Speculating about the roots of her extraordinary talent he referred to her as \"driven\"; then as \"being on the run\"; then as \"propelled\", adding that he did not know whether \"it is something behind her or something in front that keeps her dashing on\". Morley believes that personal history and political conviction often combine to give her an extra dimension. The second act speech in Song At Twilight - a celebrated but secret homosexual describing the trauma of constant deception - was, he believed, one of the reasons that she agreed to take over from Nyree Dawn Porter when the play moved to the West End. Perhaps Redgrave's genius can only be described in intangible generalities - veracity, sincerity, truth, courage - qualities which, by general consent, will keep her working into old age, \"two actresses in one\" as Morley describes her, \"Rosalind to the middle aged, and Stephen Fry's mother in Wilde to the young\". He regards the longevity as the final proof of her greatness. \"Evening Standard drama awards in four consecutive decades: 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. No one else has done that.\" But she is an extraordinary human being as well as a great actress: committed, compassionate and slightly crazy. The ballet's loss is the world's gain.

Pilaf 2 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil 4 whole cloves 4 cardamom pods 4 black peppercorns 1 bayleaf 1 medium-sized onion 340g basmati rice 1 tbsp ground coriander 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg 700ml chicken stock 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tbsp soft brown sugar 2 tbsp plump raisins 1 tbsp roasted slivered almonds Peel the onion and slice very thinly while heating a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Pour in the oil and fry the whole spices for 10 seconds. Now add the onion and fry until the onion colours and begins to char slightly. Add the rice, ground spices, sugar and stock. Stir well and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Let the pot simmer for 15 minutes, then add the raisins. Put the lid back on and cook for a further 15 minutes. Scoop out the rice on to a dish or tray and scatter the almonds over the top. Rice pudding I've never been able to prise out of Pa just how he makes his estimable rice pud, so here's Simon Hopkinson's recipe. It's delicious, and works every time. 100g unsalted butter 115g caster sugar 150g round-grain rice 1.5 litres very best creamy milk 1/2 vanilla pod, split lengthways 225ml double cream A pinch of salt Pre-heat the oven to 135C/275F/gas mark 1. Melt the butter in a flame-proof caserole, and add the sugar. Stir and heat gently until gooey, like toffee.
