      "body": "<p>It was once said of Bart King that he was the best known American of his time in England. When he came over to Britain, people would recognise him in the street and stop to shake his hand. Since King was a contemporary of Buffalo Bill and the Wright Brothers, this means that his fame must have been special. But what makes it extraordinary is that King was famous for being a cricketer - an American cricketer.</p> <p>Nowadays, as everyone knows, Americans don't play cricket. The surprise is that until well into the 20th century, they not only played cricket, but played it almost to test match standard. Until baseball overwhelmed it less than 100 years ago, cricket was America's most widely played team game. It thrived, especially in the Philadelphia area, where more than 120 clubs existed at various times. In 1905, more than 400 matches were played in Philadelphia in a single season. Almost all the players were American, and King was the best.</p> <p>On three occasions before the first world war, Philadelphia was strong enough to mount first-class tours of England - playing and beating county sides. There was talk of the US becoming the fourth test match-playing nation, although that prize went to the West Indies. As late as 1912, Philadelphia defeated an Australian test team by two runs. King, then 39, took nine for 78 in the match with his fast inswing. After two decades in the game he still reigned as Philadelphia's king of swing.</p> <p>Within a generation, cricket in the US had all but collapsed. One or two Wasp schools and colleges on the east coast continued to play. Touring sides occasionally crossed the Atlantic to play knockabout cricket at club level, as they still do today. In Hollywood, a team which boasted Errol Flynn as opening batsman and Boris Karloff as wicketkeeper, kept going into the 40s. But America's years as a cricket power were over, never to return.</p> <p>Yet the ghosts remain. As you drive out of Philadelphia along the road they call the Main Line, through exclusive Edwardian suburbs full of houses like those in which Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant lived in The Philadelphia Story, you reach the Merion Cricket Club. \"Merion CC - 1865\" is carved in the stone arch at the entrance.</p> <p>A vast and splendid pavilion still looks out on to a cricket field that is the equal of any in the world. Here, in 1906, King hit the highest score ever made in North America - 344 not out.</p> <p>Less than a mile away, at Haverford College, there is actually a Sunday afternoon match in progress on Cope Field, where cricket has been played since 1877. Tucked away in the college buildings is one of the most unexpected museums in the US, the CC Morris Cricket Library and Collection. Amar Singh, the library secretary, shows me some of his treasures, including the bat with which King made his great score, with which I play a few fantasy drives. There is a bat belonging to WG Grace, who played here in 1872 against \"22 of Philadelphia\" - WG took nine for 22 in the first innings and 13 for 45 in the second - and one donated by Sir Donald Bradman, who played here in 1932.</p> <p>There is a souvenir of Gary Sobers' visit to the revived Philadelphia Cricket Festival as a guest in 1999. There is as good a collection of cricket blazers as you could ever expect to see, including the natty Hollywood CC number. Karloff's wicket-keeping gloves are on their way here, too. And in another glass case are King souvenirs, including the key to room 166 from the Hotel Metropole in Folkestone, brought back from Philadelphia's first tour of England in 1897.</p> <p>King was the towering figure at the centre of Philadelphia's golden age of cricket. Statistics, beloved of cricket buffs, tell his story almost better than words. In his career, which lasted from 1892 to 1916, he took more than 2,000 wickets at an average of 10.47 runs each - a better average than any of his contemporaries in any country. In 1908, on his third tour to England, King topped the English bowling averages, the only American ever to do so. His 87 wick ets at a cost of 11.01 runs each remained the best figures for an English season until 1958. He was the first American to score a triple century - 315 for Belmont against Germantown in 1905 - and his 344 not out the following year remains the record.</p> <p>\"Without question the finest all-round cricketer ever produced in America,\" wrote his contemporary, John Lester. One of cricket's finest historians, Rowland Bowen, went even further: \"Certainly one of the six leading bowlers in the world of all time, and arguably the best.\" When King died, aged 91, in 1965, Wisden said his greatness was \"beyond question\". The Cricket Quarterly called him \"one of the greatest cricketers of all time\".</p> <p>Today, however, King is almost forgotten. His dates of birth and death are still reverently reprinted each year in Wisden, as are one or two of his records. But Philadelphia cricket has slipped into oblivion and King himself is all but unremembered in the city where he broke almost every record in US cricket.</p> <p>If there is one place in Philadelphia where a memorial to him would be appropriate, it is the corner of 49th Street and Chester Avenue. When I told a former Philly cop that I was planning to visit the site of the Belmont club ground, where King played most of his cricket, he looked at me and said: \"Sir, I would be very careful about doing that. Or, if you do, then go during daylight hours, keep your car doors locked and try not to draw attention to yourself.\"</p> <p>Maybe the officer was right. They have seen better days at 49th and Chester. But you can still visualise how what is now a baseball diamond and an overgrown basketball court in the heart of largely black inner-city West Philadelphia could once have been a cricket field lined with plane trees, with the number 13 tram rumbling past, then as now. And could the grass have been any greener then? I doubt it.</p> <p>It was on this grass that King performed the feat which, if he had done nothing else in cricket, would deserve to be remembered today for its brilliance. It took place in a match between Belmont and Trenton in 1901. Trenton, coming down from New Jersey, arrived without all their players, so Belmont put them in to bat, hoping that the latecomers would arrive in time to bat and that all 11 would be there by the time that Belmont began their reply.</p> <p>That afternoon, King was unplayable. His fast-bowling ripped through the Trenton order. Before long, the ninth Trenton wicket fell - King had taken every one. The final Trenton batsman, the captain of the team, had arrived by then. As he walked to the wicket, his side in disarray, he made a challenging remark to King about how the collapse would never have happened if the whole team had been there at the start, as they should have been.</p> <p>\"Bart looked the captain over with an appraising eye,\" Lester later recalled. \"Then he called the fielders over and sent them to the clubhouse.\" With that, King went back to the start of his run-up. When he turned to begin running in, King saw that Eddie Leech, the Belmont wicketkeeper was still in position. King called out to him. \"Why, Eddie, Eddie, whatever are you doing there? I won't need you, Eddie. Join the rest.\"</p> <p>As Leech departed, the Trenton captain lodged a protest. On the field there were now two batsmen, two umpires and King. The umpires consulted the laws. No, they decided, there was nothing that said a fielding side could not have fewer than 11 on the field - only that they could not have more. They waved play on. But now it was King's turn to hold things up. On second thoughts, he brought one fielder back, and positioned him 20 yards behind the wicket on the leg side. \"To pick up the ball after the game is over, and return it to the umpires,\" he explained.</p> <p>Finally, King ran in and bowled. It was the ball he always called his \"angler\", a fast inswinging yorker. It took the Trenton captain's leg stump, and the ball was deflected down the legside, coming to rest in front of the feet of the solitary Belmont fielder. King had taken 10 out of 10.</p> <p>His contemporaries had little doubt about King's prowess. \"The best swerver I ever saw in my life was J Barton King of Philadelphia,\" wrote CB Fry, the England captain. \"Mr King was a magnificent bowler, very fast, very accurate, and we remember at Philadelphia in 1901 being bowled by an unexpected inswinger which we left alone,\" wrote Eric Wilson, the Yorkshire and England batsman.</p> <p>To the end of his days, King remained the tall, thin, erect man who blew English county batting line-ups apart in the Golden Age. But there were few to remember him. One of the exceptions, although in the nick of time, was the Marylebone Cricket Club. In 1962, a mere 54 years after King last bowled on an English wicket, he was made an honorary life member of the MCC - the first and only American cricketer ever to be granted the accolade.</p> <p>In the 50s, as a student at Haverford College in the Philadelphia suburbs, Amar Singh remembers seeing a \"very tall, very gaunt\" old man who would come unannounced to watch college cricket on Cope's Field, where students still play to this day. \"He was an ardent supporter of the team. But not very talkative and very unassuming. He used to come to Haverfold regularly to watch us play. He sat on a chaise longue under the trees. We had no idea who he was. Now, of course, I just regret not questioning him about all his achievements.\"</p>",

He was the first American to score a triple century - 315 for Belmont against Germantown in 1905 - and his 344 not out the following year remains the record. \"Without question the finest all-round cricketer ever produced in America,\" wrote his contemporary, John Lester. One of cricket's finest historians, Rowland Bowen, went even further: \"Certainly one of the six leading bowlers in the world of all time, and arguably the best.\" When King died, aged 91, in 1965, Wisden said his greatness was \"beyond question\". The Cricket Quarterly called him \"one of the greatest cricketers of all time\". Today, however, King is almost forgotten. His dates of birth and death are still reverently reprinted each year in Wisden, as are one or two of his records. But Philadelphia cricket has slipped into oblivion and King himself is all but unremembered in the city where he broke almost every record in US cricket. If there is one place in Philadelphia where a memorial to him would be appropriate, it is the corner of 49th Street and Chester Avenue. When I told a former Philly cop that I was planning to visit the site of the Belmont club ground, where King played most of his cricket, he looked at me and said: \"Sir, I would be very careful about doing that. Or, if you do, then go during daylight hours, keep your car doors locked and try not to draw attention to yourself.\" Maybe the officer was right. They have seen better days at 49th and Chester. But you can still visualise how what is now a baseball diamond and an overgrown basketball court in the heart of largely black inner-city West Philadelphia could once have been a cricket field lined with plane trees, with the number 13 tram rumbling past, then as now. And could the grass have been any greener then? I doubt it. It was on this grass that King performed the feat which, if he had done nothing else in cricket, would deserve to be remembered today for its brilliance. It took place in a match between Belmont and Trenton in 1901. Trenton, coming down from New Jersey, arrived without all their players, so Belmont put them in to bat, hoping that the latecomers would arrive in time to bat and that all 11 would be there by the time that Belmont began their reply. That afternoon, King was unplayable. His fast-bowling ripped through the Trenton order. Before long, the ninth Trenton wicket fell - King had taken every one. The final Trenton batsman, the captain of the team, had arrived by then. As he walked to the wicket, his side in disarray, he made a challenging remark to King about how the collapse would never have happened if the whole team had been there at the start, as they should have been. \"Bart looked the captain over with an appraising eye,\" Lester later recalled. \"Then he called the fielders over and sent them to the clubhouse.\" With that, King went back to the start of his run-up. When he turned to begin running in, King saw that Eddie Leech, the Belmont wicketkeeper was still in position. King called out to him. \"Why, Eddie, Eddie, whatever are you doing there? I won't need you, Eddie. Join the rest.\" As Leech departed, the Trenton captain lodged a protest. On the field there were now two batsmen, two umpires and King. The umpires consulted the laws. No, they decided, there was nothing that said a fielding side could not have fewer than 11 on the field - only that they could not have more. They waved play on. But now it was King's turn to hold things up. On second thoughts, he brought one fielder back, and positioned him 20 yards behind the wicket on the leg side. \"To pick up the ball after the game is over, and return it to the umpires,\" he explained. Finally, King ran in and bowled. It was the ball he always called his \"angler\", a fast inswinging yorker. It took the Trenton captain's leg stump, and the ball was deflected down the legside, coming to rest in front of the feet of the solitary Belmont fielder. King had taken 10 out of 10. His contemporaries had little doubt about King's prowess. \"The best swerver I ever saw in my life was J Barton King of Philadelphia,\" wrote CB Fry, the England captain. \"Mr King was a magnificent bowler, very fast, very accurate, and we remember at Philadelphia in 1901 being bowled by an unexpected inswinger which we left alone,\" wrote Eric Wilson, the Yorkshire and England batsman. To the end of his days, King remained the tall, thin, erect man who blew English county batting line-ups apart in the Golden Age. But there were few to remember him. One of the exceptions, although in the nick of time, was the Marylebone Cricket Club. In 1962, a mere 54 years after King last bowled on an English wicket, he was made an honorary life member of the MCC - the first and only American cricketer ever to be granted the accolade. In the 50s, as a student at Haverford College in the Philadelphia suburbs, Amar Singh remembers seeing a \"very tall, very gaunt\" old man who would come unannounced to watch college cricket on Cope's Field, where students still play to this day. \"He was an ardent supporter of the team. But not very talkative and very unassuming. He used to come to Haverfold regularly to watch us play. He sat on a chaise longue under the trees. We had no idea who he was. Now, of course, I just regret not questioning him about all his achievements.\"",

Girobank contributed \u00a336m of its \u00a3252m of pre-tax profits in the first six months of the year. </p> <p>Girobank, the former Post Office bank which A&amp;L has owned since 1990, has the exclusive arrangement to handle business banking through post offices, much to the frustation of other major contenders such as Lloyds TSB and Barclays. </p> <p>City sources believe Woolwich and A&amp;L might be in the next wave of consolidation in the sector which has long been predicted and increasingly expected to build up in the coming months. </p> <p>Both banks are protected against hostile bids for another two years under the terms of their conversion from building societies three years ago. </p> <p>This does not prevent them entering into \"agreed\" deals, however, and if either did accept a friendly merger another bidder would then be free to launch a rival offer. </p> <p>Woolwich, in particular, has been regarded as being likely to attract a range of interest given its perceived advances on the internet through its Open Plan, current account cum mortgage service. </p> <p>Both Woolwich and A&amp;L, like the other building societies which converted at the same time, are struggling with shares below their flotation levels. </p> <p>Shares in Woolwich, boosted by intense takeover specuation in recent days, ended last night at \u00a32.69, almost \u00a31 below their flotation level. </p> <p>A&amp;L gained 11p to close at \u00a34.99, still well below the \u00a35.42 at which it entered the stock market. </p> <p>Unveiling an 8% fall in interim profits Woolwich chief executive John Stewart said that there \"was no point being silly about mergers\" and that he knew that the City believed the bank needed to get bigger. </p> <p>Since his remarks, Woolwich has been linked with Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and French insurance group Axa with which it has a marketing arrangement over its Open Plan account. </p> <p>Some sources linked Woolwich as a potential suitor for A&amp;L. </p> <p>One leading fund manager said: \"The negotiations over the Post Office could be painful for Alliance &amp; Leicester, so it has to be in the frame for the Woolwich\". </p> <p>Woolwich, however, is unlikely to try to negotiate a deal with A&amp;L after it apparently failed to reach a deal with its rival last year. There is concern that A&amp;L has planned to boost its share of the small business banking market by capitalising on its special relationship with the Post Office. </p> <p>The Post Office, while admitting that it is talking to other banks about ways to open up the network to business banking, has been careful to say that it wants to maintain its links with Girobank. </p> <p>An A&amp;L spokeswoman said: \"Alliance &amp; Leicester is not saying that the contractual relationship between the Post Office and Alliance &amp; Leicester will end.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A \u00a37bn bidding war loomed last night in Britain's banking sector as two of the best known names on the high street were cited as takeover targets. Woolwich, worth around \u00a34bn, is believed to have received a number of friendly takeover approaches from other banks since it opened the doors to potential suitors last week. Alliance &amp; Leicester was regarded as being vulnerable if rival banks are successful in ending an exclusive arrangement its Girobank arm has with the Post Office. Girobank contributed \u00a336m of its \u00a3252m of pre-tax profits in the first six months of the year. Girobank, the former Post Office bank which A&amp;L has owned since 1990, has the exclusive arrangement to handle business banking through post offices, much to the frustation of other major contenders such as Lloyds TSB and Barclays. City sources believe Woolwich and A&amp;L might be in the next wave of consolidation in the sector which has long been predicted and increasingly expected to build up in the coming months. Both banks are protected against hostile bids for another two years under the terms of their conversion from building societies three years ago. This does not prevent them entering into \"agreed\" deals, however, and if either did accept a friendly merger another bidder would then be free to launch a rival offer. Woolwich, in particular, has been regarded as being likely to attract a range of interest given its perceived advances on the internet through its Open Plan, current account cum mortgage service. Both Woolwich and A&amp;L, like the other building societies which converted at the same time, are struggling with shares below their flotation levels. Shares in Woolwich, boosted by intense takeover specuation in recent days, ended last night at \u00a32.69, almost \u00a31 below their flotation level. A&amp;L gained 11p to close at \u00a34.99, still well below the \u00a35.42 at which it entered the stock market. Unveiling an 8% fall in interim profits Woolwich chief executive John Stewart said that there \"was no point being silly about mergers\" and that he knew that the City believed the bank needed to get bigger. Since his remarks, Woolwich has been linked with Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and French insurance group Axa with which it has a marketing arrangement over its Open Plan account. Some sources linked Woolwich as a potential suitor for A&amp;L. One leading fund manager said: \"The negotiations over the Post Office could be painful for Alliance &amp; Leicester, so it has to be in the frame for the Woolwich\". Woolwich, however, is unlikely to try to negotiate a deal with A&amp;L after it apparently failed to reach a deal with its rival last year. There is concern that A&amp;L has planned to boost its share of the small business banking market by capitalising on its special relationship with the Post Office. The Post Office, while admitting that it is talking to other banks about ways to open up the network to business banking, has been careful to say that it wants to maintain its links with Girobank. An A&amp;L spokeswoman said: \"Alliance &amp; Leicester is not saying that the contractual relationship between the Post Office and Alliance &amp; Leicester will end.\"",

Hockney's designs, which have not dated, are brilliant in their witty use of the simplest resources - looking as though Hogarth might have drawn them himself, had he had only a few sheets of paper and some coloured ball-point pens. The characters, some intentionally more three-dimensional than others, move in a flat, false world of cardboard cut-outs, coloured with eye-boggling crosshatching. The opening of the second half is a theatrical-design coup, as effective as its concept is simple. </p> <p>The Rake's Progress, dealing with archetypes or cartoons rather than realistic characters, is perhaps too arch and too knowing to be instantly lovable. It needs snappy direction to make it work, and Cox's staging keeps hold of the audience, never allowing the pace to flag, although unfortunately the pauses between scenes were long enough to interrupt the flow. </p> <p>Even the greatest of productions would be lost without a good musical performance, and that is exactly what the opera received under Mark Elder, conducting the work for the first time. The London Philharmonic Orchestra gave a sparkling account of the score - crisp without being brittle. Richard Croft made an engaging Tom Rakewell, although some of his words got lost, while Rosemary Joshua, making her debut as Anne Truelove, sang with liquid tones and that rare thing, a truly controlled vibrato. She could perhaps aim for longer phrases, but as it was she communicated the naivety and goodness of Anne's character with ease. </p> <p>Also making his debut in his role was Gerald Finlay - and why nobody has hired him to sing Nick Shadow before is a mystery.

      "body": "<p>It's a funny old time, early pregnancy. You're not supposed to tell everyone why you are dragging yourself through the workday in a state of bone-vapourised exhaustion, why you are gagging at a colleague's innocuous air freshener, why you are irritably consuming mineral water at work social functions (I am ashamed to say I eventually snapped \"I'm in rehab\" to one innocent inquirer - sorry). </p> <p>Exactly how and when to break the news to your boss and colleagues can be perplexing, particularly as the weeks wax and your waistline also waxes (although always having a cake on your desk can be a plausible if pathetic alibi). </p> <p>Do you make an announcement after 12 weeks when the risk of miscarriage drops, or after the first scan, once strange movements are visible on the surface of your burgeoning \"beer belly\"? And what exactly do you say to your blokier male colleagues: \"By the way lads, I'm up the duff. Mine's not a lager\"? </p> <p>For some women, especially those in predominantly male workplaces, there can be a terrible sense of exposure. The private life you've always kept private is suddenly pushing out the front of your suits. There is no male equivalent. </p> <p>Julia, a 33-year-old former City high-flier, says: \"It was weird. I spent 10 years in the City pretending not to be a girl and then you're pregnant and you can't pretend any more. You're at a meeting talking about something to do with business, and someone's kicking you from the inside. And how do you feel businesslike in a tent dress and button-front tights?\" </p> <p>Julia's situation was made more difficult by the fact that she suffered from complications early in her pregnancy. \"I had to go to the hospital for an emergency scan, so I ended up telling my boss and the team at around eight weeks. They were all terribly chivalrous at first. I got sent expensive flowers. They were all lovely about it - or so I thought.\" </p> <p>Then Julia overheard the other members of her team on the phone, cutting her out of a deal. \"The awful thing was the next day one of them was talking to me, saying how great it was about the babies and offering me all this old baby gear.\" </p> <p>For other women, there are feelings of guilt - particularly for those who occupy an important position in a small company, or who know that her workmates are going to have to cover for her in her absence. Because the reality is that, whatever the law says, maternity can still be perceived as a major inconvenience - to the company and to other colleagues. And women are still brought up to care about inconveniencing other people. </p> <p>Anna, a marketing director for a design company, felt obliged to tell her (female) MD when she was only seven weeks pregnant because she'd just been given funds for a new project. Before she got the words out, her MD guessed. \"My MD said: 'Don't tell me, you're fucking pregnant.' I replied: 'This isn't quite how I was planning to tell you.' She turned to the chairman and said: 'Don't worry about me. I've been sterilised.' I burst into tears.\" </p> <p>Anna ultimately found herself \"restructured\" into a lesser role. She took voluntary redundancy and a modest payment, rather than fight it out in an employment tribunal a few months after the birth of her first baby. </p> <p>Although most employers these days probably realise that it is unlawful to penalise a woman for having a baby, some are probably cynical enough to rely on the reluctance of many women to embark on litigation at a time which is supposed to be joyful (not to mention exhausting). </p> <p>And ironically, the problems frequently arise with other women - the boss who feels her own plans for a baby are affected, the colleague who has fertility problems or has decided not to have children for career reasons and feels that women who do have children are somehow letting the side down. And in a society where those with jobs increasingly seem to feel overworked, overstressed and sleep-deprived, there may also be a feeling that the woman who is taking maternity leave or coming back on flexitime is getting an unfair break or increasing the burden on others. Some of this sentiment seems to be reflected in a recent Management Today survey in which numerous managers expressed their disgruntlement with \"family-friendly\" policies. </p> <p>Imperfect as things are, we are none the less a world away from the experiences of our mothers' generation. Tessa was a social worker in the 60s before the sex discrimination legislation was brought in. You didn't have to be pregnant to be written off at work, just being married would do. </p> <p>\"The first day I arrived at the office and sat in the duty room. The senior childcare officer introduced me as 'Mrs'. There were a lot of unmarried women of a certain age. A lot was made of the fact that I got on well with the babies and children. Eventually, a senior childcare officer took me aside and asked if I thought I would be better off at home having some children of my own since I was clearly so fond of them. I was always treated as temporary - it was assumed that I would not stay. Young unmarried women who joined later were put on a promotion track and were treated differently.\" </p> <p>Hopefully, many women these days find their experiences are similar to those of Nicola, who works in food technology for a major supermarket chain and whose employers seem to have done everything by the book. Her pregnancy has made no difference to her internal job move and her boss has encouraged her to work at her own pace, and cut down on travelling when she began to have problems with her blood pressure. </p> <p>Nicola finds that the pressure she feels comes from herself. She feels a sense of responsibility to her team, anxiety about how they will cope in her absence and unhappy that her health problems have meant that she cannot carry on exactly as normal: \"You feel disappointed in yourself.\" </p> <p>This is the paradox. Of course you are entitled to be treated the same as everyone else when you are pregnant, but you are not the same, and for many women the hardest part of all is moderating the demands they make on themselves. </p> <p>As for me, by the time I got round to telling my own colleagues, most of the women had noticed anyway. I like to think it was only because of the nose-dive my work wardrobe had taken - the sudden rash of gussets and smocking - but I'm probably fooling myself. No doubt it was really the bad temper, the avocado complexion and the snoozing at the desk which gave the game away. But I needn't have felt any trepidation about coming clean, because everyone was charming - I was inundated by offers of advice, frocks, changing mats. Enough to moisten the eyes of an already fat and hormonal person. </p> <p>And it was just as well I got it over with when I did, because the following week my belly did a weird trick, where it suddenly poked out dramatically like one of those poptop camper vans. Male colleagues shook their heads at it in bemusement: \"I just can't believe I didn't notice that...\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's a funny old time, early pregnancy. You're not supposed to tell everyone why you are dragging yourself through the workday in a state of bone-vapourised exhaustion, why you are gagging at a colleague's innocuous air freshener, why you are irritably consuming mineral water at work social functions (I am ashamed to say I eventually snapped \"I'm in rehab\" to one innocent inquirer - sorry). Exactly how and when to break the news to your boss and colleagues can be perplexing, particularly as the weeks wax and your waistline also waxes (although always having a cake on your desk can be a plausible if pathetic alibi). Do you make an announcement after 12 weeks when the risk of miscarriage drops, or after the first scan, once strange movements are visible on the surface of your burgeoning \"beer belly\"? And what exactly do you say to your blokier male colleagues: \"By the way lads, I'm up the duff. Mine's not a lager\"? For some women, especially those in predominantly male workplaces, there can be a terrible sense of exposure. The private life you've always kept private is suddenly pushing out the front of your suits. There is no male equivalent. Julia, a 33-year-old former City high-flier, says: \"It was weird. I spent 10 years in the City pretending not to be a girl and then you're pregnant and you can't pretend any more. You're at a meeting talking about something to do with business, and someone's kicking you from the inside. And how do you feel businesslike in a tent dress and button-front tights?\" Julia's situation was made more difficult by the fact that she suffered from complications early in her pregnancy. \"I had to go to the hospital for an emergency scan, so I ended up telling my boss and the team at around eight weeks. They were all terribly chivalrous at first. I got sent expensive flowers. They were all lovely about it - or so I thought.\" Then Julia overheard the other members of her team on the phone, cutting her out of a deal. \"The awful thing was the next day one of them was talking to me, saying how great it was about the babies and offering me all this old baby gear.\" For other women, there are feelings of guilt - particularly for those who occupy an important position in a small company, or who know that her workmates are going to have to cover for her in her absence. Because the reality is that, whatever the law says, maternity can still be perceived as a major inconvenience - to the company and to other colleagues. And women are still brought up to care about inconveniencing other people. Anna, a marketing director for a design company, felt obliged to tell her (female) MD when she was only seven weeks pregnant because she'd just been given funds for a new project. Before she got the words out, her MD guessed. \"My MD said: 'Don't tell me, you're fucking pregnant.' I replied: 'This isn't quite how I was planning to tell you.' She turned to the chairman and said: 'Don't worry about me. I've been sterilised.' I burst into tears.\" Anna ultimately found herself \"restructured\" into a lesser role. She took voluntary redundancy and a modest payment, rather than fight it out in an employment tribunal a few months after the birth of her first baby. Although most employers these days probably realise that it is unlawful to penalise a woman for having a baby, some are probably cynical enough to rely on the reluctance of many women to embark on litigation at a time which is supposed to be joyful (not to mention exhausting). And ironically, the problems frequently arise with other women - the boss who feels her own plans for a baby are affected, the colleague who has fertility problems or has decided not to have children for career reasons and feels that women who do have children are somehow letting the side down. And in a society where those with jobs increasingly seem to feel overworked, overstressed and sleep-deprived, there may also be a feeling that the woman who is taking maternity leave or coming back on flexitime is getting an unfair break or increasing the burden on others. Some of this sentiment seems to be reflected in a recent Management Today survey in which numerous managers expressed their disgruntlement with \"family-friendly\" policies. Imperfect as things are, we are none the less a world away from the experiences of our mothers' generation. Tessa was a social worker in the 60s before the sex discrimination legislation was brought in. You didn't have to be pregnant to be written off at work, just being married would do. \"The first day I arrived at the office and sat in the duty room. The senior childcare officer introduced me as 'Mrs'. There were a lot of unmarried women of a certain age. A lot was made of the fact that I got on well with the babies and children. Eventually, a senior childcare officer took me aside and asked if I thought I would be better off at home having some children of my own since I was clearly so fond of them. I was always treated as temporary - it was assumed that I would not stay. Young unmarried women who joined later were put on a promotion track and were treated differently.\" Hopefully, many women these days find their experiences are similar to those of Nicola, who works in food technology for a major supermarket chain and whose employers seem to have done everything by the book. Her pregnancy has made no difference to her internal job move and her boss has encouraged her to work at her own pace, and cut down on travelling when she began to have problems with her blood pressure. Nicola finds that the pressure she feels comes from herself. She feels a sense of responsibility to her team, anxiety about how they will cope in her absence and unhappy that her health problems have meant that she cannot carry on exactly as normal: \"You feel disappointed in yourself.\" This is the paradox. Of course you are entitled to be treated the same as everyone else when you are pregnant, but you are not the same, and for many women the hardest part of all is moderating the demands they make on themselves. As for me, by the time I got round to telling my own colleagues, most of the women had noticed anyway. I like to think it was only because of the nose-dive my work wardrobe had taken - the sudden rash of gussets and smocking - but I'm probably fooling myself. No doubt it was really the bad temper, the avocado complexion and the snoozing at the desk which gave the game away. But I needn't have felt any trepidation about coming clean, because everyone was charming - I was inundated by offers of advice, frocks, changing mats. Enough to moisten the eyes of an already fat and hormonal person. And it was just as well I got it over with when I did, because the following week my belly did a weird trick, where it suddenly poked out dramatically like one of those poptop camper vans. Male colleagues shook their heads at it in bemusement: \"I just can't believe I didn't notice that...\"",

      "body": "<p>A German academic fears a violent backlash from orthodox Muslims because of his \"blasphemous\" theory that the Koran has been changed and revised. Such a backlash is not to be taken lightly; the Salman Rushdie affair is a solemn reminder of the power of an angry Muslim community. After the author wrote his novel Satanic Verses, which was considered by Muslims to be blasphemous, a fatwa , or religious decree, was pronounced against him in 1989 that left him fearing for his life. Rushdie has only recently reappeared in public after nearly 10 years in hiding. </p> <p>According to Muslim belief, the Koran is the eternal, unaltered Word of God, which has remained the same for 14 centuries. </p> <p>But Dr Gerd R Puin, a renowned Islamicist at Saarland University, Germany, says it is not one single work that has survived unchanged through the centuries. It may include stories that were written before the prophet Mohammed began his ministry and which have subsequently been rewritten. </p> <p>Puin's conclusions have sparked angry reactions from orthodox Muslims. \"They've said I'm not really the scholar to make any remarks on these manuscripts,\" he said. </p> <p>The semitic philologist, who specialises in Arabic calligraphy and Koranic palaeography, has been studying Sa'na manuscripts, ancient versions of the Koran discovered in Sa'na, the capital of Yemen. </p> <p>So controversial are his findings that the Yemeni authorities have denied him further access to the manuscripts. </p> <p>He says they shed new light on the early development of the Koran as a book with a \"textual history\", which contradicts the fundamental Muslim belief that it is the unchanging Word of God. </p> <p>Any questioning of the authenticity of the Koranic text as the Word of God can expect a hostile reaction. The fatwa , or death sentence, was issued against Rushdie for hinting in Satanic Verses that the Koran may include verses from other sources - chiefly Satan. </p> <p>Academics offering radical interpretations of the Koran put their lives at risk. In 1990, Dr Nasr Abu Zaid, formerly a lecturer in Koranic Studies at Cairo University, provoked a national outcry in Egypt over his book The Concept of the Text. There were death threats from Muslim extremists, general public harassment, and in 1995 he was branded an apostate by Egypt's highest court. The court forced him to divorce his wife because under Islamic law, marriage between an apostate and a Muslim is forbidden. </p> <p>Zaid's proposal was arguably less radical than Puin's. Zaid's book argued that \"the Koran is a literary text, and the only way to understand, explain, and analyse it is through a literary approach\". A Muslim, Zaid remained in Egypt for a time to refute the apostasy charges, but fled with his wife to Holland in the face of increasing death threats. </p> <p>Puin believes that he will not receive the same reaction, because unlike Zaid or Rushdie he does not have a Muslim name. </p> <p>His claim that the Koran has changed since its supposed standardisation, and that pre-Islamic texts have crept in, would nonetheless be regarded as highly blasphemous by Muslims. He has not yet written a book on his radical findings, but says it is \"a goal to achieve\" in the near future. </p> <p>Dr Tarif Khalidi, lecturer in Islamic Studies at Cambridge University, warns that the book may generate a controversy similar to Satanic Verses. \"If Dr Puin's views are taken up and trumpeted in the media, and if you don't have many Muslims being rational about it, then all hell may break loose.\" </p> <p>Khalidi fears Muslims will not accept Puin's work on the Sa'na manuscripts as having been done with academic objectivity, but see it as a deliberate \"attack on the integrity of the Koranic text\". </p> <p>The manuscripts, thought to be the oldest surviving copies of the Koran, were discovered in the ancient Great Mosque of Sa'na in 1972, when the building was being restored after heavy rainfall, hidden in the loft in a bundle of old parchment and paper documents. They were nearly thrown away by the builders, but were spotted by Qadhi Isma'il al-Akwa, then president of the Yemeni Antiquities Authority, who saw their importance and sought international assistance to preserve and examine them. </p> <p>Al-Akwa managed to interest Puin, who was visiting Yemen for research purposes in 1979. Puin in turn persuaded the German government to organise and fund a restoration project. The restoration revealed that some of the parchment pages dated from the seventh and eighth centuries, the crucial first two centuries of Islam, from which very few manuscripts have survived. </p> <p>Until now, there were three ancient copies of the Koran. One copy in the Library of Tashkent in Uzbekistan, and another in the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul, Turkey, date from the eighth century. A copy preserved in the British Library in London, known as the Ma'il manuscript, dates from the late seventh century. But the Sa'na manuscripts are even older. Moreover, the Sa'na manuscripts are written in a script that originates from the Hijaz - the region of Arabia where the prophet Mohammed lived, which makes them not only the oldest to have survived, but one of the earliest copies of the Koran ever. </p> <p>Puin noticed minor textual variations, unconventional ordering of the chapters (surahs), as well as rare styles of orthography. Then he noticed that the sheets were palimpsests - manuscripts with versions written even earlier that had been washed off or erased. </p> <p>These findings led Dr Puin to assert that the Koran had undergone a textual evolution. In other words, the copy of the Koran that we have is not the one believed to have been revealed to the prophet. </p> <p>This is something that Muslims would find offensive.The idea that the Koran is the literal Word of God, unchanging and permanent, is crucial to Islam.The traditional Muslim view holds that the Koran was revealed to Mohammed by God in fragments between 610 and 632 AD. The revealed verses were \"recorded on palm leaves and flat stones and in the hearts of men [meaning memorised],\" and remained in this state during the prophet's lifetime. </p> <p>About 29 years after Mohammed's death during the rule of the third Muslim caliph, Uthman, a standard copy of the Koran in a book form, was made, because already divergent readings and copies were circulating in the growing Islamic empire. This Uthmanic recension, according to the Muslim view, was produced with meticulous care, based on earlier copies of the Koran made according to the instructions of the prophet. </p> <p>Orthodox Muslims insist that no changes have occurred to the Koran since the Uthmanic recension. But this view is challenged by the Sa'na manuscripts, which date from shortly after the Uthmanic recension. </p> <p>\"There are dialectal and phonetical variations that don't make any sense in the text\", says Puin. \"The Arabic script is very defective - even more so in the early stages of its literature.\" </p> <p>Like other early Arabic literature, the Sa'na Koran was written without any diacritical marks, vowel symbols or any guide to how it should be read, says Puin. \"The text was written so defectively that it can be read in a perfect way only if you have a strong oral tradition.\" The Sa'na text, just like other early Korans, was a guide to those who knew it already by memory, he says. Those that were unfamiliar with the Koran would read it differently because there were no diacritical and vowel symbols. </p> <p>As years went by, the correct reading of the Koran became less clear, he says. People made changes to make sense of the text. Puin gives as example Hajjaj bin Yusuf, governor of Iraq from 694-714 AD, who \"was proud of inserting more than 1,000 alifs [first letter of the Arabic alphabet] in the Koranic text\". </p> <p>Professor Allen Jones, lecturer in Koranic Studies at Oxford University, agrees. </p> <p>\"Hajjaj is also responsible for putting the diacritical marks in the Koran. His changes are a defining moment in the history of the Koran\". </p> <p>After Hajjaj's changes in around the 700s, \"the Koranic text became pretty stable\", he says. </p> <p>Puin accepts this up to a point, but says that certain words and pronunciations were standardised in the ninth century. He says the Uthmanic text was the skeleton upon which \"many layers of interpretation were added\" - causing the text to change. </p> <p>This is blasphemy, according to orthodox Muslims, and is not entirely accepted by other academics. </p> <p>Jones admits there have been \"trifling\" changes made to the Uthmanic recension. Khalidi says the traditional Muslim account of the Koran's development is still more or less true. \"I haven't yet seen anything to radically alter my view,\" he says. </p> <p>He believes that the Sa'na Koran could just be a bad copy that was being used by people to whom the Uthmanic text had not reached yet. \"It's not inconceivable that after the promulgation of the Uthmanic text, it took a long time to filter down.\" </p> <p>Puin's other radical theory is that pre-Islamic sources have entered the Koran. He argues that two tribes it mentions, As-Sahab-ar-Rass (Companions of the Well) and the As- Sahab-al-Aiqa (Companions of the Thorny Bushes) are not part of the Arab tradition, and the people of Mohammed's time certainly did not know about them. </p> <p>\"These are very unspecific names, whereas other tribes are specifically mentioned,\" said Dr Puin. </p> <p>His researches have shown that the ar-Rass lived in pre-Islamic Lebanon and the al-Aiqa in the Aswan region of Egypt around 150AD, according to the Atlas of Ptolemy. He argues that pre-Islamic sources entered the Koran, presumably when the growing Islamic empire came into contact with those regions and sources. </p> <p>Khalidi says finding pre-Islamic registers in the Koran does not discredit the Muslim belief in any way, because it does not threaten the integrity of the Koran. \"The Koran was revealed at a particular time in the vocabulary of the age\", he says. </p> <p>Puin also questions another sacred belief that Muslims hold about the Koran, that it was written in the purest Arabic. He has found many words of foreign origin in the text, including the word \"Koran\" itself. Muslim scholars explain the \"Koran\" to mean recitation, but Puin argues that it is actually derived from an Aramaic word, qariyun, meaning a lectionary of scripture portions appointed to be read at divine service. He says the Koran contains most of the biblical stories but in a shorter form and is \"a summary of the Bible to be read in service\". </p> <p>Orthodox Muslims have always held that the Koran is a scripture in its own right, and never a shortened version of the Bible, even if both texts contain the same prophetic tradition. </p> <p>Khalidi says he is weary of constant attempts by western Islamicists to analyse the Koran in a parallel way to the Bible.

      "bodyText": "A German academic fears a violent backlash from orthodox Muslims because of his \"blasphemous\" theory that the Koran has been changed and revised. Such a backlash is not to be taken lightly; the Salman Rushdie affair is a solemn reminder of the power of an angry Muslim community. After the author wrote his novel Satanic Verses, which was considered by Muslims to be blasphemous, a fatwa , or religious decree, was pronounced against him in 1989 that left him fearing for his life. Rushdie has only recently reappeared in public after nearly 10 years in hiding. According to Muslim belief, the Koran is the eternal, unaltered Word of God, which has remained the same for 14 centuries. But Dr Gerd R Puin, a renowned Islamicist at Saarland University, Germany, says it is not one single work that has survived unchanged through the centuries. It may include stories that were written before the prophet Mohammed began his ministry and which have subsequently been rewritten. Puin's conclusions have sparked angry reactions from orthodox Muslims. \"They've said I'm not really the scholar to make any remarks on these manuscripts,\" he said. The semitic philologist, who specialises in Arabic calligraphy and Koranic palaeography, has been studying Sa'na manuscripts, ancient versions of the Koran discovered in Sa'na, the capital of Yemen. So controversial are his findings that the Yemeni authorities have denied him further access to the manuscripts. He says they shed new light on the early development of the Koran as a book with a \"textual history\", which contradicts the fundamental Muslim belief that it is the unchanging Word of God. Any questioning of the authenticity of the Koranic text as the Word of God can expect a hostile reaction. The fatwa , or death sentence, was issued against Rushdie for hinting in Satanic Verses that the Koran may include verses from other sources - chiefly Satan. Academics offering radical interpretations of the Koran put their lives at risk. In 1990, Dr Nasr Abu Zaid, formerly a lecturer in Koranic Studies at Cairo University, provoked a national outcry in Egypt over his book The Concept of the Text. There were death threats from Muslim extremists, general public harassment, and in 1995 he was branded an apostate by Egypt's highest court. The court forced him to divorce his wife because under Islamic law, marriage between an apostate and a Muslim is forbidden. Zaid's proposal was arguably less radical than Puin's. Zaid's book argued that \"the Koran is a literary text, and the only way to understand, explain, and analyse it is through a literary approach\". A Muslim, Zaid remained in Egypt for a time to refute the apostasy charges, but fled with his wife to Holland in the face of increasing death threats. Puin believes that he will not receive the same reaction, because unlike Zaid or Rushdie he does not have a Muslim name. His claim that the Koran has changed since its supposed standardisation, and that pre-Islamic texts have crept in, would nonetheless be regarded as highly blasphemous by Muslims. He has not yet written a book on his radical findings, but says it is \"a goal to achieve\" in the near future. Dr Tarif Khalidi, lecturer in Islamic Studies at Cambridge University, warns that the book may generate a controversy similar to Satanic Verses. \"If Dr Puin's views are taken up and trumpeted in the media, and if you don't have many Muslims being rational about it, then all hell may break loose.\" Khalidi fears Muslims will not accept Puin's work on the Sa'na manuscripts as having been done with academic objectivity, but see it as a deliberate \"attack on the integrity of the Koranic text\". The manuscripts, thought to be the oldest surviving copies of the Koran, were discovered in the ancient Great Mosque of Sa'na in 1972, when the building was being restored after heavy rainfall, hidden in the loft in a bundle of old parchment and paper documents. They were nearly thrown away by the builders, but were spotted by Qadhi Isma'il al-Akwa, then president of the Yemeni Antiquities Authority, who saw their importance and sought international assistance to preserve and examine them. Al-Akwa managed to interest Puin, who was visiting Yemen for research purposes in 1979. Puin in turn persuaded the German government to organise and fund a restoration project. The restoration revealed that some of the parchment pages dated from the seventh and eighth centuries, the crucial first two centuries of Islam, from which very few manuscripts have survived. Until now, there were three ancient copies of the Koran. One copy in the Library of Tashkent in Uzbekistan, and another in the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul, Turkey, date from the eighth century. A copy preserved in the British Library in London, known as the Ma'il manuscript, dates from the late seventh century. But the Sa'na manuscripts are even older. Moreover, the Sa'na manuscripts are written in a script that originates from the Hijaz - the region of Arabia where the prophet Mohammed lived, which makes them not only the oldest to have survived, but one of the earliest copies of the Koran ever. Puin noticed minor textual variations, unconventional ordering of the chapters (surahs), as well as rare styles of orthography. Then he noticed that the sheets were palimpsests - manuscripts with versions written even earlier that had been washed off or erased. These findings led Dr Puin to assert that the Koran had undergone a textual evolution. In other words, the copy of the Koran that we have is not the one believed to have been revealed to the prophet. This is something that Muslims would find offensive.The idea that the Koran is the literal Word of God, unchanging and permanent, is crucial to Islam.The traditional Muslim view holds that the Koran was revealed to Mohammed by God in fragments between 610 and 632 AD. The revealed verses were \"recorded on palm leaves and flat stones and in the hearts of men [meaning memorised],\" and remained in this state during the prophet's lifetime. About 29 years after Mohammed's death during the rule of the third Muslim caliph, Uthman, a standard copy of the Koran in a book form, was made, because already divergent readings and copies were circulating in the growing Islamic empire. This Uthmanic recension, according to the Muslim view, was produced with meticulous care, based on earlier copies of the Koran made according to the instructions of the prophet. Orthodox Muslims insist that no changes have occurred to the Koran since the Uthmanic recension. But this view is challenged by the Sa'na manuscripts, which date from shortly after the Uthmanic recension. \"There are dialectal and phonetical variations that don't make any sense in the text\", says Puin. \"The Arabic script is very defective - even more so in the early stages of its literature.\" Like other early Arabic literature, the Sa'na Koran was written without any diacritical marks, vowel symbols or any guide to how it should be read, says Puin. \"The text was written so defectively that it can be read in a perfect way only if you have a strong oral tradition.\" The Sa'na text, just like other early Korans, was a guide to those who knew it already by memory, he says. Those that were unfamiliar with the Koran would read it differently because there were no diacritical and vowel symbols. As years went by, the correct reading of the Koran became less clear, he says. People made changes to make sense of the text. Puin gives as example Hajjaj bin Yusuf, governor of Iraq from 694-714 AD, who \"was proud of inserting more than 1,000 alifs [first letter of the Arabic alphabet] in the Koranic text\". Professor Allen Jones, lecturer in Koranic Studies at Oxford University, agrees. \"Hajjaj is also responsible for putting the diacritical marks in the Koran. His changes are a defining moment in the history of the Koran\". After Hajjaj's changes in around the 700s, \"the Koranic text became pretty stable\", he says. Puin accepts this up to a point, but says that certain words and pronunciations were standardised in the ninth century. He says the Uthmanic text was the skeleton upon which \"many layers of interpretation were added\" - causing the text to change. This is blasphemy, according to orthodox Muslims, and is not entirely accepted by other academics. Jones admits there have been \"trifling\" changes made to the Uthmanic recension. Khalidi says the traditional Muslim account of the Koran's development is still more or less true. \"I haven't yet seen anything to radically alter my view,\" he says. He believes that the Sa'na Koran could just be a bad copy that was being used by people to whom the Uthmanic text had not reached yet. \"It's not inconceivable that after the promulgation of the Uthmanic text, it took a long time to filter down.\" Puin's other radical theory is that pre-Islamic sources have entered the Koran. He argues that two tribes it mentions, As-Sahab-ar-Rass (Companions of the Well) and the As- Sahab-al-Aiqa (Companions of the Thorny Bushes) are not part of the Arab tradition, and the people of Mohammed's time certainly did not know about them. \"These are very unspecific names, whereas other tribes are specifically mentioned,\" said Dr Puin. His researches have shown that the ar-Rass lived in pre-Islamic Lebanon and the al-Aiqa in the Aswan region of Egypt around 150AD, according to the Atlas of Ptolemy. He argues that pre-Islamic sources entered the Koran, presumably when the growing Islamic empire came into contact with those regions and sources. Khalidi says finding pre-Islamic registers in the Koran does not discredit the Muslim belief in any way, because it does not threaten the integrity of the Koran. \"The Koran was revealed at a particular time in the vocabulary of the age\", he says. Puin also questions another sacred belief that Muslims hold about the Koran, that it was written in the purest Arabic. He has found many words of foreign origin in the text, including the word \"Koran\" itself. Muslim scholars explain the \"Koran\" to mean recitation, but Puin argues that it is actually derived from an Aramaic word, qariyun, meaning a lectionary of scripture portions appointed to be read at divine service. He says the Koran contains most of the biblical stories but in a shorter form and is \"a summary of the Bible to be read in service\". Orthodox Muslims have always held that the Koran is a scripture in its own right, and never a shortened version of the Bible, even if both texts contain the same prophetic tradition. Khalidi says he is weary of constant attempts by western Islamicists to analyse the Koran in a parallel way to the Bible. Puin, however, sees the need for a \"scientific text\" of the Koran, and this is what he intends to achieve. He says that Muslims believe that \"the Koran has been worked on a thousand years ago\" and \"is not a topic anymore\". Not all Muslim reaction to him has been hostile. Salim Abdullah, director of the German Islamic Archives, affiliated to the powerful pan-Islamic Muslim World League, has given him a positive response. \"He asked me if I could give him the permission to publish one of my articles on the Sa'na manuscripts\", said Puin. Warned of the possible controversy it could raise, he replied: \"I am longing for this kind of discussion on this topic.\"",

He also made himself a target for police surveillance. Yet it is now impossible to read his 1980s work without sensing his excitement at the discovery of freedom. Much of it is vehemently satirical, with a Rabelaisian glee to much of its language. I think, for example, of the imagined apparatchik who explains to the public \"that prices have a randy nature\", rising \"like furious Don Juans\" at the sight of queuing housewives, and I remember Petri's delighted grin when I compared him to Jonathan Swift.</p> <p>The political commitment in his poetry seemed to Petri \"a moral obligation\", and its logical consequence was involvement in the so-called democratic opposition. He wrote for its underground paper Beszelo, spoke at meetings, demonstrated in support of Poland's Solidarity and Czechoslovakia's Charter 77. When political parties were legalised, Petri joined the radically liberal Alliance Of Free Democrats, and campaigned in the 1990 election. But his delight was always in anarchy and dissent, and with the departure of communism, he lost his \"favourite toy\" - as he said in a recent poem.</p> <p>Petri had an almost medieval feeling for the omnipresence of death. When, in the summer of 1998, he learned that he had cancer of the larynx, he had an enemy grander than the state. His respect for that enemy, and his cool awareness of his responsibility for the grip it had on him, produced a poetry of memorable courage and clarity.\"It's time to die: I'm bored with the state of being. I'd welcome stomach-cancer or oedema of the lungs. My time on earth is duller than words can say; I've no taste for myself, though I still have some self-respect. I am clearing myself away.\"</p> <p>Petri tended to depict himself as a dissipated and world-weary bohemian, resigned to the narrow limits of human life. When I first met him in 1988, I was struck by how slight he seemed, as if shrunken and prematurely aged. Smoking and drinking incessantly, he never seemed to eat. Yet he was also charming, witty, considerate and courteous. There was a vitality to his swarthy features, and his talk was often wonderfully terse and acerbic. \"I was always ideologically suspect,\" he said to me. \"It began before I wrote my first political things.\" He touched his nose: \"The smell.\"</p> <p>He was married twice, though there were three other major lovers in his life, and he jokingly claims, in one poem, to remember 150 sexual partners. His poetry has been widely translated: two volumes have appeared in English, both published by Bloodaxe Books and translated by George Gomori and myself: Night Song Of The Personal Shadow (1991) and Eternal Monday (1999). The latter was shortlisted for this year's Weidenfeld translation prize.</p> <p>He is survived by his partner, Mari Pap, a daughter from his first marriage and a son from his second.</p> <p>Gyorgy Petri, poet, born December 22 1943; died July 16 2000</p>",

He also made himself a target for police surveillance. Yet it is now impossible to read his 1980s work without sensing his excitement at the discovery of freedom. Much of it is vehemently satirical, with a Rabelaisian glee to much of its language. I think, for example, of the imagined apparatchik who explains to the public \"that prices have a randy nature\", rising \"like furious Don Juans\" at the sight of queuing housewives, and I remember Petri's delighted grin when I compared him to Jonathan Swift. The political commitment in his poetry seemed to Petri \"a moral obligation\", and its logical consequence was involvement in the so-called democratic opposition. He wrote for its underground paper Beszelo, spoke at meetings, demonstrated in support of Poland's Solidarity and Czechoslovakia's Charter 77. When political parties were legalised, Petri joined the radically liberal Alliance Of Free Democrats, and campaigned in the 1990 election. But his delight was always in anarchy and dissent, and with the departure of communism, he lost his \"favourite toy\" - as he said in a recent poem. Petri had an almost medieval feeling for the omnipresence of death. When, in the summer of 1998, he learned that he had cancer of the larynx, he had an enemy grander than the state. His respect for that enemy, and his cool awareness of his responsibility for the grip it had on him, produced a poetry of memorable courage and clarity.\"It's time to die: I'm bored with the state of being. I'd welcome stomach-cancer or oedema of the lungs. My time on earth is duller than words can say; I've no taste for myself, though I still have some self-respect. I am clearing myself away.\" Petri tended to depict himself as a dissipated and world-weary bohemian, resigned to the narrow limits of human life. When I first met him in 1988, I was struck by how slight he seemed, as if shrunken and prematurely aged. Smoking and drinking incessantly, he never seemed to eat. Yet he was also charming, witty, considerate and courteous. There was a vitality to his swarthy features, and his talk was often wonderfully terse and acerbic. \"I was always ideologically suspect,\" he said to me. \"It began before I wrote my first political things.\" He touched his nose: \"The smell.\" He was married twice, though there were three other major lovers in his life, and he jokingly claims, in one poem, to remember 150 sexual partners. His poetry has been widely translated: two volumes have appeared in English, both published by Bloodaxe Books and translated by George Gomori and myself: Night Song Of The Personal Shadow (1991) and Eternal Monday (1999). The latter was shortlisted for this year's Weidenfeld translation prize. He is survived by his partner, Mari Pap, a daughter from his first marriage and a son from his second. Gyorgy Petri, poet, born December 22 1943; died July 16 2000",

      "bodyText": "Benito Carbone will fly into England today to finalise the details of a shock transfer to Bradford City that was billed by the club last night as \"the most exciting signing in our history\". After leaving Aston Villa in acrimonious circumstances last month Carbone is a free agent and Bradford have taken advantage of the apathetic reaction to his availability from Italy's Serie A to tempt him back to England. The controversial 28-year-old forward is due at Leeds/Bradford airport with his agent Giovanni Branchini by late morning, when they will be met by officials from the Yorkshire club and taken to Valley Parade for a medical. According to the Tykes' manager Chris Hutchings: \"This signing will raise a few eyebrows in the world of football.\" His sense of anticipation was shared by the Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond after a turbulent summer in which the club's ambition has been questioned following Paul Jewell's unexpected defection to Sheffield Wednesday. \"This will be seen by the supporters as the most exciting signing in the history of the club,\" Richmond predicted. After a build-up like that, Bradford's fans will no doubt be relieved that it is not Middlesbrough's Brian Deane - the subject of an unsuccessful bid last week - but Carbone who will be unveiled at a press conference scheduled for 11am tomorrow. At Wednesday the Italian was best remembered for a string of rows with the then manager Danny Wilson rather than the occasional flashes of brilliance he displayed on the field. The Villa manager John Gregory encountered similar problems upon signing him last season and finally ran out of patience with the former Internazionale forward after the club's offer of a new contract did not even merit an answer. Since then Carbone has spoken to Reggiana and Perugia but his status in Italy is such that he has not received a single offer. That Bradford are willing to meet his \u00a330,000-a-week demands - three times higher than their previous pay ceiling - speaks volumes for Richmond's determination to stay in the Premiership. Bradford have not given up hope of enticing Paulo Wanchope to the club from under the nose of Manchester City. Richmond is believed to have offered the West Ham striker improved terms yesterday and, contrary to some reports, Wanchope's future is still unclear after asking for the night to mull over his decision. Earlier the Maine Road manager Joe Royle claimed to have signed Wanchope for \u00a33.65m but last night the Manchester City spokesman Chris Bird said: \"Paulo has gone back to London to think things over and speak to his family in Costa Rica.\" West Ham cleared the way for Rio Ferdinand to join Barcelona yesterday after telling Leeds United that their \u00a315m offer for the England defender was a waste of time. Harry Redknapp insisted that he would not allow the 21-year-old to go to Elland Road, but the West Ham manager added: \"If a club like Barcelona came in it might be different, but they haven't made any contact. I am told they are prepared to offer us \u00a314m plus Winston Bogarde, but that doesn't make sense because I've already been offered the same player for less than \u00a31m. \"The truth is, though, that I don't want to lose Rio.\" Middlesbrough have received a work permit for the Croatian international striker Alen Boksic to complete his \u00a32.5m transfer from the Italian champions Lazio. The Aston Villa wing-back Mark Delaney will miss the start of the season after suffering medial knee ligament damage during Saturday's friendly at non-League Tamworth. The Welsh international could be on the sidelines for up to a month.",

This match contained some exceptional performances: Alec Stewart's vivid century on his 100th appearance matched by Brian Lara's immaculate effort on Sunday; Darren Gough's wonderful fast bowling in the first innings, and that from Walsh and Ambrose, which matched their own highest standards; Hussain's phenomenal catch to dismiss Ambrose and his instinctive run-out of Lara; Walsh's incredible slower ball first up to Graham Thorpe which so bamboozled the batsman on his return to Test cricket that he sat in the dressing room and laughed at the absurdity of it; and Trescothick's debut, which brought him 104 runs for once out and which, from an England perspective, was the most significant feature of the match. </p> <p>Trescothick was placed in the furnace again yesterday and survived intact, displaying the admirably unflappable temperament and solid technique that had brought him to notice in the triangular tournament. Perhaps that tournament came at the right time, allowing him to display his credentials in one-day games without fear of failure. Credit then to those who identified his potential and had the presence of mind to pick him. A part of the next generation appears to be in place. </p> <p>Yesterday when Walsh and Ambrose brought all the toys out of the box he was equal to the task and, with Atherton, made sure that there was no early breakthrough to give West Indies the sniff of a chance. Walsh finally snared Atherton, caught at the wicket for 28, to give him his 23rd wicket of the series and was urgently seeking his 24th when the draw was agreed. </p> <p>By and large, although they suffered as West Indies racked up 438 for seven in their second innings, it was a good, workmanlike performance from an England team that is growing in confidence match by match. The top six have a look of authority all the way down (although Hussain's miserable run of scores continues) and the pace bowling, led by Gough, has a classy look to it, even if Andy Caddick's capacity to wilt when under the cosh appears undiminished. </p> <p>The surprise package was Craig White, who bowled with genuine pace and skill, particularly when reverse-swinging the old ball to left-handers from around the wicket. The part he might play in Pakistan this winter, where reverse swing is a must, should not be underestimated. </p> <p>The disappointment was Robert Croft's offspin. Here he was presented with a pitch that turned and the pressure was on him to exploit it. He was expected to take wickets and figures of one for 124 from 47 overs do not indicate a success. </p> <p>There is little doubt that a spinner will be superfluous to requirements at Headingley, and a seventh batsman or all-rounder will come into the reckoning for that match, but the character of Oval pitches on which Saqlain Mushtaq and Ian Salisbury take so many wickets for Surrey has changed. England might well want two spinners there for the final Test, but will think long and hard as to whether Croft should be one of them. </p> <p>West Indies can take encouragement from the match. A little more than a month ago they were humiliated at Lord's, bowled out for 54 when they had the match under control, and their performances in the one-day tournament were less than adequate. </p> <p>But they fought back superbly here, not just through Lara's brilliance and that of Walsh and Ambrose, but through Jimmy Adams's diligence, and a return to something like form for Adrian Griffith. There was a statement of sorts too in the way that Wavell Hinds and then Lara pulled the short ball with gusto after the feeble attempts to cope with it at Lord's. </p> <p>The back-up bowling remains poor, however, with Reon King and Franklyn Rose appearing to have neither the skill nor the appetite to take over the mantle from Walsh and Ambrose.</p>",

The surprise package was Craig White, who bowled with genuine pace and skill, particularly when reverse-swinging the old ball to left-handers from around the wicket. The part he might play in Pakistan this winter, where reverse swing is a must, should not be underestimated. The disappointment was Robert Croft's offspin. Here he was presented with a pitch that turned and the pressure was on him to exploit it. He was expected to take wickets and figures of one for 124 from 47 overs do not indicate a success. There is little doubt that a spinner will be superfluous to requirements at Headingley, and a seventh batsman or all-rounder will come into the reckoning for that match, but the character of Oval pitches on which Saqlain Mushtaq and Ian Salisbury take so many wickets for Surrey has changed. England might well want two spinners there for the final Test, but will think long and hard as to whether Croft should be one of them. West Indies can take encouragement from the match. A little more than a month ago they were humiliated at Lord's, bowled out for 54 when they had the match under control, and their performances in the one-day tournament were less than adequate. But they fought back superbly here, not just through Lara's brilliance and that of Walsh and Ambrose, but through Jimmy Adams's diligence, and a return to something like form for Adrian Griffith. There was a statement of sorts too in the way that Wavell Hinds and then Lara pulled the short ball with gusto after the feeble attempts to cope with it at Lord's. The back-up bowling remains poor, however, with Reon King and Franklyn Rose appearing to have neither the skill nor the appetite to take over the mantle from Walsh and Ambrose.",

      "byline": "Lee Elliot Major",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The School of East Asian Studies at Sheffield University increased its rating from 2 to 3A in the 1996 Research Assessment Exercise. Over five years, the school would earn approximately \u00a3890,000 of public funds on the back of the result. Had it remained at a rating of 2, there would have been no money at all. </p> <p>But allegations and documents received by the Guardian suggest that the school's success was secured outside the rules of the exercise. Research papers were submitted to the exercise which had neither been published nor even completed. And when referees later requested copies, the papers were put together - six months after the deadline for submissions. </p> <p>There is evidence that this is just the tip of the iceberg - that there is systematic cheating by academics in the exercise, which allocates about \u00a31bn of government money each year. Ineligible books written before and after the assessment period are listed; books only edited by academics are listed as authored research; and publications which are merely reprints of other work are included in submissions. This happens in hundreds of academic submissions. And the result is always the same: the \"errors\" improve the chances of higher research ratings and more money. </p> <p>In 1993 Professor Ian Gow was poached by Sheffield University to head the School of East Asian Studies. At the time, he was deputy principal at Stirling University as well as acting head of Stirling's school of management. He had all the academic and managerial credentials to help turn around an under-performing research department. </p> <p>A man with an impeccable academic record, Gow has held several posts on senior research council steering committees for Chinese, Japanese and East Asian studies, his research specialities. He is also a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and one of a select bunch of advisors chosen for the Cabinet Office Pacific Asia science and technology committee. </p> <p>At Sheffield a critical element of Gow's brief was to bolster research, lift the research rating of the school and reduce, or remove, the departmental funding deficit. In 1995 Gow became pro-vice-chancellor at the university, second in command only to the vice-chancellor, with responsibility for IT strategy, the library and regional relations. </p> <p>The school's new research strategy under the stewardship of Gow was made clear in its submission to the 1996 Research Assessment Exercise. The RAE, which determines departmental research ratings, and funding council research grants for five years, represented a key milestone for the school. Ratings, which range from one to the top five-star ranking, retain unrivalled kudos in academic circles, and are a major advantage when departments bid for external research grants, from industry, charities or government research councils. </p> <p>According to the submission, seen by the Guardian but not yet available for public scrutiny, the strategy represented \"a significant departure from previous RAE submissions\". Up to then the school had tended to subordinate research to teaching, had focused on a few narrow research areas, was overly reliant on research funds from specialist Asian foundations and \"had a poor research output, qualitatively and quantitatively\". </p> <p>The new strategy aimed to \"create, support and sustain a positive research culture\". This included: a broadening of research activities; the expansion of work carried out by PhD students; and the aim of dramatically increasing the numbers of publications in monographs and refereed journals. Three priority groups were identified: existing core staff, new young staff and research students. </p> <p>A key component of this new vibrant research culture at the school would be the production of an occasional papers series, based on seminars presented by staff of the department. </p> <p>While referees consider many criteria when deciding research ratings, research papers remain the primary measure of a department's research standing. There is also an accepted hierarchy of how significant publications are: single authored monographs, edited volumes where staff are editors or co-editors, and peer refereed journal articles or chapters in books all carry much more weight than occasional papers. Usually produced in-house, occasional papers carry far less academic credibility, since there is no guarantee that they have been subject to the same scrutiny by referees. </p> <p>Yet for the relatively lowly rated school, the occasional paper series came to assume a pivotal role in their RAE submission. In the end 14 occasional papers were submitted among 15 staff in the submission, contributing a quarter of all the publications entered for the assessment. A further eight in-house publications completed while academics were at other institutions were also submitted. </p> <p>According to the school's strategy, the series offered a way of enhancing the departmental research culture by encouraging younger staff to give seminars, write up the results as occasional papers, and revise them for submission to peer-refereed journals later on. Now director of Nottingham University's business school, Gow says: \"The purpose of the occasional paper series was primarily designed to ensure that young members of staff had an opportunity to publish papers in advance of possibly submitting to journals. Young members of staff are not expected to have a large number of articles.\" </p> <p>But the school's RAE submission shows that the papers were listed extensively by all academic staff - both senior and junior. The rules of the RAE stipulate that up to four publications can be submitted by each academic. But it is a widely held belief that referees will frown upon anyone with fewer than four publications, without good reason for this. </p> <p> Among senior staff using occasional papers to reach the quota of four submitted publications were Dr Marjorie Dryburgh, then deputy director of the school's East Asia research centre, and Gow, the chairman of the school. As series editor, Dryburgh was responsible for the production of the series in the run-up to the RAE deadline. Indeed, two papers submitted to the exercise were authored and presumably edited by Dryburgh herself. Later academic referees would criticise the over-reliance of the school's submission on in-house papers among senior staff. </p> <p>After the long nine-month wait for the submission to be assessed, the submission was shown to have been a huge success. In December, the higher education funding councils announced that the school had increased its rating from 2 to 3A. This meant that the school would receive research income of \u00a3178,000 a year (taken from official figures for 1998-99). Over the five years up to the 2001 RAE, the school would earn approximately \u00a3890,000 of public funds. The school would have received noth ing if it had remained at a rating of 2. </p> <p>But was the success achieved within the rules of the exercise? A number of disturbing anomalies in the occasional paper series, along with other university documents seen by the Guardian, cast serious doubts over the contents of the submission. And two independent academic sources at the University of Sheffield claim that Dryburgh and Gow cheated the exercise. </p> <p>No copies of one paper related to Korean Studies by Yong doo-Cho, for example, exist either within the department or in library holdings. And in some cases the dates of publication on the front of papers do not correspond with the printing dates on the back of the papers. For the occasional papers numbered 4 and 6, the dates of publication on the inside cover are February and March 1996, but printing dates on the back covers are May 1996. The occasional paper submitted by Gow, meanwhile, has no publication date on the inside cover. The back cover reveals a print date of September 1996 - six months after the deadline for papers to be published for the exercise. It is a detail that the referees appear to have overlooked. </p> <p>An order form dated September 25 1996 from Sheffield's finance department details a request from the school for the printing of 100 copies of occasional papers. The form is \"with reference to Ian Gow\", with payment to be made through departmental funds. Attached is an internal departmental order form, signed by Dryburgh and pp'd on Gow's behalf by his secretary, requesting an order for occasional papers through the print unit as a matter of urgency. </p> <p>Occasional papers must be forwarded to the British Library within one month of production to ensure that they are available to the public. Failure to do so contravenes Section 15 of the Copyright Act of 1911, and casts doubt on the legal status of the publications. In terms of the RAE deadline for submission (March 31, 1996), this means that occasional papers would have had to have been received by the British Library no later than the end of April 1996. The RAE guidelines stipulate that all submissions must be \"publicly available, assessable output\". Although referees do not require the physical submission of publications, these must be available for assessment either through libraries or, in the case of occasional papers, from the department concerned on request. </p> <p> The Legal Deposit Office of the British Library confirms the dates of receipt of the occasional papers as follows: no 2 - May 15 1996; nos 1, 3-12, 14-16 - September 10 1996; and no 13 (Gow's paper) May 17 1997. The implications are clear. None of the occasional papers submitted as part of the 1996 exercise appear to have had legal status. </p> <p>How can all this be explained? It is also known that in August 1996 referees requested to see all the school's publications relating to Korean Studies, including Cho's papers. In September 1996 the RAE panel also wrote to Gow requesting a copy of his occasional paper. </p> <p>Both Gow and Dryburgh categorically deny any allegations that they cheated in the exercise, or stretched the rules. Asked whether she had any knowledge of the alleged fraud, Dryburgh said no. She also stressed that she was not involved in the composition of the RAE submission. </p> <p>Gow said that he could not \"say there is any truth in that at all\". He added: \"I am quite sure that papers were written before the RAE [deadline], and they were in some occasional-paper format, but not final-paper format.\" He has also provided evidence that the paper submitted to the panel was based on an oral presentation of a scholarly paper at a conference in October 1995 - falling within the assessment period. </p> <p>But even this would still not be within the rules of the exercise. The rules are crystal clear for all academics: in-house publications are often published at a later date, often following further work, in books or journals; but for the assessment they may only be returned in the form in which they exist within the assessment period, irrespective of whether they have been accepted for publication in another form. If an earlier version of the Gow paper did in fact exist, why were 100 copies of a new version rapidly printed off in September 1996? </p> <p>Gow says that the paper was on a computer disk left with the university to process and publish in February 1996. But much later he discovered that the disk had been mislaid and the paper not published in the occasional series. And when the paper was printed in September 1996, he did not conceal the printing date. </p> <p>There is also doubt about whether a conference presentation would qualify for the assessment as a '\"publicly available\" document. According to the funding councils, in-house papers may have a more limited distribution than that of externally published works but must be distributed beyond the institution publishing them and available to the public, either by sale or free. Can this be said of Gow's conference presentation? </p> <p>The University of Sheffield has launched an internal inquiry into the allegations. \"The university is concerned to learn of allegations of irregularity in the 1996 Research Assessment Exercise return for Asian Studies... These are currently subject to an internal review,\" a statement said. In 1996, more than 900 staff entered the exercise in more than 40 subject areas. </p> <p>The Higher Education Funding Council for England says it will also carry out an investigation when it receives details of the case. \"Hefce has not received any information about these allegations. But if we do, then we will look into them as we do all such cases,\" said Bahram Bekhradnia, director of policy at the council. </p> <p>But there is evidence that this is far from an isolated case. One former eminent academic referee willing to speak on the record about the conduct of the exercise is Professor Hugh Berrington, who served as the chairman of the politics panel in the 1996 assessment. Over 10 years ago, Berrington uncovered serious \"mis-reporting\" in about a sixth of all submissions within politics. Inaccuracies could be classified into seven main categories: submitted books or publications actually written before the assessment period; submitted books or publications actually written after the assessment period; books submitted as authored by academics who in truth only edited them; co-authored publications submitted as single-authored works; simple reprints of books published before the review period; and books which did not make clear that they were later editions of books first published before the review period. </p> <p>\"The problem is much more widespread than they [the funding councils] would own to,\" says Berrington. \"And I think they were very reluctant to face up to it. It throws doubt on the validity of what is being done, but also to combat it properly may require a considerable investment of auditing resources.\" Berrington's broader concern is with other subjects whose panels simply weren't aware of the potential problems and assumed that all was in order. </p> <p>\"There's always a temptation for panels to take a relaxed view of items published after the deadline,\" he says. \"But what seems a commonsense tolerance will be grossly unfair on people who have kept to the rules. It's nonsense to have a competition where those who keep to the rules suffer more than those who don't. If you think that the deadline is too stringent, you change it for everyone.\" </p> <p>He says two helpful developments - making the publications data in submissions publicly available after the exercise, and requiring departments to produce any cited item within three days of a panel request - are already in place. \"If these do not work across the board, subject audits will be needed in 2005, but that would be expensive and time consuming. There's also a case for reducing the grading of highly inaccurate submissions. If the new measures are not effective in eliminating inaccuracy, the funding bodies should take these further steps.\" </p> <p>The funding councils are fully aware of some of this mis-reporting. The review of the conduct of the 1996 exercise revealed that in \"a small but significant number of cases, attempts to track down listed works ended in the discovery that the publication details in the submission were seriously defective or that the work was not published by the census date\". The councils concluded that the reason was likely to be genuine error rather than any stretching of the rules, or fraud. The review says: \"But, given the importance of this issue and the very high standards of accuracy expected in academic bibliographies, it remains open to question whether we should have taken a harder line here.\" </p> <p>Berrington has another unanswered question: \"If most of the errors are unintentional, why is it that 98% are boosting department grades?

      "bodyText": "The School of East Asian Studies at Sheffield University increased its rating from 2 to 3A in the 1996 Research Assessment Exercise. Over five years, the school would earn approximately \u00a3890,000 of public funds on the back of the result. Had it remained at a rating of 2, there would have been no money at all. But allegations and documents received by the Guardian suggest that the school's success was secured outside the rules of the exercise. Research papers were submitted to the exercise which had neither been published nor even completed. And when referees later requested copies, the papers were put together - six months after the deadline for submissions. There is evidence that this is just the tip of the iceberg - that there is systematic cheating by academics in the exercise, which allocates about \u00a31bn of government money each year. Ineligible books written before and after the assessment period are listed; books only edited by academics are listed as authored research; and publications which are merely reprints of other work are included in submissions. This happens in hundreds of academic submissions. And the result is always the same: the \"errors\" improve the chances of higher research ratings and more money. In 1993 Professor Ian Gow was poached by Sheffield University to head the School of East Asian Studies. At the time, he was deputy principal at Stirling University as well as acting head of Stirling's school of management. He had all the academic and managerial credentials to help turn around an under-performing research department. A man with an impeccable academic record, Gow has held several posts on senior research council steering committees for Chinese, Japanese and East Asian studies, his research specialities. He is also a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and one of a select bunch of advisors chosen for the Cabinet Office Pacific Asia science and technology committee. At Sheffield a critical element of Gow's brief was to bolster research, lift the research rating of the school and reduce, or remove, the departmental funding deficit. In 1995 Gow became pro-vice-chancellor at the university, second in command only to the vice-chancellor, with responsibility for IT strategy, the library and regional relations. The school's new research strategy under the stewardship of Gow was made clear in its submission to the 1996 Research Assessment Exercise. The RAE, which determines departmental research ratings, and funding council research grants for five years, represented a key milestone for the school. Ratings, which range from one to the top five-star ranking, retain unrivalled kudos in academic circles, and are a major advantage when departments bid for external research grants, from industry, charities or government research councils. According to the submission, seen by the Guardian but not yet available for public scrutiny, the strategy represented \"a significant departure from previous RAE submissions\". Up to then the school had tended to subordinate research to teaching, had focused on a few narrow research areas, was overly reliant on research funds from specialist Asian foundations and \"had a poor research output, qualitatively and quantitatively\". The new strategy aimed to \"create, support and sustain a positive research culture\". This included: a broadening of research activities; the expansion of work carried out by PhD students; and the aim of dramatically increasing the numbers of publications in monographs and refereed journals. Three priority groups were identified: existing core staff, new young staff and research students. A key component of this new vibrant research culture at the school would be the production of an occasional papers series, based on seminars presented by staff of the department. While referees consider many criteria when deciding research ratings, research papers remain the primary measure of a department's research standing. There is also an accepted hierarchy of how significant publications are: single authored monographs, edited volumes where staff are editors or co-editors, and peer refereed journal articles or chapters in books all carry much more weight than occasional papers. Usually produced in-house, occasional papers carry far less academic credibility, since there is no guarantee that they have been subject to the same scrutiny by referees. Yet for the relatively lowly rated school, the occasional paper series came to assume a pivotal role in their RAE submission. In the end 14 occasional papers were submitted among 15 staff in the submission, contributing a quarter of all the publications entered for the assessment. A further eight in-house publications completed while academics were at other institutions were also submitted. According to the school's strategy, the series offered a way of enhancing the departmental research culture by encouraging younger staff to give seminars, write up the results as occasional papers, and revise them for submission to peer-refereed journals later on. Now director of Nottingham University's business school, Gow says: \"The purpose of the occasional paper series was primarily designed to ensure that young members of staff had an opportunity to publish papers in advance of possibly submitting to journals. Young members of staff are not expected to have a large number of articles.\" But the school's RAE submission shows that the papers were listed extensively by all academic staff - both senior and junior. The rules of the RAE stipulate that up to four publications can be submitted by each academic. But it is a widely held belief that referees will frown upon anyone with fewer than four publications, without good reason for this. Among senior staff using occasional papers to reach the quota of four submitted publications were Dr Marjorie Dryburgh, then deputy director of the school's East Asia research centre, and Gow, the chairman of the school. As series editor, Dryburgh was responsible for the production of the series in the run-up to the RAE deadline. Indeed, two papers submitted to the exercise were authored and presumably edited by Dryburgh herself. Later academic referees would criticise the over-reliance of the school's submission on in-house papers among senior staff. After the long nine-month wait for the submission to be assessed, the submission was shown to have been a huge success. In December, the higher education funding councils announced that the school had increased its rating from 2 to 3A. This meant that the school would receive research income of \u00a3178,000 a year (taken from official figures for 1998-99). Over the five years up to the 2001 RAE, the school would earn approximately \u00a3890,000 of public funds. The school would have received noth ing if it had remained at a rating of 2. But was the success achieved within the rules of the exercise? A number of disturbing anomalies in the occasional paper series, along with other university documents seen by the Guardian, cast serious doubts over the contents of the submission. And two independent academic sources at the University of Sheffield claim that Dryburgh and Gow cheated the exercise. No copies of one paper related to Korean Studies by Yong doo-Cho, for example, exist either within the department or in library holdings. And in some cases the dates of publication on the front of papers do not correspond with the printing dates on the back of the papers. For the occasional papers numbered 4 and 6, the dates of publication on the inside cover are February and March 1996, but printing dates on the back covers are May 1996. The occasional paper submitted by Gow, meanwhile, has no publication date on the inside cover. The back cover reveals a print date of September 1996 - six months after the deadline for papers to be published for the exercise. It is a detail that the referees appear to have overlooked. An order form dated September 25 1996 from Sheffield's finance department details a request from the school for the printing of 100 copies of occasional papers. The form is \"with reference to Ian Gow\", with payment to be made through departmental funds. Attached is an internal departmental order form, signed by Dryburgh and pp'd on Gow's behalf by his secretary, requesting an order for occasional papers through the print unit as a matter of urgency. Occasional papers must be forwarded to the British Library within one month of production to ensure that they are available to the public. Failure to do so contravenes Section 15 of the Copyright Act of 1911, and casts doubt on the legal status of the publications. In terms of the RAE deadline for submission (March 31, 1996), this means that occasional papers would have had to have been received by the British Library no later than the end of April 1996. The RAE guidelines stipulate that all submissions must be \"publicly available, assessable output\". Although referees do not require the physical submission of publications, these must be available for assessment either through libraries or, in the case of occasional papers, from the department concerned on request. The Legal Deposit Office of the British Library confirms the dates of receipt of the occasional papers as follows: no 2 - May 15 1996; nos 1, 3-12, 14-16 - September 10 1996; and no 13 (Gow's paper) May 17 1997. The implications are clear. None of the occasional papers submitted as part of the 1996 exercise appear to have had legal status. How can all this be explained? It is also known that in August 1996 referees requested to see all the school's publications relating to Korean Studies, including Cho's papers. In September 1996 the RAE panel also wrote to Gow requesting a copy of his occasional paper. Both Gow and Dryburgh categorically deny any allegations that they cheated in the exercise, or stretched the rules. Asked whether she had any knowledge of the alleged fraud, Dryburgh said no. She also stressed that she was not involved in the composition of the RAE submission. Gow said that he could not \"say there is any truth in that at all\". He added: \"I am quite sure that papers were written before the RAE [deadline], and they were in some occasional-paper format, but not final-paper format.\" He has also provided evidence that the paper submitted to the panel was based on an oral presentation of a scholarly paper at a conference in October 1995 - falling within the assessment period. But even this would still not be within the rules of the exercise. The rules are crystal clear for all academics: in-house publications are often published at a later date, often following further work, in books or journals; but for the assessment they may only be returned in the form in which they exist within the assessment period, irrespective of whether they have been accepted for publication in another form. If an earlier version of the Gow paper did in fact exist, why were 100 copies of a new version rapidly printed off in September 1996? Gow says that the paper was on a computer disk left with the university to process and publish in February 1996. But much later he discovered that the disk had been mislaid and the paper not published in the occasional series. And when the paper was printed in September 1996, he did not conceal the printing date. There is also doubt about whether a conference presentation would qualify for the assessment as a '\"publicly available\" document. According to the funding councils, in-house papers may have a more limited distribution than that of externally published works but must be distributed beyond the institution publishing them and available to the public, either by sale or free. Can this be said of Gow's conference presentation? The University of Sheffield has launched an internal inquiry into the allegations. \"The university is concerned to learn of allegations of irregularity in the 1996 Research Assessment Exercise return for Asian Studies... These are currently subject to an internal review,\" a statement said. In 1996, more than 900 staff entered the exercise in more than 40 subject areas. The Higher Education Funding Council for England says it will also carry out an investigation when it receives details of the case. \"Hefce has not received any information about these allegations.

      "bodyText": "4.15pm, Update: Survivors of the French coach crash that killed a 15-year-old boy, spoke of their ordeal today as they returned home to Edinburgh and Essex. The boys from the 41st Edinburgh Boys Brigade, and their leaders, were taken off the plane at 2.30pm on to a waiting coach for an emotional reunion with their parents at an undisclosed venue near Edinburgh airport. At a press conference this afternoon, one of the survivors, Alan Meikle, said: \"Most people were asleep and were woken up by the impact.\" Mr Meikle made a plea for the family of Craig Norsworthy, who died in the crash, to be left alone to cope with their trauma. Later today, police will interview the man driving the coach at the time of the crash, which left 11 of the 48 people on board injured when it careered off a motorway and overturned early on Monday morning. The bus was carrying two parties - 21 children and six adults from the 41st Edinburgh Boys Brigade, and 19 children and two adults from Chadwell Heath Foundation School in Romford, Essex. They were all embarking on an eight-day adventure holiday in Correze, central France, with Herefordshire-based holiday company PGL. On Monday night, 13 of the Essex children, some with bandaged limbs, arrived at London's Heathrow airport with their teacher, leaving behind eight others who are still in hospital in France. One, Ross Buckmaster, has serious back injuries. All were reportedly wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash. Coach operator Rennies of Dunfermline confirmed that it was the first time that driver Adrian McDonald, who was injured in the crash, had driven a coach abroad. French authorities have launched a judicial review into the crash, which happened as the coach travelled south on the A71 motorway near the village of Vierzon in central France. French Transport minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said that he was \"very concerned\" that a number of coach crashes had taken place on French roads in recent weeks. Teacher Nicola Goggin, from Chadwell Heath Foundation School, arrived at Heathrow arrivals nursing a sprained knee. \"The first I knew about [the crash] was hearing a bang and realising that the coach was on its side,\" she said. \"I am happy to have brought 13 of the kids back with me, but our thoughts are with the four kids who are still out in France. The children have been through a hell of a lot today. They are bruised and battered - they need rest.\" Meanwhile, the parents of 15-year-old Craig, from Edinburgh, said of their son: \"He was a happy-go-lucky lad, a cheeky wee laddie in the best sense of the word. \"He had the cheekiest smile, the very same one that he had had since he was a baby.\" A Foreign Office emergency hotline is on 020-839 1010.",

In the US, where the role has been clearly defined (Doulas of North America is the main coordinating body - it has 2,800 members and offers training and certification), doulas are seen as a complement to midwifery services. As Debra Pascali-Bonaro, an American doula, explains: \"At moments when a woman in labour needs medical care, a doctor or midwife is busy providing medical support but a doula can offer emotional support to the woman.\" </p> <p>So, too, can your husband or partner, of course, but the idea is that your doula will be less emotionally involved, and her experience of childbirth will give added reassurance when you need it most. If you want a doula in Britain, you might try Top Notch Doulas, who select and train their women themselves. But agency prices will put them out of the range of most budgets (a Top Notch doula will cost you a \u00a3125 agency fee, \u00a3150 for the birth itself and \u00a310 per hour thereafter).

With four children of her own, Lilliana has firm opinions about childbirth: \"Women don't need help to give birth,\" she says. \"We just need peace and quiet and safety.\" She likens giving birth to making love. \"If you're cold, it doesn't work; if someone interrupts you, it doesn't work. You need to be somewhere that you feel safe, where no one is going to disturb you, where you have privacy, warmth, no bright lights.\" </p> <p>This sounds perfect if, like Michelle, your labour is straightforward, but what about foetal distress? Breech births? Complications? \"I don't mean the midwife shouldn't be there,\" Lilliana explains, \"or that you have to be at home.\" But even at hospital births she considers her role to be \"keeping everyone from disturbing the woman\". For safety's sake, she says, the midwife must be allowed in to monitor the baby - but she should not speak to the woman, or move her or disturb her unless she has to. Meanwhile, the husband or partner should sit silently in the room, or supportively outside it, depending on the woman's wishes. </p> <p>There are, of course, obvious dangers in placing so much trust in one individual. While Lilliana is clearly a sensible, well-informed woman there's always the possibility that you'll get a rogue doula - one, say, who advises you not to listen to your obstetrician, or who tells you your newborn's 39C (103F) fever is normal. </p> <p>\"This is why we want to get our doula training to a standard that the Royal College of Midwives supports,\" says Birtles. Top Notch Doulas turn trainees away if they are \"too bossy, or likely to impose their views, for instance on drugs, during labour, or infant vaccinations\". And they believe it is crucial that the doula herself has had a positive experience of giving birth. \"The last thing you need in a birthing room,\" says Birtles, \"is fear.\" </p> <p>Birth can be scary enough: pain, blood, hospitals, strangers. I'm certainly considering having a doula with me for the birth of my next baby.

      "body": "<p>It was not until I was 24, six years ago, that I was diagnosed, by a psychiatrist in New York, with Tourette syndrome (TS) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), TS's frequent - often more debilitating - partner in crime. Because of the way I look, and what most people know (or don't know, rather) about these conditions, you would never assign these labels to me unless you were told of them in advance. Even then I would probably be able to hide anything out of the ordinary and prevent you from believing the truth. After all, I've been doing just that - passing for normal - for most of my life. </p> <p>Before I was 10, my first tic appeared - a quick, firm head jerk that usually occurred in sets of two. For weeks, maybe longer, I was able to keep it a secret. Soon, however, the girls in my ballet class noticed it, then my sister, and finally - in spite of my best efforts to hide it from them - my parents, who promptly set up an appointment with my affable if geriatric paediatrician. As I sat in his familiar office, eyeing the full basket of candy on his desk and smiling prettily as my ears were checked for possible infection, inside I was as tightly wound as a turn-of-the-century timepiece, literally willing my body not to move. When the doctor handed me a cherry lollipop and reassured my mother that I was absolutely fine - \"perfectly normal\" - I smiled triumphantly and excused myself to use the ladies' room, where I jerked my head so severely, as a release from the pressure of keeping so still, that I heard a crack like a gunshot. </p> <p>After that first tic, I endured hundreds more, while increasing my ability to conceal them from the people around me, especially my father, whose shock at this development in his otherwise perfect child was nearly as great as my own. The truth is that even now, no one - not any member of my family, any friend, any colleague, my husband - has ever seen the full extent of my physical tics. I'm not sure I could catalogue them in their entirety myself. Over the past two decades I have jerked my head sideways to varying degrees, thrust my chin forward or drawn it into my neck, shifted my lower jaw from side to side or back and forth, rolled my eyes to the outer corners of their sockets, clicked my back teeth in patterns, clenched my hands in pulsating fists, flipped my hair out of my face until it was knotty, sniffed furtive little rabbit sniffs, cleared my throat in quiet little coughs, flexed my wrists up and out, and rotated my shoulder blades, as though I were trying to make them meet in the middle of my back. </p> <p>Although these outward manifestations of what is, in my opinion, largely an inward condition, caused me physical pain and embarrassment, what went on in my head was much harder to control, suppress or explain. Even before I developed tics, I counted to myself, off and on, throughout each day, always to six and back. Sixes were good, threes were bad; in fact, even numbers in general were - and remain - vastly preferable to odd ones. It is hard to explain the pervasive nature of this rule, which affected not just objects or words, but how I walked, talked, coughed, even thought. When I was under duress or overtired I would count ideas - after six in an hour I had to clear my head by repeating my name (A-my S Wil-en-sky - six syllables) until the hour was up, allowing me six more ideas. </p> <p>At around the age of 12, I became obsessed with death, with illness, and monitored my temperature and blood pressure in a notebook for years, although I was physically as healthy as a horse. I meticulously researched diseases, such as encephalitis and lymphoma, and often convinced myself I had the symptoms, such as a swollen brain or painful lymph nodes. I invented elaborate rituals, such as complicated counting patterns, to keep myself safe from my limitless fears. And also as a protective measure against unspecified disaster, I started to hoard. For years, I saved: movie ticket stubs, gum wrappers, fortunes from fortune cookies, pennies, paper clips, safety pins, toothpicks and receipts, even from purchases of less than a dollar. </p> <p>In short, I was a mess. In my teenage years it took me 10 minutes to get from our front door to my bedroom due to all my walking and touching rituals. I managed to fight my way through adolescence, hoping that I would wake up one morning free from the burden I called my \"habits\". It was not until I was in graduate school that I was able to confront the possibility that something diagnosable - maybe even treatable - was wrong with me. When I mustered up the courage to consult a psychiatrist, he shook my hand. \"Congratulations,\" he said, \"I'm amazed you waited this long.\" </p> <p>Tourette syndrome is not, as it is nearly always portrayed in the media, a \"swearing disease\". About 10% of sufferers have coprolalia, the clinical term for vocal tics; that means 90% are afflicted primarily with physical tics, like mine, to varying degrees of severity. Physical tics, a fact to which I am living testimony, can be easy to mask or diffuse. In fact, I have met dozens of men and women who were middle-aged or older before being diagnosed with TS. Many sufferers, like me, were diagnosed in their 20s, after the worst of the condition had manifested itself. </p> <p>In medical terms, TS is a chronic neurobiological disorder of the central nervous system caused by abnormalities in neuro transmitters - dopamine and serotonin - that control the body's movements by sending messages across gaps between nerve cells called synapses. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, also a neurobiological and not a psychological condition, causes its sufferers to perform a wide range of compulsions in order to negate the anxiety caused by various obsessions, such as mine with death. OCD is much more prevalent than TS as a distinct disorder but is found in the majority of those with TS as an integrated component. </p> <p>Once I was diagnosed, I began regular sessions with an expert and started on medication: haloperidol (Haldol), a tic-suppressor that blocks the dopamine receptors in the brain, for the Tourette's, and fluoxetine (Prozac), a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, for the OCD. I began behavioural therapy, where I chipped away, bit by tiny bit, at the obsessions and rituals that I now accepted had stolen hours every day. </p> <p>The behavioural therapy was like learning to read, or ride a bike: for months the whole enterprise seemed insurmountable and then suddenly, after a gum wrapper screwed up in the trash can here, a cup of iced coffee with five ice cubes there, a brick fell out of the dam, the dam crumbled and was swept away by the current, and shortly after I couldn't imagine why on earth I'd started saving gum wrappers in the first place. The drugs were less successful, although they had the desired effects - after a year on each I chose my familiar enemy over the strange and uncomfortable side effects. I still prefer an occasional ticcing bout to pervasive lethargy, although I will certainly consider the new generation of medications being developed when they come out, if I feel the need. </p> <p>Today, although some of the more deeply-ingrained tics and rituals do creep back in times of stress, I am largely free from the burdens they imposed for so long on my body and mind. As an adult, with a career, a husband, a social life, I savour the regained hours in each day, hours I used to spend, say, putting all the correspondence I had ever received - including notes - in chronological order. Overall, I feel amused by many of my former rules, much less beholden to the few that remain. Most of the time, I throw things away like anybody else: old magazines, empty boxes and bags, insignificant receipts. With age, as is usually the case with TS, my physical tics have lessened in intensity and reduced in frequency to an entirely manageable extent. Almost always now, waiting for the bus, sitting at a cafe, walking down the street, I not only look normal, I feel so. </p> <p>Although I never set out to become a spokesperson for TS and OCD, my memoir has made me one. At first, this made me extremely uncomfortable. I felt neither compelled nor equipped to speak for others, whose experiences in general and with these conditions may have been totally different from my own. But the responses I receive to my story are so unpredictable - and so often delightful - that I would not trade my journey for the world. Perhaps my favourite so far was that of my husband's 83-year-old grandmother, an upright, churchgoing lifelong midwesterner, who upon reading my book said to me, while giving me an enormous hug, \"Passing for normal, eh? That's what we're all doing, I suppose. Every last one of us.\" </p> <p>Passing for Normal by Amy Wilensky, published by Scribner at \u00a39.99, will be available from August 14.</p>",

Continuous use of antibiotic eardrops isn't a good idea - you may be allergic to the drops or may develop infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria or thrush. I'd stop the drops for a couple of weeks then ask your GP to take a swab from the ear canal to see what bugs are festering there and the best treatment to polish them off. If your problem clears up while you're on holiday away from the traffic, it will add weight to your theory, though there's no single test to prove it. If the problem persists, see an ENT surgeon. </p> <p><strong> A very male problem </strong></p> <p> <strong> Q When my son was nine he had two operations to bring down his undescended testicles.

Most specialists would advise the operation to bring down and fix the testicles in the scrotum at around two, if not before. Testicles that don't descend are more likely to be abnormal, which may imply problems in producing sperm later. Puberty, male characteristics and the ability to have a full sex life should not be jeopardised however. And huge advances in male fertility treatment should mean that even if fertility is impaired, he will hopefully be able to father children. Hormonal treatment is very rarely necessary.

By day 10, you should be knackered but happier. Postnatal depression (PND) is rarer and worse. It comes on about 4-6 weeks after the birth and can last 3-6 months. It makes you feel low, anxious about being alone, unable to cope, uninterested in everything, angry, guilty and troubled by ideas of harming the baby. Contrary to popu lar belief, it is not caused by hormonal levels. It may be linked to previous bad labour, so talk through any unresolved fears with your midwife or obstetrician. The more people you can rely on for psychological and practical support, the better. Counselling to talk about underlying depression may be useful and antidepressant drugs may be prescribed.

      "body": "<p>The high priests of globalisation meeting at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meeting in Prague next month will attract the same level of ferocity from anti-capitalist protesters as they did in Seattle last year. They will also further blur the distinction between political and economic refugees, ensuring that those who are ethnically discriminated against at home become economically marginalised abroad. </p> <p>For the distinction between political refugees and economic migrants is a bogus one - susceptible to different interpretations by different interests at different times. The west is quite happy to take in economic migrants if they are businessmen (with the requisite \u00a3250,000), professionals, or technologically-skilled. It welcomes the computer wizards of \"Silicon Valley\" of Bangalore but does not want the persecuted peoples of Sri Lanka or the Punjab. And it is these it terms economic migrants - with all its connotations of scrounging. </p> <p>The west does not need, as it did in the immediate postwar era, a pool of unskilled labour on its doorstep. As economies move from industrial capitalism into global capitalism, businesses move plants to find such workers. Where they cannot, they demand that their workers be temporary and cheap. And the rightless and the illegals fit the bill nicely. </p> <p>Ironically, it is also globalism, with its demand for free markets and unfettered conditions of trade, that is eroding the distinction all over the world between the economic and the political realm. The nation state, particularly in the third world and the erstwhile eastern bloc, is the agent of global capital. It is capital that decides what to produce where and what to grow where and how. And through its aid and development agencies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and international trade agreements (such as Gatt and Nafta) and institutions like the World Trade Organisation, it holds the poorer regimes in hock. </p> <p>It then insists that they accept austerity measures, through so-called structural adjustment programmes that dictate drastic cuts in public spending, to pull them back from bankruptcy. The result is pauperisation, the erosion of educational, social and welfare provisions, the end of training and enterprise.

      "bodyText": "The high priests of globalisation meeting at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meeting in Prague next month will attract the same level of ferocity from anti-capitalist protesters as they did in Seattle last year. They will also further blur the distinction between political and economic refugees, ensuring that those who are ethnically discriminated against at home become economically marginalised abroad. For the distinction between political refugees and economic migrants is a bogus one - susceptible to different interpretations by different interests at different times. The west is quite happy to take in economic migrants if they are businessmen (with the requisite \u00a3250,000), professionals, or technologically-skilled. It welcomes the computer wizards of \"Silicon Valley\" of Bangalore but does not want the persecuted peoples of Sri Lanka or the Punjab. And it is these it terms economic migrants - with all its connotations of scrounging. The west does not need, as it did in the immediate postwar era, a pool of unskilled labour on its doorstep. As economies move from industrial capitalism into global capitalism, businesses move plants to find such workers. Where they cannot, they demand that their workers be temporary and cheap. And the rightless and the illegals fit the bill nicely. Ironically, it is also globalism, with its demand for free markets and unfettered conditions of trade, that is eroding the distinction all over the world between the economic and the political realm. The nation state, particularly in the third world and the erstwhile eastern bloc, is the agent of global capital. It is capital that decides what to produce where and what to grow where and how. And through its aid and development agencies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and international trade agreements (such as Gatt and Nafta) and institutions like the World Trade Organisation, it holds the poorer regimes in hock. It then insists that they accept austerity measures, through so-called structural adjustment programmes that dictate drastic cuts in public spending, to pull them back from bankruptcy. The result is pauperisation, the erosion of educational, social and welfare provisions, the end of training and enterprise. It denies the possibility of indigenous growth or any hope for the future that is not tied up with foreign powers and foreign capital. Hence resistance to economic immiseration is inseparable from resistance to political persecution. The economic migrant is also the political refugee.

      "body": "<p>In that boisterous, artfully crusty way of his, Sir Robin Day would have chuckled to hear that his death was the lead item on the Six O'Clock News on Radio 4 and on many television news bulletins last night. </p> <p>\"It must be a slow news day,\" he would have muttered, and he would have been correct. A consummate news junkie, devouring newsprint, books, magazines and TV for nearly 50 professional years, he knew all too well how his trade worked. </p> <p>Despite his fame, he was a modest man who felt he had not achieved all that he might have. </p> <p>At least in part, the key may lie in a half-forgotten detail of his long career. In the general election of 1959 he stood for parliament in the Liberal interest at Hereford. In Harold Macmillan's 100-seat landslide he was beaten, by 17,763 votes to 10,185, by an Etonian farmer, David Gibson-Watt. </p> <p>In a long career Mr Gibson-Watt did not unduly draw attention to himself. Day, already well-known as \"a television news commentator and journalist\" (his description in the 1959 Times election guide), went on to become a household name, first at Panorama, later in his decade as the incomparable host of BBC TV's Question Time - a \"stop-gap\" programme which grabbed 7m viewers. </p> <p>And yet he would tell friends in his old age that he would have traded the lot to be \"the humblest of backbenchers\". He spent a lot of time in the Commons press gallery, more than modern Paxmans would do. It was another reason why politicians saw him as one of their own, despite the frequent on-camera rows. </p> <p>His romanticism may also explain the extrovert's bow tie, the booming voice, the bufferish exterior which, as with other shy men, covered inner insecurities and made them an asset. Within three years of joining ITN he was interviewing the likes of Egypt's Colonel Nasser and - a television first - grilling prime minister Harold Macmillan in 1958. </p> <p><strong> Growing up</strong><br> </p> <p> In fact Day symbolised the growing up of British television journalism, as countless colleagues and victims, including Margaret Thatcher and John Humphrys, acknowledged last night. ITN got off its knees with politicians and forced the BBC to follow suit. </p> <p>David Dimbleby, one of Day's successors at Panorama, just as Dimbleby's father, Richard, had preceded Day, said last night that Day combined \"a barrister's training, a theatrical instinct and an absolute belief in the right to know\". That is exactly right. </p> <p>Like Winston Churchill he realised early on the value of the trademark bow tie. In the ultimate thespian tribute, he was invited to appear with Des O'Connor and with Morecambe and Wise, all of whom he admired. </p> <p>Yet this was a deeply serious man who, in his autobiography, Grand Inquisitor, wrote that \"a television interview with a prime minister should be a constructive contribution to the democratic process, a dialogue which will clarify and illuminate\". </p> <p>That sounds less fun than it usually was. Day was magisterial (he did his homework very thoroughly) but he was also fun. \"Why should a man of your social position, charm and personality have to go to whores for sex,\" he asked Lord Lampton after the junior minister in Edward Heath's government was found to have bedded two prostitutes at once. Such questions were not asked on TV in the early 1970s, nor answered. Yet Lampton (wearing dark glasses) replied that most men would jump at the chance. </p> <p>One of Day's raised eyebrows or his lawyer's putdown remark was often enough to deflate most evasive ministers, as last night's celebrated clip of John Nott's walkout from a studio recalled. </p> <p>Why should viewers not believe a serving naval officer about defence cuts rather than \"a transient, here today and - if I may say so - gone tomorrow politician\", Day asked. As Nott, then defence secretary, swept out, Day could be heard saying: \"Thank you, Mr Nott.\" </p> <p>Politicians knew that he was box office. They liked and respected him, though in 1987 Mrs Thatcher put him in his place by referring to Sir Robin throughout as \"Mr Day\".

      "bodyText": "In that boisterous, artfully crusty way of his, Sir Robin Day would have chuckled to hear that his death was the lead item on the Six O'Clock News on Radio 4 and on many television news bulletins last night. \"It must be a slow news day,\" he would have muttered, and he would have been correct. A consummate news junkie, devouring newsprint, books, magazines and TV for nearly 50 professional years, he knew all too well how his trade worked. Despite his fame, he was a modest man who felt he had not achieved all that he might have. At least in part, the key may lie in a half-forgotten detail of his long career. In the general election of 1959 he stood for parliament in the Liberal interest at Hereford. In Harold Macmillan's 100-seat landslide he was beaten, by 17,763 votes to 10,185, by an Etonian farmer, David Gibson-Watt. In a long career Mr Gibson-Watt did not unduly draw attention to himself. Day, already well-known as \"a television news commentator and journalist\" (his description in the 1959 Times election guide), went on to become a household name, first at Panorama, later in his decade as the incomparable host of BBC TV's Question Time - a \"stop-gap\" programme which grabbed 7m viewers. And yet he would tell friends in his old age that he would have traded the lot to be \"the humblest of backbenchers\". He spent a lot of time in the Commons press gallery, more than modern Paxmans would do. It was another reason why politicians saw him as one of their own, despite the frequent on-camera rows. His romanticism may also explain the extrovert's bow tie, the booming voice, the bufferish exterior which, as with other shy men, covered inner insecurities and made them an asset. Within three years of joining ITN he was interviewing the likes of Egypt's Colonel Nasser and - a television first - grilling prime minister Harold Macmillan in 1958. Growing up In fact Day symbolised the growing up of British television journalism, as countless colleagues and victims, including Margaret Thatcher and John Humphrys, acknowledged last night. ITN got off its knees with politicians and forced the BBC to follow suit. David Dimbleby, one of Day's successors at Panorama, just as Dimbleby's father, Richard, had preceded Day, said last night that Day combined \"a barrister's training, a theatrical instinct and an absolute belief in the right to know\". That is exactly right. Like Winston Churchill he realised early on the value of the trademark bow tie. In the ultimate thespian tribute, he was invited to appear with Des O'Connor and with Morecambe and Wise, all of whom he admired. Yet this was a deeply serious man who, in his autobiography, Grand Inquisitor, wrote that \"a television interview with a prime minister should be a constructive contribution to the democratic process, a dialogue which will clarify and illuminate\". That sounds less fun than it usually was. Day was magisterial (he did his homework very thoroughly) but he was also fun. \"Why should a man of your social position, charm and personality have to go to whores for sex,\" he asked Lord Lampton after the junior minister in Edward Heath's government was found to have bedded two prostitutes at once. Such questions were not asked on TV in the early 1970s, nor answered. Yet Lampton (wearing dark glasses) replied that most men would jump at the chance. One of Day's raised eyebrows or his lawyer's putdown remark was often enough to deflate most evasive ministers, as last night's celebrated clip of John Nott's walkout from a studio recalled. Why should viewers not believe a serving naval officer about defence cuts rather than \"a transient, here today and - if I may say so - gone tomorrow politician\", Day asked. As Nott, then defence secretary, swept out, Day could be heard saying: \"Thank you, Mr Nott.\" Politicians knew that he was box office. They liked and respected him, though in 1987 Mrs Thatcher put him in his place by referring to Sir Robin throughout as \"Mr Day\". He could hand it out and, rather rarer, could take it too. Once when he asked Mrs Thatcher whether she intended to sack some ministers, she replied: \"You are going further than I wish to go.\" \"Well naturally, that's part of my job, prime minister,\" he replied. \"Yes indeed, it's part of my job to try to stop you,\" she countered. He could be charming to younger colleagues, though not always. \"What did you think?\" he asked one after a big interview. When the man said the subject appeared to say nothing new, Day retorted: \"Not the answers, you fool, the questions.\" With hindsight, the tragedy of his later life was the BBC's decision to replace him with a younger man, Peter Sissons, on Question Time in 1989 when Day was 66 and had a lot of mileage left in him.

He kept up with the law and read political biography avidly. Day grew more conservative as he grew older and, like most people in most professions, frequently expressed the view that television, and politics, were going to the dogs.

The caring, sharing nineties are only just over yet cricket appears to be suddenly embracing them. For a game once infamous for its gin-soaked misogynist administrators to be running only a decade behind the rest of the world is a sea-change of Hick-playing-calmly-at-a-Waqar-yorker proportions. It was less than four years ago that Michael Atherton banned wives and girlfriends from accompanying his players on England's (disastrous) tour of Zimbabwe. Since then, Jonty Rhodes has been let off South Africa's tour of India in order to spend some time with his new baby and Adrian Griffiths has been allowed home for a short break when his wife gave birth to his first child. And now this.</p> <p>Could it be that cricket administrators have at long last realised that cricketers are not machines. In the last few years they have been given physios, shrinks, reverends and cuddly coaches. Now it seems they are to be pushed into the arms of their families, in a last attempt to create more rounded individuals.</p> <p>The counties will tear their hair out at the removal of their key players, whom they had hoped to have back in time for key Championship-chasing, -promotion and -relegation battles, but the families of cricketers will be jumping for joy.

      "bodyText": "Last week the ECB announced that England's players would be given three weeks compulsory leave from the beginning of September. Not for extra coaching, or intensive physiotherapy, but for some officially prescribed TLC. As the ECB press release put it: \"This will enable these players to spend time with their families and friends after the demands of the summer season, whom they will not otherwise see until shortly before Christmas.\" What is happening? The caring, sharing nineties are only just over yet cricket appears to be suddenly embracing them. For a game once infamous for its gin-soaked misogynist administrators to be running only a decade behind the rest of the world is a sea-change of Hick-playing-calmly-at-a-Waqar-yorker proportions. It was less than four years ago that Michael Atherton banned wives and girlfriends from accompanying his players on England's (disastrous) tour of Zimbabwe. Since then, Jonty Rhodes has been let off South Africa's tour of India in order to spend some time with his new baby and Adrian Griffiths has been allowed home for a short break when his wife gave birth to his first child. And now this. Could it be that cricket administrators have at long last realised that cricketers are not machines. In the last few years they have been given physios, shrinks, reverends and cuddly coaches. Now it seems they are to be pushed into the arms of their families, in a last attempt to create more rounded individuals. The counties will tear their hair out at the removal of their key players, whom they had hoped to have back in time for key Championship-chasing, -promotion and -relegation battles, but the families of cricketers will be jumping for joy. The non-stop merry-go-round of the current international circuit means that many players cock only a passing snook to their roles as husbands, boyfriends, sons and fathers. Sportsmen have never had any great problems in attracting women. Successful, powerful, fit, tanned and with the sex appeal of the showman, they make a good notch on the bed post for any girl out for a good time. But now Simon Hughes, a former Middlesex bowler and cricket's answer to Nick Hornby, has called for cricketers to approach women in a more mature way.

Aged 34, the actor hid under a straggly wig and heavy prosthetics to give a barnstorming performance as the weaselly Fagin. But the role attracted controversy too. So potent was Guinness that Lean's film was immediately banned in both Israel and Egypt. Israel objected to what it perceived as the actor's anti-semitic portrait of Fagin. The Egyptian authorities, conversely, felt that Guinness had made him far too sympathetic.</p> <p><strong>Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) </strong><br> Robert Hamer's dark class-war comedy remains the film that effectively branded Guinness on the public consciousness. The nominal star was Dennis Price's impoverished heir, but Guinness stole the show: split into eight different roles as the collected members of the wealthy d'Ascoyne family. His turn as the posh suffragette who \"fell to earth in Berkeley Square\" occupies a niche on comic history, while the news that Robin Williams is currently planning a remake (in the Guinness role) amounts to a kind of cinematic sacrilege.</p> <p><strong>The Man in the White Suit (1951) </strong><br> Guinness took an altogether more subtle and restrained starring role in this keen Ealing outing from Alexander Mackendrick. He plays the lowly dishwasher at a textile-mill, whose brilliant new invention - a fabric that never needs washing - enrages his profiteering bosses. The film's gentle line in comedy masks a harsh attack on industrial corruption, if not the entire capitalist system.</p> <p><strong>The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) </strong><br> The Lavender Hill Mob cast Guinness alongside Stanley Holloway as a pair of underdog bullion robbers who plan the perfect crime. Like Oliver Twist, this expert, anarchic comedy found itself banned in various nations, including the then British-governed Rhodesia. Explaining the decision, Tory minister John Profumo (yes, that John Profumo) told the Commons that \"the film was declared unsuitable for African audiences because it contained scenes likely to encourage a disrespect for law and order\".</p> <p><strong>The Ladykillers (1955) </strong><br> The last great Ealing comedy found Guinness (beneath lank hair and behind buck-teeth) as the sleazy ringleader of a bunch of criminals lying low at the home of a innocent old dame (Katie Johnson). A huge hit on its release, the film prompted the Daily Express to claim that \"aside from Scotch whisky, Mr Alec Guinness is the best export to America we have got\".</p> <p><strong>Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) </strong><br> Guinness bagged an Oscar for his starring role in David Lean's peerless wartime spectacular; a picture that went on to become the year's biggest box-office hit and one of the most namechecked war movies of all time. \"Guinness etches an unforgettable portrait of the typical British army officer: strict, didactic and serene in his adherence to the book,\" wrote Variety.</p> <p><strong>Our Man in Havana (1960) </strong><br> Directed by Carol (The Third Man) from the story by Graham Greene, Our Man in Havana was a pungent Cold War satire, with Guinness as the vacuum-cleaner salesman in pre-Revolutionary Cuba turned mischief-making British spy. The tale's use of military blueprints foreshadowed the later Cuba missile crisis, while Guinness's role seemed to prefigure his acclaimed 80s turn as the spy Smiley on BBC TV.</p> <p><strong>Tunes of Glory (1960) </strong><br> It was originally intended for Guinness to play the role of the upstanding English officer who takes over a Highland regiment, and John Mills the drunken colonel who was already based there.

The film itself scooped the Best Picture Oscar and was hailed by Pauline Kael as \"one of the most tasteful and exciting of spectaculars\".</p> <p><strong>Star Wars (1977) </strong><br> Guinness would later dismiss his stint as Obi Wan on Star Wars as his most miserable movie experience, and claimed that he binned all the resulting fan-mail. But Lucas's intrepid space adventure showcased the ageing actor for a whole new generation and made him a multi-millionaire to boot - a share of the profits gained him an estimated \u00a3120m (\"divide that by 20 and you might be nearer the mark,\" said Guinness).

Mindful of the scientific and bureaucratic arrogance which deepened the BSE crisis, the committee added that there was no evidence they did not damage human health either, and mobile users - particularly children - should be cautious.

The following Friday, James Dean was dead, killed driving the car.\" Ernest Hemingway Filming Our Man in Havana later in the 1950s, he was at a tense dinner with two of life's great opposites, Ernest Hemingway and Noel Coward. Hemingway morosely took him aside, complaining: \"I can't bear another minute of Noel's inane chatter. If he wags that silly finger at me once more, I may hit him. I wouldn't kill Noel - just dust him up a little. Am I pissed?\" \"A little,\" Guinness replied. \"He laughed and gave me a hug\". From Blessings in Disguise, Hamish Hamilton, 1985 Sir John Gielgud Acting in Sir John Gielgud's King Lear at the Old Vic early in the second world war: \"John's grasp of public events was always rather tenuous. His heart, however, was in the right place. 'I feel so sorry', he once said, 'for those poor men sitting up there all day. They must be so cold'. He was pointing to the barrage balloons tethered over London\". Films \"The life of the theatre always suited my inclinations more than filming, but an element of success in films enabled me to provide for my wife, son and my mother in a moderately comfortable way. After a very impoverished period in my young manhood, this was important to me. \"Hunger and shoes worn down to their uppers leave a harsh mark and suspicion of the future and a determination that the experience will not be repeated\". Fame \"A few nights ago, leaving a London hotel where film stars often stay, I was astonished by the nice, chummy taxi driver, who sort of recognised my face, when he said, 'I'll leave the lights on in the back of the cab. I expect that's what you like'. \"I had a picture of myself, brightly illuminated, waving from side to side in a traffic jam, with bewildered passers-by asking each other, 'Who's the dotty old party all lit up?'. \"'Put out the light', I said, 'and then put out the light'. 'Whatever you say, guv'.\" From A Positively Last Appearance, Hamish Hamilton, 1999 Ageing \"A Valentine card in a tiny illiterate hand. Surely I can't have sent a card to myself. Now that Dr Alzheimer looks as if he may be extending a welcome tome I can no longer be sure of these things.\" (1995) Lord Olivier \"When I played Malvolio in a poor TV Twelfth Night, Larry came to the final runthrough ... Just before we went on air he said to me, 'Marvellous, old cock! I never realised Malvolio could be played as a bore'. Suchlike encouragements were part of his repertoire. Yet I was fond of him.\" (1996) From My Name Escapes Me - The Diary of a Retiring Actor",

      "bodyText": "A car bomb explosion in the Basque town of Zumaia killed one person today, a day after four suspected Basque terrorists died when their explosives-filled car blew up in Bilbao. Today's bomb went off around 12:20pm in an industrial park in Zumaia, a town 25 miles west of the coastal city of San Sebastian. The Europa Press news agency said the bomb had been attached to the underside of the victim's car. State radio identified him as Jose Maria Korta, head of a business federation in the Basque province of Guipuzcoa. It said he was a critic of the Basque separatist group Eta. The interior ministry of the Basque regional government said the victim had died but it did not name him. Until today's attack, Spanish authorities had blamed Eta for seven deaths in a wave of attacks since the group announced the end of a 14-month ceasefire in December. The blast came a day after four suspected members of Eta died when explosives they were handling in a car driving through Bilbao exploded. The Basque regional interior ministry said forensic work carried out on body parts found at the site of the Bilbao blast last night showed that all four victims in the Renault Clio were male. The vehicle exploded in the sparsely populated Bolueta area of the city shortly before 11pm local time as it approached an intersection. One of the victims is thought to be Paxti Rementeria, the reputed leader of Eta's extremely violent Vizcaya commando unit. Police found false identity papers with Rementeria's picture on them, the official said. Bilbao Mayor Inaki Azuna said the people killed in the car were \"terrorists; who belonged to Eta and had probably targeted \"some citizen or a building.\" Police said weapons were also found in the street, apparently blasted from the car. Eta, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, is suspected of killing some 800 people since it began a violent campaign in the late 1960s to carve an independent homeland out of Basque areas in northern Spain and south-west France. The recent spate of violence included the assassinations in July of a town councillor in the southern city of Malaga and a former senior government official in the Basque country.",

He is soon to have extensive surgery on both hands - unusually gnarled even for an ex-pro - to relieve an uncomfortable condition known as Du Petrens. This causes all his fingers to curl in, making it impossible to place his hand flat on a flat surface, and difficult to apply, say, shaving foam to his face. </p> <p> For years Agnew, 40, has suffered from swellings, bumps and lumps on his hands - a legacy of years of impact while fielding. \"It's not an uncommon condition,\" Agnew told me from Old Trafford yesterday. \"Bill Frindall lost a little finger through it, and David Gower suffers it quite badly. He's had his hands done several times.\" </p> <p>As it happens, England's unusual two-tour winter - Kenya and Pakistan in the autumn, and Sri Lanka early next year - will allow Agnew to have the problem fixed with little disruption to his BBC work. His left hand will be operated on next month, and will be out of action for six weeks (\"totally mummified\", as he puts it), forcing him to miss the trip to Kenya, but it will be in full working order in time for Pakistan; the other hand will be operated on at the turn of the year, ready for Sri Lanka. \"It's nothing serious,\" says Agnew, \"but it has to be done. Hopefully I'll go out to Sri Lanka a new man.\"</p> <p><strong>Why Paul Strang is the Zims' top earner this summer</strong></p> <p>Paul Strang may have cut an anonymous figure on Zimbabwe's tour of England, but he is earning more for his season's work than the regulars who carried the national banner through two Tests, the triangular series and countless other matches. </p> <p> The leg-spinner, who was only called up for the one-day internationals, has now returned to the Lancashire League club Haslingden, where he is earning a sum which must be viewed with envy by the likes of Murray Goodwin and Heath Streak. Each tourist received a basic fee widely reported as \u00a33,000, but probably nearer \u00a35,000, for the full three-month trip, which was disrupted by a bitter pay dispute with the Zimbabwe Cricket Union. </p> <p> Strang's contract as Haslingden's professional for the season is worth \u00a312,000-\u00a315,000. In addition he will have received an estimated \u00a31,500, plus small performance bonuses, for appearing in four ODIs (in which he took a mere four wickets at 35.5). Strang was also entitled to a share of the \u00a340,000 prizemoney Zimbabwe picked up for their four wins in the tournament. </p> <p> Furthermore, he continued to receive about half his usual salary from Haslingden during his seven weeks' absence on international duty. Under Strang's contract with the club, the \u00a3300-a-week cost of employing stand-in pros for the games he missed - Asif Mujtaba, Nik Chopra and Lancashire's Ian Austin all deputised - was deducted from his weekly pay cheque of between \u00a3550 and \u00a3680.</p> <p> The club, which was obliged under league rules to release Strang for international duty, has surprisingly few complaints about losing its overseas star. Ernie Taylor, cricket chairman, explains: \"We were amazed Paul was called up by Zimbabwe. He came with an injury and only took about 20 wickets at 23 in our first 10 games. Our keeper kept saying Paul would never get a job with Tony Blair because he didn't spin enough.\" </p> <p> Now that dressing-room joke may have to be dropped. \"Paul's come back a better player,\" says Taylor, \"and his tendinitis seems to have cleared up. He's benefited from more physio, and more net practice. I'm sure we'll see a different Paul Strang in the second half of the season.\"</p> <p> His return to the Haslingden side against Nelson on Sunday, July 30, suggested that the club's substantial investment may yet be rewarded. He took 2 for 14 in 10 overs and made 30 on a difficult pitch as Haslingden won by 10 runs. \"He bowled really well, \"says Taylor, \"and his innings was the backbone of our 115.\" </p> <p><strong>Recognition at last for one-cap Brown</strong></p> <p> Simon Brown, the Durham quick bowler best known for his solitary England cap, is to receive a more unusual honour. He has been awarded the first full-scale player benefit in Durham's short history as a first-class county. Next season, Durham's tenth in the Championship, county supporters will finally have an opportunity to show their appreciation of Brown's dedication and consistency. It's no surprise that it should have taken Durham a decade to honour a player in this way - benefits are generally granted after ten years' service - or that their choice should be Brown. </p> <p> He is the county's longest-serving player: a local lad, he began his career with Northamptonshire, returning to Durham for their last season as a minor county, 1991. He's been a key figure there ever since. Last summer, making a remarkable recovery from a knee operation, he became Durham's leading all-time wicket-taker, and 47 first-class wickets (at an average of 16) so far this season have lifted his career tally past 500. </p> <p> The decision to give Brown a benefit was approved recently by the club's board. \"Simon was the obvious candidate,\" says Tom Moffat, one of the directors. \"It's richly deserved. Time after time he's been the first player in the country to reach 50 first-class wickets. We feel he's been overlooked by the England selectors. We think he's the best left-arm quickie in the country - he genuinely swings the ball and gets top players out. And that's not just a Durham opinion.\" </p> <p> However Brown's benefit year is unlikely to be crowned by an England recall. Now 31, he managed only 2-138 in his one Test, the crushing defeat by Pakistan at Lord's in 1996, and with bowlers such as Alan Mullally and Alex Tudor unable to get a Test at the moment, it would probably require an injury crisis to trigger another call-up. </p> <p> At least Brown should be able to concentrate fully on his benefit, which looks set to yield a tax-free lump sum in excess of \u00a3150,000. After all, the low-key benefit granted to John Morris last season raised an estimated \u00a3100,000, even though he was not universally popular and was leaving the club for Nottinghamshire; and the 1998 testimonial for the then groundsman, Tom Flintoft, produced \u00a335,000. \"We don't have a benefit culture in this county,\" says Moffat, \"but Simon should do very well.

      "byline": "Mark Tran",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Traditionally, the word \"community\" conjures up village fairs or small groups of like-minded people getting together, but it has taken on quite a different meaning with the internet.</p> <p>It was not always this way. The first internet communities bore some relation to the original meaning of the word, formed by groups of scientists or people with shared interests, a world vividly and enthusiastically portrayed by Howard Rheingold in his classic 1993 book, The Virtual Community. Now \"community\" conjures up an image of commerce as much as of cosy fellowship.</p> <p>Go to any networking event, sooner or later someone with a new website or about to create one will utter the word like a mantra. Entrepreneurs harp on about community for several reasons. First, the larger the membership of an online community, the greater the number of advertisers attracted. Second, the community represents a mini mass-market for companies as the market becomes increasingly fragmented. </p> <p>With the advent of the internet, that hoary old chestnut, \"the customer is king\", becomes more of a reality. Customers can browse for bargains, making it difficult for a company to build up customer loyalty. The internet is a paradox: It creates a virtual global market yet fractures it into millions of pieces at the same time.</p> <p>Take Amazon.com. The online bookseller says it can ship to virtually any address around the globe, so the world is its oyster in a sense. The only problem is that other companies such as Barnes and Noble, its bricks and mortar rival, also sell books on the net. If Barnes and Noble offers better service and cheaper books, customers may desert Amazon with the speed of its tumbling share prices. Amazon's defence is to build up a sense of loyalty and community. </p> <p>In building up a community, Amazon also acquires data about customers. This data amounts to a valuable currency because the more a company knows about its clients, the better placed it is to offer them what they want, although it has to take care not to rile them over-eager marketing. Because of this database, Amazon can exploit the information to sell other products besides books, which is why it has branched into other areas such as tools and hardware, beauty products and electronics. Amazon is creating a virtual department store based on the relationships that have been developed through its client base. </p> <p>\"Amazon is more than just about selling books,\" says Gerard Davies, an internet consultant. \"It's about forming relationships and managing those relationships.\"</p> <p>The community thus is no longer a group of like-minded fellows, swapping jokes and recipes but a potential commercial nirvana to corporations. That is why entrepreneurs like Michael Zur-Szpiro, who has set up a site for home buyers and sellers called Mooov.com, harp on such much about community. The site - one of several devoted to the housing market - invites people to share their horror stories and runs stories about celebrities and their stories about moving.</p> <p>With the importance of communities, a whole new industry has cropped up around community building on the net. Amy Jo Kim, who has been building online communities for 10 years for companies like America Online and webzines, has written a useful guide for community builders. She sets down a number of fundamental principles, such as the importance of designing a site that can adapt to the changing needs of its members and of creating and maintaining feedback loops. </p> <p>\"Successful community building is a constant balancing act between the efforts of management (that's you) to plan, organise and run the space, and the ideas, suggestions and needs of your members,\" she writes. Other community gurus such as Cliff Figallo, part of the Futurize Now consulting group in San Francisco, also stress the importance of listening to community members. </p> <p>But as desirable as it is for companies to build or tap into communities, such close links to consumers can bring risks. Proximity to users gives companies a treasure-trove of data to exploit, but mistakes can be magnified to an embarrassing degree. Push the wrong button and a message can zip its way to the wrong person. Worse still, the wrong message can go to thousands of people by mistake. If that happens, companies have to be pro-active and apologise immediately.</p> <p>Companies really have to listen to customers instead of merely paying lip service to the notion. Mr Davis says companies are horrified when he urges them to give out the managing director's email address on their websites. What happens when he gets inundated with emails? He replies: \"It's a quick way of knowing if a company has got a problem, isn't it? So it's a good way of making sure the company doesn't make mistakes.\"</p> <p>mark.tran@theguardian.com</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\" http://naima.com/\">Naima.com</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.futurizenow.com/listen/work.html\">Futurizenow.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Traditionally, the word \"community\" conjures up village fairs or small groups of like-minded people getting together, but it has taken on quite a different meaning with the internet. It was not always this way. The first internet communities bore some relation to the original meaning of the word, formed by groups of scientists or people with shared interests, a world vividly and enthusiastically portrayed by Howard Rheingold in his classic 1993 book, The Virtual Community. Now \"community\" conjures up an image of commerce as much as of cosy fellowship. Go to any networking event, sooner or later someone with a new website or about to create one will utter the word like a mantra. Entrepreneurs harp on about community for several reasons. First, the larger the membership of an online community, the greater the number of advertisers attracted. Second, the community represents a mini mass-market for companies as the market becomes increasingly fragmented. With the advent of the internet, that hoary old chestnut, \"the customer is king\", becomes more of a reality. Customers can browse for bargains, making it difficult for a company to build up customer loyalty. The internet is a paradox: It creates a virtual global market yet fractures it into millions of pieces at the same time. Take Amazon.com. The online bookseller says it can ship to virtually any address around the globe, so the world is its oyster in a sense. The only problem is that other companies such as Barnes and Noble, its bricks and mortar rival, also sell books on the net. If Barnes and Noble offers better service and cheaper books, customers may desert Amazon with the speed of its tumbling share prices. Amazon's defence is to build up a sense of loyalty and community. In building up a community, Amazon also acquires data about customers. This data amounts to a valuable currency because the more a company knows about its clients, the better placed it is to offer them what they want, although it has to take care not to rile them over-eager marketing. Because of this database, Amazon can exploit the information to sell other products besides books, which is why it has branched into other areas such as tools and hardware, beauty products and electronics. Amazon is creating a virtual department store based on the relationships that have been developed through its client base. \"Amazon is more than just about selling books,\" says Gerard Davies, an internet consultant. \"It's about forming relationships and managing those relationships.\" The community thus is no longer a group of like-minded fellows, swapping jokes and recipes but a potential commercial nirvana to corporations. That is why entrepreneurs like Michael Zur-Szpiro, who has set up a site for home buyers and sellers called Mooov.com, harp on such much about community. The site - one of several devoted to the housing market - invites people to share their horror stories and runs stories about celebrities and their stories about moving. With the importance of communities, a whole new industry has cropped up around community building on the net. Amy Jo Kim, who has been building online communities for 10 years for companies like America Online and webzines, has written a useful guide for community builders. She sets down a number of fundamental principles, such as the importance of designing a site that can adapt to the changing needs of its members and of creating and maintaining feedback loops. \"Successful community building is a constant balancing act between the efforts of management (that's you) to plan, organise and run the space, and the ideas, suggestions and needs of your members,\" she writes. Other community gurus such as Cliff Figallo, part of the Futurize Now consulting group in San Francisco, also stress the importance of listening to community members. But as desirable as it is for companies to build or tap into communities, such close links to consumers can bring risks. Proximity to users gives companies a treasure-trove of data to exploit, but mistakes can be magnified to an embarrassing degree. Push the wrong button and a message can zip its way to the wrong person. Worse still, the wrong message can go to thousands of people by mistake. If that happens, companies have to be pro-active and apologise immediately. Companies really have to listen to customers instead of merely paying lip service to the notion. Mr Davis says companies are horrified when he urges them to give out the managing director's email address on their websites. What happens when he gets inundated with emails? He replies: \"It's a quick way of knowing if a company has got a problem, isn't it? So it's a good way of making sure the company doesn't make mistakes.\" mark.tran@theguardian.com Useful links Naima.com Futurizenow.com",

      "bodyText": "Cherie Booth QC, the prime minister's wife, was yesterday accused of becoming \"an unaccountable cross between First Lady and Lady Macbeth\" after co-authoring a newspaper article in defence of the new Human Rights Act. The attack was launched, with the apparent support of Conservative Central Office, by John Bercow, MP for Buckingham and a newly-appointed member of Ann Widdecombe's shadow home affairs team. \"Cherie Blair is breaking the long-standing convention that prime ministers' spouses do not push their own political agendas. It is unclear whether Cherie's end goal is to be lord chancellor or whether she is happy to direct policy from behind the throne,\" he said. The Tories have had huge problems getting women elected to parliament: of the 122 women MPs, only 14 are Tories and few have been selected to fight winnable seats at the next election. Mr Bercow's attack coincided with a report that the Conservative Policy Forum, the link between Mr Hague and grassroots Tories, had warned him the party was anti-gay and in danger of being out of touch on women's issues and marriage. The MP, who was responding to Ms Booth's article in yesterday's Daily Telegraph, was hitting two targets for the price of one. Tory rightwingers do not like the Human Rights Act which is due to incorporate the European convention on human rights into British domestic law from October 2. Nor, with the exception of Margaret Thatcher, do they like powerful political women, especially clever women lawyers. \"What is clear is that Cherie has a bad dose of Hillary syndrome,\" Mr Bercow said. Mrs Blair has spoken out in favour of family-friendly employment policies, job shares and stronger protection against sex and gender harassment. Yesterday Tory HQ issued a five-page statement highlighting \"the increasing public profile of Cherie Booth QC\" on such issues, suggesting she may follow Mrs Clinton in seeking elected office. The reality is more prosaic. Friends believe Ms Booth would like to become a high court judge. That may not be easy while her husband is in No 10.

The two Britons, Det Sgt Adrian Prangnell and PC John Yore, were picked up last week inside Montenegro, close to its border with Kosovo, by Yugoslav federal troops when they were returning from a holiday break on the Montenegrin coast. Although British diplomats have so far been denied access to the pair, their lawyer said that they may face four counts including attempted terrorism and violating Yugoslav sovereign territory. The two men are on secondment to the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, helping with police training in UN-administered, Nato-controlled Kosovo. The Foreign Office dismissed the Serbian charges on Monday as \"paranoid\" while the men's relatives have described the accusations as ridiculous. While there seems to be no doubt about the men's innocence, this may not spare them from a long and arduous ordeal. Their misfortune is to have been caught up in a new wave of anti-western agitation launched by Mr Milosevic in the run-up to snap federal presidential elections due on September 24. As so often in the past, the policemen and the two Canadian civilians (like four Dutch nationals arrested in similar circumstances three weeks ago) have become virtual hostages as Mr Milosevic, using the state-controlled media, attempts to persuade Serbs that they are once again under assault from the western nations that failed to oust him during last year's Kosovo war. Mr Milosevic is not especially popular among the population of Serbia, but the west is even less so after a year of sanctions and ostracism following Nato's bombing campaign. The Yugoslav leader is also using the incident to underscore his claims that the pro-western government of President Milo Djukanovic in Montenegro is in league with western spies and assassins determined to subvert the Yugoslav federation. As in Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia over the past decade, there is growing sentiment within Montenegro in favour of independence from the Yugoslav federation dominated by Serbia. But the Yugoslav army maintains 15,000 troops there and Mr Milosevic seems determined to thwart any attempt at secession. The recent G8 summit in Okinawa expressed support for the Montenegrin leader, as have the US, Britain and some other European countries. But two close neighbours, Italy and Greece, are more ambivalent, fearing another Balkan conflict on their doorstep. Mr Milosevic, meanwhile, calculates that despite expressions of solidarity, Nato countries would be extremely reluctant to launch another Kosovo-style intervention in Montenegro. The fate of the two policemen may now depend on the outcome of the September polls. Mr Milosevic's chances of re-election have been helped by a split among the notoriously fractious Serbian opposition parties, which currently plan to field two, rival anti-Milosevic candidates.

As an indicted war criminal wanted by The Hague tribunal, and a man with few friends beyond Moscow and Beijing, he may refuse to relinquish power for fear of being arrested or being forced to go on the run. If he calculates that he is going to lose the election, Mr Milosevic could launch an even bigger internal crackdown than anything he has attempted in the past.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I recently met a man who I'd have to describe as an acid casualty who has never taken acid. He claims to be a film-maker, and has recently directed an instructional video for would-be cult leaders called Mind Control Made Easy. This guy is, naturally, a Nietzschean at heart. And after a few too many beers at a Manhattan microbrewery, he can apply the principles of The Birth of Tragedy to explain his obsession with Britney Spears. \"It's the Dionysian drag of her ass and the Apollonian snap of her breasts that's got me hooked,\" he says. He does not own either of her albums because the drag and the snap have nothing to do with music. </p> <p>As Britney herself would say, Whatever. </p> <p>Like most pop culture phenomena, people's fascination with Britney Spears has absolutely nothing to do with what she is purportedly famous for, which is to say, singing and dancing. This is, most understandably, a source of huge frustration for Britney and for many other modern icons: they wish to be famous for their talent. After all, they insist, long before they became a thing, they sang schmaltzy ballads at wedding receptions or acted in soap operas, and were paid to do an honest day's work because they were good at it, not because they were famous, since they were not yet famous. </p> <p>Hence we have a situation wherein Demi Moore wants to be known as a great actress, not as a pregnant woman with a bare belly on the cover of Vanity Fair. Madonna wants us to believe that The Next Best Thing is a good movie, not that she is just a compelling cocoon of public metamorphoses and an occasional advocate of free expression. Marilyn Monroe married Arthur Miller and then more or less died of her desire to be more than a dumb blonde. </p> <p>Occasionally, the person actually does transcend the persona. Cher won an Oscar. Princess Diana devoted herself so thoroughly to international good deeds that, by the time of her death, she was actually thought of as an international do-gooder. But mostly you are left with a situation where Britney Spears can say to Rolling Stone: \"It's not about my personality. People couldn't see me through the radio.\" </p> <p>As if. </p> <p>Since I myself earned more notoriety for being naked on the cover of my book Bitch than for anything I actually wrote in the pages between, I am intrinsically and intuitively sympathetic with the burden of being Britney. It is, no doubt, a pain in the ass to be all tits and ass. But, my God, she is so good at it that I wish she would simply embrace this role and stop trying to deny it. </p> <p>Trouble is, unlike all the other aforementioned icons, Britney Spears's entire appeal is in denying her entire appeal. Unlike, say, Madonna, who never pretended to be anything other than an overtly sexual being, Britney Spears has built an entire image around insisting that she does not mean to be sexy. She can't help it if men get hot and bothered when they see her in a schoolgirl uniform, a plaid micro-mini with thigh-high tights and a top tied just below her breasts, the better to bare her slightly fleshy midriff. She can't help it if guys get excited over pigtails and baby fat, the two main characters in her very first video. And it is not her fault if people with dirty minds think that she is asking to be bent over and spanked when she begs a boy to \"Hit me baby one more time\". It's not her fault that grown-ups don't know that that's just a teenage way of asking a guy to call her pager. </p> <p>The hot pants and push-up bra on her first cover of Rolling Stone were just normal: down south where Britney comes from and sweat is plentiful, no one wears much clothing. The skin-tight vinyl in the video for Oops ... I Did it Again, the python outfit cut down to there and up to there designed especially for her 18th birthday party, the sequinned cleavage top that served as slight support for her absolutely natural bursting breasts at the American Music Awards and the clingy white jumpsuit she performed in at the Grammys are all a fashion statement, a fun day of dress-up for a little girl raiding Mommy's closet. Choosing Gregory Dark, a director of pornographic movies, to make the video for From The Bottom of my Broken Heart was simply an artistic decision, a tribute to his vision. And she cannot be blamed that lesser minds might find her Yorkshire terrier, Baby, and her tour bus full of puffy pillows and scented candles from K-Mart reminiscent of a New Orleans bordello. </p> <p>After all, she told YM magazine that she plans to stay a virgin until she is married, and despite rumours of a heady romance, Britney and Justin Timberlake - of the boy band 'N Sync - have only recently enjoyed their first kiss. She is still a good, Baptist girl from Kentwood, Louisiana, who is saddened that she often cannot find the time to attend church when she is on the road. And, whatever perverted fantasies might pollute the minds of men, most of her albums are purchased by pre-pubescent girls with innocent ears who like to sing along with danceable pop songs and love to imitate Britney's style. </p> <p>In her cover of the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction, lyrics like \"He can't be a man because he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me\" have been excised because Britney Spears would never smoke anything. In another twist on Satisfaction, she even delivers some babe-a-licious feminism: when the girl comes on and tells her \"how tight my skirts should be\", she doesn't pay attention because \"She can't tell me who to be/ I've got my own identity\". And when Britney sings the line, \"I'm not that innocent\", she is just being gamely in a song about playing games. </p> <p>She is a good actress who, like Brooke Shields as an 11-year-old prostitute in Louis Malle's Pretty Baby, does not really know the implications of the part she is playing. \"It's like on TV, if you see Jennifer Love Hewitt or Sarah Michelle Gellar kill someone, do you think they go out and do that?\" she asked in a recent Rolling Stone interview. And she is so good at insisting that she has no idea why more people search the internet for naked pictures of her than for any other celebrity that I must admit that I am not certain that she is in on her own image. Who the hell knows? </p> <p>All this is much too confusing for a simple girl like me. </p> <p>I like bubblegum music as much as the next person - if the next person happens to be 12 years old. But for all the emphasis on how Britney Spears is a product of some wizardly Swedish producers, I find both her albums damn near unlistenable; optically unnerving; jarringly brassy - like having your ears boxed with a pair of large metal cymbals. Her voice is nothing special. If Dear Diary is any indication, she can't write songs to save her life. And yet I admit I am charmed by Britney Spears. If I am confused by her pleas for sexual absolution, I completely believe that she is a sweet, sweet girl who has worked hard and deserves all her success. </p> <p>But there's something wrong with this. After all, sweetness should not sell albums; talent should. And I'm pretty convinced that she has little to none. Christina Aguilera, Britney's main rival for the teenybopper, girl-power audience, has a big, beautiful voice. And I think her song What A Girl Wants is a pretty good argument for boys' deference to female desire. But I can't stand Christina - she has none of the Britney charm, none of the sugar, none of the southern honey. Aguilera's music is less irritating, but her personality is more so. Britney wins on congeniality alone. </p> <p>And who can say that talent is anything so great anyway? Britney Spears's career is basically Debbie Gibson redux, right down to their early days entertaining shoppers as they passed between the Body Shop, the Gap and Laura Ashley in the local malls. Feature for feature, Debbie and Britney look unbelievably alike, neither one a beauty, but both full of cheerleader, popular-girl prettiness that makes them so appealing to teenage girls who can safely aspire to their bottled-blonde good looks. Just as Britney is linked with one of the members of 'N Sync, Debbie was constantly denying rumours that she was dating Jordan from New Kids On The Block. If it were 1988, this essay would be about Debbie Gibson. </p> <p>But instead of pondering her latent sexuality, any article about Gibson would beg the question about why such a talented teenager would be the purveyor of such schlock. After all, Gibson played the piano, had her own studio in the garage of her parents' Long Island home, actually wrote the songs on her albums and acted as her own producer and arranger. When I interviewed her back then, I kept asking her - to no avail - why she was the way she was. I kept saying in frustration that most adolescents with the abilities she had would be rebellious and nasty and would start bands and make a lot of noise, because gifted people usually are rebellious and nasty, and they usually can't curb the urge to make a lot of noise. Why wasn't she into grunge? Why wasn't she bitter and twisted the way talented people are supposed to be? </p> <p>And then I remembered that most riot grrrls have no actual musical talent, and, if they did, maybe they would be producing albums of silly love songs and odes to electric youth, just like Debbie Gibson. I kept confusing the means of production with the meaning behind it. I was a victim of false consciousness. After all, Lesley Gore was also known to write some of her own songs. </p> <p>At any rate, with all her talent, Debbie Gibson is nowhere to be found a decade later. She has done some musical shows, but her attempts to make sexy, adult albums with lushly produced videos by the sensual photographer Matthew Ralston did not result in the record sales that her teenage anthems once racked up. Without the vocal chops to really carry a theatrical career, Deborah Gibson - the name she uses on Broadway marquees - has mostly disappeared. </p> <p>In all likelihood, Britney Spears's fate will be similar. But who knows? Madonna was supposed to be a one-hit-wonder, and now all the prayers of the Church of England could not get rid of her. She has shown us that image-making is itself a genuine talent. Courtney Love was supposed to be a mere footnote to Kurt Cobain's career - but who's sorry now? The truth is, nobody knows the nature of evanescence or the secret of staying power. Come to think of it, nobody really knows why anything is as it is. </p> <p>As it happens, Britney Spears was shockingly funny when she recently hosted the comedy show Saturday Night Live. Playing a hip-hop hoodlum who used to be on The New Mickey Mouse Club and was now dissing Britney Spears, the real Spears was hilarious. She did a perfect self-parody. </p> <p>Or maybe she was just reading her lines. </p> <p>Somebody recently told me that I should get rid of my navel ring. She said it gave men the wrong idea. And, at 33 years old and no longer nubile, I apparently ought not be putting out that vibe. </p> <p>Now, I don't know how it is possible to give men \"the wrong idea\", or even what exactly that is. Probably something about being loose and wild and easy - a sure thing in the sack, shall we say. It's not so innocent. </p> <p>But in truth the main thing I can say about the ruby hoop in my belly button - besides that I like it - is that it hurt like hell to get it pierced. Serious pain. I mean, you cannot imagine. And then, for six months thereafter, we are talking about the kind of infections and assorted health problems of such a vile magnitude that one woman at a cocktail party was moved to warn me that it might lead to infertility. I spent so much time swabbing my poor, pussed-up navel with hypoallergenic soap and alcohol that I started to think it would have been less trouble to adopt a puppy. Or raise a child. </p> <p>But 10 years later, I still love it. </p> <p>Britney Spears recently got her navel pierced. What does it mean in her case? What was she thinking on that day in Hawaii when she and her girlfriends, these clean teens from Bayou country, walked into a tattoo parlour with skeletons everywhere, run by a \"lady who was, like, a devil worshiper or something\" and walked out with holes in their tummies? </p> <p>Actually, it means nothing. The signifier and the signified have gone their separate ways, as is always the case in current semiotic thinking. Men with long hair might vote for Tory MPs, guys with earrings - I mean in both ears - are usually not gay, Princess Zara has a tongue stud, Prince William wears an Eton vest meant to look like something out of Austin Powers, and a ring in the nose is a passing teenage fad that has nothing to do with worshipping Kali or Vishnu. There are hippie capitalists, there are millionaire computer programmers in Silicon Valley with purple hair. And so it has been for quite a while now. What, in this day and age, is really subversive? </p> <p>Is it Britney Spears herself, or the way she seems not to get it? Or is it the wink-wink way in which she appears to be a complete constructor of her own sexiness, feigning innocence? For that matter, is innocence subversive? </p> <p>We went through the light-of-my-life and fire-of-my-loins of Lolita so many years ago that by 1980 the Police could reference Nabokov in Don't Stand so Close to Me with casual knowingness. Just the same, in the United States you can buy a porn magazine called Barely Legal and a teenage pop star's career can still be built on her accidental sexuality. Of course, Humbert Humbert's fantasy about Lolita was predicated on the idea that she is unaware of \"her own lusciousness, that as a nymphet she is almost grubby and boyish\". But later in the book, Lolita - or rather, Dolores - takes the sexual power that Humbert has assigned her and turns it against both of them. By the end, she is a tawdry housewife, and her seducer and tormentor is a ruined man. Lolita did not age very well; awareness destroyed her just as Adam and Eve's eating from the Tree of Knowledge got them expelled from the Garden of Eden. </p> <p>How long can Britney Spears linger in paradise before all of us notice that her eyes were wide shut all along? </p> <p>Elizabeth Wurtzel is the author of Prozac Nation, her latest book is The Bitch Rules (Quartet).

      "bodyText": "I recently met a man who I'd have to describe as an acid casualty who has never taken acid. He claims to be a film-maker, and has recently directed an instructional video for would-be cult leaders called Mind Control Made Easy. This guy is, naturally, a Nietzschean at heart. And after a few too many beers at a Manhattan microbrewery, he can apply the principles of The Birth of Tragedy to explain his obsession with Britney Spears. \"It's the Dionysian drag of her ass and the Apollonian snap of her breasts that's got me hooked,\" he says. He does not own either of her albums because the drag and the snap have nothing to do with music. As Britney herself would say, Whatever. Like most pop culture phenomena, people's fascination with Britney Spears has absolutely nothing to do with what she is purportedly famous for, which is to say, singing and dancing. This is, most understandably, a source of huge frustration for Britney and for many other modern icons: they wish to be famous for their talent. After all, they insist, long before they became a thing, they sang schmaltzy ballads at wedding receptions or acted in soap operas, and were paid to do an honest day's work because they were good at it, not because they were famous, since they were not yet famous. Hence we have a situation wherein Demi Moore wants to be known as a great actress, not as a pregnant woman with a bare belly on the cover of Vanity Fair. Madonna wants us to believe that The Next Best Thing is a good movie, not that she is just a compelling cocoon of public metamorphoses and an occasional advocate of free expression. Marilyn Monroe married Arthur Miller and then more or less died of her desire to be more than a dumb blonde. Occasionally, the person actually does transcend the persona. Cher won an Oscar. Princess Diana devoted herself so thoroughly to international good deeds that, by the time of her death, she was actually thought of as an international do-gooder. But mostly you are left with a situation where Britney Spears can say to Rolling Stone: \"It's not about my personality. People couldn't see me through the radio.\" As if. Since I myself earned more notoriety for being naked on the cover of my book Bitch than for anything I actually wrote in the pages between, I am intrinsically and intuitively sympathetic with the burden of being Britney. It is, no doubt, a pain in the ass to be all tits and ass. But, my God, she is so good at it that I wish she would simply embrace this role and stop trying to deny it. Trouble is, unlike all the other aforementioned icons, Britney Spears's entire appeal is in denying her entire appeal. Unlike, say, Madonna, who never pretended to be anything other than an overtly sexual being, Britney Spears has built an entire image around insisting that she does not mean to be sexy. She can't help it if men get hot and bothered when they see her in a schoolgirl uniform, a plaid micro-mini with thigh-high tights and a top tied just below her breasts, the better to bare her slightly fleshy midriff. She can't help it if guys get excited over pigtails and baby fat, the two main characters in her very first video. And it is not her fault if people with dirty minds think that she is asking to be bent over and spanked when she begs a boy to \"Hit me baby one more time\". It's not her fault that grown-ups don't know that that's just a teenage way of asking a guy to call her pager. The hot pants and push-up bra on her first cover of Rolling Stone were just normal: down south where Britney comes from and sweat is plentiful, no one wears much clothing. The skin-tight vinyl in the video for Oops ... I Did it Again, the python outfit cut down to there and up to there designed especially for her 18th birthday party, the sequinned cleavage top that served as slight support for her absolutely natural bursting breasts at the American Music Awards and the clingy white jumpsuit she performed in at the Grammys are all a fashion statement, a fun day of dress-up for a little girl raiding Mommy's closet. Choosing Gregory Dark, a director of pornographic movies, to make the video for From The Bottom of my Broken Heart was simply an artistic decision, a tribute to his vision. And she cannot be blamed that lesser minds might find her Yorkshire terrier, Baby, and her tour bus full of puffy pillows and scented candles from K-Mart reminiscent of a New Orleans bordello. After all, she told YM magazine that she plans to stay a virgin until she is married, and despite rumours of a heady romance, Britney and Justin Timberlake - of the boy band 'N Sync - have only recently enjoyed their first kiss. She is still a good, Baptist girl from Kentwood, Louisiana, who is saddened that she often cannot find the time to attend church when she is on the road. And, whatever perverted fantasies might pollute the minds of men, most of her albums are purchased by pre-pubescent girls with innocent ears who like to sing along with danceable pop songs and love to imitate Britney's style. In her cover of the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction, lyrics like \"He can't be a man because he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me\" have been excised because Britney Spears would never smoke anything. In another twist on Satisfaction, she even delivers some babe-a-licious feminism: when the girl comes on and tells her \"how tight my skirts should be\", she doesn't pay attention because \"She can't tell me who to be/ I've got my own identity\". And when Britney sings the line, \"I'm not that innocent\", she is just being gamely in a song about playing games. She is a good actress who, like Brooke Shields as an 11-year-old prostitute in Louis Malle's Pretty Baby, does not really know the implications of the part she is playing. \"It's like on TV, if you see Jennifer Love Hewitt or Sarah Michelle Gellar kill someone, do you think they go out and do that?\" she asked in a recent Rolling Stone interview.

The drivers, both French, were killed instantly, as was the young daughter of one of them who was riding with him in the cab.</p> <p>A couple of hours later, the driver of an army truck carrying 20 foreign legionnaires apparently lost control of his vehicle and drove into a tree near Castelnaudary in the south of France. Four young soldiers died and seven others were seriously injured.</p> <p>These were dramatic accidents, and the one involving the British coach -- which was carrying 38 children and eight adults from Scotland and Essex to a week's canoeing, raft-building, abseiling and windsurfing holiday in southern France -- made headlines here as well as in Britain.</p> <p>Armand Jung, a French socialist MP, has renewed calls for an outright ban on overnight coach journeys, citing statistics that show the worst road accidents occur between 2am and 7am. \"Tour operators just want to save a night's hotel bills, so the passengers sleep on the coach,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, so do the drivers, even if they take shifts at the wheel.\"</p> <p>But French road accident statistics show a lot more than that. The busiest weekend of the year, when July holidaymakers returning home cross August vacationers heading south, was relatively accident-free this year thanks to some 400 miles of tailbacks around the country.</p> <p>The three spring Bank Holiday weekends, however, clocked up 271 dead and more than 5,000 injured. On average, one person (1.037, to be exact) dies every hour on a French road. Since 1945, almost as many French people have been killed in cars as died in the second world war.</p> <p>In fact, France's roads are more dangerous than those of any other country in Europe except Greece and Portugal, where surfaces tend to be lousy and cars old. In 1998, there were 144 French road fatalities per million inhabitants, compared with 117 Italian, 93 German and 58 British.</p> <p>Even Isabelle Massin, who heads the government's inter-ministerial working group on road safety, is not optimistic. \"The average French person does not take driving offences seriously,\" she said. \"We have never had such tough road legislation, but French society just does not react. Murderous driving is a French disease.\"</p> <p>The main cause of this mass slaughter is well known: the French still drink and drive, and they do it more than anyone else in Europe. Alcohol is the most important factor in more than 30% of fatal French road accidents, a proportion that has not changed in 20 years. In Britain over the same period, it has halved.</p> <p>According to the statistics, the French also gaily ignore speed limits, red lights and stop signs more frequently than all their European neighbours, and somehow neglect to fasten their seatbelts as often.</p> <p>University sociologists looking for an explanation for such behaviour have seized on one interesting fact: the worst danger on French roads is posed not by the young hothead but by the middle to upper-level executive, aged 35 to 50 and driving a fast, expensive car.</p> <p>The authoritative daily, Le Monde, recently argued that with people like this -- adult, responsible citizens -- heading the accident statistics, France was clearly grappling with a problem that was about more than just bad driving. Maybe, it suggested, driving represented a subconscious desire by the French to escape from their nannying, ever-present state, to thumb their noses at the forces of law and order. In protestant northern Europe, it suggested, people tended to have a much better developed sense of collective responsibility.</p> <p>Jean-Pascal Assailly, a psychologist who specialises in driver behaviour, says the French tolerate dangerous driving because \"it's a kind of agreed escape valve for violence. In America, everyone has a gun. In France, we speed. We love speeding. Speeding is a positive value in French society, like confidence, competitiveness and a stylish disregard for danger. The car satisfies that\".</p> <p>Sadly, for some 8,500 people a year, that \"stylish disregard for danger\" means the end of their lives. And until there is the will to change French attitudes, through effective anti-drink driving campaigns, better traffic policing, road safety education from primary school up, and maybe (why not?) a ban on overnight coach journeys, accidents like yesterday's will continue to happen.</p>",

The busiest weekend of the year, when July holidaymakers returning home cross August vacationers heading south, was relatively accident-free this year thanks to some 400 miles of tailbacks around the country. The three spring Bank Holiday weekends, however, clocked up 271 dead and more than 5,000 injured. On average, one person (1.037, to be exact) dies every hour on a French road. Since 1945, almost as many French people have been killed in cars as died in the second world war. In fact, France's roads are more dangerous than those of any other country in Europe except Greece and Portugal, where surfaces tend to be lousy and cars old. In 1998, there were 144 French road fatalities per million inhabitants, compared with 117 Italian, 93 German and 58 British. Even Isabelle Massin, who heads the government's inter-ministerial working group on road safety, is not optimistic. \"The average French person does not take driving offences seriously,\" she said. \"We have never had such tough road legislation, but French society just does not react. Murderous driving is a French disease.\" The main cause of this mass slaughter is well known: the French still drink and drive, and they do it more than anyone else in Europe. Alcohol is the most important factor in more than 30% of fatal French road accidents, a proportion that has not changed in 20 years. In Britain over the same period, it has halved. According to the statistics, the French also gaily ignore speed limits, red lights and stop signs more frequently than all their European neighbours, and somehow neglect to fasten their seatbelts as often. University sociologists looking for an explanation for such behaviour have seized on one interesting fact: the worst danger on French roads is posed not by the young hothead but by the middle to upper-level executive, aged 35 to 50 and driving a fast, expensive car. The authoritative daily, Le Monde, recently argued that with people like this -- adult, responsible citizens -- heading the accident statistics, France was clearly grappling with a problem that was about more than just bad driving. Maybe, it suggested, driving represented a subconscious desire by the French to escape from their nannying, ever-present state, to thumb their noses at the forces of law and order. In protestant northern Europe, it suggested, people tended to have a much better developed sense of collective responsibility. Jean-Pascal Assailly, a psychologist who specialises in driver behaviour, says the French tolerate dangerous driving because \"it's a kind of agreed escape valve for violence. In America, everyone has a gun. In France, we speed. We love speeding. Speeding is a positive value in French society, like confidence, competitiveness and a stylish disregard for danger. The car satisfies that\". Sadly, for some 8,500 people a year, that \"stylish disregard for danger\" means the end of their lives. And until there is the will to change French attitudes, through effective anti-drink driving campaigns, better traffic policing, road safety education from primary school up, and maybe (why not?) a ban on overnight coach journeys, accidents like yesterday's will continue to happen.",

Anger at the outburst by Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, Israel's most politically powerful rabbi, showed little sign of subsiding among Palestinians or Jews - despite his half-hearted attempt to soften the shock of his weekend diatribe. In a second sermon, released to Israeli television yesterday and broadcast on the pirate radio networks of his followers, Rabbi Ovadiah accused his critics of misinterpreting his words. \"Who doesn't bemoan the Holocaust?\" asked the spiritual leader of the Shas party. \"Six million Jews, among them 1m children were killed by the wicked Nazis. All were holy and pure and complete saints.\" However, in his original sermon the rabbi had said the 6m embodied earlier souls who had \"sinned time and again and were reincarnated so that things could be set right\". That was the version that reverberated across Israel yesterday, threatening to deepen the two faultlines cleaving Israeli society: the antagonism between secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews, and the economic and cultural divide between Jews of European origin, and the Jews of Middle Eastern origin, or Sephardim, who form the majority of the underclass. Support groups for the 300,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel said that they were flooded by calls and visits. Some survivors were hungry for a genuine expression of regret from the rabbi. Others wanted to hold a vigil in striped concentration camp uniforms outside the rabbi's house - where police arrested a man who said he wanted to \"put a bullet through the head\" of Rabbi Ovadiah.

Instead, officials of the Shas party called for a 24-hour police guard for their leader to stem the tide of protest against his remarks. And the rightwing and religious Hatzofeh newspaper accused Israeli television and radio of fabricating the sermon. \"Radio stations have broadcast what sounds like the voice of Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef saying these things, and on television, his figure is seen speaking these words,\" the newspaper said. \"The rabbi is simply not capable of saying such things; the conclusion is that those who are slandering Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ... are employing impersonators.\" The extreme reactions to the rabbi's sermons illustrates the centrality of the Holocaust to non-Orthodox Israeli Jews. \"In the non-religious part of Israel, the Holocaust is increasingly important and has become a very very central part of Israeli identity,\" said author Tom Segev, who has written extensively about the Holocaust. \"There are some who say the Holocaust is practically a religion. It is the way non-Orthodox Israelis connect to Jewish history. If the Orthodox world attacks the Holocaust, it definitely deepens the gap in Israeli society.\" The annual commemoration of the Holocaust has been a source of friction. Some ultra-Orthodox Jews ignore the siren that sounds two minutes' silence each year on Holocaust Day, arguing that the dead should be remembered only through prayer. Even so, few Orthodox religious scholars would dare to argue as Rabbi Ovadiah did that the Holocaust was God's way of punishing sin. Most believe the Holocaust is too enormous an evil to be understood by mere human beings.",

Yet his view of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is far more liberal than that of other religious leaders.</p> <p>The followers of Rabbi Ovadiah's Shas party, overwhelmingly members of an Israeli underclass made up of Middle Eastern and north African Jews, take a hardline view of negotiations with the Palestinians.

      "bodyText": "Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef has a penchant for antagonising secular Israelis - over the years he has cursed the supreme court, cabinet ministers, kibbutz dwellers, doctors and Israeli Arabs. Yet his view of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is far more liberal than that of other religious leaders. The followers of Rabbi Ovadiah's Shas party, overwhelmingly members of an Israeli underclass made up of Middle Eastern and north African Jews, take a hardline view of negotiations with the Palestinians. But the Baghdad-born rabbi has argued since the early 70s that religious law supports territorial concessions - if they save Jewish lives. That stance, together with the 400,000 voters who see the rabbi as a divine figure - and the network of religious schools it has fostered - has transformed Shas into a powerhouse. It is the third largest party in the Israeli knesset (parliament) and its departure from the ruling coalition last month robbed the Labour-led government of its majority in parliament. By fusing ethnic pride with ultra-orthodoxy and a relatively mild approach to the quest for peace, Shas has in theory been a willing coalition partner for rightwing and leftwing governments since the 1980s. The party proved its muscle yet again last week when it got a relative nonentity elected president instead of Nobel prize winner Shimon Peres. After the rabbi's remarks on the Holocaust and Arabs, liberal commentators yesterday urged the prime minister to stop wooing Shas back. \"Any pursuit by Ehud Barak of the blasphemous rabbi, from this moment on, will be considered un conscionable kowtowing, the disappearance of any trace of self respect, grovelling,\" a leader in the Tel Aviv daily Ma'ariv said. But Mr Barak will continue to grovel. His emissaries were hard at work yesterday courting the rabbi's acolytes. \"Shas represents a political reality that can not be ignored. To have any real power to make decisions regarding the peace process, the coalition needs Shas,\" said a commentary in Ha'aretz newspaper, which criticised Mr Barak for failing to hold regular meetings with the rabbi.",

      "bodyText": "There was an outcry, talk of an international incident and protests to the Home Office last night after customs officials barred the \"stars\" of the world's last true flea circus from entering the country. The Cardoso Flea Circus is having to recast its show at the Edinburgh Festival after its crack troupe of hybrid \"superfleas\" were turned back at Heathrow airport as illegal immigrants. All survived the 21-hour flight back to Australia but were \"visibly traumatised by their ordeal\", according to the show's producer Tory Laudon, who has protested to the \"highest level\". William Burdett-Coutts, artistic director of the Assembly Rooms, who helped bring the circus to Britain for the first time, said: \"This is no way to treat artists.\" The troupe, which includes several tightrope-walking fleas, came from a special crossed strain of kangaroo and cat fleas, ctenocethalides felis, which the circus's founder, Maria Cardosa, has been breeding for years. Their exploits are projected on to a large screen from a camera fitted with a magnifying lens so audience can fully appreciate their skill and daring. But yesterday Ms Cardosa was frantically assembling an alternative cast from fleas sent from Cambridge and Bristol universities. The show must go on in Princes Street Gardens tonight. Her flea wrangler, Wyman Leung, has been picking out potential stars and working one to one with them. Ms Laudon said the Sydney-based circus had never have had a flea flee from it in all its years on the road. The circus had not bothered trying to train \"rather stupid\" human fleas, the pulex irritans, although some local Scottish cat fleas were found to have \"amazing tenacity.\"",

This sounds like a good Edinburgh wheeze: the company does not have to pay exorbitant venue-hire charges and the audience do not have to travel. But in a festival full of gimmick and hype, The Tempest turns out to be a rough-and-ready but enchanting version of the play.

But Signal to Noise's production takes the idea of theatre as transformation even further, completely transforming your relationship with your living space. I cannot now sit on our sofa without having a mental picture of the exuberant Ariel bouncing up and down with sheer joy at the prospect of freedom. This production of The Tempest is a sharp reminder of something we so often forget: theatre is an experience that you have, not a place that you go. </p> <p>It is the brainchild of director Chris Goode, who began working on a student version at Cambridge back in 1994 after reading an interview with Peter Hall, who argued that Shakespeare could not be performed in tiny spaces. He revived the idea when the year-old Signal to Noise decided that it would like to have an Edinburgh presence but couldn't afford the venue fees. </p> <p>Goode is at pains to point out that while Signal to Noise may become known in Edinburgh as the company that allows you to \"dial-a-Tempest\" , it has no plans to make a habit out of performing in people's homes. There will be no follow-up versions of Psycho in your bathroom or Lady Chatterley's Lover on your tigerskin rug. Nor is the company making a fortune. Since they charge \u00a340 for an audience of up to six, this is undoubtedly the best-value show in town. </p> <p>As far as Goode is concerned, people's homes are simply the best place to perform a play that is all about changing perceptions, altered states and geographical confusions, allowing him and the cast to take the audience on a journey in which the familiar becomes disconcertingly unfamiliar. On Sunday night in the Guardian's Edinburgh flat, a bedroom doorway became Caliban's lair and Ferdinand was found undertaking Prospero's tasks (better known as our washing up) in the kitchen. The production takes place in semi-darkness using an array of improvised lighting from torches and bicycle lamps to candles and fairy lights. </p> <p>There is something infinitely touching about watching Miranda and Prospero's murmured conversation from just a foot away, and hearing Shakespeare being spoken not declaimed. The effect is less like watching a play than eavesdropping. \"When you are doubling up characters you have to make sure that the storytelling is really clear and sharp,\" says Goode. \"You can't get away with tricks or technique. People can see through it. Very early on we decided we would play it very straight with no gloss and definitely no postmodern irony.\" </p> <p>And that is why this Tempest works. It is transparently honest and shiningly sincere. You long for the lovers to be happy, ache for Ariel to be free and when Prospero promises to give up his magic your heart gives a wistful lurch. I have never seen a Tempest that has been quite such fun or moved me quite so much. At the end we sit in pitch black for a few seconds, slightly stunned. Then we awake as if from a dream.

      "bodyText": "A string of millennium projects opened with national lottery money is in crisis because estimates of visitor numbers were \"wildly optimistic\", the president of the Museums Association said yesterday. Patrick Greene urged the millennium commission to consider axeing a planned \u00a315m tower in Portsmouth and using the funds as a safety net for existing attractions. The experience of the Millennium Dome in Greenwich, the National Centre for Pop Music in Sheffield and the Earth Centre in Doncaster showed the dangers of relying on exaggerated predictions of visitor numbers, he said. Figures for the dome were scaled back from 15m to 12m, then to 6m. The commission's figures show that the Earth Centre has attracted only 120,000 visitors, as against the 320,000 predicted. By contrast, the Tate Modern gallery in London has drawn more than 1m people since it opened in May. Its projected figure was 380,000. Mr Greene said one way to secure the future of attractions such as the Earth Centre was to claw back money from projects still on the drawing board. He thought the overestimated numbers came about \"because of an underestimate of the amount of competition there is out there for people's leisure time\". Admissions were \"crucial to your financial viability\". Each project had a business plan based on a certain number of visitors. \"The millennium commission needs ... a safety net to nurse projects through their difficult first year or first two years.\" A commission spokeswoman said it could have opened projects only in London or Edinburgh, where success was a surer bet, but this would have denied the regions the spin-off benefits of investment. She pointed out that once contracts were signed, the commission could not legally withdraw from projects. Centres in difficulty needed to reinvent themselves, attracting conferences and educational visits, she said. The Earth Centre, for example, opened with \u00a350m of lottery money, was going to run residential courses for students. The commission's director, Mike O'Connor, said: \"If you are ambitious and take risks you do run into the occasional problem, but if you didn't take some risks you wouldn't get out of bed in the morning.\" The Big Idea, a museum dedicated to technological innovation, built on the site of Alfred Nobel's home in Irvine, north Ayrshire, has received more than 10,000 school visits and exceeded its visitor target. The Lowry arts centre in Salford's dockland, Greater Manchester, has had capacity attendances, attracting more than 270,000 visitors. \u0095 Another millennium project has run into financial difficulties: the two pedestrian bridges alongside the Hungerford bridge over the Thames in London. Second world war munitions could still rest in the riverbed around the existing bridge, the Cross River Partnership, which has had millennium commission funding towards the \u00a330m project, said yesterday. It also said safety concerns following the Southall and Paddington rail crashes had led London Underground to call for revised safety requirements for construction of bridge piles. The partnership would \"reassess the project in the light of these changed circumstances\", which had pushed up the cost. It is in talks with the government and the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone.

This is news not only because she is standing in a gallery but because she stands before a great moment of optical insecurity - a disturbing vision that comes as close as possible to representing the unrepresentable. She appears to be snoozing before Salvador Dali's vision of the unconscious, subliminal world. </p> <p>She's not, in fact - it's just that the handful of really challenging, truly iconoclastic paintings in the exhibition Salvador Dali: Optical Illusions, do take some looking at. They twist, distort, revel in paranoiac double vision, borrow from Old Masters and then do weirdness with them. \"I just can't get the nose,\" an American says, reading that he should be able to see a dog's face in one of the paintings. \"Here, see?\" a local points. You just know this will go back as a tale of how friendly the Scots are: \"That's right - one of them showed me the nose right away.\" </p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Breton said that looking at these great paintings was like doing a crossword. He meant this as an insult, crosswords not being the number one hobby among card-carrying Surrealists, but this is actually one of the pleasures of works like Apparition of Face and Fruit Dish. We don't know where to look; we don't know what we are looking at. Just as the syntax of the title is missing bits, we also lack the syntax to make sense of the painting. </p> <p>It's a still life and a landscape all at once; there is no fixed horizon; shapes and forms jump out from corners; perspective is elastic. There is a face and a fruit dish, but a dog too, with a tunnel where his eyes should be and a collar that looks like a viaduct. Not only do people spend a long time in front of these paintings; they move, bend, crane their necks, straining lest they miss an extra nose, a donkey, a melting piano. </p> <p>In Madonna of Port Lligat (1949), Dali incorporates the Renaissance iconography of Piero della Francesca to make a new vision of the Madonna for a post-war, broken world. Dali wanted to present this image to Pope Pius XII - this was at the height of his flirtation with religion- and we can only guess what he would have made of Dali's use of traditional symbolism (fish and bread), floating along with the deities in a bizarre skyline filled with chunks of masonry. </p> <p>To get us to look carefully at Dali's technique as a painter is no mean feat, given that we know and love/hate him for just about everything else he did. There is also the fact that much of his later output is rotten and doesn't bear close scrutiny (and there are some stinking howlers here too, like his 1982 painting based on Velazquez's Portrait of the Infanta Margarita). But curator Dawn Ades has pulled it off in an intelligent show that brings to life Dali's struggle to stretch representation. </p> <p>You see it in something like The Invisible Man (1929), his first brush with what he called the \"paranoiac critical method\", which was based on the idea that in certain psychologically extreme states, such as paranoia, we perceive differently. Dali thought that if we could bring that difference into view, layer the multiple realities - make vision fluid rather than fixed - we might get close to making visible the unconscious. And if in the end we couldn't, it might at least be fun to try. </p> <p>Even now, The Invisible Man looks like nothing else on earth, with its odd symbolism - sweet pink forms side-by-side with dark swirling masses from which leap faces, bodies and phantoms. You can spend ages before it, trying to fathom where Dali has borrowed from, what his symbolism is all about, what the different elements might add up to - and yet something still eludes us. This and the initial wow factor are what separate Dali at his best from being merely a crossword puzzle. </p> <p>At his worst, another kind of wow factor kicks in: wow, how could he? The displays of late visual trickery are painful. Stereoscopic pairs of images, such as Athens is Burning (1979), are seen through angled mirrors to intensify perspective. Peeking through, you can't help wondering why he bothered. These half-hearted enterprises are a world away from the attempts to stretch what it was possible to make visible. </p> <p>It was in the tasteless, tacky 70s, of course, that Dali dabbled in the tasteless, tacky world of holograms, the cheesiest antithesis imaginable to his radical works of the 20s and 30s. Dali could always have fun, even in the early days (see the Venus de Milo with Drawers from 1936, her body featuring drawers opened with rabbit-tail pom-pom handles), but the hologram here, Dali Painting Gala, 1973, is less the work of a madman, more the lame offering of a sad man long past his best. It's as if Dali, Gala and Chairman Mao are spinning round endlessly, like a stuck record. If this was among the most tasteless fare in the whole room that is dedicated to Dali merchandise (yes, they do have melting clocks), it might look OK. Here it looks like the cheap, weak gesture it is. </p> <p>But that's partly because the best work here can still take our breath away, still keep us rooted to the spot. Even run-of-the-mill Dali can sometimes astound - like The Eye (1945), one of five paintings connected with his work on the dream sequence for Hitchcock's Spellbound. No foundation-shaking optical trickery here. Instead, a glassy, weeping eye, suspended in mid-air over a sky like a bruise. It is reminiscent of the eye-slitting scene in Un Chien Andalou, the 1928 film Dali made with Bunuel. Most of all, it underlines that Dali is all about looking: in the early days, work that had to be looked at, and in the later years, work that begged and bullied to be. </p> <p>He had, Freud said, the eyes of a \"candid fanatic\". He may have grown less candid but his love of being the subject and object of the voyeuristic gaze never left him.

The family, who have two young children, fled for their own safety and their council house on Portsmouth's Paulsgrove estate was boarded up following the violence. Neighbours said the family's car was overturned and their terrified screams could be heard in the street. They had moved their two young children out a few days earlier, fearing they would be targeted. Hampshire police have declined to say why the family would have been targeted and would give no information about any criminal convictions.

Until Sunday, the campaigners had remained peaceful, encouraging passing motorists to beep their horns in support of their plan to drive suspected paedophiles from their homes. The trouble started when the family were targeted after locals drew up a hit list of 20 suspected paedophiles. The deputy chief constable of Hampshire police, Ian Readhead, appealed for calm, claiming innocent families were being targeted. This was confirmed by residents yesterday who say another family have been forced to flee after vigilantes mistakenly confused their name with that of a suspected paedophile. \"Innocent and frightened people are being caught up in these acts of violence.

      "bodyText": "Health fears over hands-free mobile phone kits were today quashed by a government report which confirmed their use could substantially reduce levels of radiation going into the brain. The report from the Department of Trade and Industry concludes that phone users can actually cut their exposure to radiation by using hands-free attachments instead of holding the phone to their ear. This contradicts an earlier report by the Consumers Association which claimed the headsets trebled the amount of radiation beamed into the brains of users because the wires leading from the phone into the ear acted like an aerial, conveying a more concentrated dose of radio waves than usual. Patricia Hewitt, the minister of e-commerce, said: \"Today's report confirms that hands-free kits reduce exposure for mobile phone users. It is important that the public is provided with clear and unambiguous advice about the use of hands-free kits.\" The report concluded that the devices, which have become increasingly popular after reports linking mobile phone use to possible illness and even brain tumours, \"offer very substantial reductions in SAR (specific absorption ratio) compared to the normal use of a mobile phone held against the ear.\" The study, conducted by an independent consultancy, SARtest ltd, found all measurements were comfortably within the guidelines of the national radiological protection board, the DTI confirmed. The report said: \"The results show that, for phones with external antennas (as tested for Which? with the cable hanging vertically downwards) PHF kits do not increase SAR but reduce SAR levels compared with the normal use of the phone.\" It was found that absorption by the user of a handset in conjunction with a hands-free set could be reduced by turning the phone so the keypad faced the body. The report recommended some precautions to users of hands-free kits: \"If seeking to reduce their exposure as a precautionary measure, we recommend that users of personal hands free kits should let the earpiece cable hang down naturally from the ear, keep the cable away from the phone's antenna, and do not place the phone directly against the body.\" In May, the independent group on mobile phones and health, under the chairmanship of Sir William Stewart, also noted that other studies have been carried out which claim a substantial reduction in exposure when using hands-free kit. A report by the Australian Consumers' Association last week found hands-free kits could reduce the effects of electromagnetic radiation by 92%. The UK Consumers Association said it had commissioned further research \"to clear up the confusion\".",

The outpatients rise has to be tackled with immediate action. This increase is far too high.\" </p> <p>The seven trusts on the hit list are Aintree Hospitals, Dudley Group of Hospitals, Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Plymouth Hospitals, Southend Hospital, and Worcester NHS Trust. </p> <p>Plymouth Hospitals Trust, based at the city's Derriford hospital, was recently found to have fiddled outpatient lists, forcing the resignations of its deputy and chief executives. </p> <p>The 10% rise to 444,000 in the number enduring waits of beyond three months to see an NHS specialist left ministers attempting to convince the public that they could cure the health service. </p> <p>Lord Hunt said a quarter of the increase was in the seven named trusts out of 400 operating in England and Wales. </p> <p>Mr Blair earlier this month announced a radical restructuring of the health service, including treatment within three months by 2005 backed up by a private hospital guarantee, after the chancellor, Gordon Brown, vowed spending would go up \u00a312bn over three years. </p> <p>Lord Hunt said \u00a340m an nounced earlier would be used to cut waiting lists, broken down to \u00a313m for trusts with spare capacity to treat patients from other areas and \u00a327m for departments with long waiting lists. </p> <p>The extra expenditure on outpatients will be controlled by Whitehall to stop trusts wasting the money. </p> <p>Other figures revealed by ministers showed 1,047,900 waiting for treatment in hospitals in England, a fall of 5,000. The total has fallen by more than the 100,000 drop Mr Blair committed himself to after inheriting 1,158,000 from the Tories. </p> <p>Philip Hammond, a Tory health spokesman, said: \"Morale is at an all time low and naming and shaming and sending in hit squads is the opposite of good management.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Patients Association said: \"It is the waiting times that we and patients are really concerned about. It is unacceptable that people are waiting so long to see a consultant after being referred by their GP.\" </p> <p>Plymouth is recruiting 36 nurses from the Philippines to help clear the backlog, and John Yarnold, acting director of operations, said: \"We have a recovery plan in place to be back on course with waiting list targets by the end of September.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The number of people waiting more than 13 weeks for an outpatients appointment has already started to fall.\"</p>",

The figures appeared to vindicate claims by doctors' leaders and opposition politicians that ministers had extended queues to meet overstretched consultants to cut in-patient waiting lists. Staff from the government's national patient access team are to visit all seven hospital trusts within the next few days to start compiling proposals to deliver the \"dramatic improvements\" over the next six months promised by the government. Lord Hunt, a health minister who used to speak on behalf of health authorities, said: \"The public's top concern about the NHS is waiting for treatment. The outpatients rise has to be tackled with immediate action. This increase is far too high.\" The seven trusts on the hit list are Aintree Hospitals, Dudley Group of Hospitals, Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Plymouth Hospitals, Southend Hospital, and Worcester NHS Trust. Plymouth Hospitals Trust, based at the city's Derriford hospital, was recently found to have fiddled outpatient lists, forcing the resignations of its deputy and chief executives. The 10% rise to 444,000 in the number enduring waits of beyond three months to see an NHS specialist left ministers attempting to convince the public that they could cure the health service. Lord Hunt said a quarter of the increase was in the seven named trusts out of 400 operating in England and Wales. Mr Blair earlier this month announced a radical restructuring of the health service, including treatment within three months by 2005 backed up by a private hospital guarantee, after the chancellor, Gordon Brown, vowed spending would go up \u00a312bn over three years. Lord Hunt said \u00a340m an nounced earlier would be used to cut waiting lists, broken down to \u00a313m for trusts with spare capacity to treat patients from other areas and \u00a327m for departments with long waiting lists. The extra expenditure on outpatients will be controlled by Whitehall to stop trusts wasting the money. Other figures revealed by ministers showed 1,047,900 waiting for treatment in hospitals in England, a fall of 5,000. The total has fallen by more than the 100,000 drop Mr Blair committed himself to after inheriting 1,158,000 from the Tories. Philip Hammond, a Tory health spokesman, said: \"Morale is at an all time low and naming and shaming and sending in hit squads is the opposite of good management.\" A spokesman for the Patients Association said: \"It is the waiting times that we and patients are really concerned about. It is unacceptable that people are waiting so long to see a consultant after being referred by their GP.\" Plymouth is recruiting 36 nurses from the Philippines to help clear the backlog, and John Yarnold, acting director of operations, said: \"We have a recovery plan in place to be back on course with waiting list targets by the end of September.\" He added: \"The number of people waiting more than 13 weeks for an outpatients appointment has already started to fall.\"",

      "bodyText": "Two British police officers accused of \"terrorist\" activities yesterday appeared before a military court in Podgorica, capital of Montenegro, as the Foreign Office and international organisations stepped up pressure on the Yugoslavian authorities for their immediate release. Western diplomats believe that Det Sgt Adrian Prangnell from Hampshire and PC John Yore from Cambridgeshire are innocent victims of a deliberate attempt by the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, to whip up anti-western feeling in the run up to federal elections next month. The two men, who were instructors at a police academy in Kosovo, were arrested on Tuesday with two Canadians, Shain Going and Liam Hill, the owners of a contracting company, after a long weekend at a Montenegrin resort. Only the magistrate, a prosecutor, a court interpreter and the men's lawyer, Vojislav Zecevic, were allowed to be present when they appeared in court yesterday. The military prosecutor's office said that charges were imminent. \"A criminal case will be launched against two British officers and two Canadians arrested by the Yugoslav army... since the investigation confirmed they committed terrorism,\" a spokesman said. Mr Zecevic said the four appeared healthy and suffered no \"personal problems\". All have denied any wrongdoing. He said he was concerned that the \"technical equipment\" allegedly found on the men - the Canadians were engaged in reconstruction work and quarrying in Kosovo - and the fact that they were travelling without documents might be sufficient for the army to raise charges against his clients. A trial would help Mr Milosevic to suggest that the independence-minded Yugoslav republic of Montenegro is relying on western \"terrorists\". Last night, the Foreign Office and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe - the agency temporarily employing the two Britons - had still not been able to contact them. But Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe, played down claims that one of the captured Canadians had fuses or explosives. \"We have, as usual with Milosevic and his regime, rumours and innuendo being spread about like confetti,\" he told the BBC. \"We have two policemen working for humanitarian causes in Kosovo, who went to Montenegro for a holiday break. It's extremely important that the regime understands that we take this matter very seriously indeed.\" An OSCE spokesman said the allegations that the men were involved in espionage were \"absurd\". It has stopped its staff from travelling to Montenegro.

      "bodyText": "Southern African leaders have thrown their support behind President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, accusing his detractors of ignoring history, and condemning a US plan to introduce sanctions as a punishment for his land policies and political violence. In recent days Mr Mugabe's government has issued seizure orders for 211 white-owned farms in defiance of the widespread condemnation of western governments and opponents at home, who warn that he risks wrecking Zimbabwe's economy. Although the farmers have the right to appeal, the land legally became government property the moment the orders were served. In a speech to a summit of the Southern African Development Community in the Namibian capital Windhoek, the body's chairman, President Joachim Chissano of Mozambique, defended Mr Mugabe by saying there was a tendency to \"put a blanket\" over the history of the independence struggles in Africa. He condemned those who portrayed \"former heroes of the freedom struggle\" as \"anti-democratic and even dictators\". \"We cannot in SADC condone these views. We are the democrats and we want democracy to work according to the will of our people in each one of our countries.\" Mr Mugabe's government says it plans to seize 804 farms without compensation in the short term, under what it calls the \"accelerated land redistribution programme\", and more than 3,000 within months. The policy has been condemned by Washington, where a sanctions bill imposing an embargo on international and bilateral loans is making its way through Congress. SADC officials said southern African leaders planned to issue a condemnation of this. But as the legal land seizures went ahead yesterday, tobacco farmers warned that they would not be able to meet the deadline at the end of this month for planting next year's crop. Zimbabwe is the second biggest tobacco exporter in the world and among the top three producers of the high quality Virginia leaf favoured by cigarette manufacturers. Tobacco accounts for about half its foreign earnings. \"Failure to achieve the 180m kg [397m lb] core business crop will jeopardise Zimbabwe's position as a leading supplier of quality flavourful flue-cured tobacco for the international brands of cigarettes,\" said Kobus Joubert of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association. Yesterday's summit grappled with the other main cause of instability in the region: the collapsing peace process in the Congo, where Zimbabwe is a leading belligerent. But it made little progress because the Congolese president, Laurent Kabila, failed to turn up. Mr Kabila's foreign minister, Abdoulaye Yerodia, said his president was \"too busy\". The mediator in the conflict, the former Botswana president Sir Ketumile Masire, said Mr Kabila's absence showed that he was not serious about ending the war.

      "body": "<p>Sir Robin Day, who has died aged 76, was the most outstanding television journalist of his generation. He transformed the television interview, changed the relationship between politicians and television, and strove to assert balance and rationality into the medium's treatment of current affairs.</p> <p>Day was the youngest of four children. His father, a Lloyd George Liberal, was on the administrative staff of the Post Office. Robin was educated at Bembridge school, had an uneventful war in the Royal Artillery, became a captain, and went on to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1947 at the age of 24, to read law. He made his mark as a memorable president of the Oxford Union.</p> <p>After two years at the bar, he decided that the prospect of success was too distant. He spent one year with the British Information Services in the United States, was briefly employed, on a temporary basis, by BBC Radio and, in 1955, joined Independent Television News, at its launch, as one of its new breed of newscasters.</p> <p>ITN made him. It gave him, by his own account, his happiest four years in television - though he was not an instant success. It was originally felt that he was too unsympathetic and harsh in manner, but this view changed as he developed an entirely new style of interviewing.</p> <p>In the pre-Day era, television interviews were almost always respectful, generally dull and stiff, often insipid. Day asked the direct question pointed like a dagger at the jugular. The turning point in his career was an interview with Sir Kenneth Clark, then chairman of Independent Television, at a time when proposals were mooted to cut ITN's airtime and money. Day asked him questions about the station's future which dumbfounded colleagues and critics by their directness. It was unprecedented that the person in ultimate charge should be questioned about his responsibilities by one of his own employees - and the impact was dramatic.</p> <p>There followed a number of historic interviews which established Day's reputation: with Egypt's President Nasser after the 1956 Suez crisis, when Day sought to pin him down on whether he accepted the existence of the state of Israel; with ex-President Truman - \"Mr President, do you regret having authorised the dropping of the atomic bomb?\"; and, notably, with Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1958, in what the Daily Express called \"the most vigorous cross-examination a prime minister has been subjected to in public\".</p> <p>This interview turned Macmillan into a television personality, and was probably the first time that television became a serious part of the political process. Day also made parliament come alive with his unscripted reports of the heated debates during the Suez debacle.</p> <p>In 1959, Day moved to the BBC and Panorama, then the most prestigious current affairs programme. The corporation never really made the best use of his talents, except at elections and, eventually, on Question Time, between 1979 and 1989. The fashion turned against \"talking heads\" and \"government by debate\", with which he, above all others, was identified. He was gradually sidelined, as a chairman figure who simply opened and closed programmes. He described his pre-Question Time period as \"10 years in the wilderness\". There was even a spell of nearly two years when he did not appear at all.</p> <p>In the early-1970s, Day became more deeply involved in radio, where he proved an innovator with It's Your Line, from 1970 to 1976. This was a national phone-in programme that enabled ordinary people, for the first time, to put questions directly to the prime minister and other politicians (it later spawned Election Call).</p> <p>He also presented The World At One, from 1979 to 1987, but never felt that radio was his metier. He was not at his best reading from a script, and it is significant that, in his memoirs, he dismisses his eight-year contribution to the programme with a single sentence.</p> <p>General elections, however, were the time when all the grand inquisitor's talents as cross-examiner came on full display, when the televsion public saw \"the scowling, frowning, glowering\" Robin Day \"with those cruel glasses\" (Frankie Howerd's description), as well as the relieving shafts of humour.</p> <p>His most satisfying role in television came with Question Time. At last, he was given his own show, with an audience - which he had long asked for - albeit late at night, as a temporary, six- month \"filler\" and mainly as a way of giving him something to do. Its success in becoming, under his chairmanship, the most popular and effective current affairs programme on television reveals a great deal about his talents.</p> <p>Why did Robin Day become a national institution, one of the most immediately recognised people in the land, outshining in reputation and respect other television stars whose shows commanded far larger audience figures, and, as he much resented, far higher salaries?</p> <p>It was because he had a unique combination of qualities. He was a very big personality in the true sense, with immense authority. He was extraordinarily witty. A collection of good Day jokes would fill a minor anthology. Question Time also brought out his charm and showmanship. He was inordinately proud of his music-hall gifts, and would insist on showing visitors to his flat videos of his appearances on the Morecambe And Wise Christmas shows and (especially) his Flanagan and Allen rendering of Underneath The Arches on the Des O'Connor show, in which he outstarred and outsang O'Connor. But, above all, he was one of the most well-informed, widely read and serious political figures in public life.</p> <p>Day imbibed politics almost with his mother's milk. His father brought him up to revere parliament and great parliamentarians. As a nine-year-old, he was taken to hear Churchill speak, in the rain. Respect for parliament and the traditional institutions of British life, such as the monarchy and the legal profession, was at the heart of his philosophy all his life.</p> <p>It might be said that his interests were somewhat conventional and narrow. He was almost fixated by parliament, and seemed to think that if someone had made a great parliamentary speech, they had won a great battle, when, in fact, it was events outside parliament that were transforming British politics. His world was one of party politics and current events, rather than long-term trends. He was not particularly interested in industrial affairs or economics, or developments in European countries.</p> <p>Gradually, his private views became more and more conservative, at times rather narrowly nationalist, although he did not allow his personal prejudices to show in public or influence his professional performances. But, within the boundaries of his particular interests, he applied his formidable powers of argument and his extensive knowledge to devastating effect, in private as well as public.</p> <p>He believed passionately in \"government by debate\" and in the need for television to balance pictures of current events with reasoned analysis. Otherwise, the powerful visual impact of television would distort and trivialise. He was equally dedicated to the principle that the interviewer had a duty to be well-informed.</p> <p>Many observers commented on his careful preparation; few realised just how assiduous he was. He would read every current biography and autobiography, and nearly every government white paper. Without research assistants to supply him with background briefings, he would generally be better informed than the many cabinet ministers he interviewed. No wonder prime ministers treated him as their equal, and lesser mortals on the political scene regarded him with awe.</p> <p>Day's contribution to British public life was not confined to the media. For 25 years he campaigned tirelessly, and eventually successfully, for the televising of parliament - not in the interests of television, but of parliament itself. He claimed that he was the first to present the detailed arguments in favour, in a Hansard Society paper in 1963.</p> <p>He also played a major part in the establishment of the national lottery. When the Rothschild Commission on Gambling was set up in 1979, he wrote a letter arguing in detail for the kind of lottery we have today. Lord Rothschild wrote back questioning his arguments. Day replied refuting all criticisms; his arguments prevailed and the eventual report recommended the scheme Day had originally proposed. He followed up with endless letters to successive ministers with relevant responsibilities.</p> <p>In his private life, Day had two personalities. To those who did not know him, he could, at times, appear aggressive and insensitive, seemingly interested only in those who were important because of their fame, public success or wealth. He sometimes found it difficult to talk naturally to intelligent women. He might, to some, have seemed the quintessential member of the all-male Garrick club, one of his favourite haunts.</p> <p>To those who knew him well, however, he was the most stimulating, amusing, convivial and warmest of companions. He was one of those rare people who was genuinely loved by his friends. He was prepared to take infinite pains on their behalf. He was also surprisingly modest; despite his obvious success in public life, he frequently talked of his career as a relative failure, because he had not achieved anything solid.</p> <p>He regretted that he had never entered parliament - although he ran as a Liberal at Hereford in 1959 - and contributed to the real world of politics, instead of playing a secondary role through television. He thrived on his public fame and was proud to be the first television star to be knighted, but privately seemed to feel that his achievements did not compare with those of others who had made their mark in the more traditional professions, especially the law, or by writing learned books.</p> <p>In 1965, he married Katherine Ainslie, an Australian law don at St Anne's College, Oxford, and had two sons. The marriage was dissolved in 1986. One of the tragedies of his life was that his elder son never fully recovered from the effects of multiple skull fractures he sustained in a childhood fall.</p> <p>Some years ago, Day had a coronary bypass, and he suffered from breathing problems that were often evident when he was on the air. He had always fought against a tendency to put on weight. As an undergraduate, he weighed 17 stone, and claimed that, in the course of his life, he had succeeded in losing more weight than any other person.</p> <p>He is survived by his two sons.</p> <p>Robin Day, broadcaster and journalist, born October 24 1923; died August 6 2000</p>",

He was inordinately proud of his music-hall gifts, and would insist on showing visitors to his flat videos of his appearances on the Morecambe And Wise Christmas shows and (especially) his Flanagan and Allen rendering of Underneath The Arches on the Des O'Connor show, in which he outstarred and outsang O'Connor. But, above all, he was one of the most well-informed, widely read and serious political figures in public life. Day imbibed politics almost with his mother's milk. His father brought him up to revere parliament and great parliamentarians. As a nine-year-old, he was taken to hear Churchill speak, in the rain. Respect for parliament and the traditional institutions of British life, such as the monarchy and the legal profession, was at the heart of his philosophy all his life. It might be said that his interests were somewhat conventional and narrow. He was almost fixated by parliament, and seemed to think that if someone had made a great parliamentary speech, they had won a great battle, when, in fact, it was events outside parliament that were transforming British politics. His world was one of party politics and current events, rather than long-term trends. He was not particularly interested in industrial affairs or economics, or developments in European countries. Gradually, his private views became more and more conservative, at times rather narrowly nationalist, although he did not allow his personal prejudices to show in public or influence his professional performances. But, within the boundaries of his particular interests, he applied his formidable powers of argument and his extensive knowledge to devastating effect, in private as well as public. He believed passionately in \"government by debate\" and in the need for television to balance pictures of current events with reasoned analysis. Otherwise, the powerful visual impact of television would distort and trivialise. He was equally dedicated to the principle that the interviewer had a duty to be well-informed. Many observers commented on his careful preparation; few realised just how assiduous he was. He would read every current biography and autobiography, and nearly every government white paper. Without research assistants to supply him with background briefings, he would generally be better informed than the many cabinet ministers he interviewed. No wonder prime ministers treated him as their equal, and lesser mortals on the political scene regarded him with awe. Day's contribution to British public life was not confined to the media. For 25 years he campaigned tirelessly, and eventually successfully, for the televising of parliament - not in the interests of television, but of parliament itself. He claimed that he was the first to present the detailed arguments in favour, in a Hansard Society paper in 1963. He also played a major part in the establishment of the national lottery. When the Rothschild Commission on Gambling was set up in 1979, he wrote a letter arguing in detail for the kind of lottery we have today. Lord Rothschild wrote back questioning his arguments. Day replied refuting all criticisms; his arguments prevailed and the eventual report recommended the scheme Day had originally proposed. He followed up with endless letters to successive ministers with relevant responsibilities. In his private life, Day had two personalities. To those who did not know him, he could, at times, appear aggressive and insensitive, seemingly interested only in those who were important because of their fame, public success or wealth. He sometimes found it difficult to talk naturally to intelligent women. He might, to some, have seemed the quintessential member of the all-male Garrick club, one of his favourite haunts. To those who knew him well, however, he was the most stimulating, amusing, convivial and warmest of companions. He was one of those rare people who was genuinely loved by his friends. He was prepared to take infinite pains on their behalf. He was also surprisingly modest; despite his obvious success in public life, he frequently talked of his career as a relative failure, because he had not achieved anything solid. He regretted that he had never entered parliament - although he ran as a Liberal at Hereford in 1959 - and contributed to the real world of politics, instead of playing a secondary role through television. He thrived on his public fame and was proud to be the first television star to be knighted, but privately seemed to feel that his achievements did not compare with those of others who had made their mark in the more traditional professions, especially the law, or by writing learned books. In 1965, he married Katherine Ainslie, an Australian law don at St Anne's College, Oxford, and had two sons. The marriage was dissolved in 1986. One of the tragedies of his life was that his elder son never fully recovered from the effects of multiple skull fractures he sustained in a childhood fall. Some years ago, Day had a coronary bypass, and he suffered from breathing problems that were often evident when he was on the air. He had always fought against a tendency to put on weight. As an undergraduate, he weighed 17 stone, and claimed that, in the course of his life, he had succeeded in losing more weight than any other person. He is survived by his two sons.

      "bodyText": "For the Jewish community, Al Gore's choice of Joseph Lieberman is \"the equivalent of getting a man on the moon\" according to Rabbi Marvin Hier, the director and founder of the Museum of Tolerance and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles. It may be more than two centuries since Francis Salvador was voted on to the provincial congress in South Carolina in 1775 and thus became the first elected Jewish official in what is now the United States, but until very recently anti-semitism has been seen as a factor to be weighed by Jewish politicians seeking office. Now, said Rabbi Hier, that may be finally changing for ever. \"This is really untested on a national basis, but I think Al Gore has made an ingenious move,\" he said. Rabbi Hier predicted real pride in the Jewish community at Mr Gore's choice and that Mr Lieberman's moral position on President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky would outweigh any lingering anti-semitism which he felt remained only in \"a small lunatic fringe\". He added: \"For years, Jews have voted for Christian politicians so I don't think there is any reason why Christians should not vote for Jews.\" A Gallup poll indicated last year that anti-semitism had decreased enormously in the last 50 years. In 1947, only 42% of the population said they would vote for a Jewish politician while the figure for 1999 was 92%. This reflects the great change in the US from a period when anyone who was not a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant was regarded as a political risk. John F Kennedy had to tackle the anti-Catholic prejudices of voters when he was elected in 1960. Demographic changes since then and the increase of the Latino vote now mean that Catholicism is probably an electoral boon. Although there are larger Jewish populations in both New York and Los Angeles than in Tel Aviv and the large numbers of established Jewish politicians in both areas reflect this, the Jewish communities in America's south and midwest are much smaller. Several states already have Jewish senators and there are strong Jewish populations in Florida, New Jersey and Ohio. Ed Rendell, the chairman of the Democratic party, who is also Jewish, told reporters at the weekend, before Mr Gore's decision: \"I don't think that anyone can calculate the effect of having a Jew on the ticket.\" He has since been criticised by Nathan Diament of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America who suggested that the remark might give legitimacy to anti-semitic views. While public attitudes to ethnic background and religion may have softened in the US, few politicians would dare declare themselves as atheist and it seems hard to imagine any Muslim achieving high national elected office given the levels of public prejudice still expressed against them. Locally, a specific ethnic background or religion can be a plus, depending on the makeup of the electorate. It did not harm Jerry Brown, twice elected as governor of California and now mayor of Oakland, that he was an active Buddhist.

Many experts believe this could have made the 1945 nuclear denouement unnecessary. US submarines did even more damage than its surface fleet, which turned the tide in the Pacific in June, 1942, when Japan's four best \"flat-tops\" were sunk in at the battle of Midway.</p> <p>Japan's desperate need for replacement carriers led to the conversion of the Shinano, laid down as a battleship in 1940.

She was intended to operate both as a carrier in her own right and, with her heavy battleship armour, as an \"unsinkable\" supply ship for other carriers.</p> <p>Because American air attacks on the Japanese mainland were intensifying, Captain Toshio Abe decided to move his ship to a less exposed anchorage at Kure, far to the west, even though her watertight doors had yet to be tested, her crew was inexperienced, her 47 aircraft had not been loaded and hundreds of shipyard workers were among the 2,515 men aboard.</p> <p>Enright, then a lieutenant-commander, was patrolling on the surface only a few miles offshore in the Archerfish, a 1,500-tonne submarine, built in 1943.

Abe assumed the submarine was one of a pack and zig-zagged, which slowed him down.</p> <p>Even so, it took Archerfish more than four hours to get within optimum torpedo range before dawn on November 29. Enright fired a complete salvo of six torpedoes at a range of 1,400 yards. Four struck home below the monster's main belt of armour.

Born in Minot, North Dakota, and commissioned in 1933, he pursued an unremarkable career in the US surface fleet before switching to the submarine service. By 1943, he was commanding the submarine Dace in the western Pacific.</p> <p>That autumn he was ordered to attack the Shokaku, one of the Pearl Harbour carriers, which had been located by US intelligence, but he could not get into a suitable attacking position and let the ship escape. He was so depressed by his failure that he asked for a shore posting. But the expansion of the submarine campaign meant that every experienced officer was needed, and he was ordered to take command of Archerfish in September 1944. He and his boat had the honour of being present for the Japanese surrender aboard USS Missouri, a battleship considerably smaller than his outsize victim.</p> <p>He stayed on in the navy after the war, retiring as a captain in 1963 and taking up a new career designing navigational gear for a defence equipment corporation.

      "bodyText": "A European commissioner must be given sole charge of managing the over-complex aid programmes if Europe is to make an impact on world poverty, a committee of MPs warns today. In a caustic report on the slow pace of reform in Brussels, the Commons select committee on international development protests that the world's biggest aid programme is still too slow in delivering money and assistance. It also complains that Africa, Latin America and Asia get less than a quarter of the money put aside for southern and eastern Europe and the Middle East. \"We are exasperated with the failure of the commission to reform its development activity effectively. We have no doubt that, were the reforms we outline implemented, the EU could make a real difference to the elimination of poverty,\" say the MPs. \"The EU is living on borrowed time - the commission should give up its addiction to half-measures and have the courage to reform for the benefit of the world's poor,\" they conclude in their latest report on the effectiveness of \u00a37.5bn worth of EU development aid. The select committee's conclusions will be welcomed by the international development secretary, Clare Short, and Chris Patten, EU commissioner for external affairs. Both have strongly criticised an aid structure which takes an average, the MPs report, of more than four years to deliver aid to victims of global disasters. The committee wants to see the EU focus its efforts \"unambiguously on poverty reduction\" among the poorest people of the poorest countries, rather than the more complex aims which tend to give large sums to middle-income states - not even the best way of reaching the poor in those states, they say. At one stage six EU commissioners were involved in the aid programme, but the committee argues that the whole budget should be given to just one commissioner. Though the EU has only 2.9 officials to handle each \u00a37m worth of aid - compared with up to nine at the World Bank - they are wary of claims that extra staff are required. Only better procedures are meeded. As reported in yesterday's Guardian, the first \u00a35m of EU aid for the four central American republics stricken by Hurricaine Mitch in 1998 will not arrive until October. One local head of a non-governmental organisation programme in Pakistan remortgaged her house to pay staff while waiting for EU funds to arrive. Today's report was one of four on aid, including the committee's evaluation of Ms Short's management of the Department for International Development. Her efforts to improve Britain's bilateral aid programmes is praised by the cross-party committee, but it is critical of her willingness to commit too much aid to China despite its human rights record. In a separate report, Ms Short rejected earlier complaints from the committee, chaired by Bowen Wells, Tory MP for Hertford and Stortford, that Whitehall's response, by the Ministry of Defence and her own department, to the Mozambique floods was late. It had to be accepted that the British armed forces would not always be the best agency to deliver emergency aid on the ground, she said. At the time of the flooding, Ms Short decided to charter five helicopters locally for \u00a3870,000, and it was not until several days into the crisis that agreement was reached with the MoD for the provision of four RAF Puma helicopters and the Royal Navy vessel RFA Fort George.",

In a flowing tie-dye dress, she told me how she'd been hounded out of the Navy, how she'd suffered for her hardly-black arts. (These are not the lyrics of a Joni Mitchell song but actual fact.) I was in Salem, Massachusetts and, in between tripping over the plastic pumpkin lanterns which lined the streets, went to lunch with this witch. Her name was Jolene. You'd think if you were a witch, the first thing you'd magic would be a nicer name. And, in her animated opposition to Salem's celebratory hoopla, she kept spilling her chowder on her tie-dye. While I was thinking of a non-spillage spell, she was sighing \"People died here. There is no reason to celebrate.\" <strong> Secrets Of The Dead</strong> (C4) sought to explain why the Puritan township of Salem started on its witch hunt in 1692 and did so most persuasively, coming up with a most surprising suspect: the bread. And all this time, I was thinking it was nasty Abigail. </p> <p>Bewitchment had been reported across Europe, from East Anglia to parts of south-east France and Germany, with the same symptoms recurring. Debilitating convulsions, the sensation of having insects crawling under the skin and terrible nightmarish visions were all attributed to the victim's bewitching at the hands of some village misfit who was then dutifully tortured/ hung/burned at the stake. While 40,000 \"witches\" were killed across Europe, the events in Salem are now the most notorious. </p> <p>But Dr Linnda Caporeal wasn't content to blame moral panic for the witch hunt. Having discovered that if the Puritans' rye crop had been infected with ergot fungus and the fungus had sneaked into the bread, those who consumed the bread would suffer what we would identify as bad acid trips, Caporeal was giddy with excitement. Ergot, we learned, was like naturally occurring LSD and as such, would induce symptoms otherwise attributable to bewitchment. </p> <p>With many an expert enlisted (including a fungal toxicologist named Maurice Moss) and the cross-referencing of bewitching events, weather and farming conditions, Secrets Of The Dead was more than plausible. Even with its high camp reconstructions of maidens writhing in beds with snakes and smoke machines and shpooky lights in fields, there couldn't have been a more conclusive case unless a written confession was extracted from the bread itself. </p> <p>But the programme became a victim of its overvaulting ambition, pointlessly linking the ergot poisonings in Salem to the Grauballe man. His peatbog-preserved stomach contents analysed, he was found to have ingested ergot and thus, we were told, had been horrifically murdered by his kinspeople who thought him possessed by a demon. Case closed. </p> <p>Ignoring the more plausible explanation that he was a human sacrifice, and was given ergot because his people knew it was hallucinogenic, and wanted him to open the gate in his mind to whatever otherworldly place they thought he was going, Secrets Of The Dead severely damaged its credibility. </p> <p>It would be easy to dismiss <strong> Gold Fever</strong> (BBC1) as a bland video diary documentary, following, as it does, rowers Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent, Tim Foster and James Cracknell as they try to qualify for the Sydney Olympics. There are, as you would expect, lots of the boys in the boat, the boys in the gym and the boys with their families. Yet expectations are surpassed, as in pieces to camera the men speak most frankly, especially Redgrave. As such, Gold Fever becomes a study of male bonding, the frailty of friendship, the unforgiving nature of being in competition and the price of pursuing your dreams. </p> <p>There are some things wrong with <strong> Tinsel Town </strong> (BBC2), the sex, drugs and house-music drama which fills the This Life time-slot but focuses on a younger, more hedonistic crowd. For starters, there's no giant queue for the cubicles in the ladies loo, there are Guinness bar towels on the bar in this supposedly hip'n'young club, and most of the episode feels like a credit sequence. Still, many of the characters are only too recognisable, much of the dialogue achingly true, and with nine parts to come, it should develop into a gripping yarn, a watercooler talking point and the target of The Daily Mail's puritanical vitriol. A ringing endorsement if there ever was one.</p>",

Someone else sells T-shirts bearing the legend \"Eddie Cochran Chippenham\" - and who can blame them? After all, what more does anyone know about Chippenham? Britain's greatest rocker, Billy Fury, grew up in Liverpool's Dingle but was buried in Mill Hill cemetery, north London. This was one of the graveyards sold by Westminster council's lovely Lady Porter in the late 80s for one penny to a construction company.

The Joe Meek Appreciation Society meet annually at a nearby pub where a sadly dwindling number of Meek acolytes can usually be called on to sing chunks of the great man's work. </p> <p>Said pub for years was The Holloway - now the horribly named Spoofer's Bar - until the pub closed after the landlord was shot dead. </p> <p>When Serge Gainsbourg died, the French showed him the kind of respect usually afforded to a head of state.

A more subtle tribute, to 60s organ king Graham Bond, was paid by mod club The Mousetrap which set up shop adjacent to Finsbury Park station. Bond's obsession with the black arts convinced him that he was being chased down a platform by demons and he promptly threw himself under a Piccadilly line train. A ten minute bus ride will take you to Parkway in Camden Town where AC/DC's Bon Scott met his maker in 1980. After a night's heavy drinking at the Music Machine - now Camden Palace - Bon went to sleep off his hangover in the back of a car, but never woke up.

Brad and Jennifer were coy in their authorised press photo, Gordon and Sarah enjoyed a front-page frenzy when news of their nuptials leaked out, and lesbians Sophie and Rena committed in style - but without legal recognition - with a ceremony at the Groucho Club and a 16-page splash in OK! magazine. Sophie Ward and her bride helped fill column inches in a dry week for news, but it is their love and respect for each other that should be noted, not how many breasts the happy couple have between them.</p> <p>The sex discrimination case brought by City analyst Julie Bower against her former employer shows that pay inequality continues to thrive: Bower claims she got a bonus of \u00a325,000 while a man doing the same job was given \u00a3650,000. Cases such as this are hyped because of the huge sums involved. But wherever you work and whatever your age, men and women should be paid the same for doing the same job. Full stop.</p> <p>It was reported yesterday that women who become obsessed with dieting are in danger of wrecking their marriages by becoming unhappy when they fail to shift the weight. But the more worrying revelation was that nine out of 10 women will go on a diet at some stage in their lives. A government summit and articles about the reality of anorexia don't seem to be getting to the root of the problem: the dissatisfaction that women feel with their bodies (often exacerbated by a partner's criticisms) and how they will deny themselves food and take diet pills to make themselves look better.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With three big weddings last week, it appears that tradition and romance are alive and well. Or are they just opportunities for career-enhancing publicity? Brad and Jennifer were coy in their authorised press photo, Gordon and Sarah enjoyed a front-page frenzy when news of their nuptials leaked out, and lesbians Sophie and Rena committed in style - but without legal recognition - with a ceremony at the Groucho Club and a 16-page splash in OK! magazine. Sophie Ward and her bride helped fill column inches in a dry week for news, but it is their love and respect for each other that should be noted, not how many breasts the happy couple have between them. The sex discrimination case brought by City analyst Julie Bower against her former employer shows that pay inequality continues to thrive: Bower claims she got a bonus of \u00a325,000 while a man doing the same job was given \u00a3650,000. Cases such as this are hyped because of the huge sums involved. But wherever you work and whatever your age, men and women should be paid the same for doing the same job. Full stop. It was reported yesterday that women who become obsessed with dieting are in danger of wrecking their marriages by becoming unhappy when they fail to shift the weight. But the more worrying revelation was that nine out of 10 women will go on a diet at some stage in their lives. A government summit and articles about the reality of anorexia don't seem to be getting to the root of the problem: the dissatisfaction that women feel with their bodies (often exacerbated by a partner's criticisms) and how they will deny themselves food and take diet pills to make themselves look better.",

But in reality, the most unexpected events can end up provoking those emotions. And just as winning the lottery might make you happy, but not in the way you imagined, the discovery that the love of your life has been unfaithful doesn't always hurt in the ways you think it will.</p> <p>This point is borne out in Passion Play, a West End production that concerns itself with a middle-aged married man who cheats on his wife when a predatory young woman seduces him. The wife is stoical throughout her ordeal. Not only does she forgive her errant spouse, she remains friends with the other woman. After all, despite having the body of Gisele, how could this twentysomething poppet resist falling for him? And as if being her best friend wasn't enough, they go shopping for sexy lingerie together and discuss her husband's tastes.</p> <p>It is a highly unlikely scenario in a play that was written by Peter Nichols nearly 20 years ago. Critics (male) have raved about its emotional honesty, though in truth it seems reactionary and out of date in its assumptions. Nevertheless, there is a single moment, when both women are trying on wispy pieces of silk, in which the wife suddenly realises that her \"friend\" is continuing the affair. She has survived feelings of sexual rejection and despair caused by her husband's behaviour, yet the pain caused by the younger woman's betrayal of their friendship is the most raw and truthful moment in the entire play.</p> <p>Perhaps the reason why this small scene still has emotional resonance is that the actual mechanics of infidelity no longer have the same power to trigger an emotional response from us. We are becoming desensitised to extracurricular lust, both as a dramatic story line and as a fact of life. These days, adultery has spawned a growth industry. The back pages of magazines used to concern themselves only with lonely hearts; now we have agencies for cheating hearts, or \"bored marrieds\" as they refer to their clients. On the internet you can log on to alibi.co.uk, a service that facilitates infidelity by providing fake phone calls, receipts and other paraphernalia for the feckless - and for those without an appropriate adulterous rendezvous, they provide a handy link to Loving Links, the biggest agency for the already attached. For the suspicious, there is Check-a-Mate, an American detective agency soon to set up shop in Britain. For a fee it will send out an alluring decoy to see if your mate is tempted, and then tape the evidence.</p> <p>In this climate, discovering that your partner has been unfaithful, however devastating that may be, feels oddly familiar. We know how we are supposed to react because we have seen it on Coronation Street and read about it in Now! magazine, so it feels all the more puzzling when our responses to infidelity are more complex than the kneejerk pain of sexual rejection.</p> <p>The truth is that there are many different levels of betrayal. Catherine Texier, a writer who lives in Manhattan, wrote movingly about the end of her 18-year marriage to fellow author Joel Rose in Breakup, published last year. The text is one long angry howl of rejection, unsparing in its detail. And yet, throughout the relentless descriptions of the pain of being supplanted by another woman, it is her melancholic sense of domestic betrayal, of being left to cook supper for their two daughters without him, that emerges most strongly.</p> <p>\"I pulled four hamburgers out of the freezer and laid them on the counter next to three ears of corn . . . and when you came down from your office upstairs - it was around 6.30pm - and saw the four hamburgers, you said, coldly, 'I'm not having dinner here tonight.' I feel a little twinge but not more than that because that's our new unspoken deal. So I say, OK, and put one hamburger back in the freezer. And right after that I feel fine.\"</p> <p>Only I bet she doesn't. I think this kind of mundane detail has the power to wound our hearts most deeply.

I had arrived home a day early from a trip and, on walking into the kitchen, came face to face with unexpected evidence of romantic betrayal: cake. Two plates, the remnants of two slices, chocolate and raspberry fondant, from a favourite patisserie. Other couples have Our Tune, we had Our Cake, only now it had been served up to woo someone else. Sternly, I told myself that I was over-reacting - anyone can eat cake. But as it happened, my suspicions were correct. Even now, I marvel at the sense of betrayal this elicited: emotional death by chocolate cake.</p> <p>Passion Play suggests that there is a link between age and attitudes towards fidelity. Again real life is more complex. One might imagine attitudes about fidelity to be more relaxed among the young, yet a recent Mori survey about moral beliefs indicated that those aged between 15 and 24 were the most unforgiving group when it came to infidelity, perhaps because theirs is the generation that has the highest number of divorced parents.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another survey, for those who set much store by statistics, suggests that women in their 40s are the least faithful. Woman's Journal polled its readers and discovered that two out of three had been unfaithful to their partners. The postwar generation can have unexpected attitudes too. For these women, particularly those brought up to define themselves through marriage rather than professional life, the issues are equally complex.</p> <p>\"I felt betrayed financially,\" says Anna Rodgers, 60. Her husband had an affair last year. \"OK, so he fell for a younger model and wanted to have a fling. Well, that's life. I could have lived with that. What I couldn't forgive was the fact that he had cashed in an insurance policy and used the money to wine and dine her, while I sat at home worrying about how we were going to manage for money after he retired in a few months. He'd lied about other money, our money, that he'd spent on her too. I felt that if he was capable of stealing from me, my future with him was untenable.\"</p> <p>Rodgers was surprised, though, by the reaction of female friends of the same age group. \"Many of them told me they thought I was mad to throw him out, that I should think about my future. I think there is still this stigma among my generation about divorce. One friend asked me whether I felt I had failed. Failed! Marriage isn't an exam. My one big regret is about money - I wish I'd been more shrewd. I tell my daughter, who is 34, that she should make sure she always has her own money, no matter who she marries.\"</p> <p>When Carol Morgan, a 26-year-old teacher, discovered that her husband of seven years had been seeing a colleague, she experienced an overwhelming sense of having been belittled professionally because of her husband's rejection.</p> <p>\"Of course it's painful to discover that your husband has been having sex with someone else, whoever she may be,\" Morgan says. \"But it wasn't the sex part of the equation that led me to end the marriage.

Drums roll, the spotlight beams, a hush falls over the audience. But is this middle-aged QC capable of the high kicks and high-octane performance needed to jazz things up on the women's front? Cherie is lucky in that new Labour's present prima donna on female issues, Baroness Jay at the Women's Unit, is not a hard act to follow. Three years on, Margaret's unit has failed to come up with a strategy for daycare facilities, equal pay, equal opportunities, or domestic violence.</p> <p>What it did unveil, in a blaze of publicity, was an anorexia summit, which saw the editors of Vogue and other women's mags munching soggy sandwiches while tut-tutting over photos of skeletal fashion victims; and the \"listening to women\" roadshow, which had the baroness being chauffeured around the land to meet with \"real\" women (God knows what they made of Lady Jay up in Jarrow).</p> <p>Mercifully, Cherie's debut in Brighton may mean Margaret's swan-song is not far off. Although the prime minister's wife is only chairing a debate on \"A Marriage of Convenience: Has new Labour Delivered for Women?\", she is doing so for a fringe event sponsored by the Institute for Public Policy Research, the left-wing think-tank with close links to the government. It's hard not to think that Cherie's presence as chairperson signals tacit acknowledgement by Tony that Jay's record needs defending - and that he needs a new ambassador for women.</p> <p>Who better than his QC spouse to argue his case? Cherie, professional high-flier, wife and mother all rolled into one, shows ordinary women that, yes, it's possible under new Labour to have it all. Despite her terrifying abilities and intimidating success, Cherie is resolutely one of us - modest background, broken home, a difficult teenage son and even a rumpled nightgown. She may enjoy occasional use of a royal jet, but she remains accessible - the kind of woman you could moan to about the boss, nappies, or the price of plums.</p> <p>Jay made a point of announcing she was not a feminist; but Cherie is a sister who's gone on record against the prime minister on the EU directive on parental leave. The fact that she's not a professional politico just adds to her appeal: there would be no spin, no hype, no condescension.</p> <p>In his wife, then, Blair has the perfect means to court those precious women's votes. Indeed, Cherie's political future seems so bright, I wonder whether, once in Brighton, she will stop at protecting Tony's party from the attacks of disgruntled feminists. She might just seize the platform to unfurl political ambitions of her own. Hillary, after all, managed to pick herself up after the health care d\u00e9bcle and is now running for mayor of New York. Does Cherie have a similar game plan - baby Leo notwithstanding? She stands a better chance than Hillary, whose steely self-control, before the cameras and in her marriage, are a turn-off to women voters who smell a fake. Cherie is reassuringly real - exhausted by childbirth, windswept on holiday, and ever so slightly naff whenever she turns that adoring gaze on her husband.</p> <p>Yes, two Blairs are better than one. At Brighton, Cherie could well turn in the kind of crowd-pleasing performance needed to restore women's confidence in new Labour. And then, who can stop her?</p> <p>* The number of individuals going bankrupt has hit a five-year high. Before you get out your handkerchiefs, let me add that it's the dot.com entrepreneurs who are swelling the bankruptcy courts. There, did you feel a touch of schadenfreude reading that? Let's face it, those teenyboppers who clicked their mice and raised their millions in less time than it took most of us to fill in a job application are difficult to mourn. For months, their smiley, Clearasil faces were everywhere, cheering us on to invest in their vision and be part of the \"two comma\" (\u00a31,000,000) crowd. We had Martha Lane Fox flicking her hair and spouting web talk on the box; we had Susannah and Trinny in the nude, best assets hidden by melons, touting for clients in posters in the Underground; and endless young nerds in chinos from the Gap, convincing City fat cats to part with their money.</p> <p>It wasn't just their youth that made us itch to wipe the smile off those dot.com faces, though. They simply weren't the kind of millionaire you could grow fond of. None of these kids seemed to boast the satisfying narrative that has inspired generations of would-be Bransons. In vain, you scanned their (very brief) bios in search of the weepy rags-to-riches story that had you rooting for the millionaire even while you envied him his Midas touch. No sign anywhere in their well-fed suburban lives of the hard slog of the self-made entre preneur - years of eating beans on toast and dodging the landlord until - eureka! - that brilliant flash of inspiration. These squillion-earners, just sat in front of a screen, came up with a website, and then sold it to techno-luddites like us. Now that their bubble is burst, Susannah and Trinny may be reduced to selling their melons at some market stall. I won't buy any, though.</p> <p>*Flying to Sydney for the Olympic games this summer will be 300 British athletes - and 500 BBC journalists. Shurely shome mishtake? Nope. And what could be more appropriate than Auntie outnumbering the runners, swimmers and riders? Despite the schmaltzy music of Chariots of Fire and the rusty memories of Seb Coe, there are few people around the world who now identify Britannia with athletic prowess, steely muscles and bulging brawn. Today, we excel at watching sports, not doing them.</p> <p>Cristina Odone is deputy editor of the New Statesman. Charlotte Raven is away.</p>",

She may enjoy occasional use of a royal jet, but she remains accessible - the kind of woman you could moan to about the boss, nappies, or the price of plums. Jay made a point of announcing she was not a feminist; but Cherie is a sister who's gone on record against the prime minister on the EU directive on parental leave. The fact that she's not a professional politico just adds to her appeal: there would be no spin, no hype, no condescension. In his wife, then, Blair has the perfect means to court those precious women's votes. Indeed, Cherie's political future seems so bright, I wonder whether, once in Brighton, she will stop at protecting Tony's party from the attacks of disgruntled feminists. She might just seize the platform to unfurl political ambitions of her own. Hillary, after all, managed to pick herself up after the health care d\u00e9bcle and is now running for mayor of New York. Does Cherie have a similar game plan - baby Leo notwithstanding? She stands a better chance than Hillary, whose steely self-control, before the cameras and in her marriage, are a turn-off to women voters who smell a fake. Cherie is reassuringly real - exhausted by childbirth, windswept on holiday, and ever so slightly naff whenever she turns that adoring gaze on her husband. Yes, two Blairs are better than one. At Brighton, Cherie could well turn in the kind of crowd-pleasing performance needed to restore women's confidence in new Labour. And then, who can stop her? * The number of individuals going bankrupt has hit a five-year high. Before you get out your handkerchiefs, let me add that it's the dot.com entrepreneurs who are swelling the bankruptcy courts. There, did you feel a touch of schadenfreude reading that? Let's face it, those teenyboppers who clicked their mice and raised their millions in less time than it took most of us to fill in a job application are difficult to mourn. For months, their smiley, Clearasil faces were everywhere, cheering us on to invest in their vision and be part of the \"two comma\" (\u00a31,000,000) crowd. We had Martha Lane Fox flicking her hair and spouting web talk on the box; we had Susannah and Trinny in the nude, best assets hidden by melons, touting for clients in posters in the Underground; and endless young nerds in chinos from the Gap, convincing City fat cats to part with their money. It wasn't just their youth that made us itch to wipe the smile off those dot.com faces, though. They simply weren't the kind of millionaire you could grow fond of. None of these kids seemed to boast the satisfying narrative that has inspired generations of would-be Bransons. In vain, you scanned their (very brief) bios in search of the weepy rags-to-riches story that had you rooting for the millionaire even while you envied him his Midas touch. No sign anywhere in their well-fed suburban lives of the hard slog of the self-made entre preneur - years of eating beans on toast and dodging the landlord until - eureka! - that brilliant flash of inspiration. These squillion-earners, just sat in front of a screen, came up with a website, and then sold it to techno-luddites like us. Now that their bubble is burst, Susannah and Trinny may be reduced to selling their melons at some market stall. I won't buy any, though. *Flying to Sydney for the Olympic games this summer will be 300 British athletes - and 500 BBC journalists. Shurely shome mishtake? Nope. And what could be more appropriate than Auntie outnumbering the runners, swimmers and riders? Despite the schmaltzy music of Chariots of Fire and the rusty memories of Seb Coe, there are few people around the world who now identify Britannia with athletic prowess, steely muscles and bulging brawn. Today, we excel at watching sports, not doing them. Cristina Odone is deputy editor of the New Statesman. Charlotte Raven is away.",

Because he has just been voted the most popular person in France, not least because this titan of the modern football game with the verve of a latter-day Johann Cruyff ... Get on with it ... was instrumental in making French football great again by playing in the team that won the World Cup in 1998 and Euro 2000. Who did he beat in the popularity poll? Catherine Deneuve, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Gerard Depardieu, Johnny Hallyday and an 88-year-old Capuchin abbot. Fading actors, an ageing rock star - and who was that last bloke? Abb\u00e9 Pierre, who won a place in French hearts for his work with the Emmaus charity, which he founded in 1949 to help the homeless. Zizou beat him into second place this year. We don't really care about French popularity polls, do we? In this case, yes, we do. Mainly because Zizou's elevation is another slap in the face for racists who dislike the multicultural nature of France. In a recent survey, 60% of French people felt that there were too many Arabs in the country. \"Ten years ago certain extremists would have seen this as a provocation,\" wrote the Journal du Dimanche this week, of Zidane's triumph in the poll. What is Zidane's background? He was born on a rough council estate in Castellane, north Marseilles, to poor Algerian immigrants. Any chance of him filling the Gallic gap in the Arsenal midfield left by Emmanuel Petit? Not unless they can stump up \u00a320m or so. Do say: \"Zizou for president\" (as French fans chanted in Paris after the World Cup victory). Don't say: \"Zizou for Tranmere.\"",

True, he didn't rule the idea out entirely. But there was - shall we say - a distinct absence of the driving enthusiasm that has marked earlier phases of his parliamentary career.</p> <p>Even I - no great admirer of his role as leader of the loony left in the 1980s - confess to a twinge of regret about this. Let's face it, a Benn speakership would have been full of incident, and might possibly have made the House of Commons an interesting, even exciting, place again. At the very least, he would have jolted the prime minister and his minions into paying some attention to it, after three years of scandalous neglect.</p> <p>Even more important, perhaps, he would have rekindled the interest of the newspapers in what goes on in the chamber of the House, in contradistinction to what goes on in the bedchambers of its members. We would have witnessed a return to real politics about real issues (or \"ishoos\", as Mr Benn prefers to call them) instead of tittle-tattle, rumours of sleaze and rows about spin doctors.</p> <p>I suspect, for example, that Mr Speaker Benn would have given new life to the almost defunct standing order No 10 procedure - a glorious instrument for forcing ministers to answer for their conduct to MPs. When I first entered the press gallery in the Macmillan years, applications to adjourn the House under standing order 10 - \"in order to debate a matter of urgent public importance\" - were commonplace. What's more, they were quite frequently granted by the then speaker, a rather disembodied Tory lawyer called Harry Hylton-Foster.</p> <p>When this happened, most of the day's scheduled business would be wiped out, to be replaced by a three-hour emergency debate on the \"matter of urgent public importance\". The responsible minister was expected to drop everything and dash to the Commons to defend himself. Among other things, it led to a series of riveting debates in which the ebullient George Brown laid waste to then home secretary Henry Brooke over - believe it or not - an asylum case. Not even today's blas\u00e9 editors would have felt able to ignore such ready-made drama.</p> <p>This drama, however, was somewhat undermined when subsequent speakers were persuaded by ministers to impose a 24-hour delay on the ensuing emergency debate. With time to consult his civil servants, the minister no longer appeared like a naughty schoolboy. Instead, he was able to stand up at the dispatch box clutching a full Sir Humphrey-style text. It was never the same again.</p> <p>Hylton-Foster eventually died of a heart attack in Bond Street (\"The only street in which he would have been seen dead,\" as one Tory wag put it) and his successors proved much less willing to grant applications under standing order 10. Sadly, this anti-libertarian trend began under the very first Labour speaker, Horace King, who took the chair soon after Wilson's election win in 1964.</p> <p>Old 'orace, as everyone called him, was an improbable choice. Most people knew him as the man nursing a pint in the corner of the Strangers' Bar. A widowed school teacher who suddenly found himself all alone in the speaker's vast house, he used to come downstairs to \"the Stranglers\" for a jar with his old mates. He also visited the Strand Corner House occasionally, where he was once spotted giving an impromptu performance on the piano. The more pompous MPs were shocked by this conduct, and a deputation was sent to ask him to desist. Which the poor fellow duly did, with the result that he developed an attachment to hock - in his view, non- alcoholic - as he sat in his lonely lodgings.</p> <p>Such was his enthusiasm for this fine German wine that it began to show. The wig began to slip rakishly, and he sometimes was seen - though no one dared say so - to have dropped off in the chair. On one occasion he attended a party in the press gallery, at which Michael Foot was a fellow guest. Mr Foot seized the opportunity to give 'orace some advice on what he should do to become a great speaker - including, I am pleased to say, a suggestion that he should grant more emergency debates.</p> <p>Swaying slightly, Mr Speaker King replied sonorously: \"I ought to have you crucified for addressing Mr Speaker like that.\" Then he dropped his voice and added: \"But if they were ever to crucify Michael Foot, I would want to be on the next cross.\" \"I knew it,\" cried Foot triumphantly, \"Barabbas!\"</p> <p>But at least 'orace was a decent enough chap. Not so the next Labour speaker, George Thomas. A bachelor, he was known as \"The Man from Mam\" because he was always going on about his mother. He secured vast public fame because he was the first speaker ever to be heard by non-MPs uttering the mantra \"Order, order!\" when the proceeding of the Commons began to be broadcast on radio. But if he seemed loveable, it was an illusion. In the end, he betrayed most of his former colleagues on the Labour benches, and eventually became almost a Thatcher groupie.</p> <p>So it was left to the incomparable Betty Boothroyd to redeem the good name of Labour and demonstrate that the people's party was capable of providing not just an adequate but an outstanding speaker. She may even have been the best speaker of my 30-odd years at Westminster. But I have considerable respect for her Tory predecessor, Bernard (\"Jolly Jack\") Weatherill, the ex-tailor who keeps a thimble in his waistcoat pocket to remind him of his origins. Best of all, he saw off the Iron Lady when she tried to steamroller her favourite, the sleekly handsome Humphrey Atkins, into the job. She never forgave him, and he never forgave her.</p> <p>I suspect that Weatherill had always felt a slight outsider in the Tory party. But he didn't let it trouble him. One of his favourite stories was about his first day as an MP, when he proudly entered one of the lavatories marked \"members only\". Safely locked in a cubicle, he heard a voice boom: \"Don't know what this place is comin' to, old boy. D'you know, I've just seen my tailor here?\"</p> <p>Theoretically, it should now be the turn of the Tories. But Buggins's turn is only a recent convention, and the current mood on the government benches seems to be that they want another Labour speaker. The danger, in that case, is that the whips will see to it that the winner is, well, more biddable than Betty. Which is why I hope someone can persuade Mr Benn to have a go, if nothing more. The two Tonys show is much too good to miss, and we might even get some real debates again.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The group believes there will be investment opportunities as the industry consolidates in the wake of the competition commission report on car pricing. </p> <p>The group said that although first half pre-tax profits fell from \u00a340.9m to \u00a330m, it still had a strong balance sheet to fund growth. </p> <p><strong> CGNU recruits ethics experts</strong><br> </p> <p>The fund management operation of newly merged insurance group CGNU yesterday stepped up its \"socially responsible investment\" team by hiring seven specialists from rival Henderson Investors. </p> <p>The CGNU business, which uses the trade name Morley, set out its goal to become the leading player in ethical investments and said it would give clients a choice between socially responsible investment products or its more traditional approach. </p> <p><strong> Ofex tightens regulation</strong><br> </p> <p>The Ofex market yesterday moved to tighten its notoriously light regulatory regime by clarifying its position on insider dealing and substantial share purchases. </p> <p>Peter Freeman, group compliance director of the market run by stockbroker JP Jenkins, said instances of insider trading on Ofex would be included within the scope of the FSA regulator's civil and criminal regime. </p> <p>Ofex companies will also be included in the Blue Book of the takeover panel, meaning companies buying large tranches of shares in Ofex-listed firms will have to declare their stakeholdings. </p> <p><strong> Fast fit tyre chain at risk</strong><br> </p> <p>A fast-fit tyre chain has gone into receivership, threatening 840 jobs. Montinex of Shipley, west Yorkshire, is the largest independent fast-fit chain in the UK and operates 144 Charlie Browns Autocentres and subsidiaries under other names throughout Britain.

The group believes there will be investment opportunities as the industry consolidates in the wake of the competition commission report on car pricing. The group said that although first half pre-tax profits fell from \u00a340.9m to \u00a330m, it still had a strong balance sheet to fund growth. CGNU recruits ethics experts The fund management operation of newly merged insurance group CGNU yesterday stepped up its \"socially responsible investment\" team by hiring seven specialists from rival Henderson Investors. The CGNU business, which uses the trade name Morley, set out its goal to become the leading player in ethical investments and said it would give clients a choice between socially responsible investment products or its more traditional approach. Ofex tightens regulation The Ofex market yesterday moved to tighten its notoriously light regulatory regime by clarifying its position on insider dealing and substantial share purchases. Peter Freeman, group compliance director of the market run by stockbroker JP Jenkins, said instances of insider trading on Ofex would be included within the scope of the FSA regulator's civil and criminal regime. Ofex companies will also be included in the Blue Book of the takeover panel, meaning companies buying large tranches of shares in Ofex-listed firms will have to declare their stakeholdings. Fast fit tyre chain at risk A fast-fit tyre chain has gone into receivership, threatening 840 jobs. Montinex of Shipley, west Yorkshire, is the largest independent fast-fit chain in the UK and operates 144 Charlie Browns Autocentres and subsidiaries under other names throughout Britain. Administrative receiver Ernst &amp; Young said the plan was to continue business with the aim of selling the company as a going concern. 4,000 savers gain bonus A banking watchdog yesterday ordered Bristol &amp; West to raise the amount of interest it pays to thousands of savers with discontinued accounts - those no longer available to new customers. More than 4,000 savers with the former building society will now get up to 31 times more interest. The Banking Code Standard Board said the announcement \"shows we have got some teeth\".

      "body": "<p>Sir Alec Guinness, who has died aged 86, was one of the best known and loved English actors of the 20th century. He was also a profoundly unostentatious and reserved man, and although he undertook a great variety of roles, all were informed at heart with the wisdom of the sad clown. It was this spiritual severity, together with those cool, clear, wide-open eyes, capable of melting on screen to the most reassuringly serene of smiles, which lent his performances force and authenticity.</p> <p>In his later career, Guinness became something of an icon of spirituality and enlightened human understanding - especially after playing Obi-Wan Kenobi, in Star Wars (1977), with a notable and profound emotional charge. Subsequently, he was bemused to find himself being consulted as an agony uncle by American students, as a sort of substitute for CS Lewis. More important for him personally, his Star Wars contract guaranteed 2% of the profits, though the role had been much reduced, and he had nearly left the production.</p> <p>The resulting financial security made this already fastidious actor even choosier about live stage roles. After Star Wars he was in just two West End plays, and was an unusual and sensitive Shylock at Chichester in 1984.</p> <p>But Guinness was not the first great actor to find the ability, and the inclination, to learn parts after 70 much reduced. He had already avoided the theatre for six years when he came to star as TE Lawrence in Terence Rattigan's Ross in 1960. More than any other English star of his generation, he was equally at home on stage, in film and on television - where he had an Indian summer as John Le Carr\u00e9's spymaster, Smiley, in the BBC's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979) and Smiley's People (1981-82) .</p> <p>Guinness had an impecunious childhood, with a modest boarding-school education at Pembroke Lodge, in Southborne, and Roborough, in Eastbourne. At 18, he got a job as a junior copywriter in Arks Publicity, an advertising agency.</p> <p>In his discreet autobiography, Blessings In Disguise (1985), he describes how the acting bug had bitten him. On the recommendation of John Gielgud, who assumed he was related to brewing and money, he got in touch with the formidable and eccentric Martita Hunt. She was, he noted, the first woman he had met who wore silk trousers and painted her toenails, and she coached him to audition for a Leverhulme scholarship at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. But Rada were not giving the award that year, so he enrolled at the Fay Compton studio for as long as his money lasted, and then rapidly went to work in the London theatre. He made his debut at 20, walking on in Libel! at the Playhouse.</p> <p>In his unpretentious and beautifully written book, Guinness exorcised a long-suppressed anxiety about his origins. He was, he made clear, illegitimate - his name a mystery, his father probably called Geddes, the circumstances of his conception vague. His mother was Agnes Cuffe, and he was registered as Alec Guinness de Cuffe.</p> <p>Finally, the question of his birth did not matter to him, but in the beginning it must have. A reluctance to expose himself, an almost neurotic discretion, was famously the mark of both his professional and his personal style. In a 1953 monograph about him, the critic, Kenneth Tynan, wrote: \"Were he to commit a murder, I have no doubt the number of false arrests following the circulation of his description would break all records.\"</p> <p>While still only 20, Guinness was a flowery Osric, in Gielgud's Hamlet at the New Theatre. Thereafter, until the outbreak of the second world war, his career alternated between working with Gielgud, or with Tyrone Guthrie at the Old Vic, where he impressed with a modern-dress Hamlet in autumn 1938. Even the Sunday Times's formidable critic, James Agate, conceded that Guinness's refusal to play the role in a traditional way had \"a value of its own\".</p> <p>Guinness always denied having any technique as an actor - or knowing what technique might be. Yet he was proud of his gift. A favourite story, which he told quite often, concerned his time in The Seagull, in May 1936, playing the small part of Yakov. The director Komisarjevsky, a big influence, was convinced that he was pulling a rope to open the little stage curtains for the play within a play in the first act. But, as Peggy Ashcroft pointed out to Komis's chagrin, there was, in fact, no rope.</p> <p>For Guinness, the purpose of acting was to make believe. The theatre was an act of faith, whose object was to tell the inner truth about situations and feelings, not to embroider falsehood with trickery and display.</p> <p>He was a master of disguise, as he demonstrated in the Ealing comedy Kind Hearts And Coronets (1949), with a multiplicity of roles. But the Kind Hearts gallery of family victims was consciously broad brush. Guinness was an actor, not an entertainer or vaudevillian like Peter Sellers, who specialised in pretence and adopting other personas. The spiritual core of his inner conviction remained the same - whatever game of actorish disguise he might play.</p> <p>Guinness's conversion to Roman Catholicism followed an episode in France during the 1954 filming of Father Brown, in which he was GK Chesterton's cheery cleric-cum-detective. Walking back in the dark to the station hotel of a village near Macon, and still wearing his cassock, his hand was seized by a small boy, a complete stranger, who called him \"Mon p\u00e8re\" and trotted along beside him chatting in French. Despite his phony credentials as a cleric, Guinness felt strongly that the reality of this trust was important. When his 11-year-old son Matthew was temporarily crippled with polio, he had taken to dropping in on church and praying.</p> <p>As an actor, Guinness had acute and particular tastes, an infallible instinct for the apt moment, the ideal tone, the canny strategy. When he was Fool, to Laurence Olivier's unsuccessful King Lear (1947), he explained to me once, the irritating (to Olivier) fact that he, Alec, had the lion's share of the reviewers' favour was a direct consequence of Larry's actor-managerish vanity.</p> <p>\"Every time Larry came on stage, the lights went up in his vicinity. All I had to do was just stay very close to him.\" Guinness, of course, could not fail to be noticed - if only because he was doing so little so well.</p> <p>He knew his own vulnerabilities and exploited them with courage. That lent the danger to his best performances. He had resented, for instance, the Oliviers' assumption, in the mid-1930s, that he was Gielgud's boyfriend. Not because he could not have been, or was ashamed or offended to be cast in that role, but because he was not, and they had no reason to assume it. In 1938, Guinness became a scrupulous husband and father - though his sexuality was complex.</p> <p>Typically, he did not balk at playing the transvestite criminal Mrs Artminster in Wise Child (1967), with the then glamorous-looking Simon Ward. His Lawrence, in Ross, rang dangerously true to self. Being mixed-up, discreet, acutely intelligent and voraciously well-read fuelled the neurotic, but muffled, engine that drove him as an artist.</p> <p>Being so private a personality let Guinness bring out the normally hidden interior aspects of Harcourt Reilly, in TS Eliot's The Cocktail Party. He played this role at Chichester, Wyndham's and the Haymarket in 1968 and 1969, as well as in Edinburgh and New York in 1950. His radio reading of Eliot's Four Quartets were spellbinding. He was perfect material for Alan Bennett's Old Country (1977) and Habeas Corpus (1973). In the latter, he devised - and performed alone - a typically self-revealing dance at the end.</p> <p>Tynan's fine portrait of him misinterpreted the diffidence and humility. Guinness, Tynan wrote, \"never will be a star in the sense that Olivier is . . . He does everything by stealth . . . He will illumine many a blind alley of subtlety, but blaze no trails . . . His stage presence is quite without amplitude; and his face, except when, temporarily, make-up transfigures it, is a signless zero.\" The suggestiveness, the wish to avoid being domineering, was a different sort of contract with the audience's imagination. Guinness also wielded glacial fierceness and terror with unchallengeable authority.</p> <p>His greatness did without Olivier's showmanship, Ralph Richardson's abandoned cussedness or Gielgud's resonant lyricism. Tynan admired, but was inclined to patronise, Guinness's poetry and versatility. At 24, in 1951, the critic was engaged by Guinness as Player King, in his second Hamlet. Guinness invested much amour propre in this production. Tynan called it \"Hamlet with the pilot dropped\", and said it was cast with \"exuberant oddness\".</p> <p>Yet, ironically, its failure turned out to be a major factor in Guinness's career, leading him away from the classics and Shakespeare into films, ultimately television, and new plays. Tynan found Guinness less potent in the classical arena because he expected actors to perform like concerto soloists.</p> <p>I did not see Guinness's inspirational Richard II, for Ralph Richardson's Old Vic company, at the New Theatre (now Albery) in 1947. But his Macbeth at the Royal Court (1966) was certainly a quiet, clipped tragic victim, without the expected sexiness and physicality.</p> <p>In fact, Guinness was an actor for a new theatrical style, subtle and undecorated. From the 1960s, in the West End, he mostly created roles in brand new plays, rather than challenging memories of Gielgud, Richardson or Olivier. He might have been a marvellous and unusual Lear, but, when he took the role on radio, it was underwhelming. Though his work in Alan Bennett's plays was superb, he was far less inclined at the end of his career to accept risks as Gielgud - secure in a theatrical dynasty - famously did with Harold Pinter, David Storey and Julian Mitchell.</p> <p>He was always a bit of a social upstart in an English theatre world full of great families, a self-made actor with no advantages, dependent on a very spiritual stillness and charisma. When I first met him in the mid-1970s, he had a slightly grand shyness off-stage. Yet, of all the great British stage actors, his was the busiest film career, for which his modest way of acting was flawless.</p> <p>Guinness was not just an actor. He was good at drawing and did a really charming, diffident design for his own Christmas cards each year. Like Caruso, he was a natural at caricatures, especially of himself. His handwriting was beautiful. He was a very able author. Just before the war, his stage version of Great Expectations - later the basis of David Lean's film - had been directed by George Devine.</p> <p>His adaptation of The Brothers Karamazov, directed by Peter Brook in 1946, marked his return to the stage, as Mitya, after war service in the Royal Navy. He had joined as a rating in 1941, been commissioned in 1942 and commanded a landing-craft ferrying supplies to the Yugoslav partisans. He also appeared in the West End during the war, in Rattigan's Bomber Command play, Flare Path.</p> <p>After playing Herbert Pocket, in Lean's Great Expectations (1946), and Fagin, in Oliver Twist (1948), Guinness went on to a series of glorious Ealing comedies - perhaps most memorably as the bankteller-turned-robber Henry Holland in Charles Crichton's The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), for which he was nominated for an Oscar, and as the criminal Professor Marcus, in Alexander Mackendrick's The Ladykillers (1955).</p> <p>His greatest film role was probably Colonel Nicholson, in Lean's The Bridge On The River Kwai (1957), where his quintessentially English stiff upper lip under dreadful Japanese maltreatment and, eventually, obsessive unreasonableness, won him a best actor Oscar and numerous other prizes.</p> <p>Further work included the artist Gulley Jimson, in The Horse's Mouth (1958) - another Oscar nomination - with his own screenplay based on Joyce Carey's novel. In 1959, he starred in Carol Reed's Our Man In Havana, and a year later gave a brilliantly unpleasant Scottish impersonation of an irascible soldier in Tunes Of Glory. It was not followed by many more good film starring roles, and Guinness settled mostly for lucrative supporting parts in films like The Quiller Memorandum (1966), The Comedians (1967) and Cromwell (1970).</p> <p>Yet some of those supporting roles were distinguished - Prince Feisal, in Lean's Lawrence Of Arabia (1962), General Yefgrav Zhivago, in Doctor Zhivago (1965), and Professor Godbole, in A Passage to India (1984). In Anthony Mann's The Fall Of The Roman Empire (1964), Guinness's Marcus Aurelius was one of the film's few redeeming features.</p> <p>He was again nominated for an Oscar with Star Wars (1977), and six years later appeared in its sequel, Return Of The Jedi. Yet another Oscar nomination followed his appearance as Dorrit, in Christine Edzard's epic adaptation of Dickens's Little Dorrit (1988).</p> <p>At the end of the 1970s, he achieved a new fame with his television appearances in the BBC2 adaptations of Le Carr\u00e9's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People. These works were effectively his screen monument, and for which he achieved Bafta awards.</p> <p>Guinness was a charming, fascinating and elusive companion. He did not enjoy playing the star, though he liked the respect he got when visiting famous restaurants. From the mid-1950s, he lived in a modest way outside Petersfield, in Hampshire, with a large garden that much occupied his wife, Merula, whom he had married in 1938.</p> <p>He had a small circle of particular friends, many outside the theatre. For years, he and Merula were close to Rachel Kempson and Michael Redgrave. If one visited him in his dressing room in the West End in the 1970s, one might find a surprisingly broad collection of people there, many of whom were never destined to discover what the others' link with the great actor might be. He preferred to keep his friends separate; he was a one-to-one person.</p> <p>He liked good food and drink. His favourite London hotel was the Connaught, with its superb cuisine. He was not a club man. He was knighted in 1959 and made a Companion of Honour in 1994.</p> <p>Anybody outside his immediate circle was intrigued by the Guinness enigma. But the reserve through which that attractive generosity and warmth powerfully shone was, for him, an impenetrable and necessary protection.</p> <p>He is survived by Merula and his son, Matthew.</p> <p>Alec Guinness, actor, born April 2 1914; died August 5 2000</p>",

Not because he could not have been, or was ashamed or offended to be cast in that role, but because he was not, and they had no reason to assume it. In 1938, Guinness became a scrupulous husband and father - though his sexuality was complex. Typically, he did not balk at playing the transvestite criminal Mrs Artminster in Wise Child (1967), with the then glamorous-looking Simon Ward. His Lawrence, in Ross, rang dangerously true to self. Being mixed-up, discreet, acutely intelligent and voraciously well-read fuelled the neurotic, but muffled, engine that drove him as an artist. Being so private a personality let Guinness bring out the normally hidden interior aspects of Harcourt Reilly, in TS Eliot's The Cocktail Party. He played this role at Chichester, Wyndham's and the Haymarket in 1968 and 1969, as well as in Edinburgh and New York in 1950. His radio reading of Eliot's Four Quartets were spellbinding. He was perfect material for Alan Bennett's Old Country (1977) and Habeas Corpus (1973). In the latter, he devised - and performed alone - a typically self-revealing dance at the end. Tynan's fine portrait of him misinterpreted the diffidence and humility. Guinness, Tynan wrote, \"never will be a star in the sense that Olivier is . . . He does everything by stealth . . . He will illumine many a blind alley of subtlety, but blaze no trails . . . His stage presence is quite without amplitude; and his face, except when, temporarily, make-up transfigures it, is a signless zero.\" The suggestiveness, the wish to avoid being domineering, was a different sort of contract with the audience's imagination. Guinness also wielded glacial fierceness and terror with unchallengeable authority. His greatness did without Olivier's showmanship, Ralph Richardson's abandoned cussedness or Gielgud's resonant lyricism. Tynan admired, but was inclined to patronise, Guinness's poetry and versatility. At 24, in 1951, the critic was engaged by Guinness as Player King, in his second Hamlet. Guinness invested much amour propre in this production. Tynan called it \"Hamlet with the pilot dropped\", and said it was cast with \"exuberant oddness\". Yet, ironically, its failure turned out to be a major factor in Guinness's career, leading him away from the classics and Shakespeare into films, ultimately television, and new plays. Tynan found Guinness less potent in the classical arena because he expected actors to perform like concerto soloists. I did not see Guinness's inspirational Richard II, for Ralph Richardson's Old Vic company, at the New Theatre (now Albery) in 1947. But his Macbeth at the Royal Court (1966) was certainly a quiet, clipped tragic victim, without the expected sexiness and physicality. In fact, Guinness was an actor for a new theatrical style, subtle and undecorated. From the 1960s, in the West End, he mostly created roles in brand new plays, rather than challenging memories of Gielgud, Richardson or Olivier. He might have been a marvellous and unusual Lear, but, when he took the role on radio, it was underwhelming. Though his work in Alan Bennett's plays was superb, he was far less inclined at the end of his career to accept risks as Gielgud - secure in a theatrical dynasty - famously did with Harold Pinter, David Storey and Julian Mitchell. He was always a bit of a social upstart in an English theatre world full of great families, a self-made actor with no advantages, dependent on a very spiritual stillness and charisma. When I first met him in the mid-1970s, he had a slightly grand shyness off-stage. Yet, of all the great British stage actors, his was the busiest film career, for which his modest way of acting was flawless. Guinness was not just an actor. He was good at drawing and did a really charming, diffident design for his own Christmas cards each year. Like Caruso, he was a natural at caricatures, especially of himself. His handwriting was beautiful. He was a very able author. Just before the war, his stage version of Great Expectations - later the basis of David Lean's film - had been directed by George Devine. His adaptation of The Brothers Karamazov, directed by Peter Brook in 1946, marked his return to the stage, as Mitya, after war service in the Royal Navy. He had joined as a rating in 1941, been commissioned in 1942 and commanded a landing-craft ferrying supplies to the Yugoslav partisans. He also appeared in the West End during the war, in Rattigan's Bomber Command play, Flare Path. After playing Herbert Pocket, in Lean's Great Expectations (1946), and Fagin, in Oliver Twist (1948), Guinness went on to a series of glorious Ealing comedies - perhaps most memorably as the bankteller-turned-robber Henry Holland in Charles Crichton's The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), for which he was nominated for an Oscar, and as the criminal Professor Marcus, in Alexander Mackendrick's The Ladykillers (1955). His greatest film role was probably Colonel Nicholson, in Lean's The Bridge On The River Kwai (1957), where his quintessentially English stiff upper lip under dreadful Japanese maltreatment and, eventually, obsessive unreasonableness, won him a best actor Oscar and numerous other prizes. Further work included the artist Gulley Jimson, in The Horse's Mouth (1958) - another Oscar nomination - with his own screenplay based on Joyce Carey's novel. In 1959, he starred in Carol Reed's Our Man In Havana, and a year later gave a brilliantly unpleasant Scottish impersonation of an irascible soldier in Tunes Of Glory. It was not followed by many more good film starring roles, and Guinness settled mostly for lucrative supporting parts in films like The Quiller Memorandum (1966), The Comedians (1967) and Cromwell (1970). Yet some of those supporting roles were distinguished - Prince Feisal, in Lean's Lawrence Of Arabia (1962), General Yefgrav Zhivago, in Doctor Zhivago (1965), and Professor Godbole, in A Passage to India (1984). In Anthony Mann's The Fall Of The Roman Empire (1964), Guinness's Marcus Aurelius was one of the film's few redeeming features. He was again nominated for an Oscar with Star Wars (1977), and six years later appeared in its sequel, Return Of The Jedi. Yet another Oscar nomination followed his appearance as Dorrit, in Christine Edzard's epic adaptation of Dickens's Little Dorrit (1988). At the end of the 1970s, he achieved a new fame with his television appearances in the BBC2 adaptations of Le Carr\u00e9's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People. These works were effectively his screen monument, and for which he achieved Bafta awards. Guinness was a charming, fascinating and elusive companion. He did not enjoy playing the star, though he liked the respect he got when visiting famous restaurants. From the mid-1950s, he lived in a modest way outside Petersfield, in Hampshire, with a large garden that much occupied his wife, Merula, whom he had married in 1938. He had a small circle of particular friends, many outside the theatre. For years, he and Merula were close to Rachel Kempson and Michael Redgrave. If one visited him in his dressing room in the West End in the 1970s, one might find a surprisingly broad collection of people there, many of whom were never destined to discover what the others' link with the great actor might be. He preferred to keep his friends separate; he was a one-to-one person. He liked good food and drink. His favourite London hotel was the Connaught, with its superb cuisine. He was not a club man. He was knighted in 1959 and made a Companion of Honour in 1994. Anybody outside his immediate circle was intrigued by the Guinness enigma. But the reserve through which that attractive generosity and warmth powerfully shone was, for him, an impenetrable and necessary protection. He is survived by Merula and his son, Matthew. Alec Guinness, actor, born April 2 1914; died August 5 2000",

      "bodyText": "President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia apologised to his country yesterday for failing to resolve its myriad crises since taking office, and promised wholesale change to halt what he called the accelerating slide towards national disintegration. In his first state of the nation address to the supreme legislative body since becoming the country's first democratically elected president in October, Mr Wahid cast aside the belligerence of recent months and sought to mend relations with the increasingly hostile legislature, which has been threatening to oust him. The MPs, who are about to investigate him for alleged corruption, applauded the apology but expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of substance in the 85-minute speech. They indicated that they would rebuke but not impeach him, and hinted that his best survival strategy would be to become more of a figurehead. Speaking to the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) on the opening day of its annual 12-day session, Mr Wahid said he had learned from his \"shortcomings and weaknesses\". \"To all the Indonesian people I humbly apologise for being unable to completely solve the prevailing problems during the last 10 months,\" the almost-blind Mr Wahid said in the address, which was read by his cabinet secretary. Once the session was over, he said, he would revamp his cabinet and concentrate himself on foreign affairs. \"I will leave the [domestic] technical matters in the hands of those who know best.\" Mr Wahid has been increasingly criticised for his unpredictable style of government, which involves giving little guidance to ministers and has resulted in policy inertia. He has blamed the government's failings on the fact that he could not choose his ministers but was forced, for the sake of national unity, to accept a coalition of many political interests. The failure was reflected in the president's gloomy analysis of the state of the nation. Widespread and increasing separatist and ethnic violence were threatening to wrench Indonesia apart, he said. \"The dangerous symptoms and currents of national disintegration are getting stronger. Our nation-state is now politically confronted with threats to its territorial and national integrity.\" Adding to the problem, the president said, was the lingering economic crisis, which had \"pulverised our nation\" and \"resulted in the degradation of people's welfare and the deterioration of important economic institutions\". His critics were united in condemning the lack of detail in his address, and his failure to get to grips with the country's problems, but divided on what should be done. Some said more power should be given to Vice-President Megawati Sukarnoputri, others advocated the creation of a first minister and the reduction of the presidency to the role of national figurehead. But despite the president's show of contrition, few analysts believe Mr Wahid is willing to become a figurehead just yet.",
