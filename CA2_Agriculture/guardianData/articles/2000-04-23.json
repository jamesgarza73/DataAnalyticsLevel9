      "bodyText": "David Blunkett, the education secretary, was warned yesterday of a summer of legal and industrial conflict if he pushes ahead with plans to pay a \u00a32,000 bonus in September to experienced teachers whose pupils score well in national tests and exams. After a stormy debate at the National Union of Teachers' annual conference in Harrogate, the union's general secretary, Doug McAvoy, said he was confident there would be a ballot on a work to rule, involving a boycott of duties going beyond teachers' basic contractual commitments. This is expected to threaten sports coaching, drama clubs, school trips and other initiatives adding value to children's education during the summer term. Graham Lane, Labour education chairman of the Local Government Association, forecast a rash of legal action from disappointed teachers who thought they had been unfairly denied the performance bonus. When local education authorities were forced to defend themselves before employment tribunals they would have to name Mr Blunkett as a co-respondent. The authorities would have no responsibility for decisions about performance pay increases that were made by headteachers and assessors appointed by the government. \"If teachers said they had been denied a performance increase for reasons of sexism or racism, we could face unlimited fines. The only way we could sort this out would be to name Mr Blunkett as a co-respondent. This would cause the whole scheme to unravel,\" Mr Lane said. The warnings came after NUT moderates appeared to have outsmarted leftwingers trying to win conference support for a one-day national strike against performance pay. Debate on tactics for pursuing a \u00a32,000 pay increase for all teachers without performance strings attached ran out of time and the key votes may not be reached before the conference closes tomorrow. There was strong pressure from delegates who thought Mr McAvoy was not robust enough in defending the profession against a pay scheme that they claim would threaten teamwork and discriminate against newly qualified teachers. Bob Sulatycki, a teacher from Kensington and Chelsea, accused the general secretary of collaborating with ministers by sending out guidance encouraging teachers to apply for performance pay if they were eligible. \"We are 200,000 strong,\" he said. \"We have the strength if we are prepared to use it. A one-day strike would transform the mood. We can win parental support on this.\" Mary Compton, a teacher from Radnor, won a standing ovation after she said: \"The strike weapon is as much to protect children as teachers. The only way this will become a live issue is if we get off our knees and take some action. \"If we can't fight to defend teachers against the greatest threat to the profession in our lifetime, then what are we in a union for? League tables have set school against school. Now performance pay will set teacher against teacher. Don't let them do it.\" Mr McAvoy said after the debate: \"It is finely balanced whether conference will back strike action.\" But even if it did, the executive would have to decide whether to go ahead without overwhelming support from teachers at the grassroots. It was \"almost certain\" there would be a ballot for industrial action short of a strike. On Saturday, the conference voted for local industrial action to protect teachers refusing to inform on each other to help headteachers with performance reviews. About 400 delegates walked out in protest at the start of a speech by Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, and others persistently heckled her. Mr McAvoy told them: \"I am not aided one bit by heckling, shouting and booing. You boo the good as much as you boo the bad.\" Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said the NUT was bringing teachers into disrepute by threatening industrial action against performance pay while encouraging its members to apply for it. \"That's utter nonsense,\" he said. \"If you decide to go for it, it seems daft to take industrial action against it.\"",

The action group has recruited legal advice for the submission of five resolutions. \"The company belongs to with-profit policyholders who would be better off with conversion,\" Mr Woollard said. \"Clearly the company has too much capital, they have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and they are not using it.\" The board will be forced to call a meeting if 50 qualifying policyholders back the resolution.",

In his Easter sermon to his parliamentary flock, the Rector of Downing Street tells his MPs that they must abase themselves before our Lord, the voter. It is time for New Labour to descend to its knees. 'We have to tell people that a lot has been done, but we also accept with humility that there is a lot more to do.'</p> <p>Humility? Good heavens, what next? Perhaps we can anticipate the spectacle of the Prime Minister leading a shaven-headed Cabinet along Whitehall as they scourge their backs with rolled-up copies of the latest polling data from Millbank HQ. John Prescott will say three Hail Marys, though I suspect the Mouth of the Humber would express himself more industrially, for each cone every frustrated driver encounters on the congested roads this bank-holiday weekend.</p> <p>Alan Milburn will prostrate himself before every patient who has suffered a cancelled operation or delayed appointment. There is a particularly grisly ritual in the Philippines at Easter in which participants parade with crosses to which they are then nailed. Even the most passionate supporter of freedom of information and the most determined champion of the right to trial by jury would not be so uncharitable as to wish such an awful fate on Jack Straw.</p> <p>Still, for Tony Blair, so it has seemed lately, you can't have too much of repentance. He used the pages of this newspaper just a fortnight ago to make a full confession that he had strayed from the path of righteousness when he adulterated devolution. The Prime Minister pledges - we have his Holy oath on this - that he will go away and sin no more.</p> <p>This is passing strange. Margaret Thatcher, whose clarity of purpose and tungsten skin has often attracted the present Prime Minister's open admiration, never knowingly admitted to a mistake. Well, just the one - entering the Exchange Rate Mechanism. And that was all the fault, she said, of her other error - John Major. He wasn't a man given to apologising, either, not even for Black Wednesday. Even in retirement, Ted Heath remained a granite monument of self-justification. When rats were gnawing through the piles of stinking refuse in Leicester Square, Jim Callaghan returned from the Caribbean to declare that he could see 'no signs of mounting crisis'. Harold Macmillan didn't go into an election telling the country: 'You've Never Had It So Sorry.'</p> <p>What's more, compared with the record of that crew, Tony Blair has nothing to apologise for. He hasn't presided over an economic calamity. He hasn't perpetrated a poll tax. He hasn't switched off the lights. He hasn't left the dead unburied. By the standards of most occupants of Number 10, he is presiding over a highly successful and stable administration with several large achievements already to its name. Conservative Central Office, so a leaked memo reveals, agrees with everyone else that Tony Blair will win his second term with a majority which, even if reduced, will be of a size to attract the envy of most Prime Ministers.</p> <p>So why are we suddenly so 'umble, ever so 'umble at Number 10? It's partly because Blair genuinely acknowledges a mistake over Rhodri Morgan in Wales. He doesn't think he was wrong about Ken Livingstone and still expects to be proved right about how he will perform as Mayor of London, but does, at least privately, concede that New Labour made a monumental mess of handling the newt-charmer.</p> <p>I think the Prime Minister has also, if belatedly, realised that the Government has become the victim of its own spin. The bombastic school of presentation - billions spent on this, billions spent on that, these billions too often funny money produced by creative accountancy - rebounded badly by inflating expectations which could never be fulfilled. A little maturer and wiser now, New Labour may be learning to treat the voters as grown-ups who know that difficult things with years of inherited problems, like health, education and transport, do not get solved overnight.</p> <p>There is more to these apologias than that. The Prime Minister's exercise in humility is also an illustration of Tony Blair the electoral cynic. His pollsters have been telling him for some months that he is regarded as a haughty control-freakist. He tried to dispel that notion in his last party conference speech when he told us that, though he walked with Presidents and Kings, he was just a Dad with kids at the end of the day. It clearly didn't do the trick then. So he's having another go now at deflating the perceived size of his own ego.</p> <p>Oddly enough, it is nearly all perception. The truth about Tony Blair is that, as Prime Ministers go, he is a man pretty untouched by arrogance. He may go swivel-eyed in the end - quite a lot of them do - but he's not power-addled yet. Here's one of the striking reasons he is not like Margaret Thatcher. When arrogance was attached to her, and the label was applied very early on, she just got more so, and won three elections in a row before hubris finally became nemesis. Thatcher couldn't give a stuff if people thought she was arrogant. She correctly calculated that, though the voters might moan about it, they didn't really care about it.</p> <p>Whereas she took it as a compliment to her strength, Tony Blair reacts with fright at being called arrogant, not something you would do if you truly were. So another aspect here is Tony Blair, the curiously insecure, who is already working himself into a fret about a general election he isn't compelled to call for another two years.</p> <p>Incidentally, I'm not utterly convinced by the universal assumption that he will call that election in May 2001. I guess it to be just as likely that, following the Thatcher pattern of elections, he'd want to wait to see that year's local election results before steeling himself for the big one in June or July.</p> <p>For Blair is a bit of a nervous Nelly about elections, a reflex which served him well until the last one. He privately predicted every Labour defeat, including the one that surprised most people in his party in 1992. The election he got wrong was May 1997. He anticipated winning, but never by so much. He must expect to win next time, but the fear rippling through the inner commands of the Government is that a combination of a high turn-out by the Tory core and apathy among Labour voters could drastically reduce his majority.</p> <p>New Labour is getting into a terrific, energy-sapping twist about this. I hear some people around the Prime Minister arguing that New Labour's biggest problem is Tory unpopularity. If only, they sigh, the Conservatives weren't so unelectable, then William Hague would present a threat plausible enough to frighten natural Labour people to the polls. Get it? The better Hague does, the better Blair does. Well, these people do keep mobile phones close to their heads for many hours of the day.</p> <p>You can do this sort of tortuous theorising until you disappear up the fundament of your own focus group.

      "bodyText": "You can rarely fault his timing. At this moment in the Christian calendar when we contemplate sin and repentance, Tony Blair is in penitential mode. In his Easter sermon to his parliamentary flock, the Rector of Downing Street tells his MPs that they must abase themselves before our Lord, the voter. It is time for New Labour to descend to its knees. 'We have to tell people that a lot has been done, but we also accept with humility that there is a lot more to do.' Humility? Good heavens, what next? Perhaps we can anticipate the spectacle of the Prime Minister leading a shaven-headed Cabinet along Whitehall as they scourge their backs with rolled-up copies of the latest polling data from Millbank HQ. John Prescott will say three Hail Marys, though I suspect the Mouth of the Humber would express himself more industrially, for each cone every frustrated driver encounters on the congested roads this bank-holiday weekend. Alan Milburn will prostrate himself before every patient who has suffered a cancelled operation or delayed appointment. There is a particularly grisly ritual in the Philippines at Easter in which participants parade with crosses to which they are then nailed. Even the most passionate supporter of freedom of information and the most determined champion of the right to trial by jury would not be so uncharitable as to wish such an awful fate on Jack Straw. Still, for Tony Blair, so it has seemed lately, you can't have too much of repentance. He used the pages of this newspaper just a fortnight ago to make a full confession that he had strayed from the path of righteousness when he adulterated devolution. The Prime Minister pledges - we have his Holy oath on this - that he will go away and sin no more. This is passing strange. Margaret Thatcher, whose clarity of purpose and tungsten skin has often attracted the present Prime Minister's open admiration, never knowingly admitted to a mistake. Well, just the one - entering the Exchange Rate Mechanism. And that was all the fault, she said, of her other error - John Major. He wasn't a man given to apologising, either, not even for Black Wednesday. Even in retirement, Ted Heath remained a granite monument of self-justification. When rats were gnawing through the piles of stinking refuse in Leicester Square, Jim Callaghan returned from the Caribbean to declare that he could see 'no signs of mounting crisis'. Harold Macmillan didn't go into an election telling the country: 'You've Never Had It So Sorry.' What's more, compared with the record of that crew, Tony Blair has nothing to apologise for. He hasn't presided over an economic calamity. He hasn't perpetrated a poll tax. He hasn't switched off the lights. He hasn't left the dead unburied. By the standards of most occupants of Number 10, he is presiding over a highly successful and stable administration with several large achievements already to its name. Conservative Central Office, so a leaked memo reveals, agrees with everyone else that Tony Blair will win his second term with a majority which, even if reduced, will be of a size to attract the envy of most Prime Ministers. So why are we suddenly so 'umble, ever so 'umble at Number 10? It's partly because Blair genuinely acknowledges a mistake over Rhodri Morgan in Wales. He doesn't think he was wrong about Ken Livingstone and still expects to be proved right about how he will perform as Mayor of London, but does, at least privately, concede that New Labour made a monumental mess of handling the newt-charmer. I think the Prime Minister has also, if belatedly, realised that the Government has become the victim of its own spin. The bombastic school of presentation - billions spent on this, billions spent on that, these billions too often funny money produced by creative accountancy - rebounded badly by inflating expectations which could never be fulfilled. A little maturer and wiser now, New Labour may be learning to treat the voters as grown-ups who know that difficult things with years of inherited problems, like health, education and transport, do not get solved overnight. There is more to these apologias than that. The Prime Minister's exercise in humility is also an illustration of Tony Blair the electoral cynic. His pollsters have been telling him for some months that he is regarded as a haughty control-freakist. He tried to dispel that notion in his last party conference speech when he told us that, though he walked with Presidents and Kings, he was just a Dad with kids at the end of the day. It clearly didn't do the trick then. So he's having another go now at deflating the perceived size of his own ego. Oddly enough, it is nearly all perception. The truth about Tony Blair is that, as Prime Ministers go, he is a man pretty untouched by arrogance. He may go swivel-eyed in the end - quite a lot of them do - but he's not power-addled yet. Here's one of the striking reasons he is not like Margaret Thatcher.

Whereas she took it as a compliment to her strength, Tony Blair reacts with fright at being called arrogant, not something you would do if you truly were. So another aspect here is Tony Blair, the curiously insecure, who is already working himself into a fret about a general election he isn't compelled to call for another two years. Incidentally, I'm not utterly convinced by the universal assumption that he will call that election in May 2001. I guess it to be just as likely that, following the Thatcher pattern of elections, he'd want to wait to see that year's local election results before steeling himself for the big one in June or July.

But a trip to the old country may prove disastrous for some young British Asians, as a growing number fall victim to a disturbing new drugs phenomenon dubbed the 'holiday habit'. Drugs counsellors have also found that when Asian parents discover their children have been using drugs in Britain they panic and send them to family in Pakistan for help, without realising that use of the drug is rife and they are in danger of coming back with an even worse habit. During their visits the young British Asians are often exposed to bargain-basement, readily available supplies of heroin and dangerous pharmaceutical drugs such as morphine and temazepam, according to counsellors in this country. Experts say a gram of pure heroin, which would cost upwards of \u00a3100 in Britain, can change hands in Pakistan for 30p. Drugs charities say the authorities have failed to provide prevention and treatment services for ethnic minority users. A report to be published this month of a conference organised by Scottish drugs charities will highlight the holiday habit and demand more resources for supporting Asian users. There is only one specialist service north of the border, and English services report similar pressures.

      "body": "<p>When I saw President Mugabe in Cairo, I told him of my concern at the breakdown of the rule of law in Zimbabwe. I pressed him to enforce court orders, and to stop the illegal occupation of farms. I warned that failure to do this would encourage a descent into anarchy.</p> <p>Recent events are precisely what I had feared and predicted. Farmers and members of the opposition have been murdered, and farmers' wives and daughters have been raped. Zimbabwe is in danger of sliding into mob rule.</p> <p>Britain's response has been a twin strategy. First, we have taken the lead in mobilising international pressure for the return to the rule of law. Second, we have sought to draw the government of Zimbabwe into a dialogue leading to a peaceful and legal resolution of the crisis.</p> <p>Our approaches have produced universal support from the international community and a rising tide of pressure on Mugabe. The Commonwealth secretary-general, Don McKinnon, shared a platform with me and shared the same demand for a return to the rule of law. He agreed that Zimbabwe must be high on the agenda of Commonwealth Ministers when we meet in a week's time.</p> <p>The European Union has already unanimously supported a British text calling for an end to the illegal occupations and a start to free and fair elections.</p> <p>In Africa itself we have found ready allies in leaders who know only too well that chaos in Zimbabwe is a menace to stability and confidence in Africa. President Obasanjo of Nigeria served long years in arbitrary arrest under military rule and knows the true value of the rule of law and democracy. I greatly appreciate his role in brokering the meeting between Mugabe and me in Cairo, and his recent action in sending his Foreign Minister to Zimbabwe with a personal message.</p> <p>The discussion on the crisis this weekend between the leaders of Southern African states was prompted by my conversation last week with Kofi Annan which led to our approach to their regional organisation, the Southern African Development Community.</p> <p>I spoke to President Chissano of Mozambique and President Mbeki's Foreign Minister before their visit and gave them a clear message for Mugabe that Britain is willing to help with land reform.</p> <p>Moreover, we are ready to take the lead in coordinating international funding, involving our partners in Europe and the World Bank. But nobody is going to help with the programme of confiscation backed by murder.</p> <p>There must first be an end to the illegal occupations and the violence they have produced.</p> <p>It must also be a fair programme which helps the rural poor who have no land. Answers in the Zimbabwean parliament show that half the farms reallocated in the past three years have gone to public officials with the right connections, not to farmers with no land.

      "bodyText": "When I saw President Mugabe in Cairo, I told him of my concern at the breakdown of the rule of law in Zimbabwe. I pressed him to enforce court orders, and to stop the illegal occupation of farms. I warned that failure to do this would encourage a descent into anarchy. Recent events are precisely what I had feared and predicted. Farmers and members of the opposition have been murdered, and farmers' wives and daughters have been raped. Zimbabwe is in danger of sliding into mob rule. Britain's response has been a twin strategy. First, we have taken the lead in mobilising international pressure for the return to the rule of law. Second, we have sought to draw the government of Zimbabwe into a dialogue leading to a peaceful and legal resolution of the crisis. Our approaches have produced universal support from the international community and a rising tide of pressure on Mugabe. The Commonwealth secretary-general, Don McKinnon, shared a platform with me and shared the same demand for a return to the rule of law. He agreed that Zimbabwe must be high on the agenda of Commonwealth Ministers when we meet in a week's time. The European Union has already unanimously supported a British text calling for an end to the illegal occupations and a start to free and fair elections. In Africa itself we have found ready allies in leaders who know only too well that chaos in Zimbabwe is a menace to stability and confidence in Africa. President Obasanjo of Nigeria served long years in arbitrary arrest under military rule and knows the true value of the rule of law and democracy. I greatly appreciate his role in brokering the meeting between Mugabe and me in Cairo, and his recent action in sending his Foreign Minister to Zimbabwe with a personal message. The discussion on the crisis this weekend between the leaders of Southern African states was prompted by my conversation last week with Kofi Annan which led to our approach to their regional organisation, the Southern African Development Community. I spoke to President Chissano of Mozambique and President Mbeki's Foreign Minister before their visit and gave them a clear message for Mugabe that Britain is willing to help with land reform. Moreover, we are ready to take the lead in coordinating international funding, involving our partners in Europe and the World Bank. But nobody is going to help with the programme of confiscation backed by murder. There must first be an end to the illegal occupations and the violence they have produced. It must also be a fair programme which helps the rural poor who have no land. Answers in the Zimbabwean parliament show that half the farms reallocated in the past three years have gone to public officials with the right connections, not to farmers with no land. We can help with land reform only if the programme is helping to reduce poverty. We will work for a solution. Confrontation is not the course being pressed on us by opposition leaders or by those most at risk from the thugs. When I speak to the farmers' leaders, they urge Britain to keep our rhetoric 'cool and level-headed'. If we turn up the temperature, it is they who will feel the heat. The leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, Morgan Tsvangirai, has publicly warned us against making Mugabe the martyr, which he craves for his own electoral calculations. When I saw Tsvangirai, he told me that he had also urged on the Conservatives bipartisan support for a solution. Calls to end all aid are particularly counter-productive. What is the sense in stopping Aids projects, for example, in a country where a quarter of the population are HIV-positive? It would hurt the people, not Mugabe. It might even convince them that Mugabe is right in his campaign to convince them that Britain is the problem, not his policies. I cannot know in advance whether the Zimbabwean delegation that comes here on Thursday will be looking for a solution. If they are, we can together agree on the principles that would end the occupations and restart land reform. If they do not, they will be condemning their own country to more violence, more economic decay, and to isolation even within Africa.",

      "body": "<p>When they came for Richard Chadya he knew what to do. As the thugs battered on the front door of his tiny tin-roofed cottage Chadya, 37, a would-be politician, slipped out of a back window and ran swiftly through the dark, dusty streets of his township to its post office. There, he knew, was a deep basement where he would be safe.</p> <p>A week later he escaped - hidden in the back of The Observer' s car for a hair-raising hour-long high-speed dash through 'bandit country'. Now he is 130 miles away in a safe-house in the capital, Harare. Chadya, who hoped to win his home town of Karoi for the newly formed Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), is still shaken by his ordeal. He is worried about his wife and family who are still stranded there. But more than anything he is bitter that the violence is winning.</p> <p>The thugs who came for Chadya were from the ruling Zanu-PF party. Little more than a vehicle for President Robert Mugabe, they have been in power for 20 years and hold 147 out of 150 seats in parliament. Now, for the first time, Mugabe and his henchmen are threatened by a credible opposition with growing political support. Their reaction has been cal culating and vicious. So far at least 10 people have died, hundreds have been injured, millions of pounds of damage has been done and the country is in chaos. Elections, brought on by Mugabe's failure to win a referendum entrenching his powers in February, may still be months away.</p> <p>Though most of the international press has focused on the attacks on Zimbabwe's white farmers, Chadya and his colleagues in the MDC have suffered a horrific campaign of brutality and intimidation.</p> <p>Last week two party members were burnt alive when their car was petrol-bombed by Zanu-PF supporters. An Observer investigation has established that such attacks are far more widespread than previously thought.</p> <p>MDC activists are routinely followed and threatened with violence, MDC officers' house have been firebombed after rallies and dozens of activists have been abducted and beaten. In three attacks in the south of the country at least 10 party candidates have been hospitalised and scores were injured when a rally in the northern town of Mount Darwin was attacked.</p> <p>In Harare last week a funeral for one of the MDC officers killed in their car was raided by Zanu youths and several mourners were seriously hurt. At least eight MDC activists are now thought to have died.</p> <p>Chadya believes it is only a matter of time until someone is killed in Karoi. Dozens of MDC workers in the town have been badly injured after Zanu-PF spies infiltrated the local party and drew up lists of local members to attack. At least eight MDC activists have been seized, held for days in the Karoi Zanu office and beaten bloody. Others have been taken to the township's 'beerhall' and have had their heads smashed into its walls until they pass out. Armed Zanu activists are conducting house to house searches looking for MDC members and have dug a pit on the outskirts of the town.</p> <p>'They threw all our posters and T-shirts and membership cards into it and burnt them and then they said that next it would be a grave for us,' said Chadya last week.</p> <p>When The Observer arrived in Karoi Chadya was con tacted through a series of mobile phone calls to intermediaries. The atmosphere in the town was tense and Chadya was terrified of emerging from his hiding place. Gangs had formed in the streets each night, he said later, chanting songs about cutting off his head. Finally - after a destination had been agreed - Chadya was rushed by two friends into the car and we drove off, fast, on the road south. Clutching a plastic bag with pathetically few possessions, he lay flat below the rear seats as we sped past groups of Zanu-PF men on the verges of the road.</p> <p>What would happen if they saw us and stopped us? we asked. 'For all of us, it would be the end of our problems,' Chadya replied grimly.</p> <p>Within an hour of handing Chadya over to friends at a petrol station 50 miles away, we headed back to Karoi. We had arranged to spend the night in the relative safety of the home of Kelvin Weare, who runs an agricultural machinery hire business and a makeshift security network for farmers. Karoi is in prime farming country. Beyond the black townships on its outskirts enormous fields, lakes and patches of scrubby bush stretch to a huge horizon.</p> <p>Seventy per cent of the best agricultural land in Zimbabwe is owned by 4,200 white farmers - a minuscule proportion of the total population. Their whitewashed ranch-style homesteads with swimming pools and tennis courts and immaculate lawns dominate the landscape. Close by are the 'compounds' where the farmworkers - often paid less than 60p a day - live in rows of small huts. In recent weeks more than half the 230 farms around Karoi have been invaded by squatters. In some cases the farmers have been allowed back on to their land, in others they are still living with relatives and watching and waiting.</p> <p>The farmers are caught in a political trap that is only partly of their own making. Almost all support the MDC and many have given substantial amounts of money to fund the party's campaign against Mugabe.</p> <p>The President has been incensed by such activities and is worried that the farmworkers will follow their bosses' examples and vote for the opposition. This could swing crucial rural districts - many of the urban centres are already MDC strongholds - against the government.</p> <p>To forestall any such development Mugabe, who is 76, has launched the carefully orchestrated campaign that has sparked such violence in recent weeks. It is no coincidence that the farms targeted by the flying columns of Zanu thugs have been in strong MDC areas. Farmers singled out for attacks - such as David Stevens, who died last weekend - were members of the opposition.</p> <p>By raising tensions over land - an unresolved issue since Zimbabwe won its independence from Britain in 1980 - Zanu also hopes to win back votes that they have been losing due to their dire mismanagement of the economy. And, as a last resort, the instability could provide a good excuse for Mugabe to postpone the elections by declaring a state of emergency.</p> <p>'This bastard knows what he is doing,' said Kelvin Weare in a break between fielding calls on two radios and two phones. 'People are really scared. He really has us under the cosh.' The farmers are a rugged breed, with their bush hats and moustaches and tans, and are committed to their way of life. They believe their possession of so much of Zimbabwe's best land is justified.</p> <p>'I bought this land like anybody could have done,' said David Younghusband, who farms tobacco for the West on his 3,200 acre farm on the outskirts of Karoi. 'The blacks just do not have the capital or the expertise to run big commercially viable farms like this. Many former white-owned farms that have been taken over have been ruined. We don't oppose land reform in theory. We just want it done properly.'</p> <p>But the white community is very nervous. The deaths of two white farmers and the rape of two women last week have prompted an exodus from many threatened areas. The British High Commission has been inundated with applications for visas and new passports and the price of guns has reportedly trebled in Harare.</p> <p>In Karoi the air is thick with rumours. Until late at night Weare keeps in touch with farmers in outlying areas. Reports of attacks on loyal farmworkers are radioed in and guards allocated to certain districts.</p> <p>At 10.30pm the radio comes alive with the news that another farmer has been shot. It isn't true but the anxiety doesn't die away. The sound of drums has been heard from a nearby village and no one knows what it means.</p> <p>We find out when at 5.30am the radio crackles back into life. A nearby farm has just been invaded by a group of 200 heavily armed squatters. The farmer is calling for help. Some of the invaders are Zanu-PF, others are just locals with a grievance. They are massed at the farm gates and when they see us approaching start to wave their weapons - spiked clubs and metal rods - and make the three-fingered Zanu salute. Having had spears thrown at us by squatters earlier in the week we reverse away fast.</p> <p>But not all the squatters are mindless thugs. Though the invasions are usually led by Mugabe's henchmen (of whom some are veterans of the country's liberation struggle), Zimbabwe's crippled economy means that many are just ordinary people trying to better miserable lives.</p> <p>On the outskirts of Harare squatters have taken over around a dozen farms. The 1,000-acre Bellepaise estate was 'invaded' two weeks ago. Now only a few squatters - and none of the thugs - are left.</p> <p>Standing on his newly pegged-out 20 by 30 metre patch of clipped grass, Leonard Chakumba, 35, described how Zanu activists had come to his ragged township, a mile away, 10 days ago and announced that they were going to take over the farm.</p> <p>'They said that anyone who wants some land should come with them,' Chakumba said, wiping his brow on the sleeve of his orange Zimbabwe football shirt. 'I am unemployed and have nowhere to live so I thought it was a good opportunity. I know it is wrong to take someone else's property but life is a struggle for me.'</p> <p>Though the Zanu men who led him into the fields have long since been bused off to organise invasions in other areas of the country, Chakumba remains on his tiny patch of land. 'I am not political. I am just hoping for a better life,' he said.</p> <p>Not far away Antonio Banda was carefully trimming back the growth on a small 400sq m plot. His wife, Sylvia, was working despite having their two-week-old baby strapped to her back. Their two small sons played in the dust. 'We are hoping to plant some vegetables here because we have no room at our home. Maybe we can sell them and get some meat,' Banda said. 'I work as a watchman and only earn 640 Zimbabwe dollars (\u00a311) a month so we don't have enough food. If I am lucky maybe I can send my sons to school.'</p> <p>Mugabe is a clever operator. He knows the land question condenses all the other issues into a single flashpoint and he has exploited it ruthlessly.</p> <p>For the white farmers the battle now being waged is about preserving a way of life; the landless and the poor see a chance to better themselves; the thugs see an opportunity for fighting and looting and the politicians see a chance to win power. But, as Zimbabwe staggers closer to anarchy, everyone is losing sight of peace.</p>",

Though most of the international press has focused on the attacks on Zimbabwe's white farmers, Chadya and his colleagues in the MDC have suffered a horrific campaign of brutality and intimidation. Last week two party members were burnt alive when their car was petrol-bombed by Zanu-PF supporters. An Observer investigation has established that such attacks are far more widespread than previously thought. MDC activists are routinely followed and threatened with violence, MDC officers' house have been firebombed after rallies and dozens of activists have been abducted and beaten. In three attacks in the south of the country at least 10 party candidates have been hospitalised and scores were injured when a rally in the northern town of Mount Darwin was attacked. In Harare last week a funeral for one of the MDC officers killed in their car was raided by Zanu youths and several mourners were seriously hurt. At least eight MDC activists are now thought to have died. Chadya believes it is only a matter of time until someone is killed in Karoi. Dozens of MDC workers in the town have been badly injured after Zanu-PF spies infiltrated the local party and drew up lists of local members to attack. At least eight MDC activists have been seized, held for days in the Karoi Zanu office and beaten bloody. Others have been taken to the township's 'beerhall' and have had their heads smashed into its walls until they pass out. Armed Zanu activists are conducting house to house searches looking for MDC members and have dug a pit on the outskirts of the town. 'They threw all our posters and T-shirts and membership cards into it and burnt them and then they said that next it would be a grave for us,' said Chadya last week. When The Observer arrived in Karoi Chadya was con tacted through a series of mobile phone calls to intermediaries. The atmosphere in the town was tense and Chadya was terrified of emerging from his hiding place. Gangs had formed in the streets each night, he said later, chanting songs about cutting off his head. Finally - after a destination had been agreed - Chadya was rushed by two friends into the car and we drove off, fast, on the road south. Clutching a plastic bag with pathetically few possessions, he lay flat below the rear seats as we sped past groups of Zanu-PF men on the verges of the road. What would happen if they saw us and stopped us? we asked. 'For all of us, it would be the end of our problems,' Chadya replied grimly. Within an hour of handing Chadya over to friends at a petrol station 50 miles away, we headed back to Karoi. We had arranged to spend the night in the relative safety of the home of Kelvin Weare, who runs an agricultural machinery hire business and a makeshift security network for farmers. Karoi is in prime farming country. Beyond the black townships on its outskirts enormous fields, lakes and patches of scrubby bush stretch to a huge horizon. Seventy per cent of the best agricultural land in Zimbabwe is owned by 4,200 white farmers - a minuscule proportion of the total population. Their whitewashed ranch-style homesteads with swimming pools and tennis courts and immaculate lawns dominate the landscape. Close by are the 'compounds' where the farmworkers - often paid less than 60p a day - live in rows of small huts. In recent weeks more than half the 230 farms around Karoi have been invaded by squatters. In some cases the farmers have been allowed back on to their land, in others they are still living with relatives and watching and waiting. The farmers are caught in a political trap that is only partly of their own making. Almost all support the MDC and many have given substantial amounts of money to fund the party's campaign against Mugabe. The President has been incensed by such activities and is worried that the farmworkers will follow their bosses' examples and vote for the opposition. This could swing crucial rural districts - many of the urban centres are already MDC strongholds - against the government. To forestall any such development Mugabe, who is 76, has launched the carefully orchestrated campaign that has sparked such violence in recent weeks. It is no coincidence that the farms targeted by the flying columns of Zanu thugs have been in strong MDC areas. Farmers singled out for attacks - such as David Stevens, who died last weekend - were members of the opposition. By raising tensions over land - an unresolved issue since Zimbabwe won its independence from Britain in 1980 - Zanu also hopes to win back votes that they have been losing due to their dire mismanagement of the economy. And, as a last resort, the instability could provide a good excuse for Mugabe to postpone the elections by declaring a state of emergency. 'This bastard knows what he is doing,' said Kelvin Weare in a break between fielding calls on two radios and two phones. 'People are really scared. He really has us under the cosh.' The farmers are a rugged breed, with their bush hats and moustaches and tans, and are committed to their way of life. They believe their possession of so much of Zimbabwe's best land is justified. 'I bought this land like anybody could have done,' said David Younghusband, who farms tobacco for the West on his 3,200 acre farm on the outskirts of Karoi. 'The blacks just do not have the capital or the expertise to run big commercially viable farms like this. Many former white-owned farms that have been taken over have been ruined. We don't oppose land reform in theory. We just want it done properly.' But the white community is very nervous. The deaths of two white farmers and the rape of two women last week have prompted an exodus from many threatened areas. The British High Commission has been inundated with applications for visas and new passports and the price of guns has reportedly trebled in Harare. In Karoi the air is thick with rumours. Until late at night Weare keeps in touch with farmers in outlying areas. Reports of attacks on loyal farmworkers are radioed in and guards allocated to certain districts. At 10.30pm the radio comes alive with the news that another farmer has been shot. It isn't true but the anxiety doesn't die away. The sound of drums has been heard from a nearby village and no one knows what it means. We find out when at 5.30am the radio crackles back into life. A nearby farm has just been invaded by a group of 200 heavily armed squatters. The farmer is calling for help. Some of the invaders are Zanu-PF, others are just locals with a grievance. They are massed at the farm gates and when they see us approaching start to wave their weapons - spiked clubs and metal rods - and make the three-fingered Zanu salute. Having had spears thrown at us by squatters earlier in the week we reverse away fast. But not all the squatters are mindless thugs. Though the invasions are usually led by Mugabe's henchmen (of whom some are veterans of the country's liberation struggle), Zimbabwe's crippled economy means that many are just ordinary people trying to better miserable lives. On the outskirts of Harare squatters have taken over around a dozen farms. The 1,000-acre Bellepaise estate was 'invaded' two weeks ago. Now only a few squatters - and none of the thugs - are left. Standing on his newly pegged-out 20 by 30 metre patch of clipped grass, Leonard Chakumba, 35, described how Zanu activists had come to his ragged township, a mile away, 10 days ago and announced that they were going to take over the farm. 'They said that anyone who wants some land should come with them,' Chakumba said, wiping his brow on the sleeve of his orange Zimbabwe football shirt. 'I am unemployed and have nowhere to live so I thought it was a good opportunity. I know it is wrong to take someone else's property but life is a struggle for me.' Though the Zanu men who led him into the fields have long since been bused off to organise invasions in other areas of the country, Chakumba remains on his tiny patch of land. 'I am not political. I am just hoping for a better life,' he said. Not far away Antonio Banda was carefully trimming back the growth on a small 400sq m plot. His wife, Sylvia, was working despite having their two-week-old baby strapped to her back. Their two small sons played in the dust. 'We are hoping to plant some vegetables here because we have no room at our home. Maybe we can sell them and get some meat,' Banda said. 'I work as a watchman and only earn 640 Zimbabwe dollars (\u00a311) a month so we don't have enough food. If I am lucky maybe I can send my sons to school.' Mugabe is a clever operator. He knows the land question condenses all the other issues into a single flashpoint and he has exploited it ruthlessly. For the white farmers the battle now being waged is about preserving a way of life; the landless and the poor see a chance to better themselves; the thugs see an opportunity for fighting and looting and the politicians see a chance to win power. But, as Zimbabwe staggers closer to anarchy, everyone is losing sight of peace.",

Copies of the book were withdrawn by Suhrkamp-Verlag, the German publisher, during last year's Frankfurt book fair. After the work was first challenged by a Swiss journalist, Daniel Ganzfried, in 1998, research commissioned by Suhrkamp and Does-sekker's agent appeared to back up the allegations that the author presented a fictitious childhood as an orphan, and was neither Latvian nor Jewish. For more than a year Ganzfried cast doubt on the account, starting a high-profile debate in the interna tional press. The book received Jewish literary awards in the US and France. Doessekker made speaking tours in the US as a guest of the Holocaust memorial museum. Writing as Binjamin Wilkomirski, which he claimed to be his original identity, Doessekker described the horrors of Auschwitz and Majdanek death camps and how he saw his father beaten to death. The bulk of the evidence presented by his critics indicates that Doessekker was indeed adopted, but was born in Biel, Switzerland, on 12 February 1941 as Bruno Grosjean to a single mother, a Christian. He was brought up during the Second World War by his adoptive family, the Doessekkers, near Z\u00fcrich. The publisher's subsequent research is said to have shown that Bruno did not leave neutral Switzerland during the war. The Z\u00fcrich prosecutor has questioned Doessekker, but declined to give further details on the case.",

If the whole book is an elegy, it turns all the while, stubbornly, gratefully, towards life. </p> <p>There's no plot as such. Chick, the narrator, an elderly writer, played a part in making Abe Ravelstein, a rather younger and distinctly idiosyncratic professor of philosophy, into a figure of world eminence by suggesting he put down his ideas in book form. Originally this was a financial stratagem - the advance would go some way to staving off Ravelstein's chronic and proliferating debts - but in fact he produced a stunning polemical book, which made him rich and influenced those thoughtful leaders Thatcher and Reagan. </p> <p>When Ravelstein was dying of Aids complications, he made Chick agree to write a biographical sketch of him. Ravelstein isn't linear enough to be the promised eulogy (six years after the death Chick has still to write it). Instead, it testifies to the depth of the fierce, late-blooming friendship that prompted the request. </p> <p>A meditative structure allows for the legitimate presence of repetition, refinement of insight. But if there is sometimes an impression of energy being conserved at the heart of the book, then it is lavishly expended at the edges. A huge, peripheral forcefulness throws off brilliant formulations: 'He looked a lot like a big sandstone bluff with an overhang of bleached grass.' The figure on whom this description is bestowed is less than a minor character, hailed and bidden farewell in the course of two paragraphs. </p> <p>There's a strong element of drawing from life in the portrait of Abe Ravelstein (as the New York Times reported last week). Bellow's friend Allan Bloom did indeed stir things up with his book The Closing of the American Mind, was indeed f\u00eated and vilified for pronouncing education in his country dead.</p> <p>But if this is a roman \u00e0 clef, it isn't undertaken in the usual spirit. Though there is plenty of intimate detail given, which would seem jarring in a memoir (the fact of Ravelstein's increased libido in illness, for instance), there is discretion also. Bloom was a controversial enough figure, but in the eyes of the world certainly a lesser celebrity than Bellow, Nobel laureate and survivor. The choice of fictional space over any other kind enables Bellow to step down, for the duration of the pious though not exactly reverent task, from being Saul Bellow. The alterity of 'Chick' is marginal - he's not a full alternative persona. The abdication of a set identity is the important move, not the assumption of another. </p> <p>Chick specifically disowns a last-days-of-Socrates atmosphere, but can't altogether avoid it. Ravelstein, who had previously divided his loyalties between Athens and Jerusalem, at the end of his life favours Jerusalem, dwelling on religious questions rather than politics. </p> <p>What Ravelstein sought from Chick was a portrait, not an exposition or a critique, but the Bloomian repertoire of values and aphorisms ('American nihilism is nihilism without the abyss' being a fine example) necessarily features. Chick mentions in passing Ravelstein's opinion that a biological drive towards stability, 'together with a mass of other things', disables women for the serious study of philosophy. In this respect, Ravelstein is, if anything, less stern than his model - Bloom extended a doctrinaire exclusion to children of divorce, listeners to rock music and those no longer virgins, since the teacher-pupil relationship is Eros sublimated, upstaged and ruined by any physical expression. </p> <p>Chick sees in Ravelstein an unsparing intelligence housed in 'a bald, cranial watchtower', and a loving stricture which insists on wrestling reality to the mat. His friend's life has 'more inner structure' than his. Chick's own sensibility is less confrontational - but then 'taking note' rather than passing judgment is part of his 'job description'. His alignment with reality is less critical, almost sensual. He speaks feelingly of 'the impulse to put your loving face to it and press your hands against it'. </p> <p>Ravelstein sets himself to argue Chick out of his lifelong tendency to value impressions, particularly childhood epiphanies, over opinions, however steely. The to-and-fro between them, the muffled dialectic of their friendship, gives the book its whisper of drama. By asking to be commemorated, though, in a memoir rather than a peer assessment, Ravelstein significantly retreats from his stated position. </p> <p>Of course, Bellow's artistic personality, his steadfast attachment to details, prevails on the level of the sentence. While Ravelstein is a great consumer of art, in the form largely of Italian music (Rossini, Frescobaldi on original instruments) relayed by plutocratic sound systems, his obsessions are actually politics and religion. It is left to Chick to formulate some sort of theory of art. As we age, time seems to hurry past us: 'Art is one rescue from this chaotic acceleration. Metre in poetry, tempo in music, form and colour in painting. But we do feel that we are speeding earthward, crashing into our graves.' </p> <p>In the late part of the book, Chick suffers a breakdown which has its physical aspect (he has been infected by a fish eaten on holiday) but may also represent the surfacing of a hidden fear - that if he completes the memoir, his own life will be at an end. Bellow takes the risk of describing Chick's hallucinations in detail ('fictions' which for once 'did not have to be invented'). Even in an altered state, Chick, like his creator, holds on to reality by tenacious reflex and, despite their status as illusions, figures like his ex-wife don't lose their waspish pertinence ('You never fall back on religion except to win an argument,' she says). </p> <p>The images of cannibalism which Chick can't get out of his head may be connected to Ravelstein. Mourning a friend can be an act of acquisition, an incorporation of the other's essence as much as an acknowledgement of loss. The great service Ravelstein rendered his disciples, and also Chick, was to turn their faces 'again towards the original' in a world of secondhand responses, forcing them to reopen what they had closed. The great last gift that Allan Bloom gave to Saul Bellow was to allow him to resign, in this supremely vigorous meditation, from the most sapping role that a novelist can find himself playing, the role of sage.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Snow Falling on Cedars David Guterson Read by Tim Pigott-Smith Running time 3 hrs Harper Collins \u00a38.99 Buy it at BOL It is 1954. A local fisherman is found drowned, his skull crushed by a blow to the head, his fishing boat bobbing up and down, deserted on the morning waves. A Japanese-American, Kabuo Miyamoto, is arrested and charged with his murder. Throughout the trial he remains 'proudly upright with a rigid grace'. Meanwhile, the petty insecurities and deep-seated bigotries of the white community of San Piedro island on the north-west coast of America seep out of the 'grey hue and bleak simplicity' of the courtroom - a scaled-down version of the small and isolated town of Amity Harbour. Hatred hangs as thick as the snow resting on the cedar trees. As the story unfolds, we learn of an adolescent love affair between a white boy, later to become the local journalist reporting on the trial, and a Japanese girl, later to become the wife of the accused man. We also learn of the treatment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War, of their forced detention and the distrust and suspicion felt towards them by white Americans. At times I strained, like the jurors at the trial, 'to make sense of matters'. But Tim Pigott-Smith knows exactly what he is doing. He seems not at all daunted by the wealth of voices and accents he is required to maintain throughout the reading - American and Japanese, male and female, plus some Nordic thrown in for good luck. Pigott-Smith savours every inflection.",

It tends to be undervalued, partly because it's not a tragedy and partly because it is regarded as endorsing Henry's ruthless foreign adventure in France. It is history, and dubious history at that. </p> <p>It doesn't tangle with the eternal problems. It is not about love, or parricide, or old age. It is just about politics and the secular, grubby ambitions of kings. Its empire-worshipping was just about tolerable in Olivier's film version, when Britain was under threat of the Nazis. Then, its military triumphalism could be invoked in the national project of self-defence. But at any later date, and certainly nowadays, it is hard to swallow. </p> <p>And so the title of this book, and the question that it poses, is only surprising to the extent that it asks about something that for a long time has been taken to be self-evident. Of course Henry was a war criminal. And the only real question has seemed to be: does Shakespeare know it? That is, is he covertly against Henry? </p> <p>Henry is a man who surprises everyone. Frivolous as a prince, he suddenly becomes very serious once crowned. He takes being king very seriously, and to prove it, he behaves with great brutality to his friend Falstaff. It is a demonstration of that refusal to entertain ordinary human weaknesses that the twentieth century has learnt to expect of its dictators. </p> <p>From the outset, then, we see that Henry thinks that being in charge means being cruel. He's the kind of person - the commercial world is full of them - who believes that if you want to be a boss you have to be a ruthless bastard. As with Falstaff, so with the French. The war that Henry brings to France is waged by a man who doesn't understand the meaning of friendship. And if he cannot treat a dear friend decently, what chance is there for his nameless enemies? </p> <p>Henry's career as king is marked by a double achievement. He legitimises his family's claim to the throne and he conquers France. All this is of a piece. His father had a dubious claim to the throne. England has a dubious claim to France. Both are made good by a combination of time and force of arms. The legitimacy of the king and the legitimacy of his claim to the French throne are related. Uphold the one and, by implication, the other is endorsed. So the question posed by this book goes to the heart of the play. </p> <p>There are two problems about Henry's expedition to France. First: is he entitled to be there? Second: is he entitled to do what he does when he gets there? If the answer to the first is no, then everything he does in France is also illegal. His very presence is objectionable. But if the answer is yes, then the only charge he has to answer is: was he entitled to order the death of his French prisoners during the climactic battle at Agincourt? Cedric Watts deals with the first question; John Sutherland deals with the second. They do not convict, but nor do they quite acquit. Their judgment is closer to the Scottish verdict of 'not proven'. </p> <p>Shakespeare doesn't like lawyers. The assertion of Henry's right to invade France is made by one of the more dubious of them, the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the Olivier version, he fumbles and bumbles as he gives his tedious exposition of Henry's rights at equally mind-numbing length. </p> <p>But this doesn't discredit his argument; it just discredits him, and makes Henry, by contrast, appear every inch the decisive man of action. Henry expects the archbishop to provide a justification for the expedition and he duly gets it. The thinness of the justification - the Salic law doesn't apply in France - is besides the point. </p> <p>Lawyers are expected to provide justifications for their client's actions, however egregious. The archbishop's job is to give Henry some arguments to support his claim and he does. It is his contribution to the war effort, no different in kind to the banker's contribution of funds. Watts thinks that the play equivocates on the justice of Henry's claims. I don't agree. The play endorses them, while pointing out (in the epilogue) that his successes were short-lived. But then that was England's fault. Not being able to hold on to what you have won doesn't in itself mean that you held it wrongfully. </p> <p>Fighting his way through France, Henry arrives at Agincourt. He wins the battle against absurd odds. It is a fine moment, which the play encourages us to enjoy. He also orders the death of a number of defenceless prisoners. This is not such a fine moment, and it's easy to overlook it (particularly when it is suppressed, as in both the Olivier and Branagh films). </p> <p>The play encourages us to regard it as retaliation for a French attack on the English base camp. It thus has a rough kind of justice - instant revenge, in the context of a battle. But the play also gives us some evidence for regarding it as unprovoked murder, because the first time Henry gives his order is before he knows of the French attack. </p> <p>It's just the kind of puzzle that John Sutherland likes and he nibbles away at it (as he does at other problems in Shakespeare). For those unsatisfied with his conclusions, I recommend the work of the American scholar Theodor Meron.

How much of the 'linguistic detail' do you pick up? Are some speeches ('To be or not to be', 'Our revels now are ended') too familiar for us really to hear, 'too well known to be well known'? In the forward rush of action, do you understand every word or are you just hanging on to the general sense, 'like watching an opera in Czech'? And, if Shakespeare's language is often hard to follow now, how much more so was it for his audience? </p> <p>Frank Kermode's book on Shakespeare's 'dramatic verse' is partly about how Shakespeare is, and has been, heard, and it suggests interesting questions about the difference between reading and listening, and about audiences. Kermode proposes that Shakespeare's audiences, used to listening to long, complex oratory (like sermons) grew up with Shakespeare and were 'trained' by him to listen to a language of increasing obscurity and difficulty. Even if they didn't follow every word, 'they had been taught by Shakespeare' to 'take in' such difficulties 'at a hearing'. </p> <p>But this book isn't mainly about audience; it's about writing and about the changes and developments in Shakespeare's use of poetry in the theatre. This doesn't mean that it's relentlessly purist, only looking at words in a timeless vacuum. Kermode needs to bring in theatre history, textual variants and performers. </p> <p>And he has to discuss the dating of the plays, since his argument is that around 1599-1600 (the period of Julius Caesar, 'The Phoenix and the Turtle', Twelfth Night and Hamlet ) there is a turning point, a revolution in Shakespeare's language from a more artificial, rhetorical, ornamental style into something tougher and more rugged, and also more free, various, difficult and inward. (The two styles can overlap, he acknowledges, within single plays, and the Elizabethan audiences also liked nostalgic revivals of plays in the older manner alongside newer plays.) </p> <p>After a rapid survey of the 1590s plays, Kermode gives a brief, intense chapter to the language of every play from Julius Caesar to The Tempest. This approach he describes, rather haughtily, as 'writing against the current'. A recent account by Catherine Bates in the Times Literary Supplement of new Shakespeare criticism said that 'to ask what it felt like to be Shakespeare, with a head full of words' would now be 'so d\u00e9mod\u00e9 as to be professionally suicidal'. </p> <p>But, at 80, Sir Frank doesn't have to worry about professional suicide. He sets himself against what to him are two equally detestable approaches to Shakespeare - the idolatrous and the deconstructionist. Resisting the approach to Shakespeare as 'somehow sacred' (no names are mentioned, but Harold Bloom seems to loom large), Kermode frequently allows for Shakespeare to collaborate and make mistakes, be dull or excessive. </p> <p>He gives out a lot of B minuses. So Hotspur is 'capable of rant'; Jacques on melancholy is 'tedious'; The Two Gentlemen of Verona has 'tiresomenesses'; The Merchant of Venice has 'some passages we might now wish away'; Measure For Measure is 'a truly great play for about half its length'. But he likes to see Shakespeare struggling with 'excess of energy' or in 'compositional trouble', because it gives the lie to Bardolatry. </p> <p>On the other hand, 'it cannot be wicked or stupid to make occasional allusion to [Shakespeare's] presence'; he exists 'as the corpus of plays we agree to call by his name', and he has value. 'You can't get rid of Shakespeare without abolishing the very notion of literature.' Kermode has no time for Shakespeare as a collection of competing discourses or a product of 'imperialistic brainwashing' and 'unexamined bourgeois valuations'. </p> <p>You won't find discussions here of post-coloniality or cultural history, gender or feminism, identity or hegemony. Instead, Kermode deliberately reinstates the tradition of the dead white male writer-critics who have paid most attention to Shakespeare's words: Johnson, Coleridge, Hazlitt, de Quincey, Auden, Eliot and Empson. </p> <p>Attention to language also means attending to what's not said. Kermode is very good on silence. He shows us how much deeper Shakespeare's silences get by comparing the aghast, elaborate rhetoric which greets the sight of Lavinia with her hands and tongue cut off in Titus with the terrible silence of blind Gloucester, left on stage during the battle in Lear, or the 'competing silences' at the end of A Winter's Tale, when the statue of Hermione is revealed and at last breaks into speech, after long silence. </p> <p>Silence can co-exist with a tremendous amount of noise, too, like Virgilia, Coriolanus's 'gracious silence', in the thick of military din. Shakespeare's astounding variety of language is made much of, from Romeo and Juliet's wild, wide range of rhetorical levels to Hamlet's 'bazaar' of transformations and variations. And his odd juxtapositions are well noted: Desdemona's sudden, strange remark about Lodovico ('a proper man') just after her cruel humiliation by Othello, or the effect of putting clowns' malapropisms next to great griefs: 'They bring serpents or pigeons on demand, or make plebeian jokes over an open grave, demonstrating totally unheroic attitudes to the posturing of the mighty'. </p> <p>But under or alongside variety and disjunctions, Kermode recognises an increasingly obsessive reiteration of words, an 'intense brooding over words'. This, quoting Virginia Woolf, he calls the 'little language' of the plays: the use of 'a particular word or set of words to give undercurrents of sense to the dramatic narrative'. In Othello, the word is 'lie'; in Troilus and Cressida, it's 'opinion'; in Anthony and Cleopatra, it's 'becoming'; in Lear, it's 'addition'; in the porter scene in Macbeth, it's 'equivocation'. </p> <p>And Macbeth is all about equivocation: false promises and false choices, uncertainty about time and the future, the struggle between action and consequences, the price of success. For Kermode, that idea of equivocation in language reaches out beyond Macbeth: 'All may be said to equivocate, and on their equivocal variety we impose our limited interpretations.' </p> <p>It's on the (often equivocal) relationship between thought and action that Shakespeare brings his most obscure and oblique language to bear. This writing about thinking is often very difficult. Shakespeare 'is an author whose business it was to present character in all its inaccessibility, in language at least as opaque as necessary'. </p> <p>Kermode is at his very best when deeply involved in Shakespeare's presentation of characters locked in their processes of thought, like Aufidius (in the long speech on his dangerous ally, Coriolanus, beginning: 'All places yield to him ere he sits down'), 'trying to make clearer to himself just how mixed his feelings are, how difficult he finds it to take a determined position'.

      "bodyText": "Shakespeare's Language Frank Kermode Penguin \u00a320, pp336 Buy it at BOL What do you hear when you go to a Shakespeare play? How much of the 'linguistic detail' do you pick up? Are some speeches ('To be or not to be', 'Our revels now are ended') too familiar for us really to hear, 'too well known to be well known'? In the forward rush of action, do you understand every word or are you just hanging on to the general sense, 'like watching an opera in Czech'? And, if Shakespeare's language is often hard to follow now, how much more so was it for his audience? Frank Kermode's book on Shakespeare's 'dramatic verse' is partly about how Shakespeare is, and has been, heard, and it suggests interesting questions about the difference between reading and listening, and about audiences. Kermode proposes that Shakespeare's audiences, used to listening to long, complex oratory (like sermons) grew up with Shakespeare and were 'trained' by him to listen to a language of increasing obscurity and difficulty. Even if they didn't follow every word, 'they had been taught by Shakespeare' to 'take in' such difficulties 'at a hearing'. But this book isn't mainly about audience; it's about writing and about the changes and developments in Shakespeare's use of poetry in the theatre. This doesn't mean that it's relentlessly purist, only looking at words in a timeless vacuum. Kermode needs to bring in theatre history, textual variants and performers. And he has to discuss the dating of the plays, since his argument is that around 1599-1600 (the period of Julius Caesar, 'The Phoenix and the Turtle', Twelfth Night and Hamlet ) there is a turning point, a revolution in Shakespeare's language from a more artificial, rhetorical, ornamental style into something tougher and more rugged, and also more free, various, difficult and inward. (The two styles can overlap, he acknowledges, within single plays, and the Elizabethan audiences also liked nostalgic revivals of plays in the older manner alongside newer plays.) After a rapid survey of the 1590s plays, Kermode gives a brief, intense chapter to the language of every play from Julius Caesar to The Tempest. This approach he describes, rather haughtily, as 'writing against the current'. A recent account by Catherine Bates in the Times Literary Supplement of new Shakespeare criticism said that 'to ask what it felt like to be Shakespeare, with a head full of words' would now be 'so d\u00e9mod\u00e9 as to be professionally suicidal'. But, at 80, Sir Frank doesn't have to worry about professional suicide. He sets himself against what to him are two equally detestable approaches to Shakespeare - the idolatrous and the deconstructionist. Resisting the approach to Shakespeare as 'somehow sacred' (no names are mentioned, but Harold Bloom seems to loom large), Kermode frequently allows for Shakespeare to collaborate and make mistakes, be dull or excessive. He gives out a lot of B minuses. So Hotspur is 'capable of rant'; Jacques on melancholy is 'tedious'; The Two Gentlemen of Verona has 'tiresomenesses'; The Merchant of Venice has 'some passages we might now wish away'; Measure For Measure is 'a truly great play for about half its length'. But he likes to see Shakespeare struggling with 'excess of energy' or in 'compositional trouble', because it gives the lie to Bardolatry. On the other hand, 'it cannot be wicked or stupid to make occasional allusion to [Shakespeare's] presence'; he exists 'as the corpus of plays we agree to call by his name', and he has value. 'You can't get rid of Shakespeare without abolishing the very notion of literature.' Kermode has no time for Shakespeare as a collection of competing discourses or a product of 'imperialistic brainwashing' and 'unexamined bourgeois valuations'. You won't find discussions here of post-coloniality or cultural history, gender or feminism, identity or hegemony. Instead, Kermode deliberately reinstates the tradition of the dead white male writer-critics who have paid most attention to Shakespeare's words: Johnson, Coleridge, Hazlitt, de Quincey, Auden, Eliot and Empson. Attention to language also means attending to what's not said. Kermode is very good on silence. He shows us how much deeper Shakespeare's silences get by comparing the aghast, elaborate rhetoric which greets the sight of Lavinia with her hands and tongue cut off in Titus with the terrible silence of blind Gloucester, left on stage during the battle in Lear, or the 'competing silences' at the end of A Winter's Tale, when the statue of Hermione is revealed and at last breaks into speech, after long silence. Silence can co-exist with a tremendous amount of noise, too, like Virgilia, Coriolanus's 'gracious silence', in the thick of military din. Shakespeare's astounding variety of language is made much of, from Romeo and Juliet's wild, wide range of rhetorical levels to Hamlet's 'bazaar' of transformations and variations. And his odd juxtapositions are well noted: Desdemona's sudden, strange remark about Lodovico ('a proper man') just after her cruel humiliation by Othello, or the effect of putting clowns' malapropisms next to great griefs: 'They bring serpents or pigeons on demand, or make plebeian jokes over an open grave, demonstrating totally unheroic attitudes to the posturing of the mighty'. But under or alongside variety and disjunctions, Kermode recognises an increasingly obsessive reiteration of words, an 'intense brooding over words'. This, quoting Virginia Woolf, he calls the 'little language' of the plays: the use of 'a particular word or set of words to give undercurrents of sense to the dramatic narrative'. In Othello, the word is 'lie'; in Troilus and Cressida, it's 'opinion'; in Anthony and Cleopatra, it's 'becoming'; in Lear, it's 'addition'; in the porter scene in Macbeth, it's 'equivocation'. And Macbeth is all about equivocation: false promises and false choices, uncertainty about time and the future, the struggle between action and consequences, the price of success. For Kermode, that idea of equivocation in language reaches out beyond Macbeth: 'All may be said to equivocate, and on their equivocal variety we impose our limited interpretations.' It's on the (often equivocal) relationship between thought and action that Shakespeare brings his most obscure and oblique language to bear. This writing about thinking is often very difficult. Shakespeare 'is an author whose business it was to present character in all its inaccessibility, in language at least as opaque as necessary'. Kermode is at his very best when deeply involved in Shakespeare's presentation of characters locked in their processes of thought, like Aufidius (in the long speech on his dangerous ally, Coriolanus, beginning: 'All places yield to him ere he sits down'), 'trying to make clearer to himself just how mixed his feelings are, how difficult he finds it to take a determined position'. Contradiction, confusion, obscurity and, above all, inwardness are what energise Shakespeare's greatest language. 'Greatness' and 'genius' are permissible concepts in this book. Those who reject such terms are going to find it autocratic and old-fashioned. And there is something at times irritating about its handing out of grades, its occasional withdrawals into wonderment ('easier to applaud... than to explain'; 'qualities that are in the end beyond description') and its frequent unarguable references to 'a famous speech', 'a tremendous passage', 'a celebrated response', 'the most venerated lines in the play' or 'one of the most miraculous moments'. But at a time when what's been called Big-Time Shakespeare is being energetically re-popularised for a new generation through movies which package him as action, romance, song and dance and showbiz, when Bardolatry sentimentalises him and some academic criticism turns him into a cultural construct, this concentrated, lucid, attentive book comes as a valuable reminder that, as the director Richard Eyre says here: 'The life of the plays is in the language.'",

He secretly photographed the people around him; his fellow Jews, distant ranks of Nazi soldiers, faces that are scared, eager, innocent, knowing, alive. He hid the negatives in tin cans and packed them into a wooden crate which he hid during the liquidisation of the ghetto in 1944. </p> <p>The men, women and children that he had recorded were sent to Auschwitz. That woman, wearing her yellow star, who is scrubbing the streets and unaware that a camera is recording her solitary figure; that boy in a peaked cap, with a thin, solemn face and wide eyes, that mother talking through a wire fence to her son, trying to smile, that joyful group of women in short sleeves, squinting into the sunlight and laughing, that young man with a sweet, clever expression who is Grossman himself: they all went into the dark. We see them now, from beyond their grave. They look back at us, lost. </p> <p>Grossman himself died in 1945 on a forced march. His sister later rescued the negatives, but most were destroyed when the kibbutz where they were housed was ravaged during the War of Independence in 1948.

Beautiful images, in spite of the terror of their subject matter: grainy black and white and soaked in a soft, strong light. </p> <p>'Grossman's photographs make us look with exquisite pity and affection, as into the eyes of people we love,' writes Howard Jacobson in his introduction. The final image - of a young woman staring through a camp fence, her fingers clutching the wires, her eyes gazing out at us dolorously, her figure slightly blurred, as if she is already half gone from us - is almost unbearable. </p> <p>All of the images are almost unbearable. Yet this is a book meant for young people. The simple, first-person text by Frank Dabba Smith asks children to imagine what it was like. Asks all of us to imagine again. It would seem to be the job of all parents and all teachers to make sure that children grow up knowing about the Holocaust. </p> <p>This book, suffused with tenderness, is a good place to start.

      "body": "<p>Grown-ups have self-help books, children don't. Or do they? Writers offer children their services; they second guess children's sorrows and, sometimes covertly, prescribe cheerful solutions. A new baby in the family, a new school, making (or failing to make) new friends... there is a literature devoted to these problems. But it is only recently that I have noticed the growing number of picture books that focus on broken homes and extended families. </p> <p><strong> The Visitors Who Came to Stay </strong> by Annalena McAfee, illustrated by Anthony Browne (Walker \u00a39.99) is one of the best examples of its kind. Its emotional temperature is perfectly judged. Katy lives alone with her dad and has mixed feelings when Mary and Sean show up. Mary is not wicked stepmother material; she is complicated and convincing. She wears a wide smile and a short skirt. Her son, Sean, is an irritant, a walking joke shop. Gradually, Katy learns that sometimes it is possible to be friends with the people you expected to be enemies for the rest of your life. Anthony Browne's bold, loud, clearer-than-life illustrations cannot be ignored, any more than the potential step-relatives can (five+). </p> <p><strong> Rainy Day</strong> by Emma Haughton, illustrated by Angelo Rinaldi (Doubleday \u00a39.99) is a more sentimental approach to a broken family but none the worse for that. Rinaldi's moody, grey-skied, rain-splashed illustrations seem somewhere between paintings and photographs. Ned is visiting his dad. There is nothing obvious for them to do. They walk to the sea, get tired, get soaked, eat broken biscuits and when Dad says that rainy days don't last forever, you know he is comforting himself as well as Ned. I read on with a lump in my throat (four+) </p> <p>Dads are getting a great press elsewhere this spring. Anthony Browne shows up again with a book that is all his own work. <strong> My Dad</strong> (Doubleday \u00a39.99) is a surreal tribute to a father who, although he is seen by his son as a paragon, is never seen out of his tweedy dressing-gown. He sees off a wolf, jumps over the Moon, wins the father's race and swims like a fish (picture of fish/Dad with tweedy belly tied with dressing gown cord). Perhaps he is just too busy to get dressed. The book is simple and splendidly entertaining: Daddy worship at its best (three+). </p> <p>You can judge <strong> Clever Cat</strong> by Peter Collington (Cape \u00a39.99) - and this cat - by its cover. Look at the marvellously neat orange fellow standing on two legs with a bunch of keys depending from his wrist and two blue tins of cat food between his paws. The cat does not seem to need his owners - at first. The moral of this witty book is obscure but I believe it is about the advantages of underachievement, of lazing on a sun-drenched step when you get half the chance (for older children and indolent adults). </p> <p>Dogs can be clever, too. <strong> Dog's Night </strong> by Meredith Hooper and Allan Curless (Frances Lincoln \u00a310.99) is about the dogs in the paintings in London's National Gallery, who get together for a pow-wow on one night, every year. The hairy brown dog who looks like a burr in Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Marriage breaks free of his frame along with the hunting dog from Gainsborough's portrait of Mr and Mrs Andrews. Then the dogs climb back into the wrong paintings. My audience was curious and delighted. So was I (four+). </p> <p>Helen Ward's <strong> The Hare and the Tortoise</strong> (Templar \u00a39.99) is a beautiful book. I often find retellings of old stories a downer; why not find a new story to tell? But this is a ravishing exception to the rule. Chardin would not be ashamed of the hare that leaps across these pages, leaving a decorative tangle of animals in his path. The tortoise is handsome, too, worthy of this spirited new version of his story (three+). </p> <p><strong> The Hidden Forest </strong> by Jeannie Baker (Walker \u00a39.99) is a knock-out. It is a marvellous companion piece to Baker's haunting book, Where the Forest Meets the Sea. She is passionately devoted to preserving endangered environments. Here, she concentrates on Tasmania's Tasman Peninsula and its kelp forests. Her artwork is constructed 'using a multitude of collected natural materials including seaweeds, sponges and sands'. The result is pure poetry: a billowing saffron and jade underwater forest, a hitherto undiscovered country (four+). </p> <p><strong> The Elf's Hat</strong> by Brigitte Weninger and John A. Rowe (North-South Books \u00a39.99) is an immediately striking book. North-South Books specialises in painterly work and this is no exception. Rowe's idea of an elfin hat is anything but twee; it is more like some colossal, red chilli pepper. The elf loses his hat and then a bizarre assortment of animals move into the hat like squatters but none, as we shall discover, is more tenacious than the flea. The story is constructed in a powerful way. It grows like a good, long joke (three+). </p> <p>In<strong> Ruby the Ballet Star: a Twirly Whirly Pop-up Book </strong> by Harriet Griffey, illustrated by Anne Holt (Tango Books \u00a38.99), Ruby is a fat guinea pig, an unlikely ballerina and this season's star pop-up character. Watch her at the barre, her tongue out in concentration next to elegant vermin in pink ballet shoes. She is, surely, never going to make it. But she practises and practises and when the shocking pink curtains part, Ruby is transformed. The last pages of this uninhibitedly enjoyable success story feature her twirly-whirling centre stage. (two+) </p> <p><strong> Picture This</strong> by Alison Jay (Templar \u00a39.99) is a lovely book, subtitled 'A child's first picture book'. Each page introduces an object. Each object looks as if it has been painted on old china, which lends it romance. It has an archetypal feel. 'Dog' is a slightly misshapen chap with a tiny head and cowlike body but he jumps zestfully above the heads of a skipping boy and girl. I can think of no more joyous first encounter with 'kite' than this one, a burnt orange shape above the sea making its way towards a distant lighthouse (one+). </p> <p>There are many nostalgic reprints in children's publishing but <strong> Eloise</strong> (Simon and Schuster \u00a312.99) by Kay Thompson, who made her name in the Fifties, is new to me. The book is subtitled: 'For precocious grown-ups' and is pink, black and white, as if drawn in ink and lipstick. Eloise leads a dysfunctional life. She kills time in the Plaza Hotel in New York, has her hair done, does headstands and calls on room service ('Ooooooooo I absolutely love Room Service'). I hated her - and yet could not resist her. Catch her in the elevator and see which way you go. (Girls only; eight+). </p> <p>And, finally, for parents who want to scoop up some of first-rate, reprinted children's picture books in slim paperback form at \u00a32.99 each, it is worth looking out for the delectable <strong> Kid-Sized Puffins</strong>. These include <strong> Meg's Car</strong> by Helen Nicoll &amp; Jan Pienkowski about a witch who really ought to think about joining the AA or give up driving; <strong> Dinosaur Roar!</strong> by Paul &amp; Henrietta Strickland, a must for dino-fanciers; <strong> Funnybones</strong> by Janet &amp; Allan Ahlberg, an endearing and most unscary haunting by frisky skeletons and - my absolute favourite - <strong> The Elephant and the Bad Baby </strong> by Elfrida Vipont, illustrated by Raymond Briggs . </p> <p>The story may not reform bad babies, but it will definitely keep them and their parents happily out of trouble for as long as the story lasts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502411578,00.html\">Buy The Visitors Who Came to Stay at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502362992,00.html\">Buy Rainy Day at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502413420,00.html\">Buy My Dad at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502369442,00.html\">Buy Clever Cat at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502127477,00.html\">Buy The Hare and the Tortoise at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502411496,00.html\">Buy The Hidden Forest at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502413845,00.html\">Buy The Elf's Hat at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502416909,00.html\">Buy Ruby the Ballet Star at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502369447,00.html\">Buy Eloise at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502331900,00.html\">Buy Meg's Car at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501493623,00.html\">Buy Dinosuar Roar! at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501839002,00.html\">Buy Funnybones at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502331895,00.html\">Buy The Elephant and the Bad Baby at BOL</a></p>",

She kills time in the Plaza Hotel in New York, has her hair done, does headstands and calls on room service ('Ooooooooo I absolutely love Room Service'). I hated her - and yet could not resist her. Catch her in the elevator and see which way you go. (Girls only; eight+). And, finally, for parents who want to scoop up some of first-rate, reprinted children's picture books in slim paperback form at \u00a32.99 each, it is worth looking out for the delectable Kid-Sized Puffins. These include Meg's Car by Helen Nicoll &amp; Jan Pienkowski about a witch who really ought to think about joining the AA or give up driving; Dinosaur Roar! by Paul &amp; Henrietta Strickland, a must for dino-fanciers; Funnybones by Janet &amp; Allan Ahlberg, an endearing and most unscary haunting by frisky skeletons and - my absolute favourite - The Elephant and the Bad Baby by Elfrida Vipont, illustrated by Raymond Briggs . The story may not reform bad babies, but it will definitely keep them and their parents happily out of trouble for as long as the story lasts.

If there is one theme that unites these two compelling books, by two wildly different characters, it is the surreal and separate world of battle. Milos Stankovic was a British soldier from old royalist Yugoslav stock who left Tito's communism. He grew up in Zimbabwe, joined the Parachute Regiment, did heroic service in Bosnia and ended up being arrested for spying for the Serbs. His arrest and long agony spent swinging in the wind was an appalling betrayal by the British Army of a good soldier dreadfully wronged. Max Hastings is a warrior manqu\u00e9. </p> <p>Stankovic was the victim of a double jeopardy. His Serb language made him as gold dust to the British Army. He worked as an interpreter and, more importantly, as a fixer to Generals Sir Mike Rose and then Sir Rupert Smith. Anticipating trouble, the British Army gave him a cover name and called him 'Mike Stanley'. Two other Brit-Serb soldiers were called 'Abbott' and 'Costello'. 'Stanley' came from Stan Laurel. Very droll, very British Army. But once the Bosnian Muslims had worked out his origins, Stankovic-Stanley was under a perpetual cloud of suspicion. One of their newspapers called him a 'trusted mole' of the Bosnian Serb authorities. </p> <p>The charge is grotesquely untrue once you read his vivid description of the twilight zone of the Bosnian Serb leadership in Pale. The butcher of Sarajevo, General Ratko Mladic, comes across as a fascinating monster, a force of nature with bewitching eyes. Mladic tricked US three-star General Wesley Clark into swapping hats and the moment was forever caught by Serb TV. (Mladic was later to play exactly the same trick with the poor, doomed commander of the Dutch battalion in Srebrenica. After the Dutch allowed the Serbs to overrun the enclave, condemning 5,000 Muslims to their deaths, Mladic arranged a toast of champagne. As the Dutch commander raised his glass, in walked Serb TV.) </p> <p>Stankovic's book is far more than the outcry of an innocent man foully accused. He has a wonderful eye for detail and a natural storyteller's gift, and passion, to get across the bizarre and terrible cruelty of what the people of Bosnia went through. At times, I laughed out loud; at times, horrible moments of my spells there came swimming back, brilliantly evoked in Stankovic's fresh prose.</p> <p>Here is his description of crash first-aid to a sniper victim : 'She's gone a grey-white and is no longer moaning. There's a medic outside the vehicle with a stretcher so I give him the drip-set as he's the expert. But he mucks it up and tries to stick the canula into a vein in her hand, \u00e0 la classroom. But there's no vein because it's collapsed, as veins do in the extremities when someone's in shock. Anyway, this needle goes in and produces nothing more than a bloody great bubble of saline solution under her skin. There's nothing going into her system. Then the medic faints.' </p> <p>This description had me roaring my head off in a Tube train. She lived. Trusted Mole is rich in comic scenes, the best of which is the arrival of two baby incubators, one to the Serbs, one to the Muslims. The first didn't work; the second was used to grow marijuana. And then there's finding fly-fishing spots for the general in the middle of a war. </p> <p>But the comedy switchbacks with the tragedy. The muddle of the UN's failed peacekeeping mission is nailed to the wall in a way - strangely, because Stankovic worked incredibly hard for General Rose to deliver a kind of peace. But the forces of hatred were stronger, and 'peacekeeping' collapsed in favour of peacemaking, which meant bombing the Serbs. This man was a hero, caught in the middle and discarded by a military bureaucracy that should be shot at dawn for its betrayal. No doubt a film is in the offing. </p> <p>Hastings's book has its own surprises. As a rookie reporter in Northern Ireland in 1969, he saw the RUC act with grotesque violence, machine-gunning Catholic homes: 'Anyone who was there that August night in Belfast... understood how the revival of the IRA became possible, and why the Royal Ulster Constabulary forfeited for ever the trust of Catholic Ireland.' Perhaps Hastings's successor as editor of the Daily Telegraph should take note. </p> <p>In Vietnam, we read that his own personal store of courage had run out. Having determined to stay on in Saigon, he swayed at the last moment and rushed to the American embassy to hitch a ride on one of the last choppers out. He went on to cover yet more wars - a Fleet Street hack who ended up beating the British Army to Port Stanley and liberating the Upland Goose.</p>",

Rescue and drama has now become the idiom in which his psychological life is being honed. While there will shortly be a resolution of where Eli\u00e1n is to end up, his problems have just begun. And it is this that the psychologists and psychiatrists will be aware of. They know that there is no easy psychological return to his father, to his life before, to the attachments in Cuba before he and his mother left. Nor is there an easy psychological solution in letting him stay in the States. Eli\u00e1n's recent life has been marked by loss, by death and by exploitation - and the psychologists will be hoping to find a way to help him acknowledge the perverse ways in which his personal loss and terrors have been taken advantage of.",

But the President, who was forced to return a statue smuggled out of Mali that he was given as a present last year, promised to make the restitution of plundered works a priority. And he said those countries that had lost valuable pieces would now be proud that their cultures were recognised as worthy of the Louvre. France also believes it has covered itself, in the case of the Nok statues, by signing an agreement with the Nigerian government under which - in exchange for keeping the works - it will train Nigerian curators in restoration and museum management. But those arguments failed to impress Brinkman. He pointed out that several Nigerian curators had complained bitterly about the deal. 'Any country that wants to display the works of another culture must be absolutely sure of their origin,' he said. Brinkman criticised the notion that it was better to have the works of ancient civilisations on display in western Europe than hidden away in native museums or in the hands of collectors. 'It's a very, very dangerous view,' he said. 'It's a licence to start buying smuggled artwork. Museums must be completely irreproachable - if they start buying dubious pieces, it will only encourage further pillaging. The message must be quite clear: never buy or accept a stolen piece. And if you find one, return it.'",

There's a 24-hour burger joint nearby but Juan, a driver for the Premium livery car company, is in no mood to stop. It was here that he dropped a passenger who pulled a gun when he couldn't change a $100 bill. 'He was pointing it right at my face,' Juan recalls. 'I said don't pay me nothing. Just go on.' Juan is a lucky man. Already this year seven livery car drivers in Manhattan have been killed. Last week another was attacked with a machete. In response New York's mayor Rudy Giuliani has deployed every officer serving in his controversial Street Crimes Unit to a single assignment with a single order: to stop the massacre. And this time the squad has the support of the very minorities who have con demned its readiness to open fire on unarmed suspects. Livery cars - leather-lined Lincoln Town saloons - compete against New York's Yellow Cabs, usually at a lower price. They operate from radio dispatch offices and are not licensed.

Last week the tight-knit Hispanic community of Washington Heights sent Luis Francesco Perez home to his native Dominican Republic in a white coffin - the sixth livery cab driver to be murdered this year. The following day Haitian Jean Robert Scutt became a seventh victim, shot dead by a passenger in Brooklyn. Perez would have been 30 last Monday.

Divided denizens of Battery Park City, a leafy riverside haven of white affluence worlds away from the hustle of nearby Wall Street, agree only on one thing: their pristine pavements have gone to the dogs. More than a thousand pampered pooches now populate the small area opposite the Statue of Liberty along the Hudson, all leading politely leashed, well-groomed, scooped and neutered lives - banned from parks but sleeping on Gucci dog beds in luxury condos and being walked by $60-an-hour dog-walkers. Dogs are big business in Battery Park City, supporting 10 full-time dog walkers, two doggie daycare centres, a vet, several pet stores and even a 'pet spa'. But the inevitable 'dog business' has proved too much for one litigious resident who has caused a furore over where dogs can walk, pee, poop or play. Gabe Sumner, described by neighbours as barking and abusive, often accosts and harangues dog-owners, his video camera catching any hapless pooch relieving itself on the street. 'Get a life!' they barked. Instead, Sumner did what comes naturally to many rich, bored New Yorkers: he took legal action, trying to keep dog urination areas at least 18 inches into the street. His case, rejected in February since local laws cannot supersede New York City laws, leaked the 'urine' war on to the pages of the local TriBeCa Tribune and Battery Park City Broadsheet, where it raged on. Some wags at the dog club said the BPC Authority had a secret deal with Sumner to ban dogs from the Esplanade, a tree-lined path along the Hudson which teems with tourists, cyclists, joggers and roller-bladers. Walking his two German shepherds, Persephone and Psyche, there early one morning, Jeff Galloway, a Manhattan attorney, was first to learn it was true: 'A park officer stopped me and said all dogs are going to be banned from the Esplanade effective 1 May. There had been no consultation, no announcement, nothing. I told people, they told people, and I guess everybody just got fed up.' A meeting last month attracted hundreds of wealthy dog-lovers; in a week a website was set up, letters were hitting the desks of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, US Congressmen and politicians. The newly-formed Battery Park City Dog Association packed a Manhattan Community Board meeting and their howls of protest forced a retreat. Now Persephone, Psyche and pals are free to prance - and pee - along the Esplanade, Sumner's video camera be damned. 'Listening to Sumner, you'd think we were all living in a dog bathroom,' says Galloway. 'But it's so pristine compared to the rest of New York.

Last-minute offers available in April and May to popular destinations are cheap enough for a family of four to save more than \u00a31,000 by travelling to Florida via Dublin on a two-week break.</p> <p>The savings are even more astonishing because some of the holidays are offered by subsidiaries of the same British company, Thomson.</p> <p>In one case, a fortnight at a three-star hotel in Orlando, Florida, with Dublin-based Budget Travel costs \u00a3786.61 for a family of four. The same family buying this holiday from Budget's parent company, Thomson, would pay \u00a32,138 from Gatwick. Adding four air fares from Gatwick to Dublin with Ryanair, at a cost of \u00a3265.61, would still leave a saving of \u00a31,085.79.</p> <p>'The whole industry has blossomed in the past three or four years,' said Niamh Hayes, marketing director of Budget Travel. 'We have had a real increase of people trav elling from the North to travel from Dublin. It used to be that Irish families went on holiday via the UK because it was cheaper and there was more choice.'</p> <p>Irish travellers make further savings because they no longer pay airport taxes since the government abolished them a year ago.</p> <p>As more than 1.5 million tourists left Britain this weekend on last-minute breaks, there was evidence that holidaymakers were also paying more than they would in Germany and France for almost identical breaks and flights. Tourists with access to the Internet or ready to make a phone call to Ireland or Germany can save hundreds of pounds.</p> <p>A package holiday in Kenya flying from Gatwick is advertised on the Internet by Thomas Cook's German subsidiary, TUI, for 46 per cent less than a trip sold on the bargain-basement website, <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">lastminute.com</a>, to the same four-star hotel. A holiday to the Dominican Republic, flying from Frankfurt, would be cheaper than a similar holiday from the UK, even after including the return airfare from Stansted to Frankfurt.</p> <p>The pound's strength partly explains the price differences, but Ireland's booming economy has fuelled rapid growth in its own travel industry.</p> <p>The Association of British Travel Agents admitted prices were higher in British brochures than at German travel agents, but was surprised by the savings avail able in Ireland. Yet Abta's head of corporate affairs, Keith Betton, defended the tour operators: 'There is no discounting in Germany. If you take a brochure from Britain, the prices are never what you pay. The operators don't want to do it, but customers say, \"I don't want one at that price; I want one cheaper\".'</p> <p>Some companies make it virtually impossible for British residents to get the best bargains. British Airways will sell a French resident a ticket to Delhi from Paris via London for \u00a3454.28, including taxes. A British resident boarding the same flight at Heathrow pays \u00a3534.60.

      "bodyText": "British tourists can save half the cost of their package holiday if they buy it directly from an Irish travel agent. Last-minute offers available in April and May to popular destinations are cheap enough for a family of four to save more than \u00a31,000 by travelling to Florida via Dublin on a two-week break. The savings are even more astonishing because some of the holidays are offered by subsidiaries of the same British company, Thomson. In one case, a fortnight at a three-star hotel in Orlando, Florida, with Dublin-based Budget Travel costs \u00a3786.61 for a family of four. The same family buying this holiday from Budget's parent company, Thomson, would pay \u00a32,138 from Gatwick. Adding four air fares from Gatwick to Dublin with Ryanair, at a cost of \u00a3265.61, would still leave a saving of \u00a31,085.79. 'The whole industry has blossomed in the past three or four years,' said Niamh Hayes, marketing director of Budget Travel. 'We have had a real increase of people trav elling from the North to travel from Dublin. It used to be that Irish families went on holiday via the UK because it was cheaper and there was more choice.' Irish travellers make further savings because they no longer pay airport taxes since the government abolished them a year ago. As more than 1.5 million tourists left Britain this weekend on last-minute breaks, there was evidence that holidaymakers were also paying more than they would in Germany and France for almost identical breaks and flights. Tourists with access to the Internet or ready to make a phone call to Ireland or Germany can save hundreds of pounds. A package holiday in Kenya flying from Gatwick is advertised on the Internet by Thomas Cook's German subsidiary, TUI, for 46 per cent less than a trip sold on the bargain-basement website, lastminute.com, to the same four-star hotel. A holiday to the Dominican Republic, flying from Frankfurt, would be cheaper than a similar holiday from the UK, even after including the return airfare from Stansted to Frankfurt. The pound's strength partly explains the price differences, but Ireland's booming economy has fuelled rapid growth in its own travel industry. The Association of British Travel Agents admitted prices were higher in British brochures than at German travel agents, but was surprised by the savings avail able in Ireland. Yet Abta's head of corporate affairs, Keith Betton, defended the tour operators: 'There is no discounting in Germany. If you take a brochure from Britain, the prices are never what you pay. The operators don't want to do it, but customers say, \"I don't want one at that price; I want one cheaper\".' Some companies make it virtually impossible for British residents to get the best bargains. British Airways will sell a French resident a ticket to Delhi from Paris via London for \u00a3454.28, including taxes. A British resident boarding the same flight at Heathrow pays \u00a3534.60. The Paris-based travel agent said she would sell the ticket to a British citizen, but it had to be bought in France. Such ploys have infuriated the Consumers' Association. 'It comes down to how much they can get people to pay,' said Roger Lakin, assistant editor of Holiday Which? Which? researchers are currently investigating Continental brochures that advertise identical holidays at lower prices than British consumers are charged. Lakin rejected the industry's justifications: 'They say you have to factor in discounting, which is offensive, because that assumes people are being completely misled about the genuine price of a holiday. Can the brochure price be a genuine price if an agent can offer a discount of more than 30 per cent and still make money?' He said that only a court case would test terms and conditions that prevent passengers from getting the best price.

Indian leaders were planning a march. They could be joined by some 2,000 members of the Landless Rural Workers Movement. About 2,000 peasant families have been occupying a makeshift camp on a roadside 40 miles to the west.</p> <p>Indian leader Hugo Xavante said: 'What the government says is a lie.

About 330,000 members of indigenous groups survive, down from as many as five million in 1500.

      "bodyText": "Brazil yesterday celebrated the first landing by Portuguese colonisers 500 years ago, amid growing protests by thousands of Indians and landless farm workers. Thousands of police were assigned to the beach resort of Porto Seguro, about 500 miles north-east of Rio de Janeiro, where 13 vessels from the Portuguese fleet arrived on 22 April, 1500. Indians have denounced the celebrations and the authorities have scaled them down. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was meeting his Portuguese counterpart, President Jorge Sampaio, later in the day, warned that 'the celebrations are not an invitation to a burial'. He was referring to fears that protests could bring confrontations with police. Indian leaders were planning a march. They could be joined by some 2,000 members of the Landless Rural Workers Movement. About 2,000 peasant families have been occupying a makeshift camp on a roadside 40 miles to the west. Indian leader Hugo Xavante said: 'What the government says is a lie. Brazil wasn't discovered; our land was invaded.' Xavante is among more than 3,000 Indians from 186 Brazilian tribes or 'nations' who have been conferring at Coroa Vermelho, about 10 miles from Porto Seguro, and organising a counter-demonstration. They have drafted a list of grievances. About 330,000 members of indigenous groups survive, down from as many as five million in 1500. Many died after the invasions from European diseases and others were killed in massacres. They had hoped to present Cardoso with a document demanding speedy settlement of their land claims and better health care and education. Indians claim rights to 739 reservations, but the government has recognised only 231. In many areas white settlers and prospectors live in constant conflict with native residents, and in recent weeks landless campaigners have invaded 500 farms. The Landless Rural Workers Movement is demanding Cardoso speed up agrarian reform in Brazil, where the richest 20 per cent of the people own 90 per cent of the land. The movement was incensed last week by the government's refusal to meet a delegation. The Indians' document also calls for greater respect for traditional Indian medicine and better protection of intellectual property rights, threatened by the incursion of foreign drug companies seeking patents on traditional cures. More optimistic observers said the unprecedented gathering of diverse tribes was a sign that Indians at last may be forging a united front to press for their demands. 'You have to realise there's a warrior history, a lot of these tribes have a historic distrust of each other,' said Saulo Feitosa, vice-president of the Catholic Church-linked Indigenous Missionary Council, which helped organise the conference. Indian sympathisers are also worried about a Bill pending in Congress that would strip Indians of their traditional status as wards of the state and could open up their reservations to mining operations. Police have deployed 5,147 security agents and said they would block the passage of anyone trying to upset the planned events. 'There is a limit to freedom of expression, and no one is free to offend the President,' said the Bah\u00eda state police chief, Colonel Cristovam Pinheiro.",

Two policemen caught me - they beat me up.'</p> <p>Nervous, he starts walking away from the ferry terminal at a brisk pace. Over the next 50 metres, he will periodically turn round to see me following him.</p> <p>'What?'</p> <p>Is it possible to go to the UK?</p> <p>'What?'</p> <p>I want to go to the UK - no passport. Is it possible to go on a truck?</p> <p>Muhammad seems to size up the question for a while; he is still walking away from the ferry terminal. After a minute's pondering, he throws his hands up in exasperation. He doesn't understand the question.</p> <p>'What?'</p> <p>I want to go to the UK - to London.</p> <p>I point to a passing truck, whose driver suspiciously eyes the two Asiatic men standing at the side of the road, pointing at the rear of his vehicle.</p> <p>I want to go in one of those. In the back of it to London. How much? \u00a3100_ \u00a3200_ \u00a3300_?</p> <p>'I understand. Two hundred dollars,' says Muhammad. 'Come to Sangatt, come to the camp. You meet Afghanis, Pakistanis and Iranians. It will cost $200. Difficult, but can be done. My friends help with truck. Some days, too much police. Some days, not many.'</p> <p>What is the camp, and where is Sangatt?</p> <p>Muhammad searches for the right words, but can't find many. He looks at me in frustration, then finally says: 'Camp - for people like me. In Sangatt. Eight kilometres down the road.' He points in the direction we have just walked from.</p> <p>Is it possible to go to London today?</p> <p>Muhammad thinks not - the ferry port this morning has a high police presence, he says. He has already been moved on twice in as many hours for loitering.</p> <p>'Too much police. Very difficult then. Problem. Police. Have to wait. Go to Sangatt, and ask there. People will help.' He ambles on down the carriageway, slowly disappearing into the distance.</p> <p>The camp at Sangatt is a cavernous green shed, only eight miles from Calais. A detention centre for asylum-seekers waiting to be processed by the French authorities, the building houses about 700 applicants. It runs an open-door policy - its curious 'guests' are allowed to wander in and out of the building without restrictions.</p> <p>Many of its residents can be seen walking around Calais itself - thin, huddled figures struggling to come to terms with their surroundings. Later on Tuesday afternoon, at a little past 3pm, Saftar, Ali and Wahid - three detainees from the centre - approach the lorry park adjacent to Calais's passenger terminal.</p> <p>As streams of freight trucks drive past, the three look at the traffic with anticipation. A number of the truck drivers gaze at the trio.</p> <p>Saftar and Ali - both originally from Pakistan - are in negotiations with a truck driver for a safe passage to the UK. Both look in their mid-thirties, plainly dressed in jeans and leather jackets. Both speak fluent Punjabi - and after much discussion, agree to a fee of \u00a3350 for a fourth person, me, to be smuggled on a truck with them into Britain.</p> <p>The transaction is carried out with an almost matter-of-fact simplicity; few questions are asked, and no consequences are discussed. The money, it seems, will encourage the driver to turn a blind eye as we climb on board the truck.</p> <p>These are the solemn, dignified faces of asylum-seekers entering the country. The trio are, at worst, escaping political violence from their homelands. At best, they aspire to the same decent standard of living achieved by generations of immigrants before them.</p> <p>In their wake last week, the Tory Party has lurched further to the extreme right - with all the ugly hallmarks of racial intolerance and bigotry. Political marketing for fresh votes from an old message overlooks their plight.</p> <p>Saftar and Ali both disappear to negotiate the whereabouts of the truck driver. Wahid - Malaysian in origin - sits on the corrugated fence that borders the lorry park. He speaks no English. Every few minutes, he rises to his feet and takes an anxious look down towards the terminal building for any sign of a police presence.</p> <p>Always stern-faced, he allows himself a faint smile only when his companions return.</p> <p>Theirs is a hateful existence - always waiting for an opening; hours are killed with nervous movements.</p> <p>This late at night, the trio daren't walk into town to idle away the few remaining hours. Saftar explains a truck has been organised for a little past 9pm - we have yet another three hours to kill. As the wind whips up to a quiet storm, the trio pace around the vehicle parking grounds that border the terminal building.</p> <p>Saftar and Ali eventually disappear again closer to 9pm. I want to speak to the driver. But the duo wave me back. On their return, they lead Wahid and I to a group of lorries idling at the far end of the park. It's a little past 9pm, pitch dark, and the port is almost deserted.</p> <p>The loading door to a plain-looking truck has been left open, and the four of us clamber in and pull the doors shut. The lorry contains several rows of wooden pallets and, following the trio's lead, I move towards the front of the container, hiding near the back of the cab.</p> <p>As we sit in the dark, Saftar starts to speak in low Punjabi tones. It's his first attempt at a conversation since we met more than six hours earlier: 'I have friends in England. They are in Kent, and I hope to find them. After a few months, perhaps I will go to London - there must be many jobs there.'</p> <p>Saftar and his friends - like most of the 90,000 asylum - seekers in the UK - want to benefit from the country's open economy.</p> <p>As asylum-seekers, they argue the right to fair and gainful employment. Saftar is escaping a land seizure that robbed him of his farm in Pakistan.</p> <p>'The farm was taken by enemies,' he sighs. 'It was a political problem. So what am I to do? Starve? I just want to work - I think there will be work for me in the UK.'</p> <p>There's an eerie silence in the lorry park - occasionally a truck rumbles past, presumably on its way into a ferry. Saftar and Ali are discussing the likelihood of entering Britain without passports.</p> <p>'I know other people who have done this,' says Ali. 'They hardly ever check the trucks - they don't have time to. They can't open everything and look through it.' Saftar nods silently in agreement, but the duo's bewildered expressions give them the begging look of men hoping for divine guidance.</p> <p>Ali tells me he used to live in a village outside Lahore. 'But with corruption, it's hard to make a living,' he says. 'I have relatives and friends over here - they make good money. I hope to make the same. I just want to be able to live and work in peace. In Pakistan, everything became too expensive. The cost of living was unbearable.'</p> <p>'I have been told there are a lot of Asians in the UK already,' he continues. 'Maybe some of them will be willing to help me. Any kind of job will do - you have to work hard to make a living.'</p> <p>Someone outside - presumably the driver - locks the doors. As we huddle closer, sinking into the lorry's floor, the truck starts to lurch to the right. Other vehicles in the lorry park start their engines and make their way over to the freight terminal.</p> <p>What follows is an agonisingly slow journey through the lorry park and into the ferry. It's a debilitating experience - this reduction to only being able to use sound as an indicator. The truck barely stops at the loading bay - and Saftar, Ali and Wahid are visibly encouraged by the silence that seems to disguise their passage.</p> <p>There is a faint sensation of the ferry making its way towards Dover, but we could equally have returned to the parking bay. The drivers, having parked their vehicles, have obviously made their way above deck.</p> <p>Surrounded by wooden pallets, Saftar reaches into his rucksack and pulls out an apple, which he proceeds to gnaw silently.</p> <p>Ali watches him with growing lack of interest, eventually pulling out an Urdu news magazine. It's too dark to read, so he lies down, closes his eyes and drifts into sleep. Occasionally, he will whisper tales of hope: 'There are jobs in the UK. I'll do anything. People like us can't be fussy - I think it's only fair that we work.'</p> <p>The 60-minute Channel crossing seems to hurry by as the lorry gently rocks on the waves across the Channel. Saftar continues to chew silently on his apple, while Ali catches up on some lost sleep. Wahid, in characteristic form, remains silent - he seems to have been brought into the group purely on means of his financial ability to pay for the journey.</p> <p>And it's hard not to feel sorry for the trio - having abandoned their homeland for a new life in Britain. They face certain detention or deportation if discovered. Almost 40 years before them, a wave of Asians arrived in similar circumstances - their evolution created a stable, prospering middle class.</p> <p>As I look at Saftar, Ali and Wahid, with their earnest talk of meritocracy and hard work, it's hard to doubt they have any intentions to the contrary.</p> <p>As the ferry stops, Saftar breathes a sigh of relief. 'I hope to find a job tomorrow,' he says, gleefully.</p> <p>The lorry starts again, picking up speed as it moves off the ferry. There is no indication of a customs check - a noise rattles the walls, but the door is left locked. Saftar quietly starts to bemoan his stiffening legs, then stops himself.</p> <p>The lorry driver gives no notice of an impending check; in fact, he has not been heard throughout the journey. A few gruff voices can be heard in the lorry bay, but none approach our vehicle.</p> <p>Ten minutes after landing, the lorry starts up again and heads off the dock. Saftar, Ali and Wahid hug each other in delight. Had they been captured, would they, at a later date, have made another attempt? 'Yes,' says Ali. 'Anything is better than being put inside a detention centre.' Paradoxically, a smiliar fate probably awaits him if discovered in Britain.</p> <p>A few miles from the centre of Dover, the lorry stops on the outskirts. There are few audible signs of traffic as the time approaches 11pm. The doors - loudly grating against the silence - are opened, and the lorry driver vanishes around the corner.</p> <p>It seems a curious trade - of course, the lorry drivers accept money from their asylum-seeking passengers, but their gift in return amounts to economic freedom.</p> <p>We're being let out, and as we scramble out of the back, Saftar trips and falls to the ground. He is helped to his feet by his fellow travellers, and, limping, he is moved to the shadows of the pavement. Saftar returns to the lorry to close the doors - and after a sharp slap against the side, the lorry moves off on its intended journey.</p> <p>The trio stand blinking in the night. 'You come with us?' asks Saftar, but it's an invitation made out of politeness only. Having endured around six months each at the detention centre in Sangatt, the trio share a bond and common destiny no outsider could comprehend.</p> <p>After a series of polite handshakes, they move away and begin to walk down back into the centre of Dover. They are in Britain. A new life has cost them \u00a3350.</p> <p><a href=\"burhan.wazir@observer.co.uk\">burhan.wazir@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

As the wind whips up to a quiet storm, the trio pace around the vehicle parking grounds that border the terminal building. Saftar and Ali eventually disappear again closer to 9pm. I want to speak to the driver. But the duo wave me back. On their return, they lead Wahid and I to a group of lorries idling at the far end of the park. It's a little past 9pm, pitch dark, and the port is almost deserted. The loading door to a plain-looking truck has been left open, and the four of us clamber in and pull the doors shut. The lorry contains several rows of wooden pallets and, following the trio's lead, I move towards the front of the container, hiding near the back of the cab. As we sit in the dark, Saftar starts to speak in low Punjabi tones. It's his first attempt at a conversation since we met more than six hours earlier: 'I have friends in England. They are in Kent, and I hope to find them. After a few months, perhaps I will go to London - there must be many jobs there.' Saftar and his friends - like most of the 90,000 asylum - seekers in the UK - want to benefit from the country's open economy. As asylum-seekers, they argue the right to fair and gainful employment. Saftar is escaping a land seizure that robbed him of his farm in Pakistan. 'The farm was taken by enemies,' he sighs. 'It was a political problem. So what am I to do? Starve? I just want to work - I think there will be work for me in the UK.' There's an eerie silence in the lorry park - occasionally a truck rumbles past, presumably on its way into a ferry. Saftar and Ali are discussing the likelihood of entering Britain without passports. 'I know other people who have done this,' says Ali. 'They hardly ever check the trucks - they don't have time to. They can't open everything and look through it.' Saftar nods silently in agreement, but the duo's bewildered expressions give them the begging look of men hoping for divine guidance. Ali tells me he used to live in a village outside Lahore. 'But with corruption, it's hard to make a living,' he says. 'I have relatives and friends over here - they make good money. I hope to make the same. I just want to be able to live and work in peace. In Pakistan, everything became too expensive. The cost of living was unbearable.' 'I have been told there are a lot of Asians in the UK already,' he continues. 'Maybe some of them will be willing to help me. Any kind of job will do - you have to work hard to make a living.' Someone outside - presumably the driver - locks the doors. As we huddle closer, sinking into the lorry's floor, the truck starts to lurch to the right. Other vehicles in the lorry park start their engines and make their way over to the freight terminal. What follows is an agonisingly slow journey through the lorry park and into the ferry. It's a debilitating experience - this reduction to only being able to use sound as an indicator. The truck barely stops at the loading bay - and Saftar, Ali and Wahid are visibly encouraged by the silence that seems to disguise their passage. There is a faint sensation of the ferry making its way towards Dover, but we could equally have returned to the parking bay. The drivers, having parked their vehicles, have obviously made their way above deck. Surrounded by wooden pallets, Saftar reaches into his rucksack and pulls out an apple, which he proceeds to gnaw silently. Ali watches him with growing lack of interest, eventually pulling out an Urdu news magazine. It's too dark to read, so he lies down, closes his eyes and drifts into sleep. Occasionally, he will whisper tales of hope: 'There are jobs in the UK. I'll do anything. People like us can't be fussy - I think it's only fair that we work.' The 60-minute Channel crossing seems to hurry by as the lorry gently rocks on the waves across the Channel. Saftar continues to chew silently on his apple, while Ali catches up on some lost sleep. Wahid, in characteristic form, remains silent - he seems to have been brought into the group purely on means of his financial ability to pay for the journey. And it's hard not to feel sorry for the trio - having abandoned their homeland for a new life in Britain. They face certain detention or deportation if discovered. Almost 40 years before them, a wave of Asians arrived in similar circumstances - their evolution created a stable, prospering middle class. As I look at Saftar, Ali and Wahid, with their earnest talk of meritocracy and hard work, it's hard to doubt they have any intentions to the contrary. As the ferry stops, Saftar breathes a sigh of relief. 'I hope to find a job tomorrow,' he says, gleefully. The lorry starts again, picking up speed as it moves off the ferry. There is no indication of a customs check - a noise rattles the walls, but the door is left locked. Saftar quietly starts to bemoan his stiffening legs, then stops himself. The lorry driver gives no notice of an impending check; in fact, he has not been heard throughout the journey. A few gruff voices can be heard in the lorry bay, but none approach our vehicle. Ten minutes after landing, the lorry starts up again and heads off the dock. Saftar, Ali and Wahid hug each other in delight. Had they been captured, would they, at a later date, have made another attempt? 'Yes,' says Ali. 'Anything is better than being put inside a detention centre.' Paradoxically, a smiliar fate probably awaits him if discovered in Britain. A few miles from the centre of Dover, the lorry stops on the outskirts. There are few audible signs of traffic as the time approaches 11pm. The doors - loudly grating against the silence - are opened, and the lorry driver vanishes around the corner. It seems a curious trade - of course, the lorry drivers accept money from their asylum-seeking passengers, but their gift in return amounts to economic freedom. We're being let out, and as we scramble out of the back, Saftar trips and falls to the ground. He is helped to his feet by his fellow travellers, and, limping, he is moved to the shadows of the pavement. Saftar returns to the lorry to close the doors - and after a sharp slap against the side, the lorry moves off on its intended journey. The trio stand blinking in the night. 'You come with us?' asks Saftar, but it's an invitation made out of politeness only. Having endured around six months each at the detention centre in Sangatt, the trio share a bond and common destiny no outsider could comprehend. After a series of polite handshakes, they move away and begin to walk down back into the centre of Dover. They are in Britain. A new life has cost them \u00a3350. burhan.wazir@observer.co.uk",

The car sashayed through a short cut and one arrived at the Savoy, which is not what it was, but still...</p> <p>One had to wait an age for Gerry, one's driver-cum-bodyguard, to open the door. One cannot get the staff these days. It's always jolly to swagger through the Savoy, taking in the clientele. There was a Mrs Marcos lookalike, a Middle Eastern arms dealer with his gorgeous tottie from Essex and a fat English lord snoring his head off, his trousers at half-mast.</p> <p>No riff-raff here, then.</p> <p>One wasn't recognised. It was only when my assistant, Ms Jordan, informed the young woman at the entrance to the River Room Restaurant that Lord Sweeney had arrived that people started to look up to one, and one down to them.</p> <p>The minion looked at one, paused, and ushered one to the best table in the house. The liquid history of the Thames flowed by. Nearby, a table full of toffs in pinstripes roared with laughter at someone's quip about the Inland Revenue.</p> <p>One had arrived.</p> <p>Another flunkey poured the Sancerre, and cringed agreeably while he waited for one's verdict. The age of deference is not dead yet.</p> <p>Gerry parked at the front of the hotel. A doorman came over: 'I'm waiting for Lord Sweeney,' said Gerry.</p> <p>'Oh, one of them arse holes. They always keep you waiting. Which bar is he in?'</p> <p>But then, mysteriously, he allowed Gerry to stay.</p> <p>Sadly, the world outside the Savoy was less obliging to a lord on the make.</p> <p>One's cover is that one made one's money selling dual-use equipment to the Iraqis and developing vacuum bombs. A bit of dosh to the New Labour coffers, and it was 'Arise, Lord Sweeney of Sweeney Mountain'. (A hill in Shropshire, as much a snow-capped peak as I will ever be a nob.)</p> <p>Pretending to be a lord is all the rage these days. Marc Philip Onslow Berkeley St Leger Curzon, the Marquis St Leger, got a lovely job off Wiltshire County Council and zoomed around in a Roller, until he was revealed as former publican and conman Keith 'Uncle Keith' Andrews, and received 18 months' jail for deception. Real New Labour lords can be a bit sly, too. Lord Alli - one of several life peers most unfairly dubbed 'Tony's cronies' - ran his business from his House of Lords address, to wry comment from old hereditaries.</p> <p>Becoming a fake lord isn't that difficult. A website comes in handy. William Fahy, of Willsolvit, on <a href=\"http://www.willsolvit.com,\" target=\"_NEW\">www.willsolvit.com</a>, knocked off a Lord Sweeney of Sweeney Mountain site double-quick, complete with snaps of Big Ben and the Dome and a bogus coat of arms - a severed arm holding a rapier atop three creepie crawlies rampant, with a dead rat recumbent, on a bed of custard and gangrene, beneath the motto: Sweeney Agonistes.</p> <p>One picked up an accommodation address: Sweeney Towers, Suite 401, 302 Regent Street, London W1R 6HH. They send on one's post, for \u00a350 a month. Fake address, fake website and fake crest in the bag, one's next step was some serious confidence trickery. One dreamt up a wheeze worthy of the Drones Club, mulching yew trees to find a major pharmacological breakthrough. First stop was Chase Manhattan in New York.</p> <p>'How much money?'</p> <p>'A lot of money.'</p> <p>'How much is a lot, sir?'</p> <p>'Fifty million, sterling, with a view to extend.'</p> <p>One was swiftly passed from an impressed-sounding receptionist to the delightful Matthew in Private Investment Capital. Immensely polite, though sadly unable to help one in one's million- dollar search, he passed one on to the amiable John at Chase Capital Partners. Nice, but not even a dollar.</p> <p>The Yank suggested a raft of other investment houses such as JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch.</p> <p>Not a cent. With the New World a dead loss, it was back to Blighty. How would one fare with our home-grown banks? First stop Coutts, the bank that likes to say yes. To snobs.</p> <p>M'lord was put through to a puzzled marketing department, who gently explained that Coutts didn't do investment in dodgy start-up projects, and was really a private bank for people with large current accounts. Oops.</p> <p>M'lord phoned the Big Bank, Barclays. A woman reluctantly agreed to send literature, though only under considerable lordly duress. She wanted to know the name of one's company. Hell, what was it called? 'Avanti,' one declared proudly. Bugger. Isn't that a brand of condoms?</p> <p>Then, one fancied a trip to New York. On Virgin's Upper Class, naturally. But on the cheap. One called Virgin reservations and was put through to the Upper Class hotline. One gave the dates. Nothing before noon. Lord Sweeney is not one to rise early. 'I don't blame him,' came the understanding response. Dates and times agreed, one got down to the nitty-gritty.</p> <p>An Upper Class return to New York, with driver on either side, costs \u00a33,595.70. Knowing Lord Sweeney, one explained the dilemma to saleswoman, Melanie.</p> <p>'Look, the problem is that Lord Sweeney, despite being a Lord, isn't exactly flush. Could he have it for less?'</p> <p>Sorry, came the reply, but that's the standard fare and there's no haggling.</p> <p>'But if he went for an economy fare, might he be bumped up to first class because he's a lord?' The upper classes firmly in their places in Upper Class and all that? 'No,' came the reply.</p> <p>Melanie politely explained that this wasn't Virgin policy, it might only happen in cases of overbooking. She suggested premium economy - a bargain at \u00a31,251.70. Basically the same service as economy, but seats are bigger and there's more legroom.</p> <p>What about meals? Would they be served on china with proper cutlery? No. Meals are the usual 'cellophane, pre-packed' economy fare. Good God, Lord Sweeney would be horrified! 'He's very fussy,' one cried, 'one doesn't think he'd put up with that. He might make a scene. Couldn't they make an exception? 'No,' said Melanie.</p> <p>'What if he is a friend of Sir Richard Branson?'</p> <p>That would be different, came the reply.</p> <p>Outside the House of Lords, things were little better. One donned one's ermine and cloak for a snap with the House of Lords in the background. Two working-class girls - one could tell because they used glottal stops - asked: 'What the fuck are you doing?' One found it quite discombobulating.</p> <p>Happily, two Swedish skinheads, Hengist and Horsa, were happy to be convinced that Lord Sweeney was real.</p> <p>The rest of London was more difficult to win over. One called on a man in a pub in Soho to buy a drink for Lord Sweeney of Sweeney Mountain.</p> <p>'Lord Who? Bugger off, I'm drinking.'</p> <p>Thus spake Everyman.</p> <p>Research: Sandra Jordan, Louise Tickle</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BMW whispered through London's streets, as outside the bogus asylum seekers, oiks and other scum stood snivelling in the driving rain, or screamed expletives at one another. Inside the luxury limousine the air conditioning was just a tad too cold, the leather upholstery a caress too soft on the buttocks. The car sashayed through a short cut and one arrived at the Savoy, which is not what it was, but still... One had to wait an age for Gerry, one's driver-cum-bodyguard, to open the door. One cannot get the staff these days. It's always jolly to swagger through the Savoy, taking in the clientele. There was a Mrs Marcos lookalike, a Middle Eastern arms dealer with his gorgeous tottie from Essex and a fat English lord snoring his head off, his trousers at half-mast. No riff-raff here, then. One wasn't recognised. It was only when my assistant, Ms Jordan, informed the young woman at the entrance to the River Room Restaurant that Lord Sweeney had arrived that people started to look up to one, and one down to them. The minion looked at one, paused, and ushered one to the best table in the house. The liquid history of the Thames flowed by. Nearby, a table full of toffs in pinstripes roared with laughter at someone's quip about the Inland Revenue. One had arrived. Another flunkey poured the Sancerre, and cringed agreeably while he waited for one's verdict. The age of deference is not dead yet. Gerry parked at the front of the hotel. A doorman came over: 'I'm waiting for Lord Sweeney,' said Gerry. 'Oh, one of them arse holes. They always keep you waiting. Which bar is he in?' But then, mysteriously, he allowed Gerry to stay. Sadly, the world outside the Savoy was less obliging to a lord on the make. One's cover is that one made one's money selling dual-use equipment to the Iraqis and developing vacuum bombs. A bit of dosh to the New Labour coffers, and it was 'Arise, Lord Sweeney of Sweeney Mountain'. (A hill in Shropshire, as much a snow-capped peak as I will ever be a nob.) Pretending to be a lord is all the rage these days. Marc Philip Onslow Berkeley St Leger Curzon, the Marquis St Leger, got a lovely job off Wiltshire County Council and zoomed around in a Roller, until he was revealed as former publican and conman Keith 'Uncle Keith' Andrews, and received 18 months' jail for deception. Real New Labour lords can be a bit sly, too. Lord Alli - one of several life peers most unfairly dubbed 'Tony's cronies' - ran his business from his House of Lords address, to wry comment from old hereditaries. Becoming a fake lord isn't that difficult. A website comes in handy. William Fahy, of Willsolvit, on www.willsolvit.com, knocked off a Lord Sweeney of Sweeney Mountain site double-quick, complete with snaps of Big Ben and the Dome and a bogus coat of arms - a severed arm holding a rapier atop three creepie crawlies rampant, with a dead rat recumbent, on a bed of custard and gangrene, beneath the motto: Sweeney Agonistes. One picked up an accommodation address: Sweeney Towers, Suite 401, 302 Regent Street, London W1R 6HH. They send on one's post, for \u00a350 a month. Fake address, fake website and fake crest in the bag, one's next step was some serious confidence trickery. One dreamt up a wheeze worthy of the Drones Club, mulching yew trees to find a major pharmacological breakthrough. First stop was Chase Manhattan in New York. 'How much money?' 'A lot of money.' 'How much is a lot, sir?' 'Fifty million, sterling, with a view to extend.' One was swiftly passed from an impressed-sounding receptionist to the delightful Matthew in Private Investment Capital. Immensely polite, though sadly unable to help one in one's million- dollar search, he passed one on to the amiable John at Chase Capital Partners. Nice, but not even a dollar. The Yank suggested a raft of other investment houses such as JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. Not a cent. With the New World a dead loss, it was back to Blighty. How would one fare with our home-grown banks? First stop Coutts, the bank that likes to say yes. To snobs. M'lord was put through to a puzzled marketing department, who gently explained that Coutts didn't do investment in dodgy start-up projects, and was really a private bank for people with large current accounts. Oops. M'lord phoned the Big Bank, Barclays. A woman reluctantly agreed to send literature, though only under considerable lordly duress. She wanted to know the name of one's company. Hell, what was it called? 'Avanti,' one declared proudly. Bugger. Isn't that a brand of condoms? Then, one fancied a trip to New York. On Virgin's Upper Class, naturally. But on the cheap. One called Virgin reservations and was put through to the Upper Class hotline. One gave the dates. Nothing before noon. Lord Sweeney is not one to rise early. 'I don't blame him,' came the understanding response. Dates and times agreed, one got down to the nitty-gritty. An Upper Class return to New York, with driver on either side, costs \u00a33,595.70. Knowing Lord Sweeney, one explained the dilemma to saleswoman, Melanie. 'Look, the problem is that Lord Sweeney, despite being a Lord, isn't exactly flush. Could he have it for less?' Sorry, came the reply, but that's the standard fare and there's no haggling. 'But if he went for an economy fare, might he be bumped up to first class because he's a lord?' The upper classes firmly in their places in Upper Class and all that? 'No,' came the reply. Melanie politely explained that this wasn't Virgin policy, it might only happen in cases of overbooking. She suggested premium economy - a bargain at \u00a31,251.70. Basically the same service as economy, but seats are bigger and there's more legroom. What about meals? Would they be served on china with proper cutlery? No. Meals are the usual 'cellophane, pre-packed' economy fare. Good God, Lord Sweeney would be horrified! 'He's very fussy,' one cried, 'one doesn't think he'd put up with that. He might make a scene. Couldn't they make an exception? 'No,' said Melanie. 'What if he is a friend of Sir Richard Branson?' That would be different, came the reply. Outside the House of Lords, things were little better. One donned one's ermine and cloak for a snap with the House of Lords in the background. Two working-class girls - one could tell because they used glottal stops - asked: 'What the fuck are you doing?' One found it quite discombobulating. Happily, two Swedish skinheads, Hengist and Horsa, were happy to be convinced that Lord Sweeney was real. The rest of London was more difficult to win over. One called on a man in a pub in Soho to buy a drink for Lord Sweeney of Sweeney Mountain. 'Lord Who? Bugger off, I'm drinking.' Thus spake Everyman. Research: Sandra Jordan, Louise Tickle",

      "body": "<p>In the end it was supercharged with drama. In a dawn swoop on Easter Saturday, Elian Gonz\u00e1lez was wrenched from the arms of Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman who rescued him from a floating inner tube last Thanksgiving Day, and delivered into those of federal government agents armed to the teeth and wearing riot helmets, bullet-proof vests and gas masks.</p> <p>Yesterday, as Eli\u00e1n's Miami family cranked up the hysteria in and around the house, crowds gathered to express their outrage.</p> <p>Hundreds of Cuban-Americans poured into the streets of Little Havana. Some threw rocks and shouted. Others waved signs and flags - Cuban and upside-down American ones. One man stalked through the crowd with a baby doll pinned to a cross, fake blood streaming from its hands.</p> <p>The fisherman himself was comfortless: weeping tears of rage, he shrieked at the nearest of the TV cameras taken as much by surprise as everyone else: 'What you see was wrong Sir. On the day of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ... Why? Why?'</p> <p>The raid was carried out by about 20 federal agents armed to the teeth and arriving in white vans. After three knocks on the door and 'identifying themselves' [as the parlance insists], the agents used a battering ram to force their way in and pepper spray to get back out again. The only compromise with gentility was the fact that a woman was employed to carry the boy out of the steps and into a waiting van.</p> <p>She spoke to Eli\u00e1n in Spanish: 'I know you are scared. This must be frightening but it will be over very soon. You are not going back to Cuba, you are not going on a boat, you are going to see your papa.'</p> <p>The stand-off between the government and the Cubans of Miami is now absolute; the swoop was ordered as exasperated Attorney General Janet Reno abandoned negotiations with a family she said had continually 'move the goalposts' and was still defiant in obstructing the law.</p> <p>Under a deal brokered by Miamia's Cuban leaders, the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez, had been asked to accept, in exchange of custody of Eli\u00e1n, a continuation of the close relationship that had developed between the boy and his father's Miami cousin, Marisleysis Gonz\u00e1lez.</p> <p>Around midnight the father and his lawyer made a counter offer, limiting the time that Marisleysis and her father, Lazaro Gonz\u00e1lez, could spend with them to a few weeks rather than for whatever time it takes for legal proceedings, at present preventing Elian's removal from the country, to be completed.</p> <p>But Reno and the boy's father came to the conclusion that little was to be gained from further attempts at direct negotiation. The Miami relatives had defied an order from the Immigration and Naturalisation Service on 13 April to hand the boy over to his father. Instead, they insisted on a prior meeting with him, at the same time demanding an independent investigation of their allegations that he was unfit to have custody because he had allegedly abused the child.</p> <p>Elian spent much of Friday on a swing in Lazaro Gonz\u00e1lez's back garden. As rumours that federal marshals were on their way ebbed and flowed, demonstrators reconstituted their human chain around the house in a crowd swelled by Cuban Americans coming from Good Friday church services.</p> <p>In the end Reno was left with little choice but to send her team in under cover of darkness. As the INS team knocked at and then battered down the door, Elian was wrenched from his bed and hidden in a cupboard. But not for long. He was grabbed by a male agent, under the watchful barrel of his colleague's gun and handed over to the Spanish-speaking woman. Then it was off and away - first by helicopter and then by plane to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland and his father.</p> <p>Reno explained why she had had to abandon a promise the boy would not be taken under cover of darkness. 'We had hoped,' she explained, 'that it could have been done another way. But the crowds began to suggest they were going to prevent it from happening...</p> <p>'[Elian's uncle] Lazaro had suggested people were going to have to run a gauntlet... With so much being unknown, the most important issue was to do it at a time that was safest for Elian, and safest for all concerned.'</p> <p>Within an hour of the raid, suddenly in the limelight, talking and weeping, was Marisleysis Gonz\u00e1lez. Having acted as the boy's surrogate mother, Marisleysis had been hidden from public view as a quiet but pivotal figure - periodically collapsing and being taken to hospital suffering from exhaustion, Now she became the Miami family's spokesperson.</p> <p>She displayed the boy's broken bed she claimed had been smashed by the feds, and invoked fire and brimstone on both the operation and President Clinton. 'If they had wanted to do this without violence, they would have made the father come to the house,' she began.</p> <p>Then she described her version of what had happened: 'Give me the boy else I'll shoot,' an agent apparently said. She claimed the agents put a gun to her chest.</p> <p>Savaging President Clinton personally, she shouted 'He has already dishonoured his family,and now he has dishonoured mine. And he has dishonoured this country.'</p> <p>The Miami Cuban diaspora is not used to losing. For four decades it has managed to call the shots in US politics, and especially with the Clinton administration, from whom the exiles had extracted their best ever embargo deal against the Havana regime.</p> <p>But on this one, the hardliners were doomed - doomed by the apathy for the old right-wing politics within their community, by American public copinion and above all by the law and Reno's determination to enforce it. This time, Havana and Washington were at one, with the Miami diaspora squeezed out, like a pip at the core of a Florida orange.</p> <p>The US government declared itself focused above all on the welfare of the child - and this seemed to be more and more precariously placed in the hands of his Uncle Lazaro and cousin Marisleysis.</p> <p>The psychiatrists and psychologists who had hitherto performed something of a charade were being taken seriously - the Miami Gonzalez family was not only defying the law, they were brainwashing the boy.</p> <p>There was a 'play pack' waiting on Eli\u00e1n's plane to Washington, said Doris Meissner, the INS Commissioner. She had been told that squeezing play-dough was therapeutic for children under stress, and there was play-dough on hand. Eli\u00e1n was fine, she said, 'He is a real terrific, tough kid'.</p> <p>The seizure of Eli\u00e1n enters the annals of heavy-handed but effective testosterone management by the US government. It's an illustrious line: from the 101st Airborne Regiment dispatched by Bobby Kennedy to desegregate Little Rock High School in 1958, to the debacle at Waco, Texas, in 1993.</p> <p>Reno insisted t they were tough, and tender, too. 'We did this as sensitively as we could,' said Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder. Clinton was 'in agreement' with the raid; actually, he ordered it.</p> <p><b>Who's who in tug-of-war</b></p> <p><b> The mother: Elizabet Bortons Rodr\u00edguez</b></p> <p>Drowned on voyage to US with Eli\u00e1n's step-father and nine others. Had been a waitress. Married Eli\u00e1n's father Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez when he was 16 and she 15. Eli\u00e1n's name came from a combination of his parents' - 'Eli' from Elizabet and 'an' from Juan. <br></p> <p><b> The father: Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez</b></p> <p>A national park worker. Although divorced from Elizabet, he had a good relationship with her and was devoted to Eli\u00e1n. Juan Miguel has denounced his Miami relatives on Cuban TV, berating them for turning Eli\u00e1n into a political symbol.</p> <p><b> The surrogate mother: Marisleysis Gonz\u00e1lez</b></p> <p>Eli\u00e1n's pretty cousin, 21, is a college drop-out who works as an assistant loan processor. The two have shared a room since Eli\u00e1n moved in with his Miami relatives. Marisleysis has been 'very stressed' about the prospect of losing Eli\u00e1n and has been hospitalised eight times since Eli\u00e1n's rescue at sea in late November, always for stress-related problems.</p> <p><b> The great-uncle: L\u00e1zaro Gonz\u00e1lez</b></p> <p>Marisleysis's father gained de facto temporary custody of Eli\u00e1n while the courts decided the boy's fate. He infuriated critics by allowing Eli\u00e1n to appear in media interviews and photoshoots. Things got nasty when Fidel Castro alleged L\u00e1zaro had sexually molested boys. He has a couple of drink-driving convictions.</p> <p><b> The grandmothers: Mareila Quintana and Raquel Rodr\u00edguez</b></p> <p>They travelled to the US in January and were allowed less than two hours with their grandson while fistfights broke out between factions outside. Anti-Cuban critics later accused the grandmothers of inappropriate behaviour when one admitted to 'biting' Eli\u00e1n's tongue because he was too timid to speak.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.libertyforelian.org/\" target=\"_new\">Campaign to keep Elian in US</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pathtofreedom.com/\" target=\"_new\">Let Elian go home</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.cubanet.org/\" target=\"_new\">Cubanet</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Department of State: The US and Cuba</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "In the end it was supercharged with drama. In a dawn swoop on Easter Saturday, Elian Gonz\u00e1lez was wrenched from the arms of Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman who rescued him from a floating inner tube last Thanksgiving Day, and delivered into those of federal government agents armed to the teeth and wearing riot helmets, bullet-proof vests and gas masks. Yesterday, as Eli\u00e1n's Miami family cranked up the hysteria in and around the house, crowds gathered to express their outrage. Hundreds of Cuban-Americans poured into the streets of Little Havana. Some threw rocks and shouted. Others waved signs and flags - Cuban and upside-down American ones. One man stalked through the crowd with a baby doll pinned to a cross, fake blood streaming from its hands. The fisherman himself was comfortless: weeping tears of rage, he shrieked at the nearest of the TV cameras taken as much by surprise as everyone else: 'What you see was wrong Sir. On the day of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ... Why? Why?' The raid was carried out by about 20 federal agents armed to the teeth and arriving in white vans. After three knocks on the door and 'identifying themselves' [as the parlance insists], the agents used a battering ram to force their way in and pepper spray to get back out again. The only compromise with gentility was the fact that a woman was employed to carry the boy out of the steps and into a waiting van. She spoke to Eli\u00e1n in Spanish: 'I know you are scared. This must be frightening but it will be over very soon. You are not going back to Cuba, you are not going on a boat, you are going to see your papa.' The stand-off between the government and the Cubans of Miami is now absolute; the swoop was ordered as exasperated Attorney General Janet Reno abandoned negotiations with a family she said had continually 'move the goalposts' and was still defiant in obstructing the law. Under a deal brokered by Miamia's Cuban leaders, the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez, had been asked to accept, in exchange of custody of Eli\u00e1n, a continuation of the close relationship that had developed between the boy and his father's Miami cousin, Marisleysis Gonz\u00e1lez. Around midnight the father and his lawyer made a counter offer, limiting the time that Marisleysis and her father, Lazaro Gonz\u00e1lez, could spend with them to a few weeks rather than for whatever time it takes for legal proceedings, at present preventing Elian's removal from the country, to be completed. But Reno and the boy's father came to the conclusion that little was to be gained from further attempts at direct negotiation. The Miami relatives had defied an order from the Immigration and Naturalisation Service on 13 April to hand the boy over to his father. Instead, they insisted on a prior meeting with him, at the same time demanding an independent investigation of their allegations that he was unfit to have custody because he had allegedly abused the child. Elian spent much of Friday on a swing in Lazaro Gonz\u00e1lez's back garden. As rumours that federal marshals were on their way ebbed and flowed, demonstrators reconstituted their human chain around the house in a crowd swelled by Cuban Americans coming from Good Friday church services. In the end Reno was left with little choice but to send her team in under cover of darkness. As the INS team knocked at and then battered down the door, Elian was wrenched from his bed and hidden in a cupboard. But not for long. He was grabbed by a male agent, under the watchful barrel of his colleague's gun and handed over to the Spanish-speaking woman. Then it was off and away - first by helicopter and then by plane to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland and his father. Reno explained why she had had to abandon a promise the boy would not be taken under cover of darkness. 'We had hoped,' she explained, 'that it could have been done another way. But the crowds began to suggest they were going to prevent it from happening... '[Elian's uncle] Lazaro had suggested people were going to have to run a gauntlet... With so much being unknown, the most important issue was to do it at a time that was safest for Elian, and safest for all concerned.' Within an hour of the raid, suddenly in the limelight, talking and weeping, was Marisleysis Gonz\u00e1lez. Having acted as the boy's surrogate mother, Marisleysis had been hidden from public view as a quiet but pivotal figure - periodically collapsing and being taken to hospital suffering from exhaustion, Now she became the Miami family's spokesperson. She displayed the boy's broken bed she claimed had been smashed by the feds, and invoked fire and brimstone on both the operation and President Clinton. 'If they had wanted to do this without violence, they would have made the father come to the house,' she began. Then she described her version of what had happened: 'Give me the boy else I'll shoot,' an agent apparently said. She claimed the agents put a gun to her chest. Savaging President Clinton personally, she shouted 'He has already dishonoured his family,and now he has dishonoured mine. And he has dishonoured this country.' The Miami Cuban diaspora is not used to losing. For four decades it has managed to call the shots in US politics, and especially with the Clinton administration, from whom the exiles had extracted their best ever embargo deal against the Havana regime. But on this one, the hardliners were doomed - doomed by the apathy for the old right-wing politics within their community, by American public copinion and above all by the law and Reno's determination to enforce it. This time, Havana and Washington were at one, with the Miami diaspora squeezed out, like a pip at the core of a Florida orange. The US government declared itself focused above all on the welfare of the child - and this seemed to be more and more precariously placed in the hands of his Uncle Lazaro and cousin Marisleysis. The psychiatrists and psychologists who had hitherto performed something of a charade were being taken seriously - the Miami Gonzalez family was not only defying the law, they were brainwashing the boy. There was a 'play pack' waiting on Eli\u00e1n's plane to Washington, said Doris Meissner, the INS Commissioner. She had been told that squeezing play-dough was therapeutic for children under stress, and there was play-dough on hand. Eli\u00e1n was fine, she said, 'He is a real terrific, tough kid'. The seizure of Eli\u00e1n enters the annals of heavy-handed but effective testosterone management by the US government. It's an illustrious line: from the 101st Airborne Regiment dispatched by Bobby Kennedy to desegregate Little Rock High School in 1958, to the debacle at Waco, Texas, in 1993. Reno insisted t they were tough, and tender, too. 'We did this as sensitively as we could,' said Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder. Clinton was 'in agreement' with the raid; actually, he ordered it. Who's who in tug-of-war The mother: Elizabet Bortons Rodr\u00edguez Drowned on voyage to US with Eli\u00e1n's step-father and nine others. Had been a waitress. Married Eli\u00e1n's father Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez when he was 16 and she 15. Eli\u00e1n's name came from a combination of his parents' - 'Eli' from Elizabet and 'an' from Juan. The father: Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez A national park worker. Although divorced from Elizabet, he had a good relationship with her and was devoted to Eli\u00e1n. Juan Miguel has denounced his Miami relatives on Cuban TV, berating them for turning Eli\u00e1n into a political symbol. The surrogate mother: Marisleysis Gonz\u00e1lez Eli\u00e1n's pretty cousin, 21, is a college drop-out who works as an assistant loan processor. The two have shared a room since Eli\u00e1n moved in with his Miami relatives. Marisleysis has been 'very stressed' about the prospect of losing Eli\u00e1n and has been hospitalised eight times since Eli\u00e1n's rescue at sea in late November, always for stress-related problems. The great-uncle: L\u00e1zaro Gonz\u00e1lez Marisleysis's father gained de facto temporary custody of Eli\u00e1n while the courts decided the boy's fate. He infuriated critics by allowing Eli\u00e1n to appear in media interviews and photoshoots. Things got nasty when Fidel Castro alleged L\u00e1zaro had sexually molested boys. He has a couple of drink-driving convictions. The grandmothers: Mareila Quintana and Raquel Rodr\u00edguez They travelled to the US in January and were allowed less than two hours with their grandson while fistfights broke out between factions outside. Anti-Cuban critics later accused the grandmothers of inappropriate behaviour when one admitted to 'biting' Eli\u00e1n's tongue because he was too timid to speak.

Elderton said: 'I wouldn't have a root filled on the NHS, and I don't know a dentist who would.' </p> <p>Many good dentists are outraged by the situation, but fearful of saying so publicly for fear of retribution from colleagues. Those doing NHS work also have a gagging clause in their contract, banning public criticism of NHS treatments. However, one dentist who has practised for 20 years, told The Observer : 'It's a disaster for the public. The worst part is that people are being told they are getting good treatment when they are not. The Government just don't care about quality, they are just happy that so many operations are being done at such a low cost. </p> <p>'People are being given loads of cheap fillings which are having to be redone every three years. Do you think dentists redo their own fillings every three years? Of course we don't. They should last 15 years.' </p> <p>Elderton, who carried out the study showing that four-fifths of crowns don't fit, said: 'It's professional incompetence. All the textbooks say make the crown fit. Otherwise it can lead to decay and gum disease, and the appearance can be affected'. </p> <p>However, Kravitz insisted the work was competent: 'Research shows that the average length of life of a crown in Britain is 15 years, which is quite good.' </p> <p>Many dentists complain that the NHS payment system encourages bad practice. One said: 'Many young dentists are arrogant. They work in a piecework situation with virtually no quality checks. They may start out good, but they generally work their way down to the lowest level. If you do two good fillings in the same time it takes to do 10 bad ones, you get more money for the bad ones. What would you end up doing? The bad guys win, and the good guys lose.' </p> <p>However, the situation is exacerbated by the lack of quality control on dentists, and the near impossibility of showing malpractice.

And who is to say the people doing the inspections are that smart?' </p> <p>Kravitz insisted that the problem was being addressed: 'We're all agreed that the quality of care could be improved - just as they could in medicine and law.

Figures disclosed to The Observer show that the number of complaints to the General Dental Council - the official disciplinary body which is made up almost exclusively of dentists - rose from 547 in 1996 to 782 last year. However, the number of dentists struck off or suspended for a short period rose from just eight in 1996 to 11 last year. 'I am amazed when I read that a dentist did this, that or the other and he was just admonished, not struck off. It's outrageous,' said Elderton, one of Britain's most respected academic dentists.

      "body": "<p>British Nuclear Fuels is planning to keep government proposals for privatisation on track by rejigging its accounts so as to present a \u00a362 million operating loss as a profit.</p> <p>In an interview with The Observer last week, chairman Hugh Collum expressed his concern that operating losses give City investors a negative picture of the company which could jeopardise his chances of delivering the Government's Public Private Partnership plans by 2002.</p> <p>Collum said he was asking auditors about reclassifying income BNFL gets from interest on investments as operating income.</p> <p>His strategy will be highly controversial. Earlier this month, BNFL was heavily criticised by Martin O'Neill, chairman of the influential commons Trade and Industry Select committee, for producing unclear accounts. </p> <p>Last week, BNFL finance director Ross Chiese was fired as part of a management and safety shake-up unveiled by Collum and chief executive Norman Askew. Collum said: 'From running the actual business, it's operating at a loss. The way it looks at the moment, people may feel that everything is going negative.' But he said BNFL gained interest from upfront payments for fuel reprocessing - payments currently classified as financial income.</p> <p>'You could argue that some of the interest you receive ought to be given credit [as operating income],' he said.</p> <p>The presentation of account was crucial, Collum said: 'This is our selling document for the PPP.'

      "bodyText": "British Nuclear Fuels is planning to keep government proposals for privatisation on track by rejigging its accounts so as to present a \u00a362 million operating loss as a profit. In an interview with The Observer last week, chairman Hugh Collum expressed his concern that operating losses give City investors a negative picture of the company which could jeopardise his chances of delivering the Government's Public Private Partnership plans by 2002. Collum said he was asking auditors about reclassifying income BNFL gets from interest on investments as operating income. His strategy will be highly controversial. Earlier this month, BNFL was heavily criticised by Martin O'Neill, chairman of the influential commons Trade and Industry Select committee, for producing unclear accounts. Last week, BNFL finance director Ross Chiese was fired as part of a management and safety shake-up unveiled by Collum and chief executive Norman Askew. Collum said: 'From running the actual business, it's operating at a loss. The way it looks at the moment, people may feel that everything is going negative.' But he said BNFL gained interest from upfront payments for fuel reprocessing - payments currently classified as financial income. 'You could argue that some of the interest you receive ought to be given credit [as operating income],' he said. The presentation of account was crucial, Collum said: 'This is our selling document for the PPP.' He added that any changes would be within accounting rules. Nuclear economist Gordon MacKerron of Sussex University, whose analysis of BNFL's accounts was given as evidence to the Trade and Industry Select Committee, said: 'It seems remarkable. I don't think it will fool anyone into thinking that the business is viable as an operation rather than as a manager of funds it has not earned itself, but received through historical circumstance. The fact remains that the company is operating at a loss.' MacKerron's evidence indicated that BNFL was able to turn its 1998/9 \u00a362m operating loss into a \u00a3228m pre-tax profit only through interest on cash and investments. These include upfront payments for reprocessing at its Thorp plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, as well as a \u00a32.6 billion cash pile for decommissioning when it acquired Magnox nuclear power stations in 1998 and a \u00a33.7bn IOU from the Government. MacKerron criticised BNFL for crediting its accounts with \u00a3249m from this IOU, even though the Treasury has not yet paid over the money. Collum says this is normal accounting practice. BNFL's accounts are opaque, and do not indicate which parts of the business - fuel manufacturing, Thorp, engineering, decommissioning, and Magnox - are operating profitably. Magnox is likely to be the biggest loss maker. It contributed a \u00a334m loss in the three months of 1998 during which it was included in the group, and electricity prices have fallen since then. Collum said more precise information would be provided when the company produces its next set of accounts later this year.",

      "body": "<p>The richest and most glamorous event in the British motorsporting calendar descended into farce yesterday when up to 50,000 fans were kept away - by muddy car parks.</p> <p>Only a few thousand racing enthusiasts managed to reach the Silverstone circuit after torrential rain prompted organisers to close all car parks for emergency repairs.</p> <p>Around 75,000 spectators were expected to watch drivers such as Michael Schumacher, Eddie Irvine and 20-year-old British newcomer Jenson Button battling for pole position on the grid in the final qualifying session for today's British Grand Prix.</p> <p>But only about 15,000 spectators made it to the Northamptonshire track after police mounted roadblocks and fans were warned not to bring their own cars. The recent downpours had turned around 200 acres of surrounding farmland - which usually take around 30,000 cars on Grand Prix weekend - into a quagmire. And more rain was expected last night to cause more problems today.</p> <p>Contractors worked all day yesterday putting down 300 tonnes of concrete to improve the car parks. Race organisers pledged that car parks would reopen today. No further problems were expected.</p> <p>Those determined to catch the action regardless of the chaos ended up parking in Northampton and Oxford, 14 and 25 miles away respectively. Taxi companies reported a roaring trade - and big fares - from disgruntled F1 followers. Silverstone spokesman Peter Morris insisted that 'many, many thousands' of fans had made it to the track. But television pictures showed largely empty stands during the morning practice session and lunchtime qualifying round, both marred by further showers.</p> <p>Morris said fans had shown great ingenuity in getting to Silverstone. Some had walked long distances through the countryside, others had cycled, and 4,000 others - businesspeople enjoying corporate hospitality packages - came by helicopter.</p> <p>Reg Watkins, one of the fans who made it to Silverstone yesterday, said: 'Conditions are appalling. There's water everywhere. The few punters who got their cars into the car parks before they closed have been watching their vehicles sinking further and further into the mud.'</p> <p>With more bad weather forecast today, there are fears that much of the sell-out crowd of 90,000 could encounter problems.</p> <p>Another veteran Grand Prix-goer, Charlie Vassell, said he was expecting the worst.</p> <p>'The corporate hospitality mob who come in by helicopter and have a nice cosy seat under cover in the grand stand will be OK,' he said. 'But most spectators will be on the grassy banks around the track and it looks as if we'll have a terrible time.</p> <p>'The banks will all quickly turn to mud because they're so waterlogged. Plus everyone will get splashed throughout the race by the drivers' cars chucking up spray. It'll be a complete mudbath.'</p> <p>This is the first time since 1993 that the British Grand Prix has been held on the Easter bank holiday weekend. In recent years it has been staged in July. Fans have criticised the FIA, motor racing's world governing body, for moving the event to a time when the weather is uncertain and the roads are busy.</p> <p>The chaos surrounding today's race may force a rethink. The race is due to switch from Silverstone to Brands Hatch in 2002.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The richest and most glamorous event in the British motorsporting calendar descended into farce yesterday when up to 50,000 fans were kept away - by muddy car parks. Only a few thousand racing enthusiasts managed to reach the Silverstone circuit after torrential rain prompted organisers to close all car parks for emergency repairs. Around 75,000 spectators were expected to watch drivers such as Michael Schumacher, Eddie Irvine and 20-year-old British newcomer Jenson Button battling for pole position on the grid in the final qualifying session for today's British Grand Prix. But only about 15,000 spectators made it to the Northamptonshire track after police mounted roadblocks and fans were warned not to bring their own cars. The recent downpours had turned around 200 acres of surrounding farmland - which usually take around 30,000 cars on Grand Prix weekend - into a quagmire. And more rain was expected last night to cause more problems today. Contractors worked all day yesterday putting down 300 tonnes of concrete to improve the car parks. Race organisers pledged that car parks would reopen today. No further problems were expected. Those determined to catch the action regardless of the chaos ended up parking in Northampton and Oxford, 14 and 25 miles away respectively. Taxi companies reported a roaring trade - and big fares - from disgruntled F1 followers. Silverstone spokesman Peter Morris insisted that 'many, many thousands' of fans had made it to the track. But television pictures showed largely empty stands during the morning practice session and lunchtime qualifying round, both marred by further showers. Morris said fans had shown great ingenuity in getting to Silverstone. Some had walked long distances through the countryside, others had cycled, and 4,000 others - businesspeople enjoying corporate hospitality packages - came by helicopter. Reg Watkins, one of the fans who made it to Silverstone yesterday, said: 'Conditions are appalling. There's water everywhere. The few punters who got their cars into the car parks before they closed have been watching their vehicles sinking further and further into the mud.' With more bad weather forecast today, there are fears that much of the sell-out crowd of 90,000 could encounter problems. Another veteran Grand Prix-goer, Charlie Vassell, said he was expecting the worst. 'The corporate hospitality mob who come in by helicopter and have a nice cosy seat under cover in the grand stand will be OK,' he said. 'But most spectators will be on the grassy banks around the track and it looks as if we'll have a terrible time. 'The banks will all quickly turn to mud because they're so waterlogged. Plus everyone will get splashed throughout the race by the drivers' cars chucking up spray. It'll be a complete mudbath.' This is the first time since 1993 that the British Grand Prix has been held on the Easter bank holiday weekend. In recent years it has been staged in July. Fans have criticised the FIA, motor racing's world governing body, for moving the event to a time when the weather is uncertain and the roads are busy. The chaos surrounding today's race may force a rethink. The race is due to switch from Silverstone to Brands Hatch in 2002.",

      "trailText": "The Last Supper",
      "byline": "Fiona Maddocks",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> The Last Supper </b> Deutsche Staatsoper, <b> </b> Berlin <p>Bewitched by numbers, codes and ciphers, Harrison Birtwistle hears the world as an irresistible mystery of patterns and correlations. Their arcane beauty is built into the brickwork of his music in a way that our senses discern, even if our ears may not always hear.</p> <p>His new opera, The Last Supper, which was given a resounding first performance in Berlin last Tuesday, is no exception. It opens with a dark fortissimo roar of tuba, timpani and synthesiser belting out 12 low D flats (which on a piano would be at that deep extremity of the keyboard where the ear begins to hear grumbles rather than notes). Out of this urgent, primeval sound, an eloquent trumpet fanfare emerges like light out of darkness. Of course, it's possible to read too much into this characteristic Birtwistle-esque juxtaposition of sounds. Yet it is not too far-fetched to see in those opening bars the seeds of the entire opera, whose subject matter is the encounter between the 12 disciples and Christ at the Last Supper. </p> <p>Birtwistle has set his chamber opera to a specially written text by the Canadian poet Robin Blaser (b 1925), rich in allusion and magpie borrowings from Christian liturgy, the Metaphysical poets and other sources ancient and modern. On paper it looked worryingly over-burdened, with interjections of Latin and Greek, aphoristic wisdoms and quasi-liturgical repetitions. But it was written to be sung not read, and in the theatre worked with astonishing clarity and good sense, a model libretto with barely a word in excess and most of it audible, especially when it most mattered. </p> <p>The work, labelled 'dramatic tableaux' by the creators, is set at the turn of the second millennium and looks back to that meeting between Christ and his disciples, as it was then and as it might be if a second chance were permitted. A chorus figure named 'Ghost', sung by the soprano Susan Bickley who negotiated a long and challenging vocal line with formidable ease, provides a commentary. Acting as an ever-present representation of the Holy Spirit and an intermediary between human and divine, she invites the disciples to supper 'once again - over bread and wine'.</p> <p>One by one they gather, appearing as if in slow motion though a brightly-lit tunnel in the centre of the stage. Each is sharply delineated in music and speech, 'ordinary salt-of-the-earth men caught up in something extraordinary', as Birtwistle has put it. James 'the Great' and James 'the Less', here called Little James, are paired vocally as countertenors, giving a striking timbre to the men's voices, otherwise split between tenors and baritones/basses. </p> <p>A question mark hangs over whether or not Judas, too, has been invited. They hope he hasn't. Suddenly, unnoticed, he arrives, adding 'Amen' to their singing of (a variant on) the Lord's Prayer. He carries a bolt of red cloth, the only noticeable colour in Alison Chitty's severely handsome, open-box design, otherwise dominated by shades of indigo and grey. Judas's arrival shocks, presaging the arrival of Christ, also unnoticed and dressed in white, in the mirroring style of a medieval mystery play. He atones for the disciples' sins, washing their feet one by one, reciting a litany of Man's crimes over the past 2,000 years. </p> <p>All are generic - the unmournable wars and killing fields, discrimination of man against man - except when it comes to Judas. At that point, Jesus turns to face the audience and sings 'The Holocaust shattered my heart'.</p> <p>To hear that line without flinching would be impossible, especially in Berlin, with its daily preoccupation with the new Liebeskind Jewish Museum and the prominent Holocaust memorial next to the Brandenberg Gate in preparation. Yet this literalness was in danger of endorsing the narrow focus of our times which judges, or would seem to judge, this as mankind's sole atrocity. It certainly struck an awkward note, though the moment passed without undue emphasis. After the supper, with all its intimations of betrayal, the work ends with Christ's voice asking out of the darkness 'Whom do you seek?' A cock crows and the curtain falls. In the end is also the beginning. </p> <p>This enthralling work, which runs without interval for two hours, has three main sections: Ghost's opening narration, the reunion of the disciples and their pagan-like dance, and the supper with Christ. Intercutting these sections, but not demarcating them, are three Visions. Like the Passing Clouds in Birtwistle's 1984 opera The Mask of Orpheus, they add another layer to the narrative (or anti-narrative, as it might better be called). In Martin Duncan's clear, unobtrusive staging, these Visions are enacted by a dumb-show on high at the back of the stage, based on precisely replicated images by Zurbaran. The Crucifixion, the Stations of the Cross and the Betrayal - in reverse order of events as we think of them - are played out, while a scintillating cascade of pre-recorded voices, electronic and live sounds play round the auditorium. </p> <p>The orchestral writing, skilfully handled by the Staatsoper orchestra under Daniel Barenboim, is sparse, with only 33 players in the pit.

      "bodyText": "The Last Supper Deutsche Staatsoper, Berlin Bewitched by numbers, codes and ciphers, Harrison Birtwistle hears the world as an irresistible mystery of patterns and correlations. Their arcane beauty is built into the brickwork of his music in a way that our senses discern, even if our ears may not always hear. His new opera, The Last Supper, which was given a resounding first performance in Berlin last Tuesday, is no exception. It opens with a dark fortissimo roar of tuba, timpani and synthesiser belting out 12 low D flats (which on a piano would be at that deep extremity of the keyboard where the ear begins to hear grumbles rather than notes). Out of this urgent, primeval sound, an eloquent trumpet fanfare emerges like light out of darkness. Of course, it's possible to read too much into this characteristic Birtwistle-esque juxtaposition of sounds. Yet it is not too far-fetched to see in those opening bars the seeds of the entire opera, whose subject matter is the encounter between the 12 disciples and Christ at the Last Supper. Birtwistle has set his chamber opera to a specially written text by the Canadian poet Robin Blaser (b 1925), rich in allusion and magpie borrowings from Christian liturgy, the Metaphysical poets and other sources ancient and modern. On paper it looked worryingly over-burdened, with interjections of Latin and Greek, aphoristic wisdoms and quasi-liturgical repetitions. But it was written to be sung not read, and in the theatre worked with astonishing clarity and good sense, a model libretto with barely a word in excess and most of it audible, especially when it most mattered. The work, labelled 'dramatic tableaux' by the creators, is set at the turn of the second millennium and looks back to that meeting between Christ and his disciples, as it was then and as it might be if a second chance were permitted. A chorus figure named 'Ghost', sung by the soprano Susan Bickley who negotiated a long and challenging vocal line with formidable ease, provides a commentary. Acting as an ever-present representation of the Holy Spirit and an intermediary between human and divine, she invites the disciples to supper 'once again - over bread and wine'. One by one they gather, appearing as if in slow motion though a brightly-lit tunnel in the centre of the stage. Each is sharply delineated in music and speech, 'ordinary salt-of-the-earth men caught up in something extraordinary', as Birtwistle has put it. James 'the Great' and James 'the Less', here called Little James, are paired vocally as countertenors, giving a striking timbre to the men's voices, otherwise split between tenors and baritones/basses. A question mark hangs over whether or not Judas, too, has been invited. They hope he hasn't. Suddenly, unnoticed, he arrives, adding 'Amen' to their singing of (a variant on) the Lord's Prayer. He carries a bolt of red cloth, the only noticeable colour in Alison Chitty's severely handsome, open-box design, otherwise dominated by shades of indigo and grey. Judas's arrival shocks, presaging the arrival of Christ, also unnoticed and dressed in white, in the mirroring style of a medieval mystery play. He atones for the disciples' sins, washing their feet one by one, reciting a litany of Man's crimes over the past 2,000 years. All are generic - the unmournable wars and killing fields, discrimination of man against man - except when it comes to Judas. At that point, Jesus turns to face the audience and sings 'The Holocaust shattered my heart'. To hear that line without flinching would be impossible, especially in Berlin, with its daily preoccupation with the new Liebeskind Jewish Museum and the prominent Holocaust memorial next to the Brandenberg Gate in preparation. Yet this literalness was in danger of endorsing the narrow focus of our times which judges, or would seem to judge, this as mankind's sole atrocity. It certainly struck an awkward note, though the moment passed without undue emphasis. After the supper, with all its intimations of betrayal, the work ends with Christ's voice asking out of the darkness 'Whom do you seek?' A cock crows and the curtain falls. In the end is also the beginning. This enthralling work, which runs without interval for two hours, has three main sections: Ghost's opening narration, the reunion of the disciples and their pagan-like dance, and the supper with Christ. Intercutting these sections, but not demarcating them, are three Visions. Like the Passing Clouds in Birtwistle's 1984 opera The Mask of Orpheus, they add another layer to the narrative (or anti-narrative, as it might better be called). In Martin Duncan's clear, unobtrusive staging, these Visions are enacted by a dumb-show on high at the back of the stage, based on precisely replicated images by Zurbaran. The Crucifixion, the Stations of the Cross and the Betrayal - in reverse order of events as we think of them - are played out, while a scintillating cascade of pre-recorded voices, electronic and live sounds play round the auditorium. The orchestral writing, skilfully handled by the Staatsoper orchestra under Daniel Barenboim, is sparse, with only 33 players in the pit. Much of it is antiphonal, featuring pairings of woodwind in the style of Bach's Passions (with which the entire work has many resonances). With no violins and an emphasis on low woodwind - alto flutes, cor anglais, bass clarinets and double bassoon - Birtwistle has created a powerfully melancholic soundworld, at once richly lyrical and hieratic. Throughout, either the vocal line or an obbligato instrument seems to forge through the piece like a stratum, over and above which instruments rush and buzz in flurries of agitated semiquavers like energised iron filings round a magnet. Creating yet another layer, the Chorus Mysticus - nine amplified female voices - and a pre-recorded chorus sing their own, Palestrina-like plainchant, but here the intervals are squeezed and dissonant. Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex is ever a distant echo. The British cast was outstanding, led by Thomas Randle and William Dazeley as Judas and Christ. The work, commissioned by Glyndebourne with the Staatsoper Berlin and the Royal Festival Hall, has further performances in Berlin between now and June.

Despite a major American tour last month, she is clearly eager for further concerts in Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Italy. She then goes on tour in Brazil. 'I am black. I am poor.

Mary Harron's movie version, co-scripted by feminist Guinevere Turner, isn't likely to shock anyone, partly because their mercifully brief adaptation of the book is a comic turn, and partly because the serial killer has become one of the cinema's stock characters this past decade. </p> <p>Bateman was clearly named to echo America's most famous movie psycho, Norman Bates, but the characters he most resembles are those more recent sociopathic figures fleeing from or attracted to the upper middle-class high life played by Edward Norton in Fight Club, Jude Law and Matt Damon in The Talented Mr Ripley, and Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. This very knowing picture, lit to give the New York scene a hard, metallic surface, is set in the Eighties, the 'me decade' that was supposedly more self-seeking than the 'caring Nineties'.

Mary Harron's movie version, co-scripted by feminist Guinevere Turner, isn't likely to shock anyone, partly because their mercifully brief adaptation of the book is a comic turn, and partly because the serial killer has become one of the cinema's stock characters this past decade. Bateman was clearly named to echo America's most famous movie psycho, Norman Bates, but the characters he most resembles are those more recent sociopathic figures fleeing from or attracted to the upper middle-class high life played by Edward Norton in Fight Club, Jude Law and Matt Damon in The Talented Mr Ripley, and Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. This very knowing picture, lit to give the New York scene a hard, metallic surface, is set in the Eighties, the 'me decade' that was supposedly more self-seeking than the 'caring Nineties'. Bateman is a man without any sense of identity who tends his body as if it were a sports car, tuning the engine with exercise, treating the surface with unguents. He's the ultimate other-directed man, caring only about acquisition, status and consumption. This narcissist is so empty that he seeks to externalise his inner turbulence by sadistic, homicidal acts. Or does he? Maybe the violence is all in the mind. American Psycho is a shallow movie, as two-dimensional as its hero, though in a performance that is convincingly American, eerily disturbing and edgily comic, Christian Bale brings Bateman to life.

He appeared as a tutelary figure in Tim Burton's Ed Wood . There has been a TV movie built around his notorious 1938 radio version of War of the Worlds that persuaded thousands of listeners that America was being invaded by Martians, and a few months ago there was another TV film about the scandals attendant on his first Hollywood film, Citizen Kane , in 1941. </p> <p>Now with the exhilarating Cradle Will Rock, Tim Robbins tells what the credits call 'A [Mostly] True Story' about the sensational production of Marc Blitzstein's Brechtian agitprop musical, The Cradle Will Rock , in 1937 by the federally subsidised theatre company called Project 891 that Welles and John Houseman ran in New York. It's for people who wince at the implications of the phrase 'he's history'. </p> <p>The film is a sort of dialectical mosaic that attempts to do for the 1930s what E.L. Doctorow's Ragtime did for the decade before the First World War. To achieve this, Robbins brings together three key events of the decade. The first is the commissioning in 1932 by enlightened plutocrat Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack) of a vast mural for the Rockefeller Center by the revolutionary Mexican artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades). In early 1934, before being unveiled, the work known as Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future was ground to dust because of its inflammatory radical character, though Rivera later re-created it in Mexico City. </p> <p>The second event is the appearance in December 1938 of Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones), the formidable head of the Federal Theatre, before the newly formed House Committee on Un-American Activities (Huac), a philistine organisation. This hearing, in which Flanagan ran rings around her Red-hunting interrogators, helped bring about the end of federal funding for the arts that had been launched as part of President Roosevelt's New Deal in 1934. </p> <p>Robbins has moved the Rivera affair ahead in time by three years, and the Huac hearings back by 18 months so that they exactly coincide with the extraordinary first performance of The Cradle Will Rock at a rundown Broadway theatre, the Venice. Project 891's own theatre had been suddenly closed and sealed by security guards following a federal economy drive aimed at radical artists. Because the actors' and musicians' unions refused to sanction a performance elsewhere, Houseman and Welles - in the ultimate realisation of the show-must-go-on ethos - mounted it as a one-man show with the composer Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria) at the piano. Members of the cast, wearing rehearsal clothes, gradually joined in from their seats in the audience following the courageous example of the inexperienced young actress Olive Stanton, a figure so amazing and so affectingly played by Emily Watson that one might suppose that Robbins invented her. He did not. </p> <p>Robbins works on as vast a canvas as Rivera's tendentious political mural, and with a comparably sharp, visual shorthand, caricaturing and glorifying in a similarly provocative manner. Rockefeller, Hearst and their oligarchic circle, buying up Old Masters, encouraging Nazis and fascists as a bulwark against communism, scheming to prevent a second American Revolution, are mocked. </p> <p>Hallie Flanagan, the sane non-communist with a vision of creating a genuine national theatre, is the heroine of the piece, along with Olive Stanton and an anti-fascist Italian-American actor played by John Turturro. Somewhere in between, the haughty Houseman (Cary Elwes) product of an English public school, and the histrionic Welles (Angus MacFadyen), in search of glory, are treated with a gentle humour. </p> <p>Over dinner at a fashionable restaurant after rehearsing a gritty musical about the overthrow of capitalism, the pair bicker like a married couple. Blitzstein's mentor, Bertolt Brecht, has a walk-on part, appearing in the composer's imagination to criticise and advise, and there is a touching, presumably fictitious character, an alcoholic vaudeville ventriloquist played brilliantly by Bill Murray, whose dummy takes over from him, making left-wing jokes and singing the 'Internationale'. The Huac politicians are given the rope of their official transcript with which to hang themselves. </p> <p> Cradle Will Rock closes with an image of the tame, unchallenging, neon-lit Times Square of today. It opens with a wonderful sequence announcing both a new dawn and a backstage story set against the background of a turbulent era. </p> <p>First seen stretched out behind a cinema screen, the homeless, unemployed Olive Stanton is literally awoken from sleep and figuratively awakened to politics. As she dresses, a newsreel carries items about the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the Nazis' exhibition of Decadent Art in Germany, Roosevelt opening a dam as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority, a fashion parade in Florida. Going out into the world, she washes her face at a fire hydrant as the camera pans up to the apartment where Blitzstein is struggling with his opera. </p> <p>The movie continues with a similar fluidity, cutting between its different narrative strands, introducing a vast array of people, vividly recreating a point in American life as the Depression is moving into the pre-war era. It's a time of hope and despair and the movie's final sequence cuts between a mock funeral, a theatrical celebration, and a party of capitalists in fancy dress discussing how to hang on to power. </p> <p>In an entertaining, if at times simplified manner (Robbins makes too light of communism), the picture examines the relationship between art and society. It dramatises the tug creative people feel between their need to adopt adversarial positions and the wish to be part of the community; and it confronts the perennial problem of pipers having to give account to those who pay for the tunes.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Passion Play</strong>,Donmar, London WC2 </p> <p><strong> Henry IV, Part One</strong>, Swan, Stratford </p> <p><strong> Snogging Ken</strong>, Almeida London N1 </p> <p><strong> The Threesome</strong>, Lyric Hammersmith, London W6 </p> <p>Passion Play is a blazing diagram of a drama. Michael Grandage has already staked a claim to be one of Britain's most illuminating directors with his As You Like It and The Jew of Malta. At the Donmar, he makes you feel that you are looking at the X-ray of a marriage. </p> <p>Peter Nichols's play, first staged in 1981, begins as an apparently predictable adultery-in-the-middle-classes story, with a 50-year-old married couple showing a younger woman how snug they are. You're pretty certain that a different intimacy will be established, and, sure enough, husband and young woman launch into an affair. </p> <p>What changes the play into something surprising, and penetrating, is a theatrical device. As the schism in the marriage becomes apparent to husband and wife, so each of them splits into two: each is played by two actors. A debate becomes a dance of death. </p> <p>Bland James (adroit James Laurenson), returning from a clandestine encounter, is coached by a worldly version of himself (an impish Martin Jarvis). Eleanor (beautifully poised Cherie Lunghi), remains composed when tipped off about her James's affair, but sprouts another self in Cheryl Campbell (wonderfully quizzical and crumpled), who explodes and prepares for fisticuffs. </p> <p>To watch these selves and second selves in different combinations is like watching someone plait hair: you never can tell the separateness of a strand. At times, Laurenson cradles Jarvis; at others, Jarvis and Campbell are impassively overlooked by Lunghi and Laurenson. In one brilliantly balletic scene, husband and wife and their dark shadows prepare to make love on a sofa; when the doorbell goes, four heads spring up in alarm. </p> <p>There are cracks in this play. The troublesome young woman (only one of her) is badly underwritten. The title, which refers to human love and to Christ's death, bestows unearned magnificence on the couple's pain - one of them is restoring a painting of the Crucifixion, the other is singing an 'Agnus Dei' while her partner makes love. But there's no gainsaying the grip of the piece, swelled by Bach's music and enhanced by Christopher Oram's design: as the light fades on the blocks of the back wall, the central struts glow like a cross. </p> <p>The RSC's history cycle is wheeling from one kind of strength to another. Under Stephen Pimlott's direction, Richard II was biting and modern. Now Michael Attenborough has directed a swirling, emotional, vibrant <strong> Henry IV </strong> set in a fourteenth-century twilight. </p> <p>Es Devlin's cinder-grey design has only one splash of colour, that of a golden robe draped on the throne. In a stroke, the glister and the grit of the play are registered and the Swan is made into an arena fit both for battle and for melting exchanges. </p> <p>The fights and rough-house scenes are exciting: Adam Levy is a fizzing Hotspur and William Houston, though too often wearing an inappropriate smile, is an arresting, calculating Hal; as Bardolph, Arthur Cox has perfect pitch. But it is the tender episodes - the sad sequence of leave-takings, between husbands and wives and fathers and sons - that are outstanding. These would have been even more striking had not David Troughton turned the king into a creature of bombast and a choppy verse-speaker. </p> <p>The beguiling thing about Desmond Barrit's performance as Falstaff is his sense of complete relaxation. His body seems to be built on an entirely different scale from those around him. Melancholy murmurs escape him like the creaking of his big bones. He may adopt an actorly swagger to utter his biggest lies, but his most gorgeous phrases roll from him naturally, as if he were sweating adjectives. </p> <p>Tariq Ali, Howard Brenton and Andy de la Tour have slipped their new satirical sketch about the election for London mayor on to the sleek set designed for the Pinter double-bill at the Almeida. <strong> Snogging Ken</strong> is a promising title for a skit, suggesting a sexual declension in the candidates - working down from 'Shagger' Norris. Some of its points are on the button: one character observes that while Londoners have a fondness for Livingstone's GLC, they can't remember much about what it did - it's all a blur of fireworks and fares. </p> <p>None of Snogging Ken is subversive - it's the chat of Londoners put on stage. There's some point in that, but the authors provide a manifesto declaring that 'if more than a few London critics ever like our work, we will be duty bound to ask ourselves where we went wrong'. What would they feel about the woman next to me who remarked to her companion: 'Nothing wrong about having your prejudices confirmed'? </p> <p>At the Lyric Hammersmith, Neil Bartlett as translator and Gordon Anderson as director are attempting to justify the ways of French farce by staging <strong> The Threesome</strong> by nineteenth-century playwright Eug\u00e8ne Labiche, author of The Italian Straw Hat . This tale of a skilfully concealed liaison in which the duped party ends up double-duped, is steeped in heavy Victorian decorum and accoutrements - a moose head, a summerhouse - while the action moves with the speed of a guillotine. </p> <p>What should be an extended panic attack is here more like a series of indigestion disorders. The production doesn't sizzle, but it purrs. As a barmy Alsatian (with a beetle in his lederhosen), Paul Bradley seesaws between silliness and solemnity. And Deborah Findlay can suggest a week of pleasure and disdain with one lift of her upper lip.</p>",

Peter Nichols's play, first staged in 1981, begins as an apparently predictable adultery-in-the-middle-classes story, with a 50-year-old married couple showing a younger woman how snug they are. You're pretty certain that a different intimacy will be established, and, sure enough, husband and young woman launch into an affair. What changes the play into something surprising, and penetrating, is a theatrical device. As the schism in the marriage becomes apparent to husband and wife, so each of them splits into two: each is played by two actors. A debate becomes a dance of death. Bland James (adroit James Laurenson), returning from a clandestine encounter, is coached by a worldly version of himself (an impish Martin Jarvis). Eleanor (beautifully poised Cherie Lunghi), remains composed when tipped off about her James's affair, but sprouts another self in Cheryl Campbell (wonderfully quizzical and crumpled), who explodes and prepares for fisticuffs. To watch these selves and second selves in different combinations is like watching someone plait hair: you never can tell the separateness of a strand. At times, Laurenson cradles Jarvis; at others, Jarvis and Campbell are impassively overlooked by Lunghi and Laurenson. In one brilliantly balletic scene, husband and wife and their dark shadows prepare to make love on a sofa; when the doorbell goes, four heads spring up in alarm. There are cracks in this play. The troublesome young woman (only one of her) is badly underwritten. The title, which refers to human love and to Christ's death, bestows unearned magnificence on the couple's pain - one of them is restoring a painting of the Crucifixion, the other is singing an 'Agnus Dei' while her partner makes love. But there's no gainsaying the grip of the piece, swelled by Bach's music and enhanced by Christopher Oram's design: as the light fades on the blocks of the back wall, the central struts glow like a cross. The RSC's history cycle is wheeling from one kind of strength to another. Under Stephen Pimlott's direction, Richard II was biting and modern. Now Michael Attenborough has directed a swirling, emotional, vibrant Henry IV set in a fourteenth-century twilight. Es Devlin's cinder-grey design has only one splash of colour, that of a golden robe draped on the throne. In a stroke, the glister and the grit of the play are registered and the Swan is made into an arena fit both for battle and for melting exchanges. The fights and rough-house scenes are exciting: Adam Levy is a fizzing Hotspur and William Houston, though too often wearing an inappropriate smile, is an arresting, calculating Hal; as Bardolph, Arthur Cox has perfect pitch. But it is the tender episodes - the sad sequence of leave-takings, between husbands and wives and fathers and sons - that are outstanding. These would have been even more striking had not David Troughton turned the king into a creature of bombast and a choppy verse-speaker. The beguiling thing about Desmond Barrit's performance as Falstaff is his sense of complete relaxation. His body seems to be built on an entirely different scale from those around him. Melancholy murmurs escape him like the creaking of his big bones. He may adopt an actorly swagger to utter his biggest lies, but his most gorgeous phrases roll from him naturally, as if he were sweating adjectives. Tariq Ali, Howard Brenton and Andy de la Tour have slipped their new satirical sketch about the election for London mayor on to the sleek set designed for the Pinter double-bill at the Almeida. Snogging Ken is a promising title for a skit, suggesting a sexual declension in the candidates - working down from 'Shagger' Norris. Some of its points are on the button: one character observes that while Londoners have a fondness for Livingstone's GLC, they can't remember much about what it did - it's all a blur of fireworks and fares. None of Snogging Ken is subversive - it's the chat of Londoners put on stage. There's some point in that, but the authors provide a manifesto declaring that 'if more than a few London critics ever like our work, we will be duty bound to ask ourselves where we went wrong'. What would they feel about the woman next to me who remarked to her companion: 'Nothing wrong about having your prejudices confirmed'? At the Lyric Hammersmith, Neil Bartlett as translator and Gordon Anderson as director are attempting to justify the ways of French farce by staging The Threesome by nineteenth-century playwright Eug\u00e8ne Labiche, author of The Italian Straw Hat . This tale of a skilfully concealed liaison in which the duped party ends up double-duped, is steeped in heavy Victorian decorum and accoutrements - a moose head, a summerhouse - while the action moves with the speed of a guillotine. What should be an extended panic attack is here more like a series of indigestion disorders. The production doesn't sizzle, but it purrs. As a barmy Alsatian (with a beetle in his lederhosen), Paul Bradley seesaws between silliness and solemnity. And Deborah Findlay can suggest a week of pleasure and disdain with one lift of her upper lip.",

And nowhere is this more evident than in music, an arena in which Brits have traditionally set the pace for the rest of the world. 'It's true that other countries, America in particular, did look to us for guidance, particularly where alternative music was concerned,' remarked senior pop citizen Sting in the Times last weekend. 'Now they make their own. The world has changed.'</p> <p>The world has certainly changed since the Beatles first stepped off the plane at Idlewild Airport in 1963, an epochal moment which consolidated the 'special relationship' Britain had always enjoyed with the US. 'America needed someone to fall in love with after Kennedy died and there the Beatles were,' says LA rock b\u00e9te noire Kim Fowley, notorious former manager of the Runaways. America also needed someone to shake it out of its post-Eisenhower slumber. Perhaps this was why the arrival of the Beatles was seen as an 'invasion', a term suggesting the ambiguity Americans felt about the way British bands (the Stones, the Who et al) took black American R&amp;B, refashioned it as delinquent white angst, and fed it back to the would-be punks of America's suburban garages.</p> <p>The Beatles not only came, saw, and conquered, introducing the US to cheeky-chappie charm and wit at a time when most American boys were dorks with ducktails, but they transformed 'pop' into a credible art form, setting off wave after wave of musical change.</p> <p>From late Sixties heavy metal to early Eighties synth pop, Brits were at the cutting edge of pop's evolution. Since the 'second British invasion' of Boy George and Sting, however, the 'special relationship' between the two countries has counted for a lot less than it did in the days of Swinging London. Gone for good is the era when skinny Brits could saunter along Sunset Boulevard and take their pick of blonde goddesses on the strength of their monosyllabic Anglo-Saxon grunting. The mid-Nineties Britpop explosion of Blur and Oasis was the last chance to convince America it still needed us - and it failed.</p> <p>'There's a particular kind of British classic rock that doesn't really translate at this point,' says Ann Powers, music critic for the New York Times. 'Part of that has to do with America's fascination with hip hop. Hip hop, unlike blues in the Sixties, hasn't been taken up by British artists and made more interesting the way the Stones and Eric Clapton did with blues. Hip hop and R&amp;B are really flavouring mainstream American pop, so what British pop is about is just not interesting to mainstream audiences.'</p> <p>For the vast majority of American teens and twentysomethings, talk of British invasions has become a non-issue. To them, the Beatles are as remote and mummified as Elvis Presley. Pockets of Anglophilia survive, but Americans have slowly been waking up to their own national treasures, from Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams to Captain Beefheart and Tom Waits. Unimpressed by the surly grandchildren of the Beatles and the Who, they have gone back to what Greil Marcus calls 'the old, weird America' of Harry Smith's seminal Anthology of American Music. In the words of Beck, whose playful melange of blues, folk, funk and hip hop owes little to British influence: 'The boggy wasteland of the American spirit is more fluorescent than ever.'</p> <p>'There used to be this fascination with European bohemian life,' says Powers, whose newly-published Weird Like Us: My Bohemian America (Simon Schuster $23) examines the way 'alternative' culture has seeped into the US mainstream. 'But it's just not what kids are looking to now. It's as though there's been enough of an American tradition, especially in terms of the bohemian slacker culture of the Eighties and Nineties, which is very focused on American popular culture and looks to that for inspiration.'</p> <p>Significantly, the most critically lauded albums of the past decade, both in America and here, have been by hybridising artists such as Beck, by hip hop and R&amp;B acts such as the Fugees and TLC, and by such practitioners of refracted Americana as Lambchop and Mercury Rev. The 1999 Album of the Year in NME wasn't by Blur or even Death in Vegas but by oddball Oklahomans, the Flaming Lips. (I don't count Radiohead, whose music transcends the whole issue of Britrock anyway.) True, Britain's electronic underground has had an impact in America, kick-starting the overhyped and ultimately ephemeral 'electronica' vogue of 1997, but dance music culture is too amorphous and pan-European to make any difference to the way Americans perceive our culture. You're more likely to hear Underworld or the Chemical Brothers on a TV ad than you are to hear them on the radio.</p> <p>'Americans want to be shocked by British bands,' says Laurence Bell of Domino Records, British home to Smog, Palace and other US mavericks. 'When the Beatles went over there, it was like, \"What is this? Who are these guys?\" Now there's no real intelligence or exoticism. Obviously, we're setting the pace in electronic music, but Americans stopped caring about Britrock years ago. They see these bands come in on waves of hype who can't even play their instruments and they're just not interested.'</p> <p>Several reasons could be given for the perplexing reversal of fortune. One is that Britain never produced a Kurt Cobain or, for that matter, an adequate response to grunge (unless you count Bush). Another is that Americans are less and less concerned with what's going on outside their huge country, with its internal diversity and plurality. This we know from the relegation of stories about Zimbabwe to the middle or back pages to make way for the minutiae of the Elian Gonzalez case.</p> <p>'In a negative sense, I would say America's become more provincial,' says Ann Powers. 'Even though capitalism has become global, our own focus has become myopic.' Still another is the tired theory of Yanks not getting our amazingly subtle 'irony' (when did Britain last produce a TV show as witheringly ironic as The Simpsons?). More troubling, at least to some, is the possibility that we have ourselves become so Americanised that our cultural products no longer bear the true stamp of our national character.</p> <p>A more convincing analysis might be that America has taken what it needs from British pop - style, irreverence, artistic daring - and simply moved on. In a country of 280 million, where Spanish is about to become the dominant language, 'Cool Britannia' has become just another ice-cream flavour. London is calling but America ain't home.</p> <p>'It would seem that America has assimilated what it's needed to take out of British pop culture in the past 40 years, and there really isn't that much that Britain has to offer right now,' says Nic Harcourt, Birmingham-born host of KCRW's influential Morning Becomes Eclectic show in Los Angeles. 'I wouldn't say that no British bands are ever going to break through again - Travis look like they might do it - but America at this point is the great global experiment. It may still be very white in the middle, but in the cities there's now such a tapestry of cultures. Nothing really stands out so much anymore, and certainly not Britrock.'</p> <p>Between Da Brat and Shania Twain, Ricky Martin and Rage Against the Machine, Americans appear to have everything they need, with every genre neatly tailored to its appropriate demographic. Between the Listerine teenpop of 'N Sync and the testosterone jock metal of Limp Bizkit, American radio offers few holes for square pegs such as Supergrass, P.J. Harvey or Massive Attack. Or even for Robbie Williams. These days, we can't even compete with America's boy bands.</p> <p>In the new virtual global village, with the world at our electronic fingertips, the very concept of Britishness looks ever more anachronistic. Maybe it's time we stopped looking to America for its approval.</p> <p>\u0095 Barney Hoskyns's recent books include Glam!

The mid-Nineties Britpop explosion of Blur and Oasis was the last chance to convince America it still needed us - and it failed. 'There's a particular kind of British classic rock that doesn't really translate at this point,' says Ann Powers, music critic for the New York Times. 'Part of that has to do with America's fascination with hip hop. Hip hop, unlike blues in the Sixties, hasn't been taken up by British artists and made more interesting the way the Stones and Eric Clapton did with blues. Hip hop and R&amp;B are really flavouring mainstream American pop, so what British pop is about is just not interesting to mainstream audiences.' For the vast majority of American teens and twentysomethings, talk of British invasions has become a non-issue. To them, the Beatles are as remote and mummified as Elvis Presley. Pockets of Anglophilia survive, but Americans have slowly been waking up to their own national treasures, from Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams to Captain Beefheart and Tom Waits. Unimpressed by the surly grandchildren of the Beatles and the Who, they have gone back to what Greil Marcus calls 'the old, weird America' of Harry Smith's seminal Anthology of American Music. In the words of Beck, whose playful melange of blues, folk, funk and hip hop owes little to British influence: 'The boggy wasteland of the American spirit is more fluorescent than ever.' 'There used to be this fascination with European bohemian life,' says Powers, whose newly-published Weird Like Us: My Bohemian America (Simon Schuster $23) examines the way 'alternative' culture has seeped into the US mainstream. 'But it's just not what kids are looking to now. It's as though there's been enough of an American tradition, especially in terms of the bohemian slacker culture of the Eighties and Nineties, which is very focused on American popular culture and looks to that for inspiration.' Significantly, the most critically lauded albums of the past decade, both in America and here, have been by hybridising artists such as Beck, by hip hop and R&amp;B acts such as the Fugees and TLC, and by such practitioners of refracted Americana as Lambchop and Mercury Rev. The 1999 Album of the Year in NME wasn't by Blur or even Death in Vegas but by oddball Oklahomans, the Flaming Lips. (I don't count Radiohead, whose music transcends the whole issue of Britrock anyway.) True, Britain's electronic underground has had an impact in America, kick-starting the overhyped and ultimately ephemeral 'electronica' vogue of 1997, but dance music culture is too amorphous and pan-European to make any difference to the way Americans perceive our culture. You're more likely to hear Underworld or the Chemical Brothers on a TV ad than you are to hear them on the radio. 'Americans want to be shocked by British bands,' says Laurence Bell of Domino Records, British home to Smog, Palace and other US mavericks. 'When the Beatles went over there, it was like, \"What is this? Who are these guys?\" Now there's no real intelligence or exoticism. Obviously, we're setting the pace in electronic music, but Americans stopped caring about Britrock years ago. They see these bands come in on waves of hype who can't even play their instruments and they're just not interested.' Several reasons could be given for the perplexing reversal of fortune. One is that Britain never produced a Kurt Cobain or, for that matter, an adequate response to grunge (unless you count Bush). Another is that Americans are less and less concerned with what's going on outside their huge country, with its internal diversity and plurality. This we know from the relegation of stories about Zimbabwe to the middle or back pages to make way for the minutiae of the Elian Gonzalez case. 'In a negative sense, I would say America's become more provincial,' says Ann Powers. 'Even though capitalism has become global, our own focus has become myopic.' Still another is the tired theory of Yanks not getting our amazingly subtle 'irony' (when did Britain last produce a TV show as witheringly ironic as The Simpsons?). More troubling, at least to some, is the possibility that we have ourselves become so Americanised that our cultural products no longer bear the true stamp of our national character. A more convincing analysis might be that America has taken what it needs from British pop - style, irreverence, artistic daring - and simply moved on. In a country of 280 million, where Spanish is about to become the dominant language, 'Cool Britannia' has become just another ice-cream flavour. London is calling but America ain't home. 'It would seem that America has assimilated what it's needed to take out of British pop culture in the past 40 years, and there really isn't that much that Britain has to offer right now,' says Nic Harcourt, Birmingham-born host of KCRW's influential Morning Becomes Eclectic show in Los Angeles. 'I wouldn't say that no British bands are ever going to break through again - Travis look like they might do it - but America at this point is the great global experiment. It may still be very white in the middle, but in the cities there's now such a tapestry of cultures. Nothing really stands out so much anymore, and certainly not Britrock.' Between Da Brat and Shania Twain, Ricky Martin and Rage Against the Machine, Americans appear to have everything they need, with every genre neatly tailored to its appropriate demographic. Between the Listerine teenpop of 'N Sync and the testosterone jock metal of Limp Bizkit, American radio offers few holes for square pegs such as Supergrass, P.J. Harvey or Massive Attack. Or even for Robbie Williams. These days, we can't even compete with America's boy bands. In the new virtual global village, with the world at our electronic fingertips, the very concept of Britishness looks ever more anachronistic. Maybe it's time we stopped looking to America for its approval. \u0095 Barney Hoskyns's recent books include Glam!

It doesn't matter that the scene is heavily ironic - far from being a compliant housewife, Bening is a shrewish estate agent desperately primping one of her properties - Parsons's response suggests that for many men there's always been something singularly satisfying about a sexy woman getting down to some hard domestic graft. </p> <p>Far stranger is the growing band of woman who declare themselves, if not exactly turned on, then certainly deeply pleasured by the idea of keeping house. More specifically, keeping house with as much bother as possible. Creating a place where you can turn dinner guests loose without worrying that they'll stumble across evidence of your threat to public health is nice, but that isn't the point. The new domestics actually enjoy the process of creating order out of chaos, and to prove it they do it with as much inconvenience to themselves as possible. Time-saving strategies - a Dyson, three sorts of Mr Muscle, a twice-weekly Croatian - are, they say, spoiling the fun. Expending elbow grease is a crucial part of the pleasure. </p> <p>'There's nothing more soothing than coming home after a hard day's work and doing a basket full of ironing,' confirms Jane Sampson, 42, a property consultant. 'And the nastier the day, the more I want to do housework. When I was going through my divorce I had kitchen cupboards that would have gladdened any drill sergeant's heart.' When pushed, Sampson admits that there's a dark psychological side to all this: 'Yes, I know it's all about making order out of some spectacularly nasty chaos, but who cares? It works for me.' </p> <p>The high priestess of born-again domestics such as Sampson is Cheryl Mendelson, the American academic who recently published up a storm with her unlikely bestseller, Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping Home (Scribner $35). The book has nothing to do with nostalgic top-dressing, and you won't find a lavender bag or distressed Tuscan tile in sight. Instead, what Mendelson advocates is the kind of back-breaking routine she learnt from her Appalachian farmhouse grannies in the Fifties. Thus Mendelson seriously suggests that you do your washing on Monday, odd jobs on Tuesday, and so on even if, like her, you live in Manhattan. The book is nearly 900 pages and consists of nitty gritty chapters with titles like 'Aprons, Rags and Mops'. There's a right way to roll up socks, apparently, and an essential way to wash your hands (Mendelson says to get them really clean you should be able to hum right through 'Yankee Doodle'. Obviously we need to substitute here, so watch out in the office lav for people who insist on muttering the words to 'Maybe It's Because I'm a Londoner' - they're the clean ones). </p> <p>Mendelson says that her book is a way of honouring women's work, that rich tradition of domestic knowledge, labour and mystery which has so often seemed invisible to historians. In this she follows the example of Mrs Beeton, whose aim in publishing The Book of Household Management in 1861 was to give middle-class women a sense of pride in their domestic skills and achievements. Beeton compared the mistress of the house to an army general, and briefed her readers with the facts, figures and strategies which would enable them to run their household with military precision. </p> <p>This talked-up moral urgency made perfect compensatory sense in a world where middle-class women were barred from any kind of labour outside the home. But Cheryl Mendelson, who is often called the new Mrs Beeton, has no need to convince anyone of her usefulness. With a law degree from Harvard, a PhD in philosophy and a teaching job at Columbia, she has hardly been twiddling her thumbs. But here's the thing: Mendelson claims that all those years when she was working 60-hour weeks and coming home to an empty fridge and unsorted socks made her miserable. It wasn't until her second marriage in 1990 that she felt strong enough to admit that what she really wanted to do was keep house in as fiddly and time-consuming way as possible. </p> <p>The fact that Home Comforts has sold around 200,000 copies in a few months suggests that it is much more than a gimmicky, counter-intuitive statement which pleases the press for a day, but soon passes. In any case, Mendelson is not the first writer to suggest recently that spiritual peace is to be found by dusting properly under your bed. Sarah Ban Breathnach is a domestic historian turned self-help guru whose two-million selling Simple Abundance: A Daybook of Comfort &amp; Joy (Bantam \u00a312.99) maintains that making your own jam is a moral act, and a deeply satisfying one at that. In America there are 'Simple Abundance' support groups where teachers, doctors and lawyers get together to rap about the pleasures of a really good polish. </p> <p>Tania Carpenter, 35, understands what they're talking about. 'For me housework has always been a creative act. It's about contributing my labour and my know-how in order to make a calm, nurturing space for my family.' Friends think that Carpenter, who works 12-hour days in marketing for a blue-chip company, is crazy. 'They ask me why I don't hire a cleaner like everyone else. But they're missing the point. I don't see housework as some chore to be got through as quickly as possible, or palmed off on someone else. It's more than my hobby, it's a kind of therapy. If I didn't do it I'd be a less fulfilled person.' </p> <p>Carpenter isn't the only British woman yearning to return to a time when housework was difficult, dirty and even dangerous. One Sunday supplement recently ran a piece telling you where to buy Brasso. Another magazine did a feature on proper yellow dusters and loose-weave cotton cloths (neither of which work as nicely as a synthetic, sky-blue J-cloth). Posh shops and high-street retailers alike are full of great hunks of white laundry soap which look like you should be scrubbing your clothes down by the river's edge, instead of using a Hotpoint. They also do scented waters in which to rinse your bed linen (if you have a polyester-mix duvet cover then you're missing the point completely). </p> <p>But particularly odd is the way that Cheryl Mendelson chooses to present her own experience in the introduction to the book. She characterises her love of hard domestic slog as a 'secret passion' which she has previously felt too ashamed to share. Writing Home Comforts, she says, has been a way of outing herself as the queen of clean. This suggests that, first, Mendelson has some pretty strange friends if she honestly thought they might dump her when they discovered that her immaculate apartment was all her own work. But second, and more serious, is her implication that this 'secret' self is also her true one. The way Mendelson frames it, her PhD, the job at Columbia, the Harvard law degree are nothing more than a dutiful nod towards inauthentic social norms. Housework, by contrast, brings her 'the increasingly rare freedom to engage in unalienated, honourable work'. The idea that tidying up after other people for little thanks and no money is less alienating than being paid plenty for your quick legal brain seems odd. Also worrying is the fashionable Darwinian implication that no matter how much you tinker with social formations (giving a girl a good education), biological imperatives will prevail. And, in Mendelson's case, those imperatives will always show themselves in knowing the right way to fold a sheet. </p> <p>The fact is that fantasising about a time when a girl's best friend was her mangle only makes sense if you reserve the right to use a tumbler dryer when you're pressed for time. Opting for Sunlight soap (you can still get it if you know where to look) is fun only if you've consciously rejected the idea of using Persil tablets, at least for today. A dingy cotton cloth is bearable when you know you can always go over the surface again with a disposable, disinfected household wipe. The woman in Channel 4's documentary The 1900 House didn't have the choice, and so was famously reduced to tears. Hot water which comes and goes as it pleases, dust which sulks in corners and towelling sanitary towels which scratch and smell - these are just a few of the things which the new domestics forget to tell you about housekeeping the old-fashioned way. </p> <p>The fantasy of the new domesticity is beguiling because it suggests a time when it was possible to spend your time doing one thing well. A time when it really was feasible to dedicate Mondays to washing, Tuesdays to odd jobs and know that the plan would hold because you weren't trying to run a career on the side. Skidding home from work to meet the childminder's deadline before organising some sort of meal for everyone is hardly conducive to making sure that the tops of your books are properly vacuumed (Mendelson, page 612). The new domesticity implies too that you have someone to support you financially while you fold and smooth and pat. In reality, of course, it would not be fun, as all those numb, raging women who talked to Betty Friedan for The Feminine Mystique would tell you.

      "bodyText": "In the dying hours of the late Late Review, Tony Parsons declared that there was no sight more erotic than Annette Bening vacuuming furiously in her slip in American Beauty . It doesn't matter that the scene is heavily ironic - far from being a compliant housewife, Bening is a shrewish estate agent desperately primping one of her properties - Parsons's response suggests that for many men there's always been something singularly satisfying about a sexy woman getting down to some hard domestic graft. Far stranger is the growing band of woman who declare themselves, if not exactly turned on, then certainly deeply pleasured by the idea of keeping house. More specifically, keeping house with as much bother as possible. Creating a place where you can turn dinner guests loose without worrying that they'll stumble across evidence of your threat to public health is nice, but that isn't the point. The new domestics actually enjoy the process of creating order out of chaos, and to prove it they do it with as much inconvenience to themselves as possible.

The group has agreed that decisions can be taken without everybody having to be there. </p> <p>Members of the Kew Giving Circle have now written to charities which have been sending them appeal letters, asking to be taken off the mailing lists. </p> <p>According to Weleminsky, most charities have responded positively to this request. 'We feel better for not being emotionally targeted by a multitude of charities, and we hope less of our donation will be spent on further fundraising and more on the real cause,' she says. </p> <p>The experience in Kew suggests that, over all, the members of the giving circle are donating more of their money to good causes. </p> <p>Weleminsky believes that the Kew Giving Circle is an idea with potential for people in other areas, and is offering advice to others thinking of establishing their own groups. </p> <p> Judy Weleminsky can be contacted on 020 8876 5087 or judywele@aol.com.</p>",

According to Weleminsky, most charities have responded positively to this request. 'We feel better for not being emotionally targeted by a multitude of charities, and we hope less of our donation will be spent on further fundraising and more on the real cause,' she says. The experience in Kew suggests that, over all, the members of the giving circle are donating more of their money to good causes. Weleminsky believes that the Kew Giving Circle is an idea with potential for people in other areas, and is offering advice to others thinking of establishing their own groups. Judy Weleminsky can be contacted on 020 8876 5087 or judywele@aol.com.",

      "body": "<b>Deborah Morris</b> <br> We are in Wood Green Crown Court, defending in what amounts to a neighbours dispute. It is serious because our client, who is one of a family of Greeks living in north London, stands to lose not only his liberty but his home if he is found guilty. <p>It's a complicated case and the whole family is charged on 15 counts ranging from threats to kill through to putting people in fear of violence and criminal damage. The accusations come from the next-door neighbours, originally an East End family. This is not in any way a racial trial, but is one of those tragedies in which no one will be the winner. The case has already been in court for four and a half weeks.</p> <p>Jonathan Goodman, who acts as my 'noting' junior in this case and is consequently being paid a fee for it, is one of the most gifted pupils I have worked with. Like me, he came late to the law, having worked in commerce in the Midlands. He's 44 now, but was a lay magistrate for five years before deciding to study law at Luton University where he won a first class LLB (Hons) in two years, so he knows what he's doing. This is a complicated trial with a number of accusations and video evidence, and I need his help.</p> <p>I am deputy head of chambers at Number One Grays Inn Square, where Jonathan has been a pupil since last October. His pupilage will last 12 months of which he has already spent six as a student taking no active part in court proceedings. Now, he is able to appear in court in his own right.</p> <p>Work during the trial is intense and we are in each other's company for five days every week. As luck would have it, we are happy in each other's company; in fact, he's taking me out to dinner tonight. He is specialising in crime and criminal fraud, which means that his knowledge and experience is already of great help. </p> <p>I am meticulous about preparation and, in the course of a trial, Jonathan will do much of the legal research for me. If, for instance, it is a complicated and difficult fraud, he will work on the chronology of the witness statements and give me an outline, in a simplified form, of who said what and when. When I am cross-examining a witness and Jonathan feels that I have forgotten to make a point, he will make a note and pass it across.</p> <p>I love my job, but I came to the law late. I am 45-years-old and was called to the Bar when I was 34, after starting my career as a model, then as a teacher in a comprehensive and finally as an accountant. Virtually all my Bar work is as a defence advocate, but I only work in the London Crown Courts, such as Snaresbrook, Wood Green, Middlesex Crown Court, The Old Bailey and Southwark, because I have two small children and I feel that they have a right to see their mother in the evening.</p> <p>One of the problems facing all barristers is the difficulties of juggling their time. Trials tend to run on for all sorts of reasons; a juror can be taken ill, or a defendant can fail to turn up. The jury has just retired in this case so, although they have 15 counts to consider, we expect to finish by the beginning of next week at the latest. In fact, I have a rape case starting at Middlesex Crown Court on Monday and I also have a 'Pleas and Directions' at Snaresbrook on the same day.

      "bodyText": "Deborah Morris We are in Wood Green Crown Court, defending in what amounts to a neighbours dispute. It is serious because our client, who is one of a family of Greeks living in north London, stands to lose not only his liberty but his home if he is found guilty. It's a complicated case and the whole family is charged on 15 counts ranging from threats to kill through to putting people in fear of violence and criminal damage. The accusations come from the next-door neighbours, originally an East End family. This is not in any way a racial trial, but is one of those tragedies in which no one will be the winner. The case has already been in court for four and a half weeks. Jonathan Goodman, who acts as my 'noting' junior in this case and is consequently being paid a fee for it, is one of the most gifted pupils I have worked with. Like me, he came late to the law, having worked in commerce in the Midlands. He's 44 now, but was a lay magistrate for five years before deciding to study law at Luton University where he won a first class LLB (Hons) in two years, so he knows what he's doing. This is a complicated trial with a number of accusations and video evidence, and I need his help. I am deputy head of chambers at Number One Grays Inn Square, where Jonathan has been a pupil since last October. His pupilage will last 12 months of which he has already spent six as a student taking no active part in court proceedings. Now, he is able to appear in court in his own right. Work during the trial is intense and we are in each other's company for five days every week. As luck would have it, we are happy in each other's company; in fact, he's taking me out to dinner tonight. He is specialising in crime and criminal fraud, which means that his knowledge and experience is already of great help. I am meticulous about preparation and, in the course of a trial, Jonathan will do much of the legal research for me. If, for instance, it is a complicated and difficult fraud, he will work on the chronology of the witness statements and give me an outline, in a simplified form, of who said what and when. When I am cross-examining a witness and Jonathan feels that I have forgotten to make a point, he will make a note and pass it across. I love my job, but I came to the law late. I am 45-years-old and was called to the Bar when I was 34, after starting my career as a model, then as a teacher in a comprehensive and finally as an accountant. Virtually all my Bar work is as a defence advocate, but I only work in the London Crown Courts, such as Snaresbrook, Wood Green, Middlesex Crown Court, The Old Bailey and Southwark, because I have two small children and I feel that they have a right to see their mother in the evening. One of the problems facing all barristers is the difficulties of juggling their time. Trials tend to run on for all sorts of reasons; a juror can be taken ill, or a defendant can fail to turn up. The jury has just retired in this case so, although they have 15 counts to consider, we expect to finish by the beginning of next week at the latest. In fact, I have a rape case starting at Middlesex Crown Court on Monday and I also have a 'Pleas and Directions' at Snaresbrook on the same day. This is when the judge will hear pleas, agree witnesses, fix the date of a trial and any preliminary issues of law will be raised. I have briefed Jonathan to handle this for me and am more than happy for him to do it. I know him well enough to be happy with delegating this sort of work to him. Jonathan Goodman I am now more than half way through my pupilage and this is one of the first criminal trials at which I have been able to take an active part.

Not over the ugly building site which is all that is visible of the expensive Scottish parliament fiasco, but across the road in the plush new offices of the Scotsman newspaper. </p> <p>Just weeks before a vital and long-awaited relaunch, the traditional champion of liberalism north of the border is in turmoil. The paper was rocked to its foundations last week with the shock announcement that its new editor, Tim Luckhurst, is taking long-term sick leave - suffering from high blood pressure and severe stress. </p> <p>No wonder. In the two months since the departure of Luckhurst's predecessor, Alan Ruddock, the paper has been engaged in near-permanent bloodletting. The deputy editor has gone, the night editor has gone, and the news editor has gone, as have the features editor and much of the business and reporting staff. Then on Friday associate editor Dean Nelson resigned, only three months after joining the paper from the Observer. </p> <p> And there may be more bad news around the corner. Well-informed sources are suggesting that Luckhurst will not be returning to his new job. 'You have to ask whether it's worth your health, and the answer is: it's not,' remarked one insider. </p> <p>One effect of the current fallout has been to reignite criticism of Andrew Neil, the combative publisher of the Scotsman and its sister paper Scotland on Sunday. More fundamentally, the strife in Holyrood comes just as the Scottish newspaper market is going ballistic. </p> <p>Since Neil was put in to oversee the Scotsman by the Barclay brothers in 1996, sales have continued to bump disappointingly around the 80,000 mark, and there have been constant tales of him interfering in the editorial direction - of furious phone calls from London berating executives. </p> <p>'People get overexcited about Andrew Neil's politics,' a former senior executive told The Observer . 'But it's his incompetence as a manager that's the problem. He doesn't know how to deal with people; he doesn't know how to build a strategy to make a paper successful. In my opinion, he is a one-trick pony. Nothing he has touched since he left the Sunday Times has worked. The more you change people around - the more flux there is - the less chance you have of success.' </p> <p>Ruddock left in February after he and his publisher had clashed over the direction of the paper. Ruddock envisaged it becoming a national newspaper for Scotland. Neil, however, is determined that it should become an international broadsheet which just happens to be based north of the border. </p> <p>That is where the much-heralded relaunch comes in. Backed by a multi-million pound promotion, the expanded Scotsman will have beefed-up news and features coverage plus a Guardian G2- style tabloid - imaginatively titled S2. Luckhurst, Ruddock's deputy, was made acting editor, to see through the changes. </p> <p>But the big surprise was the appointment of Rebecca Hardy as joint deputy editor in charge of S2. Until she got the call from Neil, she had been senior feature writer at the Daily Mail, and had little editing experience. Now she is running the Scotsman . 'Don't underestimate Rebecca,' said one well-placed supporter. 'She'll be in there to prove her self, and I wouldn't be surprised if she had her eye on the editor's job.' </p> <p>Gathering staff together last week, she announced her intention to make the paper 'great again'. Neither Neil nor Hardy was available for comment last week, but a spokesman for the Scotsman's London PR agency denied rumours that Luckhurst would not be returning to work. He added: 'There have been a number of departures. The Scotsman is undergoing a radical replanning. Changes in personnel are inevitable because the paper is moving forward, developing its journalism and improving its coverage for readers.' </p> <p>The Scotsman has not been helped by the fact that its troubles come just as the Scottish newspaper market is set to become even more competitive with the launch by Swedish group Bonnier of the first new daily for over a century. Focusing on business and politics, its editor will be John Penman, a former executive at the Scotsman and the Daily Record. The arrival of the new paper has had a painful effect on the Scotsman . Perhaps the biggest blow before last week's developments was the resignation of widely admired deputy editor Richard Neville, who left to join his old colleague Penman. Almost the entire business desk and the core of the reporting team have followed him. </p> <p>Neville insists the decision to move was a positive one. 'I never thought in my career that there would ever be another daily paper launched in Scotland. But the timing is right, and it was a really simple decision to make.' </p> <p>Neville says the new paper will be a supplementary read, offering upmarket business readers deeper coverage to complement what is already on offer. But few executives in Edinburgh doubt that it will further damage the struggling Scotsman . </p> <p>That is not Neil's only headache. Scotland on Sunday is locked in a fierce and vitriolic battle with the Glasgow-based Sunday Herald, launched 14 months ago by the Scottish Media Group, owner of the Herald newspaper and Scottish and Grampian television stations. Its official sales hover around 50,000 compared with the 110,000 regularly achieved by its Edinburgh rival, but under the direction of Andrew Jaspan, former editor of Scotland on Sunday and The Observer, it has mounted a no-holds-barred campaign to pinch readers which culminated last weekend in a 10p price offer. SoS, in a move which smacked of panic, immediately did likewise. </p> <p>Early unofficial figures say sales went up to 135,000, while the Sunday Herald's almost doubled to 95,000 copies. </p> <p>'A lot of our readers who would previously not have been tempted to buy the Sunday Herald will have given it a go when they saw they could get our paper for 10p,' said Kevin McKenna, SoS deputy editor. 'We think that somebody will soon pull the plug on the Sunday Herald . If you look at its news pages, you can see that there is no advertising, no commercial activity at all.' </p> <p>But Jaspan remains defiant. 'Once people start looking at the paper, they enjoy it. We just have to get them to try it. SoS are getting very upset about this, but it is 12 years old, and we are just trying to get up to speed. We will resort to anything we can.' </p> <p>The turmoil looks set to continue.</p>",

Regulators, government, MPs, environmentalists, even customers, have poured scorn on its safety, management, environmental record and accounting practices. </p> <p>Three reports by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the industry watchdog, into operations at BNFL's Sellafield plant in Cumbria were published in February. They could scarcely have been more damning. </p> <p>One, written after a two-week inspection of Sellafield last September, found 'a lack of a high-quality safety management systems across the site' and 'insufficient resources to implement even the existing safety management system'. </p> <p>During that inspection a major scandal broke at Sellafield. Staff at a demonstration facility for production of an experimental mixed plutonium and uranium fuel (MOX) were exposed as falsifying data. The NII began a second investigation. </p> <p>Its report damned Sellafield a second time. 'In a plant with the proper safety culture, the events discussed in this report could not have happened,' it said. </p> <p>But the NII was not alone. The Environment Agency pitched in. Its criticisms were not focused simply on Sellafield; they included its fuel manufacturing plant at Springfields as well as some of its ageing Magnox power stations. </p> <p>As if all this were not enough, the politicians had their penn'orth too. Martin O'Neill, chairman of the influential commons Trade and Industry Select Committee, criticised BNFL's accounts for being at best unclear. It also said the company treated the Government and the public with 'disdain'. </p> <p>Collum must have wondered what had hit him. His City background saw him appointed last autumn to steer the company through the planned public-private partnership (PPP) - effectively a part privatisation. </p> <p>No sooner had he arrived than the organisation began disintegrating around him. In the wake of the NII reports, the Government put off the PPP. Collum started fighting back days after those reports. He replaced BNFL's chief executive John Taylor with Askew, a respected utility boss. </p> <p>Askew says that when he arrived he could not work out how Sellafield operated. 'I am used to organisations where there is very clear accountability,' he said. 'I didn't find that. There were people running parts of it with different safety systems in different parts of the site. I just said: why isn't one person running it?' </p> <p>On Tuesday, Collum and Askew presented a plan aimed at overhauling safety and management. A freeze on job cuts was announced. Four clear business groups were set out: fuel manufacturing; electricity generation at Magnox power stations; spent fuel management including reprocessing; and decommissioning. </p> <p>There was a clear-out of all non-executive directors, along with half the executive board, including finance director Ross Chiese and safety director David Coulston. </p> <p>Askew says the plan has to be implemented within 18 months if the company is to survive. He is confident. </p> <p>But at its core is a tension that may well undermine that confidence. On the one hand, Collum and Askew have to prove that BNFL is safe. On the other, they have to bring the PPP back on track by the end of 2002. They maintain the two are not mutually exclusive. Collum says: 'The disciplines of the PPP were making people understand that some of the changes had got to happen.' </p> <p>But there are bound to be controversies. For example, the NII criticised BNFL for being 'underresourced' and pointed to stretched manpower. </p> <p>Askew says that although employment levels will be frozen now for safety reasons, jobs will go at privatisation: 'When you take a business from the public sector to the private, you can do it with fewer people.' </p> <p>So the question is, can safety and commercialisation be reconciled? Many believe they cannot. </p> <p>Again, concerns focus on Sellafield's reprocessing oper ations. Reprocessing involves taking spent uranium fuel and breaking it down into reprocessed uranium, plutonium and nuclear waste. In theory, the uranium can be reused in reactors, or mixed with the plutonium in MOX fuel. Its commercial viability has never been clear. Neither has it been safe - the Sellafield site has been linked with safety scares ever since it was opened in 1953 (see right). </p> <p>BNFL has been playing down the role of reprocessing in its business model for some time. Askew says it currently represents between 20 and 25 per cent of group revenue - and that could fall as other parts of the business, such as decommissioning, grow. Collum said recently that the company may abandon reprocessing in future. But if it wants to be privatised within 18 months it cannot abandon reprocessing now. In short, the desire to privatise BNFL could prolong the problem which lies at its heart. </p> <p>Professor William Walker, author of a book on BNFL and 'political entrapment', says: 'They are not addressing the policy problem - why is it reprocessing at all? Reprocessing is not a precondition for privatisation; it is a hindrance.' </p> <p>The crucial element at the centre of all decision-making is one of the most hazardous substances known to man - plutonium. Plutonium is created when uranium is burnt in a reactor. In the Forties, its use, and its value, was primarily military. Britain's civil reprocessing programme - and BNFL itself - was a spin-off. Nevertheless, a complex case for civil reprocessing was developed in the Fifties and Sixties. </p> <p>Sellafield began reprocessing fuel from the 11 first-generation Magnox power stations at a plant built in the Sixties called B205. A \u00a32.85 billion second-generation plant called Thorp, which became operational from 1994, followed. Whether reprocessing is commercial has been contentious ever since. The most basic problem was that the price of uranium crashed from $45 dollars a pound in 1978 to $10 a pound in 1999. In addition, nuclear weapons programmes slowed, creating the prospect of dangerous and worthless plutonium stockpiles. A commercial value for the deadly substance had to be found to sustain the reprocessing industry. </p> <p>The answer was a generation of plutonium-burning 'fast-breeder reactors' (FBRs) to generate electricity. These were designed in the Seventies and Eighties in Britain, the US, France, Russia and Japan. They were a failure. </p> <p>Gordon MacKerron, a nuclear economist at Sussex University, says: 'The only justification for FBRs was the uranium price remaining high to justify high building costs compared with conventional reactors.' </p> <p>The next suggested solution to the plutonium problem was as MOX fuel for use in conventional reactors. BNFL has built several MOX plants at Sellafield: the latest cost \u00a3300 million. </p> <p>MOX today faces similar threats. Fresh uranium fuel is now much cheaper. Last year a House of Lords Science and Technology Committee report recommended that non-military plutonium be considered as waste. The Government is considering its response. </p> <p>The stakes are high -the Government response will effectively decide whether the economic case for reprocessing is maintained. </p> <p>MacKerron argues that neither reprocessing nor MOX manufacture can form part of the company's commercial future, and should be abandoned. </p> <p>Potential customers have contracted for only 6.7 per cent of the MOX plant capacity - well below the break-even point. </p> <p>On top of this comes the falsification scandal, which has undermined confidence among vital customers and threatened future sales. </p> <p>The future of MOX impacts on Thorp, which is generating hazardous separated plutonium all the time. If MOX fails, the justification for plutonium separation at Thorp is weakened. </p> <p>Thorp's difficulty is that there is no real market for its products - only experimental amounts of its output have been used. Its case rests on contracts for reprocessing, which have given the plant a \u00a312bn order book. </p> <p>Many of these contracts were agreed in the Seventies and Eighties with UK and foreign utilities. Most were 'cost plus', allowing BNFL to make a margin however much the work cost. More importantly, two-thirds of the \u00a32.85bn cost of building Thorp was financed from upfront payments from these contracts. </p> <p>Thorp is currently fully booked. When it was commissioned, BNFL estimated profits averaging \u00a350m a year until 2004. But the 2004-2114 period looks dicey - only half of capacity is filled, and many of these deals are with British Energy in the form of options to reprocess or store spent fuel. BE has said recently said it is moving against reprocessing in favour of storage. </p> <p>In addition, says MacKerron, utilities in Germany and Japan have realised that storage is a lot cheaper. </p> <p>As well as reprocessing issues, the ageing Magnox stations are contributing greatly to BNFL's problems. Magnox contributed a \u00a334m loss in the three months of 1998 for which it was included in the group. Indeed, MacKerron believes BNFL makes money only from managing massive funds it has inherited from historical sources. He points out that the company made a \u00a362m loss last year on 'continuing operations'. </p> <p>Part of these funds are upfront Thorp payments. But they also include \u00a32.6bn raised through a nuclear levy paid by the public on their fuel bills in the Eighties and Nineties - intended for Magnox decommissioning. </p> <p>In addition, \u00a33.7bn of future decommissioning costs will come from a special 'Secretary of State's Undertaking' - effectively an IOU from the Government spanning 108 years from 2008, when facilities will be decommissioned. </p> <p>BNFL is already claiming part of this in its accounts - it included a \u00a3249m credit in its figures last year, although it did not receive a penny from the Treasury. Collum emphasises that this is legitimate accounting practice. </p> <p>Calculating the costs of dismantling nuclear plants over coming decades is hideously complex, but it is vital to the commercial future because anyone buying in will have to evaluate the risks. The Magnox stations brought with them huge liabilities which contribute some \u00a38bn of the calculated \u00a313bn total. </p> <p>BNFL claims it has covered 89 per cent of these. It has, for example, a \u00a33.9bn Nuclear Liabilities Investment Portfolio (NLIP), and the Government's \u00a33.7bn IOU. But the NLIP's status after a privatisation would be unclear. And whether the Government's IOU is paid will depend on the goodwill of at least 21 different governments over the 108-year decommissioning period. </p> <p>MacKerron is concerned about the ability of a company that is essentially lossmaking to fund liabilities which are difficult to quantify, over a period which is hard to conceive. This problem will only increase if BNFL is privatised. </p> <p>For William Walker, this is fundamental. The story of reprocessing at BNFL is one of 'political entrapment', where military/commercial decisions taken in the years after the war set in train events which have forced governments to press on with the programme despite evidence indicating it was neither economic nor safe. </p> <p>As time has passed, the tensions between the company and the institutions which surround it have simply grown - culminating in the Sellafield debacle. </p> <p>Walker believes the affair could provide a chance for a real fresh start. But the Government's insistence on the PPP and statements of strong support for reprocessing from the Prime Minster in parliament gives him cause to doubt. </p> <p>'Why is it that Tony Blair, the arch moderniser, wishes to perpetuate the failed policies of the past?' he asks. </p> <p>In fact Blair has long been strongly committed to Sellafield. On a visit there in 1989 he underlined 'the absolute commitment of the Labour Party to Sellafield, and to reassure the workforce that jobs here are entirely safe.' </p> <p>Blair could simply be uncharacteristically stuck in his ways over BNFL. Or he could be the latest victim of entrapment. But if reprocessing and the PPP go ahead, the evidence is that he will be passing on the problems of today to his successor. </p> <p>And then this year's nuclear crisis may be only the beginning... </p> <p><strong>Unlimited liability dates from way back</strong><br> Sellafield, formerly known as Windscale, has a history of problems dating back to its creation in the 1940s.

      "body": "<b> Ever since he was little</b> my son has been prone to serious temper tantrums. He is now nine years old and has been getting into fights at school. He also fights with me at home - cursing and hitting - but cannot say what it is that triggers his rages. His father and I do not live together but he has a violent temper too. The anger is so bad it is spoiling our lives. How can a parent help an angry child? <p><b> J.M. </b>of South London</p> <p>Temper tantrums are a common phenomenon in young children but the term, implying as it does self-limiting juvenility, is not appropriate for a boy of nine. These outbursts usually appear at the age of two, gradually fade out at four, and occur because the child's motivation and desires outstrip his motor capacity and co-ordination; they are therefore an expression of frustration. Your observation about his father is relevant because this behaviour pattern is almost certainly inherited. It is logical to try to understand the cause so that you can modify the problem. Triggers which spark off your son's rages are probably irrelevant; the defect lies within his psychological make-up, and is therefore difficult to reach and influence. </p> <p>Aggression is a vital inherited characteristic in an intensely competitive world. It is expected that everyone will have a measure of pugnaciousness in his/her constitution, but most people cope by compartmentalising or sublimating. Not surprisingly many men who have reached highly influential positions have a history, like your son, of a short fuse and a red-hot temper going back to childhood.</p> <p>Accept that your son has a personality problem which will never be eradicated, but which he can learn to control and even to channel into creative conduits.

      "bodyText": "Ever since he was little my son has been prone to serious temper tantrums. He is now nine years old and has been getting into fights at school. He also fights with me at home - cursing and hitting - but cannot say what it is that triggers his rages. His father and I do not live together but he has a violent temper too. The anger is so bad it is spoiling our lives. How can a parent help an angry child? J.M. of South London Temper tantrums are a common phenomenon in young children but the term, implying as it does self-limiting juvenility, is not appropriate for a boy of nine. These outbursts usually appear at the age of two, gradually fade out at four, and occur because the child's motivation and desires outstrip his motor capacity and co-ordination; they are therefore an expression of frustration. Your observation about his father is relevant because this behaviour pattern is almost certainly inherited. It is logical to try to understand the cause so that you can modify the problem. Triggers which spark off your son's rages are probably irrelevant; the defect lies within his psychological make-up, and is therefore difficult to reach and influence. Aggression is a vital inherited characteristic in an intensely competitive world. It is expected that everyone will have a measure of pugnaciousness in his/her constitution, but most people cope by compartmentalising or sublimating. Not surprisingly many men who have reached highly influential positions have a history, like your son, of a short fuse and a red-hot temper going back to childhood. Accept that your son has a personality problem which will never be eradicated, but which he can learn to control and even to channel into creative conduits. Professional help is unavailable for this type of disorder, but your input will certainly be influential and perhaps his father's even more so. You need to engage the boy in frank and serious analysis of his turbulence when he is calm. He should come face to face with the potential destructiveness of his nature, of its unacceptability, particularly of the hurt and misery he causes you. If at all possible you should take a video of him in one of these furies, then make him watch. Never let him achieve any reward from his violence, getting his own way or escaping from obligations, and manipulating adults. But praise him when he does control himself. Talk with his school teachers and find out what his strengths are and maximise his chance to engage in these. Next week's dilemma is from L.B. of Eastbourne My only son left his wife of eight years for another woman who he will soon marry. I had always been close to my daughter-in-law.

So, filled with the joys of Finsbury Park traffic, and thrilled with my vehicle's legendary 25ft turning circle, I did a U-turn into oncoming traffic. You would have, too, if you'd been there, behind the wheel of a TX1, the newest London cab, a motor for a profession of motormouths. I was a King of the Road for the day. I was a member of the brotherhood. Other taxis let me through at junctions, cabbies smiled back\u0085 and a little old lady in a Fiesta cut me right up, I can tell you. Right across the front of me, no kidding, knew just what she was doing, too, only pretended she wasn't looking - Fiesta drivers, eh?</p> <p>Like a real would-be cabbie, I was starting at the very beginning, the very place where ordinary men and women turn into Knowledge Boys and Girls. As Arthur's knights began their quest for the Grail by mounting their steeds in the grounds of Camelot, so taxi drivers all start out on the quest for the 'badge' at the otherwise obscure north London junction where Green Lanes crosses Seven Sisters Road.</p> <p>It's the kick-off point for the first route in the 'blue book', the collection of 'runs' a London cabbie must memorise to get a licence - see Jack Rosenthal's The Knowledge for the full horrors of this trial. Known as 'Manor House to Gibson Square', this first run slices through the three miles or so of inner London you can't easily cross by bus or tube. Cutting across the fault lines of the modern city, it starts by a littery park and finishes in a literary Georgian square.</p> <p>Bear right into Petherton Road. That was the next instruction given to me by a cabbie of my acquaintance. By name, residence and idiosyncracy of enthusiasms, he's typical of the fraternity - Barry from Loughton, Essex, specialist subjects Pilates and reflexology. 'Love it. Absolutely love it,' said Barry of his new TX1. He bought it last autumn and can't find a thing bad to say about it - just don't get him started on the jerk who chucked up on its carpet.</p> <p>Right St Paul's Road. The TX1, which has been around since 1997, is the latest in an almost apostolic succession of dedicated London taxis, made by London Taxis International, whose only competitor is the slightly larger, more angular and less popular MetroCab. Before the TX1 was the Fairway, a development of the 1958-vintage FX4 - this was the classic black cab shape, with its big bonnet and box-like passenger compartment. Before that was the FX3 - the one with no front left door, as used in Carry On Cabbie . Mann &amp; Overton, the company which leant me the vehicle, goes back even further than that. Its dealt exclusively in cabs since 1889 and its north London showroom shifts 2,000 new and secondhand taxis a year.</p> <p>Everywhere else in the taxi world, anything vehicular goes. London's Public Carriage Office has none of that. Its demands have never been less than stringent and comprehensive. The latest requirements focus on public transport's two major current health and safety issues - emissions and the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). So the TX1 retains some of its predecessors' beloved profile, but is a little taller and has doors that are 44 per cent wider. Both changes were to accommodate wheelchairs, but are a boon for all of us.</p> <p>Comply Highbury Corner. Swinging on to the roundabout, the TX1 handles far more like a family saloon than you'd expect. The steering is clean, though still a little firm to those of us who don't drive old trucks for a living. The diesel engine delivers the power smoothly. The automatic gearbox does just what it's meant to. The power brakes do what they're meant to, though you do have to step on them in good time - 2 tonnes takes some stopping. And the cupholder by your left shoulder doesn't slop the drink around - though it's as inconvenient a location as you could imagine. 'Not up to car comfort and build yet,' said Nick Tim Hughes of Mann &amp; Overton.</p> <p>Leave by Upper Street. 'Comfortable,' said my fare - well, my wife actually. If I'd plied for hire, I'd have had a library - shelves, date stamps and all - thrown at me. Older London cabs were even less pleasant for the passengers than they were for the drivers. They rattled, they shook, they juddered at the lights, they had heating systems which seemed to have only two settings - blowtorch and 'Open, the window, guv'. Even then, the window would slither closed all by itself. Now the passenger has two vanity mirrors, two reading lights and a heater which actually does what it's told.</p> <p>Right Barnsbury Street. Like a lot of drivers, Barry no longer has a second car. When he and his best girl Trudy step out, it's in his top-of-the-range cab, complete with CD player. Still, she knew what she was getting - they met when he picked her up as a 'fare' in the City.</p> <p>Left Milner Square. It's true that a TX1 would make an excellent town runaround - Stephen Fry has one, it seems, and so does the Lord Mayor of London. The driving position is high, with clear views all round, except immediately behind - though it's noisier and rattlier in the cab than in the passenger compartment. The tight turning circle means it is almost laughably manoeuvrable - more like being on the dodgems than the road. And its 2 tonnes and steel chassis are fantastic insurance in crashes.</p> <p>Leave by Milner Place. But there's no boot room. It's all taken up by the spare tyre and wheelchair access ramps - mandatory on all London taxis since 1 January, which is why many older cabs are heading to the secondhand market and provincial cities. The TX1 is getting about a bit, too. Of the 7,000 on the road, just 4,000 are in London. Its wheelchair accessibility could well make it an international success.</p> <p>Gibson Square Facing. Right, boss that'll be \u00a328,990. Plus \u00a3560 for the Maldives Blue finish - metallic paint never comes cheap. Another \u00a340 for the headrest, and \u00a3549 for the Alpine radio and CD package. Call it \u00a330,000. Have I got change for a \u00a320? You must be joking.</p>",

Neither lot number one, licences for third-generation mobile phone services, nor lot number two, the rights to televise Premiership football, could be described as antique, fine art, or rock star memorabilia. </p> <p>The commissions from these multi-billion pound deals could, however, warrant the two lots a place under the hammer at the New Bond Street auction house. </p> <p>But auctions like these, rather than lining the pockets of traditional auction houses, are providing work for an army of mathematical economists and game theorists. </p> <p>Auction theory, as this complex amalgam of microeconomics is known, has a wide application. It is relevant to the \u00a322 billion battle for control of mobile phones. BSkyB's bid to take control of Manchester United was blocked, in part, because of the insights of auction theory. Sales of gold and electricity, and the increasing use of the Internet for procurement of business supplies, have also brought the theory back to the fore. </p> <p>Essentially auctions are an efficient method of distributing a scarce resource: by collecting all the possible bidders, an auction should get the maximum price from the most eager bidder. In a commercial auction, bids indicate the amount of profit each bidder expects to make. </p> <p>So, although much is said about the \u00a322bn mobile phone auction amounting to a tax on technology, access to this portion of the airwaves offers a licence to print money. Auction theory says it would be 'economically inefficient' to hand these licences - or, more specifically, these tranches of the electromagnetic spectrum - over to selected companies for a low price in a beauty contest. </p> <p>'Well-run auctions assign rights to the bidders who are willing to pay most - not the party with the most political influence,' says Professor Paul Milgrom of Stanford University. He designed the mechanism used by the Federal Communications Commission for the first 'spectrum auction' in America in 1994. The auction of next-generation mobile phone licences in Britain is a modified version of those auctions. </p> <p>The essentials remain the same regardless of the auction: bids are the lowest a firm believes will secure the lot. A bidder has to make a careful analysis of what the other bidders may do, which in turn will be dependent to some degree on what they think he may bid. This is the realm of game theory. </p> <p>It has identified two main problems with the auction process. When all the bidders for a licence can only secure the same profits, any victor in an auction faces the 'winner's curse'. The winner is likely to be the bidder most optimistic about potential profits. In many circumstances it will have paid over the odds and is really a loser. At worst this can lead to bankruptcy. </p> <p>In an ascending bid auction this problem is lessened. Throughout the auction, bidders reveal more and more information about how they value a contract or licence, and learn from each other's reactions. Game theorists employed by telecoms companies will have played out this high-stakes poker game already. Using advanced computer models they will have worked through every possible permutation of response from each bidder. </p> <p>However, these auctions leave the door open to a second problem - collusion between bidders. </p> <p>Professor Paul Klemperer of Oxford University, the economic theorist behind the current next-generation mobile auctions, says auctions in Germany last year offering extra capacity for conventional mobile phones illustrate this point. </p> <p>Mannesmann bid a low price for half the licences and an even lower price for the other half. Though no discussions had taken place, the structure of their bid meant the other bidder, T-mobil, only needed to raise the bid on half the licences slightly. The result was that after two rounds of bidding each of the bidders had half the licences for the same low price. </p> <p>A 'second-price' auction in New Zealand in 1990 (see box) enabled one bidder to pick up the rights to a tranche of the mobile phone spectrum for just NZ$6. </p> <p>In America there have been instances of bidders using the final four numbers of their multi-million dollar bids to signal to each other which telephone code area they want to buy. </p> <p>In a separate case, the US Justice Department was brought in to investigate possible collusion in a 1997 auction expected to raise almost $2bn that raised less than $14 million. </p> <p>The use of these auctions has clearly not been an unmitigated success. 'It's a case of horses for courses,' says Klemperer. 'There are many different methods of auctioning and which is best is sensitive to the specific details of the market.' </p> <p>But his theories have also been applied to other, seemingly unrelated areas. In Britain a report by the Competition Commission recommending that BSkyB's takeover of Man Utd should be blocked was rooted in Klem perer's analysis of 'toehold effects' in bidding situations. </p> <p>Put simply, if BSkyB bought Man Utd, any TV rights deal would offer the same potential profit to both companies. Imagine that BSkyB owned United and was bidding against Ondigital for Premiership rights. If Ondigital were to win, 7 per cent of its bid would go to BSkyB. Thus, whether it wins the rights or not, BSkyB has an incentive to push up the bidding that much more aggressively. This exaggerates the winner's curse for OnDigital; in effect, it has to back off the bidding more than BSkyB. </p> <p>The 'toehold' affects both sides of the bidding equation, setting off a vicious circle for OnDigital and a virtuous circle for BSkyB. Ondigital, knowing that BSkyB can bid more aggressively, will scale back its bidding. BSkyB will always win the rights in an auction like this. </p> <p>While BSkyB was not able to take over Man Utd, it has taken strategic 9.9 per cent stakes in four Premiership clubs. It still has a toehold, but this time one shared across several different clubs rather than concentrated on one. </p> <p>The last negotiation for Premiership rights had a gaping flaw. Awarding BSkyB the right to match any rival offer may have been seen as a clever way to top any final bid for rights, but Klemperer says: 'Giving a bidder the right to match is not a costless exchange, since there is no reason to bid the price up in the first instance.' So knowing that it could always match any offer, BSkyB never pushed up the bid price. </p> <p>Even the forthcoming Pre miership auction seems questionable, given the insights of auction theory. The parties have been invited to lodge a sealed bid before 10 May, after which there will be an auction of the rights by July. Given that the first sealed bid appears not to be binding, it is difficult to see why potential bidders would want to give too much information away before the serious business begins. </p> <p>Auction theory also shows up glaring inconsistencies in government policy. </p> <p>Toehold effects, identified as a primary reason for blocking BSkyB's bid for Man Utd in the Competition Commission's report, have not been ended. BSkyB, and to a smaller extent other broadcasters, continue to collect small stakes in Premier League clubs. </p> <p>Similarly, why in a climate of converging technologies are auctions designed to extract the maximum fees from bidders for mobile phone operators, when television operators need only have their licences rubber-stamped by the ITC for comparatively pitiful sums of money? </p> <p>As consumers begin to get used to auctions through Internet sites such as QXL and eBay, analysis of auction behaviour will become an increasingly fertile area for research. </p> <p>And given that, the Premier League might consider employing a leading game theorist to design an auction before they are going, going, gone. </p> <p><strong>Under the hammer</strong></p> <p><strong> 1.

I can only assume they had all read an article suggesting that popping a zinc pill would act as a cure-all.</p> <p>If you are ever swayed by such articles, I'd like to offer you a few words of warning. Many readers don't realise that some articles written by nutritional therapists are either directly or indirectly commissioned by companies which manufacture supplements and who clearly have a vested interest in promoting sales. Some journalists, furthermore, find it quite difficult either to gain access to unbiased research or to consult independent nutritional consultants and practitioners. On top of this, far too many therapists are either not sufficiently qualified to make a sound clinical judgment or have been offered a financial incentive to sell certain supplements. Because many therapists are paid a share of the profits of such sales, journalists and patients who consult them may be given subjective, rather than objective, advice.</p> <p>The incorrect prescribing of supplements was recently highlighted by Which Health (published by the Consumers Association). It was highly critical of food therapists, concluding that, as a body, they had a 'haphazard and inconsistent approach'. The report cited the experiences of undercover researchers who reported symptoms of irritable-bowel syndrome (IBS) to 14 nutritional therapists. The report's findings included the following criticisms:</p> <p>\u0095 Five of the therapists made no reference to the researchers' GPs, and only three recommended that the researchers should consult their doctors.</p> <p>\u0095 The dietary advice given by most of the therapists was general healthy-eating advice rather than information about how to combat the reported symptoms of IBS.</p> <p>\u0095 Some dietary advice that was given was simply wrong, for example, recommending carrot juice as a good source of calcium.</p> <p>\u0095 Products were recommended or sold at 12 of the consultations. These included vitamin and mineral supplements, digestive enzymes, linseed oil, blue-green algae, lecithin granules, psyllium husks, herb and vitamin mixtures and probiotic supplements.

You may recall that last year I explained the difference between dieticians and nutritionists, a distinction that I think is worth repeating. Dieticians must hold a dietetic degree or diploma (having previously received a degree in a related subject) and must also work within the medical profession - they cannot see people without a medical referral. In addition, dieticians are regulated by both the British Dietetic Association and the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. Nutritionists, nutritional therapists, food therapists or diet therapists - or whatever they style themselves - are not currently regulated by any legal body, with the result that anyone can set up in practice.</p> <p>While I, along with the Consumers Association, do recognise some organisations, such as the Society for the Promotion of Nutritional Therapy, the British Association of Nutritional Therapists (BANT) and the Institute of Optimum Nutrition (ION) - none of these are regulated by law, which means that we cannot rely on their standards of care. Indeed, Which Health found that 'the performance of the BANT nutritional therapists wasn't any better than that of the other therapists'. For its part, BANT says that by choosing a BANT-registered therapist you have the assurance that the therapist is insured and that you furthermore have the benefit of a body to complain to should you be unhappy with your treatment.</p> <p>The best way in which to safeguard your health - and your wallet - is to contact the British Dietetic Association (0121 616 4900) and ask for its list of state-registered dieticians (SRDs). In order to qualify for the SRD accreditation, dieticians must work within the medical profession and cannot give you specific advice until you have officially registered with them as a patient. (This professional stipulation explains why I cannot answer a reader's individual health or therapeutic queries. Unless you are registered with my practice as a patient, I can only give general advice.) Although it may sound pedantic, this rule serves to protect you. For the majority of people, food can be a marvellous healer, but incorrectly prescribed, food can also cause devastating damage. To give just one example, if your dietician doesn't know that you are taking the antidepressant drug monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and recommends you eat more cheese, the consequent interaction between the drug and the cheese could be fatal. This is why it is vital you are referred to a dietician by your GP. Remember, too, that dieticians are barred from selling nutritional supplements, although they can recommend a particular supplement and dosage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, many doctors won't offer to refer you to a dietician because they don't believe that diet can play a role in helping you to overcome your particular condition (which may be why some people consult nutritionists who don't require a referral from a GP). Quite understandably, many medical practitioners whom I have questioned don't have confidence in the dietetic or nutritional professions because they feel they cannot rely on the qualifications of nutritionists and don't fully understand the distinction between dieticians and nutritionists. Yet I firmly believe doctors should be in favour of referring people to dieticians. After all, changing someone's diet can improve their health without the need to resort to expensive medication and treatments.</p> <p>Finally, back to zinc; one of the most popular supplements being prescribed at the moment. This element performs many important functions within the body, including maintaining a healthy immune system. A deficiency of zinc may result in a loss of appetite, the slow healing of wounds, skin complaints and sexual problems ranging from a low libido through a low-sperm count to sterility. It is vital that you don't take more than 15 to 20mg of zinc a day, however, because excess zinc can cause your body to become more susceptible to bacterial infections (which may explain why some people develop chest infections after they have taken a zinc supplement to get over a cold). In order to ensure their zinc levels remain balanced, I prefer to encourage my patients to eat more zinc-rich foods, from which the body will absorb only what it needs and no more. Such foods include shellfish and canned sardines, turkey, duck, goose and lean meats like beef, lamb and, pork, as well as liver and kidneys. Parmesan and other hard, or crumbly, cheeses, including Cheddar, also contain high levels of zinc, as do eggs, wholegrain bread, brown rice and pulses, nuts and seeds (also in peanut butter and tahini), dried apricots, fresh peas and, finally, passion fruit. You should ideally include one of these rich sources of zinc in your daily diet, perhaps in the form of a sandwich made with wholemeal bread, Cheddar cheese and tomato chutney, or one of my own favourite childhood snacks, tinned sardines on warm toast. If you don't like or eat many of these foods, consult a dietician for advice on alternative options.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ruined at Christmas, new career by Easter - truly the rewards of corruption in this country are quite magnificent. Neil Hamilton lost his libel case against Mohamed al-Fayed on 21 December, and for a moment it seemed the Hamiltons were finally crushed, as they talked about bankruptcy and having to sell their house in Cheshire. But forget all that - the house is still theirs, the threat of bankruptcy has receded, they are even planning to appeal against the libel verdict. And now Christine has her own television show - happy days are here again. </p> <p>I suppose you get used to surviving disgrace when you've done it as often as the Hamiltons - first, when the Guardian exposed the cash for questions scandal in l994; second, when the electors of Tatton rejected him; third, when the Downey Report found 'compelling evidence' that he had accepted cash from Fayed; fourth when he lost his case - Liar-v-Liar as the Sun dubbed it - against Fayed. </p> <p>Christine says there were times in this saga when she was temporarily embarrassed: 'But that's all absolutely a thing of the past now. It was difficult straight after the verdict, because you don't know what people are thinking. But now Neil is perfectly happy out and about - he got mobbed by the girls in Safeway the other day. People come up and say good luck, and it is heartwarming. I mean we don't fool ourselves. I'm well aware that millions of people think we're horrendous and corrupt, but you can't think about that.' </p> <p>Not thinking about it is one of her coping mechanisms: 'I just blot out the bad bits of the whole of my life, because it's easier if you do.' Hence her relentless jolly hockey sticks bravado, which is somehow admirable and repellent at the same time. She is Mrs Thatcher writ small: if she does have any moments of self-doubt she never admits them. I met her alone at their flat - Neil was off at their accountants - and kept offering her the deluded-wife escape option, but she flatly refused to take it: 'If Neil's a liar, I'm a liar; if Neil's corrupt, I'm corrupt.' </p> <p>So be it. Anyway, she's bounced back. I imagine she always bounces back. Within a fortnight of the Fayed verdict, she'd received not one but two television offers. They came to her, she says. 'I haven't sort of hawked myself around.' But luckily it was just what she had always wanted. The first offer was for an obscure cable channel called Simply Money; the second was for the digital channel BBC Choice for which she is making The Christine Hamilton Show, no less. Her present series runs for six programmes, but if it's a success the BBC has the option on another twelve. </p> <p>She describes her show as 'conversations with people who have been through stormy waters and survived' - so I thought at first it was a sailing programme but it turns out not. Her roster of interviewees includes Jonathan Aitken, James Hewitt, Kara Noble (another cad, who sold pictures of topless Sophie Rhys-Jones to the tabloids and has now moved to America), a trio of disgraced former MPs (Harvey Proctor, Piers Merchant and David Ashby), a couple of footballers (Paul Merson and John Fashanu), then Michael Cole (Fayed's former PR) and Anil Bhoyrul the ex Mirror City Slicker. The only name missing is Jeffrey Archer - she claims not to know whether he was asked. </p> <p>Rather oddly, Tony Slattery is in there too after a 'four-year battle with depression'. I suppose the common theme is that they all - except perhaps Slattery - will want to have a good whinge about the wicked press, and who better to do it to than Christine Hamilton? No danger of her being 'judgmental' or, as far as I can gather, asking any awkward questions at all. </p> <p>'I don't go in under the ribs, I just couldn't do that to somebody. I've been skewered and stitched up so many times and it's not in my nature to do it.' </p> <p>Really? I thought she prided herself on being a battleaxe. She did after all write a book called British Battleaxes, which included herself, but she says that was misleading. </p> <p>'I hate confrontation and conflict. I really don't enjoy it. I like to get on with people. I can't bear the thought - well, I say I can't bear it, I don't think about it - that there are millions of people out there who think I'm absolutely ghastly because of the press I've had.' So forget battleaxe, think caring sharing on the sofa with all these survivors of stormy waters. How was dear old Jonathan? Still wielding his trusty sword of truth, with God in his Rolex? 'He was in very good humour. It's amazing the way he's come through everything. He was very amusing about life in prison. He got on terribly well with people and he said it's an extraordinary experience to suddenly be thrown together with people who you probably wouldn't have met otherwise.' </p> <p>I dare say. Of course, disgrace brings all sorts of new friends - Christine Hamilton, for instance, barely knew Aitken before his downfall, but she wrote to him in prison and asked him to dinner when he came out. 'So he's a new friend. And obviously we've both suffered from the Guardian, so I suppose that was a bond - friendship in adversity.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, Neil is busy clearing up after their libel action and has been astonishingly successful so far. When the case ended just before Christmas, he was left owing all Fayed's legal costs as well as his own (three-quarters of a million pounds) and supposedly facing bankruptcy and the inevitable sale of their house in Cheshire.</p> <p>But that's all changed, according to Christine: 'We've now had all these developments about the police investigating the allegations that Fayed paid \u00a310,000 for documents stolen from our lawyers' dustbins. And the police are now investigating. Whether they actually do anything is another matter, because they seem to be rather slow-moving. But on the strength of that we went back to court and got the cost order against Neil suspended, and stopped Fayed making Neil bankrupt. And we've now applied formally to have the costs order lifted completely.' </p> <p>Moreover, she says, they are now planning to appeal against the libel verdict. But how can they, when they still owe their lawyers three quarters of a million? 'We've got very patient lawyers, who believe in us.' But why go on? Even if they could overturn the Fayed verdict, they're never going to lose the stigma of the Downey Report. For a moment, Christine loses her bravado and looks defeated: 'I know. Why go on?' But then she braces herself: 'Well, because - if it was your reputation, if you'd been castigated as a liar and corrupt, what would you do? We're not obsessed about it, we're getting on with our lives. And we've hopefully got lots of our life left and it's something that would eat away at us.' </p> <p>But Christine, you still can't alter the basic facts, I tell her - at the very least, you took a socking great freebie from Fayed. 'It wasn't a socking great freebie - it was no more or less than a very large number of other people did. I mean now an MP doesn't take a lump of sugar without declaring it, but in the Eighties the climate was completely different, it was not regarded as wrong to accept hospitality. Go to Wimbledon any day and it was packed with MPs. Go to Ascot, Covent Garden - packed with MPs. All we ask is to be judged by the standards of the time. It wasn't as if we came back from the Ritz and said Gosh, no one must know about this. We were full of it, we were so excited about it.' </p> <p>Perhaps this was the Hamiltons' fatal flaw - everyone was doing it but they were too damn full of it; they were rubbing other people's noses in it. But of course the libel case unveiled convincing evidence that Neil Hamilton took cash as well as hospitality. And just the other day the Sunday People published yet another allegation, when a beer importer called Andrew Ronnan claimed Hamilton took bribes from brewers while he was at the DTI. 'Oh, that's absolute nonsense on stilts,' says Christine. So will they be suing? 'No, the People's not worth suing really. I mean the idea that Neil had \u00a3200,000 over the table, or under the table, from the brewers! Honestly, it's just tabloid muck-raking.' </p> <p>But it's yet another little diversion to keep Neil busy. He doesn't seem to have bounced back with quite the same \u00e9lan as her. So what's he up to now? </p> <p>'Oh he's up to all sorts of things. First, there's the ongoing legal bit - that obviously occupies some of his time. And he is writing a novel - we're both writing novels - but it's very difficult for him to find the concentration. He's actually involved in a business thing at the moment, he's teamed up with an inventor - which is not something he's ever done before - so hopefully that will work. What he'll eventually do, I don't know.' </p> <p>Why can't he go back to being a tax barrister? 'But what firm of chambers is going to take him on? You can't go back. Anyway, he's 51, you can't start to rebuild a career that you haven't touched for 20 years. Neil is pretty unemployable.' </p> <p>But meanwhile, he's been very helpful while she's been doing her television series: 'He's taken his duties as a house husband very seriously, and he now goes off to the supermarket and he's an incredibly economical shopper. He looks for the bargains and he'll come back with things I've never bought in my life because they're three for the price of two!' </p> <p>I imagine this might be increasingly the pattern of their lives - Christine working more and more and Neil less and less. It would put a strain on most marriages, but not theirs. 'I'd rather be in the biggest pickle with Neil,' she says stoutly, 'than on a Caribbean island with somebody else.' </p> <p>Anyway, as far as she's concerned, it's all turned out rather well. 'I mean I feel 100 per cent liberated being out of politics - I can't tell you - I really do feel Wey hey! Almost - almost - thank you Mr Fayed. Because, you know, I spent 28 years in politics and I've now joined the 98 per cent of the population who frankly don't give a damn what goes on at Westminster and it's wonderful. It's great to have a change at the age of 50 and be able to start a completely new life. And Neil doesn't sit here thinking, \"Gosh, I wish I was Chancellor of the Exchequer.\" We're having a very exciting time now, and we're enjoying it. I know some people think we should be sitting in sackcloth and ashes but life has to go on.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ruined at Christmas, new career by Easter - truly the rewards of corruption in this country are quite magnificent. Neil Hamilton lost his libel case against Mohamed al-Fayed on 21 December, and for a moment it seemed the Hamiltons were finally crushed, as they talked about bankruptcy and having to sell their house in Cheshire. But forget all that - the house is still theirs, the threat of bankruptcy has receded, they are even planning to appeal against the libel verdict. And now Christine has her own television show - happy days are here again. I suppose you get used to surviving disgrace when you've done it as often as the Hamiltons - first, when the Guardian exposed the cash for questions scandal in l994; second, when the electors of Tatton rejected him; third, when the Downey Report found 'compelling evidence' that he had accepted cash from Fayed; fourth when he lost his case - Liar-v-Liar as the Sun dubbed it - against Fayed. Christine says there were times in this saga when she was temporarily embarrassed: 'But that's all absolutely a thing of the past now. It was difficult straight after the verdict, because you don't know what people are thinking. But now Neil is perfectly happy out and about - he got mobbed by the girls in Safeway the other day. People come up and say good luck, and it is heartwarming. I mean we don't fool ourselves. I'm well aware that millions of people think we're horrendous and corrupt, but you can't think about that.' Not thinking about it is one of her coping mechanisms: 'I just blot out the bad bits of the whole of my life, because it's easier if you do.' Hence her relentless jolly hockey sticks bravado, which is somehow admirable and repellent at the same time. She is Mrs Thatcher writ small: if she does have any moments of self-doubt she never admits them. I met her alone at their flat - Neil was off at their accountants - and kept offering her the deluded-wife escape option, but she flatly refused to take it: 'If Neil's a liar, I'm a liar; if Neil's corrupt, I'm corrupt.' So be it. Anyway, she's bounced back. I imagine she always bounces back. Within a fortnight of the Fayed verdict, she'd received not one but two television offers. They came to her, she says. 'I haven't sort of hawked myself around.' But luckily it was just what she had always wanted. The first offer was for an obscure cable channel called Simply Money; the second was for the digital channel BBC Choice for which she is making The Christine Hamilton Show, no less. Her present series runs for six programmes, but if it's a success the BBC has the option on another twelve. She describes her show as 'conversations with people who have been through stormy waters and survived' - so I thought at first it was a sailing programme but it turns out not. Her roster of interviewees includes Jonathan Aitken, James Hewitt, Kara Noble (another cad, who sold pictures of topless Sophie Rhys-Jones to the tabloids and has now moved to America), a trio of disgraced former MPs (Harvey Proctor, Piers Merchant and David Ashby), a couple of footballers (Paul Merson and John Fashanu), then Michael Cole (Fayed's former PR) and Anil Bhoyrul the ex Mirror City Slicker. The only name missing is Jeffrey Archer - she claims not to know whether he was asked. Rather oddly, Tony Slattery is in there too after a 'four-year battle with depression'. I suppose the common theme is that they all - except perhaps Slattery - will want to have a good whinge about the wicked press, and who better to do it to than Christine Hamilton? No danger of her being 'judgmental' or, as far as I can gather, asking any awkward questions at all. 'I don't go in under the ribs, I just couldn't do that to somebody. I've been skewered and stitched up so many times and it's not in my nature to do it.' Really? I thought she prided herself on being a battleaxe. She did after all write a book called British Battleaxes, which included herself, but she says that was misleading. 'I hate confrontation and conflict. I really don't enjoy it. I like to get on with people. I can't bear the thought - well, I say I can't bear it, I don't think about it - that there are millions of people out there who think I'm absolutely ghastly because of the press I've had.'

These are characterised by feelings of sadness and a tendency to cry easily. For most mothers these feelings are short-lived, passing within a few days. But a significant number of women are not so lucky. They fall beyond the blues, becoming clinically depressed.</p> <p>Postnatal depression affects 10 per cent of mothers. Symptoms are the same as those of depressive episodes not related to pregnancy and birth. They include irritability, anxiety, listlessness, poor concentration and even hopelessness. These negative emotions are bound to take their toll on the mother-baby relationship.</p> <p>Dr Vivette Glover, head of a research team at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in west London, has been investigating postnatal depression for the past 10 years. 'Mothers with postnatal depression often fail to relate to their children in the normal way,' she says.</p> <p>By carefully examining video recordings of mothers with their infants, many researchers have been able to characterise typical mother-baby interactions. 'A healthy mother will react to her child - if the baby smiles the mother will smile back, if it makes an 'aah' sound the mother will respond with a similar noise,' says Dr Glover. 'Depressed mothers, on the other hand, tend to be silent and look away, alternatively they may try too hard and be over-intrusive, causing the baby to become distressed.'</p> <p>While postnatal depression responds rapidly to treatment, it is now clear that the condition has consequences which, for the infant, may be much more long-term. Children whose mothers suffer postnatal depression are at an increased risk of developing cognitive and behavioural problems in later years. At age four they are less cognitively able than their peers. This may have serious consequences for their subsequent academic development.</p> <p>During the infant's first few months of life it is particularly sensitive to human contact. Patterns of behavioural activity between parent and child become established and, thereafter, are extremely difficult to break. Many developmental problems may have their roots in a strained mother-child relationship set up in the first months of life.</p> <p>The long-term effects associated with postnatal depression make its prompt diagnosis and treatment all the more vital. Antidepressant medication, such as Prozac, has been shown to relieve the condition. Similarly, counselling sessions help.

By learning to interpret their baby's body language,' she continues, 'mothers can adjust their reactions appropriately.

'We do not tell parents what to do, we teach through facilitation.' The end result is a class that teaches communication rather than simply massage.

      "body": "<p>Rudy Giuliani picks at ham and eggs, sipping furtively from a cup of coffee. John McCain, his self-described 'soul mate' and campaign support act, pours cream and sugar into his. McCain doesn't actually touch the cup but the point here is not to drink coffee, rather, to leave a tip at the Landmark diner in Roslyn, Long Island. </p> <p>Rudy reaches into the right back pocket of his trousers, pulls out a generous $20 bill and slaps it down on the Formica-topped table. Just to show that he is not a carpetbagging alien like that Clinton woman, who had breezed out of a breakfast joint in Manhattan a few days previously leaving no tip at all for the wretched waitress. Just to show that Hurricane Rudy is a man of the people. 'Rudy without the Rude' as they are now trying to sell him. Which is absurd, because without the rude, it isn't Rudy. </p> <p>Giuliani and his star support act look good together - two men who are scratchier, more stubborn and principled than the Republican party machine they serve. Eggs eaten and tip deposited, they board the bus to continue along what will be the most electrifying US campaign trail in decades, the nastiest, most jagged clash of cheese-grater egos within living political memory - His Honour the Mayor versus the First Lady in the contest for a seat in the Senate. </p> <p>For a year, Giuliani has led Hillary Clinton in the polls, which is itself not remarkable for a man rightly credited with having led New York's urban renaissance; it should be no contest, a walkover. But now Clinton is stealing a march. Last week, for the first time, Giuliani's aides were not brushing off the polls as whimsy and fad, mainly because the reason for Clinton's apparent acceleration ahead of her rival is nothing to do with her - it reflects something mysterious and ambivalent between the most popular Mayor New York has ever had and his citizenry. </p> <p>This man making his weaselish way through the crowds on Long Island has remained as enigmatic as he is ubiquitous. Giuliani looks prickly and embattled these days; the comparison with Richard Nixon is irresistible. He has lost weight, he looks gaunt and menacing. His facial muscles work hard, indicating distress as well as unrelenting energy. There seem to be two Rudy Giulianis fighting this election: one, the dragon-slaying District Attorney who was elected mayor and set out to make New York a greater place; the other, a man propelled by deeper, more personal and complicated - perhaps even darker - motives. </p> <p>It has been a bittersweet couple of weeks for Giuliani. After the jolt in the opinion polls came the political equivalent of a midwinter holiday in the sun - opening day at Yankee Stadium, which is home turf for the Mayor. He wore his 'NY' cap and jumped in the air like a schoolboy along with tens of thousands of other people who adore him second only to the Bronx Bombers themselves.</p> <p>But behind this happy break, yet another rupture has opened up at Giuliani's fortress of City Hall, where both the politics and the psychodrama of his administration are played out. Just as he is embarking on an embrace of every voter in New York State, Giuliani has become more and more reclusive, his cabal of confidants and allies ever-shrinking into a tight circle of almost Bolshevik intensity. And last week, that circle shrunk yet again, by one.</p> <p>The city's comptroller - or top civil servant - Alan Hevesi had never been part of the inner, inner sanctum. He was a Democrat, for a start, but leader of that crucial constituency of 'Giuliani Democrats'. He was happy to work with the Mayor; he represented the middle-class whites who voted him into power along with blacks and Hispanics from the ghetto who had lived on the sharp end of New York's savage crime figures at the start of the decade, and therefore reaped the benefits of Giuliani's famously effective assault upon them. In other words, Hevesi represents the people Giuliani needs to defeat Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>Last week, there were early warning signs - then grudging confirmation - of a latest blazing row between the increasingly besieged Mayor and Hevesi. Hevesi was the policy wonk behind Giuliani's street fighting, but now he said: 'I am not his political ally. I am not his friend. I support Hillary Clinton.' Aides say the row was about welfare policy. Hevesi was even reported as having branded the Mayor a 'liar' in one meeting, with Giuliani retorting that his erstwhile ally 'is a thief'. It is what the Roman Forum must have sounded like at the end of empire. </p> <p>The row with Hevesi is not the only crack in Giuliani's column of power. There have been others, far more serious, in recent weeks, not least the minor riot in Little Haiti that accompanied the funeral of the latest black victim of the NYPD, Patrick Dorismond, shot in a brawl with the cops in midtown Manhattan, whose sealed juvenile record was prized open by Giuliani almost before his corpse had petrified. </p> <p>But memory is fickle, short and unforgiving, especially in the case of New York and Rudy Giuliani. When he won the mayoral election of 1993, New York had been written off as ungoverned and apparently ungovernable. The murder rate was at a record high; there was a sense that the rule of law had collapsed. The public sector under Mayor David Dinkins was a lurching, corrupt miasma of Byzantine patronage operating like a Mafia statelet and spending public money as though there were no tomorrow. The economy was in ruins. </p> <p>Giuliani and his then police commissioner William Bratton took an axe first to crime, and to the roots of policy on crime. The received wisdom was that crime would be solved through political means: gun control, welfare spending, education spending, public housing and other estimable policies accompanied by 'community policing'. Against this approach, Giuliani tried what he called the 'broken windows' method, also known as 'zero tolerance': the idea that allowing one broken window to go unmended encourages vandals to break more. Translated, it meant that the authorities would stop small problems turning into big ones by targeting them head-on, specifically the drug rings and the guns that empowered them. </p> <p>The results are well-known. The murder rate plunged by roughly 100 people a month. Had it remained at the level it was in the last year of the Dinkins administration, 1,328 New Yorkers would now be dead who are not. By 1998, New York recorded fewer murders than Chicago, a city one-third its size. The area that saw the sharpest drop in the crime rate was the black area of Harlem, where violent crime fell by 61 per cent between 1994 and 1998. Giuliani had overturned three decades of thinking about how to enforce the law in America and the ghetto was the first place to breathe the oxygen of relative safety. </p> <p>At the spearhead of this attack was a new police division called the street crimes unit, which operated from precinct to precinct. It is remarkable how much damage 362 cops can inflict on a city of 7.5 million people. In the two years up until its apocalyptic and disastrous moment - the killing of an unarmed West African called Amadou Diallo - the unit made 9,500 arrests, mostly for illegal firearms, in 45,000 stops, a hit-rate of 20 per cent. Looked at another way: 0.3 per cent of the NYPD was confiscating 40 per cent of the guns. </p> <p>Crime was not the only notch on Giuliani's staff. In 1993, New York was losing 7,000 jobs a month, a total of 330,000 during the Dinkins administration. Last year, however, the city's economy grew faster than that of the nation for the first time in a decade. Private-sector jobs expanded at an all-time record pace. Nowhere was the new affluence more visible than in Harlem, undergoing what was called a 'second renaissance'. </p> <p>The man elected to rule the metropolis came from a family that epitomises the epic of New York City. He was the grandson of poor Italian immigrants and only child to parents who considered his birth to be a divine miracle in answer to their prayers. His childhood was wrapped in a deep Catholicism, especially by his father. As in many Catholic homes, John F. Kennedy was the household icon alongside the Messiah. The young boy was diligent, hard working and almost as ambitious for himself as his mother Helen was. There was corporal punishment at home, and at Bishop Loughlin High in Brooklyn, run by the Christian Brothers. It was the best for miles around - each parish in Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island could send only its two brightest pupils. </p> <p>The Brothers were also a guiding hand behind Manhattan College in the Bronx, to which Giuliani proceeded, majoring in political science and philosophy. He considered the priesthood, but his fondness for women was an obvious obstacle to such a plan. Instead, he went to NYU to read law. An excavation of his writing in the university law review makes interesting reading: he supported the Senate candidacy of the man then decried by the New York Times as a 'carpetbagger', Robert F. Kennedy. He despised Barry Goldwater. Giuliani's views were broadly liberal; the Republican congressman for Long Island, Peter King, even recalls the student Giuliani being sympathetic towards the race rioters in Watts and Chicago. </p> <p>But Giuliani was a Republican and moral crusader, and his destiny was to be a prosecutor pointing the righteous finger of accusation. In the month in 1968 that his hero Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, Giuliani began his clerkship and soon dazzled in court with cross-examination as sharp as a scalpel blade. The young prosecutor found a political mentor called Harold Tyler in the Ford administration, but the advent of Jimmy Carter to the White House sent him back into private practice, and a partnership in the Manhattan law firm, Patterson's, until the call came to serve under the Reagan administration in 1981. During that time, he would work by day and party by night. One of the firm's young hopefuls, Renee Szybala recalls chancing upon the prodigy Giuliani one night on a dance floor. 'I was flabbergasted,' she says. 'It was not the usual place to meet partners.' </p> <p>Even now, he likes a dance, loves the attention of women and enjoys a show - he was an opera-lover even as a child - especially when he is the star. There was a party last year for a carefully picked selection from the City Hall politburo at which Rudy surprised the company by turning up in drag. The wig was auburn, the dress a cling-fit. Then there was the night he met and even flirted with Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>This was only last month, at a banquet at the Midtown Hilton. When Hillary entered, Rudy seized her hand and greeted her like a prom queen. 'I hear you're the star of the show,' said Hillary with a coquettish smile. 'We'll see,' replied the Mayor. A few minutes later, Rudy reappeared, the tux exchanged for a John Travolta-style pressed white suit. The Bee Gees struck up and Rudy shook his stuff to 'Night Fever', leading a blonde in a backless number and heels to kill with. </p> <p>When violence shattered the funeral of Patrick Dorismond in Brooklyn's Little Haiti two weeks ago, it was not only Giuliani's insensitive handling of the dead man's petty criminal record that detonated emotions on the street. The collective memory of Haiti's wretched diaspora recalls well that a young Turk in the Justice Department called Giuliani once represented the US government in its refusal of political asylum to thousands of desperate boat people in flight from the Tonton Macoute. And that he made a visit to their country, met its dictator, Baby Doc, and concluded that 'political repression, at least in general, does not exist'. </p> <p>In 1983, Giuliani moved back to New York, to become District Attorney. It was a curious career move: by then, aged only 38, he was the most senior federal prosecutor in the land. But it was the city state not the nation state that interested Giuliani, and he declared unrelenting war on the column of power that governed that city state in parallel to his own: Cosa Nostra. In a series of investigations and court cases before which Martin Scorsese's movies pale, Giuliani began branding his imprint on New York life. He broke the Mafia's back. He broke the Colombo crime syndicate, he broke mobster, Anthony 'Fat Tony' Salerno, he broke and recruited Sammy 'the Bull' Gravano, thereby laying the ground for the conviction of John Gotti. He also broke into trickery on Wall Street, and made inroads into political corruption. It became quickly clear that New York was never going to recover from this man. </p> <p>This was the man the city - Democratic to the core - rejected once in the mayoral election of 1989 but could not resist again in the mayhem of 1993. His re-election four years later was a foregone conclusion and a landslide. 'Giuliani looked infallible,' said one former adviser, 'and he felt it too. Only problem is that he wasn't and isn't, and he was and is the only person not to realise that.' </p> <p>How could the man at the apex of such a revolution possibly trail in the polls behind the out-of-town wife of an adulterous, impeached President? The story of the fall, like the story of the rise, has crime and street violence as its driving narrative. </p> <p>Ironically, the Mayor had created a good-time mood in New York and he was out of step with that mood. The prosecutor could not stop, and the offences were soon out of proportion to his zeal. Under the aegis of the 'broken windows' policy, Giuliani's crusade expanded from gun-toting drug-dealers to such folk as jaywalkers, hot-dog vendors and zig-zagging cab drivers. The crusade against crime became a crusade against immorality, as porn shops, strip clubs and the Sensation art show came under the Giuliani hammer. </p> <p>The nadir in Giuliani's search for undesirables came last Christmas, when the Mayor declared a cruel war on the homeless. He instructed the police to drive them off the streets and into shelters, where they would have to register for work or face jail. Of course the policy failed, but by then the damage had been done by another Giuliani reform: fatally, he had trebled the size of the street crimes unit. If 138 cops could do all that damage, imagine what 380 could do. But there were not enough veteran officers to go round - only the wild bunch, anxious to do it all. That would be Giuliani's costliest mistake. </p> <p>There was also, meanwhile, a problem of political deportment and the Mayor's outsized personality. Conversations with people who work under and with Giuliani at City Hall all converge on descriptions of how he rules city state New York like a Machiavellian prince holed up in a fortress. And within that fortress is an inner citadel, the Mayor's office. Like any megalomaniac autocrat, Giuliani trusts few if any of his staff and rules from an inner sanctum. 'He centralised everything,' says one aide.'The Mayor knows everything,' Giuliani said recently in unconvincing self-mockery, 'he finds out everything.' </p> <p>When black politicians complain that Giuliani treats them badly, they are right. But Rudy treats all politicians badly. He was never a man in search of advice. 'He is a man of talent, self-confidence and ruthless energy,' said one official still on Giuliani's staff, 'but each of those assets has a flip side. On the other side of the confidence is disdain for others; on the other side of the energy, there's a blind spot'. </p> <p>At the core of the inner sanctum was Giuliani's connection to the outside world, his 'communications director' Chrystine Lategano. She was his shadow, his closest aide. The overt intimacy between the two was brazen and audacious: after spending all day huddled up together in the office, they would adjourn to Cooper's Classic Cigar bar in midtown to continue the never-ending conversation about how to run New York. Donna Hanover - aka Mrs Giuliani - meanwhile kept her maiden name in deed as well as word, hardly ever appearing at official functions and now reported to be living apart from her husband. She even refused to say whether she had voted for him. </p> <p>But even those who worked closely under Giuliani could never prove what happened behind closed doors, and few even want to hypothesise the untold tale of a love affair. 'It is presumed, but not known,' says one former aide. 'It was in the glint of an eye, but no more.' In May last year, Lategano mysteriously quit. The parting was apparently amicable and widely assumed to be a way of fending off the pincer movement of rumour on the one hand and advancing foes on the other. What is astonishing, however, is the contrast between the silent awe at the possibility of Giuliani's affair with Lategano, and the voracious appetite for every detail of the extramarital sex life of Hillary Clinton's husband. </p> <p>When the pool of confidants is a small one, desertion - let alone a brain drain - is a serious matter. One by one, some of the most talented people in City Hall trickled away, cut out of the loop - the artisans of government, the craftsmen and women of civic life. </p> <p>In Lategano's place, Giuliani chose another controversial confidant in Bruce Teitelbaum. Operating as hatchet man, like Giuliani's military wing, Teitelbaum was a faithful pen-pusher in the mayoral campaigns suddenly elevated to become the second most powerful man in the city. And yet Teitelbaum casts his own shadows: he was questioned by the Brooklyn District Attorney this year for connections to an Hassidic Jewish construction consortium associated with the collapse of a building in which two workers were killed. Teitelbaum was said to have fostered special treatment for the company at City Hall in order to maintain good relations with the crucial Jewish community that is said to hold the electoral balance of power in New York. </p> <p>By the start of last year, something was waiting to go wrong for Giuliani. Finally, it happened in the Bronx in February 1999. Four officers from the street crimes unit shot Amadou Diallo, an unarmed, deeply religious, innocent West African street vendor. </p> <p>Giuliani's response to Diallo's death was politically tone-deaf. Which was strange, since his outraged reaction to another police abomination - the torture of a Haitian in policy custody - had been exemplary and prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to call the revolting episode 'Giuliani's finest hour'. Now, he made a series of costly errors. 'Fatally, he presumed he had the family on his side and he did not,' recalls one aide. He said he would 'reserve judgment' on the shooting; he defended the record of the street crimes unit. In the month that followed, his popularity fell by 20 points. </p> <p>Giuliani's enemies were many, but none was more eager to advance against the Mayor than the Rev Al Sharpton, self-appointed leader of the black community. Sharpton needed a break after making a fool of himself in backing a hoax - a woman who said she had been assaulted by the Ku Klux Klan, but had made it up. Now, Sharpton's moment had come and he seized it with relish.</p> <p>From then on, he capitalised on injury to a black community that had benefited most from Giuliani's war on crime, but which now felt itself to be ruled by an army of occupation called the NYPD. The killing of Dorismond last month not only deepened that sentiment but widened it too, calling into the question the mayoralty and character of Giuliani and the price extracted by 'zero tolerance'. Giuliani's reaction to the Dorismond death was so bizarre that even William Bratton, co-architect of zero tolerance, said: 'Like the rest of the New York, I'm appalled. People are beginning to question this guy's judgment.' </p> <p>The late Erik Erikson, Pulitzer Prize-winning psychoanalyst, wrote that great political leaders must be protean to a degree and adopt a range of guises. Thomas Jefferson was Erikson's exemplary specimen and how he would have admired the President named after him, William Jefferson Clinton. And how he would have despaired at Giuliani. 'He strikes me as someone who feels he can shape reality to suit his own interests rather than adjust to it,' said Dr Richard Ulman, a Manhattan psychologist who studies political figures. </p> <p>In this hex, Giuliani becomes his own worst enemy. Because he habitually chooses hubris over contrition, the political complexities of his candidacy get blurred over. He has, actually, taken a moderate stand in many areas of social policy on which he would be required to vote in the Senate and is a downright heretic on such matters as welfare, abortion and gay rights. Only recently has Giuliani had to play at being a partisan Republican, but this he has done with a gusto which may come to haunt him. </p> <p>He has hired the Svengali of direct mailing, Richard Viguerie, to send fusillades of propaganda into the mailboxes of New York. Viguerie is an ideologist of the hard Right, who first practised the art of mass-mailing in the 1960s for the man whom the law student Giuliani passionately loathed, Barry Goldwater. The beneficiaries of his expertise since then have included George Wallace, Oliver North, Jesse Helms and the Rev Sun Il Moon. Giuliani has also accepted free campaign advertising from another right-wing maverick, Howard Ruff, a Utah Mormon with 18 grandchildren who is buying TV time and Netspace to become Hillary Clinton's latest rabid antagonist. 'It's easier to kill a baby snake than a 12-foot king cobra,' ranted Ruff. 'We need to stop this woman.' </p> <p>In this artificially polarised climate, not only do Giuliani's achievements get overlooked, but also the facts about the now accursed NYPD. The reality is that along with crime, police violence in New York is also down to an all-time record low, the force never more disciplined. Fatalities per capita as a result of police guns are way below those of, say, Washington DC, which has a black Mayor. Indeed, the race card too fails to convince, insofar as Giuliani's achievements in New York are rivalled - and probably exceeded - only by those of his opposite number in New Orleans. There, Mayor Marc Morial has deployed an iron fist to punch down crime and murder rates and presided over an extraordinary economic boom. Morial is black; he was a civil rights activist. They even call him the 'black Giuliani' down on the bayou - and that's a compliment. </p> <p>Deep down, New Yorkers know all this when they size up Hillary Clinton's bromide smile against Giuliani's grimace and that is why only a fool or a pollster would dismiss Giuliani at this stage. Either because of or despite the fact that he is the most remarkable politician in America, Giuliani doesn't take much notice of polls - but then nor do most New Yorkers. Even the fact that Giuliani has the political subtlety of a juggernaut without brakes can play to his advantage in this city. </p> <p>A friend of mine - America's leading writer on what propels the intelligent criminal mind - speaks for most of New York when she says: 'I am angry with Giuliani and grateful to him at the same time. Anyone who is honest in this town is torn about Rudy. And knows that we're all in the shitpan when he leaves us. He behaves horribly, but New York behaves horribly. He's our guy, he's an asshole, but he's our asshole'.</p>",

There seem to be two Rudy Giulianis fighting this election: one, the dragon-slaying District Attorney who was elected mayor and set out to make New York a greater place; the other, a man propelled by deeper, more personal and complicated - perhaps even darker - motives. It has been a bittersweet couple of weeks for Giuliani. After the jolt in the opinion polls came the political equivalent of a midwinter holiday in the sun - opening day at Yankee Stadium, which is home turf for the Mayor. He wore his 'NY' cap and jumped in the air like a schoolboy along with tens of thousands of other people who adore him second only to the Bronx Bombers themselves. But behind this happy break, yet another rupture has opened up at Giuliani's fortress of City Hall, where both the politics and the psychodrama of his administration are played out. Just as he is embarking on an embrace of every voter in New York State, Giuliani has become more and more reclusive, his cabal of confidants and allies ever-shrinking into a tight circle of almost Bolshevik intensity. And last week, that circle shrunk yet again, by one. The city's comptroller - or top civil servant - Alan Hevesi had never been part of the inner, inner sanctum. He was a Democrat, for a start, but leader of that crucial constituency of 'Giuliani Democrats'. He was happy to work with the Mayor; he represented the middle-class whites who voted him into power along with blacks and Hispanics from the ghetto who had lived on the sharp end of New York's savage crime figures at the start of the decade, and therefore reaped the benefits of Giuliani's famously effective assault upon them. In other words, Hevesi represents the people Giuliani needs to defeat Hillary Clinton. Last week, there were early warning signs - then grudging confirmation - of a latest blazing row between the increasingly besieged Mayor and Hevesi. Hevesi was the policy wonk behind Giuliani's street fighting, but now he said: 'I am not his political ally. I am not his friend. I support Hillary Clinton.' Aides say the row was about welfare policy. Hevesi was even reported as having branded the Mayor a 'liar' in one meeting, with Giuliani retorting that his erstwhile ally 'is a thief'. It is what the Roman Forum must have sounded like at the end of empire. The row with Hevesi is not the only crack in Giuliani's column of power. There have been others, far more serious, in recent weeks, not least the minor riot in Little Haiti that accompanied the funeral of the latest black victim of the NYPD, Patrick Dorismond, shot in a brawl with the cops in midtown Manhattan, whose sealed juvenile record was prized open by Giuliani almost before his corpse had petrified. But memory is fickle, short and unforgiving, especially in the case of New York and Rudy Giuliani. When he won the mayoral election of 1993, New York had been written off as ungoverned and apparently ungovernable. The murder rate was at a record high; there was a sense that the rule of law had collapsed. The public sector under Mayor David Dinkins was a lurching, corrupt miasma of Byzantine patronage operating like a Mafia statelet and spending public money as though there were no tomorrow. The economy was in ruins. Giuliani and his then police commissioner William Bratton took an axe first to crime, and to the roots of policy on crime. The received wisdom was that crime would be solved through political means: gun control, welfare spending, education spending, public housing and other estimable policies accompanied by 'community policing'. Against this approach, Giuliani tried what he called the 'broken windows' method, also known as 'zero tolerance': the idea that allowing one broken window to go unmended encourages vandals to break more. Translated, it meant that the authorities would stop small problems turning into big ones by targeting them head-on, specifically the drug rings and the guns that empowered them. The results are well-known. The murder rate plunged by roughly 100 people a month. Had it remained at the level it was in the last year of the Dinkins administration, 1,328 New Yorkers would now be dead who are not. By 1998, New York recorded fewer murders than Chicago, a city one-third its size. The area that saw the sharpest drop in the crime rate was the black area of Harlem, where violent crime fell by 61 per cent between 1994 and 1998. Giuliani had overturned three decades of thinking about how to enforce the law in America and the ghetto was the first place to breathe the oxygen of relative safety. At the spearhead of this attack was a new police division called the street crimes unit, which operated from precinct to precinct. It is remarkable how much damage 362 cops can inflict on a city of 7.5 million people. In the two years up until its apocalyptic and disastrous moment - the killing of an unarmed West African called Amadou Diallo - the unit made 9,500 arrests, mostly for illegal firearms, in 45,000 stops, a hit-rate of 20 per cent. Looked at another way: 0.3 per cent of the NYPD was confiscating 40 per cent of the guns. Crime was not the only notch on Giuliani's staff. In 1993, New York was losing 7,000 jobs a month, a total of 330,000 during the Dinkins administration. Last year, however, the city's economy grew faster than that of the nation for the first time in a decade. Private-sector jobs expanded at an all-time record pace. Nowhere was the new affluence more visible than in Harlem, undergoing what was called a 'second renaissance'. The man elected to rule the metropolis came from a family that epitomises the epic of New York City. He was the grandson of poor Italian immigrants and only child to parents who considered his birth to be a divine miracle in answer to their prayers. His childhood was wrapped in a deep Catholicism, especially by his father. As in many Catholic homes, John F. Kennedy was the household icon alongside the Messiah. The young boy was diligent, hard working and almost as ambitious for himself as his mother Helen was. There was corporal punishment at home, and at Bishop Loughlin High in Brooklyn, run by the Christian Brothers. It was the best for miles around - each parish in Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island could send only its two brightest pupils. The Brothers were also a guiding hand behind Manhattan College in the Bronx, to which Giuliani proceeded, majoring in political science and philosophy. He considered the priesthood, but his fondness for women was an obvious obstacle to such a plan. Instead, he went to NYU to read law. An excavation of his writing in the university law review makes interesting reading: he supported the Senate candidacy of the man then decried by the New York Times as a 'carpetbagger', Robert F. Kennedy. He despised Barry Goldwater. Giuliani's views were broadly liberal; the Republican congressman for Long Island, Peter King, even recalls the student Giuliani being sympathetic towards the race rioters in Watts and Chicago. But Giuliani was a Republican and moral crusader, and his destiny was to be a prosecutor pointing the righteous finger of accusation. In the month in 1968 that his hero Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, Giuliani began his clerkship and soon dazzled in court with cross-examination as sharp as a scalpel blade. The young prosecutor found a political mentor called Harold Tyler in the Ford administration, but the advent of Jimmy Carter to the White House sent him back into private practice, and a partnership in the Manhattan law firm, Patterson's, until the call came to serve under the Reagan administration in 1981. During that time, he would work by day and party by night. One of the firm's young hopefuls, Renee Szybala recalls chancing upon the prodigy Giuliani one night on a dance floor. 'I was flabbergasted,' she says. 'It was not the usual place to meet partners.' Even now, he likes a dance, loves the attention of women and enjoys a show - he was an opera-lover even as a child - especially when he is the star. There was a party last year for a carefully picked selection from the City Hall politburo at which Rudy surprised the company by turning up in drag. The wig was auburn, the dress a cling-fit. Then there was the night he met and even flirted with Hillary Clinton. This was only last month, at a banquet at the Midtown Hilton. When Hillary entered, Rudy seized her hand and greeted her like a prom queen. 'I hear you're the star of the show,' said Hillary with a coquettish smile. 'We'll see,' replied the Mayor. A few minutes later, Rudy reappeared, the tux exchanged for a John Travolta-style pressed white suit. The Bee Gees struck up and Rudy shook his stuff to 'Night Fever', leading a blonde in a backless number and heels to kill with. When violence shattered the funeral of Patrick Dorismond in Brooklyn's Little Haiti two weeks ago, it was not only Giuliani's insensitive handling of the dead man's petty criminal record that detonated emotions on the street. The collective memory of Haiti's wretched diaspora recalls well that a young Turk in the Justice Department called Giuliani once represented the US government in its refusal of political asylum to thousands of desperate boat people in flight from the Tonton Macoute. And that he made a visit to their country, met its dictator, Baby Doc, and concluded that 'political repression, at least in general, does not exist'. In 1983, Giuliani moved back to New York, to become District Attorney. It was a curious career move: by then, aged only 38, he was the most senior federal prosecutor in the land. But it was the city state not the nation state that interested Giuliani, and he declared unrelenting war on the column of power that governed that city state in parallel to his own: Cosa Nostra. In a series of investigations and court cases before which Martin Scorsese's movies pale, Giuliani began branding his imprint on New York life. He broke the Mafia's back. He broke the Colombo crime syndicate, he broke mobster, Anthony 'Fat Tony' Salerno, he broke and recruited Sammy 'the Bull' Gravano, thereby laying the ground for the conviction of John Gotti. He also broke into trickery on Wall Street, and made inroads into political corruption. It became quickly clear that New York was never going to recover from this man. This was the man the city - Democratic to the core - rejected once in the mayoral election of 1989 but could not resist again in the mayhem of 1993. His re-election four years later was a foregone conclusion and a landslide. 'Giuliani looked infallible,' said one former adviser, 'and he felt it too. Only problem is that he wasn't and isn't, and he was and is the only person not to realise that.' How could the man at the apex of such a revolution possibly trail in the polls behind the out-of-town wife of an adulterous, impeached President? The story of the fall, like the story of the rise, has crime and street violence as its driving narrative. Ironically, the Mayor had created a good-time mood in New York and he was out of step with that mood. The prosecutor could not stop, and the offences were soon out of proportion to his zeal. Under the aegis of the 'broken windows' policy, Giuliani's crusade expanded from gun-toting drug-dealers to such folk as jaywalkers, hot-dog vendors and zig-zagging cab drivers. The crusade against crime became a crusade against immorality, as porn shops, strip clubs and the Sensation art show came under the Giuliani hammer. The nadir in Giuliani's search for undesirables came last Christmas, when the Mayor declared a cruel war on the homeless. He instructed the police to drive them off the streets and into shelters, where they would have to register for work or face jail. Of course the policy failed, but by then the damage had been done by another Giuliani reform: fatally, he had trebled the size of the street crimes unit. If 138 cops could do all that damage, imagine what 380 could do. But there were not enough veteran officers to go round - only the wild bunch, anxious to do it all. That would be Giuliani's costliest mistake. There was also, meanwhile, a problem of political deportment and the Mayor's outsized personality. Conversations with people who work under and with Giuliani at City Hall all converge on descriptions of how he rules city state New York like a Machiavellian prince holed up in a fortress. And within that fortress is an inner citadel, the Mayor's office. Like any megalomaniac autocrat, Giuliani trusts few if any of his staff and rules from an inner sanctum. 'He centralised everything,' says one aide.'The Mayor knows everything,' Giuliani said recently in unconvincing self-mockery, 'he finds out everything.' When black politicians complain that Giuliani treats them badly, they are right. But Rudy treats all politicians badly. He was never a man in search of advice. 'He is a man of talent, self-confidence and ruthless energy,' said one official still on Giuliani's staff, 'but each of those assets has a flip side. On the other side of the confidence is disdain for others; on the other side of the energy, there's a blind spot'. At the core of the inner sanctum was Giuliani's connection to the outside world, his 'communications director' Chrystine Lategano. She was his shadow, his closest aide. The overt intimacy between the two was brazen and audacious: after spending all day huddled up together in the office, they would adjourn to Cooper's Classic Cigar bar in midtown to continue the never-ending conversation about how to run New York. Donna Hanover - aka Mrs Giuliani - meanwhile kept her maiden name in deed as well as word, hardly ever appearing at official functions and now reported to be living apart from her husband. She even refused to say whether she had voted for him. But even those who worked closely under Giuliani could never prove what happened behind closed doors, and few even want to hypothesise the untold tale of a love affair. 'It is presumed, but not known,' says one former aide. 'It was in the glint of an eye, but no more.' In May last year, Lategano mysteriously quit. The parting was apparently amicable and widely assumed to be a way of fending off the pincer movement of rumour on the one hand and advancing foes on the other. What is astonishing, however, is the contrast between the silent awe at the possibility of Giuliani's affair with Lategano, and the voracious appetite for every detail of the extramarital sex life of Hillary Clinton's husband. When the pool of confidants is a small one, desertion - let alone a brain drain - is a serious matter. One by one, some of the most talented people in City Hall trickled away, cut out of the loop - the artisans of government, the craftsmen and women of civic life. In Lategano's place, Giuliani chose another controversial confidant in Bruce Teitelbaum. Operating as hatchet man, like Giuliani's military wing, Teitelbaum was a faithful pen-pusher in the mayoral campaigns suddenly elevated to become the second most powerful man in the city. And yet Teitelbaum casts his own shadows: he was questioned by the Brooklyn District Attorney this year for connections to an Hassidic Jewish construction consortium associated with the collapse of a building in which two workers were killed. Teitelbaum was said to have fostered special treatment for the company at City Hall in order to maintain good relations with the crucial Jewish community that is said to hold the electoral balance of power in New York. By the start of last year, something was waiting to go wrong for Giuliani. Finally, it happened in the Bronx in February 1999. Four officers from the street crimes unit shot Amadou Diallo, an unarmed, deeply religious, innocent West African street vendor. Giuliani's response to Diallo's death was politically tone-deaf. Which was strange, since his outraged reaction to another police abomination - the torture of a Haitian in policy custody - had been exemplary and prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to call the revolting episode 'Giuliani's finest hour'. Now, he made a series of costly errors. 'Fatally, he presumed he had the family on his side and he did not,' recalls one aide. He said he would 'reserve judgment' on the shooting; he defended the record of the street crimes unit. In the month that followed, his popularity fell by 20 points. Giuliani's enemies were many, but none was more eager to advance against the Mayor than the Rev Al Sharpton, self-appointed leader of the black community. Sharpton needed a break after making a fool of himself in backing a hoax - a woman who said she had been assaulted by the Ku Klux Klan, but had made it up. Now, Sharpton's moment had come and he seized it with relish. From then on, he capitalised on injury to a black community that had benefited most from Giuliani's war on crime, but which now felt itself to be ruled by an army of occupation called the NYPD. The killing of Dorismond last month not only deepened that sentiment but widened it too, calling into the question the mayoralty and character of Giuliani and the price extracted by 'zero tolerance'. Giuliani's reaction to the Dorismond death was so bizarre that even William Bratton, co-architect of zero tolerance, said: 'Like the rest of the New York, I'm appalled. People are beginning to question this guy's judgment.' The late Erik Erikson, Pulitzer Prize-winning psychoanalyst, wrote that great political leaders must be protean to a degree and adopt a range of guises. Thomas Jefferson was Erikson's exemplary specimen and how he would have admired the President named after him, William Jefferson Clinton. And how he would have despaired at Giuliani. 'He strikes me as someone who feels he can shape reality to suit his own interests rather than adjust to it,' said Dr Richard Ulman, a Manhattan psychologist who studies political figures. In this hex, Giuliani becomes his own worst enemy. Because he habitually chooses hubris over contrition, the political complexities of his candidacy get blurred over. He has, actually, taken a moderate stand in many areas of social policy on which he would be required to vote in the Senate and is a downright heretic on such matters as welfare, abortion and gay rights. Only recently has Giuliani had to play at being a partisan Republican, but this he has done with a gusto which may come to haunt him. He has hired the Svengali of direct mailing, Richard Viguerie, to send fusillades of propaganda into the mailboxes of New York. Viguerie is an ideologist of the hard Right, who first practised the art of mass-mailing in the 1960s for the man whom the law student Giuliani passionately loathed, Barry Goldwater. The beneficiaries of his expertise since then have included George Wallace, Oliver North, Jesse Helms and the Rev Sun Il Moon. Giuliani has also accepted free campaign advertising from another right-wing maverick, Howard Ruff, a Utah Mormon with 18 grandchildren who is buying TV time and Netspace to become Hillary Clinton's latest rabid antagonist. 'It's easier to kill a baby snake than a 12-foot king cobra,' ranted Ruff. 'We need to stop this woman.' In this artificially polarised climate, not only do Giuliani's achievements get overlooked, but also the facts about the now accursed NYPD. The reality is that along with crime, police violence in New York is also down to an all-time record low, the force never more disciplined. Fatalities per capita as a result of police guns are way below those of, say, Washington DC, which has a black Mayor. Indeed, the race card too fails to convince, insofar as Giuliani's achievements in New York are rivalled - and probably exceeded - only by those of his opposite number in New Orleans. There, Mayor Marc Morial has deployed an iron fist to punch down crime and murder rates and presided over an extraordinary economic boom. Morial is black; he was a civil rights activist. They even call him the 'black Giuliani' down on the bayou - and that's a compliment. Deep down, New Yorkers know all this when they size up Hillary Clinton's bromide smile against Giuliani's grimace and that is why only a fool or a pollster would dismiss Giuliani at this stage. Either because of or despite the fact that he is the most remarkable politician in America, Giuliani doesn't take much notice of polls - but then nor do most New Yorkers. Even the fact that Giuliani has the political subtlety of a juggernaut without brakes can play to his advantage in this city. A friend of mine - America's leading writer on what propels the intelligent criminal mind - speaks for most of New York when she says: 'I am angry with Giuliani and grateful to him at the same time. Anyone who is honest in this town is torn about Rudy. And knows that we're all in the shitpan when he leaves us. He behaves horribly, but New York behaves horribly. He's our guy, he's an asshole, but he's our asshole'.",

      "body": "<p>One could hardly imagine a more improbable editor for a London newspaper than Max Hastings. His hobbies are shooting and fishing. He commutes from a farmhouse in Berkshire with a proper gun room, and dreams of the salmon rivers of Scotland. He has never willingly spent a weekend in London, except to attend the Countryside March. He doesn't quite wear green wellies to work but his office car is a chauffeur-driven Range Rover. He is six foot five, with a voice pitched to carry across grousemoors. Moreover, he is going deaf from all the shooting, so his bark is getting steadily louder. And yet he also blushes like a schoolgirl. Some of 'the troops' - which is how he refers to his staff - find him terrifying; others find him tactless but kind. </p> <p>He is often referred to as General Hastings (or Hitler Hastings, by Private Eye) - even journalists assume that he has some military background. Actually he doesn't - he toyed with the idea of joining the paras after school and went on a training exercise but acquitted himself so badly that he quietly dropped that ambition. But he made his name as a journalist in the Falklands War. He was the first reporter into Port Stanley where he 'liberated' the Upland Goose pub single-handed. He believes that he owes his whole subsequent career to that one improbable stunt in an improbable war. The other journalists hated him - Michael Nicholson of ITN said that 'He was considered an insufferably pompous, bumptious egoist, which, of course, he was and remains' - but he came back a star. Conrad Black appointed him editor of the Telegraph in 1986, and he turned the moribund, near-bankrupt newspaper into a sleek commercial success. But he was always at odds with Black over politics - Hastings is a left-of-centre One Nation Tory who says he now has no party to vote for - and in 1996 he thankfully moved to the Evening Standard. To his Tory toff friends, it must have seemed a terrible comedown, going from a stately broadsheet much read in the corridors of power, to a scruffy tabloid much read on the Tube, but he admits that money was an incentive - \u00a3400,000 pa instead of \u00a3185,000 - and he was in the middle of a very expensive divorce. </p> <p> So now this man with no stake in London and no very obvious affection for it, runs London's monopoly newspaper (circulation 470,000) with all the power to make or break any candidate in the Mayoral election. It is more power than any editor should have - it is positively indecent. Hastings admits to some unease: 'I don't normally lie awake at nights worrying terribly that something we've done in the newspaper might have terrible effects on the nation because, actually, one of the good things about life is that newspapers have rather less effect than people think. But I do worry about the Mayor because the Evening Standard campaigned for a Mayor for London, and if it's all going to be a disaster, then yes, I will be blushing a bit.' </p> <p>He was blushing furiously at the beginning when Jeffrey Archer was chosen as the Tory candidate. Hastings has always loathed and distrusted Archer and pulled out every possible stop to expose him, sending reporters to investigate the Anglia shares deal, and getting Paul Foot to refresh our memories of his Canadian shoplifting contretemps. But Archer survived the massed guns of the Evening Standard, and was only finally brought down by the sudden exposure of his fake libel alibi. Hastings admits, 'We were as jawdropped as anybody else. At one level I was so relieved. Peter Kellner, our very good political commentator, was always saying, \"Relax, Max, there's no way Archer can win.\" But I used to literally lie awake nights thinking, \"How will I feel if, having been so keen on a Mayor for London, we end up with a complete shyster and I will have helped to bring that about?\" I had all sorts of people, quite intelligent, thoughtful people, coming up to me and saying, \"Why do you keep up this vendetta against poor old Jeffrey? He's not a bad fellow really.\" I was shocked. Yet even now, people still seem willing to eat with him, hobnob with him - it's incredible.' </p> <p>Those same friends, of course, tell him that it will be all his fault if 'that Livingstone' gets in. All his fishing pals, all his shooting cronies, all his chums in the Beefsteak, Brooks's, Pratt's must be snorting through their snifters at the prospect of Red Ken. And then, of course, there's Number 10 constantly complaining about anything it sees as a pro-Livingstone story in the Standard. But Max Hastings has proved steady under fire. As soon as Dobbo was chosen as Labour candidate, the Standard published a poll showing the strength of Livingstone's support, which drew a hail of faxes from Downing Street saying, 'Is Ken Livingstone writing your headlines for you now?' Hastings found it irritating rather than alarming. 'One of the things I love about getting older is that 10 years ago that sort of thing would have rattled me, but nowadays it doesn't bother me a bit.' </p> <p>He has said all along that the Standard will not come out for any candidate until election day. Officially, he remains a sceptic on Livingstone who he first met in 1981, 'I disagree with everything he stands for but he's always good company and he has that quality of mischievous defiance which is always irresistible. Even now, whenever I see him, I tend to grin because it's hard not to like him.' </p> <p>And anyway, he says, 'It would have been a very dull contest without Ken Livingstone. But there's no doubt that the consequences for the Blair government if Livingstone wins are extremely serious. In fact, I think they're a lot more serious for Blair than they are for Londoners.' Livingstone as Mayor can't do too much damage to London (because the Mayor's powers are very limited) but he can provide years of Blair-baiting fun for the Evening Standard. I would be amazed if the paper eventually came out for anyone else. </p> <p>Typically, at the last election, Hastings advised Standard readers to vote Labour, while declaring that he himself would vote Tory because he couldn't support a party that wanted to ban fox-hunting. This rather glaringly illustrated the gulf between him and his readers. But he now seems keen to minimise that gulf, or at least play down his disdain for the City. There is an old and much-loved story that Simon Jenkins, a former editor of the Evening Standard, once insisted on driving Hastings round London on a Sunday to demonstrate that it was still populated at the weekend. Hastings says of course it's not true - but then chortles 'I would have my toenails extracted with redhot pincers rather than spend a Sunday in London. But that doesn't alter the fact that one spent all one's formative years here. I know my way around London inside out and back to front.' </p> <p>Really? So has he been to Hoxton? He thinks so, once, 'about 15 years ago'. The other night his daughter, down from university, demanded that he show her London's celebrity hangouts, so he dutifully dug out his Groucho Club and Met Bar membership cards, unused before, and ventured warily into London's nightlife. But if there were any celebs to be spotted he didn't spot them and he was safely back in bed by midnight. Anyway, he says, he's not going to pretend to be au courant with the clubbing scene - 'I'm not Janet Street-Porter!' - but he goes to the theatre, he goes to restaurants. And he has been on the Tube, last autumn in the rush hour. How did he find it? 'Rather like spending four hours at the Dome, which was probably my worst experience this year. It was horrific. But at least they can't say that one hasn't had a good look.' </p> <p>He says that one thing he shares with Ken Livingstone is that he had a 'London childhood'. I don't imagine Livingstone would see much similarity - Hastings grew up in Rutland Gate, going for walks with his nanny round Kensington Gardens and having food delivered from Harrods. He claims that when he first got a flat, he didn't know you could obtain food any other way, and would place his grocery order with Harrods and wait for the green van (though I think he is winding me up a bit here). He certainly is when he says that one of the major inconveniences of recent years is that he cannot now buy 'so much as a collarstud' from Harrods, since Mohamed Al Fayed became its owner. 'I think Fayed is a bad man. I find it incredible that people cheerfully wander in and out of Harrods buying things and don't appear to care that he is running it.' </p> <p>Hastings is quite strict, even puritanical, about such matters. He wrote a blistering article last November about 'The Friends of Jeffrey Archer'. Hastings believes if someone's a rogue you've got to shun him. He says it sometimes causes awkward moments in his social life, not so much over Archer, as over Jonathan Aitken. 'I always thought Aitken was a bad man, but to this day quite a few friends of mine, people I like and respect, think that he's a fundamentally decent man who's been hard done by. I disagree violently. It's not that one wants anything further awful to happen to him, but I think it is a bit tough if any of us are expected to sit at the same dinner table with him.' </p> <p>He means this literally. A few years ago, he walked out of a country house party - before the shooting! - because his host made an anti-Semitic remark. (Hastings has always been passionately pro-Jewish, long before he married his present wife, Penny, who is Jewish. He often says the world should be run by women and Jews.) Hastings was embarrassed that I knew about the incident and added, 'One is sometimes amazed at how anti-Semitic a chunk of English life still is. Do you find that?' Well yes - but it's precisely the chunk Hastings is normally so enraptured by, the great backwoods landowners with their sporting estates and antediluvian ideas. I'm amazed that he 's amazed to find them making anti-Semitic remarks - it seems to betray an odd naivety. 'Fair point. But I suppose, I've always lived my life in a way between traditional English countryside and the media, and I love both worlds - but, of course, what you end up being is slightly distrusted by both. And in the end you have to say journalists are the most fun - it's such a privilege living and working with clever people, isn't it? I mean I've spent quite long stretches of my life living deep in the country and in the end it does drive you mad because nobody reads at all.' </p> <p>But, of course, he says that to me, a journalist - maybe to his shooting friends he says the opposite. This is the great problem for Hastings-watchers: is he at heart a journalist playing at being a country gentleman, or a country gentleman playing at being a journalist? He was certainly born to be a journalist - his father was Macdonald Hastings, intrepid war correspondent and Special Investigator for Eagle comic; his mother, Anne Scott-James, was a very distinguished columnist. He says he always idolised his father, and was frightened of his mother. 'The irony - which I didn't understand when I was younger but I do now - was that whatever intelligence I have, that has enabled me to bluff my way through journalism all these years, I owe to my mother. My father was a great romantic. His grasp on reality was always rather slender. My mother always used to say he was verging on barking. He had delusions and a grossly exaggerated respect for the landed classes which undoubtedly did influence me when I was younger.' </p> <p>His father went off on mad adventures for Eagle, crossing the Kalahari desert and being cast away on a desert island (he almost died). He was a great hero to schoolboys, which meant that Hastings as a boy 'was teased all the time that the son of the Eagle Special Investigator was a notable coward on the football field.' He describes his schooldays, at Charterhouse, as 'hellish' and adds 'I hope I'm not in the least bitter, but on the other hand, nothing cheers me up more than to kick an Old Carthusian when he's down. It's amazing, the letters I get from people saying, 'Dear Max, don't you remember me from the dear old school? How would you like to come and open my restaurant?' And you say 'Of course I remember you from the dear old school. Last time we met you were holding me against the study fire!' </p> <p>He only 'found himself' when he became a reporter on the Evening Standard and discovered he could write. But in those days he was still eaten up with envy for aristocratic landowners - 'When I was 24, I would have killed to own a castle.' He spent a quarter of his salary every year on renting a shooting lodge in Scotland, so that he could play the laird for a couple of weeks. 'It was a complete fantasy. I mean I loved it but it was completely barking. But I think by the time one was about 40, one had got all this out of one's system. And nowadays, I would say, cross my heart, I'm not jealous of anybody and am aware of how lucky I am - I'm grateful to be blissfully happy.' </p> <p>Much of his happiness comes from his second marriage to Penny Levinson. He first met her when they were both 17 - he was a researcher for the BBC in his gap year before Oxford and she was working in the library. 'I took her out for a while and she recalls with vivid dismay fighting off my beastly advances.' But she went on to marry Michael Grade and he married Patricia Edmondson, a keen fox-hunter, and had three children. When his marriage ended after 20 years, he spent a brief period as a bachelor but didn't exactly make hay: 'I think I once took out a girl quite a bit younger than me, but after dinner she said \"Shall we go dancing?\" and I looked at her in horror, and said \"You must be mad. It's 25 past 10 and I go to bed at half past.\" And I realised then that there was actually no way that one was up for this.' </p> <p>He married Penny quietly in a register office last year with Robert Harris and his wife as witnesses. </p> <p> The Hastings live in a farmhouse near Hungerford, Berkshire, and spend all their weekends gardening. He says that his adventuring, swashbuckling days are behind him - 'One grew up believing that the most important thing in the whole world was to have adventures. But I always had this struggle between being keen on adventures and then being fairly cowardly. I mean if someone had said \"Shoulder to shoulder, Carruthers\" to me, I'd probably have been running before they'd finished the sentence. I did live hard when I was younger, but now I want to be fantastically comfortable.' </p> <p>He hopes to stay at the Evening Standard at least until the next general election but by then he'll be 55 and eligible to retire: 'I do feel that I've been sort of bluffing my way through editing all these years, and I do want to have another life as a writer.' He will write military histories, which he is good at: he has just published an excellent memoir of his war-reporting years called Going to the Wars. He is resigned to not getting a knighthood. When he became editor of the Daily Telegraph, he says, a knighthood almost went with the job, and 'I cannot tell a lie - I really liked the idea very much indeed. But then one of Thatcher's henchmen said to me, \"You do realise, Max, that if you want your knighthood you'll have to be a lot more helpful to the government,\" and I was genuinely rather naively shocked. Then, when John Major became prime minister, one was sort of vaguely wondering, but damn me, then one of his chaps said \"Well, of course, Max if you want a knighthood...\" And I did actually then cross a great thing where I thought: I would love to be given a gong for being a good journalist, but editors don't get gongs for being good journalists, they get them for being helpful to the government of the day, and that is not what we're here for.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "One could hardly imagine a more improbable editor for a London newspaper than Max Hastings. His hobbies are shooting and fishing. He commutes from a farmhouse in Berkshire with a proper gun room, and dreams of the salmon rivers of Scotland. He has never willingly spent a weekend in London, except to attend the Countryside March. He doesn't quite wear green wellies to work but his office car is a chauffeur-driven Range Rover. He is six foot five, with a voice pitched to carry across grousemoors. Moreover, he is going deaf from all the shooting, so his bark is getting steadily louder. And yet he also blushes like a schoolgirl. Some of 'the troops' - which is how he refers to his staff - find him terrifying; others find him tactless but kind. He is often referred to as General Hastings (or Hitler Hastings, by Private Eye) - even journalists assume that he has some military background. Actually he doesn't - he toyed with the idea of joining the paras after school and went on a training exercise but acquitted himself so badly that he quietly dropped that ambition. But he made his name as a journalist in the Falklands War. He was the first reporter into Port Stanley where he 'liberated' the Upland Goose pub single-handed. He believes that he owes his whole subsequent career to that one improbable stunt in an improbable war. The other journalists hated him - Michael Nicholson of ITN said that 'He was considered an insufferably pompous, bumptious egoist, which, of course, he was and remains' - but he came back a star. Conrad Black appointed him editor of the Telegraph in 1986, and he turned the moribund, near-bankrupt newspaper into a sleek commercial success. But he was always at odds with Black over politics - Hastings is a left-of-centre One Nation Tory who says he now has no party to vote for - and in 1996 he thankfully moved to the Evening Standard. To his Tory toff friends, it must have seemed a terrible comedown, going from a stately broadsheet much read in the corridors of power, to a scruffy tabloid much read on the Tube, but he admits that money was an incentive - \u00a3400,000 pa instead of \u00a3185,000 - and he was in the middle of a very expensive divorce. So now this man with no stake in London and no very obvious affection for it, runs London's monopoly newspaper (circulation 470,000) with all the power to make or break any candidate in the Mayoral election. It is more power than any editor should have - it is positively indecent. Hastings admits to some unease: 'I don't normally lie awake at nights worrying terribly that something we've done in the newspaper might have terrible effects on the nation because, actually, one of the good things about life is that newspapers have rather less effect than people think. But I do worry about the Mayor because the Evening Standard campaigned for a Mayor for London, and if it's all going to be a disaster, then yes, I will be blushing a bit.' He was blushing furiously at the beginning when Jeffrey Archer was chosen as the Tory candidate. Hastings has always loathed and distrusted Archer and pulled out every possible stop to expose him, sending reporters to investigate the Anglia shares deal, and getting Paul Foot to refresh our memories of his Canadian shoplifting contretemps. But Archer survived the massed guns of the Evening Standard, and was only finally brought down by the sudden exposure of his fake libel alibi. Hastings admits, 'We were as jawdropped as anybody else. At one level I was so relieved. Peter Kellner, our very good political commentator, was always saying, \"Relax, Max, there's no way Archer can win.\" But I used to literally lie awake nights thinking, \"How will I feel if, having been so keen on a Mayor for London, we end up with a complete shyster and I will have helped to bring that about?\" I had all sorts of people, quite intelligent, thoughtful people, coming up to me and saying, \"Why do you keep up this vendetta against poor old Jeffrey? He's not a bad fellow really.\" I was shocked. Yet even now, people still seem willing to eat with him, hobnob with him - it's incredible.' Those same friends, of course, tell him that it will be all his fault if 'that Livingstone' gets in. All his fishing pals, all his shooting cronies, all his chums in the Beefsteak, Brooks's, Pratt's must be snorting through their snifters at the prospect of Red Ken. And then, of course, there's Number 10 constantly complaining about anything it sees as a pro-Livingstone story in the Standard. But Max Hastings has proved steady under fire. As soon as Dobbo was chosen as Labour candidate, the Standard published a poll showing the strength of Livingstone's support, which drew a hail of faxes from Downing Street saying, 'Is Ken Livingstone writing your headlines for you now?' Hastings found it irritating rather than alarming. 'One of the things I love about getting older is that 10 years ago that sort of thing would have rattled me, but nowadays it doesn't bother me a bit.' He has said all along that the Standard will not come out for any candidate until election day. Officially, he remains a sceptic on Livingstone who he first met in 1981, 'I disagree with everything he stands for but he's always good company and he has that quality of mischievous defiance which is always irresistible. Even now, whenever I see him, I tend to grin because it's hard not to like him.' And anyway, he says, 'It would have been a very dull contest without Ken Livingstone. But there's no doubt that the consequences for the Blair government if Livingstone wins are extremely serious. In fact, I think they're a lot more serious for Blair than they are for Londoners.' Livingstone as Mayor can't do too much damage to London (because the Mayor's powers are very limited) but he can provide years of Blair-baiting fun for the Evening Standard. I would be amazed if the paper eventually came out for anyone else. Typically, at the last election, Hastings advised Standard readers to vote Labour, while declaring that he himself would vote Tory because he couldn't support a party that wanted to ban fox-hunting.

      "body": "<p>Madonna, Kevin Spacey, Kathleen Turner... these days you can hardly move in London without bumping into Hollywood. The fashionable cosmopolitanism of today's capital has brought the stars flocking to Malibu-by-the-Thames, as the Notting Hill-Chelsea strip is bound to become known. The buzz of street markets with yam and plantain on the stall, the sound of drum'n'bass from the oversized car speakers at the traffic lights, and the smell of coriander wafting from the neighbour's kitchen have become part of the signature of this new London. But diversity wasn't always such a big draw.</p> <p>In the 12th century, the monk Richard of Devizes spelled out a bloodcurdling warning to travellers heading for London. 'Each race brings its own vices and its own customs to the city,' he wrote. 'Jesters, smooth-skinned lads, Moors, flatterers, pretty boys, effeminates, pederasts, singing and dancing girls, quacks, belly-dancers, sorceresses, extortionists, night-wanderers, magicians, mimes, beggars, buffoons - all this tribe fill all the houses... Therefore if you do not want to dwell with evil-doers, do not live in London.'</p> <p>Today the very reasons that so repelled the old friar are exactly the reasons that draw more than 14 million visitors from abroad each year. The excitement, the diversity, the edge of danger in a great capital city are special. No matter how many episodes of The Bill you watch from the armchair of your country seat, the energy, the hum of London's streets cannot be replicated. It is the sound of a hundred cultures softly clashing, sometimes melding, occasionally grating uncomfortably. Today more than 50 distinct ethnic communities thrive in London; a visitor from virtually anywhere will find a familiar smile.</p> <p>This is a different London to the one into which I was born. My parents came from a small village on the Atlantic coast. The capital of Guyana used to be a beautiful garden city, with canals laid out by 17th-century Dutch settlers, flowering bushes, and a climate with only two variations: warm and dry, and warm and wet. It was a kind of tropical paradise. But there's a problem with paradise. It can be boring and tetchy. In a country the size of England and Wales, a population of less than 1 million should have enough room for everyone. My parents came here partly to escape the oppressiveness of small-town life. They certainly didn't travel thousands of miles for an improved lifestyle. In the grey London of the 50s, there was little comfort to be had - two rooms and six children is an uncomfortable way to learn long division.</p> <p>But like most, they found adventure in the big city. And in turn they gave it colour, music, noise and fun. The ethnic mix in London has transformed some traditional institutions. Superstores and out-of-town shopping have destroyed many of London's high streets and markets. Where they survive, they do so because new communities have recreated them in their own images. Bangladeshis in Brick Lane, Gujuratis in Wembley, the Chinese in Gerrard Street, Caribbeans in Brixton, Africans in Harlesden, and the Cypriots in Green Lanes have revived Sunday shopping as a recreational activity. The discreet harvest festivals and genteel hymns of the postwar Church of England have been transformed into the riot of sound and colour wrought by Hindus, Moslems, Pentecostalists and Sikhs.</p> <p>But there is another, more subtle quality that London has shown through two millennia that other great metropolises do not share. It is the fact that anyone can become a Londoner. We can, within a single generation, throw off the shackles of the past without losing the link to our heritage.</p> <p>Think of George Michael, or Frank Bruno. Each is the son of immigrants, yet each is unmistakably a Londoner. And unlike the other great cosmopolitan metropolis of New York, Londoners do not hang on to their past heritage. That doesn't mean there are no racial problems or conflict. But in London, the friction is less neighbour against neighbour, and more minorities against the system. You could sit for a week with any black or Asian family and not reach the end of the list of injustices perpetrated by the police, schools, churches, local councils, banks or any other authority figure.</p> <p>But things have changed from the days when Caribbean immigrants were warned by their landladies to leave home early and return late so the neighbours did not see them. Surveys show that the number of 'white' Londoners who object to having black or Asian neighbours has fallen steadily for decades; intermarriage is on a scale that would make Americans' eyes pop.</p> <p>London is not a melting pot.

      "bodyText": "Madonna, Kevin Spacey, Kathleen Turner... these days you can hardly move in London without bumping into Hollywood. The fashionable cosmopolitanism of today's capital has brought the stars flocking to Malibu-by-the-Thames, as the Notting Hill-Chelsea strip is bound to become known. The buzz of street markets with yam and plantain on the stall, the sound of drum'n'bass from the oversized car speakers at the traffic lights, and the smell of coriander wafting from the neighbour's kitchen have become part of the signature of this new London. But diversity wasn't always such a big draw. In the 12th century, the monk Richard of Devizes spelled out a bloodcurdling warning to travellers heading for London. 'Each race brings its own vices and its own customs to the city,' he wrote. 'Jesters, smooth-skinned lads, Moors, flatterers, pretty boys, effeminates, pederasts, singing and dancing girls, quacks, belly-dancers, sorceresses, extortionists, night-wanderers, magicians, mimes, beggars, buffoons - all this tribe fill all the houses... Therefore if you do not want to dwell with evil-doers, do not live in London.' Today the very reasons that so repelled the old friar are exactly the reasons that draw more than 14 million visitors from abroad each year. The excitement, the diversity, the edge of danger in a great capital city are special. No matter how many episodes of The Bill you watch from the armchair of your country seat, the energy, the hum of London's streets cannot be replicated. It is the sound of a hundred cultures softly clashing, sometimes melding, occasionally grating uncomfortably. Today more than 50 distinct ethnic communities thrive in London; a visitor from virtually anywhere will find a familiar smile. This is a different London to the one into which I was born. My parents came from a small village on the Atlantic coast. The capital of Guyana used to be a beautiful garden city, with canals laid out by 17th-century Dutch settlers, flowering bushes, and a climate with only two variations: warm and dry, and warm and wet. It was a kind of tropical paradise. But there's a problem with paradise. It can be boring and tetchy. In a country the size of England and Wales, a population of less than 1 million should have enough room for everyone. My parents came here partly to escape the oppressiveness of small-town life. They certainly didn't travel thousands of miles for an improved lifestyle. In the grey London of the 50s, there was little comfort to be had - two rooms and six children is an uncomfortable way to learn long division. But like most, they found adventure in the big city. And in turn they gave it colour, music, noise and fun. The ethnic mix in London has transformed some traditional institutions. Superstores and out-of-town shopping have destroyed many of London's high streets and markets. Where they survive, they do so because new communities have recreated them in their own images. Bangladeshis in Brick Lane, Gujuratis in Wembley, the Chinese in Gerrard Street, Caribbeans in Brixton, Africans in Harlesden, and the Cypriots in Green Lanes have revived Sunday shopping as a recreational activity. The discreet harvest festivals and genteel hymns of the postwar Church of England have been transformed into the riot of sound and colour wrought by Hindus, Moslems, Pentecostalists and Sikhs. But there is another, more subtle quality that London has shown through two millennia that other great metropolises do not share. It is the fact that anyone can become a Londoner. We can, within a single generation, throw off the shackles of the past without losing the link to our heritage. Think of George Michael, or Frank Bruno. Each is the son of immigrants, yet each is unmistakably a Londoner. And unlike the other great cosmopolitan metropolis of New York, Londoners do not hang on to their past heritage. That doesn't mean there are no racial problems or conflict. But in London, the friction is less neighbour against neighbour, and more minorities against the system. You could sit for a week with any black or Asian family and not reach the end of the list of injustices perpetrated by the police, schools, churches, local councils, banks or any other authority figure. But things have changed from the days when Caribbean immigrants were warned by their landladies to leave home early and return late so the neighbours did not see them. Surveys show that the number of 'white' Londoners who object to having black or Asian neighbours has fallen steadily for decades; intermarriage is on a scale that would make Americans' eyes pop. London is not a melting pot. The loss of identity is not an option for young Londoners - my children's generation have no doubts about their heritage and they won't give it up easily. But that does not mean a retreat to the ghetto. Young Londoners have found ways of sharing their heritage with their friends that my generation never managed. One colleague told me a few years ago that he had to change his frame of reference when walking behind a group of teenagers: so mixed were their styles, ways of walking and talking, he had to get in front of them to discover who was white and who black. London is on the verge of doing what every great world city has tried for in vain for three millennia - to welcome all comers and embrace them with ease and comfort. That is, after all, the ideal of the city, the brilliant crossroads where all talents meet. In a century when most of humankind will need to find a new path to urban life, London is showing the way.",

Why do we paltry wage slaves collude in a work, work, work culture whose only result - apart from 20 per cent lower productivity than any other country in Europe - is bad sex and bad lives?</p> <p>The answer is simple: 21st-century sex has become synonymous with anxiety, and work is our only legitimate escape. For single women, spending hours at the office means you have no resources left to worry about your crap sex life. There's no time to think about why you're not conforming to the spooky, instantly up-for-it sexual arousal typified by Demi Moore circa 1994.</p> <p>For men, work is a holiday from performance worries. Every bird they meet is 'sexually literate'. Egged on by how-to articles in women's glossies, she thinks she has a goddess-given right to sexual satisfaction.

And sexual boredom, as we all know, is less acceptable than herpes. 'Nobody dares admit to being sexually bored, because it makes them question their own performance or their love for their partner,' says Aneta Joiner, a PhD student at London's Southbank University who's researching the subject.</p> <p>Of course, sexual boredom is nothing new. But the way we think about it is. We believe that our sexual desire has to be focused intensely on one person: our partner. Although it's unrealistic to expect mind-blowing desire to well up for this person the statutory three times a week, we still do. Furthermore, we think that being sexually bored with our partner means we don't love them, which of course means we should leave. 'We're working too hard for sex' has become our safety valve, not just a justification for our deprived lives but also a palatable way to avoid divorce.</p> <p>All the sex therapists I spoke to agreed that, if you want to do it, you'll find the time (just look at Tony Blair). And if you don't? 'It's a serious signal,' says psychotherapist Professor Petruska Clarkson. Sexual boredom has been related to depression, hopelessness, anxiety, loneliness, hostility and impulsiveness, and correlated to drug use, eating disorders, job dissatisfaction and having unprotected sex. Whereas good sex has multiple benefits. As well as being, as Clarkson puts it, 'a mutual artwork - a way to be creative in a world that can be hostile and exhausting,' it keeps people healthier longer, builds love, trust and communication, keeps marriages together and provides a good, healthy, sensual atmosphere for children to grow up in.</p> <p>Since nobody has yet come up with a blueprint for a relationship which would alleviate sexual boredom (affairs don't work - we tend to marry them), we need practical coping strategies. First, we must ditch our unrealistic ideas about romance and the ever-ready flame of sexual desire. 'Spontaneous sex is a fallacy,' insists Clarkson. Rampant sexual excitement doesn't just rise up on the sofa after Match of the Day, you know. It takes time and planning, the kind of attention you would have given it in the early days of romance.</p> <p>Secondly, we must chill out. 'Being sexually bored with someone doesn't mean you don't love them,' says Aneta Joiner. In her work with gay and straight couples, she's found that those who don't get bored tend to have high life satisfaction but also, more importantly, they fantasise regularly about other people. They also have an arsenal of erotic strategies, including: the communication of erotic ideas, the use of pornographic material and sex toys, masturbation, romantic intimacy, infidelity and flirting with others.</p> <p>So that Prada wolfskin might come in handy after all. And if you can't get home any earlier, there's no excuse for not fantasising while at work. It's a long way from the puritan work ethic, but it may save your marriage.

      "body": "<b> The bus driver</b> <p>Denzil 'Scotty' Scott was recruited in Barbados by London Transport in 1962, when he was 20. He began driving a Routemaster bus in 1970, and is still driving a Routemaster today </p> <p>\u0095 I decided to give it a go because a lot of my mates that I used to hang around with joined the scheme. The first route I did was the 41. At that time, it used to go down to the Victoria and Albert Docks from Archway. Now it only goes from Tottenham Hale to Archway. That was a nice route to go on. It had some really friendly people, like the dockers. Things were more friendly then: around Christmas time, you used to get so many little gifts and people would always be singing on the bus. I don't know what people are eating now, but everyone seems to want to fight. You can't talk to anyone on the bus nowadays - they just stare at you. My favourite route is the 41, because I have been doing it for so many years. When my family comes over from Barbados, the first place they ask about is Madam Tussaud's. But I take them to see St Paul's and the Tower of London. I love London. I live in Tottenham, just up the road from this garage, and this is my favourite area. I have looked at other garages like Peckham, Catford, Woolwich, and I didn't like them. I have always been here and everyone knows me. Why go somewhere where you're not known?</p> <p><b>The eco-activist</b></p> <p>Simon Gould, decorator and Free Tibet campaigner, lives in Chalk Farm and has meditated outside the Chinese Embassy every Wednesday evening for the past 10 years </p> <p>\u0095 I totally got rid of the Tube from my life when I was bringing up my son, J. I have gone everywhere by bike ever since. The London you see by bike is a totally different London. By bike you can decide to go to the Natural History Museum and just spend 20 minutes in it, because the journey is part of the enjoyment. We used to go three times a week, when it was free. </p> <p>Since 1994, I've turned up at more than 50 Critical Masses and two Reclaim the Streets demonstrations. I just want an improvement in London, it doesn't matter what the ideology is, really. Not any more. </p> <p>I spend more time at the Chinese Embassy, in Portland Place near Regent's Park, than anywhere else. Since 1989, I have been there 400, 500 times, so I suppose it is a bit like my local pub. I admit that it is actually a social gathering. </p> <p>I hate the pollarded trees in London. I find it very unpleasant to cycle down a street and see branches that appear like supplicants' arms, chopped off and mutilated as if in the very act of asking for our assistance. It is just done for the traffic. </p> <p>Traffic does rule London. I have even been arrested for standing still in the road. That was about six months before Jiang Zemin's visit, on a march where the police had said suddenly that nobody was allowed to stand still as they passed the Chinese Embassy. So it was 'obstruction of the highway, method used: stood still'. </p> <p>I don't have a love affair with London, but the Tibet vigil is the most important thing I do, and it does define my London. I seem to be fated to be here, and I embrace that.</p> <p><b>The socialite</b></p> <p>Lady Victoria Hervey, model, aristocrat and now shopkeeper, runs Belgravia boutique Akademi with partner Jayne Blight </p> <p>\u0095 The shop was originally going to be on Chelsea Green, behind Fulham Road, but we didn't think that road was going to be fashionable enough. We decided on Motcomb Street because Jimmy Choo is here and it is a bit more exclusive. </p> <p>I love New York, but I wouldn't want to live there. Paris is too arrogant and Milan is too much of an industrial place. London is more like a village. If New York is a loft apartment, then London is a cottage. </p> <p>I grew up in the south of France and moved to London when I was about 12, but it is only in the last four years that I have felt more at home here. </p> <p>Usually I just go out between King's Road, Fulham Road and Brompton Road. Momo's is one of my favourite places, and Woody's in Notting Hill. It is always full of my sort of people: photographers and models. We do a lot of business in Clerkenwell because many of the designers have showrooms down there, but it seems like miles away. </p> <p>Places I hate: Leicester Square. Brixton. Daphne's. I have been to a lot of places I hate, I've even been on castings in E17 before: that is the furthest I've trekked. Never again.</p> <p><b>The policeman</b></p> <p>Chief Inspector Chris Bradford was born in Greenwich and joined the Metropolitan Police 27 years ago, when he was 19. He currently works in the Vice Unit, based in Charing Cross Road </p> <p>\u0095 I have moved around London, but I always come back to the centre. There is a draw about the West End. I still like the bright lights. It's the adrenaline and the challenges. If anything happens in London, it's always front-page news. At the Downing Street mortar bombing, I was the Incident Officer because I happened to be there at the time. I can look back on that and know I was a part of it. </p> <p>The vice department brings together the licensing unit for clubs, and the vice units. We look at organised prostitution, the trafficking of women, violence, coercion, juvenile crime. We might tackle street prostitutes one week and kerb-crawlers the next, so we are seen to be fair. </p> <p>I am not a very emotional person. I was relatively unemotional when I came into the service and I have only compounded it now. You come across quite horrific offences and for me, personally, it is water off a duck's back. You've got to deal with it and I am very fortunate in that I have never been affected. </p> <p>But I don't think London is good place to bring up children. Definitely not: I'm encouraging mine to go. Why? Because I'm jaundiced. I go to Leicester Square at 2am and although I don't feel personally threatened, it is a threatening environment. You can see the different gangs of thieves operating. </p> <p>One example of our relationship with the community is Operation Malachite, which concentrates on brothels and prostitution. These girls are our community and they are entitled to just as much protection as anyone. We make a point of going round to what we call walk-up flats, for instance in Berwick Street, and speaking to the girls. Quite naturally they attract strange individuals. They get to know our faces and they begin to tell us all sorts of things, for instance if anyone is asking for strange perversions and that information goes into our database. We police the community, but it's not about kicking doors in.</p> <p><b>The PR</b></p> <p>Joanne Asquith, 33, runs her own fashion PR company, CPR, and lives in Primrose Hill with her two children </p> <p>\u0095 I haven't always lived in London. My parents are from London, and they moved out into Kent, where I was born. I ran away to London for a couple of days when I was 16, and I moved back to London as soon as my parents let me, which was when I was 17. I have worked in fashion since leaving school and my first job was in this dynamic young fashion company in Covent Garden. London was all glamour and excitement and sex and, drugs and rock'n'roll. Bright lights, big city, fast living.</p> <p>That's all I was interested in when I was at 17. Now, I can't stand any of that: for me, it's about earning enough money to look after my children and have decent holidays and nice houses. </p> <p>London is really hard work. You have to do the legwork and the networking. London can be shallow and fickle, and you've got to be competitive. </p> <p>There's a part of me that thinks London looks amazing. When I come over Waterloo Bridge, London looks quite majestic. Obviously, I don't think it's majestic in Peckham, but I love the opulence around Chelsea and Mayfair. I am always proud to say I live in London. </p> <p>I hate Notting Hill. Portobello Road is a dump, and for some reason people think it's cool and trendy. Soho is awful, although in the 80s it was glamourous. It has become seedy and sleazy and there are no nice shops, except Agent Provocateur. The restaurants are all crap. It's just another con. </p> <p>I never used to like west London much, but Knightsbridge is lovely, and Kensington and Chelsea. It is civilised and quiet. Kensington Place, off Kensington Church Street, has beautiful shops. The quaint streets don't go anywhere but just have beautiful houses covered in wisteria. It's a little jewel. You can meander through Regent's Park, with its wonderful flower gardens. I love all the parks in London. And I used to spend a lot of time on the river when I was a child - we'd chug up and down the Thames every weekend on our boat. </p> <p>I have a million ideas a day, and I motor ahead - I wouldn't get inspired if I wasn't in London. There are brilliant opportunities. And I haven't exhausted my supply of ideas and energy yet.</p> <p><b>The refugee</b></p> <p>Dr Arumugam Visagaratnam, a Tamil refugee, lives in south London. He is 75 </p> <p>\u0095 I came to London in 1993. I had to flee from Sri Lanka to save my life and my family got scattered. I have eight children and they fled to France, Canada and Britain long before I left. We went to my daughter's house in Wimbledon. I don't remember my first impressions - I was not in the mood to think about my environment or anything else. My wife had left Sri Lanka before me, so I did not know her whereabouts. I was worried, but then I found out she had arrived, and when I saw her I forgot everything. My family did not let me leave my daughter's house for about 10 days, I was like a man under house-arrest. </p> <p>I have a lot of friends and I am the vice-president of the South London Tamil Welfare Group and through that association we do a lot of things: we have a social group for the elderly and a women's front and we do a lot of cultural work. Every fortnight, we have a get together and there is a coffee morning on Mondays. From time to time, we go on pleasure trips to temples. Recently we went to the Millennium Dome. I did not appreciate it very much: you can enjoy that type of thing only up to a certain age. </p> <p>It is not always easy in London, but we hear that there are also problems with racism in other European countries. Once my wife and I were walking along the street and there was a group of young people. As they passed one boy spat on my wife so I got annoyed. But what can we do? There are good and bad people everywhere. </p> <p>The truth is that we are waiting for the first opportunity to leave this country. I have peace of mind in London, but I want to see Sri Lanka again before I die.</p> <p><b>The nightworker</b></p> <p>Arthur Zielinski has been a Noise Abatement Officer for Westminster Council for eight years. His night shift is from 10pm to 7am</p> <p>\u0095 In the past 25 years, the night scene has changed substantially. I know Westminster extremely well, every street, although not quite every brick. It has a nice cosmopolitan feel: you get everybody from dukes to dustmen. </p> <p>I have lived in Sydenham, south London, for most of my life and I suppose I am that rare breed, a secret admirer of south London. The place is deeply unfashionable and you can't get a cab home, but that is part of the excitement. </p> <p>People seem to change at night. Many people feel freer. Alcohol and other chemicals also have a peripheral role. Some of the most objectionable and verbally abusive people, on a regular basis, are educated middle-class people. If they are usually quite powerful, they may feel humiliated. </p> <p>I like being called out to Old Compton Street, because it is always lively. It is a convergence for a lot of cultures. There is the Italian thing, the gay thing, the Chinese thing, the club thing, the showbiz thing. Purely on a people-watching basis it is an interesting place. Millbank, for instance, is dead. </p> <p>Also, at four in the morning after it has been raining heavily and there is a breeze blowing in from the countryside, you actually smell the countryside. And the air is fresh.</p> <p><b>The drug dealer</b></p> <p>Maurice lives and works in London</p> <p>\u0095 I was brought up in east London and I bought my first kilo of hash when I was 17. I sold hash for about 10 years and then, through the lifestyle I was in, I started taking coke and heroin. So I started selling coke and heroin. Once I started smoking and injecting coke, the clientele completely changed. Then, of course, I changed. But I looked on it as a business to supplement my habit. It became a necessity. The lifestyle led you back on to the streets, which is where I first started, smoking dope. I just progressed to selling heroin in blocks of flats. </p> <p>Until you got aggravation or trouble, or arrested by the police, you would work a particular area. There were times when I was serving heroin where one minute I'd be serving in a block of flats in Walford, the next minute I'd be serving in Deptford, and then three months later in Muswell Hill and Kentish Town. You'd sell wherever you were living. </p> <p>I'd always be on guard. I moved to Portobello Road and served drugs there for five years. Before that, I'd been OK. But when I went into that lifestyle, I saw a side of Notting Hill I'd never experienced before. I'd always thought of it as being quite trendy - lots of nice bars, the market. But there is a completely different side to the relaxed, bohemian Notting Hill. When you go into the drug cultures in those areas, people are not smoking dope, they're not going out and drinking champagne. They are smoking crack every day, taking heroin, taking different sleeping pills. It is a really dark place to be. </p> <p>I'd done quite well, I had two business, and, all of a sudden, I was on the street hustling, looking for someone to buy crack at three, four, five in the morning and meeting people in cars. They say all types of people live in Notting Hill, and they do. You sleep during the day, you live by night. </p> <p>Fear is what I feel most about London. I've seen what a lovely city London is and the freedom that we have, but it instils a lot of fear into you to see the other side: the night owls and crack houses. </p> <p>I love London, but there is a big focus on materialism, status and money. There is a lot of pressure to earn money, and you need to earn a lot of money to live in London. </p> <p>I loved living in Notting Hill for a time. But once I started selling drugs and got into its drug culture, I despised the area. If you offered me a free flat, now, to live off Portobello Road, I'd say no. I have too many bad memories: I saw the dark side. I became a prisoner of Notting Hill. I have no problems with Battersea, or Kensington, or Chelsea, but as I go further west and further east I have bad associations with Hoxton, with Bethnal Green, Hackney, all through selling drugs. </p> <p>I see myself continuing to live in London, but not through choice. I have no real ties here, and not much loyalty to London. But I have lived here all my life. It's like a marriage, like a love-hate relationship.</p> <p><b>The head teacher</b></p> <p>Linette Seath, headmistress, taught at Stockwell Primary School for 26 years and retired last week. She lives in Streatham </p> <p>\u0095 When I first started at the school, in 1972, the children were predominantly Afro-Caribbean, with a few from Nigeria and some from Ghana. Over the years, we got more and more from different countries, even to the extent of having one child whose mother is from Finland. We have got some South American children, but we don't have many refugees from Kosovo at the moment. People from the Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea came over when the famine and war first started. I think Brixton has always welcomed people from other nations who are having difficulties, and over the years the population has changed quite a bit. </p> <p>There is quite a community here and there are some long-established families. We get children coming back whose parents went to the school. It is friendly and very supportive and that is one of the reasons I have stayed here. Most of the time, it has been happy. You get occasional glitches: people do come in and let off steam, but it is usually about social things like housing, not the school. At least they know that they can come and ask for advice, especially if they don't speak English well. </p> <p>As I retire, we shall probably move out of London, and I shall really miss the mix of people that there are here. But Brixton is perhaps a place for young people. It has changed a lot recently - housing in some parts of Brixton is really expensive now. A lot of my teachers are finding it very difficult to afford housing. </p> <p>The largest social change in the area, over the years, has been drugs. The estate across the road used to be an intimidating place to visit. You can still see people openly doing deals. The Jamaican population has always smoked ganja, but it is the syringes that are far more worrying.</p> <p><b>The chef</b></p> <p>Margot Henderson, moved to London from New Zealand, in 1985. She runs The French House restaurant in Soho and lives in Covent Garden with her husband Fergus and three children </p> <p>\u0095 I came to London for love. Perhaps that is an unusual reason to travel halfway around the world, but I also wanted to see Big Ben. I love London. I love the size of it, the massive scale, and all the foreigners. Thank God for the foreigners! Where would London be without them? </p> <p>London is exciting for parents: you don't get suburban neuroses and your friends pop round more frequently. It's very sociable in Covent Garden - walk out in the streets and you know people. Soho is similar: people go to Bar Italia, the little shops, Berwick Street market. I like the mix of so many different people constantly coming and going, tourists and working people. It's a mess - a good, happy mess. </p> <p>Soho, Fitzrovia, they're just like villages squished together. London is expensive: property's expensive, fun's expensive, alcohol's expensive, everything's expensive. Sometimes I feel it is a huge struggle, and I am just fighting against everything. But in the end, we have made our lives here. I have had so much fun: I've done well, enjoyed my restaurant, enjoyed cooking here. Even though I think London can feel a bit snooty and alienating sometimes, it is really quite a friendly place, and you've just got to go for it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The bus driver Denzil 'Scotty' Scott was recruited in Barbados by London Transport in 1962, when he was 20. He began driving a Routemaster bus in 1970, and is still driving a Routemaster today \u0095 I decided to give it a go because a lot of my mates that I used to hang around with joined the scheme. The first route I did was the 41. At that time, it used to go down to the Victoria and Albert Docks from Archway. Now it only goes from Tottenham Hale to Archway. That was a nice route to go on. It had some really friendly people, like the dockers. Things were more friendly then: around Christmas time, you used to get so many little gifts and people would always be singing on the bus. I don't know what people are eating now, but everyone seems to want to fight. You can't talk to anyone on the bus nowadays - they just stare at you. My favourite route is the 41, because I have been doing it for so many years. When my family comes over from Barbados, the first place they ask about is Madam Tussaud's. But I take them to see St Paul's and the Tower of London. I love London. I live in Tottenham, just up the road from this garage, and this is my favourite area. I have looked at other garages like Peckham, Catford, Woolwich, and I didn't like them. I have always been here and everyone knows me. Why go somewhere where you're not known? The eco-activist Simon Gould, decorator and Free Tibet campaigner, lives in Chalk Farm and has meditated outside the Chinese Embassy every Wednesday evening for the past 10 years \u0095 I totally got rid of the Tube from my life when I was bringing up my son, J. I have gone everywhere by bike ever since. The London you see by bike is a totally different London. By bike you can decide to go to the Natural History Museum and just spend 20 minutes in it, because the journey is part of the enjoyment. We used to go three times a week, when it was free. Since 1994, I've turned up at more than 50 Critical Masses and two Reclaim the Streets demonstrations. I just want an improvement in London, it doesn't matter what the ideology is, really. Not any more. I spend more time at the Chinese Embassy, in Portland Place near Regent's Park, than anywhere else. Since 1989, I have been there 400, 500 times, so I suppose it is a bit like my local pub. I admit that it is actually a social gathering. I hate the pollarded trees in London. I find it very unpleasant to cycle down a street and see branches that appear like supplicants' arms, chopped off and mutilated as if in the very act of asking for our assistance. It is just done for the traffic. Traffic does rule London. I have even been arrested for standing still in the road. That was about six months before Jiang Zemin's visit, on a march where the police had said suddenly that nobody was allowed to stand still as they passed the Chinese Embassy. So it was 'obstruction of the highway, method used: stood still'. I don't have a love affair with London, but the Tibet vigil is the most important thing I do, and it does define my London. I seem to be fated to be here, and I embrace that. The socialite Lady Victoria Hervey, model, aristocrat and now shopkeeper, runs Belgravia boutique Akademi with partner Jayne Blight \u0095 The shop was originally going to be on Chelsea Green, behind Fulham Road, but we didn't think that road was going to be fashionable enough. We decided on Motcomb Street because Jimmy Choo is here and it is a bit more exclusive. I love New York, but I wouldn't want to live there. Paris is too arrogant and Milan is too much of an industrial place. London is more like a village. If New York is a loft apartment, then London is a cottage. I grew up in the south of France and moved to London when I was about 12, but it is only in the last four years that I have felt more at home here. Usually I just go out between King's Road, Fulham Road and Brompton Road. Momo's is one of my favourite places, and Woody's in Notting Hill. It is always full of my sort of people: photographers and models. We do a lot of business in Clerkenwell because many of the designers have showrooms down there, but it seems like miles away. Places I hate: Leicester Square. Brixton. Daphne's. I have been to a lot of places I hate, I've even been on castings in E17 before: that is the furthest I've trekked. Never again. The policeman Chief Inspector Chris Bradford was born in Greenwich and joined the Metropolitan Police 27 years ago, when he was 19. He currently works in the Vice Unit, based in Charing Cross Road \u0095 I have moved around London, but I always come back to the centre. There is a draw about the West End. I still like the bright lights. It's the adrenaline and the challenges. If anything happens in London, it's always front-page news. At the Downing Street mortar bombing, I was the Incident Officer because I happened to be there at the time. I can look back on that and know I was a part of it. The vice department brings together the licensing unit for clubs, and the vice units. We look at organised prostitution, the trafficking of women, violence, coercion, juvenile crime. We might tackle street prostitutes one week and kerb-crawlers the next, so we are seen to be fair. I am not a very emotional person. I was relatively unemotional when I came into the service and I have only compounded it now. You come across quite horrific offences and for me, personally, it is water off a duck's back. You've got to deal with it and I am very fortunate in that I have never been affected. But I don't think London is good place to bring up children. Definitely not: I'm encouraging mine to go. Why? Because I'm jaundiced. I go to Leicester Square at 2am and although I don't feel personally threatened, it is a threatening environment. You can see the different gangs of thieves operating. One example of our relationship with the community is Operation Malachite, which concentrates on brothels and prostitution. These girls are our community and they are entitled to just as much protection as anyone. We make a point of going round to what we call walk-up flats, for instance in Berwick Street, and speaking to the girls. Quite naturally they attract strange individuals. They get to know our faces and they begin to tell us all sorts of things, for instance if anyone is asking for strange perversions and that information goes into our database. We police the community, but it's not about kicking doors in. The PR Joanne Asquith, 33, runs her own fashion PR company, CPR, and lives in Primrose Hill with her two children \u0095 I haven't always lived in London. My parents are from London, and they moved out into Kent, where I was born. I ran away to London for a couple of days when I was 16, and I moved back to London as soon as my parents let me, which was when I was 17. I have worked in fashion since leaving school and my first job was in this dynamic young fashion company in Covent Garden. London was all glamour and excitement and sex and, drugs and rock'n'roll. Bright lights, big city, fast living. That's all I was interested in when I was at 17. Now, I can't stand any of that: for me, it's about earning enough money to look after my children and have decent holidays and nice houses. London is really hard work. You have to do the legwork and the networking. London can be shallow and fickle, and you've got to be competitive. There's a part of me that thinks London looks amazing. When I come over Waterloo Bridge, London looks quite majestic. Obviously, I don't think it's majestic in Peckham, but I love the opulence around Chelsea and Mayfair. I am always proud to say I live in London. I hate Notting Hill. Portobello Road is a dump, and for some reason people think it's cool and trendy. Soho is awful, although in the 80s it was glamourous. It has become seedy and sleazy and there are no nice shops, except Agent Provocateur. The restaurants are all crap. It's just another con. I never used to like west London much, but Knightsbridge is lovely, and Kensington and Chelsea. It is civilised and quiet. Kensington Place, off Kensington Church Street, has beautiful shops. The quaint streets don't go anywhere but just have beautiful houses covered in wisteria. It's a little jewel. You can meander through Regent's Park, with its wonderful flower gardens. I love all the parks in London. And I used to spend a lot of time on the river when I was a child - we'd chug up and down the Thames every weekend on our boat. I have a million ideas a day, and I motor ahead - I wouldn't get inspired if I wasn't in London. There are brilliant opportunities. And I haven't exhausted my supply of ideas and energy yet. The refugee Dr Arumugam Visagaratnam, a Tamil refugee, lives in south London. He is 75 \u0095 I came to London in 1993. I had to flee from Sri Lanka to save my life and my family got scattered. I have eight children and they fled to France, Canada and Britain long before I left. We went to my daughter's house in Wimbledon. I don't remember my first impressions - I was not in the mood to think about my environment or anything else. My wife had left Sri Lanka before me, so I did not know her whereabouts.

      "body": "<p> Let me introduce you to Turner. He's a cop on the edge. His boss hates him and his wife hasn't spoken to him in a civil tone since he began an intense relationship with a certain Jack Daniel's. He is investigating a baffling murder/heist/disappearance. Unfortunately, he seems unlikely to solve it since his life is heading towards a tragedy of Rikki Lake proportions. He lives in New York or another city where it often rains. </p> <p>Stop me if this sounds familiar. And yet there is something marvellous about a top-notch, formulaic thriller, if you get it right. Of course there are crime movies told from the point of view of robbers, gangsters, serial killers and other undesirable antiheroes, but there is a pleasing symmetry in the cop-versus-bad-guy scenario. Even though our man Turner isn't exactly a candidate for sainthood. </p> <p>That's why you need the right actor to play him. He's a bit of a rebel with a shady past and an uncertain future. He only smiles in the presence of a bartender and only then with wry detachment. Hugh Grant need not apply. In fact, all the obvious choices are either dead - Bogart, McQueen, Mitchum - or too old to chase punks through the subway; sorry Nicholson, Eastwood and De Niro. Harvey Keitel would be fine but he can't be trusted to keep his trousers on. Russell Crowe was excellent as the tortured officer in LA Confidential. He'll do. </p> <p>Then there's the long-suffering wife. Her scenes will mainly consist of venting self-righteous rage at her errant husband and hanging around their surprisingly upmarket apartment in a designer negligee. In the last half-hour she will reveal a devastating secret which throws our increasingly resourceful hero off-kilter. Meryl Streep's agent isn't likely to call, but Salma Hayek's may. And the main villain? He must be British. There should also be a femme fatale. She needs an icy demeanour and hair colour that contrasts with the protagonist's wife. </p> <p>The plot will be an intriguing mix of corruption, sleaze and miscellaneous human detritus, taking increasingly beguiling twists. Hint: no one can be trusted. But the plot turns can't be too jaw-droppingly unexpected. There is a fine line between silly (Basic Instinct) and sublime (Chinatown). </p> <p>Finally, you need to hire a director. That's often the most difficult decision, but since all the right elements are in place this soon-to-be classic will virtually direct itself. So, sit back, relax and put a call in to Michael Winner.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Let me introduce you to Turner. He's a cop on the edge. His boss hates him and his wife hasn't spoken to him in a civil tone since he began an intense relationship with a certain Jack Daniel's. He is investigating a baffling murder/heist/disappearance. Unfortunately, he seems unlikely to solve it since his life is heading towards a tragedy of Rikki Lake proportions. He lives in New York or another city where it often rains. Stop me if this sounds familiar. And yet there is something marvellous about a top-notch, formulaic thriller, if you get it right. Of course there are crime movies told from the point of view of robbers, gangsters, serial killers and other undesirable antiheroes, but there is a pleasing symmetry in the cop-versus-bad-guy scenario. Even though our man Turner isn't exactly a candidate for sainthood. That's why you need the right actor to play him. He's a bit of a rebel with a shady past and an uncertain future. He only smiles in the presence of a bartender and only then with wry detachment. Hugh Grant need not apply. In fact, all the obvious choices are either dead - Bogart, McQueen, Mitchum - or too old to chase punks through the subway; sorry Nicholson, Eastwood and De Niro. Harvey Keitel would be fine but he can't be trusted to keep his trousers on. Russell Crowe was excellent as the tortured officer in LA Confidential. He'll do. Then there's the long-suffering wife. Her scenes will mainly consist of venting self-righteous rage at her errant husband and hanging around their surprisingly upmarket apartment in a designer negligee. In the last half-hour she will reveal a devastating secret which throws our increasingly resourceful hero off-kilter. Meryl Streep's agent isn't likely to call, but Salma Hayek's may. And the main villain? He must be British. There should also be a femme fatale. She needs an icy demeanour and hair colour that contrasts with the protagonist's wife. The plot will be an intriguing mix of corruption, sleaze and miscellaneous human detritus, taking increasingly beguiling twists. Hint: no one can be trusted. But the plot turns can't be too jaw-droppingly unexpected. There is a fine line between silly (Basic Instinct) and sublime (Chinatown). Finally, you need to hire a director. That's often the most difficult decision, but since all the right elements are in place this soon-to-be classic will virtually direct itself. So, sit back, relax and put a call in to Michael Winner.",

'No one knows how good that side might have become, that's one of life's tragedies, but what we have achieved with this squad in the last two years has been phenomenal,' he said. 'This is a special unit, a marvellous team, and it's a pleasure to be managing them. They did not sit back on last year's treble, the team have gone on to prove themselves and that's why I say they are the best ever. I'm 58 and more mellow than I used to be, but I could be even more sedate and it wouldn't matter, because all the players have the hunger. They are real winners, the team is full of players with inner drive, and I'm fortunate to have people like that.'",

Crewe's manager, Dario Gradi, said: 'He was the one who was taking the game to Stockport. It didn't look as if anyone else was going to threaten their goal. Mark should have had a hat-trick.' </p> <p>Bristol Rovers moved into third place in the Second Division promotion race with a 2-0 win over Bristol City.

      "body": "<p>Manchester United collected their sixth Premiership title in eight seasons with a minimum of fuss and an early flurry of goals, putting their Champions League disappointment behind them and Southampton's mini-revival under Glenn Hoddle firmly into perspective. </p> <p>Perhaps United were relieved to be playing relegation candidates after Real Madrid, although the Saints are now safe following Sheffield Wednesday's defeat. Or perhaps they were just anxious to end what little suspense was left in a title race which was effectively decided weeks ago. </p> <p>Either way they needed only seven minutes to score and no more than a third of the game to leave Southampton wishing they were playing some other opponents, some other Saturday. With half an hour on the clock United were leading 3-0, and Southampton had seen Dean Richards clear a David Beckham free-kick off the line and Neil Moss touch an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer shot on to the crossbar. </p> <p>Southampton doggedly stuck to their plan of crowding a midfield that was being cut to pieces by raking passes from Beckham and runs by Ryan Giggs as if transfixed by United's brilliance. The new champions could certainly have made the victory even more emphatic but were probably worried about attracting the attention of the League Against Cruel Sports. </p> <p>'There was never going to be a hangover from Wednesday,' Sir Alex Ferguson said. 'This team reacted to losing 5-0 to Chelsea and 3-0 to Newcastle by waking up and doing the business. Wednesday was a terrible night for us but losing is part of the game. It's how you recover that counts. I'm lucky to have a collection of players who mirror my own hunger, but the drive comes from within themselves. This is a team full of players with inner drive.' </p> <p>Ferguson singled out David Beckham as among the most driven of his players, and there was a certain predictability about the way he put United in front. Hoddle knows all about Beckham's range and ability at set pieces, so we must assume Francis Benali did not heed the warnings when he crashed into Andy Cole 20 yards out. Once referee Neale Barry marched the defensive wall back the full distance, the whole ground knew what was about to happen but Neil Moss was still powerless to prevent Beckham's free-kick curling into his top left corner. </p> <p>Eight minutes later Giggs's elegant flick opened up a tract of undefended left wing for Phil Neville to run into, and the full-back galloped into the area to unleash a low drive across the face of goal which the hapless Benali had little option but to turn past his goalkeeper. </p> <p>Then Solskjaer produced a stunning snap shot from a Giggs pass which Moss kept out with the aid of his woodwork, Richards retrieved another goal-bound Beckham effort after Tahar had handled within shooting range, and United still managed to extend their lead after 28 minutes. Beckham's crossfield pass picked out Solskjaer in the area, and the Norwegian's control and deadly left foot did the rest, a low shot beating Moss to his left. </p> <p>Ferguson values control in his strikers, judging from his scathing remarks about Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole's lack of it in Madrid, but Solskjaer, selected here instead of the former, is neatness and economy personified. The assumption seems to be that the perennial substitute will be leaving Old Trafford in the wake of \u00a316.5m Ruud van Nistelrooy's arrival, but this may be a misreading of the situation. </p> <p>United would not pay that sort of money for a reserve, and if the Dutch striker plays it is likely to be at the expense of a more regular member of the side. And any manager would think twice before selling Solskjaer, a wonderful player and model professional with a sensational left foot.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United collected their sixth Premiership title in eight seasons with a minimum of fuss and an early flurry of goals, putting their Champions League disappointment behind them and Southampton's mini-revival under Glenn Hoddle firmly into perspective. Perhaps United were relieved to be playing relegation candidates after Real Madrid, although the Saints are now safe following Sheffield Wednesday's defeat. Or perhaps they were just anxious to end what little suspense was left in a title race which was effectively decided weeks ago. Either way they needed only seven minutes to score and no more than a third of the game to leave Southampton wishing they were playing some other opponents, some other Saturday. With half an hour on the clock United were leading 3-0, and Southampton had seen Dean Richards clear a David Beckham free-kick off the line and Neil Moss touch an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer shot on to the crossbar. Southampton doggedly stuck to their plan of crowding a midfield that was being cut to pieces by raking passes from Beckham and runs by Ryan Giggs as if transfixed by United's brilliance. The new champions could certainly have made the victory even more emphatic but were probably worried about attracting the attention of the League Against Cruel Sports. 'There was never going to be a hangover from Wednesday,' Sir Alex Ferguson said. 'This team reacted to losing 5-0 to Chelsea and 3-0 to Newcastle by waking up and doing the business. Wednesday was a terrible night for us but losing is part of the game. It's how you recover that counts. I'm lucky to have a collection of players who mirror my own hunger, but the drive comes from within themselves. This is a team full of players with inner drive.' Ferguson singled out David Beckham as among the most driven of his players, and there was a certain predictability about the way he put United in front. Hoddle knows all about Beckham's range and ability at set pieces, so we must assume Francis Benali did not heed the warnings when he crashed into Andy Cole 20 yards out. Once referee Neale Barry marched the defensive wall back the full distance, the whole ground knew what was about to happen but Neil Moss was still powerless to prevent Beckham's free-kick curling into his top left corner. Eight minutes later Giggs's elegant flick opened up a tract of undefended left wing for Phil Neville to run into, and the full-back galloped into the area to unleash a low drive across the face of goal which the hapless Benali had little option but to turn past his goalkeeper. Then Solskjaer produced a stunning snap shot from a Giggs pass which Moss kept out with the aid of his woodwork, Richards retrieved another goal-bound Beckham effort after Tahar had handled within shooting range, and United still managed to extend their lead after 28 minutes. Beckham's crossfield pass picked out Solskjaer in the area, and the Norwegian's control and deadly left foot did the rest, a low shot beating Moss to his left. Ferguson values control in his strikers, judging from his scathing remarks about Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole's lack of it in Madrid, but Solskjaer, selected here instead of the former, is neatness and economy personified. The assumption seems to be that the perennial substitute will be leaving Old Trafford in the wake of \u00a316.5m Ruud van Nistelrooy's arrival, but this may be a misreading of the situation. United would not pay that sort of money for a reserve, and if the Dutch striker plays it is likely to be at the expense of a more regular member of the side. And any manager would think twice before selling Solskjaer, a wonderful player and model professional with a sensational left foot. At 27, seven years younger than Teddy Sheringham, Solskjaer has time to feature more prominently in United's attack, and the club should be wary about letting him feature in anyone else's. Solskjaer was substituted in a tame second half, which only briefly flickered to life when a couple of Southamp ton players declared open season on Beckham. Marian Pahars started it with a foul which earned him a booking on the stroke of the interval. Chris Marsden continued it with a heavy challenge early in the second half which brought instant retribution and a caution for Roy Keane, then Kevin Davies saw yellow for a hack at Beckham which had United players screaming for protection. Fit again after what Hoddle described as 'his flu situation', Pahars pulled a goal back for Southampton six minutes from the end with a crisp finish after a run down the right. By that time Southampton had sent a few more attacking players on and a United defence featuring Ronny Johnsen for the first time this season was almost sleepwalking through the game, but the overall outcome was never in doubt, a familiar enough scenario. United's season might have come to a somewhat abrupt conclusion with Wednesday's Champions League exit and the title now tied up a month before the FA Cup final, though it has been an extraordinary league campaign and one which could see several more records set. They have now scored 87 goals in 34 games, surpassing Newcastle's Premiership record of 82 set over a 42-game season, and at this rate must have a chance of becoming the first Premier League side to reach a century. Their current lead over Liverpool is 13 points, which if maintained would equal Everton's record set in 1985, again in a 42-game season. Depending on how their rivals fare United could conceivably stretch their lead. Just don't mention the FA Cup. 'We have played more games this season than Liverpool and Arsenal,' said a Ferguson clearly annoyed at suggestions United have made things easy for themselves. 'We have played 56 games already.' There are still four left, and as there was no Premiership trophy for United to parade round the Dell, they will just have to do all that at home to Chelsea tomorrow.

      "body": "<p>Indian journalist Pradeep Magazine has just updated his 1999 book Not Quite Cricket about corruption in the game in the sub-continent. In it he detailed how he met a Delhi bookmaker who offered him \u00a3600,000 to help 'fix' cricket matches. That meeting fired the curiousity of sports promoter Aushim Khetarpal - the man recently named by Chris Lewis in connection with a \u00a3300,000 offer to rig England games. Here is magazine's account of his meeting with Khetarpal.</p> <p>In 1999, I was in Mohali, a town in Punjab bordering Chandigarh, to watch the India-Pakistan one-day match on 1 April. The Mohali stadium is easily the best in India and one of the finest in the world. It shimmered neat and clean in the bright sunlight. The man responsible for its creation, Inderjeet Singh Bindra, former president of the Indian Cricket Board and, until not very long ago, the most powerful man in Indian cricket, is now in grave trouble over it. </p> <p>Bindra, a high-ranking official in the Punjab government, leased a barren plot of land for the Punjab Cricket Association of which he is president. Subsequently he was charged by the Central Bureau of Investigation with misuse of his position to get the stadium made... the case is being investigated, but whatever the outcome of the probe, Bindra still deserves credit for raising a stadium that offers facilities unheard of in India. </p> <p>Then I saw a familiar face. It was Aushim Khetarpal (the man named by Chris Lewis last week in connection with a \u00a3300,000 'bribe'), a self-styled sports promoter. Having organised several tennis and billiards tournaments, he had switched to veterans' cricket involving former Test players from Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and South Africa. He was also a man with a special knack for getting into trouble, especially when it came to money. </p> <p>Khetarpal had bought part of the stadium advertising rights for the India-Pakistan match. 'I have also signed most of the Pakistani cricketers like Saqlain Mushtaq and Wasim Akram. There is very little money in Pakistan cricket. I will get these players good sponsorship deals from India,' he boasted. </p> <p>In the press box, we were treated to a lavish diet of beer, whisky, snacks and hot food. Late in the evening I went to the club house where Bindra had agreed to meet me for an informal chat. In the lobby I bumped into Khetarpal, his wife and daughter. </p> <p>He too was waiting for Bindra, to discuss with him the details of buying the rights of an inter-club cricket series that Punjab Cricket Association were planning to host. In the meantime, Bindra's secretary asked me when I was leaving for Delhi. Sensing that my appointment might be in jeopardy, I told him that I could not postpone my departure any longer. Suddenly there was a commotion inside the lobby and someone said: 'Bindra sahib has come.' </p> <p>Bindra walked in with a few others - guests from Pakistan, he said. He was too busy to talk to me. Not too busy, however, for Khetarpal with whom he spent a good half an hour. Since I had accepted Khetarpal's invitation to travel with him to Delhi, I waited outside for them. The saloon attached to his car was quite comfortable, with a bed, chair, washbasin and fridge neatly arranged inside. I was offered a stiff drink by Khetarpal and our journey to Delhi began. </p> <p>We soon fell into conversation about his business dealings. Khetarpal brushed a mop of hair from his forehead and said: 'You know, if I had not started it all, sports would not have got the kind of money it has today.' </p> <p>He started off on a brief history of his exploits. How he had interviewed sportsmen and women and written about them in newspapers. How one day he had thought of starting his own sports promotion company. </p> <p>'I had no money but I was determined to start a promotion company of my own. As I was walking down the road one day I saw this neon sign glowing in a shop, flashing \"Radiant shoes\". Then and there I decided to name my company Radiant - Radiant Management Group. </p> <p>'Next I decided to open a tennis academy. I approached a business house and told them that I needed finances for starting an academy at the Modern School tennis courts. They agreed. My next step was to approach the Modern School authorities and tell them that a big business house was ready to finance a tennis academy and it would be good publicity for the school if the academy was run on their school courts. They agreed.' Khetarpal looked at me triumphantly. </p> <p>'The tennis academy became the best in India. Luckily for me, in the academy was a son of the Director General of Doordarshan [India's public service TV]. I came very close to this man. He became like my godfather. I tied up the national championship and made arrangement with Doordarshan to show it live. That was the first time a sports meet was live on television. That is why I say I am the man who started it all.' </p> <p>Later he met Zaheer Abbas, the former Pakistan Test batsman, who in those days was courting an Indian woman (whom he later married) and used to be in Delhi quite often. 'Through Zaheer Abbas I roped in Jansher Khan [the former world squash champion] who agreed to play in Bombay. It was a big show and the photograph of me receiving Jansher at the airport was carried by most of the newspapers.' </p> <p>I reminded him gently that most of the tournaments he had organised had run into trouble. He had even been accused of not paying the players as promised. </p> <p>'Look, if that was the case I would not be here. I did suffer drawbacks and some problems had to arise. But all is well now. I am back. Had my dealings not been clean I would not have been accepted. Look, I got Ajay Jadeja his first major break when I got him signed by Liberty Shoes. I was the man who brokered the deal for the Hero Honda Cup in 1994. You have seen me working in the 1996 World Cup. I got Zaheer Abbas to write in the Indian Express. You wait and watch what I am going to do. If I had a bad reputation in the market, do you think Mr Bindra would have allowed me to do a deal?' </p> <p>All along the drive to Delhi, Khetarpal kept asking about the bookie I had met. Where he lived and how he operated. In between, he told me how betting was essential for the development of cricket. 'It is only when big betting comes to a sport that it becomes big. The only thing wrong here is that players are throwing away matches. They should not sell the nation. Otherwise betting will generate a lot of money for the game. It is not a bad thing. It will do more good than harm.'</p>",

The saloon attached to his car was quite comfortable, with a bed, chair, washbasin and fridge neatly arranged inside. I was offered a stiff drink by Khetarpal and our journey to Delhi began. We soon fell into conversation about his business dealings. Khetarpal brushed a mop of hair from his forehead and said: 'You know, if I had not started it all, sports would not have got the kind of money it has today.' He started off on a brief history of his exploits. How he had interviewed sportsmen and women and written about them in newspapers. How one day he had thought of starting his own sports promotion company. 'I had no money but I was determined to start a promotion company of my own. As I was walking down the road one day I saw this neon sign glowing in a shop, flashing \"Radiant shoes\". Then and there I decided to name my company Radiant - Radiant Management Group. 'Next I decided to open a tennis academy. I approached a business house and told them that I needed finances for starting an academy at the Modern School tennis courts. They agreed. My next step was to approach the Modern School authorities and tell them that a big business house was ready to finance a tennis academy and it would be good publicity for the school if the academy was run on their school courts. They agreed.' Khetarpal looked at me triumphantly. 'The tennis academy became the best in India. Luckily for me, in the academy was a son of the Director General of Doordarshan [India's public service TV]. I came very close to this man. He became like my godfather. I tied up the national championship and made arrangement with Doordarshan to show it live. That was the first time a sports meet was live on television. That is why I say I am the man who started it all.' Later he met Zaheer Abbas, the former Pakistan Test batsman, who in those days was courting an Indian woman (whom he later married) and used to be in Delhi quite often. 'Through Zaheer Abbas I roped in Jansher Khan [the former world squash champion] who agreed to play in Bombay. It was a big show and the photograph of me receiving Jansher at the airport was carried by most of the newspapers.' I reminded him gently that most of the tournaments he had organised had run into trouble. He had even been accused of not paying the players as promised. 'Look, if that was the case I would not be here. I did suffer drawbacks and some problems had to arise. But all is well now. I am back. Had my dealings not been clean I would not have been accepted. Look, I got Ajay Jadeja his first major break when I got him signed by Liberty Shoes. I was the man who brokered the deal for the Hero Honda Cup in 1994. You have seen me working in the 1996 World Cup. I got Zaheer Abbas to write in the Indian Express. You wait and watch what I am going to do. If I had a bad reputation in the market, do you think Mr Bindra would have allowed me to do a deal?' All along the drive to Delhi, Khetarpal kept asking about the bookie I had met. Where he lived and how he operated. In between, he told me how betting was essential for the development of cricket. 'It is only when big betting comes to a sport that it becomes big. The only thing wrong here is that players are throwing away matches. They should not sell the nation. Otherwise betting will generate a lot of money for the game. It is not a bad thing. It will do more good than harm.'",

      "body": "<p>Last week Chris Lewis was paid a substantial sum by the News of the World - reported to be \u00a330,000 - for his 'revelations' about match-fixing within the England Test team. Not only was he himself offered \u00a3300,000, but he claimed he had been told that three England players had been on an Indian bookmaker's payroll. </p> <p>Lewis was reviled by many within cricket, but now, in an interview with Charles Colvile to be broadcast on Sky this afternoon, he says all the details that appeared in last week's report had been passed on to the English Cricket Board last summer - and they ignored them. </p> <p><strong>Colvile: When was contact made with you? </strong> </p> <p>Lewis: Well initially it started off with a phone call, being invited by somebody that I've known from time to time, that I got tickets for games. He called me up and said that he had some friends coming over from India, and that he had a business proposition he wanted to discuss, and I think I met with him something like the following week. </p> <p><strong> And what was the man's name? </strong> </p> <p>Well, for legal reasons I'm not going to say, all the information, is with the police and all the right authorities. </p> <p><strong> Had you any idea what type of business meeting it was likely to be? </strong> </p> <p>No. I was told that the people involved were in entertainment. It was as simple as that. And I went along with that until I actually had the meeting... Then it became very clear that what the people were actually after was to buy, to organise for me to actually fix an England match versus New Zealand at Old Trafford. </p> <p><strong> Why do you think you were chosen to broker this deal?</strong> </p> <p>I have no idea. At the time I wasn't involved in the England set-up, I wasn't playing any international cricket. People were trying the best way they could to achieve what they wanted and they thought that via me would have been a good way of doing it. </p> <p><strong> How much money was on offer?</strong> </p> <p>It was \u00a3300,000 I was offered. If I could actually arrange for this match to be sort of fixed. </p> <p><strong> That was your fee?</strong> </p> <p>No, that was the money they were offering which would have also involved fees of other players. </p> <p><strong> So, what was your reaction when this business proposition was put to you? </strong></p> <p> I was obviously shocked. Because at this time I wasn't in the England cricket team. And \u00a3300,000 is a lot of money. It's not football we're talking, it's cricket! </p> <p><strong> And what did you say?</strong> </p> <p>At the time I just listened. The conversation was left where they would call me the following day to see what my reaction was. I then left the meeting and I called my manager and called my solicitor directly after and told them exactly what was happening. </p> <p>The following morning we called the Board at 9am. I expressed to them exactly what had happened. I gave them full details of everything. I also informed them that the people were still here in the country and which hotel they were staying at. They did nothing about it and it was left for a week or so.</p> <p> I was back at Lord's playing cricket and then I was told a week later by the Board that it was probably in our best interests to report it to the police, which I did, and after a period of perhaps a week or so had many meetings with the police. I gave my full account and recollection of what had been said during that meeting. There hasn't been a great deal after that because the police have all the information.</p> <p> <strong> Now, this initially all came out in the story in the News of the World last year, so this is the story where it is written that you were asked to see if you could get Alec Stewart to drop catches and Alan Mullally to bowl badly - is that right? </strong> </p> <p>Yes, that's basically right, when they initially asked me to fix the match, they suggested that I should talk to these people and didn't suggest that these guys were involved in any way. They just suggested that these were a couple of people that I should try to tap up. </p> <p><strong> It was also at the meeting that you were told there were three England cricketers who were already involved with the bookmakers syndicate? </strong> </p> <p>Yes, three names were mentioned to me at the time - I had no information regarding whether an England player was actually taking a bribe - at the time of my original statement to the ECB, I mentioned this to them, that three England players' names were mentioned and they were not interested in these names. This was also mentioned to the police, the names of those people have been with the police since the beginning. </p> <p><strong> So let's get this absolutely straight, during a conversation you had with Indian bookmakers in London last year you were told that three England cricketers were already involved? </strong> </p> <p>I was told that three England players had already received the money. He didn't say what it was for, whether it was fixing matches or information or anything. I passed [that information] on to the Board when I had the initial meeting with them. I told them what had been said and the reply was that this was hearsay and they didn't want the names. The police, on the other hand, were interested in the names and have had them since the beginning. </p> <p><strong> Who was your contact at the England and Wales Cricket Board? </strong> </p> <p> (laughs) I'm sure we could actually find that out, I don't know what the implications are as regards the legalities of it so I will keep the names out, but I did meet with a representative of the ECB. </p> <p><strong> Well this is a fairly serious conversation. Here we are in April with everybody getting hot under the collar about betting saying that the ECB have known about these allegations for months: </strong> </p> <p>Of course they have. There is no new information. When I went to the ECB I told them all there was to tell, including the fact that there were three players mentioned. They were not interested. The police were. The ECB have known that there were three play ers involved or three players names who've been mentioned. The ECB chose not to hear those names. </p> <p><strong> And you can't tell us who the person at the ECB was who you spoke to? </strong> </p> <p>No, but I'm sure it's easily found out. </p> <p><strong> Well I wouldn't know where to start - is the person still involved on the board?</strong> </p> <p>Yes.</p> <p> <strong> What about the three names - are you going to tell us who they are? </strong></p> <p> No, because the only information I have is second-hand information that was passed on to me by this chap and he's said a lot of things. Whether those things are actually true or not is down to the ECB and the police to prove. I don't think it's in my best interests, certainly in those players best interests, to be spouting their names because I have no evidence that they have actually done anything. </p> <p><strong> Every England player out there, they all feel they are now under suspicion. </strong></p> <p> I can understand players feeling that way, simply because of how the statements have come out over the past few days. The reality of this is that all was told last year and it was down to the ECB to do something about it. The ECB have consistently told players that if they are ever approached to go to them and they will handle it and that was exactly what was done - a matter of hours after I spoke to this chap. The ECB have the full story. </p> <p><strong> So why have you waited until April 2000 to go back to the News of the World and come up with this additional titbit? </strong> </p> <p>Well, there is no additional titbit. </p> <p><strong> So the NoW knew about this in August?</strong></p> <p> I don't whether the NoW knew about this but it's no new information. This is the same story I have been telling since the beginning. </p> <p><strong> Chris, you'll understand that people think it's a little mischievous that last August you were widely featured in a newspaper article saying you had been approached to nobble Alec Stewart and Alan Mullally. Now here we are in April and you said, 'Oh, incidentally, at the same time I was also told that three England players were on the take':</strong> </p> <p>The NoW [story] that appeared last year was not written by me. I did not give it to the NoW . In fact the initial info did not come from Chris Lewis. The leak came after I told the info to the ECB - days after I was approached by a newspaper who already knew what I had said. The only time I've spoken to a newspaper - the NoW - has been this time around. </p> <p><strong> So you never spoke to them in August?</strong> </p> <p>No, no. I did not give them an interview, certainly did not receive any money for it or anything. That was something they did all on their own hence that's why there's a discrepancy now because it's the first time I've actually spoken. </p> <p><strong> Can I go back to the three players who you say were mentioned to you? Is it a fair assumption, given the way the story was written initially, that Alec Stewart and Alan Mullally were not involved because you were approached to nobble them? Presumably, if they had already been approached, you wouldn't be needed to get to them?</strong></p> <p> I'm just not getting involved as regards to players' names - I have no way of proving whether that information is right, wrong or it's just actually hearsay. That's why I'm upset myself because the whole thing has come out in the way it has [after] I've played this by the book and I've done it a long time ago.</p> <p> <strong> Well it's not a huge deal to say they definitely weren't the names, is it? </strong></p> <p> I think it's probably wise not to get involved at all with regards to... names. </p> <p> <strong> What do you feel about your position, especially after Darren Gough, Angus Fraser and Ian Botham have said you should name players or shut up and retract?</strong> </p> <p>As I keep pointing out, these players were named right at the onset_ right from the beginning_ the reality of the situation is that as cricketers we've got a serious problem on our hands. There's bribery and everything going on and anybody who knows anything about it should tell that to the authorities. I have done that. </p> <p>When I went to the ECB and told them about this situation I pointed out to the ECB that it was a very delicate situation and that to be perfectly honest as much as possible it should be kept hush hush. The leak that the News of the World got hold of - and I spoke to a man from the NoW who came to see me who already had seen my statement - I thought came from the ECB. It didn't get into the news because of me, it got into the news because of a leak from somewhere else. </p> <p><strong> But it's got into the news this time because of you? </strong> </p> <p>Yes it certainly has, not giving new information, just reiterating what I said at the beginning. </p> <p><strong> Do you have any regrets for accepting the fee and speaking out last Sunday?</strong></p> <p> Um, no, like I said the whole bribery thing is very relevant and if somebody has something to say they should say it - the first step was to inform the authorities and I did that. </p> <p><strong> You're aware that if no evidence is found against the players the Board might slap a disrepute charge against you? </strong> </p> <p>In all honesty there are a lot of things that are possible. All I can do is what I've done - tell the truth. And I have. I haven't held anything back. </p> <p><strong> But we come back to this basic thing that you said it to the Board, you said it to the police, but you didn't say it to the NoW or any newspaper and now you've chosen to make it public. </strong> </p> <p>The whole match-fixing allegation has been public for a long time - since August when the NoW ran their first article. That wasn't made public by Chris Lewis. That was made public by the Board. The people who made that leak in the first place have to look at themselves. </p> <p><strong> With a lot of your former colleagues not exactly pleased with what you've done, how are you going to cope with that? Do you think you might have to give the game up? </strong></p> <p> It's certainly hard to say. I've got probably two to three years, I think, of cricket left and I think at this precise moment I've no intentions of changing that. I don't perceive that in this match-fixing thing I've done anything wrong. I'm not a match fixer, I've never been involved with match fixing. All I've done is report this. I'm sorry if it makes some people feel unhappy, but it's still the right thing to do. </p> <p><strong> Do you believe that the three players you were told of, you know who they are, you've played with them, do you believe they are involved or were?</strong> </p> <p>No, because there's no evidence whatsoever. I'm not implicating anyone because I have no evidence, I'm repeating the conversation I had. </p> <p><strong> You do have first-hand evidence of [alleged] incompetence by the ECB so can you tell us who that official was and who decided it wasn't important enough to talk to you about it? </strong></p> <p> I'm sure the information will come out in due course. </p> <p><strong> Have they got the names now?</strong> </p> <p>Yes, they asked for them and I gave them.</p> <p> <strong> Where do you think this is all going to end for English cricket and for you? </strong></p> <p> I think it's obvious that there does need to be some sort of investigation - where this actually stands for Chris Lewis I don't know, but certainly at the moment it's looking very bleak because, and I'll use my words, because I think somebody here is being less than honest, they are not telling the true story as it is. </p> <p><strong> Someone at the Board? </strong> </p> <p>Yes, and it's important to me because people are saying things and as you've mentioned, it's quite possible that my cricketing career could be on the line and to be quite honest I'm not having any of it, because I haven't done anything wrong. People have had this information for a long time; what they have done with it or haven't done with it is up to them, but they have had it. There's no point in playing deaf and dumb now. </p> <p><strong> Do you regret [last week's] article in the News of the World? If you had your time again, would you keep your mouth shut?</strong> </p> <p>No, to be honest I regret going to the Board because this could all have been sorted by the people just coming out and going 'I have this information already' and there's this ongoing investigation. Instead we get things like 'We're passing the new information on to the police' when everyone's aware that there's no new information. </p> <p><strong> Have you spoken to the police again?</strong></p> <p>I have had discussions with the police again, but I haven't any new information to give them because there is none. </p> <p><em>Abridged from Extra Cover's Chris Lewis interview on Sky Sport 1 today at 2.15pm during lunch at Sussex v Hampshire.</em></p>",

I don't perceive that in this match-fixing thing I've done anything wrong. I'm not a match fixer, I've never been involved with match fixing. All I've done is report this. I'm sorry if it makes some people feel unhappy, but it's still the right thing to do. Do you believe that the three players you were told of, you know who they are, you've played with them, do you believe they are involved or were? No, because there's no evidence whatsoever. I'm not implicating anyone because I have no evidence, I'm repeating the conversation I had. You do have first-hand evidence of [alleged] incompetence by the ECB so can you tell us who that official was and who decided it wasn't important enough to talk to you about it? I'm sure the information will come out in due course. Have they got the names now? Yes, they asked for them and I gave them. Where do you think this is all going to end for English cricket and for you? I think it's obvious that there does need to be some sort of investigation - where this actually stands for Chris Lewis I don't know, but certainly at the moment it's looking very bleak because, and I'll use my words, because I think somebody here is being less than honest, they are not telling the true story as it is. Someone at the Board? Yes, and it's important to me because people are saying things and as you've mentioned, it's quite possible that my cricketing career could be on the line and to be quite honest I'm not having any of it, because I haven't done anything wrong. People have had this information for a long time; what they have done with it or haven't done with it is up to them, but they have had it. There's no point in playing deaf and dumb now. Do you regret [last week's] article in the News of the World? If you had your time again, would you keep your mouth shut? No, to be honest I regret going to the Board because this could all have been sorted by the people just coming out and going 'I have this information already' and there's this ongoing investigation. Instead we get things like 'We're passing the new information on to the police' when everyone's aware that there's no new information. Have you spoken to the police again? I have had discussions with the police again, but I haven't any new information to give them because there is none.

The holders were certainly up against it when Raul made it two from Steve McManaman's delightful pass, but it was the third goal, both in its finality and its breathtaking execution, which confirmed United were just as susceptible as Chelsea to football's oldest and most immutable rule. </p> <p>There is no substitute for class, and United were outclassed at Old Trafford just as comprehensively as Chelsea had been at the Nou Camp a day earlier. Frankly admitting his own side had been unable to handle Barcelona, Vialli had offered Manchester United as a possible stumbling block when asked whether he thought the Catalans could go all the way.</p> <p> But Sir Alex Ferguson's players were unable to repay his confidence in front of their own supporters when faced by a supposedly less fearsome Spanish outfit. Had United been in Chelsea's shoes on Tuesday they might have protected a 3-1 lead for longer than Vialli's cautiously selected team, but there is serious doubt over whether they would have fared any better against the whirlwind of the Barcelona attack. </p> <p> The reasoning is simple. United's defence has not been functioning particularly impressively all season, it is their attack that has been sweeping them to stylish victories. By domestic standards United's attack is state of the art: they rarely encounter teams with players capable of bettering what is seen every week at Old Trafford, but the Spanish commitment to attack is something else again. </p> <p>Barcelona and Real have higher octane attacks than Manchester United are used to. Rivaldo, Luis Figo and Patrick Kluivert would all get into United's team, Chelsea's team, anybody's team. Real, who attack right down to the full-backs, perhaps have even more covetable players. For once, at Old Trafford on Wednesday, the opposition were not cowering in the dressing room poring over the United teamsheet. </p> <p>Only Keane, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham could walk into the Real side. There might be cases to be made for Paul Scholes and Jaap Stam, but the probability is that Real would be interested in fewer than half of United's players. Against which United would fancy most of Real, which makes a change from merely admiring a Gabriel Batistuta here or a Sol Campbell there.</p> <p> Even the teenage stand-in goalkeeper distinguished himself at Old Trafford, and the much-vilified (though not by Ferguson) Steve McManaman was one of the most influential players over the two legs. In short, Real had class in every department, while United were forced to acknowledge they had some catching up to do. </p> <p>Not that Gary Neville was ever going to catch up with Roberto Carlos, Denis Irwin hold Michael Salgado, or Berg predict that Redondo would use a backheel to beat him on the outside. But the failure of the formula that has served United so well all season, relying on their forward momentum to roll over opposing defences, was the big letdown. In neither leg did Dwight Yorke or Andy Cole give Real anything to worry about. The determined Giggs and Beckham both showed up well on the flanks, but the most likely source of a United goal until Beckham took matters into his own hands seemed to be one of Keane's bullocking runs. </p> <p>Yorke and Cole's lack of control was not as pronounced as it had been in the first leg, but any telepathy between the two seems to have disappeared. In a contest which Ferguson accepted was going to be all about attack, United trailed a distant second to the clever running and incisive finishing of Raul and Co. </p> <p> 'Paceless and lacking in ability' was how Roberto Carlos had described United's attack after the first leg, and United's immediate purchase of \u00a319m Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy makes further comment unnecessary. </p> <p> Ferguson said he was shocked by the defeat, perhaps because he had imagined his defence would hold up better, perhaps because he had expected more of his attack, but probably because he thought he had said goodbye to the powerless sense of inadequacy which must have overwhelmed him when United went 3-0 down. </p> <p>Six years ago in Barcelona was the last time United received such a spanking in Europe, and even then there were extenuating circumstances, such as Eric Cantona's suspension and Peter Schmeichel's absence due to the limit on overseas players. But Barcelona's 4-0 slapping down of a confident United side who were convinced they were on the verge of something big still hurt in the same way that Tuesday's 5-1 result crushed Chelsea, who, because of their first-leg lead more than any reasoned assessment of playing strengths, must have allowed themselves to dream they could go through. Chelsea, if it is any consolation, are approximately where United were in 1994, though their future direction is less clear. </p> <p>'We did our best but they were too good for us,' said solitary goalscorer Tore Andre Flo. 'At least we have the experience for later.' Yes, but how long will the likes of Marcel Desailly, Gianfranco Zola and Didier Deschamps be sticking around now that Chelsea have explored the limit of how far you can go with Serie A cast-offs? </p> <p>Even stalwarts like Dennis Wise, Dan Petrescu and Ed de Goey must be aware they are unlikely to get as close to the European Cup again in a Chelsea shirt. It does not take a genius to work out that a period of transition will follow this season's FA Cup final, but what sort of Chelsea will emerge at the other end? Do Ken Bates and the Chelsea Village have the funds and the nerve to redouble their efforts in the transfer market? </p> <p>As a London club, Chelsea are in some ways better placed than United to attract leading players, but in terms of purchasing power and international kudos they can no more compete with Barcelona than Stamford Bridge can outshout the Nou Camp. Money matters in football, that is why Chelsea are playing Champions League football and Spurs are not, but Bates's wage bill is already eye-watering enough without contemplating what it would take to attract a young Desailly to England or join the bidding when a Kluivert or Rivaldo comes on to the market. </p> <p> The limit of Chelsea's ambition, or put more prosaically the depth of their pockets, was illustrated when they dropped out of the race to sign Van Nistelrooy to leave the way clear for Manchester United. Should United have the Dutchman and Tottenham's Campbell in place for the start of next season, they will have replicated the Stam-Yorke double signing which underpinned their treble success. </p> <p>The cost will be roughly double too, but the world's most profitable club can cope with that. Once decidedly niggardly over expenditure, United now appear to have worked out that an extravagant purchase or two keeps the supporters happy and the share price stable, in addition to turning domestic rivals an envious shade of green. This is the continental model, of course, the way Italian and Spanish giants have been conducting their affairs for years. In theory next year's Premiership title should be even more of a formality for United than this season's, though if it was that simple Barcelona, Real or Valencia would be on top of the Spanish League, instead of which Deportivo are five points clear. </p> <p> The downside of assembling a side studded with world-class superstars is that domestic matters tend to be relegated to the level of any other business, and the manager inevitably loses a degree of control. Louis van Gaal and Vicente del Bosque might be trailing clouds of glory now but have spent most of the season deflecting criticism. Both managers could have been sacked this week, which is why claims that La Liga is now the leading competition in Europe are as spurious as those premature suggestions of a month or so ago that Premiership teams were about to carry off all the prizes. Not least of Ferguson's many achievements at Old Trafford has been his high degree of control, ensured by building a United side in his own image, nurturing a core of home-produced players who share his philosophy and conform willingly to his work ethic. </p> <p>Sheer tenacity was the element of surprise United successfully utilised in Europe last year - Juventus underestimated their determination in Turin, for example, and Bayern Munich fatally imagined one goal would be enough - but top teams do not fall for the same sting twice. Spirit, as every manager knows, can only get you so far. It took United a long way last season, but the plain truth is that the work ethic does not always win against rich and outrageously gifted Spanish slackers. </p> <p>United are now too big a concern to revert to domestic disputes, they have little choice but to buy into the European elite, and look as if they have already started. Last year's treble was a fabulous achievement by a reasonably local team who were not all that expensively assembled, but the next time United win the Champions League it will be by more conventional means.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Charles Bukowski and the death of the American Dream : not something you would expect your stereotypical Millwall defender to be able to pronounce, let alone read, let alone write. Yet this was the title of Matthew Lawrence's thesis for his degree course in American Literature at Hartwick College, Oneonte, New York State.</p> <p> 'The conclusion was that for Bukowski there was no American Dream because of the lifestyle he led and what he saw when he was working in the Post Office. The people were 35 to 40 and looked 50 to 60. They literally died on the job.' </p> <p>'It was so regimented. They had to throw so many letters in an hour or they were sacked. And at the end of the day he would go to the bar in preparation for the next day. Because what else was there to do? It was impossible for them to leave the bleak nature of the job. The Americans said that there was no class system, everyone was middle-class, but from what he saw this was obviously not true.' </p> <p>Wow. And I'd come to talk about playing against Wrighty at Turf Moor yesterday, and Millwall's big week (their next games are against fellow promotion contenders Gillingham and Preston) and whether he preferred operating in a flat back four or a 3-5-2 system. And what it's like at Millwall. And we're talking about Bukowski. </p> <p>Which isn't perhaps so strange because if Bukowski had hung around New Cross rather than L.A he would surely have written about Cold Blow Lane. Bukowski, the author of Post Office, Women and Factotum , is perhaps the greatest chronicler of American low-life. He wrote of hangovers, shit stains on his underwear, classical music, horse-racing and whores. He wrote the screenplay for Barfly which provided Mickey Rourke with the role he was born to play. 'Sometimes you just have to roll the potato', is the way Mickey excuses a catalogue of bad behaviour and to this day no one has a clue what he means. </p> <p> So does Lawrence practise what he reads and live like Bukowski, stumbling from the bar every Saturday afternoon to play right-back for Millwall? 'It's a romantic lifestyle from the outside: the drinking, the smoking and the women. And I had a go at college. But things are rather different now I'm a professional footballer.' </p> <p>His interest in literature survived studying for an English A-Level. 'Being forced to read your Shakespeare, your Milton, your Pride and Preju dice, The Mayor of Casterbridge . They weren't books that I was interested in. My worst memories are sitting down to study Eng Lit. Shakespeare, God bless him, may be the greatest author but analysing two of his paragraphs in a double lesson lasting an hour and 50 minutes...' </p> <p>A friend gave him a copy of Kerouac's On the Road who 'was not quite the same as your Shakespeare'. He was soon hooked on the Beats reading all of Kerouac, Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg and Bukowski. At about the same time, while staying at Lillieshall with the England under-18 schoolboys he 'got a call from one of the English coaches saying a fella wanted to talk to me and I met him in the restaurant and he offered me a full scholarship for four years there and then.' One hundred thousand dollars worth of education. ' </p> <p>He enjoyed his time as a College Boy. Oneonte is, by American standards, football- crazy and although it has a population of only 20,000, nearly half of whom are students, it is home to The National Soccer Hall of Fame. They can attract crowds of between 5,000 and 6,000. Back in 1997, they won the National Championships, the equivalent, given their size, of a non-league team winning the FA Cup. </p> <p>While Lawrence was there with a team of 'Four or five English lads making up the backbone, some Canadians, some Americans from Idaho, Virginia and Georgia, and a Greek lad' they reached the final 16, losing to Princeton, and the quarters, losing to Virginia. Not bad considering the difficulties they had selecting players. 'If someone was approached by Hartwick and an Ivy League university it's like being given the choice between Man Utd and Watford. Although obviously I'm not picking Watford as a bad team just in case Graham Taylor is on the phone next week.' </p> <p>He crammed for his final semester to give himself until the end of May to make it as a pro. Alan Smith, then at Wycombe, came in for him almost immediately. 'I really thought he was very, very good,' says Smith. 'He was playing for Grays Athletic and there were a couple of identical twins who ran the club. I had to give the twins 250 footballs to sign Matt.' </p> <p>At Wycombe, Smith turned Lawrence from an attacking midfielder into a right-back. 'He just thought I'd be good there. It wasn't as if he put me on a pitch and got a left-winger to run at me 200 times.' From Wycombe he went to Fulham and thrived in Mickey Adams's team. Then Adams was pushed aside to make way for Keegan. 'When Mickey got the sack there was a big goodbye and he said to all of us, \"I'll give you one piece of advice - get an agent\".' </p> <p> He heeded the advice but it did him little good negotiating with Keegan. It was back to Wycombe and then, a month ago, on to Millwall. Only 25, he still feels his best years are to come, that he is just beginning his career and even though Millwall have many young players of 18 and 19, who have been pros for more than three years, he doesn't regret taking four years off to finish his education. 'I wouldn't have missed it for the world. It's important to broaden your horizons and widen your knowledge.' </p> <p>It is a sentiment shared by Steve Palmer, the Watford midfield player, who has a degree in software engineering from Cambridge University. 'The majority of players are intelligent people. Maybe not educated, but intelligent. They respect what I've done and, in some ways, would also like to have something behind them for later on.' </p> <p>Both Lawrence and Palmer contradict David Pleat's recent statement to a conference in Geneva that 'I don't think we should impose education on these boys. Only one out of 10 has enough brains to become successful academically. Even the foreign kids speak better English than these guys. Education is wasted on them.'</p> <p> It wasn't wasted on Lawrence. 'He's the classic example of someone who is well-rounded, came in later, and will be better for it,' says Alan Smith. 'He's definitely better than a Nationwide Division Two player.' And If Millwall have a good week he will have the chance to prove it in the First Division next season. </p> <p>Looking at his bookshelves - loads of Bukowski, Irvine Welsh, Hunter S Thompson and Raymond Carver - I ask if he's ever thought of writing a football novel like (although obviously very different from) Steve Bruce. 'Stephen Hughes?' he says. 'No, Steve Bruce.' 'I'd love to. It's a romantic image - a novelist clunking away at a typewriter - but it takes a lot of time. Maybe 10 years down the line.'</p>",

'He's the classic example of someone who is well-rounded, came in later, and will be better for it,' says Alan Smith. 'He's definitely better than a Nationwide Division Two player.' And If Millwall have a good week he will have the chance to prove it in the First Division next season. Looking at his bookshelves - loads of Bukowski, Irvine Welsh, Hunter S Thompson and Raymond Carver - I ask if he's ever thought of writing a football novel like (although obviously very different from) Steve Bruce. 'Stephen Hughes?' he says. 'No, Steve Bruce.' 'I'd love to. It's a romantic image - a novelist clunking away at a typewriter - but it takes a lot of time. Maybe 10 years down the line.'",

Susan Sarandon has the abolition of the death penalty; Richard Gere has Tibet; Tom Hanks has World War II veterans; and now Leo has, well, the planet.</p> <p> The depth of the Titanic star's concerns are demonstrated by the fact that he has found himself agonising over whether to order a burger on room service. 'I shouldn't be eating hamburgers because the methane gas cows release is the number one contributor to the destruction of the ozone layer,' he has been at pains to explain. 'The number one reason they destroy the rainforest is to make grazing ground for cattle. So,' he concluded, tortured, 'it's very ironic that I eat beef, being the environmentalist that I am.' </p> <p>In Jay McInerney's satire on the celebrity industry, Model Behaviour, his journalist narrator, a hagiographer to the stars, has quick commands installed on his computer.

' In future, he might add [ctrl- new dawn] as in: 'Now we have entered the new millennium I am realising there is great deal more to care about in this world than simply cranking out product.'</p> <p> DiCaprio's personal assault on global warming has been orchestrated by his aptly named PR consultant Ken Sunshine. Sunshine is a grown-up version of what the film industry has taken to calling 'P-girls', political assistants to the stars. P-girls know their way round Washington and spend their days working to find the perfect 'fit' between a star's profile and a charity or campaign.</p> <p> Sunshine approached DiCaprio not long after the ecological protests that surrounded the making of his most recent film, The Beach, when a portion of the Thai coastline was somewhat remodelled. 'Leo,' says Sunshine solemnly, 'reads more scientific magazines and books than anyone I know, and knows more about global warming than most reporters covering it. I've worked with phoneys trying to use issues to enhance their images, but Leo isn't one of them.' </p> <p> One of the curious things about DiCaprio's emergence as a matin\u00e9e idol Swampy is that he has hidden his soul-searching for so long. The current issue of George (the magazine set up by the late John F. Kennedy Jnr) is devoted to a kind of academy awards for seasoned single-issue celebs. On its cover a tousle-haired Michael Douglas has 'No Nukes' written across his face. Inside we are invited to applaud everyone from Charlton Heston, embattled campaigner for the American right to bear arms, to Gillian Anderson, spokesperson for the Feminist Majority Foundation, promoting equality. 'I'm not much of a public person,' says Anderson, photographed in a dress apparently made from exotic feathers, 'and I have mixed feelings about the celebrity aspect of the business I am in. The only true benefit is when one can be of service.' </p> <p> George, whose proprietor was a connoisseur of the vanishing dividing line between celebrity and politics, was established to bridge the gap between glossy magazine culture and serious debate. We are used to the concept of celebrities selling things, ran the editorial thinking, so why not have them sell ideas and news? This concept was by no means a new one - witness the way British broadsheets have long peppered their mastheads with this week's B-listers as desperate offerings to the gods of circulation, or the furore that was provoked in America when Roseanne Barr was invited to edit an issue of the New Yorker. (John Seabrook, a New Yorker writer, in his new book Nobrow , takes Tina Brown's arrival at the magazine as the point when America traded its soul to shallowness.) </p> <p>DiCaprio's audience with the President is simply the latest example of this trend, and the storm it has provoked in the past two weeks among American journalists shows how justifiably paranoid parts of the news-gathering establishment are about celebrities encroaching on their field. Clinton, never one to miss an opportunity to show his Hollywood credentials, jumped at the chance of a light grilling on his environmental record from Hollywood's principal boy. When rumours of the DiCaprio audience filtered out, David Westin, head of ABC News, declared in a memo to reporting staff that no one was 'that stupid' as to send an actor to interview the President for the network. The following day it turned out that Westin's superiors were indeed 'that stupid'. </p> <p>ABC anchormen Sam Donaldson and others promptly protested against any use of the DiCaprio interview on the channel. Sunshine laughs off the very public internal wrangling. 'In truth, it probably helped. Controversy is good. A lot of people know he [DiCaprio] is chairman of Earth Day now.' </p> <p>And presumably the organisers of Earth Day would concur. The argument for using celebs to raise the profile of issues is that it is a shorthand way to get a serious cause on the front of a newspaper. </p> <p>A case in point is Michael Douglas's recent trip to Britain to argue the case against nuclear proliferation. Douglas, a UN ambassador, was afforded many of the trappings of a state visit; an audience with the Foreign Secretary and a chance to lecture the Commons on disarmament. Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain gushed over Douglas in the manner of an Oxford Union president revealing his latest coup: 'You reach a part of public opinion which MPs, Ministers and nuclear anoraks have no chance of reaching,' he told Douglas. 'Can I congratulate you for inspiring a mass turn-out of MPs. They would not have come to hear me.' </p> <p>Did the arrival of Douglas really raise the issue of disarmament - or was its effect, however altruistically intended, simply to add a caring, committed layer to the actor's profile? Sting, a veteran of such arguments, who once appeared on Wogan in the company of a Yamomamo Indian, has argued: 'Celebrity is often a lead weight around your neck. It's like pointing at the moon, but people are looking at your finger.' </p> <p>Dennis Hayes, who has co-ordinated Earth Day 2000 in the 30 years since its inception, suggested that his only reservations about DiCaprio were that 'he is the best actor of his generation, and you always wonder, is this the real thing, or another performance?'</p> <p> It seems the great actor's skills let him down during his afternoon at the White House.

      "body": "<p>Smart apartments good clothes, gallery openings... the only British films set against this sort of backdrop tend to be lightweight comedies starring Hugh Grant, which are immediately picketed by Socialist Worker. But wise French film-makers know that smart apartments and good clothes do not automatically condemn the characters that possess them to frothy plots involving farcical weddings, or runaway Hollywood stars. The French understand that some bourgeois window-dressing does not preclude the possibility of edgy human drama. </p> <p>In All Innocence, adapted from a novel by Georges Simenon, is the latest addition to the genre. It's about Cecile, a scrubberish teenager (played by Virginie Ledoyen), and the effect she has on a smart Parisian lawyer (G\u00e9rard Lanvin). So far, so May to December. But thanks to Carole Bouquet, who plays the lawyer's wife Viviane, an extra dimension is added.</p> <p>If one scene sticks in your head afterwards, it will be the scene in which Viviane - who at the beginning of the movie is coolly, wryly indulgent of her husband's interest in the girl - recognises that her 18-year marriage is over. Perhaps my view has been unfairly influenced by Bouquet's other role as a 'face' of Chanel, or by her stint as a Bond girl, but she is astonishing in this scene: raw, untethered, and terribly disturbing. </p> <p>Bouquet, 42, is much heartier in person than you might imagine from her gallery of reserved, porcelain-pale roles. 'My characters always start well in movies,' she says, in her energetic and idiosyncratic English, her long gold earrings pirouetting with every shrug. </p> <p>'Almost every movie I've done starts with a happy marriage, it's all beautiful, wealthy, whatever... and then of course my husband leaves me, and everything falls apart.' She laughs, boisterously. 'They've been doing it to me for 20 years.' </p> <p>Perhaps the most memorable example came in Trop Belle Pour Toi, when she played G\u00e9rard Depardieu's impossibly beautiful wife. In the end, alienated by her perfection, the Depardieu character runs off with his fat secretary. What is more unlikely: that, or the fact that five years ago, she and Depardieu (who first worked together in 1979 on Buffet Froid) got together in real life? </p> <p>In fact, this odd couple - the horny-handed man-mountain and the soign\u00e9e actress with the Chanel wardrobe - appear to have plenty in common: kids (they have a grand total of five children from previous relationships) and wine, for starters. </p> <p>Depardieu has just directed and acted opposite her in a forthcoming, untitled film. 'I've acted with him many times, and it's always the same pleasure, but I was anxious the day before. I knew G\u00e9rard wouldn't be completely aware of what I was doing, because he was acting with me as well as directing. So I was afraid that he wouldn't be looking at me dispassionately enough, not as much as if he was just sitting on a chair and thinking, \"God, she's bad.\"' </p> <p>Every so often, you hear a comment like this and realise that beneath the assured exterior is a far more hesitant creature. In 1977, having stumbled almost by accident into drama school, Bouquet was plucked out to star in That Obscure Object of Desire. Of course this was a stroke of luck, but it was also a curse. </p> <p>'During the Bu\u00f1uel, I was so scared, I really thought I was incapable of doing it. Every day I thought Bu\u00f1uel would look at the dailies and say, \"You're hopeless\", and fire me. But instead he was saying, \"Oh, that's fine, very nice.\" I thought he was lying, he was making the best of it. It was a PURE NIGHTMARE. I thought for years and years I was an imposter. I was completely paranoid that one day, everyone would recognise this.' </p> <p>The film that finally gave her confidence, as opposed to stripping it away, was 1981's Le Jour Des Idiots, but she still seems quite tough on herself. 'This new thing about liking yourself,' she adds, 'I find that absolutely appalling. Anyone who likes themselves, I just can't go too close to them. To me it's pure stupidity. But having some peace with yourself, that's quite a relief.' </p> <p>Bouquet was two and her sister seven when their mother walked out of the family home north of Paris. The two little girls were raised by their father, a businessman. 'He was a nice man, but not happy,' she says now. 'If there had been some joy and happiness in the house, that would have been fine. But nobody was coming to our house, there were never any guests, so I was bored, watching TV all the time, looking at stupid things.' </p> <p>She has only recently understood why her mother simply abandoned her two daughters. Though they are not exactly close ('You can't get close to a mother you didn't grow up with'), they talk. 'I guess my mother felt so guilty because she was the one who wanted to leave. At that time, you thought you were a bitch for leaving - you didn't like yourself, as a woman or a mother. And she gave up.

      "bodyText": "Smart apartments good clothes, gallery openings... the only British films set against this sort of backdrop tend to be lightweight comedies starring Hugh Grant, which are immediately picketed by Socialist Worker. But wise French film-makers know that smart apartments and good clothes do not automatically condemn the characters that possess them to frothy plots involving farcical weddings, or runaway Hollywood stars. The French understand that some bourgeois window-dressing does not preclude the possibility of edgy human drama. In All Innocence, adapted from a novel by Georges Simenon, is the latest addition to the genre. It's about Cecile, a scrubberish teenager (played by Virginie Ledoyen), and the effect she has on a smart Parisian lawyer (G\u00e9rard Lanvin). So far, so May to December. But thanks to Carole Bouquet, who plays the lawyer's wife Viviane, an extra dimension is added. If one scene sticks in your head afterwards, it will be the scene in which Viviane - who at the beginning of the movie is coolly, wryly indulgent of her husband's interest in the girl - recognises that her 18-year marriage is over. Perhaps my view has been unfairly influenced by Bouquet's other role as a 'face' of Chanel, or by her stint as a Bond girl, but she is astonishing in this scene: raw, untethered, and terribly disturbing. Bouquet, 42, is much heartier in person than you might imagine from her gallery of reserved, porcelain-pale roles. 'My characters always start well in movies,' she says, in her energetic and idiosyncratic English, her long gold earrings pirouetting with every shrug. 'Almost every movie I've done starts with a happy marriage, it's all beautiful, wealthy, whatever... and then of course my husband leaves me, and everything falls apart.' She laughs, boisterously. 'They've been doing it to me for 20 years.' Perhaps the most memorable example came in Trop Belle Pour Toi, when she played G\u00e9rard Depardieu's impossibly beautiful wife. In the end, alienated by her perfection, the Depardieu character runs off with his fat secretary. What is more unlikely: that, or the fact that five years ago, she and Depardieu (who first worked together in 1979 on Buffet Froid) got together in real life? In fact, this odd couple - the horny-handed man-mountain and the soign\u00e9e actress with the Chanel wardrobe - appear to have plenty in common: kids (they have a grand total of five children from previous relationships) and wine, for starters. Depardieu has just directed and acted opposite her in a forthcoming, untitled film. 'I've acted with him many times, and it's always the same pleasure, but I was anxious the day before. I knew G\u00e9rard wouldn't be completely aware of what I was doing, because he was acting with me as well as directing. So I was afraid that he wouldn't be looking at me dispassionately enough, not as much as if he was just sitting on a chair and thinking, \"God, she's bad.\"' Every so often, you hear a comment like this and realise that beneath the assured exterior is a far more hesitant creature. In 1977, having stumbled almost by accident into drama school, Bouquet was plucked out to star in That Obscure Object of Desire. Of course this was a stroke of luck, but it was also a curse. 'During the Bu\u00f1uel, I was so scared, I really thought I was incapable of doing it. Every day I thought Bu\u00f1uel would look at the dailies and say, \"You're hopeless\", and fire me. But instead he was saying, \"Oh, that's fine, very nice.\" I thought he was lying, he was making the best of it. It was a PURE NIGHTMARE. I thought for years and years I was an imposter. I was completely paranoid that one day, everyone would recognise this.' The film that finally gave her confidence, as opposed to stripping it away, was 1981's Le Jour Des Idiots, but she still seems quite tough on herself. 'This new thing about liking yourself,' she adds, 'I find that absolutely appalling. Anyone who likes themselves, I just can't go too close to them. To me it's pure stupidity. But having some peace with yourself, that's quite a relief.' Bouquet was two and her sister seven when their mother walked out of the family home north of Paris. The two little girls were raised by their father, a businessman. 'He was a nice man, but not happy,' she says now. 'If there had been some joy and happiness in the house, that would have been fine. But nobody was coming to our house, there were never any guests, so I was bored, watching TV all the time, looking at stupid things.' She has only recently understood why her mother simply abandoned her two daughters. Though they are not exactly close ('You can't get close to a mother you didn't grow up with'), they talk. 'I guess my mother felt so guilty because she was the one who wanted to leave. At that time, you thought you were a bitch for leaving - you didn't like yourself, as a woman or a mother. And she gave up. The law was my father, saying: \"That's the way it's going to be.\" He always told her what to do: put that there, do this. It took me a long time to understand that the reason was because she could not fight back.' Between the ages of 14 and 16, she barely went to school. Instead, she played truant at the cinema. It all sounds very Bovaryesque. 'I didn't give a damn, I was just loving it. Three films a day. I was so bored at that time. Dreaming, dreaming, all the time, of how life could be. Through those years, it was movies who taught me things. Most of it was very good wisdom, to tell you the truth, because that's what you have in movies. Most of them are very moral, in fact.

He appeared as a tutelary figure in Tim Burton's Ed Wood . There has been a TV movie built around his notorious 1938 radio version of War of the Worlds that persuaded thousands of listeners that America was being invaded by Martians, and a few months ago there was another TV film about the scandals attendant on his first Hollywood film, Citizen Kane , in 1941. </p> <p>Now with the exhilarating Cradle Will Rock, Tim Robbins tells what the credits call 'A [Mostly] True Story' about the sensational production of Marc Blitzstein's Brechtian agitprop musical, The Cradle Will Rock, in 1937 by the federally subsidised theatre company called Project 891 that Welles and John Houseman ran in New York. It's for people who wince at the implications of the phrase 'he's history'. </p> <p>The film is a sort of dialectical mosaic that attempts to do for the 1930s what E.L. Doctorow's Ragtime did for the decade before the First World War. To achieve this, Robbins brings together three key events of the decade. The first is the commissioning in 1932 by enlightened plutocrat Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack) of a vast mural for the Rockefeller Center by the revolutionary Mexican artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades). In early 1934, before being unveiled, the work known as Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future was ground to dust because of its inflammatory radical character, though Rivera later re-created it in Mexico City. </p> <p>The second event is the appearance in December 1938 of Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones), the formidable head of the Federal Theatre, before the newly formed House Committee on Un-American Activities (Huac), a philistine organisation. This hearing, in which Flanagan ran rings around her Red-hunting interrogators, helped bring about the end of federal funding for the arts that had been launched as part of President Roosevelt's New Deal in 1934. </p> <p>Robbins has moved the Rivera affair ahead in time by three years, and the Huac hearings back by 18 months so that they exactly coincide with the extraordinary first performance of The Cradle Will Rock at a rundown Broadway theatre, the Venice. Project 891's own theatre had been suddenly closed and sealed by security guards following a federal economy drive aimed at radical artists. Because the actors' and musicians' unions refused to sanction a performance elsewhere, Houseman and Welles - in the ultimate realisation of the show-must-go-on ethos - mounted it as a one-man show with the composer Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria) at the piano. Members of the cast, wearing rehearsal clothes, gradually joined in from their seats in the audience following the courageous example of the inexperienced young actress Olive Stanton, a figure so amazing and so affectingly played by Emily Watson that one might suppose that Robbins invented her. He did not. </p> <p>Robbins works on as vast a canvas as Rivera's tendentious political mural, and with a comparably sharp, visual shorthand, caricaturing and glorifying in a similarly provocative manner. Rockefeller, Hearst and their oligarchic circle, buying up Old Masters, encouraging Nazis and fascists as a bulwark against communism, scheming to prevent a second American Revolution, are mocked. </p> <p>Hallie Flanagan, the sane non-communist with a vision of creating a genuine national theatre, is the heroine of the piece, along with Olive Stanton and an anti-fascist Italian-American actor played by John Turturro. Somewhere in between, the haughty Houseman (Cary Elwes) product of an English public school, and the histrionic Welles (Angus MacFadyen), in search of glory, are treated with a gentle humour. </p> <p>Over dinner at a fashionable restaurant after rehearsing a gritty musical about the overthrow of capitalism, the pair bicker like a married couple. Blitzstein's mentor, Bertolt Brecht, has a walk-on part, appearing in the composer's imagination to criticise and advise, and there is a touching, presumably fictitious character, an alcoholic vaudeville ventriloquist played brilliantly by Bill Murray, whose dummy takes over from him, making left-wing jokes and singing the 'Internationale'. The Huac politicians are given the rope of their official transcript with which to hang themselves. </p> <p>Cradle Will Rock closes with an image of the tame, unchallenging, neon-lit Times Square of today. It opens with a wonderful sequence announcing both a new dawn and a backstage story set against the background of a turbulent era. </p> <p>First seen stretched out behind a cinema screen, the homeless, unemployed Olive Stanton is literally awoken from sleep and figuratively awakened to politics. As she dresses, a newsreel carries items about the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the Nazis' exhibition of Decadent Art in Germany, Roosevelt opening a dam as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority, a fashion parade in Florida. Going out into the world, she washes her face at a fire hydrant as the camera pans up to the apartment where Blitzstein is struggling with his opera. </p> <p>The movie continues with a similar fluidity, cutting between its different narrative strands, introducing a vast array of people, vividly recreating a point in American life as the Depression is moving into the pre-war era. It's a time of hope and despair and the movie's final sequence cuts between a mock funeral, a theatrical celebration, and a party of capitalists in fancy dress discussing how to hang on to power. </p> <p>In an entertaining, if at times simplified manner (Robbins makes too light of communism), the picture examines the relationship between art and society.

In 1981 Spielberg told 28-year-old Kennedy, then his PA, that she would produce his next movie, a relatively low-budget fantasy about a boy and an alien called ET. </p> <p>During the Eighties they quietly made enough blockbusters to rival \u00fcber-producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. The couple left Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment team in 1991, but wisely have kept their association with Hollywood's most successful director. </p> <p>So are they the only people in Hollywood who can to say no to Spielberg? 'Umm, yeah,' hesitates Kennedy. 'I don't look at it as saying no. The producer is there to create the director's vision...' Marshall says: 'Everyone needs a sounding board, a person you can trust and whose opinions you can trust.' </p> <p>Today, if this personable middle-aged couple, who finish each other's sentences, return your calls, you must be a player. </p> <p>'At first people expected and offered us similar blockbuster movies to the ones we had made with Steven, but we were not interested in trying to make the same movie over and over again,' says Kennedy. 'It's still difficult for us to raise the money. I think it's easy to get backing for an $80 million tentpole movie than a $8m small one.' The pair have gravitated towards 'riskier' films of late, but balance their slate. Next year Kennedy will take charge of Jurassic Park 3, while Marshall will direct his fourth film, an action-adventure film called The Expendables - ' Dirty Dozen under the sea'. But the project that will keep Internet chat rooms buzzing is AI, the Kubrick sci-fi project that Spielberg will now head and Kennedy produce. </p> <p> The Sixth Sense 's Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law have signed up and Kennedy is excited. 'It's going to be a very interesting kind of collaboration. Stanley commissioned a load of artwork to design the look of the film and Steven will use that. Their vision of the film was very similar and they did correspond a lot. I remember when we were shooting Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom 15 years ago and Stanley was really impressed by Steven's ideas about the film.' </p> <p>Last year they pulled off the classic double - huge grosses and Oscar nominations for The Sixth Sense . Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's clever script was one of the most sought-after in town. But he decided to go with Kennedy-Marshall because he grew up on their films. </p> <p>'Night told us he had posters on the wall of his office from ET and Raiders . He said he always wanted to work with the people with their names on those posters.' They didn't win any Oscars but Bruce Cohen, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and godfather to their daughter, produced American Beauty. 'We knew we had no chance but it was nice to keep it in the family,' says Marshall. In London to attend the Baftas ceremony they saw their rival triumph again. However, the morning after they're only upset because presenter Jack Docherty revealed the surprise ending to The Sixth Sense. </p> <p>They're unhappy too about the fate of their latest film, Snow Falling on Cedars , a deliberately paced drama set during a shameful period of US history, the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War. Directed by Scott Hicks (Shine) and starring Ethan Hawke, it got lukewarm reviews and its US box-office failure clearly rankles. 'The film never got a chance. It didn't catch on in the first weekend and so it didn't stay long enough in the cinemas,' says Marshall. 'These days it's like an election. You know the morning after whether you've won or not.' </p> <p>An ambivalent attitude towards Hollywood emerges. They feel at odds with the establishment to which they obviously belong. They speak of a new breed of executives who number crunch but don't recognise references to classic movies. </p> <p>'These days movies are made by people who don't really like films,' says Kennedy. 'It can be very depressing.' Ironically, the type of blockbuster films they are famous for are often blamed for the decline in Hollywood's standards. Their response? 'I don't know how to evaluate that criticism,' laughs Kennedy. 'People like to look at all different kinds of movies,' says Marshall. 'People want to go and be entertained so there is room for both Raiders and American Beauty . </p> <p>'They are all different kinds of movies, but whatever we do I want to make movies that people go and see.' </p> <p>\u0095 Snow Falling on Cedars opens on 12 May</p>",

'At first people expected and offered us similar blockbuster movies to the ones we had made with Steven, but we were not interested in trying to make the same movie over and over again,' says Kennedy. 'It's still difficult for us to raise the money. I think it's easy to get backing for an $80 million tentpole movie than a $8m small one.' The pair have gravitated towards 'riskier' films of late, but balance their slate. Next year Kennedy will take charge of Jurassic Park 3, while Marshall will direct his fourth film, an action-adventure film called The Expendables - ' Dirty Dozen under the sea'. But the project that will keep Internet chat rooms buzzing is AI, the Kubrick sci-fi project that Spielberg will now head and Kennedy produce. The Sixth Sense 's Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law have signed up and Kennedy is excited. 'It's going to be a very interesting kind of collaboration. Stanley commissioned a load of artwork to design the look of the film and Steven will use that. Their vision of the film was very similar and they did correspond a lot. I remember when we were shooting Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom 15 years ago and Stanley was really impressed by Steven's ideas about the film.' Last year they pulled off the classic double - huge grosses and Oscar nominations for The Sixth Sense . Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's clever script was one of the most sought-after in town. But he decided to go with Kennedy-Marshall because he grew up on their films. 'Night told us he had posters on the wall of his office from ET and Raiders . He said he always wanted to work with the people with their names on those posters.' They didn't win any Oscars but Bruce Cohen, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and godfather to their daughter, produced American Beauty. 'We knew we had no chance but it was nice to keep it in the family,' says Marshall. In London to attend the Baftas ceremony they saw their rival triumph again. However, the morning after they're only upset because presenter Jack Docherty revealed the surprise ending to The Sixth Sense. They're unhappy too about the fate of their latest film, Snow Falling on Cedars , a deliberately paced drama set during a shameful period of US history, the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War. Directed by Scott Hicks (Shine) and starring Ethan Hawke, it got lukewarm reviews and its US box-office failure clearly rankles. 'The film never got a chance. It didn't catch on in the first weekend and so it didn't stay long enough in the cinemas,' says Marshall. 'These days it's like an election. You know the morning after whether you've won or not.' An ambivalent attitude towards Hollywood emerges. They feel at odds with the establishment to which they obviously belong. They speak of a new breed of executives who number crunch but don't recognise references to classic movies. 'These days movies are made by people who don't really like films,' says Kennedy. 'It can be very depressing.' Ironically, the type of blockbuster films they are famous for are often blamed for the decline in Hollywood's standards. Their response? 'I don't know how to evaluate that criticism,' laughs Kennedy. 'People like to look at all different kinds of movies,' says Marshall. 'People want to go and be entertained so there is room for both Raiders and American Beauty . 'They are all different kinds of movies, but whatever we do I want to make movies that people go and see.' \u0095 Snow Falling on Cedars opens on 12 May",

On 30 April, a few hours after the last chopper fled, North Vietnamese tanks crashed the Presidential Palace gates and seized what was left of a terribly mutilated but reunited country. In the US the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fall of Saigon might be slipping by quietly in official circles. But documentary film-makers have certainly been paying attention. </p> <p>Three fine new documentaries neatly illustrate the range of views that the war now provokes. Return With Honor , bankrolled by arms contractor Boeing-McDonnell, celebrates 'top guns' who literally were above it all until a flak burst or missile picked them off. 'We were flying Sir Lancelots,' one rueful pilot muses. 'All of a sudden you're not that any more and you're scared.' The film-makers opted to tell the saga based on 'the PoWs' mindset at the time,' which was (and is) staunchly militaristic.

Soon, in an undeclared war, Alvarez found himself captured, labelled a criminal and under torture for eight and a half years. </p> <p>Such experiences did not foster dissent. As film-maker Terry Sanders explains, captivity was hardly the time for macho officers to re-examine whether America ought to be there: 'If the President said to do this or that, then that was the thing to do.' So US fliers, who come across as brave and sincere, endured excruciating cruelties to force them to say far less, as one resentfully remarks, than sceptical politicians were saying out loud at home.

The film-makers' decision to embrace the PoWs' point of view pays off with a claustrophobically intense narrative. </p> <p>Conduct was no daintier down South. Vietcong captives were shoved out of helicopters without parachutes and tens of thousands of political prisoners suffered gruesomely at the hands of the corrupt regime. In Regret To Inform, a Vietnamese survivor attests that in the mangled multitude of free-fire zones: 'If you were not dead, you were not safe.' Another Vietnamese widow remembers her shock at her family home being obliterated by bombs, her six-year-old cousin killed by a nervous US soldier (and the soldier's horrified expression), and her self-hating bar-girl life afterwards. Writer-director Barbara Sonneborn, on her mournful but gripping train journey across Vietnam, explores 'the point of view of Vietnam war widows from both sides of the conflict' in hope of prying further open her audience's compassion. </p> <p>Vietnam is not just a war but a country and a beautiful one at that. In Vietnam - Long Time Coming , the task that the makers of Hoop Dreams, the documentary about aspiring basketball players, set themselves was to show how jittery veterans come to terms with this emotionally healing fact. The documentary tracks US and Vietnamese war veterans pedalling bicycles (for the intact), hand cycles (for paraplegics) and tandem bikes (for the blind) 1,200 miles from Hanoi to the city formerly known as Saigon. 'It could have been worse,' a grinning vet remarks. 'Someone could have been shooting at us.' </p> <p> For army nurse Diane Evans, the airliner's descent into Hanoi evoked 'the same gut-wrenching feeling as when I first flew into Tan Son Nhut 30 years ago. Vietnam was like a year-long hallucination.' This time the passengers were greeted by pretty girls offering flowers. 'It was the perfect gesture,' said Jerry Stadtmiller, a blinded ex-Marine. 'The [flower] gave me something to hold, other than my white cane. When you first came here you were handed an M-16.' </p> <p>The party visit a school, a hospital and Hanoi's tomb of the unknown soldier. 'We discussed the wreath [for the tomb] beforehand,' said Wade Sanders, who commanded a Swift Boat on the Mekong River in 1968-69 and later was Assistant Secretary of the Navy. 'We had no problem doing it in the spirit of veteran honouring veteran.' </p> <p>Pigeonholing vets such as Sanders is a perilous enterprise. In a seemingly strident screen moment he states that he was not ashamed of anything he did in Vietnam. So is he a rabid hawk ? 'I didn't approve of the war,' Sanders, who is running for a congressional seat in San Diego, says. 'I was saying that I didn't do anything I was ashamed of. Everyone I killed was trying to kill me.' As for the legacy of Vietnam, Evans said the government, 'sent 18- and 19-year-olds to Vietnam and it mistreated them after the war. I think it's unhealthy and harmful to trust your government. You should always question their agenda and their decisions. We were led like sheep in the 1960s.' </p> <p>Kartemquin films, makers of Long Time Coming, hope their documentary will be shown in secondary schools and 'open up space for students to ask relatives who were Vietnam vets about how they felt'. 'There is a certain way society has processed this hero stuff so that the people, who are much more complex, felt constricted about how they expressed how they really felt about it,' Gordon Quinn, founder of Kartemquin, notes. 'We go to war so lightly. Before Clinton bombs Iraq or Serbia or any place else he ought to stand in front of the Vietnam memorial wall in Washington. It's a very powerful place.' </p> <p>\u0095 The three documentaries will preview at film festivals later this year.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Charting the swift rise of soccer in the US.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In The Simpsons episode The Cartridge Family , in which soccer comes to Springfield and Homer ends up buying a gun, the story opens with a man in a cowboy hat appearing on the Simpsons' TV screen, barbecuing a soccer ball and screaming, 'Open wide for soccer!' </p> <p>It turns out that the Continental Soccer Association is coming to Springfield. 'It's all here - fast-kicking, low-scoring and ties? You bet!' says the announcer. 'This game will determine once and for all which nation is the greatest on earth: Mexico or Portugal.' </p> <p>So the Simpsons troop over to Springfield Stadium, where the sign reads: 'Tonight: Soccer, Tomorrow: Monsters of Poetry.' Homer is very excited. 'Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win,' he says. The game starts and one side passes the ball interminably around midfield. </p> <p>The Hispanic commentator grows hysterical with excitement, but the Springfield crowd is gripped by tedium. To give themselves something to do, people start fighting. Soon there are riots all over town, the mayor declares a state of emergency, and Homer buys a gun. </p> <p>The episode originally ran in 1997, but was apparently made sometime earlier, and the remarkable thing is how dated it now seems. In the last few years, the game that turned the Simpsons off has invaded American popular culture. Some examples: last year's high school movie She's All That , in which the school hero transforms a geeky girl into the Prom Queen, is traditional except for the fact that the school hero is the soccer captain. In The Sopranos , the TV mafia soap opera, a centrepiece of the plot is a girls' soccer match. In The Simpsons itself, Bart has been revealed as a soccer goalkeeper. </p> <p>How swift the rise of soccer has been is best illustrated by Matt Damon's recent career. In the 1997 film Good Will Hunting , Damon shoots hoops. Two years later, in Dogma , the only sport mentioned is soccer (Damon, a renegade angel, says it is more exhausting than genocide). </p> <p>Politics, which in the US is above all a branch the entertainment industry, has also been swamped by soccer. This began at the 1996 election,where the main debate was about which way the Soc cer Moms would vote, and peaked last summer when Clinton all but adopted the US women's soccer team. Oscar Goodman, a veteran mafia lawyer, ran for mayor of Las Vegas last year with a television advertisement that showed pictures of his four children, and ended with a shot of Goodman and his wife above the caption: 'We never missed a soccer game.' He was elected. </p> <p>The strange thing is that while soccer makes its way into TV and the movies, the professional game in the US remains unwatched. On Wednesday I went to see the New York/New Jersey MetroStars play the Kansas City Wizards in Giants Stadium. When I got there, I found Lothar Matth\u00e4us, Mo Johnston and the Colombian Adolfo Valencia playing before a crowd of less than 8,000. Yet it is precisely because professional soccer has remained a joke that the sport could conquer America. The Soccer Moms, Oscar Goodman's voters, the kids who watched She's All That, like the fact that soccer is not a big professional game like basketball or American football. </p> <p>Many Americans are getting fed up with big professional sports. In Britain we think our football stars are spoiled and overpaid because Stan Collymore lets off a fire extinguisher. In America, sports stars murder people. The Moms like soccer, because, in their eyes, it is a little game. It is not violent, not drenched in money, and not very black. Many professional players earn barely enough to keep themselves (to some, the daily allowance on road trips is a godsend), and most of them are middle-class white college boys and girls. That plays well in places like Springfield </p> <p>And so, amazingly, soccer has become an emblem of America. Twenty years ago, when I was a child in California listening to baseball matches on the radio, that seemed unthinkable. Between innings they used to play an advertising jingle that went, 'Baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet - life the American way!' </p> <p>Today the equivalent ad would be for Volvo, would probably rhyme 'American way' with 'decaf latte', and would feature soccer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In The Simpsons episode The Cartridge Family , in which soccer comes to Springfield and Homer ends up buying a gun, the story opens with a man in a cowboy hat appearing on the Simpsons' TV screen, barbecuing a soccer ball and screaming, 'Open wide for soccer!' It turns out that the Continental Soccer Association is coming to Springfield. 'It's all here - fast-kicking, low-scoring and ties? You bet!' says the announcer. 'This game will determine once and for all which nation is the greatest on earth: Mexico or Portugal.' So the Simpsons troop over to Springfield Stadium, where the sign reads: 'Tonight: Soccer, Tomorrow: Monsters of Poetry.' Homer is very excited. 'Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win,' he says. The game starts and one side passes the ball interminably around midfield. The Hispanic commentator grows hysterical with excitement, but the Springfield crowd is gripped by tedium. To give themselves something to do, people start fighting. Soon there are riots all over town, the mayor declares a state of emergency, and Homer buys a gun. The episode originally ran in 1997, but was apparently made sometime earlier, and the remarkable thing is how dated it now seems. In the last few years, the game that turned the Simpsons off has invaded American popular culture. Some examples: last year's high school movie She's All That , in which the school hero transforms a geeky girl into the Prom Queen, is traditional except for the fact that the school hero is the soccer captain. In The Sopranos , the TV mafia soap opera, a centrepiece of the plot is a girls' soccer match. In The Simpsons itself, Bart has been revealed as a soccer goalkeeper. How swift the rise of soccer has been is best illustrated by Matt Damon's recent career. In the 1997 film Good Will Hunting , Damon shoots hoops. Two years later, in Dogma , the only sport mentioned is soccer (Damon, a renegade angel, says it is more exhausting than genocide). Politics, which in the US is above all a branch the entertainment industry, has also been swamped by soccer. This began at the 1996 election,where the main debate was about which way the Soc cer Moms would vote, and peaked last summer when Clinton all but adopted the US women's soccer team. Oscar Goodman, a veteran mafia lawyer, ran for mayor of Las Vegas last year with a television advertisement that showed pictures of his four children, and ended with a shot of Goodman and his wife above the caption: 'We never missed a soccer game.' He was elected. The strange thing is that while soccer makes its way into TV and the movies, the professional game in the US remains unwatched. On Wednesday I went to see the New York/New Jersey MetroStars play the Kansas City Wizards in Giants Stadium. When I got there, I found Lothar Matth\u00e4us, Mo Johnston and the Colombian Adolfo Valencia playing before a crowd of less than 8,000. Yet it is precisely because professional soccer has remained a joke that the sport could conquer America. The Soccer Moms, Oscar Goodman's voters, the kids who watched She's All That, like the fact that soccer is not a big professional game like basketball or American football. Many Americans are getting fed up with big professional sports. In Britain we think our football stars are spoiled and overpaid because Stan Collymore lets off a fire extinguisher. In America, sports stars murder people. The Moms like soccer, because, in their eyes, it is a little game. It is not violent, not drenched in money, and not very black. Many professional players earn barely enough to keep themselves (to some, the daily allowance on road trips is a godsend), and most of them are middle-class white college boys and girls. That plays well in places like Springfield And so, amazingly, soccer has become an emblem of America. Twenty years ago, when I was a child in California listening to baseball matches on the radio, that seemed unthinkable. Between innings they used to play an advertising jingle that went, 'Baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet - life the American way!' Today the equivalent ad would be for Volvo, would probably rhyme 'American way' with 'decaf latte', and would feature soccer.",

      "body": "<p> I drove through a heavy mist up into the Espinha\u00e7o mountains in search of what Aleijadinho - the 'Brazilian Michelangelo' - had left behind. Most people are drawn towards these blue-tinged peaks for what they can dig out of them. It was profits from one of the world's richest gold strikes here that financed Aleijadinho's acclaimed sculptures. And two centuries later, mining still dominates life in this Brazilian state, as big as France, whose name, Minas Gerais, means 'General Mines'. </p> <p>But I was pulled here by Aleijadinho's life story. I had heard it was 'perfectly South American', which I took to mean both heroic and tragic, but never far from surreal. </p> <p>The same outpouring of gold had created my first destination, his birthplace: Ouro Preto (black gold), a town which began as a lawless mining camp, clinging to the steep rocks which held the metal. </p> <p>Ouro Preto's miners set high standards in quaffing the national firewater, cacha\u00e7a , scrapping with cutlasses and lusting after the Western Hemisphere's greatest congregation of prostitutes. But afterwards they fell on their knees before God, with a devotion that echoes in Brazilians today. </p> <p>The miners formed brotherhoods, competing to commission the most spectacular church. Artists heard the call of patronage and flocked from all points of the compass to create barroco mineiro style - creamy white exteriors, the churches framed by twin bell towers and filled with a lavish explosion of gilded decor. Ouro Preto blossomed into a baroque architectural feast. </p> <p>Three centuries later, Ouro Preto is still clinging on, and is so perfectly preserved that the United Nations has named it a site of World Cultural Heritage. Inevitably, the seams that for decades gave the world half its new gold ran dry. The population slumped from more than 100,000 (then twice the size of New York) to 20,000. But back in the Thirties the Brazilian President, knowing a national monument when he saw one, ordered that nothing be touched. </p> <p>Its time-frozen appearance and its people's quiet demeanour make this a Brazil far from Copacabana beach or the Amazon, a reminder of how varied this vast country is. Not just Ouro Preto, but any of the three neighbouring colonial towns - Mariana, Sabar\u00e1 or Congonhas - are well worth the journey of between five and six hours by car or bus from Rio or S\u00e3o Paulo. Or you could trust yourself to taxi driver, Fatimo Valerio, who told me: 'Give me four hours and you will arrive rested and content.' </p> <p>Rudely peeling bells woke me the next day, but the compensation was a view of Our Lady of Carmo, a church where Aleijadinho spent 40 years adding touches such as the lined face of St Simon transfixed by celestial ecstasy. </p> <p>I was a guest at the Pouso do Chico Rei, a small eighteenth century guesthouse, where a night in a room with original furnishings and a severely sloping floor costs about \u00a335. You may also make friends in the shared bathroom and practise your Portuguese, as both Elba, the 93-year-old owner, and her assistants, pride themselves in not speaking any foreign languages. </p> <p>Luckily, they spoke slowly enough to give me the basic elements of the story of Ouro Preto's most famous son. Aleijadinho means 'the little cripple'. He was born as Ant\u00f3nio Francisco Lisboa to a Portuguese mason and a black slave woman some time around 1730. </p> <p>Leprosy struck him as a young man, 'but this didn't shake him in his faith - he knew God wanted him to sculpt', Elba's cook, Janete, told me, in a matter-of-fact way that suggested everyone should have such a sense of vocation. When the affliction claimed his toes and the use of his legs, he demanded to be wheeled on a wooden trolley into the churches where he worked. When it took his fingers, he had his tools strapped to his wrists. </p> <p>Aleijadinho was f&amp;234;ted and in spite of his low birth his work commanded enormous fees. But when the gold ran out, Brazil's Michelangelo declined alongside his town, eventually dying in the tradition of great artists, penniless and blind. He is buried a few yards from where he was born, a simple headstone by the altar in Concei\u00e7\u00e3o church. </p> <p>That evening I wandered off into the steeply cobbled streets, perfumed by wood smoke, in search of entertainment. Ouro Preto is quiet, apart from the barking dog that seems to inhabit every South American small town. But I discovered that it is in fact home to several thousand students from the national mining university. </p> <p>In tucked away basement bars, the devotees of the Escola de Minas couldn't have been friendlier. Over cacha\u00e7a, they relished trying out their English on me, inquired after our coal mines and told me a story to rival Aleijadinho for magical realism. It was the tale of Chico Rei, after whom Elba named her guesthouse, the king of an African tribe sold in its entirety as slaves to an Ouro Preto mine owner. </p> <p> With Chico Rei as foreman, the tribe eventually amassed enough gold to purchase their freedom. The official version puts the amassing down to the mine owner paying out minuscule bonuses, which they saved over many years. 'Not true,' said Jo\u00e3o, a 22-year-old would-be mining engineer from nearby Belo Horizonte, emphatically. 'The female miners kept gold dust in their hair, and later washed it out for Chico Rei.' </p> <p>Chico's people went on to buy the Encardadeira mine, struck a lucky seam and soon enjoyed their own fountain of wealth. The mine can still be visited, but Jo\u00e3o's friend Dorotea warned: 'The roof may fall sometimes and there are also problems with ghosts.' </p> <p>The tribe gave thanks for their fortune by building a church dedicated to Efig\u00eania, a Nubian queen. (Checking up on the story the next morning I ducked into Santa Efig\u00eania's dimly lit interior, and picked out wooden carvings of African-looking fauna, before noticing that I was being watched over by a smiling black pope from the ceiling.) </p> <p>But by reverting to African dress and customs, Chico's tribe outraged the King of Portugal so much that he prohibited slaves from buying their freedom. Chico Rei is still a folk hero to poor Brazilian blacks today. </p> <p>The following day I set off on the meandering 20 miles to the town of Congonhas, hoping to see Aleijadinho's most famous work, the Twelve Prophets . In a reverse of anywhere else, while the old gold towns are stopped in time, the countryside rushes towards 'progress'. </p> <p>Today's mining is the strip version, ripping giant chunks of iron-laden red earth out of the hillside. Stopping for a view of the carnage, I met Gilberto Ribeiro, a stocky ex-miner in his forties. 'These mountains will have disappeared in 20 years,' he said, while we watched hand-painted lorries groaning under the weight of their ore. </p> <p>I thought that might be an exaggeration, but that was no reason not to hear some of Gilberto's mining tales over mineira cooking, which was delivered to us with quiet mountain cordiality at a roadside stall. The cuisine has the weight of high-altitude food, but thankfully includes tasty indigenous vegetables such as spinach-like couve and quiabe beans. Vegetarians should not experiment with feij\u00e3o tropeiro (mule drivers' black beans), which may be livened up with pigs' ears, tails and snouts. </p> <p> 'I worked on a smaller scale, chasing topaz with my pick,' Gilberto recounted, 'never dynamite - I've lost too many friends through accidents.' What Gilberto chased most was imperial topaz, which he was pleased to tell me could only be found here or in a town in Russia whose name was 'too hard to pronounce'. </p> <p>But he had no Chico Rei stories of good fortune. 'In my mining days I never knew anyone who started poor and ended up other than equally poor or injured.' Now he is happier working in construction. </p> <p>Gilberto's new trade is booming. One new development, not far from the stall where we ate, showed more of the changing face of Minas Gerais. Alphaville is an enclave of identical modern houses behind a high wall and a bored armed guard. The rich no longer try to spend their way into public respect or heavenly entrance, as in the days when they poured fabulous sums into putting up Ouro Preto's 32 churches, the colonial sobrado mansions of Mariana or the grandeur of Sabar\u00e1's opera house. </p> <p>They won't be likely to encourage another Aleijadinho, preferring their culture to come on satellite television or shopping trips to Miami. At Congonhas the morning clouds departed the sky on cue to reveal Aleijadinho's Twelve Prophets, standing guard life-size outside the deserted Bom Jesus de Matozinhos church. </p> <p>In fact these figures, staring menacingly out over a broad valley, have faces not from the Old Testament but those of a band of mineiros that rebelled against Portuguese rule in Aleijadinho's time, for which they were all beheaded or exiled. Their leader was Tiradentes ('the Toothpuller'), commemorated as a patriot with a grand column in Ouro Preto's main square. </p> <p>The rebel resemblances don't deter the half a million Catholic pilgrims who trek to Bom Jesus in the second week of every September to make promises and do penance. Finally meeting the Prophets after generous helpings of rebellion stories back at Ouro Preto and with my Old Testament knowledge a little hazy, for me the link with the toothpuller actually improved them. </p> <p>All 12 carry messages, six of love, six of threat. They are eerily alive, petrified in mid-rant but still quite able to instil the fear of something like God into those who view them. At the same time, misspelled Latin phrases (taught to Aleijadinho by a local ex-Jesuit bandit) seem for some reason to breathe more life into their making. </p> <p> The Prophets were cut by Aleijadinho when his leprosy was at its worst. Records say the pain was so severe that the sculptor would sometimes hack away at the offending limb with his chisel until his loyal assistants stayed his hand. </p> <p>We can only be grateful for his perseverance, fuelled by his Bible and anatomy books and by the effect that these mountains seem to have in driving people to extremes. Perhaps it was the altitude, but I found that, despite all I heard beforehand, the grace, realism and power of what remains of Aleijadinho's creations does indeed still take the breath away.

      "byline": "Kate Mikhail",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>To spit or not to spit? Wine tasting has always conjured up two overriding images: either you spit, or you get embarrassingly drunk. Tucked away in the dark, cavernous depths of a wine cellar, however, with glass held appreciatively to nose, and a spittoon lurking in the shadows, flashbacks to the Ab-Fab excesses of Patsy and Edina, as they lurched, legless from vineyard to car with wine-splattered faces, helped me decide. Today, I resolved, would be a day of sipping. </p> <p>Marie-Claire, wife of Jean and mother of Christophe, whose names appear alongside that of Le Domaine de la Perri\u00e8re vineyard, was chattering about the history of the place, which has been in the family for five or six generations; the difficulty of finding workers for the harvest season - 'It's hard work. They would rather stay unemployed than work here' - and the nuances of the different wines, two of which have been named after her grandchildren. </p> <p>Jean Baudry, the head of the family which owns the vineyard just east of Chinon, had made a brief appearance - long enough to take off his cap and issue a gruff welcome before striding off to get on with the business of growing grapes. At which point, Marie-Claire stepped forward to take on the role of front of house. Thousands of wine bottles stretched temptingly into the distance. Marie-Claire ceremoniously lined up three wine glasses to carry three different vintages and, suddenly, what was a grey, rainy day in the Loire Valley took a turn for the better. </p> <p>The British have a bad name when it comes to wine tasting, or at least they used to have. After downing the free wines on offer, they would buy one bottle and walk, earning them the shameful nickname 'the one bottles'. Rule number one: if you're visiting a vineyard, you should expect to carry away at least half a dozen bottles. Other basic tips include: always phone beforehand to check opening hours; avoid lunchtime (noon-2pm); and try to put the odd French sentence together. It will be appreciated. </p> <p>You can't walk 10 paces without tripping over a vineyard in the Loire and the chance of stumbling across a good one par hasard is far from guaranteed. So, before heading off blindly in the direction of this wine-drenched belt, do some research. Ask someone in the know, or buy a decent wine guide such as the Guide Hachette des Vins. </p> <p>Driving down from northern France had been a pleasure in itself: straight Roman roads slicing ahead to the horizon, flanked by picture-postcard villages, busy allotments, tiny vineyards, fields of sunflowers and maize and regimented tree farms with their unnatural, though dramatic, measured grids. </p> <p>I'd chosen five vineyards strung out between Chinon and Angers, which I thought could be visited in a day, but was being over optimistic. Wine tasting is all about knowing what exactly is in the bottle and this, of course, takes time. And there are the distractions en route. Churches, chateaux and farm signs left and right with tempting adverts for fresh farm produce: fruit, veg, flowers and trout ready to be stunned and gutted on demand. </p> <p>It is also easy to get waylaid while tootling through medieval villages. Troglodyte homes beckon from the rocky hills above Montsoreau, outside Saumur, and cafes, restaurants and ancient village centres all make a play for your attention. Candes-St-Martin is particularly picturesque, with its milky white stone buildings and its twelfth-century church, set back from the narrow main road up a sweeping flight of broad, shallow cobblestone steps. A restaurant sits to the left of the arched entrance, while the air is alive with house martins which have stuck their mud huts in the nooks of the porch's vaults. Inside, canned Gregorian chants lend a slightly cheesy air to what is otherwise a beautiful interior built on the site where Saint Martin died in 397. </p> <p>The fourteenth-century chateau in Saumur could also lure you, attention-grabbing as it is hovering above town, perched high on sixteenth-century fortifications. Part fortress and part turreted fairytale castle, the chateau, which has served as both barracks and prison, has a great panorama over the river and gardens that are worth a visit. </p> <p>Worryingly for the local economy, the popularity of the chateaux of the Loire Valley has plummeted in the past decade. Since 1989, visitors have dropped by up to 35 per cent, and only the really enterprising chateaux that put on pageants and son et lumi\u00e8res are attracting enough visitors. This is why, or so I was told, the narrow, winding roads that weave through Loire villages are now often blissfully empty, when in times past tourist-filled cars crawled nose to tail. </p> <p>Vineyard number two, Couly-Dutheil, in the centre of Chinon, had clearly been recommended for its wine rather than its ambience. More cash-and-carry than a characterful family-run business, the only reminder that this was a family affair was a large black-and-white photograph on the wall of all the male members of the family, down to the youngest sitting in a basket of grapes, and the face of the young toddler once again superimposed on a bottle of wine on the counter. Driving into the courtyard, I had been relieved to see two Brits stashing box after box into their boot - no 'one-bottles' here, thank God. </p> <p>Time was running out, and driving round in circles in Chinon asking passers-by for directions had not helped, which meant that the list of five had to be slashed to three. Luckily, the Domaine de Nerleux, south-east of Saumur, proved to be a good vineyard to end on. </p> <p>An imposing stone gateway welcomes you into an immaculate, spacious courtyard. Head towards the eighteenth-century converted barn on your right and you'll be met by a simple, wooden bar and a list of the wines on offer. If your written French is up to scratch, there's a helpful board with 'les trois \u00e9tapes pour d\u00e9terminer et appr\u00e9cier les qualit\u00e9s des vins' - these being the look of it, the smell of it and the taste of it. </p> <p>Owner R\u00e9gis Neau, was dealing with an order for several thousand bottles for export. He is a handsome, happy man who clearly loves his job, and is at one with his comfortable surroundings where he was born, as were his father and grandfather. His family history and that of the vineyard are inextricably linked. And the labyrinthian cellars under the courtyard with its ancient wine press, where his grandfather worked without electricity or running water, is an evocative time capsule - history made tangible. </p> <p>The 100-acre vineyard has been in the family for eight generations and is a modest affair with eight full-time members of staff. Valerie, the secretary, is one minute behind the bar and the next back stage feeding bottles into the labelling machine. </p> <p>Wine tasting has a lot to recommend it. It's an enjoyable day out, you avoid the hit-or-miss quality of buying blind and once you've found what you like you can re-order over the phone and have the wine delivered. </p> <p>The busiest months for wine-buying visitors are May to June and October to December, and there are a lot of English doing the rounds these days. So, are we still a nation of 'one bottles', I ask? 'I met one once,' Valerie concedes, 'but he was on a bicycle.' </p> <p>\u0095 Jean and Christophe Baudry, Domaine de la Perri\u00e8re, Cravant-les-Coteaux, 37500 Chinon (00 33 247 93 15 99); Couly-Dutheil, 12 rue Diderot, 37502 Chinon (00 33 247 97 20 20); Domaine de Nerleux, 4, rue de la Paleine, Saint-Cyr-en-Bourg (00 33 241 51 61 04)</p>",

Marie-Claire ceremoniously lined up three wine glasses to carry three different vintages and, suddenly, what was a grey, rainy day in the Loire Valley took a turn for the better. The British have a bad name when it comes to wine tasting, or at least they used to have. After downing the free wines on offer, they would buy one bottle and walk, earning them the shameful nickname 'the one bottles'. Rule number one: if you're visiting a vineyard, you should expect to carry away at least half a dozen bottles. Other basic tips include: always phone beforehand to check opening hours; avoid lunchtime (noon-2pm); and try to put the odd French sentence together. It will be appreciated. You can't walk 10 paces without tripping over a vineyard in the Loire and the chance of stumbling across a good one par hasard is far from guaranteed. So, before heading off blindly in the direction of this wine-drenched belt, do some research. Ask someone in the know, or buy a decent wine guide such as the Guide Hachette des Vins. Driving down from northern France had been a pleasure in itself: straight Roman roads slicing ahead to the horizon, flanked by picture-postcard villages, busy allotments, tiny vineyards, fields of sunflowers and maize and regimented tree farms with their unnatural, though dramatic, measured grids. I'd chosen five vineyards strung out between Chinon and Angers, which I thought could be visited in a day, but was being over optimistic. Wine tasting is all about knowing what exactly is in the bottle and this, of course, takes time. And there are the distractions en route. Churches, chateaux and farm signs left and right with tempting adverts for fresh farm produce: fruit, veg, flowers and trout ready to be stunned and gutted on demand. It is also easy to get waylaid while tootling through medieval villages. Troglodyte homes beckon from the rocky hills above Montsoreau, outside Saumur, and cafes, restaurants and ancient village centres all make a play for your attention. Candes-St-Martin is particularly picturesque, with its milky white stone buildings and its twelfth-century church, set back from the narrow main road up a sweeping flight of broad, shallow cobblestone steps. A restaurant sits to the left of the arched entrance, while the air is alive with house martins which have stuck their mud huts in the nooks of the porch's vaults. Inside, canned Gregorian chants lend a slightly cheesy air to what is otherwise a beautiful interior built on the site where Saint Martin died in 397. The fourteenth-century chateau in Saumur could also lure you, attention-grabbing as it is hovering above town, perched high on sixteenth-century fortifications. Part fortress and part turreted fairytale castle, the chateau, which has served as both barracks and prison, has a great panorama over the river and gardens that are worth a visit. Worryingly for the local economy, the popularity of the chateaux of the Loire Valley has plummeted in the past decade. Since 1989, visitors have dropped by up to 35 per cent, and only the really enterprising chateaux that put on pageants and son et lumi\u00e8res are attracting enough visitors. This is why, or so I was told, the narrow, winding roads that weave through Loire villages are now often blissfully empty, when in times past tourist-filled cars crawled nose to tail. Vineyard number two, Couly-Dutheil, in the centre of Chinon, had clearly been recommended for its wine rather than its ambience. More cash-and-carry than a characterful family-run business, the only reminder that this was a family affair was a large black-and-white photograph on the wall of all the male members of the family, down to the youngest sitting in a basket of grapes, and the face of the young toddler once again superimposed on a bottle of wine on the counter. Driving into the courtyard, I had been relieved to see two Brits stashing box after box into their boot - no 'one-bottles' here, thank God. Time was running out, and driving round in circles in Chinon asking passers-by for directions had not helped, which meant that the list of five had to be slashed to three. Luckily, the Domaine de Nerleux, south-east of Saumur, proved to be a good vineyard to end on. An imposing stone gateway welcomes you into an immaculate, spacious courtyard. Head towards the eighteenth-century converted barn on your right and you'll be met by a simple, wooden bar and a list of the wines on offer. If your written French is up to scratch, there's a helpful board with 'les trois \u00e9tapes pour d\u00e9terminer et appr\u00e9cier les qualit\u00e9s des vins' - these being the look of it, the smell of it and the taste of it. Owner R\u00e9gis Neau, was dealing with an order for several thousand bottles for export. He is a handsome, happy man who clearly loves his job, and is at one with his comfortable surroundings where he was born, as were his father and grandfather. His family history and that of the vineyard are inextricably linked. And the labyrinthian cellars under the courtyard with its ancient wine press, where his grandfather worked without electricity or running water, is an evocative time capsule - history made tangible. The 100-acre vineyard has been in the family for eight generations and is a modest affair with eight full-time members of staff. Valerie, the secretary, is one minute behind the bar and the next back stage feeding bottles into the labelling machine. Wine tasting has a lot to recommend it. It's an enjoyable day out, you avoid the hit-or-miss quality of buying blind and once you've found what you like you can re-order over the phone and have the wine delivered. The busiest months for wine-buying visitors are May to June and October to December, and there are a lot of English doing the rounds these days. So, are we still a nation of 'one bottles', I ask? 'I met one once,' Valerie concedes, 'but he was on a bicycle.' \u0095 Jean and Christophe Baudry, Domaine de la Perri\u00e8re, Cravant-les-Coteaux, 37500 Chinon (00 33 247 93 15 99); Couly-Dutheil, 12 rue Diderot, 37502 Chinon (00 33 247 97 20 20); Domaine de Nerleux, 4, rue de la Paleine, Saint-Cyr-en-Bourg (00 33 241 51 61 04)",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> My voice wobbled and my hands shook as I faced my boss, Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, across his office table and resigned. Not to work for another paper, nor for a bit more money, but to go to a foreign country where I didn't speak the language or know anyone, to try to arrange a world heavyweight title fight between Felix Savon and Mike Tyson. </p> <p>Don King had failed to do it with a $25 million contract in his pocket at the Cuban training camp before the Mexico Olympics. I had a credit limit (recently raised to \u00a32,500) and \u00a32,000 in travellers' cheques. At least Don Quixote had Sancho Panza to talk to on his trip. </p> <p>I didn't even have an obsession with the country, or with Cuban boxing, or with any particular Cuban boxer. I wish I could say that I had dedicated my spare time to clipping out articles about Savon or Teofilo Stevenson, but my only scrapbook contains Everton's full results, teams and match reports between 1978 and 1981, perhaps the least interesting and most unsuccessful era in the club's post-war history. </p> <p>Communism leaves me cold, though I did have that red-and-black Che Guevara poster above my bed when I was in the Harrogate branch of the Workers' Socialist League back in the early Eighties. No, if I take the chain of events back before that Monday morning, I ended up spending a year in Cuba because I needed some serious time off work. </p> <p>It all started when I went on holiday for the first time in two years. January 1996 was freezing, that damp, in-your-nose sort of cold London specialises in. The Northern Line wasn't working, the coffee machine at work was empty, my love life was in a coma, I was having a bad day and I decided I needed a holiday. </p> <p>Why Cuba? Well, like all decisions that change your life, I can't claim that I thought very hard about it at the time. Guilt maybe? Two years earlier I had split up with my Spanish girlfriend, Beatriz. I told her, crassly, I needed to be with someone who understood the subtleties of the English language. When I decided to go to Cuba for a holiday, that remark kept banging around my head. I had to make some amends to Beatriz. </p> <p> But it was just a holiday, it wasn't a life- changing decision, or so I thought at the time. It was a butterfly flapping its wings in one corner of my life. </p> <p>I landed in Havana on 20 February, 1996. My nine-hour journey had lasted 36 hours because of a punctured tyre on the plane. Cubana, the national airline, had to put me and the other 167 passengers up in the Stansted Hilton because no one at the air port would allow it any credit or lend it a tyre. Stepping off the jet in Cuba felt like walking into a badly ventilated laundrette. </p> <p>I stayed with a Cuban family, who were well-to-do and terrified of everything. Allergic to any activity other than staying at home and watching television, they kept their son off school (about 300 yards away) if it was raining. Every time I asked them how I could arrange to do something, Miguel, the head of the house, would shake his head in awe at my stupidity. 'Let me explain you something about Cuba ...' he would say, and a sad diatribe about the inadvisability of leaving the house would follow. </p> <p>I asked him once if I could get a ticket for a baseball match. 'Let me explain you,' he said. 'Now is very bad time, with planes being shot down, and the atmosphere is very, very tense. The crowd will be bad. Everyone is very nervous, and you will probably not get a ticket, and transport here in Cuba is very, very difficult. Why not watch it on the TV?' </p> <p>Miguel was scared because the Cubans had just shot down two planes flown over Havana by the Brothers to the Rescue, anti-Castro dissidents from Miami. Miguel was afraid the police would be jumpy and bombs might be planted in reprisal. Fortunately, for a Brit like me, the politics of Northern Ireland make you fairly sanguine. </p> <p> I went to the baseball anyway, figuring that I could cope with a bit of bad 'atmosphere' in Havana. And I could get a ticket from a tout. I knew what Miguel did not want to admit: that you can buy anything for dollars in Havana. When I got to the Estadio Latinoamericano, there were no touts for the simple reason that the entry cost three pesos (about 8p). </p> <p>The atmosphere in the 40,000-seat stadium was considerably less tense than bingo night at Walton Women's Institute because there were, at most, 900 people there. And transport home was a cakewalk. I stood looking confused at a road junction for a second and a bloke stopped and gave me a lift for the price of a one-zone London bus ride. </p> <p>On top of the baseball I discovered the Buler\u00eda, a small nightclub in which women, most of them prostitutes, paw you as you walk to the bar. It was not something that had happened to me before. I found the Care Cantante, a higher-class club. I found respite from the attentions of prostitutes in the Sunday-afternoon, Cubans-only disco at the otherwise hooker-infested Hotel Commodoro, and I found a soccer team to play with. </p> <p>I travelled in old American cars; was hassled by men and women alike ('Hey, you, my friend, where you from!'); had the worst steak and chips of my life in the best surroundings, at the top of a tower in central Havana; drank too much rum; smoked too many filterless black-tobacco Populars (less of a cigarette, more a state-assisted suicide scheme); walked for miles around the city, awed by its beaten-up buildings and bleached beauty, and at the range of women, from supermodel drop-dead gorgeous to the overweight with an inexplicable fondness for lurid Lycra catsuits, the most popular of which was crafted fraternally of the Stars and Stripes. </p> <p>It was a fantastic time and I fell in love with Havana. I even started to be understood in Spanish. I began to wonder what it would be like to live there. So I decided to go back only two months later, in April, with what I thought would be a more critical eye. </p> <p>On this occasion the plane left on time. And I arrived on schedule in Havana airport's Terminal Two. There were only about 15 flights a day from the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International, but they reckoned they needed three terminals (one international, one Caribbean, one internal). </p> <p>Everyone piled off the plane and walked to a well-appointed Soviet-style concrete shed which housed Immigration, a row of booths in front of which you queue. They are chest-high, flimsy wooden constructions, with a glass pane from waist to head height and a wooden shelf on the inside so you can't see what the man behind the counter is doing with his hands. Next to each booth is a chest-high wooden door, which swings open once you are deemed worthy of entry. There were 12 of them, each staffed by a uniformed officer, with Ministerio del Interior sewn untidily on to his bright green, crumpled combat shirt. </p> <p>Imagine the least 'customer-oriented' dole officer you have ever signed on for, the one who looks at you as though the only thing he hates more than his job is you. Add the sort of nightclub bouncer who you sense would rather be at home dismembering small woodland creatures, slowly, with a blunt knife, than assisting in your enjoyment of the evening. Then multiply by the most authoritarian, cane-happy PE and geography teacher and throw in a doctor's waiting room full of traffic wardens and park attendants. Stick on a black moustache. That's him. </p> <p>His is the first face seen by visitors to Cuba, who are a generally affable lot, oozing with goodwill towards the slightly risqu\u00e9 holiday destination they have chosen, but jolly happy to be here (and at least there won't be any Americans). Above all, you are left with the impression, once you have been stamped and approved and the wooden door swings open, that you are entering a country which considers you an enemy. </p> <p> The flat I was staying in was pleasant enough: hottish water, clean, but penned in by other blocks. Next door was so close that it would have been easier to ask my new neighbour for the salt than go to my own kitchen. And I discovered one of the negative sides of Cuba, that the invention of volume control has totally passed the nation by. A Cuban TV set is either on or off, and the same principle applies to the volume: with no carpets and the windows open, if the programme can't be heard in the next postcode the set needs adjusting. </p> <p>Cuban friends say the top-volume trick is a habit from the more paranoid days of the revolution when people wanted to talk politics and didn't want the neighbours to hear. But Cubans are noisy in pretty much everything that they do. There is a gaggle of men in the Parque Central every day, shouting at each other as though they have all just discovered that everyone else in the group has slept with his wife. All they are in fact doing is discussing baseball, the supposed national obsession which so few people in Havana bother to go to watch. It says something about Cubans that they consider it more fun to shout and argue with each other than actually do anything. It may even explain why the government survives. </p> <p>There are three things which everybody thinks they know about Cuba. The first is that the island produces excellent cigars rolled on the thighs of beautiful maidens. They are indeed excellent. Having been around a few cigar factories, I now know that they are rolled on a wooden table by hand, and the people who roll them are men and women of widely varying ages and degrees of desirability. They're about as romantic as fish-processing plants in Grimsby, only with more sunshine. </p> <p>The second is that Cuba is the last bastion of communism, the embers of the greatest social experiment in human history, but one which still has great education and health systems. In Latin American terms, the education's not bad at all, compulsory, well organised and free. There is no child labour in Cuba. But its quality has been ravaged by a lack of resources, teachers and textbooks. </p> <p> Despite that, literacy levels are high and everyone has a chance to go to university for free, provided they can put up with the pre-university requirements that they work for a period of time in the countryside and pass a course in Marxism-Leninism. </p> <p>The hospitals are there, in greater numbers than in many Latin countries. The doctors are well trained and of high calibre and their services are free. But there is little modern equipment and only the doctors' diagnostic skills prevent the system from collapsing completely. </p> <p>But to talk about communism is to talk about Fidel Castro. Everything about him seems mythical, and this aura is fed by the myriad failures to kill or replace him. The stories about the CIA's attempts to topple him are endless: how they concocted a boot polish which they thought would make his beard fall out, removing his magical hold over the population. The attempt to slip him an exploding cigar is celebrated, along with the rest of these pitiful schemes in the Interior Ministry's museum in Miramar, where the cigar in question, successfully defused, now resides. </p> <p>It is said the CIA discovered a weakness in his elaborate security procedures: he visited the same ice-cream stall every day at the same time. They paid the woman who worked there to poison him. When Castro turned up, the woman took the phial of poison out of the fridge only for her to shake so violently that she dropped it on the floor, where it smashed. These stories, and his longevity, add to the sense on the streets of Havana, as much as in Washington, that Castro has a pact with the Devil. </p> <p>The third thing people 'know' is that Cuba is good at sport: baseball, athletics and, of course, boxing. Cuba has produced some great boxers. Kid Chocolate, the little fighter in the Twenties who could stop traffic in Broadway.

I had considered starting a cultural centre, organising events to encourage friendly relations with Britain, teaching English cheaply, holding an annual festival maybe, a Beatles exhibition (the Beatles were banned in the Sixties, and Cubans are just catching up on them). But I didn't know anything about organising exhibitions or teaching English and, anyway, all of that would have relied on the generosity and desire for self-promotion of British companies, which were sensibly keeping their heads down as the United States sought to tighten the noose around Cuba.

I spoke to the chief sports writer and boxing correspondent of The Observer, Kevin Mitchell. We went to the local pub, the Coach and Horses, and sank a few Guinesses.

He told me more about Felix Savon, the Olympic heavyweight champion in 1992 and unbeatable, according to those who claim to know about these things.

Something fresh would be needed. By the end of the conversation, Kevin and I had decided we were the men to save heavyweight boxing.

      "bodyText": "My voice wobbled and my hands shook as I faced my boss, Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, across his office table and resigned. Not to work for another paper, nor for a bit more money, but to go to a foreign country where I didn't speak the language or know anyone, to try to arrange a world heavyweight title fight between Felix Savon and Mike Tyson. Don King had failed to do it with a $25 million contract in his pocket at the Cuban training camp before the Mexico Olympics. I had a credit limit (recently raised to \u00a32,500) and \u00a32,000 in travellers' cheques. At least Don Quixote had Sancho Panza to talk to on his trip. I didn't even have an obsession with the country, or with Cuban boxing, or with any particular Cuban boxer. I wish I could say that I had dedicated my spare time to clipping out articles about Savon or Teofilo Stevenson, but my only scrapbook contains Everton's full results, teams and match reports between 1978 and 1981, perhaps the least interesting and most unsuccessful era in the club's post-war history. Communism leaves me cold, though I did have that red-and-black Che Guevara poster above my bed when I was in the Harrogate branch of the Workers' Socialist League back in the early Eighties. No, if I take the chain of events back before that Monday morning, I ended up spending a year in Cuba because I needed some serious time off work. It all started when I went on holiday for the first time in two years. January 1996 was freezing, that damp, in-your-nose sort of cold London specialises in. The Northern Line wasn't working, the coffee machine at work was empty, my love life was in a coma, I was having a bad day and I decided I needed a holiday. Why Cuba? Well, like all decisions that change your life, I can't claim that I thought very hard about it at the time. Guilt maybe? Two years earlier I had split up with my Spanish girlfriend, Beatriz. I told her, crassly, I needed to be with someone who understood the subtleties of the English language. When I decided to go to Cuba for a holiday, that remark kept banging around my head. I had to make some amends to Beatriz. But it was just a holiday, it wasn't a life- changing decision, or so I thought at the time. It was a butterfly flapping its wings in one corner of my life. I landed in Havana on 20 February, 1996. My nine-hour journey had lasted 36 hours because of a punctured tyre on the plane. Cubana, the national airline, had to put me and the other 167 passengers up in the Stansted Hilton because no one at the air port would allow it any credit or lend it a tyre. Stepping off the jet in Cuba felt like walking into a badly ventilated laundrette. I stayed with a Cuban family, who were well-to-do and terrified of everything. Allergic to any activity other than staying at home and watching television, they kept their son off school (about 300 yards away) if it was raining. Every time I asked them how I could arrange to do something, Miguel, the head of the house, would shake his head in awe at my stupidity. 'Let me explain you something about Cuba ...' he would say, and a sad diatribe about the inadvisability of leaving the house would follow. I asked him once if I could get a ticket for a baseball match. 'Let me explain you,' he said. 'Now is very bad time, with planes being shot down, and the atmosphere is very, very tense. The crowd will be bad. Everyone is very nervous, and you will probably not get a ticket, and transport here in Cuba is very, very difficult. Why not watch it on the TV?' Miguel was scared because the Cubans had just shot down two planes flown over Havana by the Brothers to the Rescue, anti-Castro dissidents from Miami. Miguel was afraid the police would be jumpy and bombs might be planted in reprisal. Fortunately, for a Brit like me, the politics of Northern Ireland make you fairly sanguine. I went to the baseball anyway, figuring that I could cope with a bit of bad 'atmosphere' in Havana. And I could get a ticket from a tout. I knew what Miguel did not want to admit: that you can buy anything for dollars in Havana. When I got to the Estadio Latinoamericano, there were no touts for the simple reason that the entry cost three pesos (about 8p). The atmosphere in the 40,000-seat stadium was considerably less tense than bingo night at Walton Women's Institute because there were, at most, 900 people there. And transport home was a cakewalk. I stood looking confused at a road junction for a second and a bloke stopped and gave me a lift for the price of a one-zone London bus ride. On top of the baseball I discovered the Buler\u00eda, a small nightclub in which women, most of them prostitutes, paw you as you walk to the bar. It was not something that had happened to me before. I found the Care Cantante, a higher-class club. I found respite from the attentions of prostitutes in the Sunday-afternoon, Cubans-only disco at the otherwise hooker-infested Hotel Commodoro, and I found a soccer team to play with. I travelled in old American cars; was hassled by men and women alike ('Hey, you, my friend, where you from!'); had the worst steak and chips of my life in the best surroundings, at the top of a tower in central Havana; drank too much rum; smoked too many filterless black-tobacco Populars (less of a cigarette, more a state-assisted suicide scheme); walked for miles around the city, awed by its beaten-up buildings and bleached beauty, and at the range of women, from supermodel drop-dead gorgeous to the overweight with an inexplicable fondness for lurid Lycra catsuits, the most popular of which was crafted fraternally of the Stars and Stripes. It was a fantastic time and I fell in love with Havana. I even started to be understood in Spanish. I began to wonder what it would be like to live there. So I decided to go back only two months later, in April, with what I thought would be a more critical eye. On this occasion the plane left on time. And I arrived on schedule in Havana airport's Terminal Two. There were only about 15 flights a day from the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International, but they reckoned they needed three terminals (one international, one Caribbean, one internal). Everyone piled off the plane and walked to a well-appointed Soviet-style concrete shed which housed Immigration, a row of booths in front of which you queue. They are chest-high, flimsy wooden constructions, with a glass pane from waist to head height and a wooden shelf on the inside so you can't see what the man behind the counter is doing with his hands. Next to each booth is a chest-high wooden door, which swings open once you are deemed worthy of entry. There were 12 of them, each staffed by a uniformed officer, with Ministerio del Interior sewn untidily on to his bright green, crumpled combat shirt. Imagine the least 'customer-oriented' dole officer you have ever signed on for, the one who looks at you as though the only thing he hates more than his job is you. Add the sort of nightclub bouncer who you sense would rather be at home dismembering small woodland creatures, slowly, with a blunt knife, than assisting in your enjoyment of the evening. Then multiply by the most authoritarian, cane-happy PE and geography teacher and throw in a doctor's waiting room full of traffic wardens and park attendants. Stick on a black moustache. That's him. His is the first face seen by visitors to Cuba, who are a generally affable lot, oozing with goodwill towards the slightly risqu\u00e9 holiday destination they have chosen, but jolly happy to be here (and at least there won't be any Americans). Above all, you are left with the impression, once you have been stamped and approved and the wooden door swings open, that you are entering a country which considers you an enemy. The flat I was staying in was pleasant enough: hottish water, clean, but penned in by other blocks. Next door was so close that it would have been easier to ask my new neighbour for the salt than go to my own kitchen. And I discovered one of the negative sides of Cuba, that the invention of volume control has totally passed the nation by. A Cuban TV set is either on or off, and the same principle applies to the volume: with no carpets and the windows open, if the programme can't be heard in the next postcode the set needs adjusting. Cuban friends say the top-volume trick is a habit from the more paranoid days of the revolution when people wanted to talk politics and didn't want the neighbours to hear. But Cubans are noisy in pretty much everything that they do. There is a gaggle of men in the Parque Central every day, shouting at each other as though they have all just discovered that everyone else in the group has slept with his wife. All they are in fact doing is discussing baseball, the supposed national obsession which so few people in Havana bother to go to watch. It says something about Cubans that they consider it more fun to shout and argue with each other than actually do anything. It may even explain why the government survives. There are three things which everybody thinks they know about Cuba. The first is that the island produces excellent cigars rolled on the thighs of beautiful maidens. They are indeed excellent. Having been around a few cigar factories, I now know that they are rolled on a wooden table by hand, and the people who roll them are men and women of widely varying ages and degrees of desirability. They're about as romantic as fish-processing plants in Grimsby, only with more sunshine. The second is that Cuba is the last bastion of communism, the embers of the greatest social experiment in human history, but one which still has great education and health systems. In Latin American terms, the education's not bad at all, compulsory, well organised and free. There is no child labour in Cuba. But its quality has been ravaged by a lack of resources, teachers and textbooks. Despite that, literacy levels are high and everyone has a chance to go to university for free, provided they can put up with the pre-university requirements that they work for a period of time in the countryside and pass a course in Marxism-Leninism. The hospitals are there, in greater numbers than in many Latin countries. The doctors are well trained and of high calibre and their services are free. But there is little modern equipment and only the doctors' diagnostic skills prevent the system from collapsing completely. But to talk about communism is to talk about Fidel Castro. Everything about him seems mythical, and this aura is fed by the myriad failures to kill or replace him. The stories about the CIA's attempts to topple him are endless: how they concocted a boot polish which they thought would make his beard fall out, removing his magical hold over the population. The attempt to slip him an exploding cigar is celebrated, along with the rest of these pitiful schemes in the Interior Ministry's museum in Miramar, where the cigar in question, successfully defused, now resides. It is said the CIA discovered a weakness in his elaborate security procedures: he visited the same ice-cream stall every day at the same time. They paid the woman who worked there to poison him. When Castro turned up, the woman took the phial of poison out of the fridge only for her to shake so violently that she dropped it on the floor, where it smashed. These stories, and his longevity, add to the sense on the streets of Havana, as much as in Washington, that Castro has a pact with the Devil. The third thing people 'know' is that Cuba is good at sport: baseball, athletics and, of course, boxing. Cuba has produced some great boxers. Kid Chocolate, the little fighter in the Twenties who could stop traffic in Broadway. World champions such as Ultiminio Ramos, who tragically killed two men in the ring; Jos\u00e9 Mantequilla Napoles, who left after the revolution and fought out of Mexico to become a longstanding World Boxing Council middleweight champion; Luis Rodr\u00edguez, another boxer who left after the revolution, and had the misfortune to be on a plane which was hijacked and flown to Havana, while he was allegedly on a Cuban death list. Rodr\u00edguez survived and died a couple of years ago. Then there was Kid Gavilan, whose world championship welterweight bouts in the Fifties were massive events; Adolfo Horta, Angel Espinosa - and the heavyweight everyone was talking about now, Felix Savon. All this was in my mind when I came to think about how I could make a life in Cuba pay.

Britain's largest teaching union, the National Union of Teachers, is worried about pressure placed on teachers by the Ofsted process. Tomorrow, delegates at the annual NUT conference are expected to call for a 'vigorous campaign against the current Ofsted inspection regime and the discredited leadership of [Chief Inspector of Schools] Chris Woodhead'. John Bangs, head of education for the NUT, said: 'There is no longer any doubt that Ofsted screws people up.' He said growing realisation that inspection can have a devastating effect coincided with a shift in public perception of teachers, no longer written off as complacent whingers with long holidays. 'The atmosphere has completely changed,' he said. 'The public is tired of the Government and Ofsted blaming teachers for everything.' The case of 57-year-old Pamela Relf, reported in The Observer two weeks ago, has hit a nerve. The Cambridgeshire primary teacher who took her life at Christmas after an Ofsted inspector said her lessons 'lacked pace' has become a national cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. A fierce exchange of letters between Peter Smith, head of the association of Teachers and Lecturers, and Woodhead saw the Ofsted chief admitting he had failed to write to Relf's family to express condolences. The inspectorate also faces flak over its staff, with claims that incompetent, semi-literate inspectors cause havoc in schools, charges Woodhead once levelled at teachers. Primary school teachers James Patton, 29, and Janet Watson, 33, both hanged themselves before Ofsted visits because they were terrified they would fail. And 18 months ago an inquest heard that Jenny Knib, deputy of St Nicholas Combined School in Exeter, was driven to alcoholism and eventual death by her fear about an upcoming inspection. Over the past two weeks, The Observer has heard from dozens of teachers in response to articles about the death of Relf and the failed head who was an inspector on the team that assessed her school.

      "byline": "Mark Morris",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This might sound a little greedy. But after a period when Hollywood has surprised everyone with complex, intelligent movies, the time may be ripe for for the retrograde virtues of action, spectacle and noise. All of which are in abundance in the first 10 minutes of Gladiator: a Roman legion is attacked by a desperate barbarian army in a German forest. Archers fire blazing arrows, there are bloody cavalry charges, brutal close fighting and the confusion of battle. All rendered with every visual trick that Ridley Scott has. </p> <p>There's something both familiar and unfamiliar about Gladiator . The story is simple. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the favourite general of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). When the emperor dies, his twisted son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) orders Maximus to be killed. Maximus survives, is captured and enslaved and becomes a champion gladiator. It has most of the elements from the likes of Quo Vadis: a mad, incestuously-inclined emperor; honourable generals; camaraderie among gladiators; scheming senators; characters who speak with great portent (humourless people, these Romans). There's a massive baying Colosseum mob. Yet Gladiator is more brutal than any previous Roman movie: there are several decapitations and an excess of sprayed blood. A gladiator wets himself with fear. There are no Christians and - significantly - no orgies. The multicultural nature of the empire means gives a major part to an African-born actor, Djimon Hounsou. The main female character is neither a virtuous servant girl, nor a chillingly evil aristocrat. And at two and a half hours, Gladiator is a long film but a short epic. </p> <p>Central to the reinvention of the genre is the way it is filmed. It looks unmistakably like a Ridley Scott film; in fact, it looks more like the work of Ridley Scott than any of his films since Black Rain . At its worst, you are reminded of some very expensive ad. The cinematographer is John Mathieson, who worked on Plunkett and Macleane for Scott's son, Jake. And what was bold about that film was that it ignored the strange conventions that have built up around period film-making (someone insisted recently that you shouldn't use hand-held cameras for non-contemporary stories - why ever not?). The same theory runs through Gladiator , where photography of the battle scenes have more in common with Three Kings than Spartacus. </p> <p>But despite Scott, the film still relies on one actor. Gladiator confirms that Russell Crowe is one of the great movie stars of our time. Coming only months after his extraordinary performance as the paunchy, socially unskilled middle-aged Jeffrey Wigand in The Insider , here Crowe transforms himself into a hardened Spanish-born Roman general. Which brought a little clash between Crowe and Scott. 'My character was Spanish, and I wanted to do Antonio Banderas with better elocution,' Crowe claims, 'but they wouldn't let me. They didn't want people to be distracted by it.' Terrific actor that he is, Crowe's most important contribution to the film is an intangible quality: he looks as though he could survive in the arena. </p> <p>Until you see the film, it's hard to figure out why anyone would make this film now. After all, it is 36 years since Anthony Mann's The Fall Of The Roman Empire, the last of the great toga epics, which also told the story of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, played then by Alec Guinness and Christopher Plummer. A year later the genre was effectively ploughed into the ground by The Greatest Story Ever Told : more than four hours long, ill-prepared stars by the dozen, and John Wayne as a Roman centurion. It was a way of saying 'enough'. By then, the Hollywood staples were dying: the Western was in crisis and the classic musical was on its last legs. Like musicals, there were always good reasons not to make epics: they wereexpensive and nightmarish to stage. </p> <p>It was the historical epic that brought huge budgets to Hollywood: D.W. Griffith's insistence on rebuilding ancient Babylon larger than lifesize pushed the budget for Intolerance up to $2.5m - in 1914 - and left the director bankrupt. Bigger yet was the 1925 Ben-Hur, one of the most turbulent productions in the history of film. Shooting started in Italy, and then the whole set was rebuilt in the US. The director, star and writer were all replaced. Twenty galleons were built and destroyed. One hundred horses died in the four months it took to stage the chariot race (try getting away with that under today's laws). When it was all over it had cost $3.95m, which even now could pay for a decent film. Adjusted for inflation, it would come close to $130m - or rather more than the reputedly $100m Gladiator. </p> <p>After the coming of sound the epic was elbowed aside by gangster movies and screwball comedies. The epic returned after the war, in the age of Technicolor. These were the glory years of the splendidly wooden but perfectly muscular Victor Mature, in films like Samson And Delilah and The Robe . It was the Mature style that contributed to one of the things that undermined the Hollywood epic: the cheap and skin-heavy gladiator movies churned out in Italy by the directors and crews who would later make the spaghetti westerns. </p> <p>But throughout the Fifties, with Mature eventually being eclipsed by Charlton Heston, movies set in the ancient world thrived. And they had a particular dynamic to them: they always involved spectacular pagan decadence, the suggestion of untold wickedness portrayed in lavish detail - DeMille spent three weeks on the orgy scene of his 1956 version of The Ten Commandments . In order to fit with official US morality of the time, the heroes were always absurdly highly moral Christians or proto-Christian Jews. The films themselves often worked to undermine the surface message: it is impossible to watch Quo Vadis (1951) without feeling more kindly to Peter Ustinov's deliriously camp Nero than to Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr as the tiresomely virtuous Christians. </p> <p> Spartacus and The Fall Of The Roman Empire pushed things forward, losing the Christianity (and replacing it with Marxism in Spartacus ). But still, the early Sixties epic looked stiff, old-fashioned and unnecessarily long: the Heston Ben-Hur clocks in at 3 hours 37 minutes. The fiasco of Cleopatra (1963) didn't help. It remains - in real terms - the most expensive film ever made, and a study in wasting money. The original set was built in England, until someone worked out that the English weather was unsuitable for sun-baked Rome and Egypt. The whole production then shifted to Rome. And although audiences did flock to see the film, the horrors that went into creating its luxurious glory didn't encourage anyone to follow in its wake. </p> <p> Throughout the Sixties, movies acquired greater verisimilitude, encouraged by more location shooting. Which was trouble if you had to rebuild the Colosseum. 'The audience tolerance level in terms of reality is making it tougher and tougher,' says Ridley Scott. 'When you are doing a period movie there are no excuses any more.' It's hard now to believe that The Greatest Story Ever Told was made only two years before Bonnie And Clyde, or six years after A Bout De Souffle. The whole context around the epics collapsed rapidly: by 1968 Victor Mature had the Monkees playing dandruff in his hair in the frazzled, self-deconstructing Head , while Charlton Heston reinvented himself for the hippie era in Planet Of The Apes. </p> <p>So why are we looking at the return of the epic? Part of the reason is technical: although Gladiator does have the 'cast of thousands' and large sets, much of it is computer generated. A precursor comes in the pod race scene of The Phantom Menace, an open nod to Ben-Hur (incidentally, there's a strong Roman theme to the Lucas film, which is about a decadent aristocratic Senate conceding power to a man who will become emperor). Only the first tier of the Colosseum was actually built for Scott's film: the rest was filled in with computer-generated effects. The film was expensive, but not shockingly so. It is also never safe to write off Hollywood genres. </p> <p>Before Titanic, sinking ship movies weren't dominating the box office. And when was the last big swashbuckler before The Mask Of Zorro ? And like the swashbuckler, there's something about the Graeco-Roman blockbuster that's a bit more human than action films starring Schwarzenegger. </p> <p>Which makes it not surprising that the first-post Gladiator epic is already in the works. Michael Mann has commissioned two scripts: one is about Caesar and Pompey, the other is Gates Of Fire, from a novel about how 300 Spartans held of a huge Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae - George Clooney may produce and possible star. And another venture into the ancient world sounds like a good idea.</p>",

But after a period when Hollywood has surprised everyone with complex, intelligent movies, the time may be ripe for for the retrograde virtues of action, spectacle and noise. All of which are in abundance in the first 10 minutes of Gladiator: a Roman legion is attacked by a desperate barbarian army in a German forest. Archers fire blazing arrows, there are bloody cavalry charges, brutal close fighting and the confusion of battle. All rendered with every visual trick that Ridley Scott has. There's something both familiar and unfamiliar about Gladiator . The story is simple. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the favourite general of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). When the emperor dies, his twisted son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) orders Maximus to be killed. Maximus survives, is captured and enslaved and becomes a champion gladiator. It has most of the elements from the likes of Quo Vadis: a mad, incestuously-inclined emperor; honourable generals; camaraderie among gladiators; scheming senators; characters who speak with great portent (humourless people, these Romans). There's a massive baying Colosseum mob. Yet Gladiator is more brutal than any previous Roman movie: there are several decapitations and an excess of sprayed blood. A gladiator wets himself with fear. There are no Christians and - significantly - no orgies. The multicultural nature of the empire means gives a major part to an African-born actor, Djimon Hounsou. The main female character is neither a virtuous servant girl, nor a chillingly evil aristocrat. And at two and a half hours, Gladiator is a long film but a short epic. Central to the reinvention of the genre is the way it is filmed. It looks unmistakably like a Ridley Scott film; in fact, it looks more like the work of Ridley Scott than any of his films since Black Rain . At its worst, you are reminded of some very expensive ad. The cinematographer is John Mathieson, who worked on Plunkett and Macleane for Scott's son, Jake. And what was bold about that film was that it ignored the strange conventions that have built up around period film-making (someone insisted recently that you shouldn't use hand-held cameras for non-contemporary stories - why ever not?). The same theory runs through Gladiator , where photography of the battle scenes have more in common with Three Kings than Spartacus. But despite Scott, the film still relies on one actor. Gladiator confirms that Russell Crowe is one of the great movie stars of our time. Coming only months after his extraordinary performance as the paunchy, socially unskilled middle-aged Jeffrey Wigand in The Insider , here Crowe transforms himself into a hardened Spanish-born Roman general. Which brought a little clash between Crowe and Scott. 'My character was Spanish, and I wanted to do Antonio Banderas with better elocution,' Crowe claims, 'but they wouldn't let me. They didn't want people to be distracted by it.' Terrific actor that he is, Crowe's most important contribution to the film is an intangible quality: he looks as though he could survive in the arena. Until you see the film, it's hard to figure out why anyone would make this film now. After all, it is 36 years since Anthony Mann's The Fall Of The Roman Empire, the last of the great toga epics, which also told the story of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, played then by Alec Guinness and Christopher Plummer. A year later the genre was effectively ploughed into the ground by The Greatest Story Ever Told : more than four hours long, ill-prepared stars by the dozen, and John Wayne as a Roman centurion. It was a way of saying 'enough'. By then, the Hollywood staples were dying: the Western was in crisis and the classic musical was on its last legs. Like musicals, there were always good reasons not to make epics: they wereexpensive and nightmarish to stage. It was the historical epic that brought huge budgets to Hollywood: D.W. Griffith's insistence on rebuilding ancient Babylon larger than lifesize pushed the budget for Intolerance up to $2.5m - in 1914 - and left the director bankrupt. Bigger yet was the 1925 Ben-Hur, one of the most turbulent productions in the history of film. Shooting started in Italy, and then the whole set was rebuilt in the US. The director, star and writer were all replaced. Twenty galleons were built and destroyed. One hundred horses died in the four months it took to stage the chariot race (try getting away with that under today's laws). When it was all over it had cost $3.95m, which even now could pay for a decent film. Adjusted for inflation, it would come close to $130m - or rather more than the reputedly $100m Gladiator. After the coming of sound the epic was elbowed aside by gangster movies and screwball comedies. The epic returned after the war, in the age of Technicolor. These were the glory years of the splendidly wooden but perfectly muscular Victor Mature, in films like Samson And Delilah and The Robe . It was the Mature style that contributed to one of the things that undermined the Hollywood epic: the cheap and skin-heavy gladiator movies churned out in Italy by the directors and crews who would later make the spaghetti westerns. But throughout the Fifties, with Mature eventually being eclipsed by Charlton Heston, movies set in the ancient world thrived. And they had a particular dynamic to them: they always involved spectacular pagan decadence, the suggestion of untold wickedness portrayed in lavish detail - DeMille spent three weeks on the orgy scene of his 1956 version of The Ten Commandments . In order to fit with official US morality of the time, the heroes were always absurdly highly moral Christians or proto-Christian Jews. The films themselves often worked to undermine the surface message: it is impossible to watch Quo Vadis (1951) without feeling more kindly to Peter Ustinov's deliriously camp Nero than to Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr as the tiresomely virtuous Christians. Spartacus and The Fall Of The Roman Empire pushed things forward, losing the Christianity (and replacing it with Marxism in Spartacus ). But still, the early Sixties epic looked stiff, old-fashioned and unnecessarily long: the Heston Ben-Hur clocks in at 3 hours 37 minutes. The fiasco of Cleopatra (1963) didn't help. It remains - in real terms - the most expensive film ever made, and a study in wasting money. The original set was built in England, until someone worked out that the English weather was unsuitable for sun-baked Rome and Egypt. The whole production then shifted to Rome. And although audiences did flock to see the film, the horrors that went into creating its luxurious glory didn't encourage anyone to follow in its wake. Throughout the Sixties, movies acquired greater verisimilitude, encouraged by more location shooting. Which was trouble if you had to rebuild the Colosseum. 'The audience tolerance level in terms of reality is making it tougher and tougher,' says Ridley Scott. 'When you are doing a period movie there are no excuses any more.' It's hard now to believe that The Greatest Story Ever Told was made only two years before Bonnie And Clyde, or six years after A Bout De Souffle. The whole context around the epics collapsed rapidly: by 1968 Victor Mature had the Monkees playing dandruff in his hair in the frazzled, self-deconstructing Head , while Charlton Heston reinvented himself for the hippie era in Planet Of The Apes. So why are we looking at the return of the epic? Part of the reason is technical: although Gladiator does have the 'cast of thousands' and large sets, much of it is computer generated. A precursor comes in the pod race scene of The Phantom Menace, an open nod to Ben-Hur (incidentally, there's a strong Roman theme to the Lucas film, which is about a decadent aristocratic Senate conceding power to a man who will become emperor). Only the first tier of the Colosseum was actually built for Scott's film: the rest was filled in with computer-generated effects. The film was expensive, but not shockingly so. It is also never safe to write off Hollywood genres. Before Titanic, sinking ship movies weren't dominating the box office. And when was the last big swashbuckler before The Mask Of Zorro ? And like the swashbuckler, there's something about the Graeco-Roman blockbuster that's a bit more human than action films starring Schwarzenegger. Which makes it not surprising that the first-post Gladiator epic is already in the works. Michael Mann has commissioned two scripts: one is about Caesar and Pompey, the other is Gates Of Fire, from a novel about how 300 Spartans held of a huge Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae - George Clooney may produce and possible star. And another venture into the ancient world sounds like a good idea.",

Tall, slim with an air of imperiousness that has led his enemies in Northern Ireland to name him 'the Viceroy', Peter Mandelson is a man with a mission. And that mission is London.</p> <p>The rumour mill started to grind in earnest last Wednesday. A story in the Sun suggested that Mandelson was on his way back to the Department of Trade and Industry. Tony Blair wanted him back, the story said.</p> <p>'Twaddle' was the single-word response emanating from the Prime Minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>Then Mandelson made a speech. Not on the thorny issue of reviving the Northern Ireland Assembly, nor on the vexed issue of decommissioning or the problems with the IRA.</p> <p>No, Mandelson spoke about the euro. 'Whether we like it or not, our future is in Europe,' he told a business seminar.</p> <p>There was astonishment in many government circles. 'I assume there was a line about Northern Ireland in it,' said a disgruntled source, making it clear that the euro was the Chancellor Gordon Brown's business, not Mandelson's.</p> <p>The two events seemed to point in one direction. Mandelson was planning his return and Blair was on his side. The Prime Minister has already announced that Mandelson will head the general election campaign along with Brown. How Mandelson is supposed to do that and spend three days a week in Belfast is anybody's guess.</p> <p>Blair still relies heavily on Mandelson for advice about the way forward for the Labour Government, the broad themes that will keep the bandwagon rolling and the support on board.</p> <p>Speculation increased on Friday when senior Unionist sources revealed that David Trimble believes Mandelson will quit his post in July. At Sinn Fein, it was pointed out that it was the Unionists who first suggested Mandelson would replace Mo Mowlam as Northern Ireland Secretary last autumn. It was true.</p> <p>Sources close to Bertie Ahern's team in Dublin also said that they had 'received messages' that Mandelson was going. 'It's funny that at exactly this time of year a story does the rounds that Mandelson is moving on,' said a government source.</p> <p>There was more. Over the past three weeks Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff, has been taking a closer interest in the details of the Northern Ireland negotiations. The Prime Minister himself travelled to Northern Ireland last week to try to move the process along.</p> <p>'Sidelined would be too strong a word,' said an Irish government source. 'Maybe back seat would be closer.'</p> <p>One problem remains before the latest piece of Mandelson's complicated life-jigsaw is slipped into place. The Northern Ireland Assembly has to be up and running again if he is to be seen as a success. And he hates being seen as anything else.</p> <p>There is movement. On 2 May, the British and Irish governments are expected to launch a major diplomatic initiative, a last stab at resuscitating the Assembly before the 22 May deadline for decommissioning. When Mandelson was appointed last autumn it seemed Blair was desperate to bring his \u00e9minence grise back from purdah, and did so with undue haste, according to the Tories. It was in December the previous year that Mandelson had resigned over his home loan from fellow Minister Geoffrey Robinson.</p> <p>When Mandelson arrived, his big problem was his reputation as the Prince of Darkness, the Spin Doctor Uber Alles. How would he be able to deal with the sensitivities of a conflict that goes back generations?</p> <p>He seemed determined to show his mettle, and did so with two issues which he inherited: the setting up of the Assembly and the Patten report on the RUC. Mandelson got the glory for piloting through the former and is still struggling with the latter.

      "bodyText": "He is the spinmeister extraordinaire. He is the strategist's strategist. Tall, slim with an air of imperiousness that has led his enemies in Northern Ireland to name him 'the Viceroy', Peter Mandelson is a man with a mission. And that mission is London. The rumour mill started to grind in earnest last Wednesday. A story in the Sun suggested that Mandelson was on his way back to the Department of Trade and Industry. Tony Blair wanted him back, the story said. 'Twaddle' was the single-word response emanating from the Prime Minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell. Then Mandelson made a speech. Not on the thorny issue of reviving the Northern Ireland Assembly, nor on the vexed issue of decommissioning or the problems with the IRA. No, Mandelson spoke about the euro. 'Whether we like it or not, our future is in Europe,' he told a business seminar. There was astonishment in many government circles. 'I assume there was a line about Northern Ireland in it,' said a disgruntled source, making it clear that the euro was the Chancellor Gordon Brown's business, not Mandelson's. The two events seemed to point in one direction. Mandelson was planning his return and Blair was on his side. The Prime Minister has already announced that Mandelson will head the general election campaign along with Brown. How Mandelson is supposed to do that and spend three days a week in Belfast is anybody's guess. Blair still relies heavily on Mandelson for advice about the way forward for the Labour Government, the broad themes that will keep the bandwagon rolling and the support on board. Speculation increased on Friday when senior Unionist sources revealed that David Trimble believes Mandelson will quit his post in July. At Sinn Fein, it was pointed out that it was the Unionists who first suggested Mandelson would replace Mo Mowlam as Northern Ireland Secretary last autumn. It was true. Sources close to Bertie Ahern's team in Dublin also said that they had 'received messages' that Mandelson was going. 'It's funny that at exactly this time of year a story does the rounds that Mandelson is moving on,' said a government source. There was more. Over the past three weeks Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff, has been taking a closer interest in the details of the Northern Ireland negotiations. The Prime Minister himself travelled to Northern Ireland last week to try to move the process along. 'Sidelined would be too strong a word,' said an Irish government source. 'Maybe back seat would be closer.' One problem remains before the latest piece of Mandelson's complicated life-jigsaw is slipped into place. The Northern Ireland Assembly has to be up and running again if he is to be seen as a success. And he hates being seen as anything else. There is movement. On 2 May, the British and Irish governments are expected to launch a major diplomatic initiative, a last stab at resuscitating the Assembly before the 22 May deadline for decommissioning. When Mandelson was appointed last autumn it seemed Blair was desperate to bring his \u00e9minence grise back from purdah, and did so with undue haste, according to the Tories. It was in December the previous year that Mandelson had resigned over his home loan from fellow Minister Geoffrey Robinson. When Mandelson arrived, his big problem was his reputation as the Prince of Darkness, the Spin Doctor Uber Alles. How would he be able to deal with the sensitivities of a conflict that goes back generations? He seemed determined to show his mettle, and did so with two issues which he inherited: the setting up of the Assembly and the Patten report on the RUC. Mandelson got the glory for piloting through the former and is still struggling with the latter. Mandelson's contribution was devising a 'sequence', a series of statements from US peace broker George Mitchell, General Sir John de Chastelain, Sinn Fein, the UUP and the IRA, designed to ease suspicions among both Trimble's and Adams's supporters. Trimble still had to get the Mitchell deal past the 860-member Ulster Unionist Council. Mandelson jumped in with an alacrity which alarmed Trimble's aides. He expressed an evangelistic desire to sell the deal to every Unionist association in the province, and was quietly dissuaded by veteran Unionists who warned him that the UUC delegates are immune to the hard sell. Not that this advice stopped Mandelson. He delivered a scathing attack on Ian Paisley's DUP in the House of Commons, accusing it of 'blatant hypocrisy'. He unilaterally announced the award of the George Cross to the RUC, and was effusive about its history - which led Unionists to question that, if he thought the RUC were so honourable, why did he later agree with Patten and strip the police of their 'Royal' title? Naturally, there was a multi-constituency which would always be hostile, and Mandy met it in Portadown where he tried to sell the Mitchell deal with Trimble in Edenderry Orange Hall. He was sneered at and heckled by supporters of the DUP and Drumcree Orangemen in the hall, and faced a barrage of hate-filled abuse as he left. According to civil servants, Mandelson later confessed that the short run from the door of the Orange hall to his bullet-proof Daimler gave him the most terrifying seconds of his life, as police struggled to hold back the flag-waving mob baying 'traitor!' and 'queer!' Having lost Paisley and company as he started, he lost many more Unionist supporters when he delivered the coup de grace to the RUC. Nationalist Ireland was always wary of his reputation, but was really taken aback by the ruthlessness and, it is argued, mendacity with which he moved to end the Executive and save David Trimble from his own party.

Mandelson's other hobby is Bobby, a cute gold puppy, which he has taken to bringing with him on his engagements. At one conference he arrived 20 minutes early, and it was suggested that he might like to chat to some young people present. He declined, saying he would rather play with his dog. The bemused organisers gaped as Bobby was released from the back of the Daimler, and man and dog played 'fetch' in the car park.

While Zimbabwe is partially about an imperial past, Bolivia is the story of Britain's imperial future. </p> <p>First, let's correct the arithmetic. The count in Bolivia is now six dead after the military fired at demonstrators opposing the 35 per cent hike in water prices imposed on the city of Cochabamba by the new owners of the water system, International Waters Ltd of London. </p> <p>IWL, like many of Britain's multinational operators, is controlled by a larger US corporation, in this case San Francisco-based construction giant Bechtel. Best known here as builder of the London Underground Jubilee Line extension, Bechtel recently set off on a quest to own and operate water systems worldwide. United Utilities, originally co-owner of IWL is now merely 'strategic partner' in the venture. </p> <p>Following the Cochabamba killings, Hugo Banzer (once Bolivia's dictator, now elected President), declared a nationwide state of siege, abolishing civil liberties. On 12 April, just after the martial law declaration, World Bank director James Wolfensohn told reporters: 'The riots in Bolivia, I'm happy to say, are now quieting down.' </p> <p>I contacted Oscar Olivera, a trade union official and leader of the protests, to ask him how he had organised the riots. On 6 April, Olivera - with a coalition of 14 economists, parliamentarians, lawyers and community leaders - accepted a government invitation to discuss the IWL price hikes. After entering the government offices in Cochabamba, Olivera and his colleagues were arrested. </p> <p>With Olivera in chains, the riot outside the building could only have been directed by the leader of the 500 protesters, Cochabamba's Roman Catholic Archbishop. </p> <p>There is, of course, the possibility that Wolfensohn had got it wrong, and that the people he called rioters were in fact innocent victims of deadly repression. Olivera, one of five protest leaders released, flew to Washington to try to speak with Wolfensohn. But the director is a busy man and Olivera left without having a meeting. </p> <p>The price hikes that triggered the water war were driven by IWL's need to recover the cost of the huge Misicuni dam project. Water from the dam system will cost roughly six times that of alternative sources. Why would IWL want water from a ludicrously expensive source? Just possibly because IWL owns a part of the Misicuni dam project. </p> <p>The public had one other problem with IWL's charging for the dam project: there is no dam. It has not yet been built. </p> <p>It is a basic tenet of accounting that investors, not customers, fund capital projects. The risk-takers then recover their outlay, with profit, when the project produces a product for sale. This is the heart, soul and justification of the system called 'capitalism'. That's the theory. But when a monopoly operator gets its fist around a city's water spigots, it can pump the funds for capital projects from captive customers rather than shareholders. </p> <p>Samuel Sor\u00eda, the Bolivian government's former consultant on the water projects, said he was unable to extract from IWL evidence of it having put any funds at all into the operation. Water prices could, he fears, eventually rise by 150 per cent. </p> <p>Luis Bredow, publisher of the newspaper Gente told me 'no money was shelled out by anybody' for Cochabamba's water company. His own investigation concluded that the operators grabbed the entire system for nothing. He attributes these exceptionally favourable terms to IWL's partnership with former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora, leader of a political party allied to Banzer. </p> <p>IWL's London spokesman said little more than: 'How did you find out that IWL was involved in Cochabamba?' (The company's Bolivian group is called Aguas de Altuni.) In fact, the British company's involvement is getting to be ' misterioso '. President Banzer, to quell the spreading demonstrations, announced cancellation of the water privatisation on 5 April. </p> <p>But the next day, word leaked that IWL was back in the saddle at the water company and people nationwide took to the streets again. </p> <p>On 10 April, the panicked government declared that the foreign consortium had 'abandoned' its franchise when its British chief executive supposedly fled the country. But last Thursday we tracked the IWL executive to a hotel in La Paz where, his associates told me, they were about to open negotiations with the Banzer government. </p> <p>From its US headquarters, Bechtel issued a statement denying that the upheaval in Bolivia had anything to do with its water price hikes. </p> <p>It can't be said that the British-American operators brought misery to Cochabamba; they found plenty already there. Intestinal infection leading to diarrhoeal illness is Bolivia's number one child killer - the result of water hook-ups and sanitation reaching only 31 per cent of rural homes. </p> <p>World Bank director Wolfensohn has a solution to the lack of water: raise the price. So pay up, he demanded of the protesting Bolivian water users. But this contradicts the internal counsel of his own experts. In July 1997, at a meeting in Washington, the Bank's technocrats laid before the Bolivians the case against Misicuni, and even warned about social upheaval if prices rose. According to a World Bank insider, the Bank's hydrologists and technicians devised a water plan for Cochabamba at a fraction of Misicuni's bloated cost. </p> <p>So why did Wolfensohn attack protests against a project the World Bank itself found dodgy? Because there are larger plans not discussed with the Bank's low-level minions. Long before ministerial limousines clogged the US capital, the big policy decisions were settled in far-flung 'sectoral' meetings. In the case of water, nearly 1,000 executives and bureaucrats gathered in The Hague last month to review and refine a programme to privatise the world's water systems. </p> <p>But private operators can turn profits only if prices rise radically and rapidly. IWF secured from Bolivia a 16 per cent real guaranteed return. This profit boost is itself enough to account for the initial 35 per cent hike in rates. </p> <p>To assist such 'reform', the IMF, World Bank and Inter- American Development Bank have written sell-offs into what they term national 'master plans'. Consortia such as IWL were formed to capture these cast-off public assets. </p> <p>The justifiable basis for the sell-offs was that privateers committed to deliver capital for desperately needed system repairs and expansion. But the promises rapidly wilted. Cochabamba's protest organisers knew that just across the border in Buenos Aires, the region's first privatisation consortium eliminated 7,500 workers, whereupon the system bled from lack of maintenance and prices jumped. The new owners of the Buenos Aires system notably include Anglian Water. </p> <p>Britain is re-establishing imperial reach through rapid low-capital takeovers of former state assets, concentrated in infrastructure where monopoly control virtually guarantees an outsized profit. It all seemed a riskless romp - until a few thirsty, angry peasants decided they could stop it. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>I've been trying to think of a collective noun for press releases this week. A recycle? A vacuum? An Alice Band? Every morning my letterbox is full of the things. Most are unremarkable, not to say pointless - 'Add a touch of sparkle to your summer cooking with Champagne Duval-Leroy' is pretty typical - but occasionally, just occasionally, something stands out. </p> <p>Take the release I received from the importer of Blue Nun, the historic German Liebfraumilch brand, last week. Now if you were the importer of this sweet concoction, you'd probably keep quiet. But Ehrmanns has some remarkable news to impart: Blue Nun is making a comeback. So successful was it in the run-up to Christmas that it's currently the 12th biggest seller in the country. This summer sees the launch of a Blue Nun Merlot (of all things) from the south of France. Mmm, I can't wait. </p> <p>What is happening here? For those who hoped that branded wines were on a very steep slide to oblivion, the news is not good. According to the trade magazine Harpers, which held a 'brand storm' recently, branded wines account for 20 per cent of all bottles purchased in the UK, up from one in seven in 1998. In other words, the more wine we buy as a nation, the more likely we are to plump for the reassurance of a well-known name. That's why Le Piat d'Or, Black Tower, Mateus Ros\u00e9 and good old Blue Nun still sell far more bottles than they should do. </p> <p>The branded market has changed a lot. The 'classics' are still hanging on, but only Le Piat d'Or and Stowells of Chelsea are in the top 10. Mateus and the Liebs have been supplanted by New World brands: Gallo, Jacob's Creek, Lindemans, Rosemount, Penfolds, Blossom Hill and Banrock Station. I wouldn't cross an empty phone booth to drink a bottle of Blossom Hill, and I'm none too crazy about Gallo's cheaper offerings, but the picture is brighter than it used to be. Remember Veuve du Vernay? </p> <p>Branded wines are no longer regarded with scorn. Educated friends of mine are quite happy to serve, say, Lindemans' Bin 65 at a dinner party and I don't blame them. All the same, I can't help thinking branded wines are an easy option. It doesn't take much more effort to buy something interesting for the same money. </p> <p>The whole point of branding is to 'add value'. Translated from marketing speak, this means charging more for something than it's worth. Otherwise, how do you pay for all the advertising, price promotions and T-shirts? Brands play on our lack of confidence, our need to conform. They are blandness in liquid form. </p> <p>Someone at the brand storm compared branded wines to package holidays. Not everyone, he said, wants to go trekking in the Atlas Mountains; some people are happy to lie on a beach in Benidorm. To me, the analogy is amusing but false.

      "bodyText": "I've been trying to think of a collective noun for press releases this week. A recycle? A vacuum? An Alice Band? Every morning my letterbox is full of the things. Most are unremarkable, not to say pointless - 'Add a touch of sparkle to your summer cooking with Champagne Duval-Leroy' is pretty typical - but occasionally, just occasionally, something stands out. Take the release I received from the importer of Blue Nun, the historic German Liebfraumilch brand, last week. Now if you were the importer of this sweet concoction, you'd probably keep quiet. But Ehrmanns has some remarkable news to impart: Blue Nun is making a comeback. So successful was it in the run-up to Christmas that it's currently the 12th biggest seller in the country. This summer sees the launch of a Blue Nun Merlot (of all things) from the south of France. Mmm, I can't wait. What is happening here? For those who hoped that branded wines were on a very steep slide to oblivion, the news is not good. According to the trade magazine Harpers, which held a 'brand storm' recently, branded wines account for 20 per cent of all bottles purchased in the UK, up from one in seven in 1998. In other words, the more wine we buy as a nation, the more likely we are to plump for the reassurance of a well-known name. That's why Le Piat d'Or, Black Tower, Mateus Ros\u00e9 and good old Blue Nun still sell far more bottles than they should do. The branded market has changed a lot. The 'classics' are still hanging on, but only Le Piat d'Or and Stowells of Chelsea are in the top 10. Mateus and the Liebs have been supplanted by New World brands: Gallo, Jacob's Creek, Lindemans, Rosemount, Penfolds, Blossom Hill and Banrock Station. I wouldn't cross an empty phone booth to drink a bottle of Blossom Hill, and I'm none too crazy about Gallo's cheaper offerings, but the picture is brighter than it used to be. Remember Veuve du Vernay? Branded wines are no longer regarded with scorn. Educated friends of mine are quite happy to serve, say, Lindemans' Bin 65 at a dinner party and I don't blame them. All the same, I can't help thinking branded wines are an easy option. It doesn't take much more effort to buy something interesting for the same money. The whole point of branding is to 'add value'. Translated from marketing speak, this means charging more for something than it's worth. Otherwise, how do you pay for all the advertising, price promotions and T-shirts? Brands play on our lack of confidence, our need to conform. They are blandness in liquid form. Someone at the brand storm compared branded wines to package holidays. Not everyone, he said, wants to go trekking in the Atlas Mountains; some people are happy to lie on a beach in Benidorm. To me, the analogy is amusing but false. Package holidays sell because they offer sunshine at cheap prices. Branded wines offer sunshine, too, but all too often the prices are a rip off. Personally, I'd also like to see a few more wine lovers heading for the vinous equivalent of the Atlas Mountains. However, two branded wines I would recommend are the 1998 Caliterra Cabernet Sauvignon, Valle Central (\u00a35.49, Wine Rack) and the 1999 Rosemount Shiraz/Cabernet (\u00a36.45, Asda).",

      "body": "<p>Twenty minutes walk south from Marrakech's Place Djemaa el Fna, past the derelict swimming pool, its walls festooned with roses and where, incidentally, I was once robbed at knife-point, you come to an old olive grove. A secret place. I hope it remains - there was much peace and shade there, and none of the interminable hassling of the hashish boys. It was here, several years ago, that I spent every afternoon for three weeks, hiding from Morocco's searing heat, sprawled out under the olives, shelling bag after bag of pistachios. This is not a nut to open with nutcrackers and to munch by the handful, but a nut that seems designed for lazy days, held in a tight shell that you can open only with your fingernails. </p> <p>A couple of Saturdays ago, the first day warm enough to sit in the garden, I perched on the back steps with a beer and a bag of salty, white-shelled pistachios - fat Iranian ones they were, and the juiciest I have ever had. These little nuts seem to go hand in hand with the sun, with long cold drinks, ashtrays piled up with their hard oval shells. They fray your nails, of course, but teasing the rose-skinned nuts from their cases is part of the fun. Anyone who has ever bought a bag of ready-shelled pistachios will know how much of this nut's magic seems lost. </p> <p>The pistachios I knew as a child were not pistachios at all but dyed almonds, chopped as fine as tea leaves and sprinkled on the trifles that came in little waxed cartons that we brought back from the bakers on a Saturday. It wasn't until I went to Greece on a package holiday that I met a real one in its shell, and since then I have associated them with the sun. Unlike our indigenous nuts, the hazel and the cob, the pistachio needs hot, dry conditions and poor soil in which to grow. </p> <p>I welcome not having to find the nutcrackers, for once. The little nuts are always open, waiting patiently for someone to slide in a thumb and prise the shells apart. They get this way not because of some cottage industry that partly cracks each nut for us before exporting them (this guy actually believed that for years), but as a result of being left in the shade to dry, when their pinky skin flakes off and the shell cracks open. A little miracle. Those who have ever tried to open a tightly shut pistachio with a pair of nutcrackers - and who must surely have been desperately at the end of their bag but not the end of their beer - will know that it doesn't really work. The nut crumbles. </p> <p>Although I toss them from time to time into rice pilaf or use them to decorate a proper trifle, pistachios are really associated with the pastries of the Middle East. The Turkish shops around Newington Green in north-east London sell filo pastries filled with the pulverised nuts and smothered in honey syrup. They cut them from battered tin trays, and you eat them with sticky fingers from a paper plate. </p> <p>They occasionally turn up in French charcuterie, but the pistachio is more at home in little pastries and dipped into impossibly sweet syrups flavoured with rose-water and orange blossom. It is here they are at their most elegant, and to be eaten, surely, with a glass of mint tea or a tiny, shockingly strong and murky coffee. In Paris, I sometimes spend a lazy afternoon at the hammam in the mosque behind the Jardin des Plantes and slip into its tea rooms. Freshly scrubbed and minus a layer of skin, I make up for it with mint tea and sweet pastries. </p> <p>A pistachio is the most beautiful of nuts, its beige skin blushed with purple, the bright-green flesh peeping through. If you eat the nut straight from its shell, then the skin is perfectly edible, but if the nuts are to end up in cakes, pastries or ice cream, then I think it worth peeling them. The bits of skin can get stuck in your teeth. </p> <p>This doesn't really apply to the nuts that are eaten as part of the pistachio ritual. And it is a ritual: the cold beer being poured, the shells being tweaked open, the little nut teased out, then the shells discarded in a shambolic heap. Am I the only person who sometimes licks the salt from the empty shells? </p> <p>As with any nut, you need to buy them from somewhere with a fast turnover. Look out for pistachios that are cleanly packed. Old, dusty bags with much loose skin in the bottom are bound to be dry and possibly rancid. This is not a nut for keeping. I regularly visit a shop in west London that has piles of them, loose and in bags, in every possible state from white-shelled and unsalted to those that have been ready-peeled and chopped. </p> <p>In India, I have come across pistachio brittle flavoured with cardamom, the little nuts embedded in crisp caramel and flecked with saffron. I bring as much back as I can carry. Pistachio ice cream is worth trying, too, though it is exceedingly difficult to find. The Italians and the Lebanese make it, and you sometimes see it in Middle Eastern shops. It is delicious with chocolate of any sort. Rowley Leigh of Kensington Place Restaurant in London's Notting Hill sometimes adds a spoonful to his hot chocolate souffl\u00e9. But first find your pistachio ice cream - or for that matter your shady olive grove. </p> <p><strong> Pistachio yogurt cheesecake</strong><br> A nutty, sharp-tasting, soft-textured cheesecake, far away from what I call 'claggy' cheesecake, and substantially less sweet. It is more of a dessert than a cake, really. There is a little sweetness from the sugar and dried fruit, but this is a clean-tasting cheesecake, barely firm enough to cut, though it will stiffen up if left in the fridge overnight. </p> <p>Serves 8. </p> <p><strong> for the biscuit base</strong> <br>10 digestive biscuits <br>50g butter </p> <p><strong> for the cheesecake</strong> </p> <p>75g butter <br>75g caster sugar <br>500g mascarpone <br>2 egg yolks <br>6 heaped tbsps thick yogurt <br>a drop of vanilla extract <br>3 tsps rose-water <br>60g pistachio nuts (shelled weight) <br>30g dried cherries or sultanas <br>50g ready-to-eat dried apricots, finely chopped </p> <p>Crush the biscuits so they resemble coarse breadcrumbs. Melt the butter in a small pan and stir in the biscuit crumbs. Tip them into a 23cm diameter cake tin and press them down, then refrigerate while you make the filling. </p> <p>Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, then beat in the mascarpone, eggs and yogurt. Stir in a little vanilla extract and the rose-water. Whiz the pistachio nuts briefly in a food processor so they are as fine as fresh breadcrumbs, but not as fine as ground almonds. </p> <p>Fold the ground pistachios into the mascarpone mixture with the dried cherries and apricots, then tip on top of the biscuit crumbs and refrigerate for 3 or 4 hours. It will not set as such, but should be soft and creamy. </p> <p><strong> Pistachio pastries</strong><br> Little pastries to eat with mint tea or coffee - a sweet treat indeed. For how to skin the nuts, see below. Makes 8 small pastries. </p> <p>175g pistachio nuts (shelled weight) <br>1 egg, beaten <br>grated zest of a lemon <br>orange-blossom water <br>rose-water <br>5 tbsps plain flour <br>2 sheets of filo pastry <br>melted butter </p> <p><strong> for the syrup</strong> <br>150g caster sugar <br>100ml water <br>2 tbsps honey <br>2 tsps each orange-blossom water and rose-water </p> <p>Blitz the nuts to a coarse powder in a food processor, tip them into a mixing bowl, then mix them with the beaten egg, sugar, grated lemon zest and 1 tsp or so of rose-water and orange-blossom water. Stir in the flour. The consistency should be that of a stiffish cake mixture. </p> <p>Open out the sheets of filo pastry - one at a time so they do not dry up - and cut each piece into four long strips. Brush each piece generously with melted butter, then turn them so the short edge is facing you. Put a generously heaped tablespoon of the mixture at the bottom of each strip. Fold the right-hand bottom corner over to cover the filling, pressing the edges down around it to form a triangle, then continue rolling the parcel over until the filling is completely enclosed. Brush with butter to seal. </p> <p>Continue with the other strips. You should end up with eight triangular parcels. Place them on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes at 200\u00b0C/gas mark 6 until they are golden and crisp. </p> <p>While they are baking, melt the sugar and water together over a moderate heat and add the honey and orange-flower water and set it aside. When the little pastries come out of the oven, brush them very generously with the honey syrup. Set them aside to cool slightly. They are best eaten warm. </p> <p> <strong> To skin the pistachios </strong><br> You really do need to skin pistachios for some recipes such as those above, so here are two ways to do this. You should soak the shelled nuts in warm water, then rub off the skins with your fingers, discarding the purple skins. Before they are ground, the nuts should be allowed to dry, otherwise they will simply clog the grinder. I tend to take a slightly less perfectionist view and rub the dry, freshly shelled nuts roughly together in my hands so they rub off each other's skins. It is no quite as successful as the soaking and drying method, but it works well enough.</p>",

      "body": "<p>You are not meant to walk to Canary Wharf. It's not what it was built for. You are meant to get there by car or by Docklands Light Railway or, since late last year, by the Jubilee Line extension. It fizzes along beneath the clutter and decay of London's East End to deliver you, calm and unflustered, to this Gotham City of glass and steel and marble and money. This kind of money demands a more graceful approach. To get to this kind of money you should glide. </p> <p>Stand on the pedestrian overpass at Poplar's DLR station and you could be forgiven for thinking that it is literally impossible to reach Canary Wharf on foot. Every potential route appears to disappear amid a tight knot of concrete shadows. Whoever wins the first election for Mayor of London in 10 days time might like to come and have a look for themselves. Nowhere in the city will they get a better sense of the challenges that face them. For here they will be standing on an urban fault line; the gap between rich and poor made asphalt and concrete; a chasm that might as well be a mile deep as a mere quarter of a mile wide. From here you can see both the best and worst of places. </p> <p>Behind, to the north, is the low-rise smudge of Tower Hamlets, one of London's poorest boroughs. Canary Wharf is also part of Tower Hamlets but, in truth, all they share is the name. In areas of Bow and Mile End, Stepney and Poplar, unemployment is four times or more the London average. It has some of Britain's highest rates of mental illness, heart disease, alcohol and drug dependency. There, in the impoverished Bengali communities, tuberculosis is no longer a vanquished foe. It is a real killer, coaxed from its deep-tissue hiding place by damp and overcrowded housing. </p> <p>Turn to look south again and the view changes dramatically. First you see the Tarmac scar of Aspen Way, widened to accommodate the glossy cars that now come out this far east. Beyond that is a broad stretch of undeveloped ground currently used as a car park and further still, the dark, oily waters of what used to be the old docks before they were closed down in 1980 when cargo shipping deserted these lower reaches of the Thames. Finally, the northern flank of the Canary Wharf development rises vertiginously skywards, like some gilded cliff. However impressive the view, no footpath immediately presents itself. It's as if the whole multi-billion-pound edifice was designed to keep the locals out. </p> <p>As it happens, there is a way to get there on foot, tucked away beneath the DLR line that runs overhead. Behind it a narrow footbridge leads from the quayside to land you right in the heart of the Canary Wharf estate. Go across to the neatly manicured Cabot Square, turn left and down through the underground shopping malls, bulging with Mont Blanc shops and Starbucks coffee bars and places selling expensive chrome stuff to boys in suits. Eventually you will come to the base of 1 Canada Square, at 800ft the tallest building in London. Take the express lift to the 30th floor and there, in the marketing suite of the Canary Wharf Group plc, which owns the entire estate, you will find a three-dimensional illustration of the gross schism that defines this part of London. </p> <p>They have built a relief model of the capital, over 20ft long and 10ft wide, the individual buildings across the city picked out in little blocks a few centimetres square. At its heart, proudly tumescent beneath an overhead spotlight, stands the Canary Wharf development. The rest of Tower Hamlets is cast in its shadow. John Pagano, the youthful vice-president for construction, stands beside his pride and joy pressing buttons. 'Here comes the DLR,' he says, and a river of yellow lights marking the route streams in across the map towards where we are standing. 'And here's the Jubilee Line. And now the road system. And of course City Airport.' The map pulses with pretty coloured lights, all pouring towards us, as if the critical mass of Canary Wharf were a black hole sucking in everything around it. </p> <p>Pagano leads me through to the next room. It houses a fabulous model village in Perspex and balsawood showing every building on the 85-acre estate, and those still to come. 'Here we have a residential scheme of 310 apartments going up,' he says, pointing to the western end. 'There will be a health club and, of course, the Four Seasons Hotel is already there. 'Over here' he moves further along, 'is a complex of three different buildings. In here Texaco, in here Reader's Digest and' </p> <p>He continues, evangelising for floor space: at one end, the new HSBC world headquarters now being built; nearby a skyscraper that will house Citigroup and Solomon Smith Barney. There are landscaped parks, atriums for winter gardens providing a 'pleasant temperate environment', and shops and more health clubs and more shops and more apartments. This is large-scale construction. </p> <p>The statistics are extraordinary. Already there is 5.8 million sq ft of office space here and a further 3.2 million is under construction. When the project is completed there will be 11 million sq ft in all. From a working population of 8,000 people in 1994 it now houses 27,000. Eventually 100,000 people are expected to work here on banking floors and in newspapers and oil companies. More money flushes through these buildings every day than some nation states see in a year. The Canary Wharf Group plc is valued at between \u00a32.6 and \u00a32.9 billion, though the overall cost of the development, including transport infrastructure, is billions more. </p> <p>How can any of this chrome and marble excess, this intense Manhattan-on-Thames, ever mean anything to the less enriched residents of Tower Hamlets either side? It is not a question for Pagano. He is simply a real estate salesmen, albeit one overseeing one of the greatest slabs of real estate in the world. It is a question for Robert John, a softly spoken Welshman who is a director of the company, but who has no job title. He has an office with a broad view of the Isle of Dogs to the south and hung with fine abstract art. John was one of the first people to be hired by Canadian developer Paul Reichman whose company, Olympia &amp; York, began the work at Canary Wharf before it went bust during the recession of the early 90s. (Reichman subsequently bought the company back from the administrators and renamed it the Canary Wharf Group.) </p> <p>'Paul Reichman said to me right at the beginning that we must always remember that we are new members of an old community,' John says. The key, he explains, is getting local people to work here, so the company has invested cash in skills-match programmes and sent ambassadors out into local schools. 'Yes, we need investment bankers, but we also need chefs,' he says. 'Yes, we need tax inspectors, but we also need taxi drivers. What we need to do is get this message out there.' </p> <p>And, he says proudly, it's working. They have a survey that shows an increase in the number of workers at Canary Wharf who live in Tower Hamlets from 4.5 per cent in 1997 to 8.4 per cent in 1999. 'Clearly we're getting two things,' John says. 'We're getting old locals finding jobs here and we're getting people with jobs here who are moving into the area to become new locals.' There has, after all, been a massive boom in expensive wharf-apartment developments. The problem is that, at the moment, John doesn't know how many of the 8.4 per cent are the old locals he wants. Still, he says, they are trying. They care. They give a damn. </p> <p>It would be easy to be cynical about this professed commitment to the local community by both Robert John and the Canary Wharf Group. Capital doesn't care about the little people, does it? Capital cares about profit and margins. Capital exists to serve the demands of the Great God Mammon, and if it does not, it has no purpose at all. </p> <p>Perhaps, but to dismiss their efforts altogether would be unfair, according to John Eversely, a lecturer in social policy at London University's Queen Mary and Westfield College on the nearby Mile End Road. 'As socially aware developers go, they are right up there with the Cadburys and the Rowntrees,' he says. 'They really do mean it. But the amount they put in is still chicken-feed compared to the size of the problem.' So is the gap between these two Londons, existing here side by side, at all bridgeable? 'If it is bridgeable,' Eversley concludes, 'it's only by the longest bridge in the history of the world.' </p> <p>The Alpha Grove Community Centre should, by rights, be the richest community centre in Britain. It sits on the edge of the Barkantine council estate on the Isle of Dogs just a few hundred yards south of Canary Wharf. From here, you can practically smell the money, hear it clanking through the tills. In theory, some of that cash should have found its way to the centre. </p> <p>It hasn't. The roof leaks. The heating system has broken down and there isn't the cash to fix it. The mini-bus, used to pick up kids after school when their parents are still working, is grinding to a halt. 'Funders love to fund individual projects,' says Anna Palm, a former music teacher who now runs the centre. 'But they won't come up with core funding. My salary is only sorted for the next two months. After that, who knows?' </p> <p>It's not supposed to be this way. When development of the Docklands area began in the early 80s, the Conservative government set up the London Docklands Development Corporation. It spent \u00a33.9 billion of public money regenerating the area to match the \u00a39 billion spent by the private sector, before it was wound up in 1998. Some of that cash did find its way to the Barkantine. The dilapidated tower blocks received new facades and walkways were given a makeover. </p> <p>'The result was more graffiti and vandalism,' says Anna Palm, 'because you can't paint over a basic grass-roots problem. There are serious issues of poverty on this estate and the kids just see this huge development to all sides and think \"there's nothing here for me\".' The LDDC was replaced by the Isle of Dogs Community Foundation which has received seven-figure grants of government regeneration money, but that doesn't seem to be finding its way to Alpha Grove either. Palm picks up a map and points out the site of a new business and residential development, the Millennium Quarter, which will bear down on them from the north. 'We're going to be squished in between it and the river,' she says. All around them are \u00a3250,000 apartments. </p> <p>The Canary Wharf Group donates two hours of a business manager's time to come down and help the centre apply for grants, for which she says she is grateful. But it clearly frustrates her that there is so much wealth so close by and yet they can't get the relatively small amounts they need to secure the vital services for the elderly or after-school kids' clubs that the community relies upon. Sometimes that frustration breaks through. Recently some of the children from the centre put on a show in Cabot Hall at Canary Wharf. 'Everybody from the companies up there said how great it was so I tried to follow it up, tried to get donations from them but nothing happened. These cute little kids from the Isle of Dogs dancing around free for the businessmen at Canary Wharf and what do we get for it? Sod all.' </p> <p>Karen Earp has not heard of the Barkantine Estate. She can be forgiven. She has been very busy launching the new Four Seasons Hotel at Canary Wharf, where she is general manager. She also lives here, in an apartment just around the corner. She readily enthuses about what Wharf living means to her: 'I love it. I love the vibrancy of Canary Wharf during the day contrasted with the calming views of the river. Everything is out here and there isn't the traffic. It's just so compact. You haven't got the razzmatazz of the West End, of course, but you can go and get it. And now on weekends all the bars and restaurants are open so it doesn't die. It's a little oasis. You've got everything you need.' </p> <p>She, like Robert John, talks about a desire to employ local people, which she says she has done, in house-keeping, maintenance and in the kitchens. She also proclaims a love for the old East End pubs with their old East End 'characters', although she says she doesn't really go south on the Isle of Dogs much, which perhaps also explains why she has never come across the Barkantine. </p> <p>She takes me up to the presidential suite, a confection of blonde wood floors and sofas upholstered in shades of chocolate and caramel (brown, the new black). She shows me the Bang &amp; Olufsen system and the marble clad bathroom and the pantry and the dining room. The suite costs \u00a31,400 a night. Finally she shows me the view. It looks westwards down the curving river, towards Tower Bridge and the London Eye millennium wheel beyond. By one of those clever twists of geography you can see neither the impoverished districts to the north, nor to the south from here. But then, if you're paying \u00a31,400 a night, you'll expect a good view. </p> <p>The Ocean Estate. It's a nice name, isn't it? Oceans teem with life. They swell and flow with the tides. They wash us clean. </p> <p>The Ocean Estate isn't a particularly nice place and it isn't clean. It is just a mile and a half to the north-east of Canary Wharf in Stepney, but it is an area that the billions of LDDC money was never designed to reach. Recently, John Eversley's research team from Queen Mary and Westfield College conducted research for Tower Hamlets Council as part of an ongoing bid for \u00a350 million of Government regeneration money. The findings were startling: 51 per cent of households live on under \u00a310,000 a year; only 25 per cent of adults are in full time paid work; 84 per cent of households are on some kind of state benefit; 36 per cent suffer from health problems; 44 per cent of households contain someone suffering from a long term illness or disability. </p> <p>I visit in the company of Jasmin, a 19-year-old Bangladeshi student who has agreed to translate. The vast majority of the residents are immigrants from Bangladesh who arrived here in the 70s and, for much of the older generation, Bengali remains their first language. </p> <p>The Ocean is a depressing place to end up. Most of it is glowering, 30s, red-brick blocks, now turned a dirty brown by years of decay. Some of the buildings have had makeovers, been fitted with entry phones to increase security or double glazing. But others appear not to have been touched for decades. In places, water from broken gutters streams down the sides of buildings, leaving stains of green algae. Rubbish and old mattresses pile up in and around stairwells. Some of the flats are disused, their windows and doors shuttered off with slabs of steel. </p> <p>Mohammed Ismael, a 66-year-old Bangladeshi, has lived here since 1983. He shows us into one of the bedrooms of his ground floor flat in Ionian House. Black mould is climbing the walls and ceiling and below, at floor level, paper is beginning to peel off from the damp. We move on to the bathroom which looks like something from a different era, something that ought to be photographed in sepia. The same damp and mould is everywhere and the paint is peeling and flaking away. 'There are people who come from the council. They use a machine to test it but they say there's nothing wrong,' he explains to Jasmin. Ismael is recovering from a heart bypass operation so he can't redecorate. 'And in any case,' he says, 'what's the point? The paper would only peel away with the damp.' </p> <p>The same story is repeated in flats across the estate. One woman complains about the green mould that she keeps having to scrape off the window frames. Another talks about the kids who hang around in the stairwells taking drugs. Heroin smoking is rife among the 18 to 25 -year-olds here. Only recently has the Bengali community begun to face up to the severity of the problem. They are finally making contact with local addiction charities. That will start to solve the problem, but everybody here knows what is really required. People need jobs. They need better housing. They need opportunities. They need prospects. </p> <p>More than anything they need a way out. </p> <p>We are modern. We do not despise Canary Wharf for being a place awash with wealth. We see it as a wealth producer. We do not begrudge Karen Earp her shiny lifestyle, even while there are others nearby who do not have what she has. That reductive approach is from another era when thinking on the left was based on the assumption that big business was only a force for bad and had to be brought to heel by regulation or taxation. But it still offends that such extremes can exist in such close proximity. </p> <p>So we want Canary Wharf and we want Karen Earp. But we also want the damp in Mohammed Ismael's flat dealt with, and the hole in the roof of the Alpha Grove Community Centre fixed. This is the real challenge that will face whoever is elected mayor of London on May 4. We will expect them to close up the gaps - all of them.</p>",

The Ocean is a depressing place to end up. Most of it is glowering, 30s, red-brick blocks, now turned a dirty brown by years of decay. Some of the buildings have had makeovers, been fitted with entry phones to increase security or double glazing. But others appear not to have been touched for decades. In places, water from broken gutters streams down the sides of buildings, leaving stains of green algae. Rubbish and old mattresses pile up in and around stairwells. Some of the flats are disused, their windows and doors shuttered off with slabs of steel. Mohammed Ismael, a 66-year-old Bangladeshi, has lived here since 1983. He shows us into one of the bedrooms of his ground floor flat in Ionian House. Black mould is climbing the walls and ceiling and below, at floor level, paper is beginning to peel off from the damp. We move on to the bathroom which looks like something from a different era, something that ought to be photographed in sepia. The same damp and mould is everywhere and the paint is peeling and flaking away. 'There are people who come from the council. They use a machine to test it but they say there's nothing wrong,' he explains to Jasmin. Ismael is recovering from a heart bypass operation so he can't redecorate. 'And in any case,' he says, 'what's the point? The paper would only peel away with the damp.' The same story is repeated in flats across the estate. One woman complains about the green mould that she keeps having to scrape off the window frames. Another talks about the kids who hang around in the stairwells taking drugs. Heroin smoking is rife among the 18 to 25 -year-olds here. Only recently has the Bengali community begun to face up to the severity of the problem. They are finally making contact with local addiction charities. That will start to solve the problem, but everybody here knows what is really required. People need jobs. They need better housing. They need opportunities. They need prospects. More than anything they need a way out. We are modern. We do not despise Canary Wharf for being a place awash with wealth. We see it as a wealth producer. We do not begrudge Karen Earp her shiny lifestyle, even while there are others nearby who do not have what she has. That reductive approach is from another era when thinking on the left was based on the assumption that big business was only a force for bad and had to be brought to heel by regulation or taxation. But it still offends that such extremes can exist in such close proximity. So we want Canary Wharf and we want Karen Earp. But we also want the damp in Mohammed Ismael's flat dealt with, and the hole in the roof of the Alpha Grove Community Centre fixed. This is the real challenge that will face whoever is elected mayor of London on May 4. We will expect them to close up the gaps - all of them.",

      "body": "<p> Is it worth planting trees for their blossom, when the flowers only last for a few days, often bear no fruit, and in many cases do not make particularly attractive trees? Blossom works on us in a way that few other flowers do. It is partly promise (that froth of flower is as life-confirming as anything your eyes will set on for another year), partly surprise (trees in flower are scarce in this country and it continues to amaze us that it happens at all), partly sheer beauty (I still find the combination of May blossom and cow parsley on a lovely spring day the most achingly beautiful thing in the world), and partly the hint towards fecundity, because all blossom is merely a precursor to possible fruit. </p> <p>So many different messages riding on little white or pink flowers! But all arriving at the same place - that heart-lurch when you come across the first blossom of the year in the sunshine - what Dennis Potter, dying in front of our eyes and swigging morphine from a hip flask, called 'the blossomest blossom'. What was really remarkable about that remark was not just the blithe courage or the glimpse of the daily world made infinitely precious in the jaws of death, but that each of us experiences this intensity daily for perhaps a week a year courtesy of blossom. </p> <p>As one who has never studied even the most rudimentary botany (at this point certain members of the horticultural world splutter apoplectically on their coffee, but a slap - on the back - should sort them out), very elementary botanical facts provide the kind of insight that a nine-year-old has already got the T-shirt of. Here goes: all roses are mere blossom and all blossom are roses, sap-brothers under the bark. The rosaceae family includes all our blossoming trees. It explains a lot. If you see a cross section of an apple, plum and dog-rose flower, they all look remarkably similar, with the fruit waiting to swell just behind the petals. For years, the fat apples or swollen-hipped pears that appear from these flowers seemed to me to have an element of transmutation about them, rather than just being stages along the same journey. The flowers are the fruit becoming. </p> <p>In this part of the world, the becoming happens as a procession, moving slowly through the countryside like the gorgeous retinue of a benign emperor. First is the blackthorn, Prunus spinosa, more often playing a minor role in a roadside or field hedge than planted in a garden, although it is a plum of sorts and the tiny white flowers convert into sloes that wither the inside of your mouth with their astringency, although they make sloe gin, which is the best winter-warming drink there is. My grandmother used to murmur forebodingly, 'Blackthorn winter' when it flowered, and it does often seem to coincide with a sharp spell of icy weather. It has the wickedest thorns to be found in this country and, if trimmed, makes an impenetrable hedge. </p> <p>Just after the blackthorn, comes the damson blossom, also pure white, sitting on scruffy little trees dotted along the hedgerows between the cathedral cities of Hereford and Worcester like crenellations. The other day I was driving by and I thought it had begun to hail, before realising that in fact it was thousands of damson flowers swept off the branches by the wind. </p> <p>As a plant, the damson is not worth its place in any garden, but as a flower and fruit, no sane gardener should be without it. So the answer is to put it in a hedge or orchard, to scramble honeysuckle, clematis and perhaps a small rose up it, and to relish the blossom for a week or so at the end of March and the fruit in September. The plums follow just after the damson, overlapping by a few days, the baton passing from hedgerow to orchard, just as the fruit is changed from strong and small to full and sweet by the process of breeding and hybridisation. Plum blossom sits on the trees thinly, measured as much by the sky between the flowers as the massing of the blooms themselves. Check this in 11 months' time. </p> <p>Not long after the plum is the wild cherry, the gean, Prunus avium. This is often found in numbers at the edge of a wood, creating a wall of blossom set against the leafless branches of the trees behind it. They make large trees (up to 70ft) so are not suitable for a small garden, but they are incredibly decorative at every stage of the year. The bark is almost as good as the Tibetan cherry, and I remember a friend's father making his pipes from wild cherry wood, polishing the bark to a patent-leather shine on the side of his nose. Prunus avium 'Plena' is much heavier with flower and probably the one to plant in your garden. It also flowers a month later than the fully wild version, along with the sweet cherries. Ornamental cherries are the most popular of all flowering trees, on account of their range of blossom, from the almond-like Prunus x subhirtella to the hanging white flowerbells of 'Taihaku', but for me they do not fit the emotional bill of blossom because they are not producing any edible fruit. For the same reason, I would not include hawthorn in this list despite the power it has to jumble up my heart like an emotional spin-dryer. But the sweet cherries get a look-in, flowering like candyfloss (and almost as overpoweringly saccharine to the eye) at the end of this month. Then the flowers drop and blow around like brown litter for days. </p> <p>Morello cherries (Prunus cerasus), crab apples (Malus pumila), quinces (Cydonia vulgaris) and pears (Pyrus communis) all come into flower at around the same time, according to variety. Certainly they always precede the earliest apple blossom. Quince blossom is one of my favourites, having flowers with a delicacy and sublime fragrance. Quinces had a bad time of it last year, suffering from a fungal disease that browned and withered their leaves, but mine seem to have recovered. I have four varieties, all planted near each other, and 'Lescovaz' proved to be entirely resistant to this fungus. </p> <p>Crab apples are also wonderful in a much more cheeky-chappy kind of way. I don't know quite how they create that effect, as they have perfect pink and white flowers that can fill the air with their scent, but compared to the bone-china refinement of quince, or the purity of pear blossom, that is the result for me. </p> <p>Pear is my favourite blossom, either in a great tree with the blossom piled up, cumulus-like, or stretched out along espaliers. The main problem with these early blossoms, as with peaches and apricots, is that they are prone to damage by late frosts. The answer is to plant them either against a west-facing wall or shaded from the early morning sun, as it is not the frost that does the damage but the bright morning sunshine which causes rapid thawing of the frozen cells. </p> <p>The first apples, like 'Gravenstein', which has magnolia-pink flowers, start in mid-April, and the last, like the very old variety 'Court Pendu Plat', finishes a month later. This is an indication of their harvesting time, although unfortunately the fruit do not ripen exactly in the same sequential order that they flower. Thus in Roseanne Saunders's wonderful book The English Apple (sadly out of print), the earliest apple to ripen is Emneth Early, which is group 3, and the last is Granny Smith, which is in the same group. The real difference between pear and apple blossom, other than the pure whiteness of pear and strawberries-and-cream pink of most apples, is that apple blossom is borne as the leaves start to emerge, whereas pear adorns naked branches. This gives apple a fullness and softness that epitomises the fecundity of blossom-time. </p> <p>By the time the last apple blossom is coming out, the grass is growing strongly, the buttercups are out and the swallows are turning around in the sky. Go and find an orchard of old standard apple trees some time in the coming week, and lose yourself beneath the branches. You will then know that we have arrived at the best of times at last. There is no going back. And that, above all else, is why you plant blossom in the garden. </p> <p> <strong> Thompson &amp; Morgan special offer</strong> </p> <p>Observer readers can order two dwarf cherry trees, the pink Prunus 'Glandulosa Rosea' and white Prunus 'Glandulosa Alba Plena', for \u00a317.99, including UK p&amp;p.

Was it fair for Bellow, the Nobel-prizewinning novelist, to reveal so much about his dead friend's private life? And, if so, should he have disguised a personal memoir by changing Bloom's name to Ravelstein? </p> <p>Bloom was reported to have died of liver cancer aged 62, in 1992, but Ravelstein is about a brilliant man who, though a moral, academic and cultural conservative, is a closet homosexual who contracted Aids. </p> <p>For some time both these men of letters have had such status that even their political opponents have grudgingly admired them. And yet suddenly, one has betrayed the other. What is more, this week Bellow has started to admit it. </p> <p>Perhaps, he has conceded, he should not have allowed his Ravelstein to die because he had Aids when he does not know for sure. Perhaps, too, he should not have given such intimate details of Ravelstein's homosexuality since Bloom had not declared his own sexuality. </p> <p>Bloom, admired by both Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, was famous because of his book - a jere miad - called The Closing of the American Mind . It came out in 1987 and was a passionate, enraged defence of classical culture and virtue against what Bloom believed to be the ravages of mediocrity and iconoclasm in the 1960s. It hit America like a cold shower that froze the heat of the Woodstock generation. </p> <p>Bloom's great friend at the end of his life was Bellow -one of the most acclaimed novelists of our time and a guardian at the gates of the American-English lexicon. Bellow is now the 84-year-old proud father of a baby daughter by his fifth wife, but self-doubt, a hallmark of his fictional characters, appears to have taken hold. </p> <p>This week he has spoken of regret and there are reports that he is re-editing the book before its next print run to remove allusions to, among other things, Ravelstein's homosexual fantasies. </p> <p>In an interview in the New York Times, the Nobel laureate admits he underestimated the sensitivity over homosexuality and Aids. 'You know,' he says, 'I've discovered this is a very itchy subject and people carry over attitudes more appropriate to the Middle Ages.' Bellow says he is sorry he 'exposed' Bloom. 'I don't like the feeling it brought with it... and the sense of recklessness on my part.' </p> <p>Whatever Bellow's motives and affections, his literary indiscretion joins those of, among others, John Le Carr\u00e9 whose A Na\u00efve and Sentimental Lover reveals the love triangle between Le Carr\u00e9 and James and Susan Kennaway, and Paul Theroux's Sir Vidia's Shadow, on V.S. Naipaul. Bellow has approached the territory before in his Pulitzer Prize-winning Humbolt's Gift, said to be a life of of his one-time mentor Delmore Schwartz. Americans call it 'betrayal chic'. </p> <p>George Walden, the maverick former Tory Education Minister, knew both Bloom and Bellow and introduced them to Thatcher in the late 1980s. 'I don't believe that Bellow has diminished Bloom in this portrayal,' he told The Observer. 'It is not a hagiography, though. It is the kind of true picture that Bellow is so good at, although perhaps with some of the sparkling humour missing.' </p> <p>When The Closing of the American Mind was published, Walden took Bloom to Chequers to meet Thatcher. 'It was amazing. She had stayed up until 2.30am, according to Denis, reading the book. For once she was listening and asking questions.' </p> <p>In real life, it was Bellow who first urged Bloom to put his ideas into words. He also wrote the foreword. The first line is not very affectionate: 'Professor Bloom,' he writes 'has his own way of doing things.' 'I am surprised people are treating this book as a novel when it is so clearly a memoir,' said Walden. 'So many details, down to Bloom's apartment in Chicago, are exactly described. I suppose it gives Bellow a little more leeway to make it a novel. But it is also harder for others to dispute it that way.' </p> <p>Bellow's 'outing' of Bloom has appalled even some of his own circle. A close acquaintance, Werner Dannhauser, does not mind his own characterisation in the book as a womaniser called Morris, but is unforgiving of the treatment of the central theme: 'I don't believe,' he says, 'that everything is justified for art.' </p> <p>Bloom's medical executor was Nathan Tarcov, a sage at Chicago University and son of Bellow's friend Oscar Tarcov. 'The word Aids was never mentioned when Allan died,' he insists. </p> <p>This week has seen Bellow on the defensive before the book is even published. 'I'm sorry to see you getting me on to this particular track,' he told one interviewer from Time magazine, 'because I don't want to be on it.' </p> <p>But for Walden at least, Bellow's offence is not so great. 'Bloom would not have expected anything less from Bellow,' he said. In his own book, Lucky George , he wrote: 'Between them Bloom and Bellow seem to have had a knack of exposing the underside of things.' He recounts lunching with Bloom when a jewelled cigar casket spontaneously disintegrated on contact with Bloom's hand. </p> <p>If Bellow justifies his picture of Bloom the promiscuous high-liver on the grounds of truth, perhaps he should be on guard. His close friend Martin Amis is about to bring out a memoir called Experience which will detail their friendship in full.</p>",

Whatever Bellow's motives and affections, his literary indiscretion joins those of, among others, John Le Carr\u00e9 whose A Na\u00efve and Sentimental Lover reveals the love triangle between Le Carr\u00e9 and James and Susan Kennaway, and Paul Theroux's Sir Vidia's Shadow, on V.S. Naipaul. Bellow has approached the territory before in his Pulitzer Prize-winning Humbolt's Gift, said to be a life of of his one-time mentor Delmore Schwartz. Americans call it 'betrayal chic'. George Walden, the maverick former Tory Education Minister, knew both Bloom and Bellow and introduced them to Thatcher in the late 1980s. 'I don't believe that Bellow has diminished Bloom in this portrayal,' he told The Observer. 'It is not a hagiography, though. It is the kind of true picture that Bellow is so good at, although perhaps with some of the sparkling humour missing.' When The Closing of the American Mind was published, Walden took Bloom to Chequers to meet Thatcher. 'It was amazing. She had stayed up until 2.30am, according to Denis, reading the book. For once she was listening and asking questions.' In real life, it was Bellow who first urged Bloom to put his ideas into words. He also wrote the foreword. The first line is not very affectionate: 'Professor Bloom,' he writes 'has his own way of doing things.' 'I am surprised people are treating this book as a novel when it is so clearly a memoir,' said Walden. 'So many details, down to Bloom's apartment in Chicago, are exactly described. I suppose it gives Bellow a little more leeway to make it a novel. But it is also harder for others to dispute it that way.' Bellow's 'outing' of Bloom has appalled even some of his own circle. A close acquaintance, Werner Dannhauser, does not mind his own characterisation in the book as a womaniser called Morris, but is unforgiving of the treatment of the central theme: 'I don't believe,' he says, 'that everything is justified for art.' Bloom's medical executor was Nathan Tarcov, a sage at Chicago University and son of Bellow's friend Oscar Tarcov. 'The word Aids was never mentioned when Allan died,' he insists. This week has seen Bellow on the defensive before the book is even published. 'I'm sorry to see you getting me on to this particular track,' he told one interviewer from Time magazine, 'because I don't want to be on it.' But for Walden at least, Bellow's offence is not so great. 'Bloom would not have expected anything less from Bellow,' he said. In his own book, Lucky George , he wrote: 'Between them Bloom and Bellow seem to have had a knack of exposing the underside of things.' He recounts lunching with Bloom when a jewelled cigar casket spontaneously disintegrated on contact with Bloom's hand. If Bellow justifies his picture of Bloom the promiscuous high-liver on the grounds of truth, perhaps he should be on guard. His close friend Martin Amis is about to bring out a memoir called Experience which will detail their friendship in full.",

Put bluntly, Sinn Fein and the IRA are badly split, but the 'breakaways' are themselves disparate.

For answers, The Observer turned to three people who are proud to be called republicans, but have left Sinn Fein to pursue a political space of their own. All were asked the same seven questions with the aim of gaining an audit of where republicanism stands as an ideology.</p> <p>Rory Dougan is a member of the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, which split from Sinn Fein in 1998 and is believed to be the political wing of the Real IRA. Originally from Co Armagh, Dougan now lives in Dundalk, where he will be commemorating the 1916 Rising this afternoon.</p> <p>Mairtin O Muilleoir is a former student activist who became a Sinn Fein councillor in Belfast. He left the party in 1997 and became a journalist. He is now managing editor of the Andersonstown News , the most influential publication in west Belfast. His recent book of reminiscences as a councillor, Belfast Dome of Delight, was a local bestseller.</p> <p>Tommy McKearney will spend this morning at a quiet family commemoration, remembering his two brothers, both IRA members, both shot dead by the security forces. McKearney almost died in 1980 after going 53 days without food in the first H-Block hunger strike. He is now working with former prisoners, helping them find jobs. He is also a member of the Irish Republic Writers Group and co-edits its journal Fourthwrite .</p> <p>Asked firstly if republicanism has a role in the twenty-first century, Dougan said it has the 'same role as in the twentieth and late-nineteenth century, that is to activate for an all-Ireland Republic, free from outside military and political interference'.</p> <p>O Muilleoir said that the role of republicans was 'to advance on every imaginable front to improve the quality of life for their people and to build up the communities they serve'.</p> <p>McKearney pointed out that 'there is no such thing as a republican catechism, there are no 39 Articles'. Republicanism, he believes, is 'constantly under review' and has continually changed over 100 years. At its best, it is the struggle to build democracy in Ireland and it has the potential to be a radical democratic movement.'</p> <p>Which, then, was most important - republicanism or nationalism? McKearney said that 'republicanism has to break free from nationalism, particularly the nineteenth-century form of Irish nationalism which at it best is outdated and at worst dangerous. It justifies itself in enhancing an exclusive community which leads to the exclusion of others.'</p> <p>Likewise, Dougan believes that 'in the past five years the republican movement has become more nationalist than republican'. He is concerned that the present Sinn Fein leadership 'will settle for less than the republic'.</p> <p>O Muilleoir, on the other hand, observes a 'new nationalism which is pro-peace process, is aggressively demanding equality for all and is unapologetically pro-active for its Irish identity'.</p> <p>All three stated that they believed that republicanism has an agenda which encompasses all of Ireland, not just the North. Dougan argues that Ireland can never achieve its proper sovereignty while divided in 'two partitionist states'.</p> <p>O Muilleoir relishes the 'prospect of being in government on both sides of the border' while McKearney is concerned that 'Sinn Fein are developing the party for the sake of the party.' He sees unnerving similarities between 'new Sinn Fein' and New Labour under Blair, with Gerry Adams preparing his party to go into coalition with 'right-wing' parties like Fianna Fail.</p> <p>All three also agreed that republicans need to grasp the realities of membership of the EU and the global economy. According to McKearney, globalisation, despite its problems for impoverished people, has got 'good things about it, such as the worldwide web which enhances democracy'.</p> <p>There was much sucking in of air when asked what the legacy of Gerry Adams would be. McKearney credited Adams with reorganising Sinn Fein, but 'at a certain stage, Adams created a position where he took republicans beyond their radical base, his analysis began to go fuzzy, and we now have no break in the stampede towards a reformist parliamentary system'.</p> <p>O Muilleoir cagily quoted Chou En-lai: 'It's too early to say.' Dougan said that Adams was 'probably the most pragmatic leader republicanism had since the 1920s, but squandered the chance of British withdrawal.' Dougan believes that the series of IRA 'spectaculars' such as the 1993 Baltic Exchange bomb had the British desperate for a peace settlement.</p> <p>Asked then if armed struggle will ever be justified, Dougan responded that 'If armed struggle is wrong now, it was wrong for 30 years.'But if armed struggle is right now, then the Sinn Fein strategy is wrong.'</p> <p>Dougan emphasises, though, that republicans should not show 'blind loyalty' to violence, and should condemn 'armed action' which do not 'ensure that civilians are never put at risk'.</p> <p>O Muilleoir declined to answer the question, while McKearney was very careful about his answer, stating that 'armed struggle can only be justified if there are a clear majority of people supporting it. But if a minority are trying to justify their will then it cannot be justified.'</p> <p>The three republicans were finally asked if they can see a day when republicans can share a meaningful political dialogue with unionists. Dougan said that republicans have 'no problem' entering meaningful discussions with unionists', but believes that as long as there is partition, unionists, like nationalists and republicans, 'can never achieve their full potential'.</p> <p>O Muilleoir says that 'that day has already arrived' and cites his experience on Belfast City Council, where he worked in committees with unionist councillors who are vocally opposed to the Good Friday Agreement. McKearney believes it is possible, but appreciates the difficulties in that 'republicanism and unionism are diametrically opposed philosophies'. Therefore, 'one will have to give way'.</p> <p>However, McKearney sees hope in the newer forms of politics emerging particularly among working class Protestants and speaks highly of some individuals in their Progressive Unionist Party.</p> <p>McKearney is, despite his misgivings about the Agreement, optimistic about the future: 'The potential exists for what may be the first time in more than a century for real change to happen.'</p>",

O Muilleoir declined to answer the question, while McKearney was very careful about his answer, stating that 'armed struggle can only be justified if there are a clear majority of people supporting it. But if a minority are trying to justify their will then it cannot be justified.' The three republicans were finally asked if they can see a day when republicans can share a meaningful political dialogue with unionists. Dougan said that republicans have 'no problem' entering meaningful discussions with unionists', but believes that as long as there is partition, unionists, like nationalists and republicans, 'can never achieve their full potential'. O Muilleoir says that 'that day has already arrived' and cites his experience on Belfast City Council, where he worked in committees with unionist councillors who are vocally opposed to the Good Friday Agreement. McKearney believes it is possible, but appreciates the difficulties in that 'republicanism and unionism are diametrically opposed philosophies'. Therefore, 'one will have to give way'. However, McKearney sees hope in the newer forms of politics emerging particularly among working class Protestants and speaks highly of some individuals in their Progressive Unionist Party. McKearney is, despite his misgivings about the Agreement, optimistic about the future: 'The potential exists for what may be the first time in more than a century for real change to happen.'",
