UK mail order sales dropped 7% in the same months because of a continued lack of demand for clothing. GUS's credit information business, Experian, saw profits expand 3.5% to \u00a3200.6m. Its Burberry business benefited from a new management and repositioning of its brand; its profits in the year doubled to \u00a321.7m. The company has renegotiated its Japanese licence, and this is expected to add \u00a335m to profits by 2006.",

The companies, Boston-based Battery Ventures and New York-based Blackstone Group, will end up with a stake of between 25% and 38% in the exchange, which is in the throes of dividing its business between its traditional trading activities and Liffe.com, its computer software arm. As part of its radical plan to reinvent itself after transferring its business from tightly packed trading pits into computer clicks, the exchange yesterday revealed that it was teaming up with Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young, the technology consultants, to try to sell its Liffe Connect electronic trading software to other groups.

With the help of Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young, Liffe hopes to be able to persuade potential users yet to embrace new technology, as well as established exchanges including arch rival Eurex in Germany, to buy Liffe Connect.

At at time when stock exchanges around the world are racing to merge - including the exchanges in London and Germany as well as a separate initiative by 10 exchanges around the world - Liffe's chairman, Brian Williamson, said he felt technology partnerships were more important. \"Of course we're talking to other exchanges but we'll be talking to them in another way about technology links,\" Mr Williamson said. Liffe will offer its existing shareholders - banks, brokers and traders - the opportunity to take \u00a320m of the \u00a360m of additional financing at \u00a36 a share. The venture capital firms will put in between \u00a340m and \u00a360m depending on the uptake of Liffe's shareholders whose shares were last valued at \u00a33.85. Battery Ventures and Blackstone Group will also be granted warrants to subscribed for Liffe shares at \u00a312 but prevented from taking a stake of more than 40% in the shares. Shareholders will need to approve the exchange's plans to alter its share capital at an extraordinary general meeting in August.",

Windows it was who gave point and pleasure to the cricket, which in atmosphere was a good deal more than 120 miles from Lord's. </p> <p>Small, compact and supremely confident, Windows scored his third hundred in a row off Essex. He was fluent from the start of the second day yesterday, off-driving with a stylish sweep of the bat or clipping through midwicket. Once on seven and again in the 90s he was close to being caught at slip, but who was counting? </p> <p>When he is going well like this Windows rekindles his candidature for test consideration. If he was inclined occasionally to be too eager outside the off stump, it could perhaps be put down to rehearsal time for the looming match with Glamorgan. There were 20 boundaries, all pugnaciously directed from his sturdy forearms - and then he whacked straight to cover. </p> <p>Gloucestershire were all out for 268, a modest lead of five runs. It was better than looked likely when Tim Hancock was out to the fifth ball of the day, soon to be followed by Rob Cunliffe, a talented, nervous and under-achieving batsman, and Mark Alleyne. Just as well Chris Taylor came in next, ready to stay for an hour and a half in partnership with Windows. </p> <p>Last week Taylor created history by scoring a century at Lord's on his county debut. He looks younger, though he is 23, than anyone else on the circuit and has the neat, slim appearance of a boy soprano. As someone who by nature goes for his shots, he paraded here a thoroughly defensive bat.

      "bodyText": "Matt Windows yesterday broke the pattern of a match that had never seemed in much of a hurry or possessed of too much meaning. Spectators were relatively few, as if saving up their pounds for a visit to the Benson &amp; Hedges final on Saturday. Windows it was who gave point and pleasure to the cricket, which in atmosphere was a good deal more than 120 miles from Lord's. Small, compact and supremely confident, Windows scored his third hundred in a row off Essex. He was fluent from the start of the second day yesterday, off-driving with a stylish sweep of the bat or clipping through midwicket. Once on seven and again in the 90s he was close to being caught at slip, but who was counting? When he is going well like this Windows rekindles his candidature for test consideration. If he was inclined occasionally to be too eager outside the off stump, it could perhaps be put down to rehearsal time for the looming match with Glamorgan. There were 20 boundaries, all pugnaciously directed from his sturdy forearms - and then he whacked straight to cover. Gloucestershire were all out for 268, a modest lead of five runs. It was better than looked likely when Tim Hancock was out to the fifth ball of the day, soon to be followed by Rob Cunliffe, a talented, nervous and under-achieving batsman, and Mark Alleyne. Just as well Chris Taylor came in next, ready to stay for an hour and a half in partnership with Windows. Last week Taylor created history by scoring a century at Lord's on his county debut. He looks younger, though he is 23, than anyone else on the circuit and has the neat, slim appearance of a boy soprano. As someone who by nature goes for his shots, he paraded here a thoroughly defensive bat. He knows he is in the squad of 14 and he wanted to avoid any untimely aberration. A succession of savaged schoolboy and club bowlers will vouch for his deceptive stroke play. Gloucestershire are a team lacking in inches though not team spirit, and Jeremy Snape is no taller than Windows or Taylor. His carefully made half-century, augmented by Mike Cawdron's assured runs and Reggie Williams's dogged blocking, helped take them past Essex's total. The Essex bowling was not particularly penetrative after the early inroads by Ronnie Irani and Mark Ilott. Stuart Law's catching was strangely fallible. And when it was their turn to bat again they lost Paul Prichard and Barry Hyam to second slip, leaving them with a fragile lead of 17.",

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points.

      "bodyText": "Hansie Cronje approached his team-mate Pat Symcox to discuss an offer for throwing a match during his first season as South Africa captain, it was claimed yesterday on the opening day of the King commission into match-fixing. Symcox alleged that Cronje had discussed with him an approach to throw a one-day game against Pakistan in 1995 - almost two years before the much-publicised offer made to the team in India which Cronje maintains was the first and only offer he received. \"It was the day before the Mandela Cup match at Newlands, in Cape Town [January 10, 1995], and Hansie called me to his room and we chatted about the match and a few things,\" said Symcox, the former test off-spinner. \"Then he said he had been made an offer to lose the match and wanted to know whether he should put it to the team. I told him it was a bad idea and that he shouldn't worry about it. \"I said I thought we could beat Pakistan anyway and we should just concentrate on the cricket.\" South Africa went on to win the match by 37 runs. Cronje, who is not expected to take the stand for two weeks, has previously stated that he has never approached a team-mate with an offer. Symcox, testifying under oath, then revealed that a further offer of a bribe was made during that same Indian tour in December 1996 by \"a current international player, not a South African\", whom he referred to as Mr X. \"He approached me in the lobby of our hotel in either Bombay or Delhi and asked if I was interested in getting involved in a bit of gambling,\" Symcox said. \"I said no, I couldn't.\" The United Cricket Board of South Africa's advocate, Jeremy Gauntlett, asked Symcox why these offers had not previously been reported, either at the time or subsequently. \"I don't know,\" Symcox replied. The 40-year-old veteran of 20 tests also shed further light on the much-reported offer made in Mumbai in December 1996, which the South Africans turned down at a team meeting. Symcox said he believed the offer was for $250,000 [\u00a3160,000]. \"It was the first time any of us, especially myself, had this sort of thing thrown at us. We thought: 'It's quite a lot of money, maybe we should look at it'.\" He said the offer came at the end of a \"very tough tour\" for a match which the South Africans did not believe was worthy of official one-day international status. \"Hansie called a meeting in his room.

At that point Cronje said it was \"no go\". But Symcox said that he and some other players, including Dave Richardson and the all-rounder Brian McMillan, had stayed in Cronje's room. \"We laughed and joked about it. Then someone said, 'Why not see if we can get something more out of it?' \" Symcox said Cronje picked up his telephone and made a call. \"Then he said there was another $100,000 (\u00a365,000).

      "body": "<p>Lothar Matth\u00e4us could have found a more obscure stage upon which to rehearse Germany's challenge for Euro 2000 but it might well have meant using a beach, a plastic ball and two sets of denim jackets. </p> <p>Allow no one to persuade you that professional football - or soccer - is anywhere near taking off in the United States. The success of the World Cup here in 1994 was testament to the country's expertise in staging big events, not to the emergence of a sport to challenge baseball, basketball and the National Football League; the excitement generated last year by the US team's victory in the women's version is remembered mainly for Brandi Chastain removing her shirt after scoring a penalty. </p> <p>Try calling Giants stadium, home of the New York/ New Jersey MetroStars, where Matth\u00e4us has enjoyed/endured a short dalliance before returning to Europe to take part in the world's second biggest tournament. The public affairs office at the ground where the infinitely more popular New York Giants and the New York Jets American football teams also play seemed unaware of who Octavio Zambrano was, even when informed that he was the coach of the stadium's soccer franchise. </p> <p>Zambrano flew to Spain a few weeks before the Major League Soccer season started to make sure that the 39-year-old holder of a record 146 international caps knew what he was letting himself in for when he quit Bayern Munich in March. </p> <p>\"I went with the mission to really and truly spell it out to him,\" said Zambrano. \"Lothar was told very clearly that this was not going to be Bayern Munich or Inter Milan or the German national team. I wanted to make sure he got the clear picture, that he was not painted a rosy picture. I wanted to bring him to reality.\" </p> <p>Whatever effect this mercy dash might have had - and Matth\u00e4us arrived more than two months later than initially planned - reality cannot have bitten until the veteran of five World Cups had slung his bags into Trump Tower, his home on Manhattan's west side, and made his way to the stadium 15 minutes away across the Hudson river in New Jersey. </p> <p>If Giants stadium is only reputed to be the last resting place of the Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa, there is no doubt about the form of the soccer team who play there. The MetroStars have been dismal and last year's record was seven wins and 25 defeats, the worst in the MLS's four full seasons. </p> <p>\"This is a very difficult situation for me,\" said Matth\u00e4us. \"At Bayern Munich we were always in first place or second place. Inter Milan was the same. This is a new situation.\" </p> <p>Right enough. Matth\u00e4us's last game for Bayern was a 4-1 win over the soon-to-be European champions Real Madrid before a crowd of 64,000. </p> <p>When the MetroStars score - and they have actually done better since Matth\u00e4us left to join the Germany side - the celebrations are led by footage on giant screens of Jackie Gleason performing what looks like an elephant dance in the 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners. Among the biggest cheers are those at half-time when freebies are catapulted into the crowd. </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us has not lasted long on his initial foray into the US game but he and his coach say he will be back to fulfil a reported $1.5m (\u00a31m) contract for the season. Nor was it a spell of unalloyed joy for the German sweeper, a temperamental conductor with too many passengers on his bus. </p> <p>He lost it completely five weeks ago in the course of defeat by Kansas City, tearing off his captain's armband and throwing it at an official, then declining to play for a few minutes. Zambrano and the MetroStars' general manager Nick Sakiewicz had words with him afterwards. </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us made it plain that he was not willing to tolerate team-mates who played well in training and lost their nerve during matches, and that he had lost patience with the players' tendency to lump the ball upfield at every opportunity. But there is another problem: English. Matth\u00e4us concedes that he cannot speak the language well, but the team's Colombian strikers Adolfo Valencia and Alex Comas cannot understand it at all. </p> <p>\"My English is not very good but I understand when a guy says to me, 'Lothar, go right.' When I play a good ball and I say, 'Comas, go right,' and he goes left I lose the ball.\" </p> <p>Zambrano, a 42-year-old from Ecuador, is a man blessed with forbearance. \"The whole issue with Lothar... it's not a big issue. I see it as part of the transition this club is going through. He had a tough time adjusting to the soccer culture in this country.\" </p> <p>The coach refuses to accept that Matth\u00e4us might have damaged his chance of having a good Euro 2000 by playing in the US. \"I don't think he's been short-changed at all. He trains in the same way; everything is the same. The only thing that makes a difference is the level of the players. </p> <p>\"He says some things that may offend people but at least he says it straight out. I think I know him well enough to know that is just the way he is.\" </p> <p>Despite his recent travails and the national team's indifferent form Matth\u00e4us remains confident about what must surely be his final top-level tournament. \"I want to leave on a high note,\" he said. \"I'm going to play like I never played before. I've given my soul to this team. I'm not going to let it die.\" </p> <p>He has been troubled by a thigh strain and limped out of last night's 8-2 victory over Liechtenstein after half an hour as a \"precaution\". But it will take a lot to keep him out of Germany's encounter with England on Saturday week. </p> <p>His club coach, meanwhile, was sounding an optimistic note about the future of football in the US. \"Without a doubt we need a generation of fanatics,\" said Zambrano. \"Once this becomes a 20-year league, another 15 years, I think the league will grow and be healthy.\" By then Lothar Matth\u00e4us will be only 54.</p>",

The success of the World Cup here in 1994 was testament to the country's expertise in staging big events, not to the emergence of a sport to challenge baseball, basketball and the National Football League; the excitement generated last year by the US team's victory in the women's version is remembered mainly for Brandi Chastain removing her shirt after scoring a penalty. Try calling Giants stadium, home of the New York/ New Jersey MetroStars, where Matth\u00e4us has enjoyed/endured a short dalliance before returning to Europe to take part in the world's second biggest tournament. The public affairs office at the ground where the infinitely more popular New York Giants and the New York Jets American football teams also play seemed unaware of who Octavio Zambrano was, even when informed that he was the coach of the stadium's soccer franchise. Zambrano flew to Spain a few weeks before the Major League Soccer season started to make sure that the 39-year-old holder of a record 146 international caps knew what he was letting himself in for when he quit Bayern Munich in March. \"I went with the mission to really and truly spell it out to him,\" said Zambrano. \"Lothar was told very clearly that this was not going to be Bayern Munich or Inter Milan or the German national team. I wanted to make sure he got the clear picture, that he was not painted a rosy picture. I wanted to bring him to reality.\" Whatever effect this mercy dash might have had - and Matth\u00e4us arrived more than two months later than initially planned - reality cannot have bitten until the veteran of five World Cups had slung his bags into Trump Tower, his home on Manhattan's west side, and made his way to the stadium 15 minutes away across the Hudson river in New Jersey. If Giants stadium is only reputed to be the last resting place of the Teamsters union boss Jimmy Hoffa, there is no doubt about the form of the soccer team who play there. The MetroStars have been dismal and last year's record was seven wins and 25 defeats, the worst in the MLS's four full seasons. \"This is a very difficult situation for me,\" said Matth\u00e4us. \"At Bayern Munich we were always in first place or second place. Inter Milan was the same. This is a new situation.\" Right enough. Matth\u00e4us's last game for Bayern was a 4-1 win over the soon-to-be European champions Real Madrid before a crowd of 64,000. When the MetroStars score - and they have actually done better since Matth\u00e4us left to join the Germany side - the celebrations are led by footage on giant screens of Jackie Gleason performing what looks like an elephant dance in the 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners. Among the biggest cheers are those at half-time when freebies are catapulted into the crowd. Matth\u00e4us has not lasted long on his initial foray into the US game but he and his coach say he will be back to fulfil a reported $1.5m (\u00a31m) contract for the season. Nor was it a spell of unalloyed joy for the German sweeper, a temperamental conductor with too many passengers on his bus. He lost it completely five weeks ago in the course of defeat by Kansas City, tearing off his captain's armband and throwing it at an official, then declining to play for a few minutes. Zambrano and the MetroStars' general manager Nick Sakiewicz had words with him afterwards. Matth\u00e4us made it plain that he was not willing to tolerate team-mates who played well in training and lost their nerve during matches, and that he had lost patience with the players' tendency to lump the ball upfield at every opportunity. But there is another problem: English. Matth\u00e4us concedes that he cannot speak the language well, but the team's Colombian strikers Adolfo Valencia and Alex Comas cannot understand it at all. \"My English is not very good but I understand when a guy says to me, 'Lothar, go right.' When I play a good ball and I say, 'Comas, go right,' and he goes left I lose the ball.\" Zambrano, a 42-year-old from Ecuador, is a man blessed with forbearance. \"The whole issue with Lothar... it's not a big issue. I see it as part of the transition this club is going through. He had a tough time adjusting to the soccer culture in this country.\" The coach refuses to accept that Matth\u00e4us might have damaged his chance of having a good Euro 2000 by playing in the US. \"I don't think he's been short-changed at all. He trains in the same way; everything is the same. The only thing that makes a difference is the level of the players. \"He says some things that may offend people but at least he says it straight out. I think I know him well enough to know that is just the way he is.\" Despite his recent travails and the national team's indifferent form Matth\u00e4us remains confident about what must surely be his final top-level tournament. \"I want to leave on a high note,\" he said. \"I'm going to play like I never played before. I've given my soul to this team. I'm not going to let it die.\" He has been troubled by a thigh strain and limped out of last night's 8-2 victory over Liechtenstein after half an hour as a \"precaution\". But it will take a lot to keep him out of Germany's encounter with England on Saturday week. His club coach, meanwhile, was sounding an optimistic note about the future of football in the US. \"Without a doubt we need a generation of fanatics,\" said Zambrano. \"Once this becomes a 20-year league, another 15 years, I think the league will grow and be healthy.\" By then Lothar Matth\u00e4us will be only 54.",

But if it is indeed true, as the novelist Vladimir Nabokov says, that the letter \"s\" is the only difference between the cosmic and the comic, especially as far as sex is concerned, some of us are right to regard him as a precious talent.

Admittedly, it is weird enough to make them sit up and pay attention, and the musical score, just about the first to use period instruments, would almost certainly be fashionable if put on record today. </p> <p>Blanche is set in 13th-century France where Simon, who must have been well over 80 at the time, plays an almost senile baron with a simple but beautiful young wife (Branice) who everyone, including the King, lusts after. There is a lecherous page and a handsome but rather vacant lover too, and the film is a kind of fairytale dance of death where tragedy is probable, even if a happy outcome isn't entirely out of the question. </p> <p>Almost the whole film takes place in the Baron's castle, where the king comes to stay. And its winding stone staircases, gloomy corridors and rooms full of bizarre decor and mechanical devices are as important as any characters in the film. Once again, every tiny detail is made to count double. </p> <p>Blanche, who climbs naked out of her bath early in the film, has a pet white dove in a cage, which is almost her alter ego as she flutters round her admirers, half frightened and half fascinated. She is a creature made for trouble and it isn't a total surprise when she is bricked into one of the castle walls. </p> <p>Borowczyk's art, which often looks like a carefully animated painting, and has the pessimistic urge one associates with Franz Kafka, is invariably about sex, love and death - the ape in The Beast eventually dies of pleasure. But his eye is so sharp and his ironic sense of humour so audacious that even the worst of his films, such as Emmanuelle 5, are worth something.

Blanche is set in 13th-century France where Simon, who must have been well over 80 at the time, plays an almost senile baron with a simple but beautiful young wife (Branice) who everyone, including the King, lusts after. There is a lecherous page and a handsome but rather vacant lover too, and the film is a kind of fairytale dance of death where tragedy is probable, even if a happy outcome isn't entirely out of the question. Almost the whole film takes place in the Baron's castle, where the king comes to stay. And its winding stone staircases, gloomy corridors and rooms full of bizarre decor and mechanical devices are as important as any characters in the film. Once again, every tiny detail is made to count double. Blanche, who climbs naked out of her bath early in the film, has a pet white dove in a cage, which is almost her alter ego as she flutters round her admirers, half frightened and half fascinated. She is a creature made for trouble and it isn't a total surprise when she is bricked into one of the castle walls. Borowczyk's art, which often looks like a carefully animated painting, and has the pessimistic urge one associates with Franz Kafka, is invariably about sex, love and death - the ape in The Beast eventually dies of pleasure. But his eye is so sharp and his ironic sense of humour so audacious that even the worst of his films, such as Emmanuelle 5, are worth something. The best inhabit a world you are unlikely to forget.",

Hot on the heels of <a href=\"http://www.healthinfocus.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Health In Focus</a> and the launch of the internet arm of <a href=\"http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk\">NHS Direct</a> last December came <a href=\"http://www.surgerydoor.co.uk\">Surgery Door</a> and <a href=\"http://www.netdoctor.co.uk \">NetDoctor</a>, offering the latest health news, medical advice, self-testing questionnaires, email services and online chats with doctors. Doctors can switch on the Medical Channel, a new digital television channel for health professionals, which buys its news from Health-Media.Net, another flourishing online health information provider. </p> <p>These new ventures have been encouraged by the excellent prognosis for the online health industry - worth $10bn by 2004, says Jupiter Communications. Forrester Research's calculations are closer to $37bn, suggesting that a money-spinning 8% of all retail health sales will have moved online by 2004. </p> <p>Yet the latest news from the US sounds less lucrative. Despite a million registered users and quarterly revenue of more than $5m, <a href=\"http://www.drkoop.com\">Drkoop.com</a>, a health portal founded by a former US surgeon general C Everett Koop, has funds for only another four months. </p> <p>Healthshop.com recently laid off workers and halted sales, despite having more than 1.1million unique users each month and receiving $25m last autumn. </p> <p>Unable to subsist on advertising alone, these sites' wait for the predicted boom in medicinal e-commerce may be a long one. The internet appears an ideal medium for dispensing medical advice (and pills): interactive and, crucially, for those embar rassing itches, anonymous. But more than half 1,600 consumers surveyed by Jupiter Communications prefer the convenience of the high street when buying drugs. </p> <p>More importantly, they are likely to trust their chemist more than the internet, which is renowned for its virulent rumours and scare stories. An investigation by American gastroenterologists concluded that one in 10 sites in the field contained treatment information that was \"unproven or outright quackery\". </p> <p>In the UK, an investigation by the Consumers Association this week found online chemists only too willing to dole out drugs without thoroughly checking patients' medical histories. Five UK prescription drug sites supplied a slimming drug to a researcher posing as someone whose medical history made it an inappropriate treatment. </p> <p>Another site supplied Viagra to a researcher, when a doctor would have looked at his record of nitrate therapy for heart trouble and declared the drug too risky. The Health Which? report also criticised sites for not naming doctors or showing their qualifications. </p> <p>The US online health industry fell sick by failing to involve medical professionals, says Tim Nater, executive director of Health on the Net Foundation (Hon), a not-for-profit web watchdog based in Geneva. \"In the States, e-health has been built up largely in the absence of doctors and nurses,\" he says. \"A lot of companies are rising to the wrong challenge. They are in it for the money and not for the public service.\" </p> <p>A Hon study found lack of time to be the biggest obstacle to doctors and nurses getting involved in e-health. With a couple of days a week in his Stroud surgery and media work for BBC1, Radio 2, the Sunday Mirror and Women's Realm, it is surprising Dr Mark Porter has any time to devote to Surgery Door, the UK health portal of which he is medical editor. </p> <p>Porter's consumer friendly face is the lynchpin of Surgery Door's appeal for the trust of the British consumer. \"His career would be dead overnight if we overstepped the line between ethical health and commercialism,\" says managing director Paul Blackburn. </p> <p>UK health sites could learn from American mistakes. Dr Koop's professional standing was tarnished when his website got its knuckles rapped for failing to label clearly advertising content. US sites were also hit by a recent privacy scare, after the California HealthCare Foundation discovered that many, including Drkoop, OnHealth and WebMD, were sharing information about their users with third parties. This could be used to compile medical profiles of those who turned to the net precisely because of its supposed anonymity. </p> <p>Surgery Door \"doesn't collect any information about users\", says Blackburn. Porter is equally anxious to ensure that commercial imperatives do not cloud its health information. \"We go great lengths to show who we are involved with and why we are pukka,\" says Porter. \"Good sites provide information and services for free. Alongside that we'll run links, sponsorship and advertising, but that should not interfere with any of the content, exactly the same as with a newspaper.\" </p> <p>Nater hopes \"there is no way the American e-health model is going to be picked up and used in Europe\". But the NHS's online offering has, so far, disappointed doctors. Medical advice and content is thin and earlier this month it was still promoting an event held on March 20. </p> <p>Online health provision should not go too far, suggests Porter, dismissing the possibility of online consultations: \"I don't know a decent doctor who reckons he or she could do a proper job during an online consultation. To pretend you can and charge money for it is wrong.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, the internet's potential to improve health services is \"unlimited\", he believes. For example, patients could book their own appointments online or use a Wap phone to find out where their nearest hospital is and who sells aspirin at 1am. </p> <p>In the meantime, while the public is faced with fairly ordinary online health services which Porter admits \"are still finding their feet\" in the UK, medical professionals can access information of cast-iron integrity on sites such as US-based Medline and Health-Media.Net. Alongside the question of how online health services can benefit those without internet access, the success of exclusive professional sites suggests the web may not be the hoped-for panacea for reducing the inequalities in public health. </p> <p>However, health professionals say there has to be some separation between what they and the public can get on the net. Gill Shearer, editor-in-chief of subscriber-based Health-Media Net, says they must offer a private platform for doctors. \"We can't have consumers entering [online] discussions they would be confused and misled by. There are patient confidentiality issues as well,\" she says. Porter agrees, pointing out that professional sites also have to be restricted because many contain adverts which would break the strict UK rules for advertising medicines direct to the public. </p> <p>But Nater believes global rules are really needed to shape up the internet. Four years ago, Hon \"recognised the need for a basic ethical standard\"; 3,000 sites now subscribe to its code in 36 different countries. Three similar ethics codes have been published in the US this year and Nater fears this proliferation risks confusing users. </p> <p>\"We should work for a single global code,\" says Nater, although he hopes for more. Ethical standards are all very well, but \"what is much more important is compliance and enforcement\". </p> <p>Until we have this, punters seeking good health online had best beware. </p> <p> <strong>Health warnings: </strong> Dos and don'ts </p> <p> <strong> Do</strong> look for the Health on the Net Foundation (Hon) guarantee on the website.

      "bodyText": "The South African inquiry into match-fixing allegations against former national captain Hansie Cronje on Thursday received a copy of his hand-written midnight confession made in April. The confession was handed to United Cricket Board (UCB) security chief Rory Steyn in the early hours of April 11 2000, after news had broken in India that Cronje was to be charged on the basis of a recorded telephone discussion about match fixing. Here is a partial text of the statement: \"I have been a Christian since childhood days when I grew up in the house of two wonderful people, Ewie and San-Marie Cronje.

      "body": "<p><strong>VILLA-FIED</strong></p> <p>For some time now, John Gregory has been known in these pages as football's Mr Angry. His inability to stop shooting his mouth off - \"They can keep charging me and fining me, but it's not going to shut me up\" - combined with a complete absence of sensitivity - anyone recall an incident involving a shotgun? - endeared him to the Fiver no end. Sadly for John, it doesn't appear to have had the same affect on his players, who are jumping ship faster than you can say \"no European place for a second season running\".</p> <p>\"I have given everything to Villa over the last few years but if I am to achieve what I want to achieve in my career it is time to move on.\" That's what Gareth Southgate had to say this morning after he faxed his transfer request to the club. \"It is not a decision that has been easy but my mind is made up,\" said the skipper who is as synonymous with Villa as Ian Wright is with chicken. Southgate is valued (who by? Christie's?) at \u00a38m and everyone from Man Utd to Paris St Germain are said to be interested. Not the best news for Aston Villa Football Club.</p> <p>Neither is the (admittedly slightly less significant) news that Julian Joachim is also on his bike. \"I just feel that I cannot play for John Gregory anymore and don't want to,\" said Joachim, who claims Gregory reneged on an agreement to improve his contract after the 1998-99 season. \"I am disappointed at the manager and the club.\" Add this to Ugo Ehiogu's transfer request (caused by a \"personality clash\" with the manager), and the likely prospect of neither Paul Merson nor Benito Carbone playing at Villa Park this season and you get the general idea. Well done John.</p> <p><strong>SUBSCRIBE TO THE EURO</strong></p> <p>It arrives very early in the morning, so no wonder it's a bit tired. It's the Euro.

An inclusive AA service offering routes, traffic reports, practical advice and lots more.</p> <p><strong>KING KOOGAN'S RALLYING CRY</strong></p> <p>The England squad were given a rousing send-off as they flew out from Heathrow this afternoon. Well, a Sky TV crew and a couple of American tourists turned up (everyone else had gone to Luton by mistake). Although Kelvin Koogan tried to keep the spirits up in the style of Henry V - \"We're going out there to try to do the business for all these wonderful fans who've come to give us a send-off\" - the rest of the squad didn't seem too happy. Especially Michael Owen.</p> <p>\"Hopefully when we come back there will be more people cheering a winning side,\" was the refreshingly honest verdict of England's boy wonder, before he succumbed to Koogan-itis (ie: his utterances took a turn towards the vacuous). \"It's been a long build-up,\" Owen continued. \"We've had our plusses and minuses and we just want to get cracking now. A lot can happen but I'm hopeful of playing.\"</p> <p>But who he'll be playing alongside is a moot point, because Alan Shearer is still not at full fitness. \"I had a scan this morning just as a precaution to see if there's anything in there,\" revealed Shearer, talking, we presume, about his injured left-knee rather than Phil Neville's left boot. \"We'll wait for the results and take it from there. I don't think it will be a problem.\" And Koogan agreed. Asked when the deadline would be for Shearer to prove his fitness, Koog said: \"When's the kick-off? The deadline is the kick-off. I think he will be fine. He's confident and we're confident.\" If only the Fiver could say the same thing.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We'll be signing Elvis Presley next\" - Busy Peter Ridsdale responds to this morning's reports that Leeds were set to sign Celtic striker Mark Viduka.</p> <p><strong>THE SECRET LIFE OF BUILDINGS</strong></p> <p>Hello there. I'm Filbert Street, the home of Leicester City. I'm glad I've got your ear. People don't talk to buildings very much, you know, which is a real shame, because we've got plenty of things to tell you. Take this morning, for example. There I was, standing dead still and minding my own business, when all of a sudden my doors were prised open and several Leicester board members and some representatives from cable company NTL inserted themselves into me.</p> <p>As I housed them within my walls, they struck a deal. NTL will give the club an \u00a311.5m interest-free loan, which they will be able to convert into a 9.99% stake in the club next year. The cable guys, who already have similar stakes in Aston Villa and Newcastle, will also pay the Foxes \u00a31m for media and sponsorship rights. Once the deal was finalised, out they all popped, quicker than Leicester suit Steve Kind could say the cash would be spent on \"strengthening of the professional playing squad, development of youth academy and training facilities, and the enhancement of stadium capacity\".</p> <p>Now, that may not seem too important to Leicester fans on a day which saw Celtic target Matt Elliott sign a 12-month extension to his contract which will keep him with the club until 2004. And it may seem trivial compared to Muzzy Izzet's denial of reports that he will leave on a Bosman free at the end of next season - \"I want to stay with Leicester. Once Euro 2000 is out of the way I plan to resume negotiations with the club,\" he insisted today. But look at it from my point of view: stadium enhancement is stadium enhancement, and I love a lick of paint, me.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Lee Clark could be set to join the third North-eastern club of his career by joining Middlesbrough for \u00a32.5m. Fulham midfielder Clark is believed to be unhappy in London and would jump at the chance of a move to the Riverside.</p> <p>Bobby Robson has been linked with a \u00a37m move to bring Carl Cort to St James Park. The 22-year-old striker, who scored 15 goals last term, submitted a transfer request to Wimbledon last week.</p> <p>Legendary French defender Lilian Thuram is believed to have had preliminary talks with Arsene Wenger over a summer move to Highbury.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>The Swedish squad have denied there is a sex ban in their training camp. \"It's just a rumour. I don't know where it comes from. When we are in the camp here we don't have any wives so obviously there's no sex either,\" claimed Fredrik Ljungberg.

      "bodyText": "VILLA-FIED For some time now, John Gregory has been known in these pages as football's Mr Angry. His inability to stop shooting his mouth off - \"They can keep charging me and fining me, but it's not going to shut me up\" - combined with a complete absence of sensitivity - anyone recall an incident involving a shotgun? - endeared him to the Fiver no end. Sadly for John, it doesn't appear to have had the same affect on his players, who are jumping ship faster than you can say \"no European place for a second season running\". \"I have given everything to Villa over the last few years but if I am to achieve what I want to achieve in my career it is time to move on.\" That's what Gareth Southgate had to say this morning after he faxed his transfer request to the club. \"It is not a decision that has been easy but my mind is made up,\" said the skipper who is as synonymous with Villa as Ian Wright is with chicken. Southgate is valued (who by? Christie's?) at \u00a38m and everyone from Man Utd to Paris St Germain are said to be interested. Not the best news for Aston Villa Football Club. Neither is the (admittedly slightly less significant) news that Julian Joachim is also on his bike. \"I just feel that I cannot play for John Gregory anymore and don't want to,\" said Joachim, who claims Gregory reneged on an agreement to improve his contract after the 1998-99 season. \"I am disappointed at the manager and the club.\" Add this to Ugo Ehiogu's transfer request (caused by a \"personality clash\" with the manager), and the likely prospect of neither Paul Merson nor Benito Carbone playing at Villa Park this season and you get the general idea. Well done John. SUBSCRIBE TO THE EURO It arrives very early in the morning, so no wonder it's a bit tired. It's the Euro.

KING KOOGAN'S RALLYING CRY The England squad were given a rousing send-off as they flew out from Heathrow this afternoon. Well, a Sky TV crew and a couple of American tourists turned up (everyone else had gone to Luton by mistake). Although Kelvin Koogan tried to keep the spirits up in the style of Henry V - \"We're going out there to try to do the business for all these wonderful fans who've come to give us a send-off\" - the rest of the squad didn't seem too happy. Especially Michael Owen. \"Hopefully when we come back there will be more people cheering a winning side,\" was the refreshingly honest verdict of England's boy wonder, before he succumbed to Koogan-itis (ie: his utterances took a turn towards the vacuous). \"It's been a long build-up,\" Owen continued. \"We've had our plusses and minuses and we just want to get cracking now. A lot can happen but I'm hopeful of playing.\" But who he'll be playing alongside is a moot point, because Alan Shearer is still not at full fitness. \"I had a scan this morning just as a precaution to see if there's anything in there,\" revealed Shearer, talking, we presume, about his injured left-knee rather than Phil Neville's left boot. \"We'll wait for the results and take it from there. I don't think it will be a problem.\" And Koogan agreed. Asked when the deadline would be for Shearer to prove his fitness, Koog said: \"When's the kick-off? The deadline is the kick-off. I think he will be fine. He's confident and we're confident.\" If only the Fiver could say the same thing. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We'll be signing Elvis Presley next\" - Busy Peter Ridsdale responds to this morning's reports that Leeds were set to sign Celtic striker Mark Viduka. THE SECRET LIFE OF BUILDINGS Hello there. I'm Filbert Street, the home of Leicester City. I'm glad I've got your ear. People don't talk to buildings very much, you know, which is a real shame, because we've got plenty of things to tell you. Take this morning, for example. There I was, standing dead still and minding my own business, when all of a sudden my doors were prised open and several Leicester board members and some representatives from cable company NTL inserted themselves into me. As I housed them within my walls, they struck a deal. NTL will give the club an \u00a311.5m interest-free loan, which they will be able to convert into a 9.99% stake in the club next year. The cable guys, who already have similar stakes in Aston Villa and Newcastle, will also pay the Foxes \u00a31m for media and sponsorship rights. Once the deal was finalised, out they all popped, quicker than Leicester suit Steve Kind could say the cash would be spent on \"strengthening of the professional playing squad, development of youth academy and training facilities, and the enhancement of stadium capacity\". Now, that may not seem too important to Leicester fans on a day which saw Celtic target Matt Elliott sign a 12-month extension to his contract which will keep him with the club until 2004. And it may seem trivial compared to Muzzy Izzet's denial of reports that he will leave on a Bosman free at the end of next season - \"I want to stay with Leicester. Once Euro 2000 is out of the way I plan to resume negotiations with the club,\" he insisted today. But look at it from my point of view: stadium enhancement is stadium enhancement, and I love a lick of paint, me. THE RUMOUR MILL Lee Clark could be set to join the third North-eastern club of his career by joining Middlesbrough for \u00a32.5m. Fulham midfielder Clark is believed to be unhappy in London and would jump at the chance of a move to the Riverside. Bobby Robson has been linked with a \u00a37m move to bring Carl Cort to St James Park. The 22-year-old striker, who scored 15 goals last term, submitted a transfer request to Wimbledon last week. Legendary French defender Lilian Thuram is believed to have had preliminary talks with Arsene Wenger over a summer move to Highbury. NEWS IN BRIEF The Swedish squad have denied there is a sex ban in their training camp. \"It's just a rumour. I don't know where it comes from. When we are in the camp here we don't have any wives so obviously there's no sex either,\" claimed Fredrik Ljungberg. And striker Henrik Larsson was flummoxed when asked what the players' reaction had been to the reported ban. \"A ban on sex? What do you mean?\" he said. \"It's hard when your wife's not here,\" he added, unnecessarily. Rangers have signed Danish youngster Peter Lovenkrands after the striker was advised to commit himself to the Glasgow giants by former Ibrox star Brian Laudrup. Ian Wright's career may not be over after all, according to close friend Mark Bright. \"It's not true, I spoke to him yesterday,\" said Bright. \"He's got to have an operation on Monday on his ankle and once that is done and he sees how his recovery is then he will make a final decision.\" Marc Overmars has resumed training with the Dutch squad, easing fears about his thigh injury. \"I think I should be completely ready in two or three days,\" Overmars said. \"I want to make history with this team and win the European Championships.\" TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: World Football (2.30am) Two very big things.

It was not reintroduced prior to Euro 2000 because the legislative time was not available, he said.</p> <p>Mr Aigner defended the decision to stage the England-Germany game in Charleroi, claiming its suitability as a venue was not questioned until it was too late. \"Over the last three years, both Uefa and the organisers, together with the authorities in both host countries, have carefully prepared the event,\" he said. \"At no time did the authorities make any reservations with regard to the use of the stadiums, including the one in Charleroi, for the matches to be played there.\"</p> <p>Reacting to Mr Aigner's criticism, Mr Straw said the NCIS had launched the most extensive and sophisticated operation ever for a big overseas tournament.</p> <p>Officers from 19 regional police forces have been seconded to the football unit and will work closely with spotters on the ground in Belgium and Holland to monitor the movement of English hooligans.</p> <p>The unit has identified 99 people against whom there are international banning orders, 416 subject to domestic banning orders and hundreds with no football-related convictions but suspected of being involved in related violence.</p> <p>All those subject to domestic orders have been sent a letter from the NCIS informing them that if they travel to the low countries there is every chance they will be turned back. Those subject to international orders will have to surrender their passports or report on a daily basis at a police station from today.</p> <p>Bryan Drew, head of the NCIS, emphasised that Dutch and Belgian police were determined to arrest, charge and convict those involved in violence. He said that on returning to England those hooligans convicted would be arrested again and banned from football grounds for at least 10 years.</p> <p>International banning orders can only be imposed on hooligans if they have been convicted in a foreign court. There was dismay within the NCIS and the Home Office last month when hooligans in violent clashes between Arsenal and Galatasary supporters before the Uefa Cup final in Copenhagen were deported without charge by Danish authorities.</p> <p>The Belgian justice ministry yesterday announced that 150 prisoners are to be released for the duration of the tournament to make room for hooligans in the country's overcrowded prisons. Though the scheme is voluntary, sex offenders, lifers and convicts in the process of being charged for other offences were not allowed to apply.</p> <p>Further space is to be created by delaying the sentencing of non-dangerous criminals until after the tournament. Belgium's prisons can hold a maximum of 8,500 people and are already full. Police garages in Charleroi have already been converted into makeshift cells.</p> <p>\"Anyone who is arrested under the fast-track procedure can be detained for five days before appearing in front of a judge. Granting prison leave will allow us to keep suspects locked up effectively,\" a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>The Dutch authorities are also willing to release inmates coming to the end of their sentences for the same reasons.</p> <p><b>Links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.fifa.com\" target=\"_NEW\">FIFA</a><br><a href=\"http://www.euro2000.org\" target=\"_NEW\">European championships</a></p>",

The action by Dutch border authorities was welcomed by Jack Straw, the home secretary, as the first success of a joint intelligence effort by British, Dutch, Belgian and French police designed to avoid outbreaks of violent disorder at the three-week tournament. The two men are among more than 1,000 known or suspected hooligans whose names have been passed to Dutch, Belgian and French authorities by the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). The 1998 World Cup in France was marred by riots involving English fans in Marseille and Lens, and recent violence involving supporters of Arsenal and Leeds and the Turkish club Galatasaray has heightened tension. Anticipating familiar scenes, particularly at England's match with Germany in Charleroi a week on Saturday, the Home Office and the NCIS have been keen to demonstrate this week that they have done everything within their power to prevent hooligans reaching Euro 2000. Yesterday, however, Mr Straw was criticised by the chief executive of the European football association (Uefa), Gerhard Aigner, for failing to pass legislation allowing the courts to remove the passports of known hooligans. Confirming that the England-Germany match will go ahead in Charleroi despite misgivings about safety inside the 30,000-capacity stadium and crowd control around it, Mr Aigner said: \"It is regrettable that the government in the United Kingdom has not introduced legislation which would make it possible to stop registered hooligans from travelling.\" This week Mr Straw blamed \"maverick Tories and a pusillanimous Conservative front bench\" for blocking the legislation when it was introduced last year. It was not reintroduced prior to Euro 2000 because the legislative time was not available, he said. Mr Aigner defended the decision to stage the England-Germany game in Charleroi, claiming its suitability as a venue was not questioned until it was too late. \"Over the last three years, both Uefa and the organisers, together with the authorities in both host countries, have carefully prepared the event,\" he said. \"At no time did the authorities make any reservations with regard to the use of the stadiums, including the one in Charleroi, for the matches to be played there.\" Reacting to Mr Aigner's criticism, Mr Straw said the NCIS had launched the most extensive and sophisticated operation ever for a big overseas tournament. Officers from 19 regional police forces have been seconded to the football unit and will work closely with spotters on the ground in Belgium and Holland to monitor the movement of English hooligans. The unit has identified 99 people against whom there are international banning orders, 416 subject to domestic banning orders and hundreds with no football-related convictions but suspected of being involved in related violence. All those subject to domestic orders have been sent a letter from the NCIS informing them that if they travel to the low countries there is every chance they will be turned back. Those subject to international orders will have to surrender their passports or report on a daily basis at a police station from today. Bryan Drew, head of the NCIS, emphasised that Dutch and Belgian police were determined to arrest, charge and convict those involved in violence. He said that on returning to England those hooligans convicted would be arrested again and banned from football grounds for at least 10 years. International banning orders can only be imposed on hooligans if they have been convicted in a foreign court. There was dismay within the NCIS and the Home Office last month when hooligans in violent clashes between Arsenal and Galatasary supporters before the Uefa Cup final in Copenhagen were deported without charge by Danish authorities. The Belgian justice ministry yesterday announced that 150 prisoners are to be released for the duration of the tournament to make room for hooligans in the country's overcrowded prisons. Though the scheme is voluntary, sex offenders, lifers and convicts in the process of being charged for other offences were not allowed to apply. Further space is to be created by delaying the sentencing of non-dangerous criminals until after the tournament. Belgium's prisons can hold a maximum of 8,500 people and are already full. Police garages in Charleroi have already been converted into makeshift cells. \"Anyone who is arrested under the fast-track procedure can be detained for five days before appearing in front of a judge. Granting prison leave will allow us to keep suspects locked up effectively,\" a spokeswoman said. The Dutch authorities are also willing to release inmates coming to the end of their sentences for the same reasons. Links FIFA European championships",

Last year the law commission indicated that it favoured amending the rule in exceptional cases. The home secretary, Jack Straw, is expected to endorse this suggestion when the commission's full recommendations are published early next year. Today's report by the Labour-dominated committee advises that the new rules should apply to past cases, which could allow for a second prosecution of the Lawrence suspects. There are currently 35 cases where the police investigation has been closed because the offenders have been acquitted, the National Crime Faculty told MPs. Three suspects in the Stephen Lawrence case, Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson, were cleared of the black teenager's murder after the collapse of the family's private prosecution and cannot be retried under existing legislation. The double jeopardy rule also prevents M25 road rage killer Kenneth Noye being retried for killing Detective John Fordham in 1985. A jury accepted the stabbing was in self-defence after Noye found the policeman in his garden. The committee, chaired by Labour MP Robin Corbett, said that changes were needed in the interests of justice for victims and their families, because the current legislation meant that wrongful convictions could be quashed but not wrongful acquittals. Scientific advances, particularly in DNA testing, mean strong evidence can be uncovered long after an initial acquittal, leaving victims feeling cheated. The committee recommended the removal of double jeopardy in cases such as manslaughter, rape, grievous bodily harm, robbery, aggravated burglary, arson and supplying class A drugs as well as murder. Limiting the principle, part of English law since the 12th century, is widely opposed by legal and civil rights groups. The committee said its proposals should be debated by MPs, with the law commission's findings, as soon as possible after those conclusions have been produced.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>What was the ruling?</b> <br>In April Judge Jackson found Microsoft guilty of breaking America's anti-monopoly laws, enshrined in the 1890 Sherman Act, which prohibits powerful companies from using their dominance to damage the competition and limit customer choice. Yesterday, he agreed with the government that Microsoft should be broken in two. One company will own the Windows operating system, the other will own applications such as Word and Office. <p><b>Why did Judge Jackson think Microsoft should be split up?</b><br> He said Microsoft was unwilling to to accept the notion that it had broken the law and had refused to comply with a court order to change its behaviour. Microsoft is defiant, accusing the judge and the government of making an \"unwarranted and unjustifiable intrusion in the software marketplace\". Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder, suggested that the judge had failed to understand the dynamics of the industry. Microsoft refuses to concede that it is a monopoly despite its overwhelming dominance of operating systems - the brains of the computer.</p> <p><b>What will Microsoft do now?</b><br> Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said Microsoft would appeal not only against the breakup decision but also against the restraints on its behaviour that the judge imposed while the substantive issue is being resolved. The case is expected to go all the way to the supreme court. Microsoft will try to drag this out as long as possible in the hope that the next administration - possibly led by Republican George W Bush - will put pressure on the US justice department to drop the case.</p> <p><b>What does the decision mean for consumers?</b><br> In the short run, there should be little change. Microsoft controls 90% of the market for operating systems and it will take years for other companies to break this stranglehold, even if the company is split up. In the long run, Microsoft's breakup should stimulate innovation so there will be more choice. </p> <p><b>How did Microsoft abuse its power?</b><br> Judge Jackson said the company had used its monopoly of operating systems to stifle competition in the internet browser market.

      "bodyText": "What was the ruling? In April Judge Jackson found Microsoft guilty of breaking America's anti-monopoly laws, enshrined in the 1890 Sherman Act, which prohibits powerful companies from using their dominance to damage the competition and limit customer choice. Yesterday, he agreed with the government that Microsoft should be broken in two. One company will own the Windows operating system, the other will own applications such as Word and Office. Why did Judge Jackson think Microsoft should be split up? He said Microsoft was unwilling to to accept the notion that it had broken the law and had refused to comply with a court order to change its behaviour. Microsoft is defiant, accusing the judge and the government of making an \"unwarranted and unjustifiable intrusion in the software marketplace\". Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder, suggested that the judge had failed to understand the dynamics of the industry. Microsoft refuses to concede that it is a monopoly despite its overwhelming dominance of operating systems - the brains of the computer. What will Microsoft do now? Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said Microsoft would appeal not only against the breakup decision but also against the restraints on its behaviour that the judge imposed while the substantive issue is being resolved. The case is expected to go all the way to the supreme court. Microsoft will try to drag this out as long as possible in the hope that the next administration - possibly led by Republican George W Bush - will put pressure on the US justice department to drop the case. What does the decision mean for consumers? In the short run, there should be little change. Microsoft controls 90% of the market for operating systems and it will take years for other companies to break this stranglehold, even if the company is split up. In the long run, Microsoft's breakup should stimulate innovation so there will be more choice. How did Microsoft abuse its power? Judge Jackson said the company had used its monopoly of operating systems to stifle competition in the internet browser market. He agreed with the US government and the 17 states that brought this case that Microsoft illegally bundled its Internet Explorer browser with Windows, in an attempt to crush its main internet browser rival at the time, Netscape. Judge Jackson said: \"Microsoft placed an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune, thereby effectively guaranteeing its continued dominance in the relevant market.\" Will the decision really harm Microsoft? On past experience, a breakup should benefit the smaller parts of Microsoft. In the last big breakup, when the AT&amp;T phone giant was broken up in the 1980s, a slimmer AT&amp;T subsequently emerged as a stronger company. That decision also galvanised the whole US telecommunications industry, leading to cheaper rates for consumers. In the short term though, Microsoft can expect to take another hit on its share price.

      "body": "<p>In the beginning, as with all sagas, it was simple, like the E flat that begins the Ring of the Nibelung. There was a genius, Richard Wagner, who built a theatre at Bayreuth to perform his music dramas in conditions of his own choosing. Then the genius died, so his wife Cosima took over the theatre, before handing it over to their son Siegfried, who died in turn, passing the theatre on to his own wife, Winifred. </p> <p>Then things got very nasty, as happens in all sagas. Winifred Wagner, though born in Hastings, was a German nationalist, a Nazi, an anti-Semite and, to the day of her death in 1980, an admirer of Adolf Hitler. Hitler in turn loved Wagner's operas, and perhaps Winifred too. Bayreuth became a Nazi shrine and the Wagner legacy became forever intertwined with that of the Third Reich. </p> <p>The other complication is that families expand as time goes on, and the Wagner family is no exception. Siegfried and Winifred Wagner had four children, two of whom, Wieland and Wolfgang, reopened the denazified Bayreuth festival in 1951. Wieland, the eldest and most talented of his generation of Wagners, died prematurely and greatly mourned in 1966. Wolfgang, now 80, remains in charge at Bayreuth to this day. </p> <p>Wolfgang's immediate problem, much reported over the past week, is that there are 12 Wagners in the next generation. Even if they all saw eye to eye about the future of Bayreuth, which they do not, the succession decision has become more complex as the moment nears when a fourth generation takes over the theatre in which Richard Wagner mounted the premiere of the Ring back in 1876. </p> <p>The battle for the succession is partly about soap opera. Will Wolfgang get his wish and pass Bayreuth on to his second wife, Gudrun, 56, and ultimately their 22-year-old daughter, Katharina? Or will the children of Wolfgang's first marriage, Eva and Gottfried, win the prize? What about Wieland's four children, especially Wolf-Siegfried and his sister Nike? </p> <p>But this battle is not just about soap opera but about real opera too. It is about the priorities and values of 21st-century Bayreuth. It is about whether the Bayreuth that Wolfgang will ultimately relinquish will remain the Bayreuth that he inherited, a festival dedicated to the annual re-creation of his grandfather's 10 mature stage works - and nothing else. </p> <p>This summer, as every summer since 1951, Bayreuth will present a group of Wagner's works. The centrepiece will be a new staging of the Ring directed by J\u00fcrgen Flimm and conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli. In addition, there will be a revival of Keith Warner's production of Lohengrin and revivals of two of Wolfgang's own productions, Die Meistersinger and Parsifal, the latter the work most indissolubly associated with Bayreuth. </p> <p>Bayreuth and conservatism are words that fall naturally together, but the association is by no means the whole story. Unquestionably, Bayreuth is a place of traditions - the Wagner family, the Wagner repertoire, the musical excellence, the high seriousness, the performance and audience rituals, the uncomfortable seats - and it has always attracted Germany's richest and most powerful elite, who make up the bulk of the audience for the 30 or so performances, which start in late July and continue through August. Unquestionably too, Wolfgang Wagner is a political and cultural conservative. </p> <p>He has spent his whole life in Bayreuth, dedicated to the perpetuation of the family festival. His first memory of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus is of a Gotterdammerung dress rehearsal as long ago as 1925. He was dangled on Cosima Wagner's knee, embraced and photographed with \"Uncle Wolf\" Hitler, was present in the town when his grandfather's historic home at Wahnfried was bombed by the Allies in 1945, and has been a highly visible and energetic presence at all 50 of the postwar festivals. </p> <p>Wolfgang's own productions at Bayreuth have never had the radicalism, vision or acclaim of his elder brother Wieland's. Wolfgang's productions have been generally derivative of Wieland's \"New Bayreuth\" style, though some have seen touches of Albert Speer in his Parsifal designs. Where Wieland's Meistersinger was touched with menace, Wolfgang's exuded reconciliation and bonhomie, which struck many radical critics as culpably naive. </p> <p>No one who reads the devastating book Twilight of the Wagners by his estranged son Gottfried can be in much doubt either about Wolfgang's conservative politics, his anti- liberalism and anti-communism, and his long habit of ducking and concealing the full truth of the Nazi era. </p> <p>\"Hitler cured unemployment and restored worldwide respect for the German economy. He freed our people from a moral crisis and united all decent forces. We Wagners have him to thank for the idealistic rescue of the Bayreuth festival,\" Gottfried reports his father telling him in the 50s. His treatment of the Jews \"was the only real mistake Hitler made\". </p> <p>Yet Wolfgang has certainly adapted with the times, even managed to reinvent himself in some ways. His decision to open Bayreuth to outside directors in 1969 was both inescapable and revolutionary. While his own productions have not been innovative, he has consistently encouraged a series of ever more radical re-evaluations of Wagner's operas by others, beginning with G\u00f6tz Friedrich's 1971 Tannh\u00e4user and Patrice Chereau's 1976 centenary Ring and continuing up to the present day. These have routinely outraged the conservatives. He, more than anyone, has internationalised Bayreuth, bringing in French, British, Italian, American and Israeli conductors. In the past two decades, most of the criticism of Bayreuth has been that it has been too left-wing, not too right-wing. </p> <p>What Wolfgang has not done is respond to the challenges posed by the two most radical Wagners of the next generation. His son Gottfried and his niece Nike both focus their hostility on the terms of the Richard Wagner Foundation of Bayreuth, which runs the festival on terms drafted by Wolfgang in 1973. Under its charter, Bayreuth is run by a 24-person council representing the Wagners, the German and Bavarian governments, the city of Bayreuth and the local authorities of Franconia. But the foundation's aims are restricted to the preservation of \"the artistic legacy of Richard Wagner in perpetuity\". The Festspielhaus is to be used \"solely for the solemn performance of the works of Richard Wagner\". </p> <p>\"To focus the festival solely on Richard Wagner precludes any end to the Wagner cult, the horrifying consequences of which have already been shown,\" Gottfried Wagner says. Instead, he proposes that Wagner's early works before the Flying Dutchman, none of which is ever performed at Bayreuth, should all be performed in the festival. So, he says, should the works of composers who had a major influence on Wagner, such as Weber and Marschner, and perhaps even Mozart. The Bayreuth festival should be a much more open event, encouraging other art forms, and should constantly re-examine all aspects of Wagner's legacy, including his political and cultural influence. </p> <p>In her manifesto published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last month, Nike Wagner made several of the same points as her cousin. She also suggested that Bayreuth should itself commission new works. \"The festival risks becoming repetitive,\" Nike wrote. \"It is always resorting to its old-fashioned roots.\" </p> <p>Nike and Gottfried Wagner are surely right. Bayreuth clearly needs to heed once again Richard Wagner's famous injunction to always do something new. But it also needs to remember Hans Sach's warning not to despise the best of its own traditions.</p>",

It came as a relief to the home side, who had been playing catch-up after Inzamam-ul-Haq's masterly century put Pakistan in charge. The early signs had been good for West Indies as Pakistan lost five for 39 in the first 17 overs as Ambrose and Walsh quickly warmed to their task. But Inzamam - who had hit 86 and 138 in his previous Test, against Sri Lanka - again showed his class with a broad selection of shots in his 117. He fell early on the second morning - lbw to Reon King's first ball of the day - after putting on a priceless 206 in 84 overs with Abdur Razzaq. Next morning was slow going and the innings subsided after Abdur Razzaq fell 13 runs short of a maiden Test hundred. In reply, West Indies, boasting eight left-handers, stumbled to 139 for six, then Shivnarine Chanderpaul proved the model of dogged defiance, cautiously compiling an unbeaten 46 in just over four hours. Nixon McLean matched Chanderpaul's score in almost half the time as the pair put on 74, before McLean tickled a Waqar Younis delivery to first slip. But, as West Indies crept closer to Pakistan's benchmark, the heavens opened. Terminally.<br><strong>Wisden verdict</strong> Chanderpaul's runs marked another step in the Windies' rehabilitation, but the way they allowed a huge partnership to build up between two collapses showed that the bowling is still not what it was.</p> <p><strong>2nd Test, Bridgetown, May 18-22</strong> <br> <strong>Drawn</strong><br> <strong>Pakistan</strong> 253 (Yousuf Youhana 115, Walsh 5-22) and 419 for 9 decl.

After winning the toss, Pakistan had slumped to 37 for 5 before Yousuf Youhana's second Test century took them to respectability. Courtney Walsh seized the opportunity to top up on his world record with his 18th five-wicket haul in Tests. Sherwin Campbell and Wavell Hinds then added 133 for the second wicket, and Hinds, in his fourth Test, went on to a superbly aggressive maiden hundred, striking 24 fours and a six in his 165. Another newcomer, debutant Ramnaresh Sarwan stroked 84*. Trailing by 146, Pakistan fought their way back into the game with a first-wicket stand of 219, as Imran Nazir became the second player in the game to hit his maiden Test ton, but again West Indies fought back to leave themselves an unlikely victory target of 275 in 54 overs. With one game to go, it was all-square. <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> Forget Brian Lara (for the moment). West Indies now have two new left-handers to bolster an ailing line-up. Look out for Hinds and Sarwan in England. </p> <p><strong>3rd Test, Antigua, May 25-29</strong> <br> <strong>West Indies won by 1 wicket</strong><br> <strong>Pakistan</strong> 269 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 55, Yousuf Youhana 103*, Walsh 5-83) and 219 (Inzamam-ul-Haq 68, King 4-48)<br> <strong>West Indies</strong> 273 (Chanderpaul 89, Adams 60, Wasim Akram 6-61) and 216 for 9 (Hinds 63, Wasim Akram 5-49)<br> <strong>Toss</strong> West Indies <strong>Debuts</strong> none<br> This had to be seen to be believed. West Indies needed 216 to avoid their first series defeat at home to Pakistan, and, with Wavell Hinds playing another classy innings, were cruising at 144 for 3. But Hinds was bowled by Wasim Akram, and West Indies panicked, losing five more wickets as they crept to 197 for 9. Courtney Walsh, the world's worst batsman, joined his captain and fellow Jamaican Jimmy Adams at the crease. Nineteen were needed. What followed were scenes of pandemonium rarely seen in a Test match. First Adams appeared to nick Wasim to Moin Khan behind the stumps, but with the Pakistanis already celebrating, home umpire Billy Doctrove ruled not out. Then Walsh squeezed Saqlain Mushtaq onto his pads and was comfortably held at short leg. To the Pakistanis' astonishment, New Zealander Doug Cowie refused to raise the finger. Finally, and most excruciatingly of all, Walsh and Adams found themselves at the same end after Adams had trotted quietly (too quietly) through for a leg-bye. But Saqlain, attempting to execute the easiest of run outs at the other end, dropped the ball, and Walsh gallopped home to safety. Soon after, Adams took two to midwicket to level the scores, grinned from ear to ear, then played and missed at Wasim next ball, before dropping a short single the delivery after and sparking wild scenes of jubilation (not to say relief). The pair had added 19 runs in 13.1 overs, while Adams had eaten up 212 balls for his 48*. He didn't score more than two off any ball. It was all so harsh on man of the match Wasim, who finished with 11 wickets days after being implicated in the match-fixing scandal by the Qayyum report. Earlier, Yousuf Youhana had made a second consecutive hundred and Inzamam-ul-Haq had hit two typically beefy fifties. But the Gods were smiling on the other side. West Indies' 1-0 series win meant they stayed third in the Wisden World Championship; defeat would have pushed them down to fifth. <strong>Wisden verdict </strong>Undeserved? Maybe. Lucky? Probably. Vital? Definitely. Jimmy Adams is now unbeaten in five Tests as captain, while two of his three wins have been a case of back from the dead. He could be just the man West Indies need to kickstart the renaissance.</p> <p><strong>West Indies v Zimbabwe </strong> </p> <p><strong>First Test, Port-of-Spain, Mar 16-20 </strong> <br> <strong>West Indies won by 35 runs </strong> <br> <strong>West Indies</strong> 187 (Streak 4-45) and 147 (Streak 5-23) <br> <strong>Zimbabwe</strong> 236 (Andy Flower 113*, Ambrose 4-42) and 63 (Rose 4-19) <br> <strong>Toss</strong> Zimbabwe <strong>Debuts</strong> Gayle, Hinds (West Indies), Murphy (Zimbabwe) </p> <p>West Indies' bowlers have saved face in the fourth innings before. But it's unlikely that they've ever done so under as much pressure - and as spectacularly - as here. Defending 99 to avoid defeat and further scorn in their inaugural meeting with Zimbabwe, Curtly and Co bowled with unremitting accuracy on a pitch that, even by Trinidad's standards, was doing a bit. A shellshocked Zimbabwe were shot out for 63 - their lowest total, and the first time a side had failed to chase a double-figure score in a Test since 1882. Jimmy Adams, leading West Indies for the first time after Brian Lara's self-imposed exile, was jubilant.Earlier, Heath Streak and Andy Flower seemed to have put Zimbabwe on course for their fourth Test win. Streak made the most of a damp, uneven wicket to take nine for 68, while Flower, fortunate to survive an appeal for caught behind before he had scored, moved to his seventh Test hundred. He was the only man in the match to pass fifty. But with the crowd turning against them and their biggest humbling yet on the cards, the West Indies rose from the dead: Franklyn Rose took four in quick succession and Ambrose (age 36, bowling figures 11-6-8-3) cleared up amid dramatic scenes and under dark skies.<br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> The Windies may be in decline. But they can still roll back the years when it matters - especially in the Caribbean.</p> <p><strong>Second Test, Kingston, Mar 24-28 </strong> <br> <strong>West Indies won by 10 wickets </strong><br> <strong>Zimbabwe</strong> 308 (Goodwin 113, Andy Flower 66, King 5-51) and 102 <br> <strong>West Indies</strong> 339 (Adams 101*, Rose 69) and 75 for 0 (Griffith 54*) <br> <strong>Toss</strong> Zimbabwe <strong>Debuts</strong> none </p> <p>One for the romantics. In front of his adoring home crowd, and with one Zimbabwean wicket still to fall, Courtney Walsh stood level at the top of the world with Kapil Dev on 434 Test wickets. The last man was Henry Olonga, one of the world's most celebrated rabbits, and when Walsh lifted one into his ribs, Olonga steered it into the hands of Wavell Hinds at short leg - and the celebrations began. The fact that West Indies had won a Test match, a series and moved back into third place in the Wisden World Championship was largely forgotten. A Windies victory had looked unlikely after Murray Goodwin and Andy Flower, with a fourth-wicket stand of 176, had lifted Zimbabwe to a first-innings total of 308. And when West Indies stuttered to 170 for 7 in reply, a drawn series was on the cards. But Jimmy Adams hit his first Test century for four years and was kept company by Franklyn Rose, who made contact with enough speculative swishes to hit a career-best 69 and help add 148 for the eighth wicket. Zimbabwe never recovered, and with Heath Streak unable to bat because of an injury, slumped to 102 all out. Left 72 to win, the usually sedate Adrian Griffith (0, 0 and 6 in the series so far) thundered an unbeaten 54 off just 41 balls. In the end it was too easy. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> Walsh's feat akin to Geoff Boycott scoring his 100th hundred in front of his Headingley acolytes - but better. And Adams could just be the captain to lead West Indies out of the doldrums. </p> <p> <strong>New Zealand v Australia </strong> </p> <p><strong>First Test, Auckland, Mar 11-15</strong> <br> <strong>Australia won by 62 runs </strong><br> <strong>Australia</strong> 214 (Mark Waugh 72*, Vettori 5-62) and 229 (Gilchrist 59, Vettori 7-87) <br> <strong>New Zealand</strong> 163 (McGrath 4-33) and 218 (McMillan 78, Miller 5-55) <br> <strong>Toss</strong> Australia <strong>Debuts</strong> none </p> <p>There aren't many bowlers who are outperformed by their opposite number and still steal the headlines. But Shane Warne is no ordinary bowler. When he claimed Paul Wiseman caught behind in the second innings (\"As soon as I saw him sweep I was appealing\") he at last passed Dennis Lillee's Australian Test record of 355 wickets - and a nation celebrated. Almost incidentally, it gave Australia their eighth Test win in a row, equalling the record set by their 1920-21 compatriots. And it meant that the feats of New Zealand's slow left-armer Daniel Vettori were virtually forgotten. He returned a career-best match analysis of 12-149 (Warne took 5-148); only Richard Hadlee (15-123 v Australia, at Brisbane in 1985-86) has done better for the Kiwis. Vettori also became the third youngest bowler, at 21 years and 46 days, to reach 100 Test wickets, behind Kapil Dev and Waqar Younis. But on a turning wicket, the crucial innings was played by Adam Gilchrist, now firmly established as the world's best wicketkeeper-batsman: he hit 59 in Australia's second innings to leave New Zealand a victory target of 281. After the fourth day was lost to rain, they began the fifth on 151 for 5, but Chris Cairns went immediately, and Craig McMillan was left to fight a lone battle, as Colin Miller returned career-best figures. But for once, one individual was bigger than the game. <br> <strong>Wisden verdict</strong> The Aussies haven't been this inconvenienced since Murali had them in trouble in Sri Lanka in August.</p> <p><strong>Second Test, Wellington, Mar 24-27</strong> <br> <strong>Australia won by six wickets</strong><br> <strong>New Zealand</strong> 298 (Astle 61, Cairns 109, Warne 4-68) and 294 (Fleming 60, Cairns 69)<br> <strong>Australia</strong> 419 (Slater 143, Steve Waugh 151*, Martyn 78) and 177 for 4 (Langer 57)<br> <strong>Toss</strong> New Zealand <strong>Debuts</strong> none </p> <p>Australia moved inevitably to a ninth Test win in a row - a new national record - and captain Steve Waugh became the first man to pass 150 against all the other eight Test teams. But this game will be remembered for the batting of Chris Cairns. Coming in at 66 for 5 on the first day he took a high-class century - his third in Tests - off a high-class attack to lift New Zealand to 298. Then, with NZ five down in their second innings and still 33 runs in arrears, Cairns did what his father Lance used to do, and hit one six after another: three off Shane Warne (including two in an over), two off Brett Lee (including a law-of-physics-defying back-foot drive over the sightscreen) and one off Greg Blewett. He made 'only' 69, in 83 balls, but he had given his side a chance - and reminded the rest of the world that these Aussies could be rattled. In between, Michael Slater (with his 14th Test hundred) and Steve Waugh (with his 22nd) rescued Australia from 51 for 4, adding 199 for the fifth wicket, before Damien Martyn made the most of Ricky Ponting's injury-enforced absence with a blistering 78. Set 174 to win the series after Cairns's fireworks, Australia lost Blewett early, but Justin Langer settled in and Australia had won again. It extended their lead at the top of the Wisden World Championship to 0.14 over South Africa.

It came as a relief to the home side, who had been playing catch-up after Inzamam-ul-Haq's masterly century put Pakistan in charge. The early signs had been good for West Indies as Pakistan lost five for 39 in the first 17 overs as Ambrose and Walsh quickly warmed to their task. But Inzamam - who had hit 86 and 138 in his previous Test, against Sri Lanka - again showed his class with a broad selection of shots in his 117. He fell early on the second morning - lbw to Reon King's first ball of the day - after putting on a priceless 206 in 84 overs with Abdur Razzaq. Next morning was slow going and the innings subsided after Abdur Razzaq fell 13 runs short of a maiden Test hundred. In reply, West Indies, boasting eight left-handers, stumbled to 139 for six, then Shivnarine Chanderpaul proved the model of dogged defiance, cautiously compiling an unbeaten 46 in just over four hours. Nixon McLean matched Chanderpaul's score in almost half the time as the pair put on 74, before McLean tickled a Waqar Younis delivery to first slip. But, as West Indies crept closer to Pakistan's benchmark, the heavens opened. Terminally. Wisden verdict Chanderpaul's runs marked another step in the Windies' rehabilitation, but the way they allowed a huge partnership to build up between two collapses showed that the bowling is still not what it was. 2nd Test, Bridgetown, May 18-22 Drawn Pakistan 253 (Yousuf Youhana 115, Walsh 5-22) and 419 for 9 decl.

After winning the toss, Pakistan had slumped to 37 for 5 before Yousuf Youhana's second Test century took them to respectability. Courtney Walsh seized the opportunity to top up on his world record with his 18th five-wicket haul in Tests. Sherwin Campbell and Wavell Hinds then added 133 for the second wicket, and Hinds, in his fourth Test, went on to a superbly aggressive maiden hundred, striking 24 fours and a six in his 165.

They would do well to rethink their stance, before the public starts to wonder whether they are not still more interested in protecting themselves than protecting patients.",

The group calls itself Revolutionary Organisation November 17. It takes its name from a student-led uprising against the then military dictatorship on that date in 1973. November 17 takes a low-key approach, shunning publicity and striking only infrequently - but with deadly effect. Not a single member has ever been arrested. Its victims include a CIA station chief in Athens and three other Americans. Brigadier Saunders could have been targeted simply because Britain is a staunch ally of the USA, especially in counter-terrorist strategy. A more specific reason could be the role that Britain played in last year's dramatic abduction of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. Ocalan was smuggled through Greece to a supposed safe haven in Kenya, by Greek diplomats and other officials keen to embarrass Turkey. Their ploy misfired when Turkish special forces snatched the rebel leader and flew him back to Turkey to face trial. He is now under sentence of death. Following the dramatic kidnap, November 17 issued one of its rare communiques, blaming the Greek government for Ocalan's arrest. Like most Greek factions, whether right or left, November 17 holds passionately anti-Turkish views, and has pledged its support to Ocalan's PKK militant group. The Greek cell was undoubtedly angered when, following the Ocalan abduction, 79 supporters of the Kurdish leader were arrested during rowdy demonstrations in London. Britain also suspended and later revoked the broadcast licence of Med-TV, a Kurdish satellite TV station with links to the PKK. November 17 has also been stirred to violent action by recent events in the Balkans, which have led to a surge of anti-US and anti-Nato feeling in Greece. According to the US authorities, there were 40 attacks on Western interests in just three months last year, including seven rocket attacks and bombings attributed to November 17.

The command centre, at the headquarters of the Netherlands national police agency in Dribergen, near Utrecht, uses the latest technology and information available on all known and suspected hooligans from the 16 countries taking part. Officers began working on a detailed computer system three years ago. It allows every police station in Holland and Belgium to access the names of all troublemakers, to run checks on fans suspected of taking part in football violence in their own countries, and obtain a detailed profile of large groups of fans, where they will be staying and how they will be travelling. The central computer system will also allow police resources to be diverted to areas where there is likely to be serious trouble. The 35,000 police officers on duty in Holland and 25,000 in Belgium will be able to feed new information and names into the computer. Foreign police forces are also able to gain access to the computer system and feed the latest information into it. If, for example, a group of Germans are staying at a campsite, the details will be entered into the computer and police spotters in plain clothes, who track the movements of hooligans, will be alerted via computer and sent to compile a risk assessment of the fans. All supporters travelling to Euro 2000 are being categorised according to their willingness to take part in violence. Fans who avoid violence have been categorised as A, those who take part in violence category B, while those who start and organise it have been categorised as C. The central computer has already compiled a risk assessment of all fans who have pre-booked their accommodation. The system, known as Fimes (Football intelligence message exchange system), played a crucial role in ensuring that two English hooligans did not make it into Holland. When one arrived at the Hook of Holland, his passport was scanned and a computer at the border control showed that his name appeared on a list of known hooligans. As a secondary measure the name was also fed into the computer in Dribergen. Officers at the central command immediately sent a message back via computer, warning border control officials that the person should not be allowed into the country. The hooligan at Amsterdam airport was turned back using the same system. Chief superintendent Wim van Oorschot, who has been working in the bi-national intelligence centre, said: \"You could say that we have had our first success but there is still a lot of work to be done. We are working very closely with police forces all around Europe and with the border police. \"A lot of work has gone into Fimes and the overall security arrangements.

You cannot have a tournament of this size and not expect any problems.\" The intelligence centre is the largest and most sophisticated set up for a football tournament and up to 80 officers, including those from the 16 countries taking part, will be working in it 24 hours per day once the tournament starts. Dutch authorities have already re-introduced border controls and have warned that any fans causing trouble will be prosecuted and forced to serve prison sentences before being allowed to return home.

All our best friends are there. Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, which was mopped up by ntl last week, makes fourth place with 0.54 complaints per 10,000 customers reaching Oftel in the six months since October (the figures don't include complaints made directly to the companies). In third place is Cellular Operations and its trading partner 1st Line, with 5.69 complaints per 10,000. Second, with 192.4, came Next Call. And top for the second time is LocalTel (now part of World Online), which has managed an eye-catching 321.6 complaints per 10,000. Chief among them is the difficulty in contacting its call centres and total inaction should the customer succeed. </p> <p>This sounds familiar to Alan Grahame of London, a LocalTel customer whose phone suddenly stopped working shortly after his son was put in intensive care. He spent three hours trying to contact LocalTel's customer services and a further 25 minutes being passed around its phone network before someone agreed to act. Afterwards, Grahame was promised a conciliatory call from a senior official but has heard nothing. </p> <p>LocalTel's somewhat leisurely approach to communications appears to have improved little, despite the fact that their free phone number has switched to local call rates. \"Their complicated menu system takes up to five minutes to inform you that all its operators are busy,\" says Grahame. \"As LocalTel gets a cut of the call price that makes a nice little earner.\" </p> <p><strong> \u0095Consumer contacted LocalTel's press officer five weeks ago for a comment but has heard nothing to date, despite two reminder messages. The interesting question is, what does the regulator, which has already admonished LocalTel for its tardy responses, propose to do about under-performing companies? The answer is very little other than post up bulletins about their misdemeanour. \"We speak to them on an informal basis about problems, but their licences are not dependent on standards of service because competition is the best regulator,\" says a spokeswoman. \"It's not for the government to try to run commercial companies; we want consumers to vote with their feet.\"</strong> </p> <p><strong> Gas goof</strong><br> </p> <p>Those who have escaped a head-on with their phone company might find themselves enduring a practice run courtesy of the gas giants. As with telecoms, the privatised industry has led to some exotic interpretations of customer service. For 19 months Keith Taylor of Southampton has been receiving increasingly threatening demands from Scottish Power, culminating in a letter from its solicitors claiming unpaid electricity bills. The difficulty is that Taylor has never been a customer of the company, but phone calls and letters have failed to convince it of the fact. In desperation Taylor contacted the gas watchdog Ofgem and the result was another bill, this time for a non-existent gas account. </p> <p><strong> \u0095\"They've gone and signed up the wrong chap by keying in the wrong postcode,\" says a weary spokesman from Scottish Power. \"Mr Taylor was transferred to us and by the time we cottoned on to the fact, he was legally a customer. We have made a poor show of it and the matter has been resolved.\"</strong> </p> <p><strong> Lack of energy</strong><br> </p> <p> David Parker of Redhill in Surrey is, in contrast, longing to be billed by Independent Energy. He signed up in June last year and has yet to hear a peep, despite several imploring letters and phone calls. </p> <p><strong> \u0095Independent Energy blames computer problems that messed up its billing system. They are, it says soothingly, \"close to being resolved\". Parker will soon get his bill and an unpleasant shock it will be with a year-long debt to settle. \"But there's no way that we'll make him pay at once,\" says a spokesman. \"We're prepared to take an understanding approach.\"</strong> </p> <p><strong> Oops, wrong account</strong><br> </p> <p> Georgia and Phil Bailey are also facing a crippling debt through no fault of their own. The latter arranged for \u00a3350 of household money to be transferred from his account at the Halifax to Georgia's account at Lloyds each month, but first time round the Halifax paid it into the wrong account. It re-credited Phil promptly, then re-credited him a second time and only demanded it back when the Baileys had unwittingly spent it. \"They've finally agreed to let us repay it at \u00a325 a month which, as our budget is so tight, means we'll exceed our overdraft limit with each payment,\" says Bailey. \"The Halifax has refused to increase our limit which means we'll go further into the red every month.\" </p> <p><strong> \u0095Consumer massages the bank's conscience and the result is a fulsome apology for its inefficiency and the promise of a doubled overdraft to ease the payments.</strong> </p> <p>Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",

For 19 months Keith Taylor of Southampton has been receiving increasingly threatening demands from Scottish Power, culminating in a letter from its solicitors claiming unpaid electricity bills. The difficulty is that Taylor has never been a customer of the company, but phone calls and letters have failed to convince it of the fact. In desperation Taylor contacted the gas watchdog Ofgem and the result was another bill, this time for a non-existent gas account. \u0095\"They've gone and signed up the wrong chap by keying in the wrong postcode,\" says a weary spokesman from Scottish Power. \"Mr Taylor was transferred to us and by the time we cottoned on to the fact, he was legally a customer. We have made a poor show of it and the matter has been resolved.\" Lack of energy David Parker of Redhill in Surrey is, in contrast, longing to be billed by Independent Energy. He signed up in June last year and has yet to hear a peep, despite several imploring letters and phone calls. \u0095Independent Energy blames computer problems that messed up its billing system. They are, it says soothingly, \"close to being resolved\". Parker will soon get his bill and an unpleasant shock it will be with a year-long debt to settle. \"But there's no way that we'll make him pay at once,\" says a spokesman. \"We're prepared to take an understanding approach.\" Oops, wrong account Georgia and Phil Bailey are also facing a crippling debt through no fault of their own. The latter arranged for \u00a3350 of household money to be transferred from his account at the Halifax to Georgia's account at Lloyds each month, but first time round the Halifax paid it into the wrong account. It re-credited Phil promptly, then re-credited him a second time and only demanded it back when the Baileys had unwittingly spent it. \"They've finally agreed to let us repay it at \u00a325 a month which, as our budget is so tight, means we'll exceed our overdraft limit with each payment,\" says Bailey. \"The Halifax has refused to increase our limit which means we'll go further into the red every month.\" \u0095Consumer massages the bank's conscience and the result is a fulsome apology for its inefficiency and the promise of a doubled overdraft to ease the payments.

      "byline": "Steven Lynch",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> <strong>Why were the Zimbabwean players all wearing black armbands during the second Test at Trent Bridge? </strong> asks Vid Gunapala </p> <p>There were actually three reasons. On the first morning of the match, the team heard that Tony Oates, a farmer, had been killed in a shoot-out defending his home. He was well-known to the tourists because his son, Jason, has played first-class cricket in Zimbabwe (and one match for Zimbabwe A). He is also reported to have been a great party-giver who often entertained the team. Then news came through that Guy Whittall's aunt, Julia, had died of cancer. She was the mother of Andy Whittall, the Test offspinner who missed this tour but had been commentating on the Tests for Channel 4. Finally, allrounder Gary Brent (who spent quite a lot of time on the field at Trent Bridge as 12th man after Stuart Carlisle broke a finger) learned that his mother had suffered a fatal heart attack.</p> <p> <strong>What was the Test and first-class record of Graham Yallop, that elegant Australian batsman from the 1970s and 1980s? </strong> asks Dennis Glover from Canberra, Australia</p> <p>Yallop, a hard-hitting left-hander, won 39 Test caps, scoring 2756 runs at an average of 41.13. He made eight Test centuries, the highest 268 against Pakistan at Melbourne, his home ground, in 1983-84. In all first-class cricket he made 11,615 runs at 45.90, with 30 centuries. Despite those more-than-useful batting statistics he is probably best remembered, rather unfairly, as the captain who lost an Ashes series 5-1. That was in 1978-79, when many of the leading Australians were banned because of their involvement with World Series Cricket. Yallop's second-stringers struggled against Mike Brearley's England side. He later went on a rebel tour of South Africa.</p> <p> <strong>I am writing a play for Radio 4 and need to know the most famous player(s) of 1913 for a bit of dialogue. Can you help? </strong> asks Jan Hartman</p> <p>There weren't any Tests in 1913, so cricket-lovers in England would probably have been talking about the County Championship, which was won by Kent, captained by the amateur EW Dillon. For many years the tall, elegant left-hander Frank Woolley was the pick of Kent's batsmen, and in 1913 he made 1760 runs at 45 (and also took 83 wickets at 18). But he wasn't Kent's leading runscorer that year: it was HTW \"Wally\" Hardinge, with 2037 runs at 41. Hardinge was an interesting character who also played football for England, and worked for John Wisden &amp; Co (publishers of the Almanack) for many years as a sales rep. Kent's leading bowler was Colin \"Charlie\" Blythe (167 wickets at 16), a slow left-arm bowler who was killed at Passchendaele in 1917. Kent (110 points) won the Championship by 15 points from runners-up Yorkshire, whose outstanding performer was Major Booth (Major was his name, not his rank), who scored 1228 runs and took 181 wickets, more than anyone else that season. He also died in the Great War, by which time Major Booth had become a Second Lieutenant.</p> <p>Overall English cricket's \"megastars\" of 1913 were probably the Surrey opener Jack Hobbs \u00d0 in the early stages of a career that would see him still playing for England at rising 50 \u00d0 and the controversial bowler Sydney Barnes, who had given up county cricket by then, in favour of a lucrative club contract, but was still good enough to play for England (the following winter, 1913-14, he took a record 49 wickets in only four Tests in South Africa).</p> <p> <strong>I am trying to find out some information about an Australian cricketer called Andrew Ian Butcher. I believe that he played a few games for South Australia in the late 1980s and a couple of one-dayers for Australia in about 1989. Do you have any record of his statistics? </strong> asks Stephen Wise</p> <p>There's no trace of an Andrew Ian Butcher in the Wisden records. No-one of that name seems to have played first-class cricket in Australia (and certainly not a Test or one-day international). Gideon Haigh, the editor of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack Australia\", has looked through available records for youth teams and can't find him either, although he cautions that there are a few gaps in the records in the 1980s.</p> <p><strong>Can you explain the complicated points system in the English County Championship? </strong> asks Giles Venn</p> <p>The points system has changed a lot over the years - and, predictably, has changed again for the current season. The easy part is that the side winning the match gets 12 points, and both sides receive four points in a drawn game (six points each for a tie; no points for losing). The complicated bit is the bonus points, which are only available in the first 130 overs of each side's first innings. You can earn a maximum of five batting bonus points, for passing 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400. And you get bowling points - a maximum of three - for taking three, six and nine wickets.

His first-class average is 65.18, one of the highest on record. In 29 Tests he made 2122 runs at 48.22, with 110 in his first Test (v England, Sydney, 1924-25) and 266 in his last (v England, The Oval, 1934), and five other centuries besides.

      "bodyText": "Why were the Zimbabwean players all wearing black armbands during the second Test at Trent Bridge? asks Vid Gunapala There were actually three reasons. On the first morning of the match, the team heard that Tony Oates, a farmer, had been killed in a shoot-out defending his home. He was well-known to the tourists because his son, Jason, has played first-class cricket in Zimbabwe (and one match for Zimbabwe A). He is also reported to have been a great party-giver who often entertained the team. Then news came through that Guy Whittall's aunt, Julia, had died of cancer. She was the mother of Andy Whittall, the Test offspinner who missed this tour but had been commentating on the Tests for Channel 4. Finally, allrounder Gary Brent (who spent quite a lot of time on the field at Trent Bridge as 12th man after Stuart Carlisle broke a finger) learned that his mother had suffered a fatal heart attack. What was the Test and first-class record of Graham Yallop, that elegant Australian batsman from the 1970s and 1980s? asks Dennis Glover from Canberra, Australia Yallop, a hard-hitting left-hander, won 39 Test caps, scoring 2756 runs at an average of 41.13. He made eight Test centuries, the highest 268 against Pakistan at Melbourne, his home ground, in 1983-84. In all first-class cricket he made 11,615 runs at 45.90, with 30 centuries. Despite those more-than-useful batting statistics he is probably best remembered, rather unfairly, as the captain who lost an Ashes series 5-1. That was in 1978-79, when many of the leading Australians were banned because of their involvement with World Series Cricket. Yallop's second-stringers struggled against Mike Brearley's England side. He later went on a rebel tour of South Africa. I am writing a play for Radio 4 and need to know the most famous player(s) of 1913 for a bit of dialogue. Can you help? asks Jan Hartman There weren't any Tests in 1913, so cricket-lovers in England would probably have been talking about the County Championship, which was won by Kent, captained by the amateur EW Dillon. For many years the tall, elegant left-hander Frank Woolley was the pick of Kent's batsmen, and in 1913 he made 1760 runs at 45 (and also took 83 wickets at 18). But he wasn't Kent's leading runscorer that year: it was HTW \"Wally\" Hardinge, with 2037 runs at 41. Hardinge was an interesting character who also played football for England, and worked for John Wisden &amp; Co (publishers of the Almanack) for many years as a sales rep. Kent's leading bowler was Colin \"Charlie\" Blythe (167 wickets at 16), a slow left-arm bowler who was killed at Passchendaele in 1917. Kent (110 points) won the Championship by 15 points from runners-up Yorkshire, whose outstanding performer was Major Booth (Major was his name, not his rank), who scored 1228 runs and took 181 wickets, more than anyone else that season. He also died in the Great War, by which time Major Booth had become a Second Lieutenant. Overall English cricket's \"megastars\" of 1913 were probably the Surrey opener Jack Hobbs \u00d0 in the early stages of a career that would see him still playing for England at rising 50 \u00d0 and the controversial bowler Sydney Barnes, who had given up county cricket by then, in favour of a lucrative club contract, but was still good enough to play for England (the following winter, 1913-14, he took a record 49 wickets in only four Tests in South Africa). I am trying to find out some information about an Australian cricketer called Andrew Ian Butcher. I believe that he played a few games for South Australia in the late 1980s and a couple of one-dayers for Australia in about 1989. Do you have any record of his statistics? asks Stephen Wise There's no trace of an Andrew Ian Butcher in the Wisden records. No-one of that name seems to have played first-class cricket in Australia (and certainly not a Test or one-day international). Gideon Haigh, the editor of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack Australia\", has looked through available records for youth teams and can't find him either, although he cautions that there are a few gaps in the records in the 1980s. Can you explain the complicated points system in the English County Championship? asks Giles Venn The points system has changed a lot over the years - and, predictably, has changed again for the current season. The easy part is that the side winning the match gets 12 points, and both sides receive four points in a drawn game (six points each for a tie; no points for losing). The complicated bit is the bonus points, which are only available in the first 130 overs of each side's first innings. You can earn a maximum of five batting bonus points, for passing 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400. And you get bowling points - a maximum of three - for taking three, six and nine wickets. So the maximum number of points a county can score in a game is 20. Where was Bill Ponsford noted for fielding? asks Michael Ford Bill Ponsford, who was born in 1900, was a prolific batsman - the only man to have scored two quadruple-centuries in first-class cricket.

      "byline": "Emma Brockes",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Harland Miller is dressed as if illustrating a lecture entitled Fashion: a brief history. He enters the Maison Bertaux in Soho carrying a copy of Gunter Grass's Local Anaesthetic. He's in Larry Hagman shades, big as wing-mirrors, a tight V-neck sweater and the pointed, slip-on shoes that were fashionable among the new romantic bands of the early 80s. His hair is a tribute to the blond icons of the jazz age. His voice, nasal and effete, is a cross between Jarvis Cocker's and Derek Draper's. He is a 36-year-old artist who has just published a novel and tends to his image as to one of his wacky installations. </p> <p>The effect Miller has had on both the publishing world and the celebrities who rely on it to supply them with intellectual party guests, has been explosive. His charms are amplified by the \u00a3150,000 advance he received for his first novel, Slow Down Arthur, Stick to Thirty, a coming-of-age story set in York in the 70s, encompassing such issues as teenage drug taking and wanting to be David Bowie. He has an ear for the visceral simile. A character hocking up phlegm is said to \"cradle the oyster on his tongue\" before spitting it into the sink. He can knock out a good epigram too. \"Kid Glover was 16,\" he writes, \"trying to make one coffee last for ever and shortly about to collapse face down in the snow.\" </p> <p>What he can not do is provide a written-through narrative that prevents the reader from drifting away at page 10, suddenly reminded of how short life is. Slow Down Arthur is at best a wry reminder of the coach journey back from a school trip, at worst a directionless ramble stuck on the myth that the secret of cult literature is to forgo any semblance of plot. </p> <p>None of this matters, however, when one is confronted with the spectacle of Miller in the flesh. If he brings credibility to his novel, it is by raising the possibility that it is not a piece of cynically written BritLit, but a more straightforward distillation of his personality. The book has no linearity because Miller cannot get to the end of a sentence without indefinitely stalling on a lost word or entangling himself in an endless domino run of anecdotes, each one further removed from the point of the conversation. In response to a question about how he came to write the novel, he comes out with the following. </p> <p>\"It started off in quite a jokey way, when I was using text as part of my artwork. There's a . . . I can't remember the name now. There was a comedian who had a tragic life. He spoke like this.\" Tony Hancock? </p> <p>\"Yes. He always wanted to be an intellectual. He did something called the Missing Page which was a famous sketch with that other bloke . . . what was his name?\" Sid James? </p> <p>\"Yeah. So I got this idea of having a crucial page that you read. That introduced you to the plot.\" </p> <p>What was on the crucial page? \"I don't think it really worked in that way. It was more like a sort of a, sort of a . . .\" (he pauses for an age, before abandoning the sentence and zooming in on the context in which he was writing the mysterious, missing page.) </p> <p>\"I was living in Berlin with a guy called Fergus Bremner. Berlin reminded me a bit of Salford in Manchester - the trams. We had this huge flat, so huge that we had an old bike we used to ride from one end to the other when the phone rang. We fell out, so I was often at the furthest end of the studio from him, so that when the phone went, he'd get on the bike and yell, Harland, it's the bloody phone.\" </p> <p>He continues: \"There was a squat, with people who made vehicles into mad affairs, put insect's heads on the front of them. For them, expression was like, part of their lives. But what happened was that they became commercial, because the government was in the process of turning the buildings into restaurants, so those with their eyes on the main chance started doing commercial art. Gentrification.\" </p> <p>A popular reading of this inarticulacy, if it is accompanied by good bone structure and a sufficiently iconic dress sense, is that it is the mark of unschooled genius. Miller has been seized on in certain quarters as an Andy Warhol-type figure, a man tongue-tied by the sheer depth of his brilliance. \"Harland is a dream package,\" gushes an anonymous but \"very fashionable\" friend of his in Vogue this month. \"He's an artist, he's handsome, he's stylish, he knows everyone there is to know in cool London and they all think he's divine.\" What's more, he's from Yorkshire. His father used to work in a sweet factory. He has the pluck and romance of the dirty-faced angel and like his friend Jarvis Cocker, speaks in the authentic voice of a man who has known real poverty. </p> <p>At the age of 17 Miller moved south to Epsom, on the outskirts of London, and tried to establish himself as an artist. His memories of the period are eccentrically selective. \"It was out in the middle of nowhere,\" he recalls. \"My landlady was Chinese and had this skin condition; the pigmentation didn't take and her skin was like camouflage. Different colours.\" Suddenly he jumps forward to the landlady he had while living in Berlin, 10 years later. \"She was the widow of Bertold Brecht's official biographer. Her son was a really tall guy and the room was full of Brecht posters, fantastic, one on top of the other so that there was no wall showing. They said 'You can't move in for a week', so I went to stay in a squat.\" </p> <p>A lengthy description of the squat follows, before Miller brings home the punchline. \"I went back to the room after a week, wondering why they'd made me wait. When they opened the door, I saw that they had covered over the beautiful walls with white woodchip and put up a shelf, in my honour. I had to pretend I liked it.\" </p> <p>There are other anecdotes, told in this fashion, attending Miller's vagabond journeys through Morocco and Tangiers, New York and the north circular. When asked what he was pursuing on these travels, he refers to an episode that happened to him as a child. He had his appendix out and was kept in hospital for three months, during the summer. His mother used to visit him every day and read aloud the short stories of Somerset Maugham.

      "bodyText": "Harland Miller is dressed as if illustrating a lecture entitled Fashion: a brief history. He enters the Maison Bertaux in Soho carrying a copy of Gunter Grass's Local Anaesthetic. He's in Larry Hagman shades, big as wing-mirrors, a tight V-neck sweater and the pointed, slip-on shoes that were fashionable among the new romantic bands of the early 80s. His hair is a tribute to the blond icons of the jazz age. His voice, nasal and effete, is a cross between Jarvis Cocker's and Derek Draper's. He is a 36-year-old artist who has just published a novel and tends to his image as to one of his wacky installations. The effect Miller has had on both the publishing world and the celebrities who rely on it to supply them with intellectual party guests, has been explosive. His charms are amplified by the \u00a3150,000 advance he received for his first novel, Slow Down Arthur, Stick to Thirty, a coming-of-age story set in York in the 70s, encompassing such issues as teenage drug taking and wanting to be David Bowie. He has an ear for the visceral simile. A character hocking up phlegm is said to \"cradle the oyster on his tongue\" before spitting it into the sink. He can knock out a good epigram too. \"Kid Glover was 16,\" he writes, \"trying to make one coffee last for ever and shortly about to collapse face down in the snow.\" What he can not do is provide a written-through narrative that prevents the reader from drifting away at page 10, suddenly reminded of how short life is. Slow Down Arthur is at best a wry reminder of the coach journey back from a school trip, at worst a directionless ramble stuck on the myth that the secret of cult literature is to forgo any semblance of plot. None of this matters, however, when one is confronted with the spectacle of Miller in the flesh. If he brings credibility to his novel, it is by raising the possibility that it is not a piece of cynically written BritLit, but a more straightforward distillation of his personality. The book has no linearity because Miller cannot get to the end of a sentence without indefinitely stalling on a lost word or entangling himself in an endless domino run of anecdotes, each one further removed from the point of the conversation. In response to a question about how he came to write the novel, he comes out with the following. \"It started off in quite a jokey way, when I was using text as part of my artwork. There's a . . . I can't remember the name now. There was a comedian who had a tragic life. He spoke like this.\" Tony Hancock? \"Yes. He always wanted to be an intellectual. He did something called the Missing Page which was a famous sketch with that other bloke . . . what was his name?\" Sid James? \"Yeah. So I got this idea of having a crucial page that you read. That introduced you to the plot.\" What was on the crucial page? \"I don't think it really worked in that way. It was more like a sort of a, sort of a . . .\" (he pauses for an age, before abandoning the sentence and zooming in on the context in which he was writing the mysterious, missing page.) \"I was living in Berlin with a guy called Fergus Bremner. Berlin reminded me a bit of Salford in Manchester - the trams. We had this huge flat, so huge that we had an old bike we used to ride from one end to the other when the phone rang. We fell out, so I was often at the furthest end of the studio from him, so that when the phone went, he'd get on the bike and yell, Harland, it's the bloody phone.\" He continues: \"There was a squat, with people who made vehicles into mad affairs, put insect's heads on the front of them. For them, expression was like, part of their lives. But what happened was that they became commercial, because the government was in the process of turning the buildings into restaurants, so those with their eyes on the main chance started doing commercial art. Gentrification.\" A popular reading of this inarticulacy, if it is accompanied by good bone structure and a sufficiently iconic dress sense, is that it is the mark of unschooled genius. Miller has been seized on in certain quarters as an Andy Warhol-type figure, a man tongue-tied by the sheer depth of his brilliance. \"Harland is a dream package,\" gushes an anonymous but \"very fashionable\" friend of his in Vogue this month. \"He's an artist, he's handsome, he's stylish, he knows everyone there is to know in cool London and they all think he's divine.\" What's more, he's from Yorkshire. His father used to work in a sweet factory. He has the pluck and romance of the dirty-faced angel and like his friend Jarvis Cocker, speaks in the authentic voice of a man who has known real poverty. At the age of 17 Miller moved south to Epsom, on the outskirts of London, and tried to establish himself as an artist. His memories of the period are eccentrically selective. \"It was out in the middle of nowhere,\" he recalls. \"My landlady was Chinese and had this skin condition; the pigmentation didn't take and her skin was like camouflage. Different colours.\" Suddenly he jumps forward to the landlady he had while living in Berlin, 10 years later. \"She was the widow of Bertold Brecht's official biographer. Her son was a really tall guy and the room was full of Brecht posters, fantastic, one on top of the other so that there was no wall showing. They said 'You can't move in for a week', so I went to stay in a squat.\" A lengthy description of the squat follows, before Miller brings home the punchline. \"I went back to the room after a week, wondering why they'd made me wait. When they opened the door, I saw that they had covered over the beautiful walls with white woodchip and put up a shelf, in my honour. I had to pretend I liked it.\" There are other anecdotes, told in this fashion, attending Miller's vagabond journeys through Morocco and Tangiers, New York and the north circular. When asked what he was pursuing on these travels, he refers to an episode that happened to him as a child. He had his appendix out and was kept in hospital for three months, during the summer. His mother used to visit him every day and read aloud the short stories of Somerset Maugham. He would drift in and out of consciousness to the lull of her voice. \"It was hot and everything and because of the morphine, it was all a bit William Burroughsey, hearing bits of Maugham interspersed with the Famous Five books I was reading.\" The experience did two things: forced a state of introspection on him that he never shook off, and persuaded him that mild delirium is a natural state for the artist. \"My life used to be characterised by space and time. I'd look in a shop window and wonder how long I'd been looking in.\" This feeling of \"lost time\", he says, was identified by Danny Boyle, whose production company is making the film version, as the primary strength of the book. \"The production guys said that the fact that nothing really happens is the book's strength, which I thought was great. I was worried that they would make each character go through an evolution, so that this character has to get the girl, or this one has to die or kick drugs.\" He hates west London, finds the idea of \"having to go for cappuccinos the whole time\" irksome and would rather hang around north London with his wife Jane and his nine-month-old baby. \"I live in Mornington Crescent. I looked all over the place and when I found Mornington Crescent I thought, yeah, because it's a nowhere place, I like the anonymity. I like to go out and buy milk without bumping into people. The train station is like a ghost station, you go straight through it. It's like, subliminal.\" But he still dresses like a man who wants to be noticed.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The decision to break up Microsoft into two parts - one company owning the Windows operating system and the other the software applications and browser - is good for the computer industry and, quite likely, for Microsoft itself in the long run. But it won't have any immediate impact on the real world. This is because of the company's decision to appeal not only against the breakup decision but also against the restraints on its behaviour that the judge imposed while the substantive issue was being finally resolved.</p> <p>And then? The success of a split will critically depend on human behaviour. If it merely produces two Siamese twins, or parallel monopolies, each instinctively - one might almost say genetically - knowing what the other will do then the monopoly situation could worsen.</p> <p>In the short run Microsoft's operating system will still reside on well over 90% of the world's personal computers and software packages such as the Excel spreadsheet and Word word processor will still have a similar market share. The system and the software will create demand for each other's products. Being two corporate units rather than one might tempt them to raise their prices faster (or reduce them less fast) than if they remained one integrated whole with the justice department breathing down its neck.</p> <p>If Bill Gates decided to run the applications company, it is difficult to imagine him trying to undermine the Windows operating system he built up and protected for so long by trying aggressively to sell products to other emerging platforms such as the free alternative, Linux. And will the two companies still be based on the same campus at Redmond with the same or adjacent canteens?</p> <p> Yet, properly handled, this judgment could unleash submerged creative forces among the thousands of highly skilled Microsoft employees. As Walter Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal has pointed out, some of Microsoft's best products, such as Internet Explorer and Money, have emerged when the company has faced real competitive pressures.</p> <p>The breakup of Microsoft would open countless new opportunities for software developers all over the world. At the moment no venture capitalist is going fund startups trying to sell rival spreadsheets, word processors or browsers against the might of Microsoft's integrated monopoly. New products in these areas have very little chance against the integrated packages that Microsoft offers locked into its own operating system.</p> <p> What beggars belief is Microsoft's almost total inability to see, let alone admit, that it has done anything wrong despite the devastating catalogue of uncompetitive practices that the department of justice has unearthed.</p> <p>Microsoft's self-interest dictates that it will oppose this judgment. The longer it delays the start of the split, the longer it will take to finish it. And even when the split is completed it will be years before effective competition can undermine the armlock that both new companies will have on their customers. It will be a major decision for companies to abandon the Windows system they are locked into. During this time, the industry Microsoft has dominated for so long will be shifting its field of battle to the internet, which Microsoft hopes will strengthen its argument that the justice department does not understand the dynamics of the industry.</p> <p> Above all, Microsoft has reason to stall because the longer it does the longer it hangs on to its monopoly profits. Remember, the bottom line of all this is that Microsoft has been earning far higher profits than it should have been in virtue of its monopoly position. Should some of them not be handed back so they do not continue to give the two companies an advantageous war chest?</p> <p> If the judge started to threaten huge backdated fines based on the scale of its monopoly profits Microsoft might have a vested interest in taking the judgment of the court more seriously.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The decision to break up Microsoft into two parts - one company owning the Windows operating system and the other the software applications and browser - is good for the computer industry and, quite likely, for Microsoft itself in the long run. But it won't have any immediate impact on the real world. This is because of the company's decision to appeal not only against the breakup decision but also against the restraints on its behaviour that the judge imposed while the substantive issue was being finally resolved. And then? The success of a split will critically depend on human behaviour. If it merely produces two Siamese twins, or parallel monopolies, each instinctively - one might almost say genetically - knowing what the other will do then the monopoly situation could worsen. In the short run Microsoft's operating system will still reside on well over 90% of the world's personal computers and software packages such as the Excel spreadsheet and Word word processor will still have a similar market share. The system and the software will create demand for each other's products. Being two corporate units rather than one might tempt them to raise their prices faster (or reduce them less fast) than if they remained one integrated whole with the justice department breathing down its neck. If Bill Gates decided to run the applications company, it is difficult to imagine him trying to undermine the Windows operating system he built up and protected for so long by trying aggressively to sell products to other emerging platforms such as the free alternative, Linux. And will the two companies still be based on the same campus at Redmond with the same or adjacent canteens? Yet, properly handled, this judgment could unleash submerged creative forces among the thousands of highly skilled Microsoft employees. As Walter Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal has pointed out, some of Microsoft's best products, such as Internet Explorer and Money, have emerged when the company has faced real competitive pressures. The breakup of Microsoft would open countless new opportunities for software developers all over the world. At the moment no venture capitalist is going fund startups trying to sell rival spreadsheets, word processors or browsers against the might of Microsoft's integrated monopoly. New products in these areas have very little chance against the integrated packages that Microsoft offers locked into its own operating system. What beggars belief is Microsoft's almost total inability to see, let alone admit, that it has done anything wrong despite the devastating catalogue of uncompetitive practices that the department of justice has unearthed. Microsoft's self-interest dictates that it will oppose this judgment. The longer it delays the start of the split, the longer it will take to finish it. And even when the split is completed it will be years before effective competition can undermine the armlock that both new companies will have on their customers. It will be a major decision for companies to abandon the Windows system they are locked into. During this time, the industry Microsoft has dominated for so long will be shifting its field of battle to the internet, which Microsoft hopes will strengthen its argument that the justice department does not understand the dynamics of the industry. Above all, Microsoft has reason to stall because the longer it does the longer it hangs on to its monopoly profits. Remember, the bottom line of all this is that Microsoft has been earning far higher profits than it should have been in virtue of its monopoly position. Should some of them not be handed back so they do not continue to give the two companies an advantageous war chest? If the judge started to threaten huge backdated fines based on the scale of its monopoly profits Microsoft might have a vested interest in taking the judgment of the court more seriously.",

How can I disable it? <br> <strong>John Mathias</strong><br> London <a href=\"mailto:j.mathias@ntlworld.com\"> j.mathias@ntlworld.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Jack Schofield: </strong> The quick answer is to go to Internet Explorer's Tools menu, pick Internet Options, go to the Connections tab and click to select \"Never dial a connection\". However, this does not remove the potential problems with web-style mail, coded in HTML, which can run scripts and can carry viruses such as VBS/Bubbleboy and VBS/Kakworm. </p> <p>Merely reading a message infected with Kakworm allows it to put a file called KAK.HTA into Windows' Start-up folder. The next time Windows is started, it creates a file called C:\\WINDOWS\\ KAK.HTM which changes the Microsoft Outlook Express registry settings to add the virus to your outgoing email as a signature. </p> <p>The last of these fortnightly columns explained how to disable the Windows Scripting Host program that runs Visual Basic Scripts (VBS). </p> <p>It's also possible to disable scripting in Internet Explorer. In IE5, go to the Tools| Internet Options|Security tab (remember, Outlook Express is part of the Internet Explorer suite) and raise the default security level or click Custom Level and do it manually. </p> <p>However, Bubbleboy and Kakworm actually exploit one of Microsoft's mistakes, which was to mark two small files (scriptlet.typelib and Eyedog) as being \"safe for scripting\" when they aren't. Microsoft published a patch to fix this on August 31: see <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-032.asp\">www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-032.asp</a> </p> <p> Users of IE4 and IE5 for Windows 95/98 should have downloaded the fix but we didn't.

      "bodyText": "Catching Kakworm I have taken the view that email-borne viruses are only a danger if one intentionally opens an attachment, and I proceed only after seeing who it is from and its title in the preview pane of Outlook Express. Recently I have received emails from Microsoft, eFax.com and others which initiate an internet connection to their website by automatically starting a dial-up networking connection. I understand the reason for this, but I realise that someone with a malicious intent could do considerable damage using this type of embedded code. How can I disable it? John Mathias London j.mathias@ntlworld.com Jack Schofield: The quick answer is to go to Internet Explorer's Tools menu, pick Internet Options, go to the Connections tab and click to select \"Never dial a connection\". However, this does not remove the potential problems with web-style mail, coded in HTML, which can run scripts and can carry viruses such as VBS/Bubbleboy and VBS/Kakworm. Merely reading a message infected with Kakworm allows it to put a file called KAK.HTA into Windows' Start-up folder. The next time Windows is started, it creates a file called C:\\WINDOWS\\ KAK.HTM which changes the Microsoft Outlook Express registry settings to add the virus to your outgoing email as a signature. The last of these fortnightly columns explained how to disable the Windows Scripting Host program that runs Visual Basic Scripts (VBS). It's also possible to disable scripting in Internet Explorer. In IE5, go to the Tools| Internet Options|Security tab (remember, Outlook Express is part of the Internet Explorer suite) and raise the default security level or click Custom Level and do it manually. However, Bubbleboy and Kakworm actually exploit one of Microsoft's mistakes, which was to mark two small files (scriptlet.typelib and Eyedog) as being \"safe for scripting\" when they aren't. Microsoft published a patch to fix this on August 31: see www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-032.asp Users of IE4 and IE5 for Windows 95/98 should have downloaded the fix but we didn't.

Four paragraphs down she alludes to the \"beating and torture I experienced in marriage some 30 years ago\".

All the police need, then, is the name of the hotel and the men can be questioned. But Dworkin has not been to the police. She came round from the assault to find a \"big, strange bruise\" on one breast and \"huge deep gashes\" on one leg which would not stop bleeding. </p> <p>For some reason she did not call a doctor to staunch the bleeding; neither did she call hotel security nor the police. The reluctance of a rape victim to be further violated by examination and questioning is understood, but if this is what prevented Dworkin from seeking help it does not seem consistent with her current decision to relive the ordeal, in vivid detail, for readers of the New Statesman. </p> <p>Reflecting on the easiness of this new form of assault, she writes: \"You can do this hundreds of times with virtually no chance of getting caught . . .\" Well, you can if women you have raped do not call a doctor when they wake up bruised and bleeding.

Over the past few years Nasa researchers led by Steve Ostro at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California have taken the briefly available opportunities to get radar bounces from various small asteroids whizzing close by the Earth, revealing the expected rocky shapes. Some look like peanuts, some like potatoes, others like footballs in need of a pumping up. </p> <p>But the huge numbers of asteroids in the main belt, more than 100 million miles away, were too distant, out of the range of their radar equipment.

This has dramatically improved its sensitivity, making observations of more distant objects feasible. </p> <p>The Arecibo radar employs a dish 1,000 feet across, fixed in place in a natural bowl-shaped valley to the north of the island. It is not steerable in the way that most radio telescopes, such as that at Jodrell Bank, can be directed to any point in the sky. So astronomers using Arecibo need to choose targets that happen to pass overhead during their observation runs. </p> <p>The first main belt asteroid to be selected was Kleopatra. This object, discovered in 1880, was not thought to be remarkable in any way. It was just a suitably located target on which to test the new radar system. Data from optical telescopes indicated a size of about 100 miles, and its colour indicated a metallic composition. Because metals are good reflectors of radio waves, a strong echo seemed likely. </p> <p>This was a complicated experiment. Kleopatra was so far away - further away than the sun from the earth - it took the radar pulse 19 minutes to make the round trip. A strong echo was obtained, but it varied in a way which initially perplexed the astronomers. As more data were collected, it became possible to build up a picture of the overall shape of the asteroid. It looks somewhat like a dumb-bell, 135 miles long and 58 miles wide. \"With its dog bone shape, Kleopatra has the most unusual shape we've seen in the solar system,\" commented Ostro. </p> <p>The best guess is that the surprising shape may be the result of some phenomenal inter-asteroid collision many aeons ago. The lumps thrown off at high speed in that collision may then have made their way to our planet, some of them ending up in museum collections of meteorites. Many meteorites have nickel-iron compositions similar to the presumed make-up of Kleopatra, making it a candidate parent body for at least some of these samples. So maybe we've got some of the meat off the dog's bone available for study in our laboratories. </p> <p>Alternatively, rather than Kleopatra originally having been more rounded, and disfigured by a cataclysmic collision, perhaps it gradually accumulated debris to attain this form. </p> <p>Another member of the team, Scott Hudson of Washington State University, suggests that the asteroid \"may once have been two separate lobes in orbit around each other with empty space between, subsequent impacts filling in the area between the lobes with debris.\" This idea has appeal because the radar echoes also indicate Kleopatra to be somewhat porous, rather than one solid lump of metal. </p> <p>The shape of Kleopatra remains a mystery for the time being. If it tells us anything, it's that we still have much to learn about asteroid origins and collisions. We can expect nothing less than the unexpected as more members of the asteroid zoo are unveiled in the coming years. </p> <p>\u0095 Duncan Steel researches asteroids and comets at the University of Salford.</p>",

Data from optical telescopes indicated a size of about 100 miles, and its colour indicated a metallic composition. Because metals are good reflectors of radio waves, a strong echo seemed likely. This was a complicated experiment. Kleopatra was so far away - further away than the sun from the earth - it took the radar pulse 19 minutes to make the round trip. A strong echo was obtained, but it varied in a way which initially perplexed the astronomers. As more data were collected, it became possible to build up a picture of the overall shape of the asteroid. It looks somewhat like a dumb-bell, 135 miles long and 58 miles wide. \"With its dog bone shape, Kleopatra has the most unusual shape we've seen in the solar system,\" commented Ostro. The best guess is that the surprising shape may be the result of some phenomenal inter-asteroid collision many aeons ago. The lumps thrown off at high speed in that collision may then have made their way to our planet, some of them ending up in museum collections of meteorites. Many meteorites have nickel-iron compositions similar to the presumed make-up of Kleopatra, making it a candidate parent body for at least some of these samples. So maybe we've got some of the meat off the dog's bone available for study in our laboratories. Alternatively, rather than Kleopatra originally having been more rounded, and disfigured by a cataclysmic collision, perhaps it gradually accumulated debris to attain this form. Another member of the team, Scott Hudson of Washington State University, suggests that the asteroid \"may once have been two separate lobes in orbit around each other with empty space between, subsequent impacts filling in the area between the lobes with debris.\" This idea has appeal because the radar echoes also indicate Kleopatra to be somewhat porous, rather than one solid lump of metal. The shape of Kleopatra remains a mystery for the time being. If it tells us anything, it's that we still have much to learn about asteroid origins and collisions. We can expect nothing less than the unexpected as more members of the asteroid zoo are unveiled in the coming years. \u0095 Duncan Steel researches asteroids and comets at the University of Salford.",

      "body": "<p>Markus Vater rarely seems to leave the nest he has built out of canvases and boards in a corner of the exhibition space at the Royal College of Art in London. It is degree show time, and students who have just been awarded their MA are strutting their stuff: paintings with sexy come-on subjects such as transvestitism, adolescent fantasy and eastern Europe. </p> <p>There's a printmaking student with swastikas tattooed all over him standing on a plinth. But Vater has disappeared into the little house he has built in the middle of this trade fair. A sign over the door welcomes you into The Bruce Lee Gallery. Inside there are lots of ideas for art presented on tiny flags on a table top, and today (the exhibits change) a wall covered with crudely drawn covers for magazines, including one about travel with a feature asking \"What is a street?\" </p> <p>The artist is inside, welcoming people into his world. He is a young German who plans to stay in London and work, but he acknowledges this will be hard. All around Vater's inward-turned, gently aggressive installation are paintings with red stickers on them, the badge of immediate commercial success; baby artists selling for four-figure sums. </p> <p>\"He's a situationist; how do you define success for a situationist?\" says Professor Graham Crowley, responsible for the RCA's MA course in painting, when I ask him about Vater. But it's a funny thing. If what you want is to become a real artist who will one day appear in the history books, those red stickers don't mean much. The sharper students know this. They don't think Markus Vater has gone nuts at all. They walk past the Bruce Lee Gallery with a certain envy. </p> <p>This is the time of the year when art colleges put on their degree shows - the art world's coming-out parties. Artists are formally introduced to the world in which they want to be stars. They meet dealers, curators, critics, collectors. \"If you asked the students which is the most important, the degree or the exhibition,\" says Christopher Frayling, rector of the RCA, \"they would all say the exhibition.\" Coming up over the next few weeks are the MA show at the Slade, the BA and MA shows at Goldsmiths and - for a handful of students from around the country who made it through the selection process - the annual New Contemporaries exhibition, which this year will be held for the first time in Milton Keynes. </p> <p>But what really happens at these shows? On the surface they are aggressively commercial affairs. Charles Saatchi comes. He's been sniffing around the painting MA show at the RCA and, says Crowley, was impressed by the way this course has turned itself into a broad preparation for art careers in the manner made famous by Goldsmiths. He's not letting on who Saatchi might buy. \"I think he'd find that embarrassing.\" </p> <p>Beyond purchases, Saatchi will be giving a graduate from each of the leading London colleges a fellowship. Less famous collectors come too, and buy. But the real business of becoming an artist has been going on from the moment students began their courses, and for the ones likely to last the distance the immediate glitz of the degree shows is just window dressing. What is really happening - behind the red stickers and the students torn between friendship and rivalry as they man the press desk and hand out price lists - is an exercise in the applied philosophy of art. </p> <p>\"To see something as art,\" the philosopher Arthur C Danto has written, \"requires something the eye cannot descry - an atmosphere of artistic theory, a knowledge of the history of art: an art world.\" </p> <p>The degree shows are about being recognised by the art world; written up in the art world's magazines, included in its group shows, name-dropped by its curators. By recognition, I mean the acknowledgement that this artist exists. Without that, it doesn't matter if you sell or don't sell, if you spend all day in the studio or become a Sunday artist with a day job. A painting can look like a painting and yet not be \"art\" in the sense the London art world means it; it's just a pretty object. And now, with the opening of Tate Modern and White Cube2 and a London branch of the glamorous New York gallery Gagosian and the serious challenge being made by this city to displace New York as capital of the art world, the students with a future are the ones who understand the art world's rules. </p> <p>\"You can easily earn as much money doing a fairly low-paid job as you would selling a painting; if I look at how I make money it's not from art,\" says Ian Kiaer, one of the sharpest students in this year's painting graduation class at the RCA. I first met Kiaer when I did a \"crit\" - an oral review - of the RCA's interim painting show a few months ago. This event in itself was an example of how art education is geared towards understanding the art world. </p> <p>It was curated, as is the final show, by Matthew Higgs, an omnipresent and hugely influential figure in the London art world, and the students invited a critic and a dealer to do a crit that took eight hours. Eight hours. I was most struck by the comments made by a third \"expert\" at the session: I assumed he was a teacher, he was so was articulate and authoritative. </p> <p>In fact this was Kiaer, a student himself. He is slightly older than most of his classmates and already has a profile in art circles. He was selected for last year's New Contemporaries and has more exhibitions set up on leaving than any of the others, including a group show with the West End dealer Asprey Jacques, and will feature in the prestigious European show Manifesta in the summer. Ian Kiaer knows what he's doing. </p> <p>It hasn't got much to do with selling stuff, or even making a splash, at the RCA degree show. Kiaer's main contribution is a paper and wood structure reproducing his own studio. It's very eastern, very quiet. There's a blurry picture on the wall, a diagram of a crystalline structure. It's not the best work here, but it has confidence in its own line of thought; Kiaer is dealing with ideas about the nature of landscape, ideas that are distinctive enough to give him, already, a visibility in the art world. The way he sees his career over the next few years, he says, is not selling but \"making work and showing it\". </p> <p>We are sitting in the RCA common room, and some of the other highly ambitious students in Kiaer's class are explaining their strategies for success. There is a dividing line between those who are making art for the art world and those who are still not quite getting it, who are making art for anyone who looks at it. The latter are going to find it much harder to make sense to curators and critics. </p> <p>Joanna Whittle is precariously poised on that dividing line - \"on an edge\" as Crowley puts it - doing richly textured, brown-hued paintings of landscapes in eastern Europe. At first glance they are just old-fashioned, but on second glance they are calculatedly, interestingly old- fashioned. The question is whether she will be seen as a traditional figurative painter (and therefore of no interest to the art world) or whether her paintings will be recognised by that world as retro-expressive games, and therefore as having attitude. It could go either way. </p> <p>This is the kind of work Charles Saatchi would certainly have picked up when he was in his \"neurotic realism\" phase - but now? She is selling well in the short term - red stickers galore - but she says: \"The important thing is not to rely on the work to make money, because if you did you'd change the work. I think most people who do like them like them because they're nice to look at - they like them as landscapes. I can't really change the way I work. I don't really know how the art world sees you.\" </p> <p>Marta Marc\u00e9 has a pretty good idea of how the art world sees her, and the news is good. She alone from this RCA class has been selected to be in this year's New Contemporaries, by a panel representing the three estates of the art world: artist Gavin Turk, critic Sarah Kent and curator Jeremy Millar. Marc\u00e9, who came to the RCA from Barcelona and - like Markus Vater the wacky German - is proof that London is now the art centre of Europe, makes cool abstract paintings controlled by her use of geometrical shapes, patterns of squares and circles, with lucid colours and relaxed gestures. They speak a language of high modern art and speak it fluently. \"With most student work you can see who they've been influenced by,\" says Kent. \"Hers looks very fresh.\" If you want to make a safe bet, put it on Marta Marc\u00e9. </p> <p>Yet, just like Kiaer, she pushes away talk of selling and dealers. Her ambition now is to look for a studio space, \"probably with more people from the course, and we will try to continue with new work; I will send some slides to Asprey Jacques but I'm not too sure, you know\". When it comes to a dealer, she says: \"I don't know anybody who's got that.\" This is not just a pose. It's the thing you have to get your head around: that appearing in shows such as New Contemporaries and getting reviewed in art magazines matters more than red stickers. </p> <p>You can see the problem for young artists such as Jared Fisher and Simon Willems, both of whom have sold well in the degree show. Their paintings are not as resolved as Marc\u00e9's. They both play with post-modern pastiche and cod surrealism, a look that may sell to private buyers but will look like yesterday's news to the art world. \"I don't really know why people buy work. Maybe they want to decorate their house,\" says Fisher. \"To them that has value.\" </p> <p>It's a dangerously naive view. If you want to make it in the art world, you need to know why people buy the work, what people see in the work, and, most decisively, who those people are. The right people are not looking for a nice painting. Fisher and Willems - who says that \"Agnews [traditional art dealers] are starting a contemporary gallery and I got an email the other day saying was I interested, which was a good lead\" - still have time to work out what the art world wants. </p> <p>None of these graduates are anything other than very talented, immaculately able artists, but if we have learned one thing from the sensational success of British art in the past decade, it is that talent or skill alone has nothing to do with becoming a famous artist. This is not because art is a con, but because it is an intellectual game. It's a game of recognition, of constantly stretching the parameters of what can be defined as art. Being an art student today is confusing, because what makes an artist is, finally, nothing you can put your finger on: it is the art world. </p> <p>In his own little art world, Markus Vater is laughing at the whole business. His private gallery in the middle of the RCA show is a parody art space in which everything the students will encounter in the next few years - the curators, the critics, the negotiation with art history - is displayed in microcosm. Visitors pop their heads in and walk away. The red stickers go to other work and he mutters about the hierarchy of whose work is where. When he leaves the RCA he sees himself getting a part-time job and trying to run a space in the east end somewhere. What a loser. </p> <p>I talk to the dealer with whom I did the crit, Mary-Jane Aladren of Nylon in west London, about the RCA degree show and we chat about who will have a serious career. The name she comes up with is Markus Vater.</p>",

      "body": "<p> Apple's decision to delay the release of MacOS X - the long-awaited successor to the Mac's venerable system software - disappointed many Mac users, but came as no surprise. The story of Apple's attempt to create a brand new, up-to-date operating system has had such a soap opera quality that as the final episode nears, a last-minute plot twist seemed inevitable. </p> <p> You almost expect the chief executive officer Steve Jobs to lean out of the shower and tell us all it was just a bad dream, Sue-Ellen. </p> <p> And to Mac users, MacOS X - it's a roman numeral, not a letter - is something of a dream. It promises Mac owners the kind of crash-free computing they've hoped to get from their system software but have never had. And it comes with a new graphical user interface, Aqua, that Apple claims will put the Mac as far ahead of Windows as it was back before Microsoft released Windows 95. </p> <p> Sounds too good to be true? It's beginning to feel that way too. Last January, at the bi-annual gathering of Mac fans, MacWorld Expo San Francisco, Jobs unveiled MacOS X and promised to ship it, shrinkwrapped \"in the summer\" and bundle it with all shipping Macs early 2001. </p> <p> But at last month's Worldwide Developers' Conference (WWDC), we learned the new operating system, built pretty much fresh from the ground up, would arrive early next year, with the summer's release being relegated to a public test release of the as yet unfinished software - a \"beta\" version. Apple's spin doctors immediately attempted to persuade software authors at the conference and Mac users reading reports on the internet that the six-month slip was nothing of the kind. \"We're delivering the same software at the same time, but with different names,\" was how Phil Schiller, the company's VP for product marketing, put it. Which begs the question: how come you were previously willing to ask users to pay for unfinished software, but you're not now? </p> <p> Now the rotational paramedics go quiet - surprise, surprise. May's six-month setback is just the latest in a very long line of broken promises. Understandably broken, to be fair, since the creation of an operating system - the code that governs how a computer looks, feels and behaves - is no simple task. Even the mighty Microsoft regularly put back the release of what became Windows 2000 but started out as Windows NT version 5. And Linux has taken the best part of nine years and thousands of net-connected collaborators to reach the stage where it disturbs Bill Gates's sleep. </p> <p> In comparison, the genesis of Apple's next-generation operating system doesn't seem too extraordinary. But then we're not talking about the gestation of a single product. Unlike Linux and Windows 2000, MacOS X is the latest in a line of would-be successors to the classic MacOS, stretching right back to a 1987 research project called Pink. </p> <p> Pink ended up being spun out of the company as part of Apple's bizarre liaison with IBM in 1990, sent out into the world as Taligent, only to col lapse, product unshipped, in 1995. The irony: Pink/Taligent was an attempt to build an object-oriented OS - one made of small, highly efficient and re-useable chunks of soft ware code - something that Jobs, by then out of Apple, was hard a work on at his new company, NeXT. After Pink, Apple engineers in 1993 initiated project Raptor, the company's second attempt to build MacOS: The Next Generation. Raptor pretty much failed too, being finally rolled the following year into try three, Copland. </p> <p>This time Apple bosses figured they had the right strategy: create a brand new Mac operating system and imbue it with the features that would beat Microsoft's MacOS killer project, codenamed Chicago.</p> <p> Copland was originally codenamed Capone, after the mobster who brought the city of Chicago to its knees. But the release of Chicago (the OS) in 1995 as Windows 95, while Capone was still in Apple's labs, forced a hasty name change.

      "bodyText": "Apple's decision to delay the release of MacOS X - the long-awaited successor to the Mac's venerable system software - disappointed many Mac users, but came as no surprise. The story of Apple's attempt to create a brand new, up-to-date operating system has had such a soap opera quality that as the final episode nears, a last-minute plot twist seemed inevitable. You almost expect the chief executive officer Steve Jobs to lean out of the shower and tell us all it was just a bad dream, Sue-Ellen. And to Mac users, MacOS X - it's a roman numeral, not a letter - is something of a dream. It promises Mac owners the kind of crash-free computing they've hoped to get from their system software but have never had. And it comes with a new graphical user interface, Aqua, that Apple claims will put the Mac as far ahead of Windows as it was back before Microsoft released Windows 95. Sounds too good to be true? It's beginning to feel that way too. Last January, at the bi-annual gathering of Mac fans, MacWorld Expo San Francisco, Jobs unveiled MacOS X and promised to ship it, shrinkwrapped \"in the summer\" and bundle it with all shipping Macs early 2001. But at last month's Worldwide Developers' Conference (WWDC), we learned the new operating system, built pretty much fresh from the ground up, would arrive early next year, with the summer's release being relegated to a public test release of the as yet unfinished software - a \"beta\" version. Apple's spin doctors immediately attempted to persuade software authors at the conference and Mac users reading reports on the internet that the six-month slip was nothing of the kind. \"We're delivering the same software at the same time, but with different names,\" was how Phil Schiller, the company's VP for product marketing, put it. Which begs the question: how come you were previously willing to ask users to pay for unfinished software, but you're not now? Now the rotational paramedics go quiet - surprise, surprise. May's six-month setback is just the latest in a very long line of broken promises. Understandably broken, to be fair, since the creation of an operating system - the code that governs how a computer looks, feels and behaves - is no simple task. Even the mighty Microsoft regularly put back the release of what became Windows 2000 but started out as Windows NT version 5. And Linux has taken the best part of nine years and thousands of net-connected collaborators to reach the stage where it disturbs Bill Gates's sleep. In comparison, the genesis of Apple's next-generation operating system doesn't seem too extraordinary. But then we're not talking about the gestation of a single product. Unlike Linux and Windows 2000, MacOS X is the latest in a line of would-be successors to the classic MacOS, stretching right back to a 1987 research project called Pink. Pink ended up being spun out of the company as part of Apple's bizarre liaison with IBM in 1990, sent out into the world as Taligent, only to col lapse, product unshipped, in 1995. The irony: Pink/Taligent was an attempt to build an object-oriented OS - one made of small, highly efficient and re-useable chunks of soft ware code - something that Jobs, by then out of Apple, was hard a work on at his new company, NeXT. After Pink, Apple engineers in 1993 initiated project Raptor, the company's second attempt to build MacOS: The Next Generation. Raptor pretty much failed too, being finally rolled the following year into try three, Copland. This time Apple bosses figured they had the right strategy: create a brand new Mac operating system and imbue it with the features that would beat Microsoft's MacOS killer project, codenamed Chicago. Copland was originally codenamed Capone, after the mobster who brought the city of Chicago to its knees. But the release of Chicago (the OS) in 1995 as Windows 95, while Capone was still in Apple's labs, forced a hasty name change. It also brought a wake-up call to the Mac maker, which suddenly released it wasn't the main man any longer. In early 1996, Apple officially announced Copland and promised to ship it around the middle of the year. By then Apple's management was imploding, and Gil Amelio, brought in to rescue the company, had seen that Copland would not only be incompatible with existing Mac software, but wouldn't provide users' applications with any of the new, more powerful OS benefits. He canned the project and decided to buy in its replacement. Eventually, Apple bought NeXT, Steve Jobs' company, you'll recall, just before Christmas for $400m. The following month Apple announced Copland's replacement, Rhapsody (next-gen operating system number four), and pledged to ship it mid to late 1998. Unlike Copland, Rhapsody would provide that all-important backwards compatibility and bring in a powerful object-oriented approach to application creation, plus the two key features: memory protection, which allows an application to die without bringing the entire system down (as anyone who's experienced an Unexpected Type 1 Error will appreciate), and pre-emptive multi-tasking: the ability to run applications simultaneously and give each a full share of the host computer's hardware resources. Both sound highly abstruse but are essential to creating highly stable systems that don't fall over every time QuarkXPress goes off in a huff. And that was central to Apple's Rhapsody strategy: to provide its professional users, and those who develop software for them, with a solid operating system that could compete with Microsoft. For once, Apple was able to ship Rhapsody broadly on time. As 1998 rolled round, the company released MacOS X Server. Of course, in \"Operating System Street\", nothing is quite that simple, and Apple had already been forced to rethink Rhapsody/MacOS X by its major developers, led by Adobe, the creator of PhotoShop, who didn't want to rewrite all their popular applications solely to take advantage of the new OS features.

John and Andrea walked off deeper into the pub so as to find seats.</p> <p>\"I remember feeling an enormous rush of air and an orangey flash of light, and then I was on fire. I couldn't see any of the others. I ran out of the pub through the front which had been blown open.</p> <p>\"I waved my hands around trying to put myself out. My trousers were ripped and I was missing one shoe.\"</p> <p>It was not until three weeks later that Mr Dykes learned his pregnant wife had been killed along with Mr Light, and Nik Moore, a former partner of Mr Light's who had met up with the friends in London.</p> <p>When he learned of the deaths he was recovering from serious injuries, including a nail in the lung, shrapnel in the stomach and burns.</p> <p>Copeland, who denies the three murders, was not in court yesterday morning to hear the graphic account. The jury was told he was unwell. The 24-year-old engineering worker from Cove, Hampshire, returned to the dock in the afternoon escorted by a nurse.</p> <p>Yesterday morning John Light's partner Gary Partridge, who also survived the explosion, told how earlier in the day Mrs Dykes had been looking at dresses she could wear later in her pregnancy.</p> <p>In a statement, Mr Partridge spoke of the happy moments before the blast: \"It was good-humoured and we were chatting.

      "bodyText": "A man who lost his wife and unborn child when a bomb ripped apart a packed Soho pub told yesterday how a happy day out with friends ended in devastation. Computer expert Julian Dykes was with his wife Andrea, 27, and friends including John Light, 35, best man at their wedding, on a trip to see a show in London when they stopped for a drink at the Admiral Duncan pub last April. The gay bar had been targeted by nail bomber David Copeland because of his hatred of homosexual men, and the device he planted went off as the friends' drinks were being poured. In a statement read at Copeland's Old Bailey trial yesterday, Mr Dykes, 27, said: \"As I walked in I could see the pub was packed with people. John and Andrea walked off deeper into the pub so as to find seats. \"I remember feeling an enormous rush of air and an orangey flash of light, and then I was on fire. I couldn't see any of the others. I ran out of the pub through the front which had been blown open. \"I waved my hands around trying to put myself out. My trousers were ripped and I was missing one shoe.\" It was not until three weeks later that Mr Dykes learned his pregnant wife had been killed along with Mr Light, and Nik Moore, a former partner of Mr Light's who had met up with the friends in London. When he learned of the deaths he was recovering from serious injuries, including a nail in the lung, shrapnel in the stomach and burns. Copeland, who denies the three murders, was not in court yesterday morning to hear the graphic account. The jury was told he was unwell. The 24-year-old engineering worker from Cove, Hampshire, returned to the dock in the afternoon escorted by a nurse. Yesterday morning John Light's partner Gary Partridge, who also survived the explosion, told how earlier in the day Mrs Dykes had been looking at dresses she could wear later in her pregnancy. In a statement, Mr Partridge spoke of the happy moments before the blast: \"It was good-humoured and we were chatting. I can't remember what we were talking about, but we were all happy. \"All of a sudden I saw a flash of light and I heard a popping sound like a champagne cork. I instinctively ducked my head and covered my face. It appeared to be very calm for a few seconds then I could hear people start to shout and scream. I started to feel around on the floor to find John or Andrea or somebody. \"The smoke started to clear a little and I could see daylight at the front of the pub.\" He ran from the wreck expecting the others to follow. \"But when I saw some of the injuries other people were walking out with, I started to panic. I started to scream out John's name. Then I saw John being dragged out of the pub by two men. \"I stood and looked and had to do a double-take. I thought John had lost a leg but when I looked again it was because his leg was soaked in blood.\" Mr Partridge, badly injured, spent 13 days in a burns unit before he was told his partner had died soon after the blast. The officers who arrested Copeland and searched the bedsit he shared only with a pet rat described to the court yesterday how he kept a library of newspaper cuttings showing scenes of death and terrorist violence. Alongside a picture of his hero Adolf Hitler were photographs of bomb scenes from Northern Ireland, a \"Ku Klux Klan type photograph\" and a picture of a man hanged from a crane under the headline \"Death of a Vampire\". He also kept cuttings on racial stabbings, a picture of a woman stabbed in the head, and cuttings from his bombings in Brixton and Brick Lane. Copeland had a copy of Hitler's book Mein Kampf, and a knife engraved with the slogan \"Alles F\u00fcr Deutschland\" in a sheath embossed with an eagle and swastika. He had two letters from the National Socialist Movement, a group the court heard had disbanded since the bombings. It then had eight full members and 70 official supporters. Copeland, a full member, was appointed unit leader, responsible for development of the group in Hampshire, Wiltshire, Berkshire and Surrey. A letter from its leader, Tony Williams, welcomed him as a member and proclaimed: \"Let us all live in the hope that our racial brothers and sisters will find that which is within them, just as you have, and our strength will grow until that glorious day when the sun will once more dawn on our homeland and ultimately on a racially unified Aryan civilisation.\" The trial continues.",

Mr Straw's controversial scheme involves setting up a new internationally agreed list of \"safe countries\" from which Britain and other EU countries would not generally consider asylum applications. Those who fled countries where it was internationally recognised that severe human rights abuses were common would be given temporary protection under an international quota system. The radical aspect of Mr Straw's long-term plan involves allowing asylum seekers from recognised countries to apply for asylum from outside Britain or other haven countries, and so removing the need for them to smuggle themselves into Britain. The proposal would ensure they were no longer left at the mercy of the criminal trade of \"people traffickers\", as they would no longer be banned from claiming asylum until they broke through the borders of the first safe country.

      "body": "<p>The bank branch is dead. Or so we are led to believe by an increasing number of peculiarly named new entrants in the financial service arena, such as <a href=\"http://www.Egg.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Egg.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.First-e.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">First-e.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Smile.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Smile.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.IF.com\" target=\"_new\">IF.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Moneygator.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Moneygator.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Cahoot.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Cahoot.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>They bombard us with the message that we should put our old bank into the dustbin and come online instead. As a result of increasing use of the telephone and internet, \"big\" high street banks, such as Barclays, say they are being forced to close hundreds of branches and become somewhat less \" big\". But do most consumers really want a totally remote relationship? </p> <p>Experience from North America and Scandinavia suggests not. </p> <p>Take for example <a href=\"http://www.schwab.com\" target=\"_new\">Charles Schwab</a>, one of the most successful online stockbrokers in the US. It has 7 million customers and conducts an impressive 80% of its trans actions online. But despite massive advertising and a strong web presence, 70% of its new customers still sign up by walking into a branch. Seeing that its wolf in sheep's clothing strategy was so successful, Schwab built 49 new branches in 1999, bringing its total to 356. </p> <p>On the other hand, take the fate of the online-only mbanx, set up by the Bank of Montreal in October 1996. It was similar in intention to Halifax's IF or Abbey National's Cahoot. Management expected it to attract a million customers. Three-and-a-half years later, it had only 170,000 accounts, while more than a million of the Bank of Montreal's customers had opted for lower rates to retain the flexibility of banking by telephone and branch as well as online. </p> <p>In August 1999, Bank of Montreal folded the internet subsidiary back into the bank. As the bank's Denny Allen said: \"Customers were falling back on branches more than we have thought and wanted to retain their branch privileges while capturing attractive online rates.\" </p> <p>What can we learn from these experiences? </p> <p>First, most of us want the convenience of \"Martini banking\" - access any time, any place, anywhere - via any access device. While the telephone and internet may make up a larger share of our inter-actions with our financial institution, we also want the option to bank face to face, especially if there are banks prepared to continue to offer it. </p> <p>Second, lists of FAQs [Frequently Asked Questions] cannot answer non-standard questions or reassure us that the product is appropriate for our needs. Humans are still better, particularly for advice on complex or infrequently purchased products. </p> <p>Third, and most importantly, in an increasingly cluttered and volatile market place, how can we decide which institution is reliable? A physical location is a marvellous way to reinforce the impression of permanence and reduce marketing costs. </p> <p>Following in Schwab's footsteps, most of the born-on-the-web online stockbrokers, like the nouveau riche buying a country estate, are planting roots in the real world to broaden their appeal. </p> <p>The only trouble is that the internet community is afflicted bv Orwellian doublespeak and will not call a branch a branch. E*Trade calls branches 'investment centres', DAB refers to 'permanent trade fairs', and First-e has 'entertainment zones'. But the implication is clear. Many of the leading American and European players are seeing value in the physical. </p> <p>However, this is far from good news for the high street banks. The invasion of the customer snatchers is putting tremendous pressure on banks' profit margins, especially for simple products that can be sold directly, such as savings, credit cards and motor insurance. Banks will have to re-invent themselves and reduce costs aggressively. </p> <p>One way to do this is to significantly scale back branch networks.

      "bodyText": "The bank branch is dead. Or so we are led to believe by an increasing number of peculiarly named new entrants in the financial service arena, such as Egg.co.uk, First-e.co.uk, Smile.co.uk, IF.com, Moneygator.co.uk and Cahoot.co.uk. They bombard us with the message that we should put our old bank into the dustbin and come online instead. As a result of increasing use of the telephone and internet, \"big\" high street banks, such as Barclays, say they are being forced to close hundreds of branches and become somewhat less \" big\". But do most consumers really want a totally remote relationship? Experience from North America and Scandinavia suggests not. Take for example Charles Schwab, one of the most successful online stockbrokers in the US. It has 7 million customers and conducts an impressive 80% of its trans actions online. But despite massive advertising and a strong web presence, 70% of its new customers still sign up by walking into a branch. Seeing that its wolf in sheep's clothing strategy was so successful, Schwab built 49 new branches in 1999, bringing its total to 356. On the other hand, take the fate of the online-only mbanx, set up by the Bank of Montreal in October 1996. It was similar in intention to Halifax's IF or Abbey National's Cahoot. Management expected it to attract a million customers. Three-and-a-half years later, it had only 170,000 accounts, while more than a million of the Bank of Montreal's customers had opted for lower rates to retain the flexibility of banking by telephone and branch as well as online. In August 1999, Bank of Montreal folded the internet subsidiary back into the bank. As the bank's Denny Allen said: \"Customers were falling back on branches more than we have thought and wanted to retain their branch privileges while capturing attractive online rates.\" What can we learn from these experiences? First, most of us want the convenience of \"Martini banking\" - access any time, any place, anywhere - via any access device. While the telephone and internet may make up a larger share of our inter-actions with our financial institution, we also want the option to bank face to face, especially if there are banks prepared to continue to offer it. Second, lists of FAQs [Frequently Asked Questions] cannot answer non-standard questions or reassure us that the product is appropriate for our needs. Humans are still better, particularly for advice on complex or infrequently purchased products. Third, and most importantly, in an increasingly cluttered and volatile market place, how can we decide which institution is reliable? A physical location is a marvellous way to reinforce the impression of permanence and reduce marketing costs. Following in Schwab's footsteps, most of the born-on-the-web online stockbrokers, like the nouveau riche buying a country estate, are planting roots in the real world to broaden their appeal. The only trouble is that the internet community is afflicted bv Orwellian doublespeak and will not call a branch a branch. E*Trade calls branches 'investment centres', DAB refers to 'permanent trade fairs', and First-e has 'entertainment zones'. But the implication is clear. Many of the leading American and European players are seeing value in the physical. However, this is far from good news for the high street banks. The invasion of the customer snatchers is putting tremendous pressure on banks' profit margins, especially for simple products that can be sold directly, such as savings, credit cards and motor insurance. Banks will have to re-invent themselves and reduce costs aggressively. One way to do this is to significantly scale back branch networks. Banks will also have to offer more choice and sell other people's products alongside their own to compete with the range the new businesses offer. The successful financial institution of the future will be like a mythical supermarket that devises a unique menu matched to your nutritional needs. As for the new internet banks, I expect that if they want to grow beyond offering simple products on a large scale, many will require substantial call centres and a number of investment centres. As with many internet businesses, over time the real beneficiary will not be the internet bank manager but us, the consumers. \u0095 Huw van Steenis, e-Finance Strategist at JP Morgan, has recently published Invasion Of The Customer Snatchers: Online Finance In Europe'.",

In case you've been on Mars recently, MP3 is a format for compressing music (eg, tracks from CDs) into smaller files that can easily be sent over the net and stored in portable devices. After the heavy metal anti-establishment, living on the edge, wild man had finished demanding that the US government ban MP3 exchange, he took legal action against Napster. </p> <p>Napster is a service that enables people to publish music files on their computers, making them available to anyone with a Napster client. Your computer tells Napster's computer what you have available so that when someone else uses their Napster client to search for something, your file shows up on their screen. They can choose to download it or not. </p> <p>Metallica \"won\". Napster was forced to delete the user names of the 335,000 users named by Metallica, leaving the miscreants no other choice than to log back in again with a new user name. </p> <p>While it's possible that The Man might go after one or two individual users to make an example of them (even Metallica's lawyer says it would be \"economically ridiculous\" to go after users) it would only be a gesture. </p> <p>There are Napster-like services springing up all over the place with Scour, Imesh and Gigabeat (to name but a few) coming on stream. </p> <p>The battle raging over MP3 has a wider context, because MP3 is a proxy for all digital content. </p> <p>This is why the assembled teams of expensive lawyers are taking the whole thing so seriously. </p> <p>But what can they do? Even if they are successful in preventing students from swapping MP3 files via Napster, worse nightmares await. Gnutella, which unlike Napster has no central server to go after, already has more files on its network thanNapster. Freenet, which combines similar distributed file management with strong cryptography, is coming together. </p> <p>Both of them implement a new kind of distributed system, far more interesting (and with far greater ramifi cations) than Napster. Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Netscape Communications and a former chief technology officer for AOL, has called Gnutella \"a benevolent virus\". </p> <p>Of real significance is the fact that both Gnutella and Freenet search for information and then provide it without telling where it came from. </p> <p>Gnutella software is both a client and a server - it's known as a servant, in fact, to distinguish it from both. It runs on someone's computer and communicates with a handful of other computers that pass information from one to another, which is why it is compared to a virus. </p> <p>So that every request for information doesn't have to traverse the entire Gnutella universe, the servants maintain a simple cache: if you've asked for information about MP3s, for example, other servants will pass any MP3 information that they recieve on to you. </p> <p>Freenet differs from Gnutella in that, as requests are satisfied, so the servants in the chain keep copies of the information (not just the \"pointer\" to it). This serves to spread data around the internet quickly and makes it effectively impossible to delete anything. </p> <p>Data gravitates closer to the point at which it is being used, or goes away. Freenet also searches for and identifies data by cryptographic \"hashes\" of keywords rather than the keywords themselves. </p> <p>So it's hard to find out what information is on a system or what anyone is looking for. </p> <p>The music industry, meanwhile, is hoping that Secure Rights Management (SRM) technologies will catch on. The idea here is that instead of MP3, consumers might be persuaded to use an alternative format. </p> <p>I can't see that there's much incentive to do this: why would a typical consumer buy music in a format that is restricted to their PC? </p> <p>Think of it this way. If CDs couldn't be copied on to tapes to listen to in the gym, or duplicated so that you can put a copy in the car but leave the original safe at home, or ripped into MP3 to listen to on your laptop, then would you buy more or less of them? </p> <p>Surely a great part of the utility of a CD (to me, anyway) is precisely that you can do things with it. The alternative to not being able to duplicate a CD for the car isn't buying another CD: it's listening to the radio instead. </p> <p>It seems to me that more books, and magazines exist now than did before the invention of the photocopier, and more people make a living from the music industry since the invention of the phono graph. (Imagine how scary it must have seemed to a performing artist a hundred years ago: oh no, people will never go to concerts again!) </p> <p>Perhaps, and it's only a suggestion, the content producers (whether bands, film makers, novelists or whatever) would be better off directly spending their money on exploring new business models than indirectly spending it (via their record company or publisher) on lawyers to defend the old ones. </p> <p>For example: why do record companies exist? Obviously they sign up and then promote talent, but one key reason why musicians need record companies is that they have no other means of getting paid. </p> <p>If, however, advances in micropayments and other technologies mean that artists can collect money directly from their audience then the record company is no longer part of the value network. </p> <p> Should it turn out that fans won't buy music at all - even for micropayments - and that revenues for future artists are to come from concerts, sponsorship and merchandising, then this is just as bad for the record companies because they would be wholly redundant. </p> <p>There is, frankly, no possibility of stopping the zero marginal cost of distribution of digital content over the net. </p> <p>Should content producers (ie artists) be worried about this? I rather think not: artists may find in future they will have to make most of their money from concerts, sponsorship and merchandising , but they will still make it. </p> <p>The people who should be worried are the content owners: their position in the value network is the one at risk.

E-crap like this is termed spam, after the Monty Python sketch where tinned meat somewhat dwarfs the rest of the menu. </p> <p>We've all done it: you log onto your email account and are told that you have five new messages. Excitedly, you start scanning the \"From\" headers. Disconsolate, you realise that it's all spam, spam, spam, spam - oh, and an email from your mum. </p> <p>Spotting spam is not tricky: it's usually from a temporary address to mask the sender, fhjskr373@hotmail.com, for example. The subject headline usually reads as though untold riches are just lying around waiting for you, eg: \"Haven't you made your e-millions yet?\" The worst are the kind that try and trick you into opening them using insultingly stupid methods. Jerry3228@yahoo.com was never really in with a chance the other day when he mailed me with the Subject: \"Here is that info John\" (although I think it's only fair to point out that this is written by someone idiotic enough to have opened the \"I Love You\" virus a few weeks ago). </p> <p>Even if you wanted to reply to these mass-mailing morons with a few choice expletives, it's usually impossible to reply since the email address has been banned pretty sharpish by an annoyed ISP. </p> <p>So who's sending it? Well, it's very hard to know, since no one ever tells you. Companies spam because it costs next to nothing, compared with the costs of junk snail-mail.

Every time you register on a site, (and the best sites often require this) you have to hand over an email address. Keep one email address free for sites like this, and only ever give that email address when out and about on the web. Keep a personal mail address just for friends and family, and you should see your spam mail reduced to a minimum. Give this address if you absolutely have to register new software too, since software companies are one of the major sources from which spammers \"harvest\" new addresses. </p> <p>If this sounds a little too much like giving in to the spammers, there are ways to be more proactive. Any email program worth its salt should offer you the option to filter your email. This means that you can divert email from any recognised spammers into its own folder that is regularly deleted. Both Hotmail and Yahoo offer filtering features, which will be a relief to anyone who has been away on holiday and comes back to find their inbox looking as overgrown as their garden. </p> <p>Filtering is tricky though, since setting general rules for which emails to filter can cause problems. For example, a lot of spam comes from Yahoo and Hotmail accounts. Ban anything from x@hotmail.com and you can kiss goodbye to emails from your mates too. I tried banning any emails with all capital letters IN THE TITLE, since that's the case many spammers use for their emails. Then I realised that that had included all the emails from my parents, who were writing in caps because they weren't sure how to change the size of their type. </p> <p>Microsoft has made it easy to block unwanted emails by adding a very easy-to-use feature. Tick the box by any spam mails, then click on \"Block sender\". Hotmail will automatically block all future emails from that address. This may not work too well in the long run, since spammers rarely use the same email address for very long. You could adopt the same tactic, of course, and take up a new email address every few months, but the hassle involved isn't usually worth it. </p> <p>If you really want to lay the smack down on the spammers, then there are ways you can get stuck in. If the email address it's sent from is an established ISP or web-based email company, then simply forward the spam along with a short complaint.

We can't promise that they'll transform England's squad into an irresistible combination of the best bits of Brazil's 70, Italy's 82 and France's 98 teams. But they just might make the whole Euro 2000 armchair experience slightly less stressful. </p> <p> <strong> 1 La-Z-Boy Oasis recliner (around \u00a31,600)</strong> <br> A real contender for the coolest gadget of the 21st century, the Oasis smart recliner - calling it an armchair is like describing Zinedine Zidane as a midfield plodder - is a must-have for Euro 2000. </p> <p>Owners won't have to worry about nipping to the fridge during the game as the Oasis features an integrated cool-box primed to house up to six cans of liquid refreshment. At half time they can discuss the finer points of Keegan's tactics with a friend by using its built-in phone. </p> <p>If a penalty shoot-out looms, they can prepare themselves for the inevitable by activating the six-point massage system.

It also comes with extra surround speakers and a special audio tweak that's designed to give your living room that Belgian big match atmosphere. It's so realistic you'll almost be able to smell the chips and mayonnaise. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Olympus Eye-Trek (around \u00a3700)</strong> <br> Chances are that just as you are about to hibernate in the living room for the footballing marathon, British summer time will finally arrive. </p> <p>Well, with the Olympus Eye-Trek glasses you can still watch Steve McManaman's mazy runs and top up your tan. A wireless sender transmits pictures from your TV set to the glasses within a range of about 30 feet. By our reckoning that's far enough for you to watch the game from your garden deckchair. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Roadstar LCD4004TFT (around \u00a3180)</strong> <br> Sadly, real life continues throughout Euro 2000 and, horror of horrors, there may come a point when you are not within sight of a TV as a crucial game is kicking off. Your secret weapon is this 4inch LCD TV from Roadstar. It's small enough to be accommodated by your briefcase but large enough to give you a fair idea of what's making fans jump up and down in the Low Countries. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Nokia 7110 phone (price dependent upon package)</strong> <br> Euro 2000 is the first major Wap football tournament, so expect to see lots of edgy looking football supporters glued to their phone screens on the train home. They'll be checking out the Football 365, (BT Cellnet) Sports.com (BT Cellnet), BBC (Vodafone) sites as well as emailing their views to fellow fans. There are Wappers in the England camp too as goal-scoring ace Michael Owen can email home using his Nokia 7110 phone. Vodafone is also offering standard phone owners a \"Footy on the Phone\" service which sends an SMS message every time their team scores a goal. </p> <p> <strong> 6 Panasonic NV-FJ710 (price around \u00a3300)</strong> <br> If you have to resort to recording the games, Panasonic's new VCR could prove very handy. It features an extended play model that squeezes up to 12 hours on to a standard E240 tape. As England only need to win five matches to reach the final, you'll be able to archive their glorious Euro 2000 campaign on to one tape and still have room for the EastEnders Omnibus. </p> <p> <strong> 7 Presents Direct Massage Pen (around \u00a320)</strong> <br> If England are three-nil down to Romania and Alan Hansen's half time analysis is giving you a headache - reach for this pen. Its vibrating tip will gently massage away your troubles, even if it won't do much for Kevin Keegan's. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Cucina Deluxe Blow- torch (around \u00a329.95)</strong> <br> This mini blowtorch is designed for Ainsley Harriot types to use in the kitchen for melting cheese, crisping a joint etc. However if John Motson utters something along the lines of \"and England's fate rests on this Gareth Southgate penalty\", you can use it to pre-empt your disappointment by flamb\u00e9ing the TV set. </p> <p><strong>Euro 2000 websites</strong></p> <p> <strong> The official site</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.euro2000.org\">www.euro2000.org</a> </p> <p> <strong>The England site</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.the-fa.org\">www.the-fa.org</a> </p> <p> <strong> The fan's site operated by The Football Supporter's Association</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.fsa.org.uk\">www.fsa.org.uk</a> </p> <p> <strong> Live commentary on many of the games</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio5live\">www.bbc.co.uk/radio5live</a> </p> <p><strong> A useful site with details of TV and radio coverage</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.totalfootball.co.uk/euro2000\">www.totalfootball.co.uk/euro2000</a> </p> <p> <strong> The alternative angle from the long-running footy fanzine</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.wsc.co.uk\">www.wsc.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> The Guardian's site, home to that oasis of footballing sanity, The Fiver</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk  \">www.footballunlimited.co.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> RoboMow</strong> </p> <p>The bad news: robots have started taking over the world. The good news: they're mowing lawns. Or at least, that's what the RL500, from Friendly Robotics, is designed to do, and more devices will follow. The company, which was founded in Israel in 1995, says it is its dream \"to one day make our robotic appliances as commonplace in the home as washing machines and dishwashers.\" The RL500 is a small robot powered by two 12v sealed lead-acid batteries, which are rechargeable. </p> <p>RoboMow uses RoboScan patented technology to find its way around with the help of an electric perimeter wire. Sensors prevent it from running into the family dog, though not vice versa. In fact, the only aggressive thing about the RL500 is the price. Friendly Robotics is selling machines in the UK for \u00a3499 inc VAT. Apparently people usually expect it to cost more. At that price, it may appeal not just to geeks with too much money but also to people with allergies or mobility problems and too much money. Friendly Robotics UK is based in Thame, Oxfordshire: phone 01844 261 653, email friendly@fr-uk.co.uk or see <a href=\"http://www.friendlyrobotics.com \">www.friendlyrobotics.com</a>. (JS) </p> <p><strong> Bluetooth begins to bite</strong><br> Just as you were getting over the hype for Wap (wireless application protocol) mobile phones, another flurry of techno spin is headed our way with the arrival of Bluetooth. </p> <p>Bluetooth is a new way to get electronic devices to talk to each other through the air. So it's bye, bye cables and hello seamless integration of mobiles, handheld organisers, laptops, desktop PCs and any other gadget which has the technology attached. </p> <p>Or so the story goes. </p> <p>It has taken three years of negotiations over the new standard to get to the stage where, this week, telecoms group Ericsson has unveiled \"the world's first Bluetooth-equipped mobile phone\", the T36. Ericsson promises you willbe able to do all sorts of useful things, like swap ring tones and play multi-player games, using the cutting-edge technology. </p> <p>Already announced is the company's first Bluetooth gadget - the funky looking cordless handset. Also available at the same time as the phone will be a Bluetooth PC card for laptops and a Bluetooth Home Base, which will switch your mobile phone from its cellular link to a landline connection when you're at home. That should help save on mobile bills and mean you need only one phone for all your calls. </p> <p>But you still shouldn't get too excited - the mobile won't be available until the end of the year. Worse, Erics son is refusing to even hint at what the price will be, so we can only assume it will be lots. </p> <p>Rest assured, however, that by the time Ericsson's first effort arrives there will be plenty more crowding the Bluetooth block. More than 1,900 companies, including all the big hardware manufacturers and the likes of Microsoft, have adopted the Bluetooth standard, and are developing their own products. </p> <p>It could make the flurry of Wap announcements earlier this year look like amateurs' day. (NM)</p> <p><strong> Worthy of note</strong><br> Having gone from a standing start to number two in the US notebook market, Sony is hoping to repeat its success in the desktop PC arena. Due to reach American stores later this month is a $1,000 Vaio branded machine that Sony is billing as a \"digital entertainment device.\" </p> <p>\"Even on the desktop, we continue to focus on entertainment rather than the pure computing applications,\" explained company president Fujio Nishida at a New York press conference last week. And to prove his point he described the new Vaios as being stuffed with music, video and internet software rather than business-style facilities. </p> <p>Sony has also teamed up with Palm to develop a series of personal organiser style products. These are scheduled to go on sale in the US in the autumn. </p> <p>There are no plans to launch either the desktop PCs or the personal organiser in the UK just yet. </p> <p>The company also announced its year end results with Sony Corp's sales up 15% on the previous year. Fujio Nishida credited the growth to the popularity of FD Trinitron WEGA TVs, Digital 8 Handycam camcorders, Digital Mavica cameras, DVD video players and Vaoi notebook personal computers. (AN)</p>",

      "bodyText": "RoboMow The bad news: robots have started taking over the world. The good news: they're mowing lawns. Or at least, that's what the RL500, from Friendly Robotics, is designed to do, and more devices will follow. The company, which was founded in Israel in 1995, says it is its dream \"to one day make our robotic appliances as commonplace in the home as washing machines and dishwashers.\" The RL500 is a small robot powered by two 12v sealed lead-acid batteries, which are rechargeable. RoboMow uses RoboScan patented technology to find its way around with the help of an electric perimeter wire. Sensors prevent it from running into the family dog, though not vice versa. In fact, the only aggressive thing about the RL500 is the price. Friendly Robotics is selling machines in the UK for \u00a3499 inc VAT. Apparently people usually expect it to cost more. At that price, it may appeal not just to geeks with too much money but also to people with allergies or mobility problems and too much money. Friendly Robotics UK is based in Thame, Oxfordshire: phone 01844 261 653, email friendly@fr-uk.co.uk or see www.friendlyrobotics.com. (JS) Bluetooth begins to bite Just as you were getting over the hype for Wap (wireless application protocol) mobile phones, another flurry of techno spin is headed our way with the arrival of Bluetooth. Bluetooth is a new way to get electronic devices to talk to each other through the air. So it's bye, bye cables and hello seamless integration of mobiles, handheld organisers, laptops, desktop PCs and any other gadget which has the technology attached. Or so the story goes. It has taken three years of negotiations over the new standard to get to the stage where, this week, telecoms group Ericsson has unveiled \"the world's first Bluetooth-equipped mobile phone\", the T36. Ericsson promises you willbe able to do all sorts of useful things, like swap ring tones and play multi-player games, using the cutting-edge technology. Already announced is the company's first Bluetooth gadget - the funky looking cordless handset. Also available at the same time as the phone will be a Bluetooth PC card for laptops and a Bluetooth Home Base, which will switch your mobile phone from its cellular link to a landline connection when you're at home. That should help save on mobile bills and mean you need only one phone for all your calls. But you still shouldn't get too excited - the mobile won't be available until the end of the year. Worse, Erics son is refusing to even hint at what the price will be, so we can only assume it will be lots. Rest assured, however, that by the time Ericsson's first effort arrives there will be plenty more crowding the Bluetooth block. More than 1,900 companies, including all the big hardware manufacturers and the likes of Microsoft, have adopted the Bluetooth standard, and are developing their own products. It could make the flurry of Wap announcements earlier this year look like amateurs' day. (NM) Worthy of note Having gone from a standing start to number two in the US notebook market, Sony is hoping to repeat its success in the desktop PC arena. Due to reach American stores later this month is a $1,000 Vaio branded machine that Sony is billing as a \"digital entertainment device.\" \"Even on the desktop, we continue to focus on entertainment rather than the pure computing applications,\" explained company president Fujio Nishida at a New York press conference last week. And to prove his point he described the new Vaios as being stuffed with music, video and internet software rather than business-style facilities. Sony has also teamed up with Palm to develop a series of personal organiser style products. These are scheduled to go on sale in the US in the autumn. There are no plans to launch either the desktop PCs or the personal organiser in the UK just yet. The company also announced its year end results with Sony Corp's sales up 15% on the previous year. Fujio Nishida credited the growth to the popularity of FD Trinitron WEGA TVs, Digital 8 Handycam camcorders, Digital Mavica cameras, DVD video players and Vaoi notebook personal computers. (AN)",

      "byline": "Hugo Young",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Tony Blair is New Labour's chef de cuisine. He alone sets the oven and measures the salt. He strives for meals of perfect balance. In his absence, the chief sous-chef began boiling up one of the ingredients too fast. So yesterday the leader set about turning down the gas under the pan, to restore the equilibrium that is the hallmark of his party's cooking. It may not have been wise to choose the massed ranks of the Women's Institute, an audience readily available for a Tory stunt, as the scene for the demonstration. But symmetrical blandness, on which nobody could choke, is safely back on the table.</p> <p>Gordon Brown had startled the appetite for something tastier. His attack on the Oxford entrance system reawakened intimations of class war. We learned quite a lot about New Labour in the process. The party, Brown thought, needed to be galvanised by the sight of one of its ministers remembering what they were for. He was loose with the facts, grotesquely defamatory of Magdalen College, but he made a point about social injustice and the persistence of unequal opportunities at the top of British society. There was something in what he said - in general, if not in particular. Briefly, we remembered that Labour cared about this sort of thing far more than the Tories.</p> <p>Blair's own recipe for Labour permits the occasional similar astringency. His dishes are not required to be insipid. Part of him - it's a part that boils away under the surface, and was what brought him into politics in the first place - abominates the forces of conservatism, and is not afraid to say so. His attack on them at the last party conference, which took friend and enemy aback, was both calculating and sincere. When talking to the party, both Blair and Brown think they have finished the task of educating it towards the right, and now wish to explain how this does not mean abandoning every element of the left.</p> <p>But there is a bigger audience. The meal is for wider consumption. The master culinarist was yesterday at his most unthreatening. The perfection of balance came close to being self-cancelling. Labour was new. But it was also old. The \"new\" was \"necessary in order to 're-new' the old\". History is good: \"We love British history, Britain's cultural heritage.\" But change is also good, while being in no way an obliteration of history, while at the same time again not being an affront to values that have to be considered timeless. Between history and change there was a false choice, Blair said. For New Labour, in fact, the harsher the choice, the falser it often seems to be.</p> <p>Where this speech did not verge on gobbledegook, it trod close to platitude. But it was indubitably inclusive. New Labour philosophy tries to square all the circles. The contemporary Blair opts to speak for \"values\", and especially \"community\"; to challenge materialism in the name of values, while doing nothing to worry materialists; to make the case for marriage without demonising the unmarried; to profess in favour of excellence, while scorning the elites that produce it; to be friends with everybody except the few - they really are quite few, even in the Tory party - who exhibit a belief in hierarchy or class prejudice. In addressing the country at large, there must be no abrasion, no enemy except rump and malign Tories, nothing to sting the palate.</p> <p>This, it should be said, is the genuine Blair. He believes a vast company of Brits can be swept into his tent, if only they hear what he says. Unlike Brown, he rejects most of the old lines that have divided societies and politics. He is therefore the epitome of the post-ideological leader. But it should also be noted how much of this is about positioning. It's about asserting ownership of the words that will strike the heartlands' chord without worrying middle England. And vice versa. This is a politics of tone and mood, of labels reducing the complexities of life to propositions that make things easy for everyone to understand which side they should be on.</p> <p>Blair is not alone in attending so closely to the politics of words. William Hague has found his own way of doing it. He's not so interested in being inclusive. His appeal is antagonistic. But he is developing his counter-demon to the forces of conservatism, namely the liberal elite. This, too, is all about positioning. Education was first in the frame: ruined, says Hague, by a group he can define, when challenged to identify it, only by saying: \"We know it when we see it.\" Other policies are about to follow schools into the dock where the liberalism of unnumbered decades is on trial. Immigration, welfare, and the NHS are being lined up for early speeches that attribute their defects to the soundbite label which new Conservatism has decided is most appealing.</p> <p>It's a remarkable charge. Swept within it are 18 years of Thatcherite responsibility for all these public services. Hague seems oblivious of the recent facts of history beneath the image he has seized on to exploit. Coming to modern times, we have a government in which two of the relevant ministers, Jack Straw and David Blunkett, are proud to declare in the most public places that they are not, and never have been, liberals. As for Tony Blair, the label would betray the borderless politics he has made his own. He does not use it. He proposes himself as a liberal no more often than he calls himself a socialist, which is to say never. But this is unimportant in the politics of mood, where impressions are regarded as all that matter. Labour is not a liberal elite, just as Magdalen College devotes itself to not being a social elite. But facts, in these political concoctions, are less important than convenient fantasies.</p> <p>What is the voters' defence against the dominance of positioning over reality, which is becoming the alpha and omega of political argument? Only to look at what is going on. Take the case where this began. Blair is, after all, the leader of a government, Brown his most important deputy. They are not opposition politicians, whose job is to rail against the state of things. Their job is to act. In three years, they've done little to address the problem that ignited Brown's rage over Magdalen. The availability of Oxford places to working-class students is much affected by money, which the government has taken away not handed out. It is also affected by belief: do the best students, from unfashionable schools, have the nerve to apply? The government has done little about that either, certainly much less than Oxford has. Now Brown's political attack guarantees that Magdalen will seem not more but less accessible.</p> <p>Likewise Hague. Positioning himself against a fantasy liberal elite doesn't build more schools or advance a concrete solution to the crime problems for which it is his scapegoat. The more these men ask us to consider the fine tuning, the calibrated cooking, of their words, the more we must ignore them.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

In his absence, the chief sous-chef began boiling up one of the ingredients too fast. So yesterday the leader set about turning down the gas under the pan, to restore the equilibrium that is the hallmark of his party's cooking. It may not have been wise to choose the massed ranks of the Women's Institute, an audience readily available for a Tory stunt, as the scene for the demonstration. But symmetrical blandness, on which nobody could choke, is safely back on the table. Gordon Brown had startled the appetite for something tastier. His attack on the Oxford entrance system reawakened intimations of class war. We learned quite a lot about New Labour in the process. The party, Brown thought, needed to be galvanised by the sight of one of its ministers remembering what they were for. He was loose with the facts, grotesquely defamatory of Magdalen College, but he made a point about social injustice and the persistence of unequal opportunities at the top of British society. There was something in what he said - in general, if not in particular. Briefly, we remembered that Labour cared about this sort of thing far more than the Tories. Blair's own recipe for Labour permits the occasional similar astringency. His dishes are not required to be insipid. Part of him - it's a part that boils away under the surface, and was what brought him into politics in the first place - abominates the forces of conservatism, and is not afraid to say so. His attack on them at the last party conference, which took friend and enemy aback, was both calculating and sincere. When talking to the party, both Blair and Brown think they have finished the task of educating it towards the right, and now wish to explain how this does not mean abandoning every element of the left. But there is a bigger audience. The meal is for wider consumption. The master culinarist was yesterday at his most unthreatening. The perfection of balance came close to being self-cancelling. Labour was new. But it was also old. The \"new\" was \"necessary in order to 're-new' the old\". History is good: \"We love British history, Britain's cultural heritage.\" But change is also good, while being in no way an obliteration of history, while at the same time again not being an affront to values that have to be considered timeless. Between history and change there was a false choice, Blair said. For New Labour, in fact, the harsher the choice, the falser it often seems to be. Where this speech did not verge on gobbledegook, it trod close to platitude. But it was indubitably inclusive. New Labour philosophy tries to square all the circles. The contemporary Blair opts to speak for \"values\", and especially \"community\"; to challenge materialism in the name of values, while doing nothing to worry materialists; to make the case for marriage without demonising the unmarried; to profess in favour of excellence, while scorning the elites that produce it; to be friends with everybody except the few - they really are quite few, even in the Tory party - who exhibit a belief in hierarchy or class prejudice. In addressing the country at large, there must be no abrasion, no enemy except rump and malign Tories, nothing to sting the palate. This, it should be said, is the genuine Blair. He believes a vast company of Brits can be swept into his tent, if only they hear what he says. Unlike Brown, he rejects most of the old lines that have divided societies and politics. He is therefore the epitome of the post-ideological leader. But it should also be noted how much of this is about positioning. It's about asserting ownership of the words that will strike the heartlands' chord without worrying middle England. And vice versa. This is a politics of tone and mood, of labels reducing the complexities of life to propositions that make things easy for everyone to understand which side they should be on. Blair is not alone in attending so closely to the politics of words. William Hague has found his own way of doing it. He's not so interested in being inclusive. His appeal is antagonistic. But he is developing his counter-demon to the forces of conservatism, namely the liberal elite. This, too, is all about positioning. Education was first in the frame: ruined, says Hague, by a group he can define, when challenged to identify it, only by saying: \"We know it when we see it.\" Other policies are about to follow schools into the dock where the liberalism of unnumbered decades is on trial. Immigration, welfare, and the NHS are being lined up for early speeches that attribute their defects to the soundbite label which new Conservatism has decided is most appealing. It's a remarkable charge. Swept within it are 18 years of Thatcherite responsibility for all these public services. Hague seems oblivious of the recent facts of history beneath the image he has seized on to exploit. Coming to modern times, we have a government in which two of the relevant ministers, Jack Straw and David Blunkett, are proud to declare in the most public places that they are not, and never have been, liberals. As for Tony Blair, the label would betray the borderless politics he has made his own. He does not use it. He proposes himself as a liberal no more often than he calls himself a socialist, which is to say never. But this is unimportant in the politics of mood, where impressions are regarded as all that matter. Labour is not a liberal elite, just as Magdalen College devotes itself to not being a social elite. But facts, in these political concoctions, are less important than convenient fantasies. What is the voters' defence against the dominance of positioning over reality, which is becoming the alpha and omega of political argument? Only to look at what is going on. Take the case where this began. Blair is, after all, the leader of a government, Brown his most important deputy. They are not opposition politicians, whose job is to rail against the state of things. Their job is to act. In three years, they've done little to address the problem that ignited Brown's rage over Magdalen. The availability of Oxford places to working-class students is much affected by money, which the government has taken away not handed out. It is also affected by belief: do the best students, from unfashionable schools, have the nerve to apply? The government has done little about that either, certainly much less than Oxford has. Now Brown's political attack guarantees that Magdalen will seem not more but less accessible. Likewise Hague. Positioning himself against a fantasy liberal elite doesn't build more schools or advance a concrete solution to the crime problems for which it is his scapegoat. The more these men ask us to consider the fine tuning, the calibrated cooking, of their words, the more we must ignore them. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

After a six month inquiry, Elizabeth France, data protection registrar, told the Labour party to advise members that their details were likely to be disseminated widely. She ruled that there was \"insufficent evidence to substantiate a prosecution against the campaign, or anyone acting on its behalf, in respect of non-registration\", after complaints that Mr Dobson unfairly received confidential information. The former health secretary's campaign used confidential information to send letters to Labour's 68,000 London members in his ill-starred fight against Ken Livingstone. Mr Dobson maintained that the details were legally supplied by two Euro MPs and at a late stage offered to supply them to Mr Livingstone and fellow challenger for the nomination, Glenda Jackson. The fact the campaign is over and the alleged abuse has ended is believed to have played a part in the decision. Failure to comply with data protection legislation to protect privacy carries a \u00a35,000 fine, and Mr Dobson's camp paid a \u00a375 licence fee as a \"precautionary\" measure after complaints were lodged. The ruling is expected to concentrate minds in the other main parties. Labour regularly sends membership lists to 650 constituency and 4,500 branch secretaries and to MPs and MEPs. Mr Dobson was alleged to have gained an unfair advantage by receiving information early on in the nomination battle deprived to his rivals.

He has not gone as far to say that the minutes should be fully released. Mr Wright pointed that such procedures could be prevented under at least five exemptions in the act - including preventing disclosure of any procedures in ministerial offices; discussions of public policy; and confidential communications between outside individuals and government.</p> <p>Lord Neill said that just two alone of these restrictions - the supply of information in confidence and discussions about public policy - created \" formidable obstacles\" to the introduction of his reforms.</p> <p>He went on to warn the prime minister that he expected the government to strengthen the language in the present ministerial code of conduct to make it clear that the PM and nobody else would carry the can for erring ministers, agreeing with Mr Wright's assertion \"that the buck stops here\".</p> <p>Citing but not naming the two scandals involving Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken, he pointed out that complaints to then prime minister John Major were merely passed to a minister to answer, who prompted denied them. \"We have to end this circularity,\" he said. Instead he suggested that in future cases the prime minsiter should appoint a lawyer or an accountant to carry out a confidential investigation. Lord Neill also expressed disappointment that the government had after five months failed to reply to a wide range of recommendations to reform Whitehall. \"Rapid changes are in train in the public service,and I believe that our recommendations - such as those relating to a civil service act, lobbying, special advisers and task forces - have an important role to play in sustaining public confidence that change is carried out with propriety.\"</p> <p>\"In our inquiry we concluded that there was a danger, not so much of politicising the civil service, as of marginalising neutral policy advice by bringing in a very siginifcant proportion of external advisers.\"</p> <p>Lord Neill said he wanted the government to at least start consultations on the need for a new civil service act. \"It would help to increase public confidence in the process of public sector reform, if, like most other democracies, this country could have legislation to clarify the role and status of the civil service.</p> <p>\"The government has supported such an act both in opposition and since taking office, but has not yet found time even to start the consultation process. We continue to find this disappointing.\"</p>",

Lord Neill, who made it clear that he was speaking in a personal capacity, backed up assertions by Tony Wright, Labour chairman of the committee, that his proposed reforms to open up secret contacts by lobbyists trying to influence government policy would be more or less scuppered by the new bill. Lord Neill's committee has called for Britain to follow the United States and Canada and keep public registers of meetings with lobbyists and for the talks to be fully minuted. He has not gone as far to say that the minutes should be fully released. Mr Wright pointed that such procedures could be prevented under at least five exemptions in the act - including preventing disclosure of any procedures in ministerial offices; discussions of public policy; and confidential communications between outside individuals and government. Lord Neill said that just two alone of these restrictions - the supply of information in confidence and discussions about public policy - created \" formidable obstacles\" to the introduction of his reforms. He went on to warn the prime minister that he expected the government to strengthen the language in the present ministerial code of conduct to make it clear that the PM and nobody else would carry the can for erring ministers, agreeing with Mr Wright's assertion \"that the buck stops here\". Citing but not naming the two scandals involving Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken, he pointed out that complaints to then prime minister John Major were merely passed to a minister to answer, who prompted denied them. \"We have to end this circularity,\" he said. Instead he suggested that in future cases the prime minsiter should appoint a lawyer or an accountant to carry out a confidential investigation. Lord Neill also expressed disappointment that the government had after five months failed to reply to a wide range of recommendations to reform Whitehall. \"Rapid changes are in train in the public service,and I believe that our recommendations - such as those relating to a civil service act, lobbying, special advisers and task forces - have an important role to play in sustaining public confidence that change is carried out with propriety.\" \"In our inquiry we concluded that there was a danger, not so much of politicising the civil service, as of marginalising neutral policy advice by bringing in a very siginifcant proportion of external advisers.\" Lord Neill said he wanted the government to at least start consultations on the need for a new civil service act. \"It would help to increase public confidence in the process of public sector reform, if, like most other democracies, this country could have legislation to clarify the role and status of the civil service. \"The government has supported such an act both in opposition and since taking office, but has not yet found time even to start the consultation process. We continue to find this disappointing.\"",

He is also charged with indecently assaulting three other women, two of them while they were held overnight in police cells while he was the custody sergeant on duty. Banfield has pleaded guilty to three charges of indecent assault against two of the women, the jury at Nottingham crown court heard yesterday.

Mr McGrory said a public inquiry would be better suited to protect witnesses from intimidation. He backed Mr Leckey's decision. Mr Leckey said in a statement he regretted his decision, but he believed there was no point in holding an inquest without the witnesses' testimony, because it would add little to evidence already in the public domain after a criminal trial last year. The statement issued on his behalf said: \"He is satisfied that their lives would be placed in danger if the evidence were to be given out, or placed in documentary form before an inquest.\" Mr Hamill died from head injuries in May 1997, 12 days after a 30-strong loyalist mob attacked him as he was walked home from a dance club used by Catholics.

We don't need to fight over every headline. We should put more faith in people's desire to engage in a conversation about the future.\"</p> <p>The prime minister said: \"At the heart of my beliefs is the idea of community. I don't just mean the local villages, towns and cities in which we live. I mean that our fulfilment as individuals lies in a decent society of others. My argument... is that the renewal of community is the answer to the challenges of a changing world.</p> <p>\"The way we do it is to combine the old and the new, traditional British values of responsibility and respect for others; with a new agenda of opportunity for all in a changing world...</p> <p>\"The world seems in a state of perpetual revolution. It is no wonder people feel insecure, frightened for their future.</p> <p>\"We all share the anxieties of today's world: the fear that our child will be bullied or worse offered drugs in the playground. The worry that children are exposed to too much sex and too much violence too young. The struggle of balancing work and family.</p> <p>\"Lives of honesty, struggle, decency, responsibility. People who have hopes for themselves and high hopes for their children. Lives that cry out for the helping hand of an active community, not the cold shoulder, the cruelty, of those who say 'you're on your own'. A community there for them when they need it, helping them cope with change, supporting their families, making sure their effort is rewarded.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair said these were \"good old British values\". But the spirit of the age was democratic. \"We won't rebuild community on the basis of doffing your cap or hierarchy. The rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate: it won't wash any more.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair distinguished between the \"genuine\" old-fashioned values that underpinned his parents' generation and \"attitudes and values we can safely leave behind\".

      "bodyText": "The message Tony Blair was trying to get over against the heckling of the Women's Institute yesterday was that Labour's passion for modernisation is not at odds with the popular love of tradition. He coupled this with a response to criticism of government control freakery when he said: \"We in government - and that means me - have to trust people more. We don't need to fight over every headline. We should put more faith in people's desire to engage in a conversation about the future.\" The prime minister said: \"At the heart of my beliefs is the idea of community. I don't just mean the local villages, towns and cities in which we live. I mean that our fulfilment as individuals lies in a decent society of others. My argument... is that the renewal of community is the answer to the challenges of a changing world. \"The way we do it is to combine the old and the new, traditional British values of responsibility and respect for others; with a new agenda of opportunity for all in a changing world... \"The world seems in a state of perpetual revolution. It is no wonder people feel insecure, frightened for their future. \"We all share the anxieties of today's world: the fear that our child will be bullied or worse offered drugs in the playground. The worry that children are exposed to too much sex and too much violence too young. The struggle of balancing work and family. \"Lives of honesty, struggle, decency, responsibility. People who have hopes for themselves and high hopes for their children. Lives that cry out for the helping hand of an active community, not the cold shoulder, the cruelty, of those who say 'you're on your own'. A community there for them when they need it, helping them cope with change, supporting their families, making sure their effort is rewarded.\" Mr Blair said these were \"good old British values\". But the spirit of the age was democratic. \"We won't rebuild community on the basis of doffing your cap or hierarchy. The rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate: it won't wash any more.\" Mr Blair distinguished between the \"genuine\" old-fashioned values that underpinned his parents' generation and \"attitudes and values we can safely leave behind\". The enduring values included good manners, respect for others, courtesy, giving up your seat for the elderly, saying please and thank you. Attitudes for jettisoning included his father's fierce opposition to his mother working. He reasserted education as Britain's No.1 priority. Referring to the debate about widening access to Oxbridge and other top universities, he said: \"Let's hear no more rubbish about class war, as if we had to choose between caricatures of Little Lord Fauntleroy or Karl Marx.

      "body": "<p>I was educated for a lifetime of painting my toenails. Yet this has not proved to be quite the disadvantage I once feared. It was disturbing to have to teach myself one of my A-levels. But academic knowledge is much easier to acquire than the public school confidence that Laura Spence was said to lack. It is this gilt on the gingerbread that drives men like Gordon Brown into paroxysms of envy, desire and despair. </p> <p>When I arrived at Oxford there must have been two or three times more state- educated men than there were women from any kind of school. But this didn't exactly leave me feeling crushed. I read \"minority\" as \"interesting\" or \"exclusive\" rather than \"insignificant\" or \"second tier\". And, after seven years locked up in a convent, I wanted to get down and party as soon as possible. In this I had two advantages over those who hadn't been at boarding school since early childhood. I wasn't paralysed by homesickness - and my social contacts weren't limited to one area of the country. </p> <p>The products of the major public schools are linked by formative experiences, blood, snobbery and ambition. We couldn't help but gravitate towards each other. I rapidly found myself part of a network of undergraduates that spanned the colleges. It was at least a year before I started to form friendships with people from a different background. Others never did, but I had at least one thing in common with those from less affluent families. Strange though it may seem, I had no money. I can't pretend that I am grateful for that. I would be happy not to have first-hand experience of how penury limits your options and leaves you debilitated by fear. </p> <p> However, if the poor little posh girl had to live off alternate meals of cabbage and porridge, she also felt at home drinking champagne in the quads at New College. For others the experience was a little uncomfortable and stayed so until the day came when they woke up to find they had changed from working-class children into upper-middle-class adults. The regional accent had gone (although I notice William Hague's seems to have come back again) and they had become strangers to their own parents. A friend from the north of England described to me how her family had come to see her after her final exams bearing a bottle of naff medium-sweet wine. Her first reaction was one of contempt for their poor taste. Her second was to despise herself for her reaction. </p> <p>My friend eventually went to work in London, delivered by the university with no obvious past before Oxford but a great future to follow it.

      "bodyText": "I was educated for a lifetime of painting my toenails. Yet this has not proved to be quite the disadvantage I once feared. It was disturbing to have to teach myself one of my A-levels. But academic knowledge is much easier to acquire than the public school confidence that Laura Spence was said to lack. It is this gilt on the gingerbread that drives men like Gordon Brown into paroxysms of envy, desire and despair. When I arrived at Oxford there must have been two or three times more state- educated men than there were women from any kind of school. But this didn't exactly leave me feeling crushed. I read \"minority\" as \"interesting\" or \"exclusive\" rather than \"insignificant\" or \"second tier\". And, after seven years locked up in a convent, I wanted to get down and party as soon as possible. In this I had two advantages over those who hadn't been at boarding school since early childhood. I wasn't paralysed by homesickness - and my social contacts weren't limited to one area of the country. The products of the major public schools are linked by formative experiences, blood, snobbery and ambition. We couldn't help but gravitate towards each other. I rapidly found myself part of a network of undergraduates that spanned the colleges. It was at least a year before I started to form friendships with people from a different background. Others never did, but I had at least one thing in common with those from less affluent families. Strange though it may seem, I had no money. I can't pretend that I am grateful for that. I would be happy not to have first-hand experience of how penury limits your options and leaves you debilitated by fear. However, if the poor little posh girl had to live off alternate meals of cabbage and porridge, she also felt at home drinking champagne in the quads at New College. For others the experience was a little uncomfortable and stayed so until the day came when they woke up to find they had changed from working-class children into upper-middle-class adults. The regional accent had gone (although I notice William Hague's seems to have come back again) and they had become strangers to their own parents. A friend from the north of England described to me how her family had come to see her after her final exams bearing a bottle of naff medium-sweet wine. Her first reaction was one of contempt for their poor taste. Her second was to despise herself for her reaction. My friend eventually went to work in London, delivered by the university with no obvious past before Oxford but a great future to follow it. I never asked her how she felt about this rebirth, but I do remember another woman worrying that the remnants of her Mancunian accent might deprive her of a job in the City. It seemed an absurd and completely unnecessary concern to me. But then Gordon Brown's belief that the Britain is being run by a secret ring of Bufton Tuftons seemed barking too - until I gave it further thought.

The received wisdom is that British companies are being prevented from pursuing legitimate cross-border tax planning, rather than tax avoidance or, heaven forfend, actually evading tax. </p> <p>The truth, of course, is a little more complex, as illustrated by the details on these pages indicating that Vodafone, having pulled off the biggest hostile bid the world has ever seen, was planning another quick corporate trick by directing the Mannesmann profit stream somewhere into the economic ether of Luxembourg or Dublin's self-styled International Financial Centre. </p> <p>Companies are under a duty to shareholders to minimise their tax payments, but they should also act responsibly towards the societies which constitute the markets for their goods. That is not a piece of corporate greenery, it is just good business sense. </p> <p><strong> Futures tense </strong><br> </p> <p> Those serving alcohol within and around the City of London know all about seasonal drinking habits. There's the February lull when professionals give the liver a rest (it's the shortest month) and there is the pre-Christmas rush of amateur imbibers, which can do serious damage to regular, ongoing trade. </p> <p>But the weather is rather less predictable, and as the bar and pavement table culture continues to grow in the Square Mile it has become a financial issue. So Corney &amp; Barrow, the City wine bar chain, has applied a bit of financial wizardry to the problem - buying a weather derivative hedge from Speedwell Weather Derivatives, a firm that is rather more used to doing work for energy firms. </p> <p>The use of derivatives in all shapes and sizes is expected to take another twist this morning when Liffe, the London international financial futures exchange, reveals more details about its plans to split its exchange business from the computer software operation which is growing up behind it. </p> <p>While there is some chatter that Liffe could float its exchange business on the stock market as a \"dot.com\", what is expected to happen more immediately is that Liffe signs up big users for its software. The idea appears to be that big companies - such as utilities which trade huge amounts of national resources between each other - could adopt the software to develop a more sophisticated trading environment through which they could auction their wares. </p> <p>Liffe looked close to death last year after losing much of its business to its German rival, Eurex. But we could be about to watch a dramatic, innovative, comeback. </p> <p><strong> Sum cheek </strong><br> </p> <p> So it's two cheers for open government then, as the statistics commission begins running its slide rule over some of the government's more sensitive pieces of data. A cheer for \"StatWatch's\" wide ranging brief including hospital waiting lists and class sizes and another for the promise to name and shame departments whose figures do not meet its test of integrity and independence. But no cheers for the decision by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, decision to keep control over the retail prices index. Why the RPI should be treated differently from every other economic statistic is baffling, as the Treasury select committee pointed out when the draft national statistics framework was published more than a year ago. </p> <p>The principle that ministers get to decide what comes under the commission's brief is still an affront, even though most have chosen to let auditors in. The focus now will be on the numbers which Labour set themselves up to be judged by - the New Deal, class sizes and waiting lists. Cynics may be forgiven for thinking they are happy to have outside scrutiny because they know they will meet their election pledges. A truly open government would let the statistics commission decide its own remit.</p>",

Companies are under a duty to shareholders to minimise their tax payments, but they should also act responsibly towards the societies which constitute the markets for their goods. That is not a piece of corporate greenery, it is just good business sense. Futures tense Those serving alcohol within and around the City of London know all about seasonal drinking habits. There's the February lull when professionals give the liver a rest (it's the shortest month) and there is the pre-Christmas rush of amateur imbibers, which can do serious damage to regular, ongoing trade. But the weather is rather less predictable, and as the bar and pavement table culture continues to grow in the Square Mile it has become a financial issue. So Corney &amp; Barrow, the City wine bar chain, has applied a bit of financial wizardry to the problem - buying a weather derivative hedge from Speedwell Weather Derivatives, a firm that is rather more used to doing work for energy firms. The use of derivatives in all shapes and sizes is expected to take another twist this morning when Liffe, the London international financial futures exchange, reveals more details about its plans to split its exchange business from the computer software operation which is growing up behind it. While there is some chatter that Liffe could float its exchange business on the stock market as a \"dot.com\", what is expected to happen more immediately is that Liffe signs up big users for its software. The idea appears to be that big companies - such as utilities which trade huge amounts of national resources between each other - could adopt the software to develop a more sophisticated trading environment through which they could auction their wares. Liffe looked close to death last year after losing much of its business to its German rival, Eurex. But we could be about to watch a dramatic, innovative, comeback. Sum cheek So it's two cheers for open government then, as the statistics commission begins running its slide rule over some of the government's more sensitive pieces of data. A cheer for \"StatWatch's\" wide ranging brief including hospital waiting lists and class sizes and another for the promise to name and shame departments whose figures do not meet its test of integrity and independence. But no cheers for the decision by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, decision to keep control over the retail prices index. Why the RPI should be treated differently from every other economic statistic is baffling, as the Treasury select committee pointed out when the draft national statistics framework was published more than a year ago. The principle that ministers get to decide what comes under the commission's brief is still an affront, even though most have chosen to let auditors in. The focus now will be on the numbers which Labour set themselves up to be judged by - the New Deal, class sizes and waiting lists. Cynics may be forgiven for thinking they are happy to have outside scrutiny because they know they will meet their election pledges. A truly open government would let the statistics commission decide its own remit.",

His message to Governor George W Bush is that this is one death warrant the world is going to hear about.</p> <p>From his cell on death row, Graham has just over two weeks to convince the American public he is an innocent man who has been denied a fair trial in the hope of forcing the Republican presidential contender to bestow clemency.</p> <p>But the statistics are discouraging. Since being elected in 1994, Mr Bush has granted one temporary reprieve, commuted one death penalty to life imprisonment, and signed 131 death warrants - a US record which has made Texas the execution capital of the western world.</p> <p>\"You're dealing with a factory here.

In recent years, DNA tests and fresh evidence have exonerated 87 death-row inmates and shaken many Americans' faith in US justice. Illinois has suspended its death penalty following a series of miscarriages of justice and a dozen states are considering following suit.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Texas, Governor Bush's confident assertion that the state has never executed an innocent man on his watch is coming under scrutiny, which is bound to intensify as Graham's execution date draws close.

And I've had some difficult moments. But you have to stay strong. You have to fight back,\" he said.</p> <p>Graham has had a long time to prepare for this moment.

In most of the US, that is not necessarily a barrier to execution.</p> <p><b> Close to execution</b><br> He has been on the brink of execution five times and once come within four hours before his sentence was postponed pending appeals. But he has no more appeals left to make. Last month, the US supreme court refused to hear his case, and any further judicial delays are highly improbable. Only clemency from the governor can save him now.</p> <p>As far as the prosecutors and much of the Texas press are concerned, Graham is just a habitual criminal trying to foment political unrest to escape the consequences of his actions. They point out that in his 19 years in jail, he has had more than 30 separate court proceedings.</p> <p>\"Actually, Graham's attorneys and diehard supporters should thank God for the American justice system providing due process and technical safeguards against swift punishment for condemned murderers,\" argued an opinion piece in the Houston Chronicle last month. \"Gary Graham has won court battles to stay alive, but he should lose the war.\"</p> <p>On closer examination, looking through the court records and talking to surviving witnesses, Graham's legal marathon represents not so much a guarantee of justice as a Kafka-esque labyrinth of legal quirks and absurdities. It raises troubling question about how the Texas system of justice sends prisoners to their deaths. No physical evidence tied Graham to the shooting of Bobby Lambert, a white suspected drug dealer, in a Safeway car park on a summer night in north-west Houston. There were no fingerprints, no murder weapon, no blood or residue on Graham's clothes.</p> <p>He was sentenced to death on the strength of the testimony of one woman, who witnessed the shooting. The witness, Bernadine Skillern, had told the police that the killer had a short \"afro\" and was clean shaven. She was shown 10 photographs, including one of Graham, who had been arrested for a string of armed robberies in which two people were injured. Out of the 10 mug shots, only Graham's came close to her description. The others had moustaches or bushy hair. According to the police report, Mrs Skillern said Graham resembled the murderer \"except the complexion of the suspect she saw was darker and his face was thinner\".</p> <p>The next day she was called into the police station and showed a lineup of five men including Graham. He was the only person to appear in both the photo spread and the lineup, so his face would have been familiar to her whether he had been at the scene of the crime or not. She identified him as the killer. Yet in the course of the two-day trial, the extraordinary nature of his identification went unchallenged. And his court-appointed lawyer, Ron Mock, failed to point out that there had been another witness at the police lineup, who did not identify Graham.</p> <p>His name was Ron Hubbard, a Safeway worker who had been rounding up supermarket trolleys in the car park when Lambert was shot, and came within a few feet of the gunman. \"He was about five foot five. He was a dark-skinned guy with a short afro, and a short, white, waist-length jacket,\" he said. \"He looked about the same size as my mother. I could look down on top of him.\"</p> <p>His description was echoed by Sherian Etuk, who was working on a Safeway cash register at the time of the killing. Both witnesses have seen photographs of Graham, who is five-foot ten, and are adamant he was not the man they saw. \"His face is too wide,\" Ms Etuk said. \"This guy had a narrow face and was really dark.\"</p> <p><b> Witnesses not called</b><br> The two witnesses were nearer to the scene of the shooting than Mrs Skillern but the jury never heard from them. Moreover, the prosecution told the jury (of 11 whites and one black) that Mr Lambert had been killed with a .22-calibre pistol, like the gun Graham had in his possession when he was arrested. But they were never told that a police ballistics test had ruled out his pistol as the murder weapon.</p> <p>During the past week, Mr Mock has failed to respond to a string of telephone requests to talk about his conduct in the Graham case and his failure to present exculpatory evidence. However, the investigator who worked with him on the case, Mervyn West, has shed some light on what happened. In an affidavit in 1993, Mr West testified: \"Ron Mock was extremely busy during the period of time that Gary's case was pending. Since we both assumed Gary was guilty, I decided not to waste time trying to substantiate his alibi. I really didn't think Gary had much hope, so I just went through the motions.\"</p> <p>Chester Thornton, Mr Mock's co-counsel in the original trial, said: \"I was shocked when I learned that the investigation that I believed had been done had not... I have serious concerns as to whether or not Gary Graham received effective assistance of counsel. As a member of the defence team, I consider myself partially responsible.\"</p> <p>Graham's representation at his first round of appeals was similarly inadequate. It was only in 1993, with a new set of lawyers that the witness and ballistics testimony was presented. But at a pivotal appeal at a Texas state court that year, the judge turned down the request for a new evidentiary hearing. Richard Burr, Mr Graham's current lawyer, is certain the judge never even read the defence case. Only a few hours before his ruling, the judge had told one of Mr Burr's colleagues he had not had time to look at it.</p> <p>\"I find it difficult to continue to work in a system which cannot do the most elemental thing that justice requires - a full hearing of the evidence,\" Mr Burr said. \"In Gary Graham's case, no court has ever done that.\"</p> <p>Every time a prisoner at the Terrell Unit is executed the details of his final meal are posted on a state website. Gary Graham has been asked to choose his meal five times already and each time he has refused. This time he will do the same; accepting the meal is like accepting their justice, he said. \"I'm not going to play their game,\" he said.</p> <p>Whether he plays or not, this game is approaching its end. His execution may add to the deepening unease around the country and perhaps even help galvanise a fundamental reassessment of the system. But by then, of course, it will be too late for Gary Graham.</p> <p>Top 10 execution states since Jan 17 1995, when Governor George W Bush took office in Texas:</p> <p><b> State</b> Number of executions</p> <p><b>Texas </b> 131 <br> <b>Virginia </b> 52 <br> <b>Missouri </b> 31 <br> <b>Oklahoma </b> 23 <br> <b>South Carolina </b> 20 <br> <b>Arizona </b> 18 <br> <b>Arkansas </b> 13 <br> <b>Florida </b> 13 <br> <b>Alabama </b> 13 <br> <b>Illinois </b> 10<br></p>",

In an affidavit in 1993, Mr West testified: \"Ron Mock was extremely busy during the period of time that Gary's case was pending. Since we both assumed Gary was guilty, I decided not to waste time trying to substantiate his alibi. I really didn't think Gary had much hope, so I just went through the motions.\" Chester Thornton, Mr Mock's co-counsel in the original trial, said: \"I was shocked when I learned that the investigation that I believed had been done had not... I have serious concerns as to whether or not Gary Graham received effective assistance of counsel. As a member of the defence team, I consider myself partially responsible.\" Graham's representation at his first round of appeals was similarly inadequate. It was only in 1993, with a new set of lawyers that the witness and ballistics testimony was presented. But at a pivotal appeal at a Texas state court that year, the judge turned down the request for a new evidentiary hearing. Richard Burr, Mr Graham's current lawyer, is certain the judge never even read the defence case. Only a few hours before his ruling, the judge had told one of Mr Burr's colleagues he had not had time to look at it. \"I find it difficult to continue to work in a system which cannot do the most elemental thing that justice requires - a full hearing of the evidence,\" Mr Burr said. \"In Gary Graham's case, no court has ever done that.\" Every time a prisoner at the Terrell Unit is executed the details of his final meal are posted on a state website. Gary Graham has been asked to choose his meal five times already and each time he has refused. This time he will do the same; accepting the meal is like accepting their justice, he said. \"I'm not going to play their game,\" he said. Whether he plays or not, this game is approaching its end. His execution may add to the deepening unease around the country and perhaps even help galvanise a fundamental reassessment of the system. But by then, of course, it will be too late for Gary Graham.

      "bodyText": "The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is poised to broaden his campaign to isolate the US over its divisive missile shield scheme with a flurry of moves in the next week aimed at enlisting European public opinion in the battle against America's National Missile Defence (NMD) project. For the first time in more than a year, Russia's defence minister, Igor Sergeyev, travels to Brussels today for talks with Nato leaders, a relationship that the Russians severed last year in protest at the war in Yugoslavia. Mr Sergeyev is expected to put some flesh on the bones of Mr Putin's calls for joint development of anti-missile defences by the US, Nato and Russia, although the Russian proposals appear vague - more political and diplomatic than military. After clashing with President Bill Clinton over the \"son of star wars\" scheme at a Moscow summit at the weekend, Mr Putin promptly went to Rome where he called for joint expansion of missile defence to cover all of Europe and Russia as well as America. On his first official trip to Berlin next week Mr Putin is expected to step up the propaganda war against NMD, seeking to exploit European differences with the Americans on the issue. NMD \"is viewed negatively not just by Russia, but also by France, Germany and Italy\", said Colonel-General Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of Russia's strategic missile forces. The ghost of Greenham Common has suddenly returned to haunt the arms control agenda, in what is perceived as the biggest threat to strategic stability in 20 years. But the big differences from the battles of the 1970s and 80s are that Russia lost the cold war and does not constitute the threat then posed by the Soviet Union, while Helmut Schmidt's and Helmut Kohl's firm siding with the US then is not now replicated by the Berlin government of Social Democrats and Greens. \"What Putin is trying to do is play the European card, but he's also anxious not to confront the US,\" said Pavel Podvig, a researcher at Moscow's Centre for Arms Control Studies. Experts are sceptical about Mr Putin's alternative proposals, which centre on tactical rather than strategic missile defences, using modernised rockets to destroy \"rogue state\" ballistic missiles shortly after launch. This would comply with the 1972 US-Soviet anti-ballistic missiles treaty which Russia wants to preserve, whereas the US scheme to destroy incoming missiles in space requires withdrawal from or changes in the treaty. However, European defence sources say the technology behind Mr Putin's proposal was even more complicated and uncertain than the NMD project. A breakdown of negotiations and unilateral American ditching of the ABM treaty could, warned Gen Yakovlev, turn strategic stability into \"utter unpredictability\". \"The whole system of nuclear arms control will change,\" he told the Moscow newspaper Kommersant. The Russian national security elite believes the US talk of ballistic missile threats from rogue states like North Korea is nonsense, but Mr Putin made a crucial concession at the weekend summit by admitting that there is such a threat. \"From a position of opposing missile defence absolutely, Mr Putin is now saying missile defence is good as long as Russia is part of the club. But the Russian military does not want that,\" said Mr Podvig. The shift has rattled China which feels vulnerable to the US plan and was counting on Moscow as an ally. China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said on Tuesday that adherence to the ABM treaty \"conforms with the strategic balance and stability\". \"Any efforts to amend the ABM treaty or to withdraw from the ABM treaty would not only threaten the nuclear disarmament process but would also shatter the basis for nuclear non-proliferation and will give rise to a new arms race, including an arms race in outer space,\" she said. In Moscow at the weekend, Strobe Talbott, the US deputy secretary of state, said that Mr Putin's alternative proposals could be discussed, but only to supplement and not supplant NMD, since the North Korean challenge was too urgent and the Russian scheme would take too long to develop. \"The world covered by the ABM treaty changed very vividly on August 31 1998 when the North Koreans fired that missile,\" he said. \"Can the ABM treaty, can the US-Russian strategic relationship, change to take account of those new realities?\" However, America's Nato allies - including senior officials in Britain's Ministry of Defence - remain deeply sceptical about the US plan for a national missile shield.

The silence was broken by a deafening explosion as a suicide bomber blew himself up in Ratmalana, instantly killing the industrial development minister, C V Gunaratne. The minister died as he mingled with crowds during his party's procession to mark War Heroes Day honouring soldiers killed in the long-running war against the Tamil Tigers, who are fighting for a separate homeland in the north of the country. At least 60 people were injured, 15 of them seriously, in the blast, said Dr W G Gunawardena, a director at the hospital where the casualties were taken. The minister's wife was also critically injured in the blast and was being operated on, he said. \"I heard a huge explosion and then saw parts of bodies flying around.

The clergy are being offered \"practical guidelines\" to develop healing ministries in their parishes with the instruction that healing the sick is a gospel imperative.

The booklet offers practical advice as well as spiritual guidance, suggesting safety tips such as that healing should always take place on a carpet in case the patient falls to the floor so that they do not injure themselves. Miracles are not ruled out by the Church of England but the report advises that those who think they are cured should go on taking their medication just in case. Clergy are told that the role of tender loving care should not be ignored in spiritual ministrations. The report, produced by a working party including senior clergy, theologians, psychiatrists and doctors, is the first guidance of its sort that the church has issued for 42 years. The Rt Rev John Perry, Bishop of Chelmsford, who chaired the group, said: \"There is nothing predictable in the ministry of healing except the assurance of God's love and care.

Similarly it was cautious about miracles without ruling them out altogether: \"We seem to be moving towards the view that, whatever happened in the past, today God does not normally work through that which can be defined as miraculous. \"A Christian may claim to have experienced a miracle and if the experience strengthened their faith, that claim should be treated with respect.

Mr Wood, 51, said: \"When we tried to phone through the advert we were stopped in our tracks after uttering the word 'hardworking' and they told us: 'You can't put that, it's discrimination'. When we asked if we could put enthusiastic, she said we couldn't use that either.\" Earlier, Mr Blunkett said the case was a nonsense. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had \"sorted\" the row. \"I've fought gesturism all my life and I will continue to do so,\" he added.",

It even recognised the \"sculptural\" qualities in Jeff Wall's photographs. </p> <p>Now it has an exhibition of marble dogs. This is sculpture. Figures on plinths. Statues, even. Exquisitely carved bodies. Taut marble skin. Rippling icy muscles. </p> <p>Hounds in Leash: the Dog in 18th- and 19th-century Sculpture collects some of the most amazingly opulent monuments the rich once erected to their pets. Memories of their doggies weren't enough. </p> <p>If you were Serpent, \"a favourite dog of Lady Stepney's\", which died in 1750, you were far more likely to be immortalised in art than the rural workers who appear as faceless smudges in the background of 18th-century landscape paintings.

      "bodyText": "The Henry Moore Institute, a \"centre for the study of sculpture\", has the tricky job of relating the old idea of sculpture to the way art happens now. Under its late director Robert Hopper it used the world \"sculpture\" to describe cut and manipulated felt by Robert Morris. It even recognised the \"sculptural\" qualities in Jeff Wall's photographs. Now it has an exhibition of marble dogs. This is sculpture. Figures on plinths. Statues, even. Exquisitely carved bodies. Taut marble skin. Rippling icy muscles. Hounds in Leash: the Dog in 18th- and 19th-century Sculpture collects some of the most amazingly opulent monuments the rich once erected to their pets. Memories of their doggies weren't enough. If you were Serpent, \"a favourite dog of Lady Stepney's\", which died in 1750, you were far more likely to be immortalised in art than the rural workers who appear as faceless smudges in the background of 18th-century landscape paintings. Serpent had his likeness carved on top of a classical pedestal with a verse celebrating his happiness in the love of his \"mistress true\". No blurred anonymity, either, for Maida, the famous highland greyhound that belonged to Walter Scott. The novelist's dog was made to pose so frequently for artists that it was said he used to run away whenever he saw a pencil.

      "body": "<p>Forget England v Germany - the real Euro 2000 contest is being fought out on virtual turf between BBC1 and ITV. The two main terrestrial broadcasters go head to head with their coverage of the tournament - and, for once, without pesky intervention from Sky Sports - to become the channel of choice for the viewing millions. Obviously, they're wheeling out the big guns for this TV derby; the BBC boasts a huge \"battle bus\" containing an entire broadcasting facility that can travel between grounds, while ITV is fielding some tasty new graphics packages to keep us on the edge of our seats. </p> <p>But how much difference can these trappings really make? Because however they dress it up, both channels are stuck with the same basic feed from the host broadcasters, a combination of Belgian and Dutch TV stations. The matches themselves are carved up fairly evenly between BBC1 and ITV, but when it comes to those few occasions when both are showing the same match live, what's to choose between them? There has to be more to this than a straightforward Lineker/Lynam grudge fight. </p> <p>Ultimately, the only area in which BBC1 and ITV can compete is in the way they dress up the \"dirty feed\" from the host broadcasters. And that comes down, basically, to studio presentation and the all-important graphics. ITV promises \"cutting edge graphics\" from the \u00a3250,000 Everest package, which allows them to generate seemingly three-dimensional images on screen. These can be anything from boxes that hold the commentator's name through to drop-down menus full of statistics, or little clocks that announce \"Goal\" when occasion demands. </p> <p>\"They won't scream 'Goal! Goal! Goal!' like they do on Sky,\" says Rick Waumsley, executive producer of ITV's Euro 2000 coverage. \"We'd like to think that our coverage is a bit more restrained than that. You won't be blitzed with thousands of statistics popping up all over the screen and getting in the way of the match itself. But I'd like to think that our graphics will give it a more modern, brighter, streamlined appearance, without clashing with the basic feed.\" </p> <p>As well as eye-popping moulded graphics, ITV will also wheel out the mighty ORAD machine - the gizmo that allows them to grab an image from the field and translate it into a virtual image. This is particularly useful for possible offsides, or for assessing whether the ball went over the line; it's also fun for recreating spectacular moments. \"We used it to demonstrate a couple of Ryan Giggs's wondergoals against Arsenal,\" says Waumsley. \"You can track the player running up the field, with lines in front of him or behind him to indicate where he's going. Obviously with a piece of kit like this it's tempting to go mad, but we use it only when it's really necessary.\" </p> <p>The BBC, however, has dispensed with such measures. According to ITV's Waumsley, the BBC sports department bought an ORAD machine but never used it and eventually sold it. \"There's a danger of style winning out over content,\" says Paul McNamara, executive producer for BBC1's Euro 2000 coverage. \"If you go into a clever graphic, you're left at the end having to drop back into the host feed, and they could be doing absolutely anything. It's not going to look seamless. </p> <p>\"And of course there's always the danger that while you're getting busy with your graphics, you miss the actual goal. If we had the luxury of 20 of our own cameras at the side of every ground, then maybe we could go down that road, but out in Belgium and the Netherlands we don't have the necessary degree of control. We thought long and hard about doing digital reconstructions for Euro 2000, and in the end we decided not to. It would just be TV for TV's sake.\" </p> <p>The choice, then, seems simple enough: BBC1 for the no-frills coverage, plus Gary Lineker, Alan Hansen and roving reporter Johann Cruyff; ITV for a souped-up version with bright, sparkly graphics plus Des Lynam, Bob Wilson and Gabby Yorath. You might expect a more aggressive rivalry between the two channels - but the enforced truce seems more a result of limited opportunity than a sudden outbreak of amicability. Each broadcaster can only squeeze a couple of their own cameras into each ground, and they'll be busy customising the coverage for British audiences. If Prince Charles or Victoria Beckham turns up at the ground, they'll follow them; if an English player does something of special interest to domestic viewers, they can zoom in. Short of mutual sabotage, there's little else they can do. </p> <p>As the big sporting fixtures float off to other broadcasters, this may be one of the last times that BBC1 and ITV have the chance to compete so directly over what is basically identical coverage. If England are knocked out at an early stage, both will be relying on their presentation style to keep viewers tuning in to their particular matches. When it comes to the final, which both channels cover live, viewing decisions will be made on which style we've learned to love more. But with so little room to manoeuvre, it may come down to a straightforward battle of the pundits after all.</p>",

An essay is due on the Women's Institute's journey from tea and jumble sales to activism and in-your-face conviction.</p> <p>But a more pressing subject has to be addressed: something is going wrong with this government. Friends of Labour will hope this is only a bad case of mid-term blues, but the patient is looking very peaky. Since the Millennium Dome chaos of New Year's eve, the government has endured six months of persistent misfortune. A flu crisis exposed the creakiness of the NHS; a stand-off with Ken Livingstone held up for public view the control-freakery of the Labour machine. The Conservative opposition, for more than two years the invisible men of British politics, began to make an impact. William Hague's interventions on asylum and crime have been crude, but they have landed punches. Unhappily, the last fortnight's debate on elitism seems to have lost Labour more friends than it has won. What it all adds up to is the sense that the winning coalition put together by Tony Blair in 1997 is coming apart - with middle Britain fleeing the New Labour tent in droves. Yesterday's scenes in Wembley Arena - replayed on television and relished in this morning's newspapers - have now given that feeling its signature image. According to Mr Hague, Mr Blair has abandoned Middle Britain and yesterday came proof that Middle Britain is abandoning him.</p> <p>Of course there are specific circumstances. The WI women may not have been annoyed at Mr Blair's message so much as his effrontery in delivering it at all: they do not like party-political harangues and they do not like to be used as backdrops for the TV news. The PM should have judged his audience better. What he served up yesterday - long catalogues of spending figures and policy targets - did not fit the bill at all.</p> <p>There are two questions which Downing Street should now ponder. The first is the message. Yesterday's speech was simply not good enough; it lacked the intellectual coherence to qualify as the mission statement it clearly purported to be. There was some reheated communitarianism, but that idea always falls at the same hurdle: everyone likes community, but how exactly can we foster more of it? Besides, the speech failed to make the link between \"community\" and the battery of government programmes Mr Blair dutifully listed.</p> <p>The connection between opportunity and responsibility did not come off either. It is clear why, politically, Mr Blair would want to invoke both - balancing left and right - but he failed to make an intellectual bridge between the two. Equal opportunity is a good rallying cry, but it needs much sturdier thought if it is to become the logical thread which ties together the assorted elements of the government's activity.</p> <p>The second query relates to the messenger. For six years Labour has held Mr Blair to be the unassailable asset, the supreme leader whose healing balm can be made to assuage any situation, no matter how tricky. His reception yesterday suggests that the Blair effect no longer applies. He does not walk on water; he has to swim in it along with politics' lesser mortals - and swim hard.</p>",

There was some reheated communitarianism, but that idea always falls at the same hurdle: everyone likes community, but how exactly can we foster more of it? Besides, the speech failed to make the link between \"community\" and the battery of government programmes Mr Blair dutifully listed. The connection between opportunity and responsibility did not come off either. It is clear why, politically, Mr Blair would want to invoke both - balancing left and right - but he failed to make an intellectual bridge between the two. Equal opportunity is a good rallying cry, but it needs much sturdier thought if it is to become the logical thread which ties together the assorted elements of the government's activity. The second query relates to the messenger. For six years Labour has held Mr Blair to be the unassailable asset, the supreme leader whose healing balm can be made to assuage any situation, no matter how tricky. His reception yesterday suggests that the Blair effect no longer applies. He does not walk on water; he has to swim in it along with politics' lesser mortals - and swim hard.",

Ms Yates was present at the high court in London to hear her solicitor, Anthony Burton, tell Mr Justice Eady that she had suffered \"serious injury to her reputation\" and had been \"caused acute hurt, distress and embarrassment\" by publication of the allegations - taken from a book about Mr Hutchence - in the Mail on Sunday last year. Mr Burton said Ms Yates, a celebrity \"best known as a television presenter and author\" was the partner of Mr Hutchence, lead singer with rock group INXS, from 1994 until his death in November 1997. On July 22 1996 the couple had a child, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily. Mr Burton told the court that the allegations were published in the Mail on Sunday's Night and Day magazine on April 11 last year in the first of two serialisations from a book entitled Michael Hutchence, written by Vince Lovegrove and published in Australia. It was alleged, he said, that \"Paula Yates deceitfully and without the knowledge of her partner Michael Hutchence deliberately became pregnant by him in order to entrap or ensnare him into a permanent relationship\". It was also alleged that she then \"tried to cover up what she had done by deceitfully and tastelessly creating and giving publicity to a false story after Mr Hutchence's death that they had had fertility treatment to conceive their child\". The defendant, Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, \"published the serialisation of Mr Lovegrove's book in reliance on a warranty from Faber &amp; Faber, the book's English publisher that the matters contained in it were true.

Ms Yates's principal concern was to show that Tiger was a wanted baby, he said. Liz Hartley, solicitor for Associated Newspapers, told the judge: \"The newspaper agreed to publish a two part serialisation of Mr Lovegrove's book on the understanding that the matters contained within [it] were true and capable of legal proof.\" The newspaper accepted that the \"allegations are untrue and should never have been published and apologises to the claimant\".

Well, no actually. At the heart of the work is the relationship between Coriolanus and his destructive mother, Volumnia. In Coriolanus Shakespeare covered a subject that keeps many a therapist in business - an obsessive love between mother and son that leads to the destruction of both. </p> <p>How and why did she produce this angry young man convinced of his own invincibility, off to battle at the drop of a hat, but who hangs on her every word, while his wife is merely \"my gracious silence\"? For Jonathan Kent, who is directing the Almeida production, the key to understanding Coriolanus is Volumnia. </p> <p>\"She has created this killing machine who has an almost Pavlovian response to battle and bloodshed. But at the end, in persuading him on a course of action that will eventually lead to his death, she destroys him, and she knows she's doing it,\" he says. </p> <p>According to Kent, Volumnia is a strong woman who survives in a male society by adopting all the masculine virtues. In Barbara Jefford, one our most experienced Shakepeareans, Kent has found a sparkling Volumnia. \"She would have made a great soldier herself,\" Jefford says, \"but lives vicariously through her son. He is her life and there is an almost unnatural love between them - she is totally fulfilled by him. He is her work of art.\" </p> <p>Volumnia may be considered the baddie - she even encourages her young grandson to crush butterflies - but Jefford does not share that view. \"I wouldn't call her evil. She doesn't incite people to murder, like Lady Macbeth, say. She's so obsessed with her son that she might be considered unbalanced, but that's what makes her fascinating.\" </p> <p>Jefford explains: \"I suppose one could say it's a one-parent family. Her husband, a soldier, was killed while her son was very young. As soon as he was old enough to hold a sword he was in battle, not just playing soldiers. He has to die to save his homeland and she knows that, but she persuades him to do the 'right' thing. I feel it is the only thing she can do.\" </p> <p>It is strange that Shakespeare examined the mother-son dynamic only in this play. Jefford points out that Shakespeare wrote Coriolanus at the time of his mother's death. \"We have no way of knowing what she was like, or how he felt about her - but that's interesting, don't you think?\" </p> <p>Jefford, now 59, has appeared in 52 Shakespearean productions. She made her debut as Isabella in Measure for Measure, opposite John Gielgud, and was part of the postwar golden age at Stratford with Michael Redgrave, Peggy Ashcroft and Anthony Quayle. After stints at the Old Vic and National Theatre, in films and TV, Jefford returned to Stratford 11 years ago, where she played Volumnia opposite Charles Dance. </p> <p>\"It's a chance you don't often get,\" Jefford says. \"To be able to go back to a role after a decade is just marvellous. You know what works, but having lived that bit more, you do have a new take on the role.\" </p> <p>She has also played Fiennes's mother before, in Six Characters in Search of an Author, at the National in 1987, and admires his work. \"I like his straight-down-the-line approach. It think it's how all great actors work.\" </p> <p>Jefford is unusually busy for an actress of her age, but while Hollywood and television may cast aside older actors, in the Shakespeare scene it's a positive boon to have packed a few years in. </p> <p>\"I'm far too old to play Volumnia really, but you can only play Shakespeare when you have reached a certain stage of technical expertise. So often you will see performances by very young actors who look divine, but then they open their little traps, and you think, 'Oh dear.' \" </p> <p>It is also true that Shakespeare almost has to be age-blind, partly because no teenage actress could play, say, Juliet with any great acting expertise, and partly because the roles require some experience of life. \"The last time I played Portia I was 43, having played her in my 20s and 30s,\" says Jefford. \"I think I was better at it when I was older. </p> <p>\"And I'm not so frightened now. It's strange: when you're young you don't have nerves because you don't know what the pitfalls are. Then the more you do, the more is expected of you. But now I'm more confident. I know I can do certain things and I'm not stuck in a rut.\" </p> <p>Which would explain her latest film, Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate, in which she plays a rather bizarre role, a scientist complete with withered arm, wheelchair and mittel-European accent. </p> <p>Most actors would rush to work with Polanski, but Jefford first turned the role down, saying she was too busy. \"Then Polanski himself rang me. It was like that Pete 'n' Dud sketch: 'It's only that bloody Roman Polanski on the phone.' It seemed rude not to, so I was on the set within a couple of days.\" </p> <p>She found it good fun, but has been around long enough to see through Polanski's wiles. \"It seemed to me that he would put aside a day for his tantrums. It's transparent that it's drummed up, but he still does it.\" </p> <p>Does she now feel able to upbraid a difficult director? \"Oh no. In films I still feel that I'm way behind, having done my first at the age of 36. As for theatre, I honestly haven't worked with a difficult director for years, but then age does command some sort of respect. They don't make you their whipping boy because the company would rise up and say, 'How dare you be nasty to Bar?' \" </p> <p>Like Gielgud, Jefford wants to work until her last breath. \"I feel it's like food and drink - it's part of one's existence. I know a lot of people reach a stage where it isn't as gripping as it used to be. But it's nice to go on showing off a bit, because that's what actors are in it for really.\" </p> <p>Coriolanus is in rep at the Gainsborough Studios, London N1 (020-7359 4404), from Wednesday till August 5.</p>",

He will be questioned over the coming days, a spokesman said.</p> <p>Mr Vigne has strongly denied any part in the death of his wife who, with her record bust - measured at 54G by the Guinness Book of Records - became a cult figure in Britain as the co-presenter of Channel 4's Eurotrash programme.</p> <p>\"When I devoted my time to stopping my wife committing suicide, I got called a pimp,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Now they're going to try to tell me I didn't do enough to save her. They're hard to bear, all these suspicions.

      "bodyText": "French police investigating the death of Lolo Ferrari, the surgically-enhanced actress, singer and Channel 4 television presenter best known as the woman with the largest breasts in the world, yesterday arrested her husband. Ferrari, a one-time porn star who underwent more than 30 operations to transform her face and body, was found dead in early March at her home in the south of France. She was known to be taking large quantities of antidepressants and an initial autopsy concluded she died from an overdose of prescription drugs. Police in Grasse arrested Eric Vigne, 52, her husband and manager of 13 years, on suspicion of failing to assist a person in danger. He will be questioned over the coming days, a spokesman said. Mr Vigne has strongly denied any part in the death of his wife who, with her record bust - measured at 54G by the Guinness Book of Records - became a cult figure in Britain as the co-presenter of Channel 4's Eurotrash programme. \"When I devoted my time to stopping my wife committing suicide, I got called a pimp,\" he said. \"Now they're going to try to tell me I didn't do enough to save her. They're hard to bear, all these suspicions. Why would I kill my reason for existing?\" His lawyer, Serge Pautot, said many people could be charged with failing to help Ferrari: \"Her husband, certainly, who shared her life and managed her career, but also the doctors, surgeons and psychiatrists who may have poorly evaluated the impact on her of her operations, her career and her dependence on drugs.\" Born Eve Valois, Lolo Ferrari grew up in a middle-class family in the chic Breton resort town of La Baule. In interviews before she died, she said her gradual transition into a cruelly inflated Barbie doll was inspired by a desire to escape a cruel mother and deeply unhappy childhood. Her breasts, designed by an aircraft engineer, each contained three litres of surgical serum. She had to wear a specially constructed bra day and night, could not sleep on her stomach or back because their weight made breathing difficult, and was afraid of flying because she thought they might explode. Several psychologists have said she may have suffered from body dysmorphia, a rare condition in which sufferers feel compelled to continually alter their bodies. Mr Vigne, a businessman who met Ferrari when she was 17, has in the past been accused of exploiting her for his financial gain.",

Other parents can assure us that it's normal, that it doesn't mean you're a bad mother. But suppose the love remains tainted even after a good night's sleep? Suppose a mother feels resentment rather than pride when her daughter is successful?</p> <p>Throughout the last century, psychologists argued that mother envy, especially towards a daughter, is not only normal but inevitable. In 1945, Helene Deutsche claimed that women observe a daughter's adolescent blooming as a sign of their own decline. Pushed out of the sexual limelight, they experience an exquisite envy, which they disguise with protectiveness. When a mother says: \"Don't do that, it's not safe,\" what Deutsche hears her saying is: \"Don't you dare enjoy your youth, because I envy it.\"</p> <p>More recently, Susie Orbach and others have argued that young women's expanding career opportunities can arouse a mother's envy. The daughters then keep themselves back, terrified that, if they surpass her, they will be forced to eat of those proverbial poisoned apples.</p> <p>So when Jaid Barrymore, who allegedly tried to steal away daughter Drew's boyfriends, jostles for the limelight again with her own no-holds-barred account of family life, it is easy to sympathise with Drew's embarrassment and fear. And when Zadie Smith, author of Orange Prize-nominated White Teeth, claims her mother resents the fact that she earned so much by \"doing nothing, just writing a book\", we hear a familiar tune. Daughters run the last mile trying to please a mother, but their success doesn't give pleasure, only the sickly pain of envy.</p> <p>Are we witnessing individual relationships that have gone tragically wrong, or an inevitable flaw in the mother-daughter bond? Envy has two very different measures: what the envious person feels and what the envied one fears. The thought that a mother may be envious of her own daughter awakens infantile terrors of being abandoned by someone we need. What we fear then is distorted and exaggerated.</p> <p>But mothers, thinking they should take unalloyed pleasure in a daughter's development, are likely to deny their own envy, even to themselves. The only way we can measure it is to listen to mothers and daughters speak as honestly as they can, and to make the observation that their bond is complicated by the close identification each woman has with the other, alongside the need each has to be her own person, with her own admirers and her own satisfactions.</p> <p>When a mother gives up her own pursuit of success on behalf of a child, she may have mixed feelings as her maternal investments generate pay-offs for her daughter. She is proud, but may also fear her daughter will leave her behind. She may be gratified, but also feel taken for granted.</p> <p>Mother-envy is often cited as the cause of problems women have with competition, self-confidence, desire to win. The old fear: \"What if I arouse my mother's envy?\" becomes: \"What if I make my friend envious of me?\" While men seem happy to jostle for status and compete with friends, women often feel uneasy. It's not that girls don't feel competitive - they do. But they are less open about it and it is in this secrecy that envy breeds.</p> <p>The suffering incurred by envy is increased by guilt: \"What a shit to want to scream when your friend does so well.\" Though we learn to express envy in a joking way - \"You look great! I hate you!\" - we aren't supposed to feel unsettled by admiration. We're supposed to want our friends to be successful and beautiful. When we don't, we feel ashamed and worthless. And so, knowing the power of the envy they feel for others, girls are often frightened of the envy they might arouse in others. The self-denigration often observed in girl talk (\"Oh, this old thing\" or \"If you think I'm pretty, you should look in the mirror\") is a tactic for waylaying other girls' envy.</p> <p>Our fear of envy and our shame at feeling it make it impossible for us to see it clearly. But envy is not something that necessarily obliterates good feeling; it can be layered with pleasure in others' triumphs. Several mothers and daughters have been in competition with one another this week and all parties disclaim envy.</p> <p>Mary Hoffman and Rhiannon Lassiter both have a children's book published and, inevitably, compare their early careers. Hoffman was 25 when she wrote her first novel, 30 when she published it. Lassiter was 19 when she wrote her first book - and 19 when she won a contract for its publication.

Rosemary Harris and Jennifer Ehle were both nominees for this year's Tony Award for Best Actress. Well-wishers thought the best outcome would be for neither to win. Clive Barnes, writing in the New York Post, hoped Ehle wouldn't have to \"face beating her great mum\".</p> <p>Both Harris and Ehle denied feeling envy and Hoffman finds this entirely plausible. \"If Rhiannon and I were up for a prize, I would want to win!

It is a kind of depression, a sense of helplessness, and stems from disappointments we do not know how to address. Most of us have such disappointments, so we can feel envy's poison activated at any moment - even by a daughter. But maybe we should not credit envy with fear.

      "body": "<p>In homage to the famous old Athena poster of a knickerless tennis player, this month's GQ cover features Kylie Minogue hitching up her skirt on court and scratching her bare bottom. Taken by top fashion photographer Terry Richardson, the image is supposed to be provocative, flirty and, of course, ironic.</p> <p>It is knowing and detached, where the original was just horny soft-core fantasy. Personally, I prefer the original because it comes from a time before men learnt how to have their cheesecake and eat it, too, by replacing lust with arch, self-mocking humour. Anyone for postmodern tennis, as GQ editor Dylan Jones asks of the Kylie snaps.</p> <p>Maybe I'm just showing my age, though. Perhaps to a teenager today, the Kylie cover carries all the mysterious eroticism that Athena poster held to me as a girl-shy adolescent. The difference between the 70s and now is that sex is no longer just the stuff of fantasy. The tennis girl was exciting in her time, and remains memorable today, because she seemed to offer a glimpse into a closed-off world of adult sexuality.</p> <p>Sex is no longer so inaccessible. In fact it's unavoidable. You can see soft porn and strip shows on Channel 5 and cable TV, buy men's magazines with pouting lingerie shots of soap stars and read revelations about the sex lives of celebrities in the tabloids. None of this is quite what I imagined as a 13-year-old when I gazed longingly at the tennis girl. I made a correlation then between sex and adulthood, but what marks our present-day preoccupation with sex is its infantilism. That's certainly a very male trait. We've all learnt the lesson of laddism that leering at women on men's magazine covers is OK as long as you do so with a nod and a wink and an acknowledgement that men are \"basically sad\".</p> <p>But if that attitude makes my heart sink, so too does the crassness of Denise Van Outen's Something For The Weekend, with its willy gags and vibrator games. And for that matter, all the puerile euphemisms that run through the Bridget Jones school of women's fiction, where heroines never have sex, make love or even fuck, but are more likely to have a \"shag\" or \"bonk\", as if sex itself were devoid of carnality or sweat.</p> <p>In that context, Kylie baring her bottom feels like another playground gesture.

      "bodyText": "In homage to the famous old Athena poster of a knickerless tennis player, this month's GQ cover features Kylie Minogue hitching up her skirt on court and scratching her bare bottom. Taken by top fashion photographer Terry Richardson, the image is supposed to be provocative, flirty and, of course, ironic. It is knowing and detached, where the original was just horny soft-core fantasy. Personally, I prefer the original because it comes from a time before men learnt how to have their cheesecake and eat it, too, by replacing lust with arch, self-mocking humour. Anyone for postmodern tennis, as GQ editor Dylan Jones asks of the Kylie snaps. Maybe I'm just showing my age, though. Perhaps to a teenager today, the Kylie cover carries all the mysterious eroticism that Athena poster held to me as a girl-shy adolescent. The difference between the 70s and now is that sex is no longer just the stuff of fantasy. The tennis girl was exciting in her time, and remains memorable today, because she seemed to offer a glimpse into a closed-off world of adult sexuality. Sex is no longer so inaccessible. In fact it's unavoidable. You can see soft porn and strip shows on Channel 5 and cable TV, buy men's magazines with pouting lingerie shots of soap stars and read revelations about the sex lives of celebrities in the tabloids. None of this is quite what I imagined as a 13-year-old when I gazed longingly at the tennis girl. I made a correlation then between sex and adulthood, but what marks our present-day preoccupation with sex is its infantilism. That's certainly a very male trait. We've all learnt the lesson of laddism that leering at women on men's magazine covers is OK as long as you do so with a nod and a wink and an acknowledgement that men are \"basically sad\". But if that attitude makes my heart sink, so too does the crassness of Denise Van Outen's Something For The Weekend, with its willy gags and vibrator games. And for that matter, all the puerile euphemisms that run through the Bridget Jones school of women's fiction, where heroines never have sex, make love or even fuck, but are more likely to have a \"shag\" or \"bonk\", as if sex itself were devoid of carnality or sweat. In that context, Kylie baring her bottom feels like another playground gesture. It's harmless, cheeky fun. So why does it leave me so gloomy? Now that the sun's out, I spend as much time as any other man watching women walk down the street. Which is to say, a lot. In the summer, watching girls go by is the prime male spectator sport. We imagine ourselves connoisseurs of the female form. Each time we gaze at a passing figure, we're totting up length of legs, size of breasts, width of hips as though Eric Morley just swore us in to judge this year's Miss World contest.

      "body": "<p>With Israel finally out of Lebanon, it becomes more and more difficult to justify Syria's continuing presence there. UN resolution 425, passed in 1978, with which Ehud Barak's government is now in all but complete compliance, calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, not just Israeli. Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, referred directly to Syria's 35,000-strong military garrison when she demanded yesterday in Cairo that \"all parties follow through on their obligations\" to pull out. Despite the absence of a peace settlement and predictions of imminent Armageddon, Israel's northern border has been quieter these past two weeks than at any time in recent memory. For this, Syria deserves some credit. The Israeli prime minister warns that Damascus is planning to use Lebanon-based Palestinians to create new trouble. But there is no firm evidence of this so far. In any case, President Hafez Assad would be far better employed finding a way out of the hole he dug for himself at his March summit with the US in Geneva. A good beginning would be a Syrian military build-down in Lebanon.</p> <p>Mr Assad has precious little to show after 11 months of desultory, on-off contacts with the new Israeli leadership. Having dug in its heels on the Galilee shore, Syria is now further from regaining the Golan Heights than when Mr Barak first took office. With his Lebanon pledge redeemed, the Israeli PM's gaze has meanwhile shifted elsewhere. Next week, at Ms Albright's bidding, the Israeli-Palestinian talks will move to the US. The whole focus is on reaching an agreement by the September deadline. This, says Ms Albright, is now Bill Clinton's number one foreign policy priority. The issues of settlements, borders, and Jerusalem are as intractable as ever, and doubts grow about Yasser Arafat's (and Mr Barak's) ability to sell an inevitably unsatisfactory compromise. But much spadework has been quietly done in talks in Stockholm. A deal is still do-able.</p> <p>The cause of peace was hardly helped by yesterday's posturing by religious parties in the Knesset. Their support for a call for early elections was as fatuous as it was, for now at least, non-binding. It distracts Mr Barak but does not dish him. If need be, he should dispense with these self-serving, blinkered coalition partners and seek secular and Arab parliamentary allies. The end justifies such unorthodox means.</p>",

Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, referred directly to Syria's 35,000-strong military garrison when she demanded yesterday in Cairo that \"all parties follow through on their obligations\" to pull out. Despite the absence of a peace settlement and predictions of imminent Armageddon, Israel's northern border has been quieter these past two weeks than at any time in recent memory. For this, Syria deserves some credit. The Israeli prime minister warns that Damascus is planning to use Lebanon-based Palestinians to create new trouble. But there is no firm evidence of this so far. In any case, President Hafez Assad would be far better employed finding a way out of the hole he dug for himself at his March summit with the US in Geneva. A good beginning would be a Syrian military build-down in Lebanon. Mr Assad has precious little to show after 11 months of desultory, on-off contacts with the new Israeli leadership. Having dug in its heels on the Galilee shore, Syria is now further from regaining the Golan Heights than when Mr Barak first took office. With his Lebanon pledge redeemed, the Israeli PM's gaze has meanwhile shifted elsewhere. Next week, at Ms Albright's bidding, the Israeli-Palestinian talks will move to the US. The whole focus is on reaching an agreement by the September deadline. This, says Ms Albright, is now Bill Clinton's number one foreign policy priority. The issues of settlements, borders, and Jerusalem are as intractable as ever, and doubts grow about Yasser Arafat's (and Mr Barak's) ability to sell an inevitably unsatisfactory compromise. But much spadework has been quietly done in talks in Stockholm. A deal is still do-able. The cause of peace was hardly helped by yesterday's posturing by religious parties in the Knesset. Their support for a call for early elections was as fatuous as it was, for now at least, non-binding. It distracts Mr Barak but does not dish him. If need be, he should dispense with these self-serving, blinkered coalition partners and seek secular and Arab parliamentary allies. The end justifies such unorthodox means.",

Huang Qi is accused of subverting state power, a crime which could see him jailed for up to 10 years, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy. But authorities in the south-western city of Chengdu were unable to shut down his web site, which gives details of banned subjects such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and the crackdown against the Falun Gong sect, because - although it is registered in China - it is physically located on an internet service provider in the US. Nor could they stop surfers in China from viewing it through overseas proxies or \"mirror sites\", which replicate its contents. Mr Huang and his wife, Zeng Li, were detained last Saturday after posting articles on the sensitive Tiananmen Square massacre anniversary of June 4 1989, on his website at www.6-4tianwang.com. These included a call by the dissident Ding Zilin, who lost her son in the military crackdown, for the trial of Li Peng, China's premier at the time who is widely seen as one of the prime instigators in the use of force against the unarmed students. \"June 4 is a political scheme carefully plotted by the Chinese Communist party's conservative faction,\" said one article. Other articles documented allegations of official corruption and the death of a Falun Gong follower in jail after being beaten by police. Ms Zeng has since been released but was told yesterday that her husband would be facing charges, although these have yet to be laid. Mr Huang had previously been praised by Beijing for his internet activities. His first website, established last June, shot to fame after it helped reunite 10,000 people with their families, mostly women abducted into sex slavery, an increasingly serious problem in China. The site brought praise from the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist party. But then the website plunged into controversy by exposing the story of a fisherman, Zeng Quanfu, who had his appendix removed on the orders of a Chinese employment agency, to forestall any liability for his medical bills while at sea. The resulting scandal attracted nationwide attention and reportedly brought the website to the attention of China's top authorities, including the prime minister, Zhu Rongji.

These included a huge corruption scandal in the coastal city of Xiamen involving billions of pounds-worth of smuggled goods and the murder of a Beijing University student, Qiu Qingfeng, which provoked rare protests about the inadequate security that allegedly contributed to her death.

As such he fought, but failed, to control the proliferation of contractor-led housing systems, and his reputation was tarnished by public reaction after the collapse in 1968 of Ronan Point. A technocrat with an instinct for social justice and a streak of obstinacy, he had enthusiasms that belied his puritan convictions.</p> <p>Cleeve Barr was born with the name of Albert Babey. He was brought up by an army widow and educated at Sir William Borlase's School, Marlow. After training in the Bank of England, he left with an associateship of the Institute of Bankers, a new name and a contempt for bowlers and umbrellas. A short spell in 1934 at the Liverpool School of Architecture was followed by work for Charles Holden, mainly on the Senate House of London University.</p> <p>Imbued with socialist ideals, Barr became in 1936 secretary of the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants. The first trades union for building professionals, the AASTA opposed the Royal Institute of British Architects and believed architecture should be all about social welfare. Barr co-ordinated campaigns, notably one against jerry-built private housing. In the early part of the war, he was among the socialists who agitated in the East End in favour of better shelters.</p> <p>After Hitler invaded the USSR, Barr was co-opted into RAF intelligence and became a liaison officer to the Russian air force. He helped establish the route for the delivery of Catalina flying boats to the Russians, and was posted to Iran and later Berlin, where his knowledge of Russian was put to use during the four-power talks.</p> <p>By 1948, Barr finally qualified as an architect and went to work for Hertfordshire county council, then developing its famous programme of primary schools. He was given two to design, one of which, Templewood at Welwyn Garden City, was the Hertfordshire school chosen for the RIBA's Medal in 1950, and visited by Le Corbusier, who merely remarked: \"C'est jolie\".</p> <p>This was a happy period of his career. But his rebellions were not quite over. Dissatisfied by conditions of work, Barr and three others, among them Oliver Cox, left in a group for the housing branch of the London County Council's architect's department, then being energised by Robert Matthew. Barr and Cox wanted the LCC to \"do a Herts\" - to set up a group to work out a standard prefabricated \"language\" from which housing architects would make their own designs. They got some way, through Barr's persistence and Cox's fertility in designing. However, housing was not like schools, nor was the giant LCC like Herts. There were too many fingers in the pie, and they lacked the unconditional support of Leslie Martin, who succeeded Matthew in 1953. The principal monument of the group was the Alton East or Portsmouth Road section of the LCC's celebrated Roehampton Estate. Its critics - principally the designers of the adjacent Corbusian slabs at Alton West - liked to dismiss the informal melange of Alton East as \"Scandinavian\" or \"humanist\". But though less spectacular to look at, it was always the better housing.</p> <p>By the mid-50s, Cleeve Barr was becoming locked into issues of housing production and technique. His Picton Street, Camberwell, probably the first estate in the country laid out to suit the path of the travelling crane that built it, was none the better-looking for it. He was notorious for his technical obsessions. One such, relevant in those days when coal was still king and the miners were to be supported, was \"shunt flues\", meaning European methods of bringing flues in flats together to avoid the English absurdity of many separate chimneys.</p> <p>He left the LCC in 1957 for a short spell as the Ministry of Education's development group architect. But the appearance in the following year of Public Authority Housing, written in his spare time, showed where his real passion lay.</p> <p>In 1959 he became chief architect to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. Harold Macmillan had risen to power on the strength of a housing programme, and one in every five British families by then was in public housing. With a new push for numbers on, the position seemed promising. Barr set about forming a development group, which Oliver Cox came to run, again with the hope that exemplary, mainly low-rise projects using prefabricated techniques could be built and then taken up by local authorities. A few were built, notably a timber-framed estate at West Ham - close to Ronan Point.</p> <p>But in reality the chances for architects to control public housing were slipping away. The subsidy rules had shifted in favour of high-rise building. Worse, the big contractors had begun to take licences of continental systems for tall flats in heavy concrete, geared to speedy erection and profit alone.</p> <p>In 1964 Sir Donald Gibson, then in charge of technical development at Geoffrey Rippon's short-lived Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, set up the National Building Agency. The idea was to advise industry and local authorities on efficiency and productivity in building, and to put a rein on the rampant new private systems of housing.</p> <p>Cleeve Barr became chief architect and later managing director of the NBA. But the new quango never lived up to its expectations. The high-rise systems escaped its control, and there was much bickering between ministries, except in Scotland, where the NBA architects did some useful development work.</p> <p>The private sector was now dominant, while many architects were heartily sick of designing buildings in series. The collapse of Ronan Point in 1968 ushered in the era of vilification for the twin ideals of prefabrication and public housing. Architects now found out how little political influence they had really enjoyed. Barr defended his patch but was wounded. The NBA shifted to nurturing housing associations, in particular the UK Housing Association, in which Barr took personal interest. It also pressed metrication on a reluctant construction industry, and developed the then new techniques of project management for rescuing big building schemes in trouble on site.</p> <p>Having stepped down in 1975, Barr pent two years indulging a passion by running a film-making unit for the NBA, before retiring to Walton on Thames.</p> <p>He could be formidable in committee and was sometimes feared, despite a private simplicity and humility which enabled him to face setbacks with stoicism. He painted, sculpted and potted, and was involved with community activities.</p> <p>His first wife, Edith, with whom he had a son and a daughter, died in 1965. His second wife, Mary, survives him.</p> <p>Albert William Cleeve Barr, architect, born October 5 1910; died May 30 2000</p>",

As such he fought, but failed, to control the proliferation of contractor-led housing systems, and his reputation was tarnished by public reaction after the collapse in 1968 of Ronan Point. A technocrat with an instinct for social justice and a streak of obstinacy, he had enthusiasms that belied his puritan convictions. Cleeve Barr was born with the name of Albert Babey. He was brought up by an army widow and educated at Sir William Borlase's School, Marlow. After training in the Bank of England, he left with an associateship of the Institute of Bankers, a new name and a contempt for bowlers and umbrellas. A short spell in 1934 at the Liverpool School of Architecture was followed by work for Charles Holden, mainly on the Senate House of London University. Imbued with socialist ideals, Barr became in 1936 secretary of the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants. The first trades union for building professionals, the AASTA opposed the Royal Institute of British Architects and believed architecture should be all about social welfare. Barr co-ordinated campaigns, notably one against jerry-built private housing. In the early part of the war, he was among the socialists who agitated in the East End in favour of better shelters. After Hitler invaded the USSR, Barr was co-opted into RAF intelligence and became a liaison officer to the Russian air force. He helped establish the route for the delivery of Catalina flying boats to the Russians, and was posted to Iran and later Berlin, where his knowledge of Russian was put to use during the four-power talks. By 1948, Barr finally qualified as an architect and went to work for Hertfordshire county council, then developing its famous programme of primary schools. He was given two to design, one of which, Templewood at Welwyn Garden City, was the Hertfordshire school chosen for the RIBA's Medal in 1950, and visited by Le Corbusier, who merely remarked: \"C'est jolie\". This was a happy period of his career. But his rebellions were not quite over. Dissatisfied by conditions of work, Barr and three others, among them Oliver Cox, left in a group for the housing branch of the London County Council's architect's department, then being energised by Robert Matthew. Barr and Cox wanted the LCC to \"do a Herts\" - to set up a group to work out a standard prefabricated \"language\" from which housing architects would make their own designs. They got some way, through Barr's persistence and Cox's fertility in designing. However, housing was not like schools, nor was the giant LCC like Herts. There were too many fingers in the pie, and they lacked the unconditional support of Leslie Martin, who succeeded Matthew in 1953. The principal monument of the group was the Alton East or Portsmouth Road section of the LCC's celebrated Roehampton Estate. Its critics - principally the designers of the adjacent Corbusian slabs at Alton West - liked to dismiss the informal melange of Alton East as \"Scandinavian\" or \"humanist\". But though less spectacular to look at, it was always the better housing. By the mid-50s, Cleeve Barr was becoming locked into issues of housing production and technique. His Picton Street, Camberwell, probably the first estate in the country laid out to suit the path of the travelling crane that built it, was none the better-looking for it. He was notorious for his technical obsessions. One such, relevant in those days when coal was still king and the miners were to be supported, was \"shunt flues\", meaning European methods of bringing flues in flats together to avoid the English absurdity of many separate chimneys. He left the LCC in 1957 for a short spell as the Ministry of Education's development group architect. But the appearance in the following year of Public Authority Housing, written in his spare time, showed where his real passion lay. In 1959 he became chief architect to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. Harold Macmillan had risen to power on the strength of a housing programme, and one in every five British families by then was in public housing. With a new push for numbers on, the position seemed promising. Barr set about forming a development group, which Oliver Cox came to run, again with the hope that exemplary, mainly low-rise projects using prefabricated techniques could be built and then taken up by local authorities. A few were built, notably a timber-framed estate at West Ham - close to Ronan Point. But in reality the chances for architects to control public housing were slipping away. The subsidy rules had shifted in favour of high-rise building. Worse, the big contractors had begun to take licences of continental systems for tall flats in heavy concrete, geared to speedy erection and profit alone. In 1964 Sir Donald Gibson, then in charge of technical development at Geoffrey Rippon's short-lived Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, set up the National Building Agency. The idea was to advise industry and local authorities on efficiency and productivity in building, and to put a rein on the rampant new private systems of housing. Cleeve Barr became chief architect and later managing director of the NBA. But the new quango never lived up to its expectations. The high-rise systems escaped its control, and there was much bickering between ministries, except in Scotland, where the NBA architects did some useful development work. The private sector was now dominant, while many architects were heartily sick of designing buildings in series. The collapse of Ronan Point in 1968 ushered in the era of vilification for the twin ideals of prefabrication and public housing. Architects now found out how little political influence they had really enjoyed. Barr defended his patch but was wounded. The NBA shifted to nurturing housing associations, in particular the UK Housing Association, in which Barr took personal interest. It also pressed metrication on a reluctant construction industry, and developed the then new techniques of project management for rescuing big building schemes in trouble on site. Having stepped down in 1975, Barr pent two years indulging a passion by running a film-making unit for the NBA, before retiring to Walton on Thames. He could be formidable in committee and was sometimes feared, despite a private simplicity and humility which enabled him to face setbacks with stoicism. He painted, sculpted and potted, and was involved with community activities. His first wife, Edith, with whom he had a son and a daughter, died in 1965. His second wife, Mary, survives him. Albert William Cleeve Barr, architect, born October 5 1910; died May 30 2000",

However, he often acted as a highly resourceful bridge between both worlds, producing some of Broadway's most famous musicals, many of which were turned into films.</p> <p>Fryer came up at a time when a Broadway musical could be made out of street smarts and luck. Take the example of Wonderful Town: Fryer bought the rights to the play My Sister Eileen, and told both director George Abbott and Rosalind Russell that each had agreed to work on the show, even though they hadn't. Both signed on, believing the other was on board.</p> <p>The first score had to be scrapped - Abbott didn't like it - but Leonard Bernstein was free and in need of money, and his old On the Town collaborators, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, were also interested. There were still problems: it had to be written inside six weeks and, as the legend goes, both Green and Bernstein were to have elective surgery. They arranged to recover in the same hospital room, allowing them to work on the show in their compromised state. Thus, the world now has songs such as 100 Easy Ways to Lose a Man and Conga, neither of them Bernstein classics, but even now fun to encounter in a show that can still surprise and charm.</p> <p>This would suggest Fryer was an extremely lucky man, but luck alone can't account for a string of hits whose casts read like a near-comprehensive list of Broadway divas. He also worked with Russell in her signature role in Auntie Mame; went on to produce the musical adaptation Mame that made a Broadway star out of Angela Lansbury, and then assembled two of the greatest collaborations between Gwen Verdon and Bob Fosse - Sweet Charity and Chicago.</p> <p>If there is any fault to be found in his starry list of credits - which also includes the Michael Frayn plays Noises Off and Wild Honey, plus any number of Neil Simon stage works - it was his tendency to get too much mileage out of a given property. The world definitely didn't need the much-reviled movie version of Mame (which nearly ended the career of its star, Lucille Ball) nor the reputedly iffy TV version of Wonderful Town. Yet his best known ventures for the big screen tended to win Oscars.</p> <p>Fryer was born in Washington, DC, and educated at Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He began his show-business career as a casting director with CBS television but, in migrating to the stage, learned the intricacies of that world from the master, George Abbott. It was with Abbott that he co-produced A Tree Grows in Brooklyn in 1951, launching his career on Broadway, which climaxed with two Stephen Sondheim/Harold Prince shows: Sweeney Todd and the much-revised flop Merrily We Roll Along.</p> <p>During the 1970s and 80s, Fryer put the Ahmanson Theatre at the Los Angeles Music Centre on the national theatrical map. Here he provided a forum for those who, like him, moved in both worlds (such as Rex Harrison, Maggie Smith and Katharine Hepburn) and for convincing movie talents such as Elizabeth Taylor to try the stage.</p> <p>Thanks to Fryer, Taylor had her one stage triumph in Lilian Hellman's The Little Foxes. His hallmark was understanding the insecurities of those with big talent: \"My heart goes out to the great stars - they feel a deep sense of responsibility to the audience.\"</p> <p>He was good with writers, too: Neil Simon tried out five plays in Los Angeles with Fryer, who was prized for his taste, direction and tactful way of projecting it on to others. His plays won 37 Tony awards and 36 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle awards. Last year, he was given a lifetime achievement citation from the Ovation awards in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Robert Fryer, producer, born 1921; died May 28 2000</p>",

However, he often acted as a highly resourceful bridge between both worlds, producing some of Broadway's most famous musicals, many of which were turned into films. Fryer came up at a time when a Broadway musical could be made out of street smarts and luck. Take the example of Wonderful Town: Fryer bought the rights to the play My Sister Eileen, and told both director George Abbott and Rosalind Russell that each had agreed to work on the show, even though they hadn't. Both signed on, believing the other was on board. The first score had to be scrapped - Abbott didn't like it - but Leonard Bernstein was free and in need of money, and his old On the Town collaborators, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, were also interested. There were still problems: it had to be written inside six weeks and, as the legend goes, both Green and Bernstein were to have elective surgery. They arranged to recover in the same hospital room, allowing them to work on the show in their compromised state. Thus, the world now has songs such as 100 Easy Ways to Lose a Man and Conga, neither of them Bernstein classics, but even now fun to encounter in a show that can still surprise and charm. This would suggest Fryer was an extremely lucky man, but luck alone can't account for a string of hits whose casts read like a near-comprehensive list of Broadway divas. He also worked with Russell in her signature role in Auntie Mame; went on to produce the musical adaptation Mame that made a Broadway star out of Angela Lansbury, and then assembled two of the greatest collaborations between Gwen Verdon and Bob Fosse - Sweet Charity and Chicago. If there is any fault to be found in his starry list of credits - which also includes the Michael Frayn plays Noises Off and Wild Honey, plus any number of Neil Simon stage works - it was his tendency to get too much mileage out of a given property. The world definitely didn't need the much-reviled movie version of Mame (which nearly ended the career of its star, Lucille Ball) nor the reputedly iffy TV version of Wonderful Town. Yet his best known ventures for the big screen tended to win Oscars. Fryer was born in Washington, DC, and educated at Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He began his show-business career as a casting director with CBS television but, in migrating to the stage, learned the intricacies of that world from the master, George Abbott. It was with Abbott that he co-produced A Tree Grows in Brooklyn in 1951, launching his career on Broadway, which climaxed with two Stephen Sondheim/Harold Prince shows: Sweeney Todd and the much-revised flop Merrily We Roll Along. During the 1970s and 80s, Fryer put the Ahmanson Theatre at the Los Angeles Music Centre on the national theatrical map. Here he provided a forum for those who, like him, moved in both worlds (such as Rex Harrison, Maggie Smith and Katharine Hepburn) and for convincing movie talents such as Elizabeth Taylor to try the stage. Thanks to Fryer, Taylor had her one stage triumph in Lilian Hellman's The Little Foxes. His hallmark was understanding the insecurities of those with big talent: \"My heart goes out to the great stars - they feel a deep sense of responsibility to the audience.\" He was good with writers, too: Neil Simon tried out five plays in Los Angeles with Fryer, who was prized for his taste, direction and tactful way of projecting it on to others. His plays won 37 Tony awards and 36 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle awards. Last year, he was given a lifetime achievement citation from the Ovation awards in Los Angeles.
