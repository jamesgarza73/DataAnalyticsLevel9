      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>So far this has been a non-vintage season for Manchester United - not a bad one by any means but, by United's own recent standards, rather ordinary. </p> <p>Of course, the majority of the teams below Sir Alex Ferguson's side in the Premiership would dearly love to achieve such ordinariness, even for one game. And should Manchester United win the championship yet again, sentiments expressed by Graeme Souness when Liverpool completed a hat-trick of championships in 1984 may come to mind. </p> <p>The decisive point having been achieved through a drab goalless draw at Notts County, Souness declared that \"maybe by our own standards we don't deserve the title this time but by everybody else's standards we do\". </p> <p>Quite so. Having completed the historic treble of Premiership, FA Cup and European Cup last season with that as tonishing comeback against Bayern Munich at the Nou Camp, United were always going to be hard pressed to achieve much that was going to be considered out of the ordinary the next time around. </p> <p>Now Ferguson's players are even treating the Champions League as a matter of routine and will this morning fly to Bordeaux confident of repeating in the Lescure Stadium their easy win over the French champions last Wednesday. </p> <p>For, fitful though United's performances may occasionally be, no opponents have yet been able to sow a seed of self-doubt in the players' minds: not Chelsea, who defeated them 5-0 last October, and not Fiorentina, their conquerors in the second group phase of the Champions League. </p> <p>Yet for a couple of seconds on Saturday a player well capable of sending a chill down Old Trafford's spine looked set to bring Liverpool a victory which might well have had Manchester United looking nervously over their shoulders. </p> <p>Michael Owen, recovered from his latest hamstring problem, had just come off the bench for the last quarter-hour and wasted no time outpacing United's defenders as he gathered a through-pass from Danny Murphy and broke clear. Even with Rai mond van der Gouw quick to narrow the angle a goal appeared likely but, after seeing his shot beat the United goalkeeper, Owen then watched it bounce wide of the far post. </p> <p>The scare was enough to persuade Ferguson to shuffle his back four, with Gary Neville moved in alongside Jaap Stam, Denis Irwin switched to right-back and Mickael Silvestre moved to left-back, where he would not be in Owen's sights. </p> <p>After the match the United manager said that his was the one team trying to win but Owen should have won it for Liverpool all the same. </p> <p>With Ryan Giggs rampant and David Beckham's crosses immaculate United dominated large areas of the game in terms of possession and territory. </p> <p>But the policy of containment and counter-attack which had brought Liverpool a creditable victory at Arsenal and one stunning example of the shooting which had beaten Leeds at Anfield might have seen G\u00e9rard Houllier's team take a lead of two or three goals in the opening 36 minutes. </p> <p>This is a much tougher Liverpool team than the pretty-passing, preening side that greeted Houllier on his arrival at Anfield to share the management with Roy Evans. As Ferguson observed: \"I think G\u00e9rard has done very well. Not only did he make important decisions but he made them quickly. Now they're a very physical team. Apart from Vladimir Smicer everyone's over 6ft. This is a team that will battle hard in the English league.\" </p> <p>Saturday morning's match was more a battle of wits than a muscular conflict although arguably the game did turn on one ugly tackle which went unpunished. </p> <p>Manchester United had fallen behind shortly before the half-hour to another of Patrik Berger's thunderous free-kicks, this one awarded after Silvestre and Stam had become entangled trying to stop Erik Meijer, with Stam pulling the German back as he threatened to break clear. </p> <p>Berger then saw a goalbound header saved by Van der Gouw and a shot on target from Titi Camara struck the unwitting Stam with the keeper exposed to emphasise the grip Liverpool were beginning to take on the match. </p> <p>Then six minutes before half-time Ole Gunnar Solskjaer caught Sami Hyypia, Liverpool's most dominant centre-back, with a lunge which left the Finn needing stitches in a gashed leg. </p> <p>Hoping, vainly as it turned out, that Hyypia could continue after half-time and having already lost Vegard Heggem with a hamstring problem, Houllier withdrew Jamie Carragher to his back four and played on with 10 men. </p> <p>But in first-half stoppage time Solskjaer beat Dominic Matteo to a cross from Ryan Giggs and deftly turned the ball past Sander Westerveld. </p> <p>Later Carragher denied United victory by clearing shots from Solskjaer, Giggs and Teddy Sheringham off the goal-line. For Liverpool it was an important point of order.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So far this has been a non-vintage season for Manchester United - not a bad one by any means but, by United's own recent standards, rather ordinary. Of course, the majority of the teams below Sir Alex Ferguson's side in the Premiership would dearly love to achieve such ordinariness, even for one game. And should Manchester United win the championship yet again, sentiments expressed by Graeme Souness when Liverpool completed a hat-trick of championships in 1984 may come to mind. The decisive point having been achieved through a drab goalless draw at Notts County, Souness declared that \"maybe by our own standards we don't deserve the title this time but by everybody else's standards we do\". Quite so. Having completed the historic treble of Premiership, FA Cup and European Cup last season with that as tonishing comeback against Bayern Munich at the Nou Camp, United were always going to be hard pressed to achieve much that was going to be considered out of the ordinary the next time around. Now Ferguson's players are even treating the Champions League as a matter of routine and will this morning fly to Bordeaux confident of repeating in the Lescure Stadium their easy win over the French champions last Wednesday. For, fitful though United's performances may occasionally be, no opponents have yet been able to sow a seed of self-doubt in the players' minds: not Chelsea, who defeated them 5-0 last October, and not Fiorentina, their conquerors in the second group phase of the Champions League. Yet for a couple of seconds on Saturday a player well capable of sending a chill down Old Trafford's spine looked set to bring Liverpool a victory which might well have had Manchester United looking nervously over their shoulders. Michael Owen, recovered from his latest hamstring problem, had just come off the bench for the last quarter-hour and wasted no time outpacing United's defenders as he gathered a through-pass from Danny Murphy and broke clear. Even with Rai mond van der Gouw quick to narrow the angle a goal appeared likely but, after seeing his shot beat the United goalkeeper, Owen then watched it bounce wide of the far post. The scare was enough to persuade Ferguson to shuffle his back four, with Gary Neville moved in alongside Jaap Stam, Denis Irwin switched to right-back and Mickael Silvestre moved to left-back, where he would not be in Owen's sights. After the match the United manager said that his was the one team trying to win but Owen should have won it for Liverpool all the same. With Ryan Giggs rampant and David Beckham's crosses immaculate United dominated large areas of the game in terms of possession and territory. But the policy of containment and counter-attack which had brought Liverpool a creditable victory at Arsenal and one stunning example of the shooting which had beaten Leeds at Anfield might have seen G\u00e9rard Houllier's team take a lead of two or three goals in the opening 36 minutes. This is a much tougher Liverpool team than the pretty-passing, preening side that greeted Houllier on his arrival at Anfield to share the management with Roy Evans. As Ferguson observed: \"I think G\u00e9rard has done very well. Not only did he make important decisions but he made them quickly. Now they're a very physical team. Apart from Vladimir Smicer everyone's over 6ft. This is a team that will battle hard in the English league.\" Saturday morning's match was more a battle of wits than a muscular conflict although arguably the game did turn on one ugly tackle which went unpunished. Manchester United had fallen behind shortly before the half-hour to another of Patrik Berger's thunderous free-kicks, this one awarded after Silvestre and Stam had become entangled trying to stop Erik Meijer, with Stam pulling the German back as he threatened to break clear. Berger then saw a goalbound header saved by Van der Gouw and a shot on target from Titi Camara struck the unwitting Stam with the keeper exposed to emphasise the grip Liverpool were beginning to take on the match. Then six minutes before half-time Ole Gunnar Solskjaer caught Sami Hyypia, Liverpool's most dominant centre-back, with a lunge which left the Finn needing stitches in a gashed leg. Hoping, vainly as it turned out, that Hyypia could continue after half-time and having already lost Vegard Heggem with a hamstring problem, Houllier withdrew Jamie Carragher to his back four and played on with 10 men. But in first-half stoppage time Solskjaer beat Dominic Matteo to a cross from Ryan Giggs and deftly turned the ball past Sander Westerveld. Later Carragher denied United victory by clearing shots from Solskjaer, Giggs and Teddy Sheringham off the goal-line. For Liverpool it was an important point of order.",

There is little love lost between the the former LGC leader and colleagues at Westminster.</p> <p>''The people who know him best do not trust him,'' said Frank Dobson, the man whose near-certainty of victory on May 4 - once he became Labour's official candidate last month - is now threatened by confirmation that he will now have a rival for Labour votes in Mr Livingstone.</p> <p>Labour's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, moved quickly to suspend Mr Livingstone from his party membership of 31 years - pending the result of an investigation which was also set in train tonight or his ''automatic'' self-expulsion if he files formal nomination papers by April 4.</p> <p>And he will. After two weeks of uncertainty, as he tested the water and watched for opinion polls which might boost his chances, Mr Livingstone knew he could no longer hesitate. The die is cast.</p> <p>Party officials at Millbank and ministers purport to be relieved that the uncertainty is now over. ''He'll have to defend his policies now. He loves playing the hero against the machine, that's what made him in 1987 and again now. But it won't be easy from here on,'' predicted one cabinet minister.</p> <p>Mr Dobson's belated campaign for Labour's nomination was accident-prone and derided. But the ex-health secretary closed the gap as voting ended. The reason for hostility towards ''Chat Show Ken'' as his detractors call him is complex. Any MP who can attract more than his fair share of media attention always earns jealousy among less deft colleagues.</p> <p>Mr Livingstone is a media star, as good a spin doctor as Alastair Campbell, as funny on TV as Tony Banks. That makes him a formidable populist, capable of running an ''insurgency'' campaign with media help against the party machines - just as Senator John McCain of Arizona is doing from the populist right in the US presidential race.</p> <p>More serious charges are that (like Senator McCain) he is not a good team player, but a compulsive loner - ''the ego has landed'' was Mr Dobson's jibe tonight - who is an instinctive oppositionist, as likely to torment New Labour in government as he did the Thatcher government in the 1980s.</p> <p>''With me, it's visceral,'' said one Northern Labour MP tonight. ''I hate the guy. All he's done since I was elected in 1992 is to attack the Labour party. What's he managed to achieve since he was elected in 1987, 13 wasted years.''</p> <p>Mr Livingstone won 8 leftwing votes (plus his own) from London's 57 MPs in the electoral college. Several of those MPs look likely to back him in all but name - to do so would cost them their seats. But the Brent MP never took command of even the Campaign Group to become its post-Benn champion.</p> <p>Tony Blair says he would like to have harnessed Mr Livingstone's talents despite his own experience as an unknown party foot-soldier during the heyday of the Livingstone-led GLC. ''People simply voted Labour out of loyalty,'' Mr Blair now says. ''Cuddly Ken is just a myth,'' says one senior colleague. The gloves are coming off.</p>",

''The people who know him best do not trust him,'' said Frank Dobson, the man whose near-certainty of victory on May 4 - once he became Labour's official candidate last month - is now threatened by confirmation that he will now have a rival for Labour votes in Mr Livingstone. Labour's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, moved quickly to suspend Mr Livingstone from his party membership of 31 years - pending the result of an investigation which was also set in train tonight or his ''automatic'' self-expulsion if he files formal nomination papers by April 4. And he will. After two weeks of uncertainty, as he tested the water and watched for opinion polls which might boost his chances, Mr Livingstone knew he could no longer hesitate. The die is cast. Party officials at Millbank and ministers purport to be relieved that the uncertainty is now over. ''He'll have to defend his policies now. He loves playing the hero against the machine, that's what made him in 1987 and again now. But it won't be easy from here on,'' predicted one cabinet minister. Mr Dobson's belated campaign for Labour's nomination was accident-prone and derided. But the ex-health secretary closed the gap as voting ended. The reason for hostility towards ''Chat Show Ken'' as his detractors call him is complex. Any MP who can attract more than his fair share of media attention always earns jealousy among less deft colleagues. Mr Livingstone is a media star, as good a spin doctor as Alastair Campbell, as funny on TV as Tony Banks. That makes him a formidable populist, capable of running an ''insurgency'' campaign with media help against the party machines - just as Senator John McCain of Arizona is doing from the populist right in the US presidential race. More serious charges are that (like Senator McCain) he is not a good team player, but a compulsive loner - ''the ego has landed'' was Mr Dobson's jibe tonight - who is an instinctive oppositionist, as likely to torment New Labour in government as he did the Thatcher government in the 1980s. ''With me, it's visceral,'' said one Northern Labour MP tonight. ''I hate the guy. All he's done since I was elected in 1992 is to attack the Labour party. What's he managed to achieve since he was elected in 1987, 13 wasted years.'' Mr Livingstone won 8 leftwing votes (plus his own) from London's 57 MPs in the electoral college. Several of those MPs look likely to back him in all but name - to do so would cost them their seats. But the Brent MP never took command of even the Campaign Group to become its post-Benn champion. Tony Blair says he would like to have harnessed Mr Livingstone's talents despite his own experience as an unknown party foot-soldier during the heyday of the Livingstone-led GLC. ''People simply voted Labour out of loyalty,'' Mr Blair now says. ''Cuddly Ken is just a myth,'' says one senior colleague. The gloves are coming off.",

      "body": "<p>Today is speech day at Roedean College. The string orchestra plays Mozart as the parents gather in the centenary hall. They have come to hear the report on the state of the school, to join the applause for the retiring staff and to watch the three head girls deliver their review of the year, but most of all, these mothers and fathers have come to salute the achievements of their children. </p> <p>The headteacher, Patricia Metham, calls the girls up one by one, announcing their awards and their prizes and their exam results. \"Irina Allport, eight and a half passes at GCSE. Leonara Bowen, nine and a half passes. Angelica Chan, 11 passes.\" The applause drenches the hall. </p> <p>Mrs Metham says the school's results are the best in Sussex and place Roedean high in the first division of league tables. And the future? \"For those at Roedean,\" she declares, \"it need hold no terrors.\" </p> <p>Down the grassy hill, on the far side of the Roedean playing fields, on this October Saturday it is just another morning on the Whitehawk estate - lads belting a football around East Brighton park, dogs sniffing at the dustbins. Whitehawk is a sprawl of terraced red-brick houses, home to something like 11,000 people, most of them white, many of them out of work. Whitehawk is the poorest estate in Brighton and one of the poorest 10% in the country. </p> <p>While Patricia Metham is celebrating success, another headteacher is having a very different experience. Libby Coleman spent three long years as the headteacher of Stanley Deason comprehensive school on the Whitehawk estate and now she sits at home, less than a mile away, staring out at the sea and looking back over those years that began with so much hope when she had no idea - really, none at all - that by the time she left, her career as a head, her health and the school would all be in ruins. </p> <p>This is the story of two women. In many ways, they are quite separate - the secure and confident head of the famous old private school where almost every pupil scores at least five top grades at GCSE, and the rueful and defeated head of the state school where only 10% of the children could achieve the same marks. </p> <p>The two women have never met. The strip of land between Roedean and Whitehawk marks the most notorious division in British society. And yet, for all this separation, the women have this in common: that after several decades in teaching they know what makes schools tick. </p> <p><strong> High achievers</strong><br> A few weeks before Roedean's speech day, Tony Blair appeared on Channel 4 news and talked about this same division. He made clear how passionately he wants state schools to match the results of their private counterparts. You can see why. There are 550,000 children in private schools. They count for a mere 7% of the pupil population and yet provide more than 20% of those who make it to university and nearly 50% of those who go to Oxford and Cambridge. A Financial Times survey of A-level results last year revealed that all but 13 of the top 100 schools were in the private sector. In the private schools 80% of pupils pass five or more GCSEs at grades A-C; in the state schools only 43% reach the same standard. </p> <p>Why is this happening? In government circles, the answer has been agreed for years: teachers in state schools fail to do their job properly. The analysis is alarming: over a period of 30 years, beginning in the 60s, the quest for excellence was undermined by an obsession with equality; student teachers were injected with a theory of child-centred learning that poisoned the heart of pedagogy, allowing the pupil to dictate the pace and direction of teaching; discipline and effort were banned from classrooms where no child might now be accused of failure; whole-class instruction gave way to groups of children ambling along; criticism was replaced by consolation, and achievement was subverted by a poverty of expectation. </p> <p>By contrast, according to this view, the private schools were innoculated from this progressive disease by their tradition of competitive achievement. </p> <p>This perspective was born on the right as a rebuttal to the comprehensive movement. It was expressed with clarity by the former Tory education minister, George Walden, in his book, We Should Know Better: \"The idea that every child can advance at his or her pace by informal, non-competitive techniques that favour spontaneity over effort is a beautiful dream which, lodged in impressionable minds and given scientific status, becomes unconscious dogma. In reality, it leads to overstressed teachers, low aspirations for the gifted and ungifted alike, bored or disaffected pupils, and an enormous waste of time and money. The contrast with the private sector needs little emphasis.\" </p> <p>Rightwing journalists pursued the same critique with passion and found that, in opposition, Tony Blair's Labour party had joined their crusade. It is now close to the heart of New Labour's approach to education to see private schools not as an enemy to be abolished, but as a partner to be emulated - as \"a benchmark of best practice\". In the three months before Roedean's speech day, both the head of Ofsted, Chris Woodhead, and the minister for school standards, Estelle Morris, spoke at conferences of private headteachers, stressing admiration for their work. Since May 1997 the government has invested \u00a31.6m in bridge-building schemes to allow state-school pupils to enjoy the techniques of private-school teaching. </p> <p>It is explicit in this analysis that the strength of private schools is not to be explained by their intake of highly motivated children from affluent families, compared with the deprived and demotivated children in some state schools - in the government's words, \"poverty is no excuse\". Nor is it to be explained by the extra resources or smaller class sizes in private schools, as Mr Woodhead has explained repeatedly, pointing instead to \"a toxic mix of educational beliefs and mismanagement\". As the department for education recently told the Guardian: \"The quality of teaching is the main thing.\" </p> <p><strong> Hopeful start</strong><br> Libby Coleman was full of hope when she arrived at Whitehawk. It was January 1995. She had already been a head for 10 years, first in Northampton and then in Barnet, and she had done well -and yet she wanted something different. In both her schools, she had seen deprived children struggling to make the grade and she believed she could help them, that poverty was no reason for failure. </p> <p>She was excited by all the new ideas that were bubbling out of the political world - literacy hours, numeracy hours, mentors, beacon schools - and so she had decided to move to a school that was really struggling and to try to use these ideas to turn it around. </p> <p>Stanley Deason was struggling with poverty. Ms Coleman was struck by two things: some 45% of its pupils were poor enough to claim free school meals, and almost all of them were white. There were no aspiring immigrants here, pushing their children to succeed. These were second- and third-generation long-term unemployed. By the time the children reached Stanley Deason many of them had fallen way behind. Among the year seven children she found only 10% had a reading age of 11. And the attendance was terrible. On average, each morning, only 72% of pupils were turning up. By the afternoon, even more had faded away. </p> <p>Ms Coleman was undaunted. She could do it, she was sure. As the weeks passed, she found the kids had a wildness in them. There were children who reeked of lighter fluid: they had soaked their shirts in the stuff and hooked them over their faces to suck in the fumes. One boy had started working as a prostitute down on the Brighton waterfront: as far as Ms Coleman could find out, he had originally been seduced by his stepfather who had tried to cash in by taking the lad to Amsterdam to sell him in the brothels there. </p> <p>Then she was dealing with a lovely, bright girl who had the intelligence to reach the top level in her Sats tests but she wouldn't speak. Not a sound. Ms Coleman had come across such muteness before - it is often a sign of abuse. But she was told there was hardly any point pursuing it: there was so much sexual abuse on Whitehawk that unless you had real evidence no one was going to try to prove it. </p> <p>In Whitehawk, she learned, the apparently simple could rapidly become bizarre and frightening. She was asked to find a place for a 14-year-old boy who had been expelled from another school. As soon as she met him she could see he had good in him but, within days, the boy was abducted from the estate by three men who drove him to some woods and raped him. She had the boy and his mother in afterwards to talk about it, but the mother was incoherent with tears and the boy attacked her. There was nothing she could do. He ended up in a locked ward. </p> <p>The parents were as troubled as the children. She held an open day for new parents but a group of them turned on a young mother who had been a pupil there with them years ago and started bullying her, just as they had done as children. Some parents disappeared; one ran off to London with her pimp, leaving her boy with his blind grandmother. </p> <p>Still, this was why she had come here, to help kids in this kind of trouble. She was sure she would be all right. But if there was a problem that worried her it was in the staffroom. From the first she had been warned she was in trouble. The vice-chairman of the governors, a man called Robert Metcalfe, universally known as \"Met\", was apparently dead set against her. Having retired as the school's deputy head, he seemed to look upon the place as his personal fiefdom. He had backed another candidate for head and lost. Now he was telling anyone who would listen that this Coleman woman was no bloody good. She was warned that Met had several friends in the staffroom who were sewing the seeds of dissent. They were saying she would be out in less than six months. </p> <p><strong> Free thinkers</strong><br> Patricia Metham's study is a peaceful place. There is a group of wicker chairs in front of the fireplace, a Persian rug, a collection of sculpted hands, a computer, a printer, a teddy bear, a neat and tidy desk and a picture window looking down over the playing fields to the sea. Mrs Metham is intelligent, forceful and clear in her thinking. First of all, she is clear that Roedean is not the private school of familiar cliche, all fresh air and hockey sticks. It is a place of academic excellence but, more than that, she says, it is a place of breadth, which prizes drama and dance and sport and music. Even more than that, she wants it to be a place for free thinkers. She was rather proud to find one of her old girls leading a rent strike at Oxford last year. \"Intelligent independence\" is her mantra. </p> <p>It may be for this reason that although she knows what ministers and conservative journalists say about private schools such as hers, she does not agree with them. Not at all. </p> <p>Teaching technique comes into their success, but her explanation has almost nothing in common with the government's analysis. It is built, first of all, on a simple foundation: the intake of children. \"Those schools that dominate the league tables choose to be, and can afford to be, highly selective,\" she says. Every pupil who wants to enter Roedean sits an exam. The 11-year-olds who enter the school are among the brightest and the best. </p> <p>Roedean puts its year seven pupils through cognitive ability tests. Last year not a single child was below the national average for non-verbal or quantitative skills. And all of them could read. </p> <p>Mrs Metham goes further. It is not just that these children have their academic engines running when they reach the school, but they tend to be from homes that have impressed on them the need to take education seriously. \"On the whole, we have highly motivated pupils and highly motivated parents.\" </p> <p>This is the most important part of the story - the intake of able children from supportive families - but it is by no means the end of the explanation. Three years ago the London School of Economics produced a study that compared the educational achievements of students who went to private schools on the Tories' assisted places scheme with the achievements of those who had turned down such places. </p> <p>The LSE checked the verbal and non-verbal reasoning scores of the two groups and confirmed that the two sets of students were similarly able. And yet by the time they came to take their A-levels the group who had opted for the private schools had clearly pulled ahead. First, they had sat more exams and second, they had scored better results. </p> <p>Translated into A-level grades, the children who went through the private schools were achieving between one and a half and three grades higher than their equivalents who had stayed in the state sector. </p> <p>The intake of children is clearly important but equally clearly, as a mass of educational research has shown, schools make a difference. The successful private schools are selecting talent. But they are also developing it. </p> <p><strong> Flirting with disaster</strong><br> On the Whitehawk estate, life at Stanley Deason was sometimes like being inside a threshing machine, as one incident crashed down on the tail of another. One moment there was a neighbouring school on the phone complaining that two Whitehawk girls had been down there with razor knives, trying to cut up a girl for flirting with one of their boyfriends. The next, a boy kicked out a water pipe and flooded the library below. Someone started a fire in the toilets. And then Ofsted said it wanted to inspect the place. </p> <p>Still, Ms Coleman knew what she wanted. She was just not so sure if she could pay for it. Early on she had discovered that the school roll was carrying \"ghost children\" - at least 30 kids whose names were being ticked off on class registers, who were being funded by the local education authority, and who were essentially fictitious. Either they had been at the school but left long ago or else, so far as she could tell, they had never existed. She called her union. It was fraud, she was told, and she could go to prison. So she called the LEA and told them about it. The ghosts were exorcised from the roll and the school lost about \u00a340,000 out of its annual budget. </p> <p>At first Ms Coleman thought she could live with the loss. Miraculously, the school had managed to store up \u00a380,000 in its reserves. Except that the money was nowhere to be found. She called in two sets of auditors in search of the cash, but it was not there. </p> <p>She wanted more teachers. There was no chance of that: the whole LEA was being told to expect a cut across the board. She wanted to buy a computer program called Success Maker for the year seven children to work with on their own, stretching each child to an appropriate level. But there was no money for that. In fact, there was no money for computers and the only ones the school had were too old to take software that used Windows. </p> <p>She tried to tackle the truants, calling the parents and posting attendance figures on the noticeboard. She thought it would help to give prizes for the class with the best attendance and for three pupils who most improved their attendance so she paid for the prizes herself. </p> <p>The whole school was struggling to drag itself forward and she could see the stress pumping through her staff. There were teachers who simply lost it and sobbed or climbed up on chairs and started yelling at the children. She saw one teacher screaming at a boy: \"You're useless, you're completely worthless.\" She did not know what was more upsetting - to see a teacher reduced to such hysteria or to see a child's self-respect so battered. In any case, she went off to the toilets to be sick. </p> <p>There were several staff off ill. An English teacher had died and everyone said it was stress. Another had simply disappeared. There were several who developed serious illnesses: cancer of the kidney, cancer of the colon. One of the art teachers had a breakdown, the head of maths left in tears, the new science teacher cracked up and took six months off. </p> <p>Only the most talented teachers could thrive against these odds. There were others who limped along, with no help or support, constantly calling in sick, forcing the school to hire supply teachers. </p> <p>And then there were those who, Ms Coleman believed, should never have gone near a classroom, teachers who treated children with contempt, who were glad when they stayed away because it made life easier and who were quite happy to manhandle them. </p> <p>She wanted to get rid of these really bad ones but she couldn't. It was not just that the law created a 12-month obstacle course to dismissal, policed at every stage by unions that would jump on the tiniest procedural fault, but, worse than that, she would need the support of the governors and most of the really bad teachers were also allies of Met Metcalfe, now making no secret of his desire to oust her. </p> <p>Soon, she was fighting a cold war against this group of teachers. From time to time, she would discipline a teacher for manhandling a student and there would be a storm of whispers in the staffroom. Teachers who had no time for Met and his gang of troublemakers began to worry that Ms Coleman was creating a culture where children were encouraged to dish dirt on teachers, true or not. Some began to say it was her fault they were suffering such stress, because she was so quick to criticise. </p> <p>Several times she went to her desk to find that someone had been through her papers. She began to take sensitive work home. As she identified problems, she found her working day stretching from eight in the morning until late at night, spilling over the weekend. Every solution seemed to spawn another problem: there were teachers who were furious when she succeeded in steering the most unruly pupils back into their classrooms. Soon, the tide of tension was reaching her, too. </p> <p>She had a lurking feeling of sickness. She found she was grinding her front teeth almost all the time, she realised that her neck and shoulders were constantly tight; in fact the tension ran all the way up around her skull and into her forehead. She was smoking more and more - up to 30 a day - and she was having trouble sleeping. </p> <p>Sometimes in the evening she would drink whisky to force the tiredness upon her, but then she would wake in the small hours and wander around the house, smoking and squeezing her hands. She realised just how bad she was becoming when a girl refused to come to school because she had been gang-raped - several of the boys who attacked her were in her class. The police seemed unable to do anything, and Ms Coleman could not see a solution in the classroom. So the girl left. But what really shocked the head was the realisation that her sadness for the girl had been quickly supplanted by quite a different feeling: dismay that she would lose the couple of thousand pounds' funding that went with the student. She was getting chest pains, too. But there was no time to worry about any of that. Ofsted was on the way. </p> <p>By the time the inspectors arrived, in May 1996, she had been running the school for 15 months. Things had improved a little, but not enough. The Ofsted team did a good job. They told Ms Coleman what she already knew: not enough children were coming to school; too many were failing exams; the school was in deficit and was going to have to make cuts to stay alive. Privately, one of them told her, they had never come across such treachery in the staffroom. </p> <p>The Ofsted inspectors offered their own version of support, but it was not one she welcomed. They suggested the school should be put into \"special measures\". They said it would help: the LEA would have to give more support, she could get a better budget, the staff would have to work together to keep the school open. But Ms Coleman was worried. She knew special measures could be a poisoned chalice: the school would be branded a failure and the few remaining middle-class families would run, taking precious money with them. If she was really unlucky, the best staff would start fleeing, too. And this was all the help on offer. </p> <p>She went home, too exhausted to think. It was half term and she believed she was dying, she could not speak, she could only shuffle, and she stayed cocooned in fatigue, wondering whether she might be rescued by death. In the car on her way back after the break she felt one side of her body go dead. She looked in the rearview mirror and saw that her face was bloodless, her lips were grey. She managed to drive to the hospital where she was told there was nothing wrong, at least not physically. </p> <p><strong> Pride of place</strong><br> Patricia Metham is proud to show you her school: the chapel with the neo-classical ceiling and the Byzantine marble; through the quiet cloisters to the renaissance garden; into the language labs; the science labs; and then the network of libraries containing 20,000 books, a collection of videos and CDs, and 25 computers linked to the internet. </p> <p>Here is the Roedean theatre; the dance studio; the art studio, the design technology suite where some of the sixth-form girls have been stripping down an old Austin; the six indoor netball courts, two indoor cricket nets, one indoor hockey pitch, the gym and full-sized indoor pool. </p> <p>It is no secret why a private school may do more for its children than a state school. Money. \"If the government want state schools to offer what we offer, they are going to have to spend on each child something much closer to the fees that our parents pay,\" Mrs Metham says. Roedean is paid \u00a310,260 a year for a day girl, roughly five times the amount a school like Whitehawk is given for each pupil. </p> <p>Money shows not only in physical resources but at the heart of the school's business, where the teacher meets the child. The biggest classes may have 20 girls, usually a highly motivated group of the same standard, but for those who are not so confident or who are approaching big exams, classes are much smaller, sometimes as small as three. The pupil-staff ratio across the school is 8:1. And, although Mrs Metham and her staff may work hard, they are not collapsing under stress and illness. </p> <p>If Patricia Metham is right - that this combination of a bright intake and adequate resources is the real foundation of her school's success -there is nevertheless more to her account. There is a third factor that finally defines the division between these two educational worlds. </p> <p> <strong> On her own</strong><br> Libby Coleman knew her school was one step away from closure. She turned to the authorities for help, but the education department took five months to authorise her action plan; the LEA was being broken up, Ofsted was supposed to come back each term but disappeared for a year. She was alone. Worse, the announcement of special measures was driving families away; that meant the budget was being cut and the governors were looking for redundancies. The staffroom was a snakepit of dissent and depression. As a result of the special measures every teacher's job was now threatened. Met's allies were constantly whispering against her - the person who would decide their future - and she knew others were blaming her for failing to protect them, for raising their hopes in the first place. </p> <p>She poured out ideas: catch-up lessons for poor attenders, a welfare officer for the lower school, work experience for older children, CCTV to stop vandals, a working party on staff absence, mentors for year 10 pupils, teachers to visit other schools, new homework programmes, shorter lessons, more lessons. But she was trapped by a lack of funds and lack of support. The staff were demanding that some of the most difficult children be excluded but the rules of special measures forbade it. Ms Coleman had identified the staff who ought to go but she could not get rid of them because no good teacher was going to replace them. The students started to roam wild in the corridors; she sent patrols of teachers with pagers and walkie-talkies to hold the line against chaos. </p> <p>Eventually, in mid-1997, more than a year after Ofsted's visit, HM inspectors came by and said things were improving, and the new Brighton and Hove authority came up with some money for a senior teacher and the Success Maker software. That September the school was relaunched with a new name, Marina High, and it became the first secondary school in the country to introduce a literacy hour. Met's term on the governing body came to an end. Ms Coleman began to think things might be all right. </p> <p>But she soon began to see that there were too many holes in the boat. The students had had a riotous summer, burning out half a dozen police cars on the estate. The police said some were working for a drugs syndicate that had moved down from Glasgow. The few new teachers were drowning in classroom disorder. One walked out for good. She decided to bring in a counsellor to help with some of the wilder children. </p> <p>He arrived to find workers removing her study door (someone had smashed a fist through it) and Ms Coleman tried to explain that she had lost her sixth girl that year, pregnant; that a 17-year-old former student had just been murdered on the rubbish tip next to the school; that the brother of one student had just been accused of helping to murder the father of another; that a boy had been run down on the crossing outside the school; that she herself had just had her purse stolen by a year eight girl who had evidently given it to her older sister, and that the older sister, a prostitute, had used her credit cards, and the police had traced her to a flat where they had found her dead from a heroin overdose along with her boyfriend, and so now the year eight girl had been taken into care and it was her friends who were upset and needed counselling. The counsellor said he would have to see what he could do. </p> <p>In November HM inspectors came back, saw a rotten collection of lessons and narrowly escaped disaster when someone threw firecrackers at them in a crowded corridor. In December the LEA warned Ms Coleman that the school would close if there was not dramatic change. She spent Christmas in a fog of defeat. She had seen a psychiatrist to try to release her stress but now carried so much tension in her shoulders and neck that her jaw locked tight and she lost the ability to speak. </p> <p>Within weeks of the new term beginning she knew she was hurtling towards disaster. In a single week children made two serious allegations of assault against staff. She followed procedure and suspended both teachers while she investigated. The staffroom went berserk and, when she reported that both allegations were groundless, the news only increased the teachers' irritation. The education department and the LEA and Ofsted and HM inspectors were all demanding results and the more Ms Coleman passed on the pressure to the staff, the more they hated her. Some wrote an anonymous letter to the LEA saying the school was in chaos and the headteacher was mad; the former governor, Met Metcalfe, phoned and demanded that the LEA sack her. </p> <p>In February 1998 the education department paid a lightning visit to the school and did not like what it saw. HM inspectors were due back and, shortly before they arrived, Ms Coleman went to the LEA and told it she could not go on. It agreed to let her go with a decent package if she would stay for the visit. The inspectors came and shook their heads and took Ms Coleman aside to tell her she had done her best, and reported that the school was still failing. It was Ms Coleman's last day. She felt mad with fatigue and maybe relief, almost speechless with lockjaw. She went for one last walk through the school, leaning on the arm of a visiting deputy head. A year eight girl saw her. \"Are you pissed, miss?\" she asked. \"No, darling - just very tired.\" The next day, she resigned. She was 52 and she would never teach again. </p> <p>When she was talking to the parents at Roedean's speech day, Patricia Metham warned her audience: \"It's not easy being a teacher these days. What other profession is so beset by 'experts' who haven't ever done the job themselves and who wouldn't last five minutes in a real school? Having in the distant past been a pupil is felt by too many to be qualification enough to dictate terms to those who are trained and experienced professionals.\" </p> <p>Nobody dictates terms to the teachers in Roedean. They are not answerable to David Blunkett, the education secretary, or his department or the LEA or Ofsted. They are not bound by the national curriculum or Sats or special measures or any of the superstructure of supervision that has settled over the state schools. And that is the third factor in Roedean's success: freedom to teach as its staff think best. </p> <p>\"All teachers in the maintained sector have been constrained by the same rather rigid bureaucracy and requirements,\" Mrs Metham says. \"If you talk to people who have had a really good educational experience, nine times out of 10 they will tell you about the charismatic teacher who stimulated an interest in a subject, an idiosyncratic person who knew enough about pacing and matching, understanding what was required. At independent schools, teachers are highly accountable - to the headteacher and to the parents - but how they get their results and what they do in the classroom or in a department, the judgment is left to them.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.educationunlimited.co.uk/specialreports/educationincrisis/story/0,5500,143807,00.html\">Continued...</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Today is speech day at Roedean College. The string orchestra plays Mozart as the parents gather in the centenary hall. They have come to hear the report on the state of the school, to join the applause for the retiring staff and to watch the three head girls deliver their review of the year, but most of all, these mothers and fathers have come to salute the achievements of their children. The headteacher, Patricia Metham, calls the girls up one by one, announcing their awards and their prizes and their exam results. \"Irina Allport, eight and a half passes at GCSE. Leonara Bowen, nine and a half passes. Angelica Chan, 11 passes.\" The applause drenches the hall. Mrs Metham says the school's results are the best in Sussex and place Roedean high in the first division of league tables. And the future? \"For those at Roedean,\" she declares, \"it need hold no terrors.\" Down the grassy hill, on the far side of the Roedean playing fields, on this October Saturday it is just another morning on the Whitehawk estate - lads belting a football around East Brighton park, dogs sniffing at the dustbins. Whitehawk is a sprawl of terraced red-brick houses, home to something like 11,000 people, most of them white, many of them out of work. Whitehawk is the poorest estate in Brighton and one of the poorest 10% in the country. While Patricia Metham is celebrating success, another headteacher is having a very different experience. Libby Coleman spent three long years as the headteacher of Stanley Deason comprehensive school on the Whitehawk estate and now she sits at home, less than a mile away, staring out at the sea and looking back over those years that began with so much hope when she had no idea - really, none at all - that by the time she left, her career as a head, her health and the school would all be in ruins. This is the story of two women. In many ways, they are quite separate - the secure and confident head of the famous old private school where almost every pupil scores at least five top grades at GCSE, and the rueful and defeated head of the state school where only 10% of the children could achieve the same marks. The two women have never met. The strip of land between Roedean and Whitehawk marks the most notorious division in British society. And yet, for all this separation, the women have this in common: that after several decades in teaching they know what makes schools tick. High achievers A few weeks before Roedean's speech day, Tony Blair appeared on Channel 4 news and talked about this same division. He made clear how passionately he wants state schools to match the results of their private counterparts. You can see why. There are 550,000 children in private schools. They count for a mere 7% of the pupil population and yet provide more than 20% of those who make it to university and nearly 50% of those who go to Oxford and Cambridge. A Financial Times survey of A-level results last year revealed that all but 13 of the top 100 schools were in the private sector. In the private schools 80% of pupils pass five or more GCSEs at grades A-C; in the state schools only 43% reach the same standard. Why is this happening? In government circles, the answer has been agreed for years: teachers in state schools fail to do their job properly. The analysis is alarming: over a period of 30 years, beginning in the 60s, the quest for excellence was undermined by an obsession with equality; student teachers were injected with a theory of child-centred learning that poisoned the heart of pedagogy, allowing the pupil to dictate the pace and direction of teaching; discipline and effort were banned from classrooms where no child might now be accused of failure; whole-class instruction gave way to groups of children ambling along; criticism was replaced by consolation, and achievement was subverted by a poverty of expectation. By contrast, according to this view, the private schools were innoculated from this progressive disease by their tradition of competitive achievement. This perspective was born on the right as a rebuttal to the comprehensive movement. It was expressed with clarity by the former Tory education minister, George Walden, in his book, We Should Know Better: \"The idea that every child can advance at his or her pace by informal, non-competitive techniques that favour spontaneity over effort is a beautiful dream which, lodged in impressionable minds and given scientific status, becomes unconscious dogma. In reality, it leads to overstressed teachers, low aspirations for the gifted and ungifted alike, bored or disaffected pupils, and an enormous waste of time and money. The contrast with the private sector needs little emphasis.\" Rightwing journalists pursued the same critique with passion and found that, in opposition, Tony Blair's Labour party had joined their crusade. It is now close to the heart of New Labour's approach to education to see private schools not as an enemy to be abolished, but as a partner to be emulated - as \"a benchmark of best practice\". In the three months before Roedean's speech day, both the head of Ofsted, Chris Woodhead, and the minister for school standards, Estelle Morris, spoke at conferences of private headteachers, stressing admiration for their work. Since May 1997 the government has invested \u00a31.6m in bridge-building schemes to allow state-school pupils to enjoy the techniques of private-school teaching. It is explicit in this analysis that the strength of private schools is not to be explained by their intake of highly motivated children from affluent families, compared with the deprived and demotivated children in some state schools - in the government's words, \"poverty is no excuse\". Nor is it to be explained by the extra resources or smaller class sizes in private schools, as Mr Woodhead has explained repeatedly, pointing instead to \"a toxic mix of educational beliefs and mismanagement\". As the department for education recently told the Guardian: \"The quality of teaching is the main thing.\" Hopeful start Libby Coleman was full of hope when she arrived at Whitehawk. It was January 1995. She had already been a head for 10 years, first in Northampton and then in Barnet, and she had done well -and yet she wanted something different. In both her schools, she had seen deprived children struggling to make the grade and she believed she could help them, that poverty was no reason for failure. She was excited by all the new ideas that were bubbling out of the political world - literacy hours, numeracy hours, mentors, beacon schools - and so she had decided to move to a school that was really struggling and to try to use these ideas to turn it around. Stanley Deason was struggling with poverty. Ms Coleman was struck by two things: some 45% of its pupils were poor enough to claim free school meals, and almost all of them were white. There were no aspiring immigrants here, pushing their children to succeed. These were second- and third-generation long-term unemployed. By the time the children reached Stanley Deason many of them had fallen way behind. Among the year seven children she found only 10% had a reading age of 11. And the attendance was terrible. On average, each morning, only 72% of pupils were turning up. By the afternoon, even more had faded away. Ms Coleman was undaunted. She could do it, she was sure. As the weeks passed, she found the kids had a wildness in them. There were children who reeked of lighter fluid: they had soaked their shirts in the stuff and hooked them over their faces to suck in the fumes. One boy had started working as a prostitute down on the Brighton waterfront: as far as Ms Coleman could find out, he had originally been seduced by his stepfather who had tried to cash in by taking the lad to Amsterdam to sell him in the brothels there. Then she was dealing with a lovely, bright girl who had the intelligence to reach the top level in her Sats tests but she wouldn't speak. Not a sound. Ms Coleman had come across such muteness before - it is often a sign of abuse. But she was told there was hardly any point pursuing it: there was so much sexual abuse on Whitehawk that unless you had real evidence no one was going to try to prove it. In Whitehawk, she learned, the apparently simple could rapidly become bizarre and frightening. She was asked to find a place for a 14-year-old boy who had been expelled from another school. As soon as she met him she could see he had good in him but, within days, the boy was abducted from the estate by three men who drove him to some woods and raped him. She had the boy and his mother in afterwards to talk about it, but the mother was incoherent with tears and the boy attacked her. There was nothing she could do. He ended up in a locked ward. The parents were as troubled as the children. She held an open day for new parents but a group of them turned on a young mother who had been a pupil there with them years ago and started bullying her, just as they had done as children. Some parents disappeared; one ran off to London with her pimp, leaving her boy with his blind grandmother. Still, this was why she had come here, to help kids in this kind of trouble. She was sure she would be all right. But if there was a problem that worried her it was in the staffroom. From the first she had been warned she was in trouble. The vice-chairman of the governors, a man called Robert Metcalfe, universally known as \"Met\", was apparently dead set against her. Having retired as the school's deputy head, he seemed to look upon the place as his personal fiefdom. He had backed another candidate for head and lost. Now he was telling anyone who would listen that this Coleman woman was no bloody good. She was warned that Met had several friends in the staffroom who were sewing the seeds of dissent. They were saying she would be out in less than six months. Free thinkers Patricia Metham's study is a peaceful place. There is a group of wicker chairs in front of the fireplace, a Persian rug, a collection of sculpted hands, a computer, a printer, a teddy bear, a neat and tidy desk and a picture window looking down over the playing fields to the sea. Mrs Metham is intelligent, forceful and clear in her thinking. First of all, she is clear that Roedean is not the private school of familiar cliche, all fresh air and hockey sticks. It is a place of academic excellence but, more than that, she says, it is a place of breadth, which prizes drama and dance and sport and music. Even more than that, she wants it to be a place for free thinkers. She was rather proud to find one of her old girls leading a rent strike at Oxford last year. \"Intelligent independence\" is her mantra. It may be for this reason that although she knows what ministers and conservative journalists say about private schools such as hers, she does not agree with them. Not at all. Teaching technique comes into their success, but her explanation has almost nothing in common with the government's analysis. It is built, first of all, on a simple foundation: the intake of children. \"Those schools that dominate the league tables choose to be, and can afford to be, highly selective,\" she says. Every pupil who wants to enter Roedean sits an exam. The 11-year-olds who enter the school are among the brightest and the best. Roedean puts its year seven pupils through cognitive ability tests. Last year not a single child was below the national average for non-verbal or quantitative skills. And all of them could read. Mrs Metham goes further. It is not just that these children have their academic engines running when they reach the school, but they tend to be from homes that have impressed on them the need to take education seriously. \"On the whole, we have highly motivated pupils and highly motivated parents.\" This is the most important part of the story - the intake of able children from supportive families - but it is by no means the end of the explanation. Three years ago the London School of Economics produced a study that compared the educational achievements of students who went to private schools on the Tories' assisted places scheme with the achievements of those who had turned down such places. The LSE checked the verbal and non-verbal reasoning scores of the two groups and confirmed that the two sets of students were similarly able. And yet by the time they came to take their A-levels the group who had opted for the private schools had clearly pulled ahead. First, they had sat more exams and second, they had scored better results. Translated into A-level grades, the children who went through the private schools were achieving between one and a half and three grades higher than their equivalents who had stayed in the state sector. The intake of children is clearly important but equally clearly, as a mass of educational research has shown, schools make a difference. The successful private schools are selecting talent. But they are also developing it. Flirting with disaster On the Whitehawk estate, life at Stanley Deason was sometimes like being inside a threshing machine, as one incident crashed down on the tail of another. One moment there was a neighbouring school on the phone complaining that two Whitehawk girls had been down there with razor knives, trying to cut up a girl for flirting with one of their boyfriends. The next, a boy kicked out a water pipe and flooded the library below. Someone started a fire in the toilets. And then Ofsted said it wanted to inspect the place. Still, Ms Coleman knew what she wanted. She was just not so sure if she could pay for it. Early on she had discovered that the school roll was carrying \"ghost children\" - at least 30 kids whose names were being ticked off on class registers, who were being funded by the local education authority, and who were essentially fictitious. Either they had been at the school but left long ago or else, so far as she could tell, they had never existed. She called her union. It was fraud, she was told, and she could go to prison. So she called the LEA and told them about it. The ghosts were exorcised from the roll and the school lost about \u00a340,000 out of its annual budget. At first Ms Coleman thought she could live with the loss. Miraculously, the school had managed to store up \u00a380,000 in its reserves. Except that the money was nowhere to be found. She called in two sets of auditors in search of the cash, but it was not there. She wanted more teachers. There was no chance of that: the whole LEA was being told to expect a cut across the board. She wanted to buy a computer program called Success Maker for the year seven children to work with on their own, stretching each child to an appropriate level. But there was no money for that. In fact, there was no money for computers and the only ones the school had were too old to take software that used Windows. She tried to tackle the truants, calling the parents and posting attendance figures on the noticeboard. She thought it would help to give prizes for the class with the best attendance and for three pupils who most improved their attendance so she paid for the prizes herself. The whole school was struggling to drag itself forward and she could see the stress pumping through her staff. There were teachers who simply lost it and sobbed or climbed up on chairs and started yelling at the children. She saw one teacher screaming at a boy: \"You're useless, you're completely worthless.\" She did not know what was more upsetting - to see a teacher reduced to such hysteria or to see a child's self-respect so battered. In any case, she went off to the toilets to be sick. There were several staff off ill. An English teacher had died and everyone said it was stress. Another had simply disappeared. There were several who developed serious illnesses: cancer of the kidney, cancer of the colon. One of the art teachers had a breakdown, the head of maths left in tears, the new science teacher cracked up and took six months off. Only the most talented teachers could thrive against these odds. There were others who limped along, with no help or support, constantly calling in sick, forcing the school to hire supply teachers. And then there were those who, Ms Coleman believed, should never have gone near a classroom, teachers who treated children with contempt, who were glad when they stayed away because it made life easier and who were quite happy to manhandle them. She wanted to get rid of these really bad ones but she couldn't. It was not just that the law created a 12-month obstacle course to dismissal, policed at every stage by unions that would jump on the tiniest procedural fault, but, worse than that, she would need the support of the governors and most of the really bad teachers were also allies of Met Metcalfe, now making no secret of his desire to oust her. Soon, she was fighting a cold war against this group of teachers. From time to time, she would discipline a teacher for manhandling a student and there would be a storm of whispers in the staffroom. Teachers who had no time for Met and his gang of troublemakers began to worry that Ms Coleman was creating a culture where children were encouraged to dish dirt on teachers, true or not. Some began to say it was her fault they were suffering such stress, because she was so quick to criticise. Several times she went to her desk to find that someone had been through her papers. She began to take sensitive work home. As she identified problems, she found her working day stretching from eight in the morning until late at night, spilling over the weekend. Every solution seemed to spawn another problem: there were teachers who were furious when she succeeded in steering the most unruly pupils back into their classrooms. Soon, the tide of tension was reaching her, too. She had a lurking feeling of sickness. She found she was grinding her front teeth almost all the time, she realised that her neck and shoulders were constantly tight; in fact the tension ran all the way up around her skull and into her forehead. She was smoking more and more - up to 30 a day - and she was having trouble sleeping. Sometimes in the evening she would drink whisky to force the tiredness upon her, but then she would wake in the small hours and wander around the house, smoking and squeezing her hands. She realised just how bad she was becoming when a girl refused to come to school because she had been gang-raped - several of the boys who attacked her were in her class. The police seemed unable to do anything, and Ms Coleman could not see a solution in the classroom. So the girl left. But what really shocked the head was the realisation that her sadness for the girl had been quickly supplanted by quite a different feeling: dismay that she would lose the couple of thousand pounds' funding that went with the student. She was getting chest pains, too. But there was no time to worry about any of that. Ofsted was on the way. By the time the inspectors arrived, in May 1996, she had been running the school for 15 months. Things had improved a little, but not enough. The Ofsted team did a good job. They told Ms Coleman what she already knew: not enough children were coming to school; too many were failing exams; the school was in deficit and was going to have to make cuts to stay alive. Privately, one of them told her, they had never come across such treachery in the staffroom. The Ofsted inspectors offered their own version of support, but it was not one she welcomed. They suggested the school should be put into \"special measures\". They said it would help: the LEA would have to give more support, she could get a better budget, the staff would have to work together to keep the school open. But Ms Coleman was worried. She knew special measures could be a poisoned chalice: the school would be branded a failure and the few remaining middle-class families would run, taking precious money with them. If she was really unlucky, the best staff would start fleeing, too. And this was all the help on offer. She went home, too exhausted to think. It was half term and she believed she was dying, she could not speak, she could only shuffle, and she stayed cocooned in fatigue, wondering whether she might be rescued by death. In the car on her way back after the break she felt one side of her body go dead. She looked in the rearview mirror and saw that her face was bloodless, her lips were grey. She managed to drive to the hospital where she was told there was nothing wrong, at least not physically. Pride of place Patricia Metham is proud to show you her school: the chapel with the neo-classical ceiling and the Byzantine marble; through the quiet cloisters to the renaissance garden; into the language labs; the science labs; and then the network of libraries containing 20,000 books, a collection of videos and CDs, and 25 computers linked to the internet. Here is the Roedean theatre; the dance studio; the art studio, the design technology suite where some of the sixth-form girls have been stripping down an old Austin; the six indoor netball courts, two indoor cricket nets, one indoor hockey pitch, the gym and full-sized indoor pool. It is no secret why a private school may do more for its children than a state school. Money. \"If the government want state schools to offer what we offer, they are going to have to spend on each child something much closer to the fees that our parents pay,\" Mrs Metham says. Roedean is paid \u00a310,260 a year for a day girl, roughly five times the amount a school like Whitehawk is given for each pupil. Money shows not only in physical resources but at the heart of the school's business, where the teacher meets the child. The biggest classes may have 20 girls, usually a highly motivated group of the same standard, but for those who are not so confident or who are approaching big exams, classes are much smaller, sometimes as small as three. The pupil-staff ratio across the school is 8:1. And, although Mrs Metham and her staff may work hard, they are not collapsing under stress and illness. If Patricia Metham is right - that this combination of a bright intake and adequate resources is the real foundation of her school's success -there is nevertheless more to her account. There is a third factor that finally defines the division between these two educational worlds. On her own Libby Coleman knew her school was one step away from closure. She turned to the authorities for help, but the education department took five months to authorise her action plan; the LEA was being broken up, Ofsted was supposed to come back each term but disappeared for a year. She was alone. Worse, the announcement of special measures was driving families away; that meant the budget was being cut and the governors were looking for redundancies. The staffroom was a snakepit of dissent and depression. As a result of the special measures every teacher's job was now threatened. Met's allies were constantly whispering against her - the person who would decide their future - and she knew others were blaming her for failing to protect them, for raising their hopes in the first place. She poured out ideas: catch-up lessons for poor attenders, a welfare officer for the lower school, work experience for older children, CCTV to stop vandals, a working party on staff absence, mentors for year 10 pupils, teachers to visit other schools, new homework programmes, shorter lessons, more lessons. But she was trapped by a lack of funds and lack of support. The staff were demanding that some of the most difficult children be excluded but the rules of special measures forbade it. Ms Coleman had identified the staff who ought to go but she could not get rid of them because no good teacher was going to replace them. The students started to roam wild in the corridors; she sent patrols of teachers with pagers and walkie-talkies to hold the line against chaos. Eventually, in mid-1997, more than a year after Ofsted's visit, HM inspectors came by and said things were improving, and the new Brighton and Hove authority came up with some money for a senior teacher and the Success Maker software. That September the school was relaunched with a new name, Marina High, and it became the first secondary school in the country to introduce a literacy hour. Met's term on the governing body came to an end. Ms Coleman began to think things might be all right. But she soon began to see that there were too many holes in the boat. The students had had a riotous summer, burning out half a dozen police cars on the estate. The police said some were working for a drugs syndicate that had moved down from Glasgow. The few new teachers were drowning in classroom disorder. One walked out for good. She decided to bring in a counsellor to help with some of the wilder children. He arrived to find workers removing her study door (someone had smashed a fist through it) and Ms Coleman tried to explain that she had lost her sixth girl that year, pregnant; that a 17-year-old former student had just been murdered on the rubbish tip next to the school; that the brother of one student had just been accused of helping to murder the father of another; that a boy had been run down on the crossing outside the school; that she herself had just had her purse stolen by a year eight girl who had evidently given it to her older sister, and that the older sister, a prostitute, had used her credit cards, and the police had traced her to a flat where they had found her dead from a heroin overdose along with her boyfriend, and so now the year eight girl had been taken into care and it was her friends who were upset and needed counselling. The counsellor said he would have to see what he could do. In November HM inspectors came back, saw a rotten collection of lessons and narrowly escaped disaster when someone threw firecrackers at them in a crowded corridor. In December the LEA warned Ms Coleman that the school would close if there was not dramatic change. She spent Christmas in a fog of defeat. She had seen a psychiatrist to try to release her stress but now carried so much tension in her shoulders and neck that her jaw locked tight and she lost the ability to speak. Within weeks of the new term beginning she knew she was hurtling towards disaster. In a single week children made two serious allegations of assault against staff. She followed procedure and suspended both teachers while she investigated. The staffroom went berserk and, when she reported that both allegations were groundless, the news only increased the teachers' irritation. The education department and the LEA and Ofsted and HM inspectors were all demanding results and the more Ms Coleman passed on the pressure to the staff, the more they hated her. Some wrote an anonymous letter to the LEA saying the school was in chaos and the headteacher was mad; the former governor, Met Metcalfe, phoned and demanded that the LEA sack her. In February 1998 the education department paid a lightning visit to the school and did not like what it saw. HM inspectors were due back and, shortly before they arrived, Ms Coleman went to the LEA and told it she could not go on. It agreed to let her go with a decent package if she would stay for the visit. The inspectors came and shook their heads and took Ms Coleman aside to tell her she had done her best, and reported that the school was still failing. It was Ms Coleman's last day. She felt mad with fatigue and maybe relief, almost speechless with lockjaw. She went for one last walk through the school, leaning on the arm of a visiting deputy head. A year eight girl saw her. \"Are you pissed, miss?\" she asked. \"No, darling - just very tired.\" The next day, she resigned. She was 52 and she would never teach again. When she was talking to the parents at Roedean's speech day, Patricia Metham warned her audience: \"It's not easy being a teacher these days. What other profession is so beset by 'experts' who haven't ever done the job themselves and who wouldn't last five minutes in a real school? Having in the distant past been a pupil is felt by too many to be qualification enough to dictate terms to those who are trained and experienced professionals.\" Nobody dictates terms to the teachers in Roedean. They are not answerable to David Blunkett, the education secretary, or his department or the LEA or Ofsted. They are not bound by the national curriculum or Sats or special measures or any of the superstructure of supervision that has settled over the state schools. And that is the third factor in Roedean's success: freedom to teach as its staff think best. \"All teachers in the maintained sector have been constrained by the same rather rigid bureaucracy and requirements,\" Mrs Metham says. \"If you talk to people who have had a really good educational experience, nine times out of 10 they will tell you about the charismatic teacher who stimulated an interest in a subject, an idiosyncratic person who knew enough about pacing and matching, understanding what was required. At independent schools, teachers are highly accountable - to the headteacher and to the parents - but how they get their results and what they do in the classroom or in a department, the judgment is left to them.\" Continued...",

Some \u00a370,000 raised from individual donations has already been spent and Mr Livingstone appealed to ordinary Londoners to \"send me cash\". The MP for Brent East said he would be following in Liberal Democrat candidate Susan Kramer's footsteps in walking down all the high streets of London to meet voters, and said that he was aiming to hold a rally in every town hall in the capital before polling day. But he also said he hoped to gain the backing of the City, claiming he had spent the last two years visiting businesses of all sizes across London to discuss their requirements from a mayor and had won a broad level of support from them, as reflected in a recent chamber of commerce poll putting him a close second to Steven Norris as the choice of the business community. A rare voice of support for Mr Livingstone from within the Labour party also came from Newport West MP Paul Flynn, who this afternoon urged Mr Dobson to step down. \"I believe that there hasn't been an enormous amount of enthusiasm shown by Frank for this post and he knows that he is likely to face the nightmare of losing as the official Labour candidate and that is going to be humiliation for him,\" Mr Flynn told BBC radio \"I believe there is another alternative which is a much more attractive one, that he says 'In the interests of fairness, I lost that election, I don't have the support of the Labour party, Ken is the moral victor, for God's sake let Ken go ahead'.\" Bookmakers William Hill installed Mr Livingstone as 1-3 favourite to win the race, following his announcement. Frank Dobson is 2-1 second favourite, with Steve Norris at 10-1 and Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer at 100-1.",

Sorry, we'll start this again.</p> <p>Big transfer news has just broken at White Hart Lane - Wimbledon striker John Hartson's widely-expected \u00a37m move to Spurs has collapsed. News of the impending signing was in all the papers all weekend, but despite all that it still looked a racing certainty. However, the small matter of a \"thorough medical\" stood in the way, and the club have \"reluctantly decided not to proceed at this moment with the transfer of the player to Tottenham Hotspur, having agreed terms with both Wimbledon on Saturday evening and John Hartson yesterday.\" </p> <p>Hartson's agent Jonathan Barnett revealed: \"It was just a routine medical and Tottenham were not happy with it. It's related to the cartilage operation he had over Christmas. John is very upset but I think he will prove them wrong. He'll score a lot more goals for Wimbledon,\" he rashly predicted, \"and maybe then another club. This is not the end for John.\"</p> <p>Barnett didn't get bitchy about it, oh no, but he did continue thus: \"It's Tottenham's loss and it's not the first player they'll have made a mistake about. With all the problems they have had [with injured players] I think they've gone overboard. They've gone potty.</p> <p>\"As far as we're concerned that's it, there's no chance of resurrecting it.\" Still, there's no stopping that Edinburgh transfer. Sorry, Portsmouth fans.</p> <p><strong>ORMONDROYD IS THERE TO BE READ</strong></p> <p>Stick men, simple drawings and jokes about football. What more could you want? Read Ormondroyd every Monday at http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk.</p> <p><strong>HE IS EMMANUEL PETIT AND HE IS ANGRY</strong></p> <p>\"Un cafe et deux croissants, s'il vous plait!\" \"Pour aller a la gare?\" \"J'aime Orangina!\" Those are acceptable things to say to a Frenchman. But \"French this\" and \"French that\" are not. Just ask He Is Emmanuel Petit, who has accused Aston Villa fans of racially abusing him during Arsenal's game at Villa Park yesterday.</p> <p>That's the reason Petit gave for his latest indiscretion - the displaying of one of his fingers, erect and proud, for all Villa fans to see.

Big transfer news has just broken at White Hart Lane - Wimbledon striker John Hartson's widely-expected \u00a37m move to Spurs has collapsed. News of the impending signing was in all the papers all weekend, but despite all that it still looked a racing certainty. However, the small matter of a \"thorough medical\" stood in the way, and the club have \"reluctantly decided not to proceed at this moment with the transfer of the player to Tottenham Hotspur, having agreed terms with both Wimbledon on Saturday evening and John Hartson yesterday.\" Hartson's agent Jonathan Barnett revealed: \"It was just a routine medical and Tottenham were not happy with it. It's related to the cartilage operation he had over Christmas. John is very upset but I think he will prove them wrong. He'll score a lot more goals for Wimbledon,\" he rashly predicted, \"and maybe then another club. This is not the end for John.\" Barnett didn't get bitchy about it, oh no, but he did continue thus: \"It's Tottenham's loss and it's not the first player they'll have made a mistake about. With all the problems they have had [with injured players] I think they've gone overboard. They've gone potty. \"As far as we're concerned that's it, there's no chance of resurrecting it.\" Still, there's no stopping that Edinburgh transfer. Sorry, Portsmouth fans. ORMONDROYD IS THERE TO BE READ Stick men, simple drawings and jokes about football. What more could you want? Read Ormondroyd every Monday at http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk. HE IS EMMANUEL PETIT AND HE IS ANGRY \"Un cafe et deux croissants, s'il vous plait!\" \"Pour aller a la gare?\" \"J'aime Orangina!\" Those are acceptable things to say to a Frenchman. But \"French this\" and \"French that\" are not. Just ask He Is Emmanuel Petit, who has accused Aston Villa fans of racially abusing him during Arsenal's game at Villa Park yesterday. That's the reason Petit gave for his latest indiscretion - the displaying of one of his fingers, erect and proud, for all Villa fans to see. This digit-based gesture was the piece de resistance of a petulant day's work which involved the usual persistent fouling, sarcastic applause and card-based discipline, and has landed the French World Cup winner (has he told you about that?) with a misconduct charge. Petit is unrepentant. \"There were many racist comments shouted at me - comments like 'French this' and 'French that'. It was racism directly straight at me, and to be honest I'm fed up with that.\" Which, to be fair, is an understandable reaction.

The French World Cup winning captain is reported to have had a heated exchange with Chelsea's manager after being dropped for the match at Newcastle. Everton's striker Francis Jeffers may miss the rest of the season with an ankle ligament injury sustained while playing for England under-21 in the 1-0 win over Argentina a fortnight ago.

      "body": "<p>As all integrated transport fans know, we're spending far too much time in our cars. Well-informed biologists will also point out that wherever humans hang around, a parasitic convoy of small creatures happily follow. Whether it's the moist delights of the air conditioning or the sumptuous comforts of the upholstery, your car is becoming a des res for all manner of creepy crawlies. </p> <p>Some are so small that you have no chance of spotting them. Take the itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei, measuring just a quarter of a millimetre.

Well-informed biologists will also point out that wherever humans hang around, a parasitic convoy of small creatures happily follow. Whether it's the moist delights of the air conditioning or the sumptuous comforts of the upholstery, your car is becoming a des res for all manner of creepy crawlies. Some are so small that you have no chance of spotting them. Take the itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei, measuring just a quarter of a millimetre.

      "body": "<p>Last Autumn Ford's chairman and managing director Ian McAllister took out full page advertisements in national newspapers promising car buyers that they could buy a new Ford with confidence, because despite all the \"rip-off Britain\" talk Ford's new car prices weren't about to be slashed. And to back this up he promised anyone who did buy a new Ford a refund if the company did subsequently cut prices; although that guarantee only lasted until the end of last year. </p> <p>If you took Mr McAllister at his word and bought a new Ford Focus last autumn you might be advised to look away now, because last Friday Ford dropped - or \"realigned\" in Fordspeak - the prices of their Focus range by up to \u00a31,000. So the 1.4 litre CL 5-door Focus, previously \u00a313,000, has just come down to \u00a312,000 - a cut of just over 7.5%. </p> <p>The Consumers' Association has enraged much of the British car industry with their ceaseless attacks on what they see as rip-off car prices, and Phil Evans, their senior policy adviser, is in no doubt as to the significance of Ford's announcement: \"Every pound taken off the price of a Focus is an admission of guilt. This announcement is proof that they have been taking British consumers for a ride and makes a mockery of their so-called 'price promise'.\" </p> <p>Another explanation for Ford's decision is that competition has simply got stiffer, not least because private buyers have been giving car dealerships a wide berth for months, and Ford has simply been forced to respond to market movements. During the few months in which Ford has been trying to hold the line on prices many other car makers have cut theirs very substantially. Recently Mitsubishi cut their prices by an average of 10%, and other car makers have been doing much the same, albeit more subtly. </p> <p>Saab and others have been enhancing the specification of their models substantially without increasing prices, while Nissan used the launch of their new Almera, which went on sale last week, to radically alter their pricing structure. The new Almera is an altogether superior car to the model it replaces, yet the new 1.5 litre E model is priced at \u00a310,700 - some \u00a3800 less than the outgoing equivalent. And what's even more significant is that even at Ford's new prices the \u00a312,000 Focus 1.4 litre Zetec 3-door is still \u00a31,300 more than the equivalent Almera. </p> <p>Ford doesn't only have its direct competition to worry about either, because the internet is causing problems too. Online buyers can now cut out British franchised dealers and simply import their new cars from Europe. The Consumers' Association will launch their own carbusters.com import service at the end of this month, and they expect to undercut even Ford's new prices. For instance the Focus 1.6 LX 5-door is now listed at \u00a313,500, down \u00a3500, but that saving seems insignificant when carbusters.com claims that it expects to be able to sell you the same car for just \u00a310,323. </p> <p>Meanwhile Vauxhall has stolen a march on Ford when it comes to selling in cyberspace, because their \".com\" range of cars is only available over the net and is attractively priced. For example the Astra.com costs \u00a311,500 - excellent value against the nearest equivalent Focus at \u00a313,500. To make matters worse for Ford the online brokers offer good deals on the Focus too: newcarsdirect.co.uk was offering the Focus 1.4 CL for just \u00a311,851.55 when I checked, and that was based on the old list price of \u00a313,000. However the list price is now down to \u00a312,000, but newcarsdirect.com's MD Richard Sanders says that Ford's realignment will simply allow him to cut the car's online price further - maybe right down to \u00a310,850. </p> <p>So does all this price cutting and on-line competition suggest that prices still have further to fall? Once again Phil Evans of the Consumers' association is in no doubt. \"Prices must be cut further across the board. Our message to consumers is to hold off from buying a new car in the UK as your pressure on the car manufacturers is beginning to bite.\" </p> <p>However some trade observers such as CAP, which publishes the trade car price bible, the Black Book, suggests that this analysis is simplistic. What really matters is the actual selling price of a new car - called the transaction price - rather than the list price. CAP's senior editor Daren Wiseman says that \"the list price tends to be a starting point for negotiations, and by waiting for it to come down consumers are missing out on some tremendous deals\". And CAP's chief economist Mark Cowling adds that he thinks that at the new prices the highly-rated and in-demand Focus represents \"a very good buy indeed\". </p> <p>So Mark Cowling's view is that the new Focus's prices won't fall further in the short term, but this doesn't mean that he thinks everything in the market is good value now, nor that overall prices haven't got further to fall. \"Overall we expect prices to stay flat or to fall slightly, and I'd expect to see some good tactical deals this summer on cars that are in the middle of their life cycle, or are that bit older.\" As an example Cowling points to the deals available on the Citro\u00ebn Saxo at present, and he adds that while the VW Golf's price is unlikely to fall there may be special deals on the older, less fashionable Passat. </p> <p>The complicating factor in all this is that trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers has now received the competition commission's report into car pricing, and although the department of trade and industry can't say when the report will be published it seems likely that it will see the light of day within the next two months. Some rumours suggest that Byers will come down hard on the car industry, which would almost certainly mean further price cuts, but even if he doesn't it's hard to see car prices going up again in the short term. </p> <p>So unless you need a new car badly I'd be inclined to hang on a little longer, although it's worth doing some shopping online, using car brokers like newcarsdirect and vehicle locators like Autohit.com. And don't forget the real world dealers, because they're hurting badly and the car makers are trying to support them with juicy marketing incentives - which all helps to bring that all-important transaction price down. Because of this, Mark Cowling of CAP argues that this is a good time to go out and see dealers and listen to what they can offer - just don't buy until you see the tears in their eyes.</p>",

      "body": "<b>What is AltaVista?</b> <p>AltaVista is a search engine which allows users to find information on any topic listed on web pages. It claims to have 45 million users across the world. Like other search engines, such as Yahoo!, AltaVista is branching out by turning itself into a portal, or a web destination in its own right. One of the few remaining independent search engines in the US, AltaVista is owned by internet incubator CMGI, which bought it from Compaq Computers. There has been widespread speculation that AltaVista may go public this year. Last year, AltaVista was estimated to be worth $5bn. </p> <p><b>What is AltaVista's free access plan for the UK?</b></p> <p>AltaVista is offering free and unlimited access to the web in the UK for an initial fee of between \u00a330 and \u00a350, with an annual renewal of \u00a310 or \u00a320. Once the initial fee is paid, AltaVista will give users a connection to a freephone 0800 number for internet use. </p> <p><b>Is AltaVista the first to offer free access?</b></p> <p>A few companies already offer completely free access. Screaming.net allows users to log on for free at weekends and off-peak times, but anyone wanting to use this service must sign up with the telephone company, Locatel, to access it. AltaVista's is the most wide-ranging scheme yet and could dramatically boost internet usage in the UK.</p> <p><b>Will this lead to savings for British consumers?</b></p> <p>Yes. Until now free access to the web in the UK has been a bit of a misnomer. Although companies like Freeserve, Britain's leading internet service provider (ISP), does not charge for access, users still have to pay for the phone charges. In the UK, unlike most of the US, internet access is charged at local phone call rates - estimated to cost each user about \u00a3126 a year, on average. The new deal could save Britain's internet users up to \u00a3700m a year in phone charges. The British government has welcomed AltaVista's plan, saying it should boost e-commerce.</p> <p><b>How does Freeserve differ from AltaVista?</b></p> <p>Freeserve customers pay no upfront fees but face phone charges of up to four pence a minute for daytime access. While Freeserve encouraged millions of people on to the web, the shock of big phone bills has deterred users from surfing for long. A Freeserve user spends about six hours a month on line compared with the 30 or so hours spent by net surfers in the US. AltaVista will not charge for phone calls.</p> <p><b>How do companies like Freeserve make money from free access?</b></p> <p>Freeserve and other internet service providers charge customers the cost of a local telephone call, and recover their own costs by taking a proportion of that telephone revenue (which British Telecommunications is required to share with the ISP's telecoms company of choice). AltaVista has not named its telecoms provider, but said it was not BT.</p> <p><b>Won't AltaVista be swamped by new customers?</b></p> <p>To cope with demand, AltaVista is to limit access to the scheme to 500,000 users in the first six months. Cable TV company Telewest suffered a series of service failures because of heavy demand when it launched its unmetered package last month. A stream of smaller ventures have suffered similar problems, hence AltaVista's graduated approach.</p> <p><b>How are AltaVista's competitors going to respond?</b></p> <p>Freeserve says it is working on its own cheap packages. BT has promised to launch unmetered access in the spring, but its plans have been delayed by a dispute with Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, and other ISPs. Other companies can be expected to match AltaVista, so it may not have the luxury of six months to limit access.</p> <p><b>How is AltaVista going to make money from the scheme?</b></p> <p>Its rivals say AltaVista stands to make big losses when it launches in three months' time. The company says it will make money from sponsorship and advertising and if it can show a huge customer base, it should be able to attract these sources of revenue.</p> <p><b>Does AltaVista have the same scheme in the US?</b></p> <p>The company has a similar service in North America, called Free Access, which has two million users and is adding about 10,000 a day.

This was the logical thing to do if you wish to find a way of preventing the purity of your message from being filtered into subversive hostility by Denis Thatcher's \"reptiles.\" What's more, the idea is not new.

Backed by its biggest annual spend ever (a notable 25% increase on last year) the offensive marks the fashion icon's unashamedly desperate bid to claw back lost territory in the casualwear market and salvage its ailing fortunes. </p> <p>It has much to do: last year, Levi's reported a 14% slump in sales, marking its third year of decline and the steepest since 1985. Numerous factories have been shutting and nearly 13,000 staff worldwide have lost their jobs over the past few years. </p> <p>Basically, no one is wearing jeans any more. Combats, cargo pants and khakis have taken over the flagging 501 in the youth leisurewear market, with Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Gap making damaging inroads. </p> <p>But what has really torpedoed the appeal of Levi's for any self-respecting follower of fashion has been the sight of motoring pundit Jeremy Clarkson and, worse, Tony Blair sporting their very own denims. I mean, really, what clubbing teenager wants to dress like the prime minister? And when a youth icon has stopped, well, appealing to \"youth\", then something drastic has to happen. </p> <p>Kenny Wilson, European marketing director of Levi's, comments: \"We're in a very similar situation to the one we were in 15 years ago, when jeans as a category was in decline and there was a general lack of interest in denim. This is an important campaign. There's a lot riding on it, but we believe that we've got a strong product and an excellent campaign.\" </p> <p>The new advertisements by Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the jean-maker's agency of 18 years' standing, embrace three 30-second TV commercials, back-cover ads in the style press and six-sheet posters around major UK cities. </p> <p>Just like the hip, heavily soundtracked work that has been flogging the 501s for the past 15 years, it uses strong tracks (by Archive and Death in Vegas, as it happens) and makes the product the hero - only this time the product is not the 501, but a bold reinvention of the traditional five-pocket western denims, trademarked Levi's Engineered Jeans (or LEJs) and loftily dubbed \"the next blueprint in denim design\". </p> <p>These new-fangled jeans were launched in stores across the nation a few weeks ago. They might look like any pair of baggy denims spotted on backsides in Notting Hill, but they are \u00a350-worth of ergonomical design that closely follows the curves of the human frame. They have bigger front pockets (almost big enough to hold a moby, in fact), a curved bottom hem to make them lie more snugly across your trainers and a new peculiarly twisted side-seam, aimed at providing greater comfort and generally easier movement. </p> <p>The campaign, specifically targeting 15-25-year-olds, picks up on this last feature with the endline \"The twisted original\". Each of the three commercials depicts an interesting twist on a traditional love scenario, showing - in one - a young couple getting increasingly sweaty together as they put more and more clothes on. The parents return, naked, and are shocked by the sight of the fully dressed youngsters. In the second there is a twist on the tale of Romeo and Juliet, as two star-crossed blow-up dolls dressed in the jeans come to a sticky end on a barbed wire fence. The third depicts two pairs of LEJs being separated on a production line, only to be reunited when they pass one day on the street, much to the embarrassment of their teenage owners. </p> <p>Nigel Bogle, chairman of BBH, explains: \"Levi's advertising has always come out of the form and function of the jeans. It is essentially product demonstration advertising, and we have executed this new work in a way that is very fresh and young. It has a speed and pace that is absolutely right for now - we are giving the brand back to young people.\" </p> <p>The blitz will be concentrated over a four-week period to guarantee that the ads are seen by \"young kids\" everywhere. Not since 1997, in fact, has there been a campaign to promote Levi's jeans: last year, lest we forget, there was Flat Eric, but wildly successful though he was, his advertising was just a fun sideshow for the sub-brand Sta-Prest rather than a serious bid to promote the ailing main jeanswear. </p> <p>Bogle says: \"Flat Eric was a bridge campaign. He drew the curtain down on one era of Levi's advertising heritage and set up what we are doing now.\" The company's dilemma, of course, is that of any number of big brands today, from Marks &amp; Spencer to Nike to British Airways, all of which are battling against the tide of a fast-changing, highly competitive world in which global domination is cruelly short-lived. </p> <p>Winston Fletcher, communications director of FCB Europe, comments: \"Resurrecting brands is not impossible to achieve but it fails more often than it succeeds. It will be tough going for Levi's. It is the name as well as the product that is the brand here, and, in the fashion arena, image is even more important than for more workaday products. To renovate a fashion brand is doubly difficult.\" </p> <p>No doubt with rebirth in mind, the jeans giant brought in Philip Marineau from PepsiCo last September to be global chief executive officer - the man who is credited with reviving the Pepsi brand with the launch of Pepsi One, so one who must know something about this thorny predicament. </p> <p>But certainly the company stands as good a chance as any of recovery: the new campaign is strong and, most importantly, there are the new LEJs themselves. These are funky, different and new, and the best thing is, Tony Blair would not be seen dead in them. Or let's hope not. Otherwise Levi's will have flung an estimated $35m in product innovation and a multi-million pound advertising budget down the proverbial.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> MONDAY</strong><br> In the lobby, Alastair Campbell gives his verdict on press reports of Tony Blair's \"u-turn\" on GM foods. A precis is published, as with all lobby briefings, on the Downing Street website: </p> <p>\"The journalists were putting their own spin on the prime minister's words in pursuit of their own agendas. This demonstrated one of the reasons why the prime minister believed it was difficult to have a sensible, multi-dimensional debate about a complex issue. The PMOS [prime minister's official spokesman] concluded that coverage of the issue was pathetic.\" </p> <p><strong>TUESDAY </strong></p> <p>Campbell writes to Max Hastings about the London Evening Standard's NHS coverage: </p> <p>\"It would appear to be impossible to get the press to cover policy issues seriously. The headline on the report of the prime minister's speech today, and the report, are exactly the kind of exaggerated, wilful misinterpretation that dogs not just health, but so many other serious policy issues. It is not just the government spokesman but the journalist in me that despairs of today's press.\" </p> <p>Campbell also writes to Tony Hall, the BBC's head of news and current affairs, saying that Monday night's Panorama on the battle to be London's mayor was nothing less than a \"poisonous piece of propaganda\". </p> <p><strong>WEDNESDAY </strong></p> <p>Guardian columnist, Polly Toynbee, ups the ante by revealing the government's plans for the press: </p> <p>\"The government is preparing to launch a full-frontal attack on the press - the prime 'force of conservatism'. Not quite yet, but when the time is right.

      "bodyText": "MONDAY In the lobby, Alastair Campbell gives his verdict on press reports of Tony Blair's \"u-turn\" on GM foods. A precis is published, as with all lobby briefings, on the Downing Street website: \"The journalists were putting their own spin on the prime minister's words in pursuit of their own agendas. This demonstrated one of the reasons why the prime minister believed it was difficult to have a sensible, multi-dimensional debate about a complex issue. The PMOS [prime minister's official spokesman] concluded that coverage of the issue was pathetic.\" TUESDAY Campbell writes to Max Hastings about the London Evening Standard's NHS coverage: \"It would appear to be impossible to get the press to cover policy issues seriously. The headline on the report of the prime minister's speech today, and the report, are exactly the kind of exaggerated, wilful misinterpretation that dogs not just health, but so many other serious policy issues. It is not just the government spokesman but the journalist in me that despairs of today's press.\" Campbell also writes to Tony Hall, the BBC's head of news and current affairs, saying that Monday night's Panorama on the battle to be London's mayor was nothing less than a \"poisonous piece of propaganda\". WEDNESDAY Guardian columnist, Polly Toynbee, ups the ante by revealing the government's plans for the press: \"The government is preparing to launch a full-frontal attack on the press - the prime 'force of conservatism'. Not quite yet, but when the time is right. Now it would look like whingeing while down in a bad news trough: the London mayor debacle, the dome, NHS waiting lists, Section 28, the Afghans and asylum seekers in general . . . But things can only get better, as the old song goes. And when they do, the government intends to spring back off the ropes and punch its enemies on the nose. Not before time, many in the party think.\" FRIDAY Campbell writes an article in the Daily Telegraph about another \"unhealthy\" aspect of today's press: \"The way that so much of the media moves as a herd. It was once media fashion - and still is abroad - to be hugely pro-Blair. The current fashion is broadly to dump on him, the more venomous the better.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Ross Kemp is sipping tea, answering my questions politely in his educated Essex voice. But his grey eyes are wandering. He's tense. Watching the foyer. In the cinema next door, Kemp's first big two-hour drama for ITV, Hero of the Hour, broadcast next Sunday, is playing before an audience of journalists. Kemp, superstar of EastEnders and last seen in October crashing into the Thames to fake death then hopping off to Spain and a dodgy new life, is watching to see if anyone walks out. It's not an act. He is seriously worried. </p> <p>In his new role he is attempting a clean break from 10 years of \"hard man\" typecasting, by playing an ordinary family man, Richie Liddle. He has four kids and is employed as a supermarket security guard. When raiders attack him and shoot him in the leg because he refuses to open the safe he suddenly becomes a national hero. But his heroism is flawed. Why? Because he tried to pocket \u00a3100,000 to pay for an operation for his daughter to remove a large birthmark. Grant Mitchell would never have done that, now would he? </p> <p>\"I see people like that at my rugby club: some turn up in Ferraris, others on bikes,\" Kemp says. \"There is so much pressure on people to succeed, but Richie can't compete. He's not the brightest thing on this earth, not dedicated to his laptop. </p> <p>\"Generally we don't see this sort of character on TV, they're thought not as interesting to people as the person who drives a Ferrari. He's different from Grant Mitchell. And I love the relationship with his daughter.\" </p> <p>After a decade of playing a troubled character who plumbed every dysfunctional storyline - setting fire to his pub for insurance while one wife was upstairs, sleeping with his mother-in-law, and exploiting a tribe of women - Kemp, aged 35, is now trying warm and cuddly. </p> <p>He is not the first soap star to make the leap into comparatively short-run drama. And he won't be the last. Amanda Burton (from Brookside to Silent Witness); Michelle Collins (from EastEnders to Sunburn); Nick Berry (from EastEnders to Heartbeat); and Sarah Lancashire (Coronation Street to Clocking Off) have all made the jump. Television executives have an increasing obsession with stars who can, at least, pull people in for the first episode of a new drama. What viewers do after that is presumably their own business. </p> <p>\"I lay awake at night over this,\" Kemp says of his journey away from the relative safety of Albert Square. \"After 10 years [on EastEnders] there's no way anything is guaranteed as an actor. You'd be incredibly arrogant to believe that. You have to have self-doubt, or you don't achieve. All good actors are pushing themselves to develop what they do. In this Richie has violence done to him, where Grant would have been the one waving the gun. The danger is that he's a bit boring. </p> <p>\"I'd be an absolute fool not to have accepted ITV's offer. It was also what I wanted to do.\" </p> <p>LWT's drama controller Jo Wright, who brokered Kemp's \u00a31.2m deal with the ITV Network Centre, says: \"The most important thing is the first choice you make. You only have one chance. It's very hard coming out of soap, and if you choose [your next project] badly, that can be it.\" </p> <p>\"You have to widen the field you work,\" Kemp says. \"If I played a bloke pushing women down stairs, well . . .\" he shrugs. </p> <p>Wright persuaded him to take on the role, telling him it was a touching, accessible and sweet story. She struck up a close rapport with Mitchell more than two years ago when she was his BBC boss. He confided how he longed to do different things. \"I said I wouldn't mind staying in EastEnders as long as I had occasional exits, to get out and do something else,\" Kemp says. </p> <p>But the BBC had no system for developing its stars, and had no interest in moving him out of EastEnders, apart from belatedly sending him off to try life in the Arctic (he fell through the ice twice - \"that was surviving, not acting,\" he says). </p> <p>\"How you manage talent is crucial,\" says Wright. \"I always thought that was one of the big mistakes of the BBC. Taking the talent out to a big lunch doesn't impress. Talking to talent about a show that is definitely going to happen and that they have an involvement in is very different.\" </p> <p>Kemp's itchy feet also meshed with ITV's insatiable craving for stars: last week it resigned John Thaw for \u00a32.5m, beating off the BBC, and it has scooped up names from Lily Savage to Des Lynam in the past year. </p> <p>Kemp will play a crusading solicitor next in a big Granada series, then a policeman for United News &amp; Media. After that he is returning for a fourth project with LWT. He has written a four-page treatment for a drama, based on a contemporary novel. He wants to do more writing. </p> <p>No one knows for certain how many millions will sample a new programme just because of a star, but 10m is as good an estimate as any. Further, ITV executives accept without question that its audience simply loves stars. </p> <p>The downside, as a Bafta debate last week outlined, is that commissioning editors become so hung up on stars they ruin good projects, rather than using proper casting directors. \"The audience isn't stupid. It can spot a dud,\" says veteran comedy producer Jimmy Mulville of Hat Trick, which made Father Ted and Drop the Dead Donkey. </p> <p>It hopefully won't be a problem for Kemp, an articulate man who says the necessarily forced storylines of EastEnders finally got to him. \"I'm sounding big headed but I had virtually every storyline in the last five to six years. I wouldn't say I had control, but I was able to put input into them.\" </p> <p>It's true, Kemp admits, that a 1997 script had him raping his wife, Tiffany, on Christmas day. He smiles: \"What do you think about that? At twelve, before you have your turkey? I think it was totally wrong, misjudged. No way it was going ahead, unless they could have made it animatronic.\" </p> <p>There is, he says, a continual pressure for sensation and shock. </p> <p>\"How many have now gone for those youthful storylines - affair with teacher, teenage pregnancy? They've always tried to do that, to reflect areas of life, but you are under constant pressure. It's a commodity you know. </p> <p>\"Plagiarism is rife in any art form - if you want to call soaps arts. Shakespeare knew that. There is always an element of retelling stories, or stealing. Storylines in EastEnders are now very similar to ones four years ago. Audiences don't seem to mind that too much, I suppose characters are different. And it's told and written in a quality way. </p> <p>\"But if it's not then it's very easy for people to start saying it was much better when we saw it the first time. </p> <p>\"At the end of EastEnders [filming ended in August] I started being called Grant less, Ross more, and that was weird because Grant gave you that kind of shield; they're talking about something I play, not who I am. </p> <p>\"When people shout Ross in the street I tend to look around, I assume it's people I know.\" </p> <p>Did you get worried that people thought you were like Grant? \"The media love to play up the idea that people can't differentiate between the person and the character. Admittedly some people can't play out of type, but hopefully I wasn't one of those. Some people are very similar to the characters. In their mannerisms. </p> <p>\"People come up to me and say, 'you're Grant Mitchell, do you want a fight?' I say: 'No, Grant Mitchell is in his dressing room in Elstree, go round there if you want'.\" </p> <p>Kemp's girlfriend is Rebekah Wade, deputy editor of the Sun and his on-off fiancee for five years. Does he want to marry her? \"I hope so. I would love to have kids.\" </p> <p>Under her influence he has become media savvy and much more relaxed. \"You can't reject the media in this country. It's impossible to do so like it is in the States. To a certain extent you have to play the game, it's just how far you get into bed, and I think if you start selling stories for money you are walking into the lion's den offering meat. But if you are polite, cordial and sensitive it's all right. I never hide from paparazzi. </p> <p>\"It obviously helps having a girlfriend who is in the media, but I've always treated it with respect. I'm aware of the harm that can be done to you if you don't.\" (In fact his younger brother, Darren, is a BBC journalist about to switch from the Today programme to Panorama.) </p> <p>\"I never used to do any interviews when I was on EastEnders because I saw doing publicity for a programme on three times a week, for an hour and a half, gaining viewing figures when I was in it [he laughs] of 18 or 19m as pointless.\" </p> <p>Has he mellowed since those days? </p> <p>\"Oh, it is stressful. But it's a different kind of stress. When I was in EastEnders it was an ensemble piece, I was the shop steward there, leading the cast as it were. A spokesman. Now all I have to concentrate on doing is being a actor.\"</p>",

They've always tried to do that, to reflect areas of life, but you are under constant pressure. It's a commodity you know. \"Plagiarism is rife in any art form - if you want to call soaps arts. Shakespeare knew that. There is always an element of retelling stories, or stealing. Storylines in EastEnders are now very similar to ones four years ago. Audiences don't seem to mind that too much, I suppose characters are different. And it's told and written in a quality way. \"But if it's not then it's very easy for people to start saying it was much better when we saw it the first time. \"At the end of EastEnders [filming ended in August] I started being called Grant less, Ross more, and that was weird because Grant gave you that kind of shield; they're talking about something I play, not who I am. \"When people shout Ross in the street I tend to look around, I assume it's people I know.\" Did you get worried that people thought you were like Grant? \"The media love to play up the idea that people can't differentiate between the person and the character. Admittedly some people can't play out of type, but hopefully I wasn't one of those. Some people are very similar to the characters. In their mannerisms. \"People come up to me and say, 'you're Grant Mitchell, do you want a fight?' I say: 'No, Grant Mitchell is in his dressing room in Elstree, go round there if you want'.\" Kemp's girlfriend is Rebekah Wade, deputy editor of the Sun and his on-off fiancee for five years. Does he want to marry her? \"I hope so. I would love to have kids.\" Under her influence he has become media savvy and much more relaxed. \"You can't reject the media in this country. It's impossible to do so like it is in the States. To a certain extent you have to play the game, it's just how far you get into bed, and I think if you start selling stories for money you are walking into the lion's den offering meat. But if you are polite, cordial and sensitive it's all right. I never hide from paparazzi. \"It obviously helps having a girlfriend who is in the media, but I've always treated it with respect. I'm aware of the harm that can be done to you if you don't.\" (In fact his younger brother, Darren, is a BBC journalist about to switch from the Today programme to Panorama.) \"I never used to do any interviews when I was on EastEnders because I saw doing publicity for a programme on three times a week, for an hour and a half, gaining viewing figures when I was in it [he laughs] of 18 or 19m as pointless.\" Has he mellowed since those days? \"Oh, it is stressful. But it's a different kind of stress. When I was in EastEnders it was an ensemble piece, I was the shop steward there, leading the cast as it were. A spokesman. Now all I have to concentrate on doing is being a actor.\"",

From Wednesday to Friday it plays host to the Production Show, one of the UK's largest and most influential television, film and advertising fairs. </p> <p>In previous years, the emphasis of the show has been on \"luvvie\" issues such as copyright and how to pitch ideas. But this year the \"luvvies\" have been upstaged by \"nerds\" surfing a wave of technomania, promising not 500 but 500,000 potential television channels in the foreseeable future. </p> <p>The show has been running for 10 years now and this year's is the biggest yet. With 150 exhibitors and sponsors (including the Guardian) and more than 40 different discussions, the organisers say it addresses every aspect of creating, making and financing films of all kinds. Hence its move from the elegant confines of the Islington Business Centre to Olympia. </p> <p>\"The impact of technology on every area of TV, film, advertising and even game production is immense. At the same time, these industries are going through a phase of growth which will change them beyond recognition in a comparatively short time,\" says Tim Macpherson, event director for organisers Emap Media. </p> <p>So for the first time the show is taking a serious look at the potential of \"webcasting\" - using the internet (as opposed to cable, satellite or the airwaves) to disseminate programmes. It's a timely change of emphasis designed to highlight the potential impact of ASDL (asymmetric digital subscriber lines), new super telephone connections that can carry hundreds of times more information than ordinary phone lines, which are due to be launched next month. </p> <p>This means that it will now be possible to send reasonable-quality video images down a phone line. \"As the technology already exists in domestic computers to digitise images, ASDL removes the last obstacle to anyone becoming a global broadcaster from their own home,\" says Jason Thomson, marketing director of internet video company Numedia. </p> <p>This raises the spectre of a 500,000-channel future in which The Fast Show's Channel 9 is a showcase of high production values and consummate craft skills. The implications for the big media corporations are immense, say the nerds. \"The internet service providers and telecoms providers will become the new media barons because they will control the means of distribution,\" predicts Thomson. </p> <p>However, in the short term, there are still significant restrictions on what webcasting can achieve. Limited bandwidth will continue to mean that until fibre-optic connections (1,100 times faster than ASDL) become widespread, the best webcasts will be strong, simple, slow-moving images. </p> <p>Developing programming with these attributes takes special skills, so Numedia will be staging a live demonstration of webcasting, broadcasting vox pops and set-piece features. Such is the demand anticipated by the show's organisers that it has scheduled 45-minute seminars on web production over three days. </p> <p>This reflects the fact that beneath the showbiz glitz of the exhibition lies a significant economic and cultural subtext; the struggle currently going on between the nerds, who believe that computing will become the dominant entertainment mode in the future, and the television industry, which hopes that in years to come computing will be just another channel on your television set. </p> <p>The TV industry is putting its faith in digital television to win the race for convergence. The keynote lecture delivered by Steve Morrison, chief executive of Granada Media Group, will deal with the potential of online broadcasting. Morrison, who has overseen the launch of online entertainment service GWizz, and is also joint chief of the UK edition of the Ask Jeeves search engine and one of the key players behind ONdigital, will look at the opportunities that multimedia content creation presents for producers. </p> <p>Despite the opinion of those like Jason Thomson, who regard digital television as as an evolutionary cul-de-sac - \"just a stepping stone to internet TV, which is more flexible and more interactive,\" he says - it is the cutting edge of broadcasting for at least the foreseeable future. </p> <p>The Production Show will reflect this commercial reality, with debates on interactive opportunities for producers and the opportunities for independents offered by digital production and distribution. Among those taking part will be John Holland, the BBC's head of interactive TV, and Mark Rowland, managing director of Mentorn International. </p> <p>In a session titled Working with Dinosaurs, Jim Hytner, marketing director of Channel 5, will examine the implications for traditional mixed scheduling of a fragmented, view-when-you-like era of niche networks and interactivity. </p> <p>But even the nerdiest of nerds agrees that if anyone can become a global television broadcaster, what will distinguish success from failure is not access to a distribution platform but quality of output. \"Content is king\" is the rallying cry of the luvvies. </p> <p>The leading edge of the show may be to do with technological issues, but Tim Macpherson points out that \"the remaining 70% will still deal with luvvie issues\". To this end, there will be eight sessions with commissioning editors from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Discovery. There will also be sessions on production, including a masterclass with Brookside and Hollyoaks producer Phil Redmond on what he sees as the major issues facing producers in the coming years. </p> <p>But the show is not just about television. The future of advertising will also be addressed in a session examining the effect of the new media revolution on the creative process. A presentation by Joe Stanton, knowledge and futures director at advertising agency Leo Burnett, will explore the impact of new technologies on brands and the consumer. </p> <p>Of course, battling for the future is hungry work. The luvvies will need a lot more than sweaty cheese sandwiches and a styrofoam cup of coffee to fuel their struggle with the nerds.

      "body": "<p>Covering the anti-World Trade Organisation rally at London's Euston Station on November 30 last year was nothing out of the ordinary for Express journalist Danny Penman. He'd reported on Britain's protest movement since the early 90s and seen everything from peaceful treetop occupations at the Newbury bypass to full-scale riots in the capital. </p> <p>The \"N30 event\" - as it was dubbed by the organisers - was to prove different, however. Just after 7pm the police moved in to clear the station concourse, resulting in considerable disorder. Penman found himself herded into a nearby park, where he claims he was viciously attacked by police in riot gear. \"I suddenly found myself being repeatedly struck with batons. I made it clear that I was a journalist, and I couldn't believe it when they continued hitting out at me. I was only rescued after the BBC's Kate Adie intervened.\" Penman suffered cuts and bruises and a broken arm, the bone so severely shattered it required a steel plate and a dozen bolts to hold it together. </p> <p>The incident mirrors the experience of TV researcher Andrew Browning, who claims he was attacked and intimidated by police while photographing last summer's anti-capitalist riot in the City of London. \"I'd shot half a film of the barrage of missiles coming from the protesters and of the retaliatory baton charges by police, when I saw two riot officers swing towards me. Ducking around a wheelie bin, they struck me with their batons across the shoulders and grabbed my camera. I shouted that I was a journalist and asked what on earth they were doing.\" </p> <p>Browning says the police demanded all the films in his possession, threatening him with arrest for violent disorder if he didn't comply - \"totally ridiculous as I was simply taking pictures.\" </p> <p>On the same day, Nick Cobbing, a freelance photographer, says the police deliberately damaged his camera after seizing it during a baton charge. \"I'd dropped it, but was told I'd have to make a statement to claim it back,\" he says. \"When I did recover it, the damage was criminal - shutter punctured, the hood and filter missing - far more than would result from it simply dropping to the floor.\" </p> <p>Penman is attempting to sue the Metropolitan police for assault with the backing of the National Union of Journalists, and Browning and Cobbing have lodged formal complaints with the police complaints authority, seeking to recover the considerable costs of repairing and replacing equipment. Another journalist arrested at the protest, freelance Charlotte Wilcox, is also considering legal action after being held overnight without charge and having her video camera and tape seized. All four are part of a growing list of reporters to fall foul of the law while covering political dissent. </p> <p>Since environmental activists first resorted to direct action at the Twyford Down anti-bypass siege in 1992-93, protests have attracted media attention like never before. With this, however, there has been an alarming increase in the number of journalists reportedly assaulted, harassed and even arrested by the police at such events. </p> <p>Those covering road protests, hunt sabotage and action against genetically modified crops claim to have been targeted most frequently. Some say they have been arrested as many as seven times, others that they have been beaten by police, their houses raided and equipment seized. All say their press card credentials have been systematically ignored, in spite of a police-operated PIN number identification scheme. </p> <p>Some journalists argue that it represents a deliberate and organised attempt on the part of the police to intimidate campaign-sympathetic reporters and to \"manage\" the news. Others maintain that it is simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time - journalists covering illegal protests should expect to encounter problems with the law. </p> <p>Most of the journalists harassed or arrested while covering protests have never been charged. Nick Cobbing has the dubious honour of being one of only two known reporters to have been convicted - he was found guilty of obstruction after reporting from the trees at the 1997 Manchester airport eviction - fuelling speculation that the primary motive of police is not to criminalise journalists outright but to prevent compromising material from being broadcast or published. </p> <p>In July 1998, Ben Edwards, a freelance video journalist, was accused by police of being \"the propaganda arm\" of a group of environmental activists arrested after destroying a field of genetically modified crops in Devon.

      "bodyText": "Covering the anti-World Trade Organisation rally at London's Euston Station on November 30 last year was nothing out of the ordinary for Express journalist Danny Penman. He'd reported on Britain's protest movement since the early 90s and seen everything from peaceful treetop occupations at the Newbury bypass to full-scale riots in the capital. The \"N30 event\" - as it was dubbed by the organisers - was to prove different, however. Just after 7pm the police moved in to clear the station concourse, resulting in considerable disorder. Penman found himself herded into a nearby park, where he claims he was viciously attacked by police in riot gear. \"I suddenly found myself being repeatedly struck with batons. I made it clear that I was a journalist, and I couldn't believe it when they continued hitting out at me. I was only rescued after the BBC's Kate Adie intervened.\" Penman suffered cuts and bruises and a broken arm, the bone so severely shattered it required a steel plate and a dozen bolts to hold it together. The incident mirrors the experience of TV researcher Andrew Browning, who claims he was attacked and intimidated by police while photographing last summer's anti-capitalist riot in the City of London. \"I'd shot half a film of the barrage of missiles coming from the protesters and of the retaliatory baton charges by police, when I saw two riot officers swing towards me. Ducking around a wheelie bin, they struck me with their batons across the shoulders and grabbed my camera. I shouted that I was a journalist and asked what on earth they were doing.\" Browning says the police demanded all the films in his possession, threatening him with arrest for violent disorder if he didn't comply - \"totally ridiculous as I was simply taking pictures.\" On the same day, Nick Cobbing, a freelance photographer, says the police deliberately damaged his camera after seizing it during a baton charge. \"I'd dropped it, but was told I'd have to make a statement to claim it back,\" he says. \"When I did recover it, the damage was criminal - shutter punctured, the hood and filter missing - far more than would result from it simply dropping to the floor.\" Penman is attempting to sue the Metropolitan police for assault with the backing of the National Union of Journalists, and Browning and Cobbing have lodged formal complaints with the police complaints authority, seeking to recover the considerable costs of repairing and replacing equipment. Another journalist arrested at the protest, freelance Charlotte Wilcox, is also considering legal action after being held overnight without charge and having her video camera and tape seized. All four are part of a growing list of reporters to fall foul of the law while covering political dissent. Since environmental activists first resorted to direct action at the Twyford Down anti-bypass siege in 1992-93, protests have attracted media attention like never before. With this, however, there has been an alarming increase in the number of journalists reportedly assaulted, harassed and even arrested by the police at such events. Those covering road protests, hunt sabotage and action against genetically modified crops claim to have been targeted most frequently. Some say they have been arrested as many as seven times, others that they have been beaten by police, their houses raided and equipment seized. All say their press card credentials have been systematically ignored, in spite of a police-operated PIN number identification scheme. Some journalists argue that it represents a deliberate and organised attempt on the part of the police to intimidate campaign-sympathetic reporters and to \"manage\" the news. Others maintain that it is simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time - journalists covering illegal protests should expect to encounter problems with the law. Most of the journalists harassed or arrested while covering protests have never been charged. Nick Cobbing has the dubious honour of being one of only two known reporters to have been convicted - he was found guilty of obstruction after reporting from the trees at the 1997 Manchester airport eviction - fuelling speculation that the primary motive of police is not to criminalise journalists outright but to prevent compromising material from being broadcast or published. In July 1998, Ben Edwards, a freelance video journalist, was accused by police of being \"the propaganda arm\" of a group of environmental activists arrested after destroying a field of genetically modified crops in Devon. He was held in a police cell for more than 24 hours while police raided his house, seizing his computer, files and even documentaries taped from television, although he was never successfully prosecuted. The NUJ says it was the case against Edwards that helped kick-start a campaign to push the issue on to the political agenda - a dossier outlining key incidents and calling for an official policy on the subject has been handed in to the Home Office. The organisation also claims to have identified a police officer who, they believe, has been responsible for intimidating journalists at political demonstrations. Observer photographer Andrew Testa was stopped by the officer at two separate demonstrations, at a Reclaim The Streets event in Birmingham and a vivisection protest in Oxfordshire. \"On both occasions he said he had seen me at other political events, implying that this was somehow illegal.

      "bodyText": "January 1999 \"I am convinced that your administration has the potential to be a great reforming government on a par with those of 1906 and 1945,\" Ken Livingstone tells Tony Blair in the Guardian, publicly declaring his desire to be Labour's candidate for London mayor and asking Mr Blair to \"put an end to the widespread suspicion that the rules are going to be rigged to prevent me contesting the Labour nomination\". May 1999 Ken Livingstone's hope of becoming Labour's candidate for London mayor is boosted when Labour's minister for London, Nick Raynsford, assures the Commons that a ballot to choose the party's official candidate will be decided by one-member-one-vote. August 1999 Keeping up his public profile throughout the summer, Mr Livingstone suggests that if he is not allowed to stand for mayor he could become ill. \"It would be just like Blair to block me from standing as mayor and then offer me a job in his government,\" he says. September 1999 Ken Livingstone launches his official campaign to be Labour's candidate for London mayor against the other declared nominees, Glenda Jackson and Trevor Phillips. Any mention of the Labour party is conspicuous by its absence on his green-and-white policy \"pledge\" card, website and poster campaign. Mr Livingstone's supporters also threaten to mount a legal challenge against the Labour party if he is blocked from standing as Labour's candidate in the mayoral elections. October 1999 A few months after insisting he had no intention of joining the mayoral race and attacking \"anonymous liars\" who claimed he was under pressure to stand, Frank Dobson announces his candidacy for London mayor. October 1999 \"My gut instinct is I will win,\" says Ken Livingstone as Labour rules that it will use an electoral college of MPs, union members and party members, to choose its London mayoral candidate. Mr Livingstone urges Labour MPs to base their decision on what the party members want: \"The policy of the Greater London Labour party as agreed at its conference last June was for a one-member-one-vote ballot of the party membership. This has been replaced with a system where every London Labour MP will wield a vote 1,000 times the size of that of an ordinary party member. In these circumstances I am sure that Labour MPs will feel bound to consult their members before casting their votes,\" he says. November 1999 Despite speculation that the Labour party will block Mr Livingstone from its shortlist, Mr Livingstone survives several fractious party interrogations and his name joins those of Frank Dobson and Glenda Jackson on the list of potential Labour candidates. He is helped by Mr Dobson's threat to resign if Mr Livingstone is not permitted to stand against him in a fair fight. January 2000 Mr Livingstone and Ms Jackson get access to a full list of London Labour party members, nearly three months after Mr Dobson was given exclusive access to the lists, in contravention of party rules. The data protection registrar is called in to investigate Mr Dobson. 20 February 2000 Frank Dobson defeats Mr Livingstone by 51.53% of the electoral college against Mr Livingstone's 48.47%. Mr Livingstone asks Mr Dobson to \"consider his position\" after this \"tainted vote\". Mr Dobson refuses to resign. Mr Livingstone promises to say \"nothing further until I have had a chance to listen to Londoners\". Mr Livingstone's biographer, John Carvel, predicts he will stand.. Journalist, Andrew Rawnsley, calls the two weeks that follow \"the longest tantilize since Salome did her thing for Herod with the seven veils\". 21 February 2000 Ken Livingstone will win 50% of the vote if he stands as an independent against Frank Dobson, who will poll just 22%, an ICM poll finds. 22 February 2000 The Labour party increases the pressure on Mr Livingstone to accept the ballot result by releasing private correspondence from recent months in which he pledged not to stand as an independent and promised to support the party's official candidate. There are rumours that the party hierarchy may ditch Mr Dobson in favour of the popular Mo Mowlam, the Cabinet enforcer, who could be installed as Labour candidate in an emergency move at the end of March. 28 February 2000 Mr Livingstone speaks of a \"comradely\" two-hour meeting with deputy prime minister, John Prescott, as the party continues to pressure the Brent East MP not to go independent. Rumours that Mr Livingstone will be bought off with a minor ministerial job fail to materialise. Two Labour MPs call on Mr Dobson to accept he was not the real winner of Labour's selection and to stand down, but the vast majority of the party lines up behind Mr Dobson. A Labour spokesman says of Mr Livingstone: \"Our intelligence is that he is likely to announce he will run, on Wednesday or Thursday. If he does stand as an independent, we're going to hit him hard. The campaign will be tough and unrelenting.\" 3 March 2000 Mr Livingstone foils Labour \"intelligence\". Despite a confrontation with Mr Dobson on Question Time, he refuses to declare his independent candidacy. 6 March 2000 Ken Livingstone says he will stand as an independent mayoral candidate, an announcement perfectly timed to overshadow the official launch of Frank Dobson's Labour campaign.",

Yet on the other hand, when we try to merge, all proposals are referred to the competition authorities, with share of audience and share of advertising governed by different sets of rules. </p> <p>In the same way, we are promised a light-touch regulatory regime under the new legislation for broadcasting proposed for the next parliament. Yet when we try to rationalise the ITV schedule by moving our main news bulletin to fit the changing viewing habits of our consumers, we are hauled before Commons inquisitors and publicly barracked by the prime minister and the culture secretary. </p> <p>Of course, Gerald Kaufman's latest investigation into News At Ten - following hard on the heels of his committee's reports on BBC funding and the Wembley fiasco - is designed at least as much to win headlines as arguments. His magisterial theatricality is well suited to \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" situations. If you make changes in the schedule that win an extra \u00a370m of annual revenue, are you a hero or a villain? If the overall audience goes up, but the ratings for news and regional programmes goes down, are you applauded or booed? If 24-hour channels and the internet (so close to Gerald's heart) are marginalising the whole idea of fixed news bulletins, why does it matter where a particular bulletin is placed? </p> <p>And what does it have to do with the government, anyway - other than their irritating habit of having views on everything that might be talked about in the pub? (If you remember our Tony on Richard and Judy calling for the Weatherfield One to be freed, you will not have been surprised to see junior minister Yvette Cooper on GMTV this week, wittering on about the latest Coronation Street crisis, Sarah-Lou's teenage pregnancy.) </p> <p>Chris Smith, of course, would say that even ministers responsible for broadcasting are entitled, like all other citizens, to have (and express) views on broadcasting - which is a bit like Leon Brittan urging the BBC governors in the 1980s to ban the controversial programme about Northern Ireland, At the Edge of the Union, disingenuously denying that he was writing in his capacity as home secretary. </p> <p>In fact, the government has no say in deciding whether News At Ten is restored: the power lies solely in the hands of the ITC, which is currently engaged in that very process. But its intervention exposes the weak flank in this administration's entire approach to broadcasting issues. </p> <p>The Davies Report, for all its virtues, was isolated from the political process because its tight timetable and remit ensured that it failed to address the crucial issues that should have set the framework of its approach. What is the role of public sector broadcasting in the digital age? Will a whole range of public service obligations continue to be imposed on ITC-licensed broadcasters, even as the value of their ITC-granted spectrum diminishes? What part does the BBC play in both those arguments? How much funding for the BBC and the public sector as a whole is appropriate in an expanding broadcast market? And how should such funding be generated? </p> <p>Davies was forced into short-term thinking and short-term solutions because the full-scale inquiry into broadcasting was not scheduled until 2002/3 - by which time most of the questions it might have dealt with will have been overtaken by events. The News At Ten affair is another casualty of that procrastination. </p> <p>In practice, it matters little whether or not News At Ten is reinstated. Whatever audience it used to capture will inevitably have been eroded by its year-long absence. Any of the benefits to the schedule of clearing the 10pm roadblock - and there have been disappointingly few - will disappear if the clock is turned back. The Canute-like posturing of ministers will surely be swamped by public indifference, if not the sweep of new viewing opportunities. The compromise being mooted - of a News At Ten-Thirty, head to head with Newsnight - would serve little public purpose, and leave ITV in a half-nelson rather than a full nelson. </p> <p>Like Dr Watson, the ITC would be well advised to listen for the dog that did not bark, rather than the predictable growlings of ministers who should know better. ITV's commercial competitors - who had viewed with some trepidation the prospect of News At Ten's abolition - have been tellingly silent in the run-up to the ITC's decision on reinstatement. ITV's ratings collapse in 2000 - which has caused alarming cost inflation for advertisers - suggests that its decline will not be cured by one bold gesture, however effective that may have been in shoring up ITV's relationship with its customers for a couple of years. And that is the real news.</p> <p>\u0095 David Elstein is chief executive of Channel 5.</p>",

Yet on the other hand, when we try to merge, all proposals are referred to the competition authorities, with share of audience and share of advertising governed by different sets of rules. In the same way, we are promised a light-touch regulatory regime under the new legislation for broadcasting proposed for the next parliament. Yet when we try to rationalise the ITV schedule by moving our main news bulletin to fit the changing viewing habits of our consumers, we are hauled before Commons inquisitors and publicly barracked by the prime minister and the culture secretary. Of course, Gerald Kaufman's latest investigation into News At Ten - following hard on the heels of his committee's reports on BBC funding and the Wembley fiasco - is designed at least as much to win headlines as arguments. His magisterial theatricality is well suited to \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" situations. If you make changes in the schedule that win an extra \u00a370m of annual revenue, are you a hero or a villain? If the overall audience goes up, but the ratings for news and regional programmes goes down, are you applauded or booed? If 24-hour channels and the internet (so close to Gerald's heart) are marginalising the whole idea of fixed news bulletins, why does it matter where a particular bulletin is placed? And what does it have to do with the government, anyway - other than their irritating habit of having views on everything that might be talked about in the pub? (If you remember our Tony on Richard and Judy calling for the Weatherfield One to be freed, you will not have been surprised to see junior minister Yvette Cooper on GMTV this week, wittering on about the latest Coronation Street crisis, Sarah-Lou's teenage pregnancy.) Chris Smith, of course, would say that even ministers responsible for broadcasting are entitled, like all other citizens, to have (and express) views on broadcasting - which is a bit like Leon Brittan urging the BBC governors in the 1980s to ban the controversial programme about Northern Ireland, At the Edge of the Union, disingenuously denying that he was writing in his capacity as home secretary. In fact, the government has no say in deciding whether News At Ten is restored: the power lies solely in the hands of the ITC, which is currently engaged in that very process. But its intervention exposes the weak flank in this administration's entire approach to broadcasting issues. The Davies Report, for all its virtues, was isolated from the political process because its tight timetable and remit ensured that it failed to address the crucial issues that should have set the framework of its approach. What is the role of public sector broadcasting in the digital age? Will a whole range of public service obligations continue to be imposed on ITC-licensed broadcasters, even as the value of their ITC-granted spectrum diminishes? What part does the BBC play in both those arguments? How much funding for the BBC and the public sector as a whole is appropriate in an expanding broadcast market? And how should such funding be generated? Davies was forced into short-term thinking and short-term solutions because the full-scale inquiry into broadcasting was not scheduled until 2002/3 - by which time most of the questions it might have dealt with will have been overtaken by events. The News At Ten affair is another casualty of that procrastination. In practice, it matters little whether or not News At Ten is reinstated. Whatever audience it used to capture will inevitably have been eroded by its year-long absence. Any of the benefits to the schedule of clearing the 10pm roadblock - and there have been disappointingly few - will disappear if the clock is turned back. The Canute-like posturing of ministers will surely be swamped by public indifference, if not the sweep of new viewing opportunities. The compromise being mooted - of a News At Ten-Thirty, head to head with Newsnight - would serve little public purpose, and leave ITV in a half-nelson rather than a full nelson. Like Dr Watson, the ITC would be well advised to listen for the dog that did not bark, rather than the predictable growlings of ministers who should know better. ITV's commercial competitors - who had viewed with some trepidation the prospect of News At Ten's abolition - have been tellingly silent in the run-up to the ITC's decision on reinstatement. ITV's ratings collapse in 2000 - which has caused alarming cost inflation for advertisers - suggests that its decline will not be cured by one bold gesture, however effective that may have been in shoring up ITV's relationship with its customers for a couple of years. And that is the real news. \u0095 David Elstein is chief executive of Channel 5.",

He is the worst enemy of the Zionist entity.\" </p> <p>Darwish, author of My Homeland is a Suitcase and other nationalist poems, returned from 25 years of exile to the West Bank in 1995, although he was banned from entering Israel until last December. </p> <p>While he is pleased at the decision this week to include his work on Israel's high school literature curriculum, he said yesterday that he fears he has become caught up in Israel's culture wars. </p> <p>\"The right are using me to make a scandal, as a pretext to attack the government,\" he said. They are saying: 'How dare they teach the works of a national poet like me who is not in love with Zionism?'\" </p> <p>Mr Rivlin has given the prime minister, Ehud Barak, 48 hours to retreat before calling a vote of confidence in his government. </p> <p>In his opposition to Darwish, Mr Rivlin has drawn support from beyond Israel's right wing, attracting allies from within Mr Barak's ruling coalition, including parties generally regarded as liberal. </p> <p>\"The point is that if I want to teach German then I teach Goethe and Schiller, not Horst Wessel [writer of the poem that became the Nazi anthem],\" said Tommy Lapid, who belongs to the Shinui party, and who is known for his secular views and his battles against the influence of religious parties. </p> <p>\"Why take the most vociferous enemy of this country in order to teach Arab literature. If it was under curricula of history - know your enemy - then this would be acceptable.\" </p> <p>The furore over Darwish's work - which religious parties denounce as \"Bolshevik\" - marks the second time in a week that the unity of Mr Barak's coalition has been put to the test. </p> <p>Last week, three parties defected from the coalition to support an opposition bill that would make it more difficult for Mr Barak to win a future referendum on a possible peace deal with Syria. That vote, too, was the result of anger against Mr Barak's education minister, Yossi Sarid, who has sought to exclude religious parties from any say in schooling. </p> <p>Mr Barak's coalition is unlikely to lose this week's vote - even Mr Rivlin admits opponents of Darwish will translate their displeasure into abstentions - but the showdown is an unwelcome distraction from the prime minister's preoccupation: a peace agreement with Syria, followed by a deal with the Palestinians. </p> <p>Mr Sarid argues that the changes to the high school literary curriculum - the first in 20 years - are intended to reflect Israel's multi-cultural society. Aside from Darwish and other Palestinian poets, he proposes including works by immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and residents of development towns. </p> <p>\"The basis for adding a multicultural curriculum is so every child will be able to find himself, his roots and his culture in what he studies in school,\" Mr Sarid said. \"The Palestinians are part of our life and culture and it's important to know your neighbours.\" </p> <p>Mr Darwish agrees, although he is sceptical that students will be receptive. \"If they read deeply, and in an innocent way, not a political way, they may find we have something in common,\" he said. \"They will know that this country had a history and a culture and a collective memory and this country was not empty when the Zionist project was made.\" </p> <p>But this is precisely the danger of putting Darwish on the curriculum, according to Mr Rivlin, who fears the works would undermine the Zionist premise that Israel was created as an exclusive homeland for the Jews. </p> <p>\"Sarid is really acting the cosmopolitan. He is part of post-Zionism. Many voters of Sarid are part of the Arab people, and he is expressing the idea that there is more to being Israeli than being a Jew,\" he said. \"Once you start talking on the basis that maybe we were not right in creating a Jewish state than those young people also might come to think: 'Maybe Darwish is right, and we should not have come here.' We are in the struggle for the existence of the state of Israel.\"</p>",

In his opposition to Darwish, Mr Rivlin has drawn support from beyond Israel's right wing, attracting allies from within Mr Barak's ruling coalition, including parties generally regarded as liberal. \"The point is that if I want to teach German then I teach Goethe and Schiller, not Horst Wessel [writer of the poem that became the Nazi anthem],\" said Tommy Lapid, who belongs to the Shinui party, and who is known for his secular views and his battles against the influence of religious parties. \"Why take the most vociferous enemy of this country in order to teach Arab literature. If it was under curricula of history - know your enemy - then this would be acceptable.\" The furore over Darwish's work - which religious parties denounce as \"Bolshevik\" - marks the second time in a week that the unity of Mr Barak's coalition has been put to the test. Last week, three parties defected from the coalition to support an opposition bill that would make it more difficult for Mr Barak to win a future referendum on a possible peace deal with Syria. That vote, too, was the result of anger against Mr Barak's education minister, Yossi Sarid, who has sought to exclude religious parties from any say in schooling. Mr Barak's coalition is unlikely to lose this week's vote - even Mr Rivlin admits opponents of Darwish will translate their displeasure into abstentions - but the showdown is an unwelcome distraction from the prime minister's preoccupation: a peace agreement with Syria, followed by a deal with the Palestinians. Mr Sarid argues that the changes to the high school literary curriculum - the first in 20 years - are intended to reflect Israel's multi-cultural society. Aside from Darwish and other Palestinian poets, he proposes including works by immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and residents of development towns. \"The basis for adding a multicultural curriculum is so every child will be able to find himself, his roots and his culture in what he studies in school,\" Mr Sarid said. \"The Palestinians are part of our life and culture and it's important to know your neighbours.\" Mr Darwish agrees, although he is sceptical that students will be receptive. \"If they read deeply, and in an innocent way, not a political way, they may find we have something in common,\" he said. \"They will know that this country had a history and a culture and a collective memory and this country was not empty when the Zionist project was made.\" But this is precisely the danger of putting Darwish on the curriculum, according to Mr Rivlin, who fears the works would undermine the Zionist premise that Israel was created as an exclusive homeland for the Jews. \"Sarid is really acting the cosmopolitan. He is part of post-Zionism. Many voters of Sarid are part of the Arab people, and he is expressing the idea that there is more to being Israeli than being a Jew,\" he said. \"Once you start talking on the basis that maybe we were not right in creating a Jewish state than those young people also might come to think: 'Maybe Darwish is right, and we should not have come here.' We are in the struggle for the existence of the state of Israel.\"",

      "body": "<p>What's short, funny and five years old? No, not the latest member of the Macaulkin acting clan, but the Reduced Shakespeare Company, about to begin another year in the West End with their 97-minute version of The Complete Works of Williams Shakespeare (Abridged). Andrew Lloyd Webber knows a thing or two about long runs in the West End, but it's rare for a non-musical to get a longevity prize. Except, of course, The Mousetrap. </p> <p>RSC's American co-founder Adam Long rocks with laughter at the idea that his brainchild - a sort of Marx Brothers meets Shakespeare on speed - might be bracketed with that old creaker. \"What matters is that we genuinely connect with an audience,\" he says. </p> <p>The RSC came out of early-80s street theatre in California. \"There were these Renaissance Faires,\" says Long, \"run by a bunch of deadheads and Ken Kesey leftovers who used to re-create Elizabethan villages in the woods at weekends. I had a stuffed dog that I used to do an acrobatic act with at the time.\" Some friends were doing a four-person version of Hamlet, when the female member of the cast broke her ankle; Long had seen the show twice and offered to go on, donning a wig and false bosoms as Ophelia. He stayed with the group, and he and two of the cast developed the idea that became the RSC. \"We were just sitting around one afternoon and a friend suggested we did the complete works of Shakespeare. It sounded like such a funky idea that we said, 'Yeah, why not.' \" </p> <p>That was 1986 and Long, then a political activist and an accountant (no, really), wrote the show with Jess Winfield, a law worker, and Daniel Singer, a graphic artist, never expecting it to be \"more than a laugh at weekends\". They took it to the Edinburgh fringe the following few years and it took off. The RSC toured the US, Japan and the UK, then a year-long residency followed at the Arts Theatre in London, moving to what now looks like their permanent home at the Criterion Theatre at Piccadilly Circus in 1986. On Wednesday they celebrate five years in the West End with a charity gala. </p> <p>It's probably true that only Americans would have had the chutzpah to meddle with Britain's greatest playwright. \"Americans aren't afraid of making fools of themselves,\" says Long. \"But it's not Shakespeare we're sending up, it's ourselves. We're commenting on the mentality of Americans, who can barely deal with anything that's longer than 90 seconds.\" Perhaps \"with no respect for institutions\" Long and co were able to cut through to Shakespeare's core. \"We first condensed the plots of every play, but quickly realised that was impossible because we could only devote two minutes to each. Then Daniel worked out that the comedies all had the same plot devices - twins, mistaken identities, fairies' spells - which could be mushed into one massive play - the Tale of Two Well-measured Gentlemen Lost in the Merry Wives of Venice on Midsummer's Twelfth Night in Winter.\" In their most inspired segment, the histories are presented as an American football game, with the crown of England being passed from one generation to another and Lear being sent off as a \"fictional character on the field\". Is such minimalising like the high-concept pitch for a Hollywood movie, in which Hamlet would be \"Denmark: crazy place, crazy people\"? Long laughs. \"We're not quite as canny as that. It's more like a 10-year-old was trying to sell it, so it would be: \"There's this guy and his father's dead and he doesn't know what to do and he ends up killing everybody and he dies too and it's over'.' </p> <p>The RSC's audiences are a strange mix of home-grown fans, school parties and tourists. Now their show forms part of the tourist trail, but also provides welcome slapstick relief for teachers trying to engage bored pupils with the Bard. For their efforts, they are routinely picked on during the show's audience participation section. </p> <p>The RSC has spawned many imitators; every year, there is a slew of student groups at the Edinburgh fringe with reduced this, abridged that in their titles. Long's perfection of the genre has led to some interesting commissions - he was invited to do a reduced history of the Labour Party for its recent centenary, but had to cry off. \"I would have had to use the word 'socialism'. So I passed.\" </p> <p>The Reduced Shakespeare Company performs at the Criterion Theatre, London W1. Box office: 0171-369 1747.</p>",

The RSC came out of early-80s street theatre in California. \"There were these Renaissance Faires,\" says Long, \"run by a bunch of deadheads and Ken Kesey leftovers who used to re-create Elizabethan villages in the woods at weekends. I had a stuffed dog that I used to do an acrobatic act with at the time.\" Some friends were doing a four-person version of Hamlet, when the female member of the cast broke her ankle; Long had seen the show twice and offered to go on, donning a wig and false bosoms as Ophelia. He stayed with the group, and he and two of the cast developed the idea that became the RSC. \"We were just sitting around one afternoon and a friend suggested we did the complete works of Shakespeare. It sounded like such a funky idea that we said, 'Yeah, why not.' \" That was 1986 and Long, then a political activist and an accountant (no, really), wrote the show with Jess Winfield, a law worker, and Daniel Singer, a graphic artist, never expecting it to be \"more than a laugh at weekends\". They took it to the Edinburgh fringe the following few years and it took off. The RSC toured the US, Japan and the UK, then a year-long residency followed at the Arts Theatre in London, moving to what now looks like their permanent home at the Criterion Theatre at Piccadilly Circus in 1986. On Wednesday they celebrate five years in the West End with a charity gala. It's probably true that only Americans would have had the chutzpah to meddle with Britain's greatest playwright. \"Americans aren't afraid of making fools of themselves,\" says Long. \"But it's not Shakespeare we're sending up, it's ourselves. We're commenting on the mentality of Americans, who can barely deal with anything that's longer than 90 seconds.\" Perhaps \"with no respect for institutions\" Long and co were able to cut through to Shakespeare's core. \"We first condensed the plots of every play, but quickly realised that was impossible because we could only devote two minutes to each. Then Daniel worked out that the comedies all had the same plot devices - twins, mistaken identities, fairies' spells - which could be mushed into one massive play - the Tale of Two Well-measured Gentlemen Lost in the Merry Wives of Venice on Midsummer's Twelfth Night in Winter.\" In their most inspired segment, the histories are presented as an American football game, with the crown of England being passed from one generation to another and Lear being sent off as a \"fictional character on the field\". Is such minimalising like the high-concept pitch for a Hollywood movie, in which Hamlet would be \"Denmark: crazy place, crazy people\"? Long laughs. \"We're not quite as canny as that. It's more like a 10-year-old was trying to sell it, so it would be: \"There's this guy and his father's dead and he doesn't know what to do and he ends up killing everybody and he dies too and it's over'.' The RSC's audiences are a strange mix of home-grown fans, school parties and tourists. Now their show forms part of the tourist trail, but also provides welcome slapstick relief for teachers trying to engage bored pupils with the Bard. For their efforts, they are routinely picked on during the show's audience participation section. The RSC has spawned many imitators; every year, there is a slew of student groups at the Edinburgh fringe with reduced this, abridged that in their titles. Long's perfection of the genre has led to some interesting commissions - he was invited to do a reduced history of the Labour Party for its recent centenary, but had to cry off. \"I would have had to use the word 'socialism'. So I passed.\" The Reduced Shakespeare Company performs at the Criterion Theatre, London W1. Box office: 0171-369 1747.",

      "bodyText": "British internet users will today be offered free access to the internet once they have paid an initial fee of about \u00a330. The move by the American company AltaVista may herald a revolution in internet use in Britain if it prompts a spate of copy-cat offers. AltaVista, an internet search engine specialist, plans to offer British users what Americans take for granted.Once a user has paid the initial fee, it will give them connection to a freephone 0800 number for internet use. It expects to recoup the money from advertising on the web sites. The service will be announced today and is expected to be up and running in a few months. The company will initially limit the number of free surfers to 500,000 to prevent system overload. Other companies have launched flat rate services, but AltaVista says this is the first single-fee deal. It is estimated that the new deal could save Britain's 17m internet users up to \u00a3700m a year in telephone charges. It could woo millions more Britons on to the net. At present about a quarter of Britain is connected to the internet, but we still lag way behind the United States, where almost half of the country uses the web regularly. In the US local calls are free and computer users, connected to a local server, can surf for free. Most service providers charge a monthly fee, but Americans still pay about half as much as their British counterparts when it comes to using the internet. Telephone costs mean that British internet users only spend an average of 17 minutes a day online. This limited use has been blamed for stifling British web firms, which struggle to keep up with their competitors in the US. In America many surfers leave their computers online around the clock, and they are much more likely to buy services or products via the internet. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, should be pleased with the new service because he told financiers last month that high call charges were to blame for doubling the cost of web surfing in Britain. British Telecom had reacted angrily to the chancellor's comments, but a ruling by the telecom watchdog, Oftel, last December means that BT can no longer dictate the call charges that internet providers hand down to their customers. BT recently launched its own web deal, offering free off-peak surfing for a flat rate of \u00a36 .99 a month, or unlimited surfing for a monthly fee of \u00a334.99. The new AltaVista deal will mean that BT and other internet providers may have to reconsider their offers or face an exodus of customers. When Freeserve first offered call-charge-only internet access, its competitors rushed to provide similar services. Freeserve became the country's favourite service provider because it stole a march on its rivals. The internet industry will be keen not to let AltaVista do the same.",

Officers hunting the coastline for the woman's clothing have found nothing so far. Mr Braddy said an investigation into tidal conditions had revealed that the woman must have gone into the water in the Kessingland area if she had been in the sea for less than 48 hours. \"If she had been in the sea for any longer she could have gone into the water some distance away in either direction,\" he added. \"We cannot rule out that she might have gone into the sea in outlying waters away from the coast, possibly from a boat or ship.\"",

      "body": "<p>It is one of the most important questions you have to face. You are setting up an internet business. Everybody tells you that marketing and advertising the site will make or break you. There is no point having a good idea if nobody hears about it. </p> <p>So you siphon off a large part of your launch budget for the purposes of building your brand. Domination of your market is what you seek. And to achieve that you pay advertising companies lots of money to tell the world that you have arrived. </p> <p>But does it work? Advertising and media agencies up and down the country have certainly enjoyed a windfall over the past few months. But new figures revealed here show that many companies, whatever they spend on advertising their wares, are not getting the immediate brand recognition they crave. </p> <p>As we all know, brand is king. \"The only effective barrier to entry in e-commerce is branding,\" says Simon Murdoch of Amazon. David Taylor, head of digital branding at the Added Value Company, a leading brand consultancy, concurs. \"Dot com companies have a real need to develop a clear positioning and identity to survive and prosper in the long run.\" </p> <p>Data from ACNielsen MMS, which records advertising expenditure, shows that online companies spent in excess of \u00a3150m on advertising in 1999 - not including direct mail, spon sorship or promotions. This has all been spent advertising online brands in the real world of traditional media. It represents a threefold increase in what was spent in 1998. However the issue now is whether these companies are getting value for money. </p> <p>This should cause some alarm for online companies because what naturally preoccupies all advertisers is how effective their advertising spend actually is. One key measure of advertising effectiveness is awareness of the brand amongst the public. Research undertaken in the last two weeks by CIA MediaLab as part of its Sensor study has analysed what the UK's major online companies spend on advertisers and compared it to people's awareness of the brand. </p> <p>What is clear from this analysis is that the public's awareness of your brand and the amount you actually spend on advertising are certainly related. But, more worryingly for those spending precious resources telling the public \"We're here!\", some brands have got more recognition bang for their advertising buck. </p> <p>Let's look at the figures. Four major brands, AOL, Yahoo!, Freeserve and BT, all achieve awareness of over 40% amongst the UK adult population. The amount each has spent on advertising differs hugely, raising the question: who has the most effective advertising? Of course the level of recognition also reflects other factors such as the time since each launched and the amount of press coverage they have received. </p> <p>Looking specifically at internet service providers (ISPs) we find that AOL has only been outspent by Freeserve. The two have very similar awareness levels despite the fact that AOL has been around much longer than Freeserve. AOL's recent merger with Time Warner will certainly have helped general awareness levels. What is clear is that Freeserve has been more aggressively going after market share, but AOL has decided to fight back with a spend of around \u00a31.4m in the past two months. </p> <p>It should be made clear that advertising needs to play a different role in the marketing mix as the brand moves through its cycle from an initial launch, to growth to maturity. These ISPs are still growing but are using advertising to help attract both existing and new internet users. </p> <p>The fascinating part of all this is not only trying to work out why differing levels of advertising spend have delivered different results, but also why so many companies are spending so much on advertising. The perception is that there is currently an opportunity to build online brands, and thus market share, more quickly and easily (and cheaply) than in a year or two's time when the internet will be a bigger place. When a market is being launched it is cheaper to buy a share while it is still small than try and steal it off competitors once the market has matured. It is for this reason that venture capitalists are keen to give promising young internet start-ups large sums of money to spend advertising their brand before someone else gets into that sector of the market. </p> <p>A prime example of the advantage of being first to market can be seen in the differences in awareness levels and advertising spend between Amazon and BOL. Despite spending nearly \u00a33.7m on advertising in the last 12 months BOL only has an awareness of 27% amongst people who used the internet in the past month. This compares to a significantly higher awareness of 75% for Amazon from a slightly smaller spend. </p> <p>Maintaining awareness is an easier job than gaining it in the first place. Also, the amount BOL has spent on advertising does not compare favourably to other online brands such as Lastminute which has a 29% awareness from a \u00a31m spend. Meanwhile, online retailer Boo has spent more than \u00a3750,000 in the past two months and has failed to show any significant change in awareness amongst CIA's sample. </p> <p>To be fair, asking people whether they are aware of a brand at a particular moment in time is a relatively crude measure of advertising effec tiveness. However, doing it amongst a pre-defined target audience that has been agreed by the brand owners and the media agency is a good place to start, but media agencies do get judged by the awareness they deliver. Even so, as for AOL and Freeserve, achieving awareness may only be the first part of the advertising process. As well as achieving awareness, advertising needs to communicate some brand values which should help drive share and loyalty. </p> <p>The temptation for brands is to launch with a fanfare to the world, but without any budget left they cannot follow it up. The result is that brand awareness will quickly decay. It could be argued that some brands should use their advertising budget more wisely. </p> <p>Media agencies could more accurately target the right consumers, possibly using other media and over a longer period of time, thus satisfying the joint media requirements of frequency of advertising exposure and recency. But does this excite investors, or the MD, as much as blowing the annual budget on a few weeks of high-profile TV advertising? </p> <p>One sector that is moving wholeheartedly online is banking, and its experience with advertising and brand building holds some important lessons. As yet unreleased research by CIA shows that amongst those that have already opened an online bank account or who intend to open one in the next year, 89% of those aware of Egg say it appeals to them as a brand. This compares to only 60% for the parent brand Prudential. The Smile brand appeals to 70% of those aware of it in this target audience compared to 58% for parent Co-operative Bank. Smile has shown impressive awareness growth in the last two months on the back of a \u00a31.2m advertising budget. </p> <p>Advertising is clearly establishing new values for a new brand while trying not to cannibalise the existing customer base of the parent. </p> <p>As the internet audience grows, then so the amount brands will be encouraged to spend on advertising will increase until those that can't afford to play the spend game drop out or get bought up. Make sure your brand works. Spend money on advertising. But make sure it works.</p> <p>\u0095 Oliver Rowe is operations manager at CIA MediaLab. <a href=\"mailto:ORowe@cia-group.com\">ORowe@cia-group.com</a></p>",

But new figures revealed here show that many companies, whatever they spend on advertising their wares, are not getting the immediate brand recognition they crave. As we all know, brand is king. \"The only effective barrier to entry in e-commerce is branding,\" says Simon Murdoch of Amazon. David Taylor, head of digital branding at the Added Value Company, a leading brand consultancy, concurs. \"Dot com companies have a real need to develop a clear positioning and identity to survive and prosper in the long run.\" Data from ACNielsen MMS, which records advertising expenditure, shows that online companies spent in excess of \u00a3150m on advertising in 1999 - not including direct mail, spon sorship or promotions. This has all been spent advertising online brands in the real world of traditional media. It represents a threefold increase in what was spent in 1998. However the issue now is whether these companies are getting value for money. This should cause some alarm for online companies because what naturally preoccupies all advertisers is how effective their advertising spend actually is. One key measure of advertising effectiveness is awareness of the brand amongst the public. Research undertaken in the last two weeks by CIA MediaLab as part of its Sensor study has analysed what the UK's major online companies spend on advertisers and compared it to people's awareness of the brand. What is clear from this analysis is that the public's awareness of your brand and the amount you actually spend on advertising are certainly related. But, more worryingly for those spending precious resources telling the public \"We're here!\", some brands have got more recognition bang for their advertising buck. Let's look at the figures. Four major brands, AOL, Yahoo!, Freeserve and BT, all achieve awareness of over 40% amongst the UK adult population. The amount each has spent on advertising differs hugely, raising the question: who has the most effective advertising? Of course the level of recognition also reflects other factors such as the time since each launched and the amount of press coverage they have received. Looking specifically at internet service providers (ISPs) we find that AOL has only been outspent by Freeserve. The two have very similar awareness levels despite the fact that AOL has been around much longer than Freeserve. AOL's recent merger with Time Warner will certainly have helped general awareness levels. What is clear is that Freeserve has been more aggressively going after market share, but AOL has decided to fight back with a spend of around \u00a31.4m in the past two months. It should be made clear that advertising needs to play a different role in the marketing mix as the brand moves through its cycle from an initial launch, to growth to maturity. These ISPs are still growing but are using advertising to help attract both existing and new internet users. The fascinating part of all this is not only trying to work out why differing levels of advertising spend have delivered different results, but also why so many companies are spending so much on advertising. The perception is that there is currently an opportunity to build online brands, and thus market share, more quickly and easily (and cheaply) than in a year or two's time when the internet will be a bigger place. When a market is being launched it is cheaper to buy a share while it is still small than try and steal it off competitors once the market has matured. It is for this reason that venture capitalists are keen to give promising young internet start-ups large sums of money to spend advertising their brand before someone else gets into that sector of the market. A prime example of the advantage of being first to market can be seen in the differences in awareness levels and advertising spend between Amazon and BOL. Despite spending nearly \u00a33.7m on advertising in the last 12 months BOL only has an awareness of 27% amongst people who used the internet in the past month. This compares to a significantly higher awareness of 75% for Amazon from a slightly smaller spend. Maintaining awareness is an easier job than gaining it in the first place. Also, the amount BOL has spent on advertising does not compare favourably to other online brands such as Lastminute which has a 29% awareness from a \u00a31m spend. Meanwhile, online retailer Boo has spent more than \u00a3750,000 in the past two months and has failed to show any significant change in awareness amongst CIA's sample. To be fair, asking people whether they are aware of a brand at a particular moment in time is a relatively crude measure of advertising effec tiveness. However, doing it amongst a pre-defined target audience that has been agreed by the brand owners and the media agency is a good place to start, but media agencies do get judged by the awareness they deliver. Even so, as for AOL and Freeserve, achieving awareness may only be the first part of the advertising process. As well as achieving awareness, advertising needs to communicate some brand values which should help drive share and loyalty. The temptation for brands is to launch with a fanfare to the world, but without any budget left they cannot follow it up. The result is that brand awareness will quickly decay. It could be argued that some brands should use their advertising budget more wisely. Media agencies could more accurately target the right consumers, possibly using other media and over a longer period of time, thus satisfying the joint media requirements of frequency of advertising exposure and recency. But does this excite investors, or the MD, as much as blowing the annual budget on a few weeks of high-profile TV advertising? One sector that is moving wholeheartedly online is banking, and its experience with advertising and brand building holds some important lessons. As yet unreleased research by CIA shows that amongst those that have already opened an online bank account or who intend to open one in the next year, 89% of those aware of Egg say it appeals to them as a brand. This compares to only 60% for the parent brand Prudential. The Smile brand appeals to 70% of those aware of it in this target audience compared to 58% for parent Co-operative Bank. Smile has shown impressive awareness growth in the last two months on the back of a \u00a31.2m advertising budget. Advertising is clearly establishing new values for a new brand while trying not to cannibalise the existing customer base of the parent. As the internet audience grows, then so the amount brands will be encouraged to spend on advertising will increase until those that can't afford to play the spend game drop out or get bought up. Make sure your brand works. Spend money on advertising. But make sure it works. \u0095 Oliver Rowe is operations manager at CIA MediaLab. ORowe@cia-group.com",

      "body": "<p>The telephone calls started a few weeks after I moved to the US last year. Several times a week, my home answering machine would repeat chirpy messages from strangers telling me about some offer I would be a fool to turn down. </p> <p>It was annoying but also profoundly disturbing. I had no idea how these people knew my name or home telephone number. Then a friend told me that the next time a salesperson called, I should cite my legal right to have my details erased from their telemarketing lists. It worked and I've only had a handful of calls since. </p> <p>The problem with the internet and the wealth of personal information collected about us online is that few of my friends, or anyone else's, know exactly how to stop businesses collecting personal information and doing what they want with it. </p> <p>This basic sense of unease about the amount of information being gathered and lack of control over it has been one of the biggest failures of online companies to date. For the first time, companies are able to track our behaviour as well as buy our vital statistics and their use of such information is still unclear. Chief among the culprits are online advertisers, who sell information about users to enable their clients to target advertising. </p> <p>Last month, US regulators launched an investigation into <a href=\"http://www.doubleclick.com\" target=\"_new\">DoubleClick</a>, the world's biggest online advertising company, because of its plans to link the surfing habits of individuals to their personal information. The public outcry has forced the company to delay its plans until new privacy standards are agreed. </p> <p>But it has argued that its sophisticated tracking capabilities ultimately benefit consumers who want to receive relevant ads. On a broader level, it accuses anti-ad web surfers of being naive because ads keep the web free. </p> <p>This argument, which touches on the much larger issue of online privacy in general, could shape the way the web is used by media and information companies. </p> <p>These industries tend to base their business plans on the sale of personal information and are busily working out how best to capitalise on the new information-gathering potential of the web. </p> <p>My telephone headaches could have come from the welter of sub scriptions I took out on arriving in New York, as well as from the number of new services I signed up for. </p> <p>Europans enjoy greater legal protection against privacy invasion. But the row over DoubleClick suggests that there is still a need for more information and clarification about an issue which leaves most either nonplussed or vaguely worried. </p> <p>A draft European privacy directive is set to insist that all online companies notify consumers about what information they are collecting and provide them with the choice of opting out. </p> <p>The problem with notification is that a company's privacy policy is hardly the first thing that jumps out of a typical home page. How many people have ever bothered to find one, let alone read it and opt out before buying that belated birthday present? </p> <p>DoubleClick, which has agreements with more than 1,300 websites in 22 different countries, says that about 15 people a day opt out of its data collection scheme. The company argues that this low figure reflects the fact that people like targeted ads - fly fishermen receiving information on rods, one assumes. But it also reflects the fact that few people realise that DoubleClick exists, let alone that it is able to collect a vast amount of information about them. </p> <p>We do not have to read and refuse every company's online information policies. We can also follow an apparently simple procedure of changing our identities (\"cookies\") on our computers so that we are no longer recognised by individual websites. </p> <p>The essential problem with this approach is that the vast majority of people in the UK and US think of cookies as either chocolate chip or plain rather than a piece of computer code. </p> <p> Once you do disable your individual identification biscuits you also wipe out your web preferences. In simple terms, this could mean that you would have to type in your password every time you clicked onto your favourite website. </p> <p>Advocates of privacy argue that this is a small price to pay, but I'm not so sure. The problem is that most people want their web surfing to speed up, not slow down. </p> <p>Most people who accept advertising as a necessary online evil would rather be targeted by ads about things they're interested in. The problem starts when this activity appears secret - as with DoubleClick - or becomes annoying, as with the home phone calls. In both cases, acquiring our own information can often make the problem go away. </p> <p>Online companies would be wise to compete for the clearest, most obvious privacy policies as well as the cheapest prices. Most companies produce a privacy statement but fail to advertise it. Events over the past few weeks have suggested that they should.</p>",

Several times a week, my home answering machine would repeat chirpy messages from strangers telling me about some offer I would be a fool to turn down. It was annoying but also profoundly disturbing. I had no idea how these people knew my name or home telephone number. Then a friend told me that the next time a salesperson called, I should cite my legal right to have my details erased from their telemarketing lists. It worked and I've only had a handful of calls since. The problem with the internet and the wealth of personal information collected about us online is that few of my friends, or anyone else's, know exactly how to stop businesses collecting personal information and doing what they want with it. This basic sense of unease about the amount of information being gathered and lack of control over it has been one of the biggest failures of online companies to date. For the first time, companies are able to track our behaviour as well as buy our vital statistics and their use of such information is still unclear. Chief among the culprits are online advertisers, who sell information about users to enable their clients to target advertising. Last month, US regulators launched an investigation into DoubleClick, the world's biggest online advertising company, because of its plans to link the surfing habits of individuals to their personal information. The public outcry has forced the company to delay its plans until new privacy standards are agreed. But it has argued that its sophisticated tracking capabilities ultimately benefit consumers who want to receive relevant ads. On a broader level, it accuses anti-ad web surfers of being naive because ads keep the web free. This argument, which touches on the much larger issue of online privacy in general, could shape the way the web is used by media and information companies. These industries tend to base their business plans on the sale of personal information and are busily working out how best to capitalise on the new information-gathering potential of the web. My telephone headaches could have come from the welter of sub scriptions I took out on arriving in New York, as well as from the number of new services I signed up for. Europans enjoy greater legal protection against privacy invasion. But the row over DoubleClick suggests that there is still a need for more information and clarification about an issue which leaves most either nonplussed or vaguely worried. A draft European privacy directive is set to insist that all online companies notify consumers about what information they are collecting and provide them with the choice of opting out. The problem with notification is that a company's privacy policy is hardly the first thing that jumps out of a typical home page. How many people have ever bothered to find one, let alone read it and opt out before buying that belated birthday present? DoubleClick, which has agreements with more than 1,300 websites in 22 different countries, says that about 15 people a day opt out of its data collection scheme. The company argues that this low figure reflects the fact that people like targeted ads - fly fishermen receiving information on rods, one assumes. But it also reflects the fact that few people realise that DoubleClick exists, let alone that it is able to collect a vast amount of information about them. We do not have to read and refuse every company's online information policies. We can also follow an apparently simple procedure of changing our identities (\"cookies\") on our computers so that we are no longer recognised by individual websites. The essential problem with this approach is that the vast majority of people in the UK and US think of cookies as either chocolate chip or plain rather than a piece of computer code. Once you do disable your individual identification biscuits you also wipe out your web preferences. In simple terms, this could mean that you would have to type in your password every time you clicked onto your favourite website. Advocates of privacy argue that this is a small price to pay, but I'm not so sure. The problem is that most people want their web surfing to speed up, not slow down. Most people who accept advertising as a necessary online evil would rather be targeted by ads about things they're interested in. The problem starts when this activity appears secret - as with DoubleClick - or becomes annoying, as with the home phone calls. In both cases, acquiring our own information can often make the problem go away. Online companies would be wise to compete for the clearest, most obvious privacy policies as well as the cheapest prices. Most companies produce a privacy statement but fail to advertise it. Events over the past few weeks have suggested that they should.",

I won and stayed in a 1,500-ft square suite.\" Working at a computer terminal all day can be monotonous - and unhealthy too. Herrera offers the following tips: * If you are working long hours, it is important to take regular breaks. * If possible, do some other aspect of your job such as filing during those gaps. Stretch your legs, or go and get a drink. * Go easy on the eyes: blink often, and take regular screen breaks. * It helps if you have a radio in the office, and even if you play it at a low level it passes the time. * Maintain good posture: sit upright without slouching into the back of your chair. Use a footstool for further comfort. * Have something inspiring on your desk, be it a small plant, a flower, a picture or a book. * Get out at lunchtime and go for a walk, no matter how short.",

Wouldn't it be great if you could watch the telly? Now that a test group of 100 cabs has been fitted with screens, that prospect is a little closer. CabVision offers a selection of programmes, from tourist information to music and classic comedy, to alleviate the gridlock boredom. It is expected to be in 1,000 cabs by the end of this year. </p> <p>Jackie Cleary, 28, joined the company behind CabVision as it began to develop the technology and content for the project. As PA to Richard Dale, managing director at MEI Design, she has been involved in CabVision's production and management from its inception through to launch. </p> <p>Cleary's route to her current post was circuitous. After leaving school she had a range of casual jobs - but knew that being a barmaid was not her long-term career choice. She invested in an intensive computer course and joined a financial services company as a 'junior'. \"Because I'd had a few career false starts, I was a bit old to be a junior really, but that was the position my skills and experience merited. Being surrounded by school leavers actually made me more determined to learn quickly and move on.\" </p> <p>She progressed through the administrative and secretarial ranks over the next four years to become PA to the director. When her boss took a promotion at a new private bank, Cleary was invited to go with her. But despite enjoying the job, she soon realised that her opportunities to progress any further in the finance industry were limited. Her boss was very encouraging about her need to make a move, recommending Cleary to colleagues in other industries. MEI was a client and when Dale heard of Cleary's plans to change direction, he 'poached' her to become his own PA. </p> <p>Even though she had some prior knowledge of the company, Cleary found the first couple of months working in a new industry quite a shock. \"Initially, I just didn't know where to start. The financial services sector tends to be ordered and routine, but here I never know what to expect when I walk into the office.\" </p> <p>As well as performing PA functions such as diary management, Cleary can get involved in any aspect of a client project. She spends a lot of time on the phone, researching videos and CDs for soundtracks and showreels and sourcing props for conferences and exhibitions. One of her more unusual projects was finding 500 square metres of wind permeable material to be made into a huge All Blacks rugby shirt during the rugby world cup, and then coordinating an abseiling team to rig it up on the side of New Zealand house. For CabVision, some of Cleary's tasks involved liaising with the BBC to organise footage for the in-car entertainment sequence and helping with the additional filming by going up and down Bond Street acquiring empty designer carrier bags for the shopping stills. </p> <p>\"I feel that the work I do here is much more visible. CabVision is a good example of that and the rugby shirt stunt was a great success - I can actually see the results of my efforts. I like the range of clients and events, working with sporting manufacturers and nightclubs on launches and publicity drives is infinitely more sexy than the bank. I also really appreciate the informal atmosphere and the buzz of being located in Covent Garden.\" </p> <p>Cleary has also discovered the advantages of working in a small organisation. \"I am learning all the time by getting involved with as many projects as I can. There isn't a career structure here as such, but it is easier to have your efforts spotted and rewarded than in a large, hierarchical organisation. I want to progress from doing the legwork and into production, liaising with clients and managing projects myself. The marketing director started in my job 10 years ago and now owns part of the company, which I find very encouraging.\"</p>",

The financial services sector tends to be ordered and routine, but here I never know what to expect when I walk into the office.\" As well as performing PA functions such as diary management, Cleary can get involved in any aspect of a client project. She spends a lot of time on the phone, researching videos and CDs for soundtracks and showreels and sourcing props for conferences and exhibitions. One of her more unusual projects was finding 500 square metres of wind permeable material to be made into a huge All Blacks rugby shirt during the rugby world cup, and then coordinating an abseiling team to rig it up on the side of New Zealand house. For CabVision, some of Cleary's tasks involved liaising with the BBC to organise footage for the in-car entertainment sequence and helping with the additional filming by going up and down Bond Street acquiring empty designer carrier bags for the shopping stills. \"I feel that the work I do here is much more visible. CabVision is a good example of that and the rugby shirt stunt was a great success - I can actually see the results of my efforts. I like the range of clients and events, working with sporting manufacturers and nightclubs on launches and publicity drives is infinitely more sexy than the bank. I also really appreciate the informal atmosphere and the buzz of being located in Covent Garden.\" Cleary has also discovered the advantages of working in a small organisation. \"I am learning all the time by getting involved with as many projects as I can. There isn't a career structure here as such, but it is easier to have your efforts spotted and rewarded than in a large, hierarchical organisation. I want to progress from doing the legwork and into production, liaising with clients and managing projects myself. The marketing director started in my job 10 years ago and now owns part of the company, which I find very encouraging.\"",

Railtrack stressed that the plan before the SSRA was either for SWT to build double decker trains, or for platforms to be lengthened at Waterloo to accommodate longer trains.

Double decker trains have been used before in parts of Kent, but only on a limited basis.

Railtrack, which is examining the development of double decker trains in France and other parts of mainland Europe, said that adjustments would probably have to be made to tracks and bridges. \"The main difference between a normal train and a double decker is that passengers usually step down on to a double decker,' said a spokesman.

      "body": "<p>We all love a good moan, and for those on the left there were few better subjects to moan about in the 80s and 90s than the unemployment figures. Month after month Labour raged at the way the Conservatives lopped people off the dole queue by moving the goalposts. Fiddle, they said, as the claimant count was reduced by making groups ineligible for benefit. Insult to the real unemployed, they claimed, as the out of work were re-classified as long-term sick.</p> <p> That particular avenue of enjoyment has since been closed off to us. The government now publishes the claimant count in conjunction with an internationally-agreed measure of unemployment that is less susceptible to official massaging (and which shows the jobless total to be around 50% higher). But for those who still feel a twinge of nostalgia for the good old days, Gordon Brown arranged a stroll down memory lane last week. According to the treasury, there are jobs for all in the humming British economy, with as many unfilled vacancies as there are unemployed looking for work. Moreover, there is little variation between one region and another. And how has the chancellor come to this conclusion which, on the face of it, suggests that not only has Labour cracked unemployment but has eliminated the north-south divide, to boot? </p> <p>Why, through our old friend the claimant count. What the treasury has done is take the number of people out of work and claiming benefit - around 1.15m - and treated that as an accurate measure of unemployment. Then it arrives at a similar number of vacancies by taking the number of jobs officially notified to Jobcentres (340,000) and multiplying by three on the assumption that the authorities only get to know about a third of all the positions actually available. </p> <p><strong>No hiding place</strong></p> <p> So there we have it. In the modern Britain, there is no excuse for the able bodied to be idle and there should be no hiding place for the workshy. \"I say to the unemployed who can work - you must now meet your responsibility to earn a wage,\" Brown said last week. The chancellor needs to be careful with this sort of stuff. Very careful indeed. He is as passionate as anybody about reducing unemployment and breaking the cycle of joblessness and poverty. As the budget later this month will show, he is forever thinking up new ways of helping people to find work. He is no Norman Tebbit, but one of the jokes doing the rounds last week was: \"What's the difference between Tebbit and Brown? If you're poor enough, Gordon will buy the bike for you.\" </p> <p> From the TUC, there was an instant and well-justified slap on the wrists \"The real figure shows that there are four people who want a job for every vacancy\", said John Monks, the TUC general secretary. \"No one much trusted the claimant count unemployment figures under the last government, it would be a mistake to start believing them now.\" </p> <p> Monks is right. A prolonged period of economic growth means that there has been an impressive fall in the claimant count - from a peak of almost 3m - over the past seven years. But the official figures fail to capture the whole picture, in particular those people who have dropped out of the labour market completely. Here, the figures vary considerably from one part of the country to another. </p> <p> For example, 28% of men over 50 - around 1.3m people - are now classified as economically inactive, which means that they don't show up in any unemployment figures. In 1975 the figure was 7%. In addition, around 8% of non-student men under 50 - another 1m people - are outside the labour market, against 1% in 1975. In Britain's unemployment blackspots, the social housing estates, 30% of men are inactive and only 54% are in work. </p> <p> According to the government's own labour force survey there are now some 2.3m men of working age, excluding students, who are economically inactive. This is twice the number of unemployed as measured by the claimant count and almost six times the number of men outside the labour market 20 years ago. Is this because these men are inherently lazy? If that is the case, there would be little doubt that the government's carrot and stick - a mobile phone to keep in touch with the Jobcentre, an earnings top up plus the threat of loss of benefit for the workshy would be justified. But there are two important questions here. Are the jobs on offer, even with the relatively generous working families tax credit - paying enough? Most of the jobs on offer in the high-unemployment areas tend to be minimum-wage occupations in industries such as catering and care. </p> <p>All the evidence shows that while people are prepared to commute vast distances for well-paid jobs in the City, they are not prepared to fork out \u00a310-15 a week for jobs paying \u00a33.60 an hour. Or as one labour-market expert put it: \"People don't travel long distances for crap jobs.\" The second point is whether there really are jobs everywhere. The answer is no, as even the government's own paper admits when it says there are real problems in the run-down seaside towns, the mining villages and some urban conurbations. The workless rates for prime-aged men on Merseyside, for example, are horrific. </p> <p> If the claimant count is under-estimating the number of people really out of work, then the government's vacancy numbers also look dubious. A study by the Greater Manchester Low Pay Unit has suggested that both the regional and national vacancy data are far from accurate, finding little correlation between the number of vacancies on display and the official vacancy data for particular Jobcentres. Since last summer, the office for national statistics has stopped publishing individual Jobcentre vacancy statistics because of the unreliability of the data, but as the GMLPU says: \"If individual Jobcentre figures are unreliable, then the overall figure of which these are components, must also be unreliable.\" </p> <p> In addition, the TUC argues that the Employment Service is now more efficient and better at capturing job vacancies in parts of the country. For example, the number of official vacancies in the north-east rose by 104% in the year to December 1999, compared to 19% in the south-west and a fall of 4% in the north west. In other words, the real situation on the ground is much less favourable than the government figures would suggest. </p> <p> The TUC says that there is a \"vast discrepancy in the employment rates of working age people, especially men, across the UK and it is clear that the decline in production and manufacturing industries in those regions outside southern England has been a key factor driving this trend.\" </p> <p> While welcoming government initiatives such as the new deal, the TUC said: \"We believe the overall success of welfare to work programmes, especially in those regions with below average employment rates, also depends on a demand side ensuring an adequate flow of jobs as well as a supply side of welfare and labour market reform. </p> <p> It is therefore imperative for those regions that the current nascent recovery in manufacturing is not prematurely arrested by a sustained overvaluation of sterling.\" </p> <p><strong> Part of the culture</strong><br> As the government knows, there was a huge shock to the labour market in the 80s. In some parts of the country, long-term unemployment has become part of the culture and is not simply a supply-side problem. In the south-east there are enough rich people to create spillover low-skilled service sector jobs; on Merseyside many of the high-earners have upped and left for other parts of the country. People can be retrained and given tips on interview techniques, but if there are no jobs for men in their 30s, 40s and 50s then there are no jobs </p> <p>This is an issue that governments have been grappling with for almost a century. There are really only two choices: move the people where the jobs are, or move the jobs where the people are. We've tried the former and it hasn't worked. The government should recognise that the real problem is not motivation or defective interview skills, but a lack of jobs that only a coherent mix of macro-economic, supply-side and regional policies can address. Using dodgy figures to cover up the true picture is not helpful.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We all love a good moan, and for those on the left there were few better subjects to moan about in the 80s and 90s than the unemployment figures. Month after month Labour raged at the way the Conservatives lopped people off the dole queue by moving the goalposts. Fiddle, they said, as the claimant count was reduced by making groups ineligible for benefit. Insult to the real unemployed, they claimed, as the out of work were re-classified as long-term sick. That particular avenue of enjoyment has since been closed off to us. The government now publishes the claimant count in conjunction with an internationally-agreed measure of unemployment that is less susceptible to official massaging (and which shows the jobless total to be around 50% higher). But for those who still feel a twinge of nostalgia for the good old days, Gordon Brown arranged a stroll down memory lane last week. According to the treasury, there are jobs for all in the humming British economy, with as many unfilled vacancies as there are unemployed looking for work. Moreover, there is little variation between one region and another. And how has the chancellor come to this conclusion which, on the face of it, suggests that not only has Labour cracked unemployment but has eliminated the north-south divide, to boot? Why, through our old friend the claimant count. What the treasury has done is take the number of people out of work and claiming benefit - around 1.15m - and treated that as an accurate measure of unemployment. Then it arrives at a similar number of vacancies by taking the number of jobs officially notified to Jobcentres (340,000) and multiplying by three on the assumption that the authorities only get to know about a third of all the positions actually available. No hiding place So there we have it. In the modern Britain, there is no excuse for the able bodied to be idle and there should be no hiding place for the workshy. \"I say to the unemployed who can work - you must now meet your responsibility to earn a wage,\" Brown said last week. The chancellor needs to be careful with this sort of stuff. Very careful indeed. He is as passionate as anybody about reducing unemployment and breaking the cycle of joblessness and poverty. As the budget later this month will show, he is forever thinking up new ways of helping people to find work. He is no Norman Tebbit, but one of the jokes doing the rounds last week was: \"What's the difference between Tebbit and Brown? If you're poor enough, Gordon will buy the bike for you.\" From the TUC, there was an instant and well-justified slap on the wrists \"The real figure shows that there are four people who want a job for every vacancy\", said John Monks, the TUC general secretary. \"No one much trusted the claimant count unemployment figures under the last government, it would be a mistake to start believing them now.\" Monks is right. A prolonged period of economic growth means that there has been an impressive fall in the claimant count - from a peak of almost 3m - over the past seven years. But the official figures fail to capture the whole picture, in particular those people who have dropped out of the labour market completely. Here, the figures vary considerably from one part of the country to another. For example, 28% of men over 50 - around 1.3m people - are now classified as economically inactive, which means that they don't show up in any unemployment figures. In 1975 the figure was 7%. In addition, around 8% of non-student men under 50 - another 1m people - are outside the labour market, against 1% in 1975. In Britain's unemployment blackspots, the social housing estates, 30% of men are inactive and only 54% are in work. According to the government's own labour force survey there are now some 2.3m men of working age, excluding students, who are economically inactive. This is twice the number of unemployed as measured by the claimant count and almost six times the number of men outside the labour market 20 years ago. Is this because these men are inherently lazy? If that is the case, there would be little doubt that the government's carrot and stick - a mobile phone to keep in touch with the Jobcentre, an earnings top up plus the threat of loss of benefit for the workshy would be justified. But there are two important questions here. Are the jobs on offer, even with the relatively generous working families tax credit - paying enough? Most of the jobs on offer in the high-unemployment areas tend to be minimum-wage occupations in industries such as catering and care. All the evidence shows that while people are prepared to commute vast distances for well-paid jobs in the City, they are not prepared to fork out \u00a310-15 a week for jobs paying \u00a33.60 an hour. Or as one labour-market expert put it: \"People don't travel long distances for crap jobs.\" The second point is whether there really are jobs everywhere. The answer is no, as even the government's own paper admits when it says there are real problems in the run-down seaside towns, the mining villages and some urban conurbations. The workless rates for prime-aged men on Merseyside, for example, are horrific. If the claimant count is under-estimating the number of people really out of work, then the government's vacancy numbers also look dubious. A study by the Greater Manchester Low Pay Unit has suggested that both the regional and national vacancy data are far from accurate, finding little correlation between the number of vacancies on display and the official vacancy data for particular Jobcentres. Since last summer, the office for national statistics has stopped publishing individual Jobcentre vacancy statistics because of the unreliability of the data, but as the GMLPU says: \"If individual Jobcentre figures are unreliable, then the overall figure of which these are components, must also be unreliable.\" In addition, the TUC argues that the Employment Service is now more efficient and better at capturing job vacancies in parts of the country. For example, the number of official vacancies in the north-east rose by 104% in the year to December 1999, compared to 19% in the south-west and a fall of 4% in the north west. In other words, the real situation on the ground is much less favourable than the government figures would suggest. The TUC says that there is a \"vast discrepancy in the employment rates of working age people, especially men, across the UK and it is clear that the decline in production and manufacturing industries in those regions outside southern England has been a key factor driving this trend.\" While welcoming government initiatives such as the new deal, the TUC said: \"We believe the overall success of welfare to work programmes, especially in those regions with below average employment rates, also depends on a demand side ensuring an adequate flow of jobs as well as a supply side of welfare and labour market reform. It is therefore imperative for those regions that the current nascent recovery in manufacturing is not prematurely arrested by a sustained overvaluation of sterling.\" Part of the culture As the government knows, there was a huge shock to the labour market in the 80s. In some parts of the country, long-term unemployment has become part of the culture and is not simply a supply-side problem. In the south-east there are enough rich people to create spillover low-skilled service sector jobs; on Merseyside many of the high-earners have upped and left for other parts of the country. People can be retrained and given tips on interview techniques, but if there are no jobs for men in their 30s, 40s and 50s then there are no jobs This is an issue that governments have been grappling with for almost a century. There are really only two choices: move the people where the jobs are, or move the jobs where the people are. We've tried the former and it hasn't worked. The government should recognise that the real problem is not motivation or defective interview skills, but a lack of jobs that only a coherent mix of macro-economic, supply-side and regional policies can address. Using dodgy figures to cover up the true picture is not helpful.",

The Labour party announced the result of our mayoral selection on February 20. We elected Frank Dobson as our candidate and he will fight the election for us on May 4. I am sorry if Ken Livingstone has not understood this but I have explained it to him. However, there is no reason why you should continue to suggest anything other than that as the position is clear-cut. Margaret McDonagh General secretary, Labour party \u0095 When I was a member of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities policy committee 20 years ago, Ken Livingstone was known in the Labour group not as Red Ken, but as Corkscrew Ken. Interesting to see that he still displays the inability to come to a decision. Clive Wilkinson Birmingham \u0095 In 1964 Patrick Gordon-Walker, Harold Wilson's designated foreign secretary, had to be provided with a safe Labour seat. Leyton, with a majority of over 20,000, was selected, and Joe Sorensen, the long-standing MP, was elevated to the peerage. The electors of Leyton for the first time returned a Tory. What was demonstrated was that Londoners will not be dictated to. The good people of Wales have recently demonstrated that they will not be dictated to either. If New Labour (what a horrible term - why doesn't Blair just admit that it is the old Social Democratic party of the infamous Gang of Four?) persist with Frank Dobson, then the people of London will do exactly what the voters of Leyton did in 1964.

The majority of Israelis favour a withdrawal from Lebanon, and the July deadline has made them even more impatient to be rid of a guerrilla war that is already lost. Last month saw the heaviest Israeli casualties in years, and with Hizbullah guerrillas picking off soldiers in their bunkers with anti-tank missiles, even the troops began to publicly question their mission. One soldier was jailed for refusing to return to active duty in the nine-mile security zone, and Israel's generals were so worried about troop morale that they dispatched counsellors to frontline outposts. \"Every day we are stuck there is needless, and everybody knows that,\" said the novelist, David Grossman, who has been a vocal opponent of the war. \"What is the point of having an alleged atomic reactor and an atomic bomb if we are stuck in the same situation.

It might also encourage Syria - the real power in the country - to prevail on Hizbullah guerrillas to harry the departing forces and to strike across the border at civilians. With time running out before Mr Barak's self-imposed deadline, that scenario is beginning to take on a more concrete shape, with the prime minister admitting recently that \"people will die on both sides of the border\" in the months following a unilateral withdrawal. But the eventual outcome will depend on Syria, and it was unclear last night what effect the cabinet decision will have on thinking in Damascus. Talks with Syria broke off in January over demands that Israel commit to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which it has occupied since the 1967 war. There have been strong suggestions in recent days - and coy denials from Mr Barak's office - that the two sides are being coaxed towards an understanding in secret through the personal intervention of the US president, Bill Clinton. But Mr Barak is racing against time.

After that he was supposed to be allowed to take his son to McDonald's on a Saturday, but the boy and his mother didn't show up.</p> <p>The problem for the 35-year-old accountant isn't convincing the court to allow him to see his son. He has a pile of court orders granting him contact. But how can you make court orders stick if a mother is determined that the father should play no part in the child's life? Last Friday he was in court for the 34th time, asking the judge to take action to enforce the orders. He came away empty-handed.</p> <p>Beale and the boy's mother weren't married or even living together when she discovered she was pregnant. \"The relationship didn't work but I decided I wanted to be a proper father to my son,\" he explains. His name was put on the birth certificate as the father. He wanted to see his son regularly and take him for days out and holidays, but from the beginning his ex-girlfriend was unhappy with the idea.</p> <p>Beale went to court and first won the right to contact when his son was six months old.

      "bodyText": "John Beale has seen his five-year-old son only three times since May 1998. The last time was five months ago at a contact centre, neutral ground on the warring parents' battlefield. After that he was supposed to be allowed to take his son to McDonald's on a Saturday, but the boy and his mother didn't show up. The problem for the 35-year-old accountant isn't convincing the court to allow him to see his son. He has a pile of court orders granting him contact. But how can you make court orders stick if a mother is determined that the father should play no part in the child's life? Last Friday he was in court for the 34th time, asking the judge to take action to enforce the orders. He came away empty-handed. Beale and the boy's mother weren't married or even living together when she discovered she was pregnant. \"The relationship didn't work but I decided I wanted to be a proper father to my son,\" he explains. His name was put on the birth certificate as the father. He wanted to see his son regularly and take him for days out and holidays, but from the beginning his ex-girlfriend was unhappy with the idea. Beale went to court and first won the right to contact when his son was six months old. But each time an order was made, he says, it was complied with only for a short time before he had to seek the court's help again. \"Very close friends couldn't believe this could happen. My anger is not with the mother - she can't anger me any more.

His chief rival, George W Bush, who plans to free all drug offenders if elected, has a new strategy to woo Latino voters: he is doubling his normal tip in Mexican restaurants.</p> <p>As the campaign for the Republican and Democrat nominations reaches its likely climax in California and New York tomorrow, the satirical rumour mills have been grinding even more energetically.</p> <p>It is not surprising that the notion of Mr McCain as a brainwashed tool of the communists should have a certain frisson. John Frankenheimer's 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate explored the idea of an American hero of the Korean war who had been programmed by the communists to return to the US and kill a politician. Starring Lawrence Harvey, Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh, the film caused waves at a time when the US was recovering from its McCarthyite anti-communist witch-hunts. The wicked rumour that Mr McCain, a prisoner of the Vietnamese for five and a half years, was the new \"Manchurian candidate\" has been given its biggest airing by his own supporters, who have publicised it as an example of how dastardly some opponents can be in spreading such obvious nonsense.</p> <p>Mr Bush was an early victim of the dirty rumour mills. A website, gwbush.com, which purported to be his, claimed that in his first year in office he would empty the jails of the country's 400,000 drug offenders. Citing the fact that one in nine children in the US has a parent in jail, he was said on the site to want to become \"the president who gave those kids their parents back\".</p> <p>\"Recreational drug users - like I used to be - are serving life sentences because dealer friends made up stories to get a lighter sentence,\" says \"Mr Bush\" on the bogus website. \"If this were happening in China, we'd probably start bombing them for human rights violations. We have to let these people go.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush's attempts to win the Latino vote prompted The Onion, a Wisconsin-based satirical newspaper and website, to run the story: \"Bush reaches out to Hispanic community with generous tip.\"</p> <p>The Onion records that \"Bush extended the hand of friendship to the nation's Hispanic community by leaving a larger-than-customary tip for waiter Ramon Gonzalez after eating at La Galeria, a trendy Chula Vista bistro\". The Onion, which has 1m readers, suggested that Mr Bush's \"$20 gratuity on a bill of $83.42, working out at 24%, is the largest tip the Hispanic community has ever received from a Republican presidential candidate\". Mr Bush was quoted as saying: \"It is my way of acknowledging the many valuable things Hispanics bring to the table - from appetisers to drinks to main courses.\"</p> <p>The Republican frontrunner was also mocked after a rally in Michigan last week, when a Canadian television reporter told Mr Bush that he had won the endorsement of the Canadian prime minister, Jean Poutine. Mr Bush was flattered and told the reporter: \"I'm honoured... He understands that I want to ensure our relationship with our most important neighbour to the north of us, Canadians, is strong. We will work closely together.\"</p> <p>Alas for Mr Bush, the real Canadian prime minister is Jean Chr\u00e9tien - while Poutine is a high-calorie, fast-food French-Canadian dish of chips covered in gravy and cheese curd. The \"journalist\" was the Canadian comedian Rick Mercer who operates in a similar way to Britain's Ali G and often pokes fun at Americans' ignorance of Canada. Mr Bush's gaffe was gleefully transmitted in Canada last week. He was targeted after he failed to identify the leaders of India and Pakistan in interviews.</p> <p>But if Mr Bush continues to run, comedians may be redundant anyway. He is, after all, the \"compassionate conservative\" who last week gave the go-ahead to execute a great-grandmother in Texas.</p> <p>As satirist Tom Lehrer said when Henry Kissinger won the Nobel peace prize: \"Who needs satire?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Vietnamese government is quietly celebrating the fact that John McCain, the \"Manchurian candidate\" they brainwashed and programmed to seize power in the United States is only a few steps away from their goal. His chief rival, George W Bush, who plans to free all drug offenders if elected, has a new strategy to woo Latino voters: he is doubling his normal tip in Mexican restaurants. As the campaign for the Republican and Democrat nominations reaches its likely climax in California and New York tomorrow, the satirical rumour mills have been grinding even more energetically. It is not surprising that the notion of Mr McCain as a brainwashed tool of the communists should have a certain frisson. John Frankenheimer's 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate explored the idea of an American hero of the Korean war who had been programmed by the communists to return to the US and kill a politician. Starring Lawrence Harvey, Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh, the film caused waves at a time when the US was recovering from its McCarthyite anti-communist witch-hunts. The wicked rumour that Mr McCain, a prisoner of the Vietnamese for five and a half years, was the new \"Manchurian candidate\" has been given its biggest airing by his own supporters, who have publicised it as an example of how dastardly some opponents can be in spreading such obvious nonsense. Mr Bush was an early victim of the dirty rumour mills. A website, gwbush.com, which purported to be his, claimed that in his first year in office he would empty the jails of the country's 400,000 drug offenders. Citing the fact that one in nine children in the US has a parent in jail, he was said on the site to want to become \"the president who gave those kids their parents back\". \"Recreational drug users - like I used to be - are serving life sentences because dealer friends made up stories to get a lighter sentence,\" says \"Mr Bush\" on the bogus website. \"If this were happening in China, we'd probably start bombing them for human rights violations. We have to let these people go.\" Mr Bush's attempts to win the Latino vote prompted The Onion, a Wisconsin-based satirical newspaper and website, to run the story: \"Bush reaches out to Hispanic community with generous tip.\" The Onion records that \"Bush extended the hand of friendship to the nation's Hispanic community by leaving a larger-than-customary tip for waiter Ramon Gonzalez after eating at La Galeria, a trendy Chula Vista bistro\". The Onion, which has 1m readers, suggested that Mr Bush's \"$20 gratuity on a bill of $83.42, working out at 24%, is the largest tip the Hispanic community has ever received from a Republican presidential candidate\". Mr Bush was quoted as saying: \"It is my way of acknowledging the many valuable things Hispanics bring to the table - from appetisers to drinks to main courses.\" The Republican frontrunner was also mocked after a rally in Michigan last week, when a Canadian television reporter told Mr Bush that he had won the endorsement of the Canadian prime minister, Jean Poutine. Mr Bush was flattered and told the reporter: \"I'm honoured... He understands that I want to ensure our relationship with our most important neighbour to the north of us, Canadians, is strong. We will work closely together.\" Alas for Mr Bush, the real Canadian prime minister is Jean Chr\u00e9tien - while Poutine is a high-calorie, fast-food French-Canadian dish of chips covered in gravy and cheese curd. The \"journalist\" was the Canadian comedian Rick Mercer who operates in a similar way to Britain's Ali G and often pokes fun at Americans' ignorance of Canada. Mr Bush's gaffe was gleefully transmitted in Canada last week. He was targeted after he failed to identify the leaders of India and Pakistan in interviews. But if Mr Bush continues to run, comedians may be redundant anyway. He is, after all, the \"compassionate conservative\" who last week gave the go-ahead to execute a great-grandmother in Texas. As satirist Tom Lehrer said when Henry Kissinger won the Nobel peace prize: \"Who needs satire?\"",

One in five first time pregnancies were unplanned, but 81% of women said they were happy to be expecting. Some 87% of pregnant women admitted they were frightened of giving birth and 48% said they would be disappointed if they could not have a natural labour. The survey also found that most parents-to-be did not change their lifestyles before conceiving and were unprepared financially for the arrival of their baby. But once they discover they are pregnant, 57% of women give up drinking and 26% cut down. Half of couples (one or both) smoke before conception. While 50% of women give up, one-in-five continue to smoke an average of nine cigarettes a day. Some 88% of prospective parents acknowledged a baby would change their life, but only 42% had made any long-term savings plans, said Valery McConnell, editor of Pregnancy and Birth magazine. \"Babies need smoke free zones. Smoking in pregnancy means you're three times more likely to have a low-birthweight baby,\" she said.",

Although young people are more likely than ever before to be offered illegal drugs, they are less likely to start experimenting with them, the unit found. Its director, John Balding, has tracked the behaviour and attitudes of this age group since 1987 when less than 5% admitted to having tried an illegal drug at least once. By 1996 the proportion had risen to 33%, fuelling anxieties among parents and politicians that there was an unstoppable drugs epidemic. But over the following two years the numbers steadied and last year the proportion fell to 21% for both boys and girls. Although the unit is cautious of interpreting a trend from a single year's figures, it concluded: \"We are confident there has indeed been a levelling off and possibly even a downturn in this age group's experience of drugs.\" There was a similar reduction in the proportion of drug-taking by 12- to 13-year-olds, with 5% of boys and 4% of girls saying they had taken an illegal drug at least once. Mr Balding said the figures were \"tremendous good news\", suggesting that publicity around cases such as Leah Betts who died after taking ecstasy and the appointment of a drugs tsar might be reasons for the change. The unit's findings are based on questionnaires completed each year by about 40,000 pupils aged 9 to 15. In 1999 more than 40% of 14- to 15-year-olds said they had been offered drugs, usually cannabis. Although this was higher than before, the researchers think this may be the result of changes in the questions asked. About 8% said that at some point in their lives they used cannabis regularly and just over 1% said the same about amphetamines and solvents. When young people were asked if they knew where to obtain different illegal drugs, 18% of 12- to 13-year-olds and 39% of 14- to 15-year-olds said they knew where to get at least one. The figures suggest that more young people are refusing drugs in spite of their availability. Only 3% of non-users aged 14- to 15 said they would start using cannabis if it were made legal. Mr Balding said: \"It is trendy not to take drugs. Fashions change quite quickly. You get one reported accident ... and this has an effect.\" The downward trend coincided with investment in a network of drug action teams. \"If there is a connection, then well done.\" The report showed 35% of 14- to 15-year-olds thought cannabis was always unsafe. This compares with 70% for cocaine, 78% for ecstasy and 68% for solvents.",

      "body": "<p>A new row threatens to stir up the once-notorious two cultures debate and set science chiefs against an arts-loving government minister. The problem stems from the government's policy of free access to national museums.</p> <p>While art lovers who had expected to pay to see the new \u00a3135m Tate Modern on London's Bankside will enter free of charge from May 12, people queueing at the Science Museum in South Kensington for the opening of its new \u00a350m Wellcome wing in June could find admission prices increased.</p> <p>Last month culture secretary Chris Smith announced an extra \u00a35m for the Tate to ensure free entry. But it looks very unlikely that he will announce a similar sum for the Science Museum, despite the museum's initial expectation that they would get \u00a35m to fulfil the government's post-election pledge of free entry.</p> <p>The trustees of the South Kensington museum have refused to authorise the museum's latest budget, which called for raised entry prices and cuts in the repairs to interactive exhibits, and other damaging steps. They see the department of culture, media and sport as favouring the arts above science.</p> <p>Dame Bridget Ogilvie, head of the royal society's committee for the public understanding of science, and one of the trustees, said: \"Things are very serious. We begin to ask the question: is the arts mafia - which is very strong in terms of the chattering classes - getting the ear of our political masters rather more effectively than the scientists?\"</p> <p>Sir Neil Cossons, director of the Science Museum for the past 14 years, said both institutions had been required to put forward business plans before they could get the government nod for their new showplaces. Both expected to generate extra revenue by charging.</p> <p>The only difference was that the Tate had always been free, whereas the Science Museum, like the Natural History Museum next door, had installed turnstiles as the Tory government cut museum funding.</p> <p>Then came Labour's landslide victory, and a declaration by Mr Smith that museums and galleries were to return to the people. The science and natural history museums began letting children in free last April. Pensioners will be admitted free from this April. According to the government's plan all the great museums would be free from April next year.</p> <p>But not, it now seems, for the South Kensington museums. Instead of scrapping the \u00a36.95 adult charge, the Science Museum will have to increase the admission price to \u00a38.50 to keep the museum running.</p> <p>The science and natural history museums and the Tate all have Victorian origins, and all have millions of visitors each year.</p> <p>Sir Neil said: \"I would rather run a museum that charged and was good than one that was on principle free, and lousy. The difficulty is the art museums are not lousy. They are absolutely first class and they have traditionally been free and their supporters have enabled them to stay free.\"</p> <p>He saw dangers of polarisation between the arts and sciences, an issue raised by the scientist and novelist CP Snow four decades ago. \"It's a serious issue and it has been brought into sharp focus by the peculiarities of next year and the year after. The public who enjoy places like this are being told they are second rate citizens: if you want to enjoy science, you pay.</p> <p>\"I'm surprised because here we are still fighting the crazy battles of half a century, a century, and a century and a half ago. Of course there has to be access to art. But science has to thrive, and it has to thrive in terms of popular access, at a time when there is more interest than there has ever been - and astonishing and challenging new developments are taking place which will touch every man, woman and child in the country.\"</p> <p>When the Wellcome wing was first announced five years ago it was described as a showcase for science that had yet to be invented. It will open with exhibitions devoted to the questions raised by the revolution in information technology and communications and in the new science of human genetics.</p> <p>But the museum itself is devoted to the growth of British science from the 17th century to the present, including the industrial revolution that changed the world.</p> <p>Both the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum were forced to impose charges to maintain standards. Both have had to make huge cuts and at the same time attract extra visitors. The argument in South Kensington is that there is no fat left to cut.</p> <p>The director of the Natural History Museum, Neil Chalmers, hopes for generosity from Mr Smith when the the first phase of a \u00a3100m Darwin centre opens in 2002.</p> <p>The department of culture said its priority was to see that museums that were already free remained free.</p> <p>\"We are not quite clear on what we are going to be doing for anyone.\"</p> <p>But the Science Museum was not excluded because of its subject matter.</p> <p><b>Contrasting exhibitions</b></p> <p><b> Science Museum Wellcome wing </b></p> <p>Opening : June 27<br> Funding: Project cost \u00a350m.

While art lovers who had expected to pay to see the new \u00a3135m Tate Modern on London's Bankside will enter free of charge from May 12, people queueing at the Science Museum in South Kensington for the opening of its new \u00a350m Wellcome wing in June could find admission prices increased. Last month culture secretary Chris Smith announced an extra \u00a35m for the Tate to ensure free entry. But it looks very unlikely that he will announce a similar sum for the Science Museum, despite the museum's initial expectation that they would get \u00a35m to fulfil the government's post-election pledge of free entry. The trustees of the South Kensington museum have refused to authorise the museum's latest budget, which called for raised entry prices and cuts in the repairs to interactive exhibits, and other damaging steps. They see the department of culture, media and sport as favouring the arts above science. Dame Bridget Ogilvie, head of the royal society's committee for the public understanding of science, and one of the trustees, said: \"Things are very serious. We begin to ask the question: is the arts mafia - which is very strong in terms of the chattering classes - getting the ear of our political masters rather more effectively than the scientists?\" Sir Neil Cossons, director of the Science Museum for the past 14 years, said both institutions had been required to put forward business plans before they could get the government nod for their new showplaces. Both expected to generate extra revenue by charging. The only difference was that the Tate had always been free, whereas the Science Museum, like the Natural History Museum next door, had installed turnstiles as the Tory government cut museum funding. Then came Labour's landslide victory, and a declaration by Mr Smith that museums and galleries were to return to the people. The science and natural history museums began letting children in free last April. Pensioners will be admitted free from this April. According to the government's plan all the great museums would be free from April next year. But not, it now seems, for the South Kensington museums. Instead of scrapping the \u00a36.95 adult charge, the Science Museum will have to increase the admission price to \u00a38.50 to keep the museum running. The science and natural history museums and the Tate all have Victorian origins, and all have millions of visitors each year. Sir Neil said: \"I would rather run a museum that charged and was good than one that was on principle free, and lousy. The difficulty is the art museums are not lousy. They are absolutely first class and they have traditionally been free and their supporters have enabled them to stay free.\" He saw dangers of polarisation between the arts and sciences, an issue raised by the scientist and novelist CP Snow four decades ago. \"It's a serious issue and it has been brought into sharp focus by the peculiarities of next year and the year after. The public who enjoy places like this are being told they are second rate citizens: if you want to enjoy science, you pay. \"I'm surprised because here we are still fighting the crazy battles of half a century, a century, and a century and a half ago. Of course there has to be access to art. But science has to thrive, and it has to thrive in terms of popular access, at a time when there is more interest than there has ever been - and astonishing and challenging new developments are taking place which will touch every man, woman and child in the country.\" When the Wellcome wing was first announced five years ago it was described as a showcase for science that had yet to be invented. It will open with exhibitions devoted to the questions raised by the revolution in information technology and communications and in the new science of human genetics. But the museum itself is devoted to the growth of British science from the 17th century to the present, including the industrial revolution that changed the world. Both the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum were forced to impose charges to maintain standards. Both have had to make huge cuts and at the same time attract extra visitors. The argument in South Kensington is that there is no fat left to cut. The director of the Natural History Museum, Neil Chalmers, hopes for generosity from Mr Smith when the the first phase of a \u00a3100m Darwin centre opens in 2002. The department of culture said its priority was to see that museums that were already free remained free. \"We are not quite clear on what we are going to be doing for anyone.\" But the Science Museum was not excluded because of its subject matter. Contrasting exhibitions Science Museum Wellcome wing Opening : June 27 Funding: Project cost \u00a350m.

Given a halfway decent daily, two elderly ladies should have been discovered starving to death in the west wing sooner rather than later. Of course, good help is hard to keep with cats, owls and actors all over the place. Dorothy Parker's maid, encountering an alligator in the bath, left a stiff note. \"I cannot work in a house where there are alligators. I would have told you this before but I didn't suppose the question would ever come up.\" It came up in spades at Gormenghast. </p> <p>The mansion to which Charles Fairfield eloped with off-the-shoulder Alice, his virginal bride, in The Wyvern Mystery (BBC 1) was just such a cavernous warren. His father, the wicked squire (Derek Jacobi wearing a sort of thatch) called it \"that rundown piece of misery\". Just the place to stash a forceful French first wife with a bad skin condition. There was a housekeeper, but very much in the boot-faced Manderley mould, given to veiled hints about family scandals. Georgian gentry evidently had as much elbow room in their lives as in their houses. </p> <p>There is a great deal of galloping about in all directions, particularly by the thatched squire (\"You'll not marry her, if I have to hunt you both down like animals! Aye, run, run!\") which gives no-one time to stop and ask, like Arthur Daley, \"What is occurring, Terence?\". What seems to be occurring is that the forceful French wife is suffering from some disfiguring disease I can't quite put my finger on and, in any case, I'd much rather not. Blind, malign and trailing black bombazine, she haunts Alice's dreams and, in the well-worth-waiting-for last minutes of the first episode, crashes though her bedroom wall, like a secret, black and midnight missile. You cannot but feel that Aisling O'Sullivan, moulting magnificently like a sick eagle, is having a high old time. I don't know Sheridan Le Fanu - not to speak to, that is - which makes the whole thing much jollier and less predictable. </p> <p>Those, beside snakes, who enjoy the sensation of their skin crawling can indulge themselves in Bloodlines (BBC 2). A chartered surveyor from Bognor - and they don't come much more staid than that - has spent 17 obsessive years investigating his great-great-great-grandfather, the public hangman William Calcroft, and expects to spend 17 more \"putting flesh on the skeleton\", as he phrased it - for he is not overburdened with humour. </p> <p>And meanwhile, back in Coronation Street (ITV), Ken Barlow, who is writing a local history (\"The truth is out there, Deirdre!\"), has dug up, so to speak, the fact that Fred Elliott's grandfather was hung for murder. As Fred is a butcher, this could reflect adversely on the sale of Elliott's prime pork pies (\"You won't get better! Ah say, you won't get better!\"). People are so... well, they are, aren't they? </p> <p>It seems to have escaped the locals' attention that Coronation Street is cobbled with the stiffening corpses of the slaughtered. There was, let's think, Emily's husband gunned down in a robbery... Gail's stabbed outside a nightclub... Natalie's killed in a brawl with drug dealers... Deirdre's knifed beside the sour canal... and Rita's flattened by a tram while chasing her across Blackpool Prom with fell intent and a loaded firearm. If Ken called his book The Curse Of Coronation Street, he could make a killing. Run coach trips. Sell black armbands. Lay on a pork pie buffet. </p> <p>If you can't afford the best barrister to represent you, then at least make sure you get the best actor to play you - for that is how the world will remember you. Justice In Wonderland (BBC2) </p> <p>was a dramatised version of the Neil Hamilton vs Al Fayed libel trial, punctuated with \"whoomphs!\" like a racing car as it accelerated past the less gripping bits. All the protagonists should be pleased with their sympathetic portrayal, particularly Charles Dance's Hamilton, emotion played almost entirely with the eyelids, and Kenneth Cranham's Carman QC, more fatal than in the flesh. </p> <p>It felt as ruthless and relentless as Calcroft's speciality, a public hanging.

Conservative peers, many of whom look more at home in the age of Gladstone than Bill Gates, are soon to launch their own website, provisionally titled ermine.com. The 232 Tories in the upper house, who are still wounded from the abolition of the hereditaries late last year, are hoping the new site will allow them to make public their efforts to discomfort the government. Net users will be able to find biographical information and pictures of Conservative peers, together with the latest news on the party's stance on controversial elements of legislation. There will even be scope for \"e-lobbying\", by which the public can register support for individual causes and suggest topics on which the peers may campaign. The development, to be launched this spring, will also mean every Tory peer will have access to email, which party chiefs will use to inform members which way to vote. \"This is the start of virtual whipping,\" said one source close to the project. Senior Tories in the Lords, who held a meeting last week with a \"teenage whizzkid\" charged with designing the site, dismiss suggestions that many of their peers do not know a website from a woolsack. Lord Strathclyde, Conservative leader in the Lords, said: \"Around 70% of our members already use new technology because in the Lords, where we have far less money for office costs than the Commons, computers are the most efficient way of getting things done.\" Though accepting that the party may have to find a zappier domain name (grousemoor.com has been ruled out), he claimed: \"There is a thirst for knowledge on what is happening in the Lords. People will want to know what we are up to.\" The Tory peers' site will add to the growing political war in cyberspace. Last month, Tony Blair - a self-confessed new technology novice - launched a No 10 website, on which he makes weekly \"webcasts\". The main parties are also in creasingly making use of internet technology to recruit and inform members and activists, saving money on leaflet printing and postage. The prime purpose of ermine.com will be to needle the government, and particularly the leader of the Lords, Baroness Jay, over the continuing power of the second chamber to challenge government policy. Ministers have found it harder to dismiss government defeats on issues such as restricted rights to jury trial after saying the upper house has greater legitimacy following the axeing of the hereditaries. The Conservatives will use a Lords debate tomorrow on future reform of the second chamber to press ministers to move swiftly to second-stage reform of the current \"interim house\".",

As well as being a pianist, harpsichordist and conductor, he was also a broadcaster, lecturer and administrator.</p> <p>Salter was a descendant of Solomon Sulzer, a composer friend of Beethoven and Schubert; his father was a language teacher and his mother worked for a small record company. He clearly inherited genes that shaped his astonishing career, which began as a child-prodigy pianist.</p> <p>The approaches of his first teachers, Stanley Chapple and Yorke Trotter (1923-31), were based on sight-reading and aural training, vital elements in the development of musicianship. At the age of 14 he won a piano, the junior prize in a competition organised by the Daily Express, and demonstrated his prodigious memory by winning another competition after reading the score for a mere 10 minutes.</p> <p>After a year at the Royal College of Music in London, Salter studied with Professor Edward Dent at St John's College, Cambridge (1932-5), where he graduated with first-class honours in music and modern languages. During that time he played some 100 concerts, acted as music critic for Granta, co-founded the university gramophone society, studied the harpsichord with Boris Ord, the piano with James Ching (a Bach specialist) and Arthur Benjamin, the viola and the organ with Arnold Goldsborough and orchestration with Gordon Jacob. Returning to the royal college for another year, he studied conducting with Malcolm Sargent and Constant Lambert.</p> <p>Salter then worked for London Films at Denham, editing Arthur Bliss's score for Things To Come, orchestrating, composing, acting as chorus master and playing what actors were miming on the screen. He also learned about camera techniques and film-cutting, and in 1936 was offered work in Hollywood. Unenthusiastic about the prospect and having heard that \"the wireless was going in for pictures\", he instead accepted the post of accompanist to the world's first TV station at the BBC, where he later became chorus master, r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur and general assistant.</p> <p>During the second world war, he worked in intelligence and education, screening those who returned from Dunkirk and teaching codes - while also playing and conducting. Seconded to Algiers in 1943, he was also chief guest conductor of the Radio France Symphony Orchestra, then in exile.</p> <p>Salter returned to the BBC in 1945 as assistant conductor of the BBC Theatre Orchestra. He played (unrehearsed) the piano part of Stravinsky's Petrushka, under Ernest Ansermet, and directed all the BBC vocal ensembles for a month before the Proms. In 1948, he became BBC European music supervisor, covering 42 language sections, personally contributed many talks (in English and French), interviews and features on diverse musical topics, and reviewed new records.</p> <p>Elsewhere on BBC territory he accompanied recitals for international artists, conducted the BBC Singers, and composed the music for two English-by-radio pantomimes of George Miles and several radio plays. He was the first person to play a fortepiano in the Royal Festival Hall, and accompanied Pablo Casals at his home in Prades, where, as co-editor with Roberto Gerhard for a 26-part series on Spanish music, he persuaded the cellist to record for the BBC.</p> <p>Salter remained with the corporation until 1974. His responsibilities covered a diverse range of posts from artists' manager, head of overseas music, opera producer for the BBC and the European Broadcasting Union, head of TV music (for which he laid down the \"grammar\" of camera technique), and assistant controller of music.</p> <p>He contributed articles to encyclopaedias (including Grove) and journals, translated the libretti of 126 operas and texts of countless lieder, prepared performing editions of baroque operas and instrumental works, worked as a conductor in TV and films, composed music for radio plays, and became familiar as a lecturer, broadcaster, and adjudicator in festivals across Britain and abroad.</p> <p>For many years, Salter was editor for the associated board of music, of the BBC Proms programmes and those of the Edinburgh Festival. His books, including Going To A Concert, Going To The Opera and The Young Musician And His World were bestsellers.

      "bodyText": "Lionel Salter, who has died aged 85, was an all-round musician who had a long association with the BBC; he became assistant controller of music and was perhaps best known to music lovers as a reviewer for 50 years for the magazine Gramophone. As well as being a pianist, harpsichordist and conductor, he was also a broadcaster, lecturer and administrator. Salter was a descendant of Solomon Sulzer, a composer friend of Beethoven and Schubert; his father was a language teacher and his mother worked for a small record company. He clearly inherited genes that shaped his astonishing career, which began as a child-prodigy pianist. The approaches of his first teachers, Stanley Chapple and Yorke Trotter (1923-31), were based on sight-reading and aural training, vital elements in the development of musicianship. At the age of 14 he won a piano, the junior prize in a competition organised by the Daily Express, and demonstrated his prodigious memory by winning another competition after reading the score for a mere 10 minutes. After a year at the Royal College of Music in London, Salter studied with Professor Edward Dent at St John's College, Cambridge (1932-5), where he graduated with first-class honours in music and modern languages. During that time he played some 100 concerts, acted as music critic for Granta, co-founded the university gramophone society, studied the harpsichord with Boris Ord, the piano with James Ching (a Bach specialist) and Arthur Benjamin, the viola and the organ with Arnold Goldsborough and orchestration with Gordon Jacob. Returning to the royal college for another year, he studied conducting with Malcolm Sargent and Constant Lambert. Salter then worked for London Films at Denham, editing Arthur Bliss's score for Things To Come, orchestrating, composing, acting as chorus master and playing what actors were miming on the screen. He also learned about camera techniques and film-cutting, and in 1936 was offered work in Hollywood. Unenthusiastic about the prospect and having heard that \"the wireless was going in for pictures\", he instead accepted the post of accompanist to the world's first TV station at the BBC, where he later became chorus master, r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur and general assistant. During the second world war, he worked in intelligence and education, screening those who returned from Dunkirk and teaching codes - while also playing and conducting. Seconded to Algiers in 1943, he was also chief guest conductor of the Radio France Symphony Orchestra, then in exile. Salter returned to the BBC in 1945 as assistant conductor of the BBC Theatre Orchestra. He played (unrehearsed) the piano part of Stravinsky's Petrushka, under Ernest Ansermet, and directed all the BBC vocal ensembles for a month before the Proms. In 1948, he became BBC European music supervisor, covering 42 language sections, personally contributed many talks (in English and French), interviews and features on diverse musical topics, and reviewed new records. Elsewhere on BBC territory he accompanied recitals for international artists, conducted the BBC Singers, and composed the music for two English-by-radio pantomimes of George Miles and several radio plays. He was the first person to play a fortepiano in the Royal Festival Hall, and accompanied Pablo Casals at his home in Prades, where, as co-editor with Roberto Gerhard for a 26-part series on Spanish music, he persuaded the cellist to record for the BBC. Salter remained with the corporation until 1974. His responsibilities covered a diverse range of posts from artists' manager, head of overseas music, opera producer for the BBC and the European Broadcasting Union, head of TV music (for which he laid down the \"grammar\" of camera technique), and assistant controller of music. He contributed articles to encyclopaedias (including Grove) and journals, translated the libretti of 126 operas and texts of countless lieder, prepared performing editions of baroque operas and instrumental works, worked as a conductor in TV and films, composed music for radio plays, and became familiar as a lecturer, broadcaster, and adjudicator in festivals across Britain and abroad. For many years, Salter was editor for the associated board of music, of the BBC Proms programmes and those of the Edinburgh Festival. His books, including Going To A Concert, Going To The Opera and The Young Musician And His World were bestsellers. He also wrote thousands of programme and liner notes for record companies. In an article in the book Gramophone: The First 75 Years, Salter wrote: \"The question of honesty looms large in many aspects of reviewing\". To this he might have added \"depth of knowledge and experience\", which lay at the roots of his own work. Deeply respected by colleagues and readers, he was generous to others, had liberal tastes in a wide range of the arts, and a gourmet appreciation of wines and other good things in life. Lionel Salter married Christine Fraser in 1948. She died in 1998 and he is survived by their three sons, Graham (a professional musician), Adrian and Brian.

Pink feathers flutter in a breeze over rotting carcasses lying half submerged in mud, splayed out on rocks or impaled on the thorns of bushes.</p> <p>A group of men and women, shrouded in the drifting steam that rises out of the hot springs on one side of the lake, dig shallow graves in the volcanic mud where they lay dead birds saved from the scavengers.</p> <p>A group of tourists looks on.

      "bodyText": "A putrid smell hovers over the shoreline of Lake Bogoria. Pink feathers flutter in a breeze over rotting carcasses lying half submerged in mud, splayed out on rocks or impaled on the thorns of bushes. A group of men and women, shrouded in the drifting steam that rises out of the hot springs on one side of the lake, dig shallow graves in the volcanic mud where they lay dead birds saved from the scavengers. A group of tourists looks on. A little girl turns to the man next to her and asks: \"Why are the flamingos dying?\" For the third time in seven years, tens of thousands of flamingos who inhabit the soda lakes of Kenya's Great Rift valley are dying of a disease believed to be caused by industrial pollution. \"We think there could be as many as 600 dying per day,\" said Moses Cheruiyot, a World Wide Fund for Nature researcher who has spent the last three years studying Lake Bogoria - home to more than a million flamingos. \"Nobody knows exactly what is causing this. But clinical studies suggest that industrial pollution is the probable cause.\" A conservative estimate puts the number of dead at 30,000 - but the real figure could be twice as high. What scientists do know is that the deaths began in July last year and set alarm bells ringing for conservationists who remember the flamingo crises of 1993 and 1995 when 50,000 birds died. They say that the latest outbreak could be the worst yet. The flamingos migrated to Lake Bogoria two years ago when unseasonable rains disturbed the delicate ecosystem of their preferred habitat of the nearby Lake Nakuru national park. That park was established with the specific purpose of saving the flamingo and was Africa's first bird sanctuary, boasting, until recently, millions of the colourful creatures. Now there are just a few thousand. A joint study by the WWF and Egerton university in Nairobi found significant traces of pollutants in Lake Nakuru which originated from industries based near the town. Until recently, waste was dumped into the lake and scientists have found high levels of mercury, chromium, copper, lead and even arsenic. Gideon Motelin, a professor at Egerton university, suspects that the pollutants in Lake Nakuru are the cause of the outbreak. \"Lake Nakuru is heavily contaminated, and although we can't be certain, there is a very strong feeling that pollution is the main cause of the deaths.\" Jackson Raini, a WWF programme officer, said that Nakuru's industries recently signed an agreement to preserve Lake Nakuru's ecosystem, but that years of toxic dumping in the area would take decades to correct. \"We have found traces of metals in the tissue of the birds who have died at Bogoria which match the metals we found in Nakuru.\" This has led the researchers to conclude that the birds carried the pollutants with them from Lake Nakuru and that some recent stress-catalyst has triggered the mass poisonings. \"There is a severe drought in the area and a shortage of fresh water on which the flamingos depend. It's very possible that the lack of fresh water is the stress catalyst that is causing the deaths.\" But David Harper, a biologist at the university of Leicester, who is leading a survey of Lake Bogoria, believes that this scenario is unlikely. \"We can't rule out the chemical pollutants as the cause but I believe that a bacterium is much more likely.\" \"The fact that the disease keeps reappearing shows that the problem is chronic,\" said Professor Motelin. \"For the long-term security of the species it's crucial that we get to the bottom of this.\"",

      "body": "<p>As the second hand on the station clock swept past midday, the guest of honour walked in. \"He's never late,\" whispered my neighbour. Unlike the trains. This was the official opening of a new railway station in Oslo: National Theatre. So naturally there were various cameos, including the inevitable snatch of Ibsen performed by actors from the building next door. Plus, this being Norway, there was a succession of over-long speeches. The minister spoke, then the head of the railways, then the mayor. Finally came the guest of honour.</p> <p>There was nothing in his demeanour or delivery (or, apparently, his content) that distinguished his speech from any of the others. He was a tall 62-year-old in a grey suit, with an egg-shaped head, bald apart from a less-than-fetching gingerish tonsure. He looked as though he might be the railway's deputy chief accountant, passed over for promotion, and longing for his pension.</p> <p>When the minister left, there was a flurry of cameramen because he was in the middle of a huge controversy involving the abortive merger of the Norwegian and Swedish telecom companies. When the guest of honour left, the media contingent did not stir, save for the crew making an official record for the railway. Thus ended another engagement for His Majesty King Harald V, master of the art of monarchy for the new millennium.</p> <p>To British eyes, the Norwegian royal family seems extraordinary: uncharismatic, low-key, slimline to the point of being cheapskate. It is not a bicycle monarchy because none of them rides a bicycle. It is, however, a railway monarchy. National Theatre station is just below the Slott, Oslo's very plain royal palace. In his speech, the king congratulated everyone on building such a handsome new station and then challenged them to improve the service (while behind him the indicator board recorded embarrassingly that the 11.58 to the airport was running 61 minutes late). This was not just an abstract line of oratory: the king regularly uses the airport express. The modern world has its worries even here so a phone call has to be made and a carriage cordoned off. Otherwise, he just comes down, usually with one detective and an aide-de-camp, and gets on to the platform like everyone else.</p> <p>To anyone accustomed to the House of Windsor, it is a style which seems unpretentious almost to the point of pretentiousness. But it works. There is no debate about the monarchy in Norway. The people support both the idea of the royal family and the reality. It used to be said that soon there would only be five kings left: the king of England, hearts, spades, clubs and diamonds. No one makes that crack any more. There have been moments over the past few years when it has seemed doubtful that there would ever be another king of England.</p> <p>Yet the adroitness of King Juan Carlos has been a major factor in helping Spain escape from a traumatic recent history. King Albert II of Belgium, has provided at least some kind of unifying factor in a country where people can agree on nothing. And in Holland, Denmark and Sweden, the monarchy has become ever more entrenched. The lesson is that success does not depend on grandeur. It seems strange that Scandinavia, a region with a reputation for rationality, should be so attached to royalty. It seems doubly strange in Norway, which has been independent for less than a century. It extricated itself from Swedish rule only in 1905. There was a referendum, which opted for a monarchy rather than a republic by 3-1.</p> <p>\"There was a little sentimentality, a dream of a golden age,\" says the historian Karsten Alnaes. \"They wanted the return of the great old times.\"</p> <p>But the great old times were more than 500 years behind them: the Norwegians hadn't had any monarchs since the 14th century. They had to find one. Prince Carl of Denmark had the right CV and no prospects in his own country. The Norwegians traditionally get on well with the Danes (they are less keen on the Swedes) and admire the English. Carl's mother was Queen Maud, youngest daughter of Edward VII. He got the job. And he did it brilliantly. He put himself into the line of medieval kings by taking the very Norwegian title Haakon VII, and the motto \"All for Norway\", and reigned for 52 years. Two moments defined his position. In 1928 there was a governmental crisis, which could only be solved by royal intervention. The Social Democrats, then strongly Marxist, had the largest grouping and, despite furious opposition, the king asked them to take charge. They only lasted 14 days in power, but the gesture had been made. \"You have to remember,\" Haakon said famously, \"that I'm king of the communists too.\"</p> <p>In 1940 came forces not susceptible to the royal touch. The Nazis wanted the king to stay and do their bidding. He and his family escaped instead, having given them a simple answer: \"No.\"</p> <p>Haakon used his exile to act as a rallying point. (His fame did not spread. When he went into Bush House in London to do one of his broadcasts for the BBC, the receptionist was somewhat harassed: \"Sorry, dear, where did you say you were king of?\")</p> <p>Haakon returned to Norway, more popular than ever, and the post-war reconstruction was led by the now much-moderated Social Democrats. His earlier gesture was the springboard for an alliance between the monarchy and the Left that has never seriously wavered. His son, Olav V, who reigned from 1957 to 1991, had a similar instinct for the crucial symbolic gesture. During the oil crisis of 1973, Olav was planning a very Norwegian day out, cross-country skiing just outside Oslo like everyone else. He caught a tram and paid for his ticket. It was an act of solidarity at a difficult time. A newspaper photographer just happened to be on the tram and took one of Norway's most famous pictures. It says a great deal about the Norwegians that most of them still regard this as one of life's happy coincidences and not a pre-arranged stunt.</p> <p>In eight years on the throne, Olav's son, Harald, has never quite shown the same knack. His speech last year to Clinton, Barak and Arafat when the Middle East peace talks returned to Oslo was surprisingly eloquent; Norwegians thought it sounded magnificently sincere, even if it was drafted by the foreign ministry. Overall, though, he is regarded as shy, a bit awkward, a touch dull, perhaps. In other words, Norwegians seem to think, rather like most of them. And that's the secret.</p> <p>There is no aristocracy in Norway; most of the nobles were wiped out by the Black Death and the rest were abolished in the 19th century. This makes the place very different from, say, Denmark, which is full of barons. It is hard even to notice much of an upper class, as ostentatiousness is a national no-no. The king was an Olympic yachtsman and still sails avidly but he makes sure the crew represents Norwegian society as a whole. There are no minor royals: the only ones on the (modest) payroll are the king, queen and their two children. This is royalty tailored to a country whose instincts appear wholly republican.</p> <p>Harald married Sonja, the daughter of an Oslo shopkeeper, a fairly grand one, but a shopkeeper none the less. There is hardly any private schooling, so the royal children went to ordinary state schools, starting at a municipal nursery, and they led, to an extent unthinkable among our royals, ordinary Oslo childhoods. Crown Prince Haakon, now 26, lives in an ordinary, if smart, bachelor flat, in a ordinarily run-down area of Oslo. Prince Charles once dismissed the Scandinavian monarchies as \"grander, more pompous, harder to approach than we are\". This remark makes no sense.</p> <p>But the very ordinariness of the Norwegian royals has its drawbacks. Currently, the palace is being refurbished. There have been huge cost overruns, and one of the tabloid papers led a campaign blaming the queen for interfering and insisting on absurd extravagances like gold leaf in the ballroom. \"This country is absolutely two-faced,\" said one Briton who lives there. \"If you're going to refurbish a palace, you have to do it properly. Everyone knows that, but she gets the blame. On the one hand, they adore her as one of them. On the other hand, they think she's just a jumped-up squirt, she's no better than we are.\"</p> <p>As they say in our own royal circles, a counter-jumper.</p> <p>Only occasionally, though, have the Norwegian royals brushed with the press in the manner with which we are so familiar. The king's daughter, Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise, was once cited in a divorce case but royal prerogative meant she didn't have to go court, and the scandal was stifled. King Olav was a widower known to entertain ladies of a certain age. The crown prince is a rich bachelor with his own pad. \"We are not at all working in the paparazzi manner,\" says Kjell Arne, royal correspondent of Norway's top-selling weekly magazine, Se \u00f8g Hor. \"We don't follow them.\"</p> <p>If one of the paper's photographers happened to see the crown prince in a restaurant with a new girlfriend, would he or she take a picture? \"No,\" says Arne. If someone sent him such a picture, would he use it? He paused. \"Not necessarily.\"</p> <p>\"Of course, we have had incidents with the press,\" says the king's private secretary, Magne Hagen. \"But in general we have been very happy. The crown prince has spoken out clearly once or twice about what he feels is right and what is intrusive, and it has been understood.\"</p> <p>The Norwegian press is not the world's most ferocious and the rest of the world cares little about Norway. Who on earth would want to chase their royals into a Paris underpass? This is a country with only four million people: a place that is together, in more than one sense of the word. Theoretically, the king has considerable power to intervene in politics; with elections by proportional representation and a lot of coalition-building to be done, he could easily be interfering all the time. He doesn't have to, because the Norwegian instinct for consensus renders it unnecessary.</p> <p>That consensus extends to the monarchy. It can be seen best on Norway's national day, when all the children parade past the Slott waving their flags, while the royals wave back until their arms almost drop off; in less than a century, the monarchy and the country have become indistinguishable. An Oslo journalist I know tells people at parties that he is a republican: \"They just laugh at me,\" he says.</p> <p>This is the way it was in 50s Britain. Perhaps Britain has moved on too far for those days to come back. It seems hard to imagine the Norwegian model being transplanted to a larger, less cohesive, more disputatious, more alienated, more class-ridden country - even one with a deep affection for its monarchy despite a certain disenchantment with the current dynasty.</p> <p>But what if another north European country were to regain its independence after hundreds of years? A place not far from Norway, with many ethnic and economic connections? A place that, like Norway, had had its own kings? A place of similar size, and not dissimilar climate?</p> <p>Far be it from me to suggest how an independent Scotland might run its affairs. But Norway offers the proof that monarchy \"on the face of it an irrational choice for a new country\" can provide a very rational way of making it work.</p>",

Dragoljub Prcac, 62, the camp's former deputy commander, was last night at a British base in Banja Luka, awaiting transfer to the Hague for trial by the international war crimes tribunal. British forces, spearheaded by the SAS, have seized a string of war crimes suspects in the last few years. Mr Prcac's arrest was the result of a long, carefully planned operation.

The supermarket chain's promotion will encompass more than 4,000 items, reducing prices by a total of \u00a317m. Asda's Rollback promotion began a year ago but has concentrated on food so far. Total price cuts have exceeded \u00a3200m. The company is now attacking the clothes market, backed by a television advertising campaign beginning on Thursday. The chain has gained customers at the expense of struggling rivals such as Somerfield, which yesterday responded to suggestions that chief executive David Simons was plotting to take the company private by saying: \"This really is just rumour and speculation.\" The report suggested that Mr Simons was holding talks with private equity firms, including US group Apollo and Oaktreee Capital Management. The company's market capitalisation is \u00a3315m, having plunged over the last year after a botched takeover of smaller retailer Kwik Save. Shareholders will get the chance to question Mr Simons today at an extraordinary general meeting to vote on the sale of 45 of its larger stores for \u00a3305m. \u0095 Boots has launched a website dedicated to men's grooming and fitness: \n<a>www.boots-men.co.uk</a>",

But Sir Brian failed to secure any bonus - unlike Peter Ellwood, chief executive, whose \u00a3245,000 increased his overall pay to \u00a3807,000.

Fuelled by the extraordinary presence of Lecavalier, a ferocious athlete given to making triple-twist crashes to the floor and chest-pressing her male partners above her head, La La La's wild and unpredictable performances kicked against a dance establishment that prized craft and commitment above emotion and energy. </p> <p>It was no surprise when Lock went on to choreograph David Bowie's 1990 Sound and Vision tour, Louise Lecavalier's trademark physical derring-do providing a perfect counterpoint to the rock stylings of the Thin White Duke. </p> <p>Riding that wave, La La La Human Steps has become a global dance phenomenon. Their new show, Salt, which opens in London tomorrow before moving on to Edinburgh, is in the second year of a world tour that takes in more than 150 dates in 60-plus cities, stretching from Lock's native Montreal to cities as far afield as Rio and Tokyo. </p> <p>With a mighty fan base built on the kinetic excitement of shows such as Human Sex and New Demons, it would be easy for Lock and Lecavalier to set the controls on autopilot. But, after six months working on the show Lecavalier has left, unwilling to commit to such a demanding tour. The focus has also shifted: for Salt, Lock has decided to use six women performing on pointes, ballet's traditional, establishment stock-in-trade. What's the point? Lock, who had no classical training himself, seems surprised by the question. \"Ballet technique is just that, a technique. I'm fascinated by the way the body can move and the way we perceive it. I think we're kind of over looking at ballet as the enemy - why can't any choreographer use it?\" </p> <p>It's a fine theory, but what comes as part and parcel of traditional balletic technique is that a male and female duet comes down to a man holding up a woman. And to take that on board is quite a leap for a company that has carved out a reputation based on physical egalitarianism. \"It's true that in some ways the men are sometimes there just to provide a physical compensation for the women,\" admits Lock, \"but in the end it would fall apart if it wasn't a question of mutual interdependence. When you put men and women together on stage there's always a tendency to look on it as a political statement and I don't think I'm interested in that. Even when we started, and Louise was throwing men about, it was a physical expression rather than a political one.\" </p> <p>It is true that Salt is a world away from ballet in any conventional sense. The six women stick to pointe, but when the men are let loose from their couplings they roll and tumble in a display of gymnastic liberation. And the speed with which the women skitter across the floor, limbs jack-knifing into corkscrew vertical take-off, borders on the life-threatening. All of which runs counter to the mood of curiously aggressive sadness that Salt creates. \"It's not an overly joyous piece, but then I'm not an overly joyous person,\" reflects Lock, ruefully. \"The idea of calling it Salt was to suggest some kind of residue. It takes place as the aftermath of some undefined sad event; it's the shadow world of an emotional overspill.\" </p> <p>That makes Salt sound almost swathed in melancholy. But it also has the sharp tang of conflict and aggression; it is not only a technical tour de force but a world of disturbed and brooding characters. The effect is backed up by the black-and-white half-lighting and a live score (by David Lang and My Funny Valentine's Kevin Shields) that ranges in style from classical minimalism to stabbing bursts of electric guitar feedback. The only light relief comes from brief filmed sections (Lock, a true Renaissance man, is the director) which feature circular screens bouncing across a black sky. The image of a smiling baby is an innocent contrast to our older, more self-absorbed selves. </p> <p>Lock is clearly taken aback at dark interpretations of a show which pushes his 10 classically trained dancers through 100 relentless minutes of punishing physical rigour. Wrapped deep within the work, he talks earnestly of structures and physical abstractions, falling into philosophical silence when he ponders that most punters lack the capacity to relate to \"pure\" dance, when it's stripped of extraneous trappings such as music, lighting and costume. </p> <p>We're heading straight for Pseuds Corner, so it's time to get back to basics. How is the tour going? \"In Los Angeles they were laughing,\" says Lock. \"Maybe it's only the English who see all this anguish.\" </p> <p>La La La Human Steps is at Sadler's Wells (0171-863 8000), London N1, from tomorrow till March 11, and at the Festival Theatre (0131-529 6000), Edinburgh, from March 17-18.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>From a Daleks' home in Cornwall to a Welsh update of Kew's Victorian elegance:  Jonathan Glancey investigates hi-tech design in garden buildings</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Think plants, pondlife, ecology and conservation and the architecture that plods into mind is shaggy, fuzzy and a bit wobbly looking, the tectonic equivalent of a muddy wellington boot. Geraniums in hanging baskets. Trellises. Clapboard sheds built from cheap pine. Fake-stone urns. Sad-looking terracotta pots. </p> <p>It doesn't have to be like this. Kew Gardens boasts the Palm House (1844-48): a masterpiece of early-Victorian engineering and one of the finest garden buildings of all. Its jelly-mould shape is a delight, and the way the tropical plants wind and snake among cast-iron columns and spiral stairs inside its steamy glass walls is the stuff of Dr Livingstone fantasies. Here nature, in the guise of palms, rubber plants and the scary-looking trees that creep across mangrove swamps, is in a state of equipoise with architecture. </p> <p>Three British architectural practices - Foster and Partners, the Nicholas Grimshaw Partnership and Future Systems - are working on expansive and ambitious garden buildings. All demonstrate their well known love of hi-tech engineering. The National Botanic Garden of Wales in Carmarthenshire, the Eden Project in Cornwall, and the Earth Centre in Yorkshire are all millennium projects, each boasts some of the most intriguing and delightful buildings to have emerged from British practices in the past five years. Together they mark the coming together of sophisticated modern design with nature, the export of an architecture bred in urban hothouses to the countryside. </p> <p>Foster's elegant glasshouse in the restored 18th-century grounds of Middleton Hall in Carmarthenshire is the most straightforward of the three. This is Kew's Palm House brought convincingly up to date. It will house endangered plants from Mediterranean climates and will offer a walk along gangways and across bridges through lush vegetation in much the same way as its Victorian predecessor does. The nearly completed building demonstrates how well even a large glasshouse sits alongside a historic architecture of brick, stone and stucco; and how well their pregnant forms sit in rolling Welsh landscapes. </p> <p>Grimshaw's Martian domes near St Austell in Cornwall blow like giant soap bubbles from deep inside the steep, 60-metre walls of the former Bodelva China Clay pit. Cornwall's is a particularly beautiful landscape, although pitted with unsightly remains of tin-mines, clay pits and holiday caravans. The first two are being dealt with slowly by schemes like the ambitious Eden Project; the caravans are surely there to stay. </p> <p>The geodesic domes that will shelter humid tropical and warm temperate flora, algae and other primitive or simple animal life are the stuff of sci-fi fantasy. What springs to mind are those Dr Who adventures that for reasons of cost nearly always took place in disused quarries. The Eden Project looks like a home for retired Daleks - although the Daleks, keener on extermination than conservation, would never have taken to the exotic plantlife that will gestate and bloom under Grimshaw's domes. </p> <p>Up to 45 metres high, these are computer-generated developments of the geodesic domes invented by the US engineer Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983), who for a time was an associate partner of Norman Foster's. Such domes, which dissolved the boundary between wall and roof, offer the maximum volume of space for least possible mass. These lightweight structures seem to match the astonishing strength, flexibility and beauty of the plants they house. </p> <p>Grimshaw's domes have been morphed into exotic shapes. The spaces between the honeycomb-like components are filled with triple skins of ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) foil, which offers greater thermal insulation than glass. It is a recyclable material that stands up well to the effects of direct sunlight. This promises to shine for much of the year on the Eden domes: solar energy is stored in the south facing 60-metre deep walls of the former clay pit and released by night. </p> <p>A visitor centre at the \u00a353m Eden Project opens in May. Given Cornwall's holiday traffic it is likely to prove very popular, drawing adults and children like butterflies to buddleia. This ETFE-generation Garden of Eden will take visitors on a tour inside and outside the domes through all the world's major ecosystems, in an area the size of 30 football pitches. It promises to be a remarkable - and only slightly dotty - experience. </p> <p>As for the Earth Centre on the outskirts of Doncaster, not a lot appears to be happening. This is partly a question of location: a former waste tip for south Yorkshire coalmines is clearly at a disadvantage compared to the prospect of a trip to sunny Cornwall or the rolling hills of deep rural Wales. Doncaster used to be famous worldwide for the locomotives it built - Mallard and The Flying Scotsman among them - as well as for racing and mining. Today it has little to offer visitors. </p> <p>The Earth Centre was always intended to be a long-term venture, and has been written off all too quickly for failing to draw visitors. Still, it is a millennium project funded by the national lottery, and just as people hope to become millionaires overnight, so we expect millennium projects to be packed out with millions of visitors instantly. </p> <p>Sadly, the one real attraction that would have given the Earth Centre the pull on visitors it needs has been shelved, for the time being at least.

      "bodyText": "Think plants, pondlife, ecology and conservation and the architecture that plods into mind is shaggy, fuzzy and a bit wobbly looking, the tectonic equivalent of a muddy wellington boot. Geraniums in hanging baskets. Trellises. Clapboard sheds built from cheap pine. Fake-stone urns. Sad-looking terracotta pots. It doesn't have to be like this. Kew Gardens boasts the Palm House (1844-48): a masterpiece of early-Victorian engineering and one of the finest garden buildings of all. Its jelly-mould shape is a delight, and the way the tropical plants wind and snake among cast-iron columns and spiral stairs inside its steamy glass walls is the stuff of Dr Livingstone fantasies. Here nature, in the guise of palms, rubber plants and the scary-looking trees that creep across mangrove swamps, is in a state of equipoise with architecture. Three British architectural practices - Foster and Partners, the Nicholas Grimshaw Partnership and Future Systems - are working on expansive and ambitious garden buildings. All demonstrate their well known love of hi-tech engineering. The National Botanic Garden of Wales in Carmarthenshire, the Eden Project in Cornwall, and the Earth Centre in Yorkshire are all millennium projects, each boasts some of the most intriguing and delightful buildings to have emerged from British practices in the past five years. Together they mark the coming together of sophisticated modern design with nature, the export of an architecture bred in urban hothouses to the countryside. Foster's elegant glasshouse in the restored 18th-century grounds of Middleton Hall in Carmarthenshire is the most straightforward of the three. This is Kew's Palm House brought convincingly up to date. It will house endangered plants from Mediterranean climates and will offer a walk along gangways and across bridges through lush vegetation in much the same way as its Victorian predecessor does. The nearly completed building demonstrates how well even a large glasshouse sits alongside a historic architecture of brick, stone and stucco; and how well their pregnant forms sit in rolling Welsh landscapes. Grimshaw's Martian domes near St Austell in Cornwall blow like giant soap bubbles from deep inside the steep, 60-metre walls of the former Bodelva China Clay pit. Cornwall's is a particularly beautiful landscape, although pitted with unsightly remains of tin-mines, clay pits and holiday caravans. The first two are being dealt with slowly by schemes like the ambitious Eden Project; the caravans are surely there to stay. The geodesic domes that will shelter humid tropical and warm temperate flora, algae and other primitive or simple animal life are the stuff of sci-fi fantasy. What springs to mind are those Dr Who adventures that for reasons of cost nearly always took place in disused quarries. The Eden Project looks like a home for retired Daleks - although the Daleks, keener on extermination than conservation, would never have taken to the exotic plantlife that will gestate and bloom under Grimshaw's domes. Up to 45 metres high, these are computer-generated developments of the geodesic domes invented by the US engineer Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983), who for a time was an associate partner of Norman Foster's. Such domes, which dissolved the boundary between wall and roof, offer the maximum volume of space for least possible mass. These lightweight structures seem to match the astonishing strength, flexibility and beauty of the plants they house. Grimshaw's domes have been morphed into exotic shapes. The spaces between the honeycomb-like components are filled with triple skins of ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) foil, which offers greater thermal insulation than glass. It is a recyclable material that stands up well to the effects of direct sunlight. This promises to shine for much of the year on the Eden domes: solar energy is stored in the south facing 60-metre deep walls of the former clay pit and released by night. A visitor centre at the \u00a353m Eden Project opens in May. Given Cornwall's holiday traffic it is likely to prove very popular, drawing adults and children like butterflies to buddleia. This ETFE-generation Garden of Eden will take visitors on a tour inside and outside the domes through all the world's major ecosystems, in an area the size of 30 football pitches. It promises to be a remarkable - and only slightly dotty - experience. As for the Earth Centre on the outskirts of Doncaster, not a lot appears to be happening. This is partly a question of location: a former waste tip for south Yorkshire coalmines is clearly at a disadvantage compared to the prospect of a trip to sunny Cornwall or the rolling hills of deep rural Wales. Doncaster used to be famous worldwide for the locomotives it built - Mallard and The Flying Scotsman among them - as well as for racing and mining. Today it has little to offer visitors. The Earth Centre was always intended to be a long-term venture, and has been written off all too quickly for failing to draw visitors. Still, it is a millennium project funded by the national lottery, and just as people hope to become millionaires overnight, so we expect millennium projects to be packed out with millions of visitors instantly. Sadly, the one real attraction that would have given the Earth Centre the pull on visitors it needs has been shelved, for the time being at least. This is the elegant Ark, or exhibition centre, designed by Future Systems (Jan Kaplicky and Amanda Levete, who last year won the Stirling prize for their media centre at Lord's cricket ground). Shaped like a great butterfly, the Ark was to have landed with delicacy and grace on a gently sloping hillside on the edge of the ecological gardens. It would be great to see the Ark built, if not in South Yorkshire then elsewhere in the wilds of Wales, Scotland or Ireland. These three designs - Ark, glasshouse and computer-morphed domes - are some of the most likeable to have sprouted from hi-tech British architecture. They deserve to succeed and to be nurtured as carefully as the plants they will protect.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Big Brother is watching you. Not only is he counting the minutes you spend away from your desk on your lunch break, but he's checking what you eat in the office canteen. Calorie counting is no longer the preserve of the weight-obsessed - be prepared for your boss taking an unhealthy interest in your healthy eating regime. </p> <p>It's a prospect to make anyone slightly queasy as they tuck into a canteen pork pie, but this is what the nutrition education company Energise believes will soon be the norm in many companies. Indeed, some larger firms are already taking a close look at their employees' nutrition. So what's going on? Have employers really become so caring that they are encouraging you to stick to that diet you've always been too weak-willed to keep up? </p> <p>Not likely. Far more probable is that employers are alarmed at the latest surveys, such as those by Maine-Tucker Recruitment and Nimble, the bread-makers, revealing that a quarter of employees don't take lunch breaks and consequently don't eat properly. The result is not, as previously assumed, that staff work longer and harder. Rather, it is proven to lead to lack of productivity and an increase in absence. </p> <p>\"If human resources departments want to get the most out of their staff, they need to review staff diets,\" says Penny Hunking, managing director of Energise, which is undertaking the largest ever study of eating habits in the workplace. By getting employees to complete diet diaries, she hopes to persuade employers not only to give us time to eat, but to provide healthy stuff to tuck into as well. </p> <p>\"The introduction of company gyms is one example of how health and welfare issues are creeping up the management agenda,\" says Hunking. \"The emphasis on what employees eat is, I believe, the next step.\" </p> <p>Branding consultancy Wolff Olins is one company that has already jumped on the bandwagon. Jane Houghton, a former deputy editor of the Sainsbury's magazine and now responsible for the kitchen and restaurant at Wolff Olins, fought hard to banish stodge from the workplace canteen. Now almost everyone stops work at 1pm and resumes at 2pm, spending the interim eating fresh salads and crispbreads. </p> <p>\"The break is as important as the food,\" she believes. \"It gives you a chance to socialise and network with staff at all levels in one of the only places where hierarchy is irrelevant. In any case, to be at your most creative, you need the time away from your desk during the day just as you need time away from the office during weekends.\" </p> <p>One company has taken things even further. Deloitte Consulting now offers employees workshops on nutritional issues.

      "bodyText": "Big Brother is watching you. Not only is he counting the minutes you spend away from your desk on your lunch break, but he's checking what you eat in the office canteen. Calorie counting is no longer the preserve of the weight-obsessed - be prepared for your boss taking an unhealthy interest in your healthy eating regime. It's a prospect to make anyone slightly queasy as they tuck into a canteen pork pie, but this is what the nutrition education company Energise believes will soon be the norm in many companies. Indeed, some larger firms are already taking a close look at their employees' nutrition. So what's going on? Have employers really become so caring that they are encouraging you to stick to that diet you've always been too weak-willed to keep up? Not likely. Far more probable is that employers are alarmed at the latest surveys, such as those by Maine-Tucker Recruitment and Nimble, the bread-makers, revealing that a quarter of employees don't take lunch breaks and consequently don't eat properly. The result is not, as previously assumed, that staff work longer and harder. Rather, it is proven to lead to lack of productivity and an increase in absence. \"If human resources departments want to get the most out of their staff, they need to review staff diets,\" says Penny Hunking, managing director of Energise, which is undertaking the largest ever study of eating habits in the workplace. By getting employees to complete diet diaries, she hopes to persuade employers not only to give us time to eat, but to provide healthy stuff to tuck into as well. \"The introduction of company gyms is one example of how health and welfare issues are creeping up the management agenda,\" says Hunking. \"The emphasis on what employees eat is, I believe, the next step.\" Branding consultancy Wolff Olins is one company that has already jumped on the bandwagon. Jane Houghton, a former deputy editor of the Sainsbury's magazine and now responsible for the kitchen and restaurant at Wolff Olins, fought hard to banish stodge from the workplace canteen. Now almost everyone stops work at 1pm and resumes at 2pm, spending the interim eating fresh salads and crispbreads. \"The break is as important as the food,\" she believes. \"It gives you a chance to socialise and network with staff at all levels in one of the only places where hierarchy is irrelevant. In any case, to be at your most creative, you need the time away from your desk during the day just as you need time away from the office during weekends.\" One company has taken things even further. Deloitte Consulting now offers employees workshops on nutritional issues. Partner John Everett says: \"We have even paid for staff to have private consultations with nutritional specialists to identify their own deficiencies. We have had a 100% take-up rate and absence levels have dropped significantly.\" Those tempted to dismiss all this nutritional motivation stuff and rely on the four o'clock chocolate run should think again. You might feel as though the boost has done your motivation no end of good, but snacks that are high in fat, sugar, caffeine and salt all contribute to yet more imbalance in soaring and crashing energy levels. Penny Hunking believes the trend towards breakfast meetings is the best thing support staff have introduced in years. \"Not only is this because breakfast eaters have a higher health and fitness level, but because it brings attention to the correlation between food and creativity.\" Anyone for bacon and fried eggs? Sorry, make that herbal tea and muesli.",

      "body": "<p>When Debra McAllister started her new job as PA to a television producer, the location was one of the major factors in her decision. \"I'd always wanted to work in the West End,\" she says, \"and my workplace was an easy commute on the tube.\" </p> <p>But the good times weren't to last. \"I was gutted when they suddenly announced that my department was moving to another office near Dorking in Surrey. The travelling was going to be hideous - but more than that, I was outraged by how they broke the news. We were told by email, rather than in person, and just three weeks before the move.\" </p> <p>When a company relocates, the upheaval can be massive - whether you decide to move with the company or resign from your job. A recent IRS survey found that the average cost of relocating an employee is approximately \u00a315,000 - and although it is commonly thought that only managers and senior staff are relocated, more than half the companies in the study said that they moved administrative and clerical staff as well. </p> <p>\"Its all down to what's in your contract,\" says Sue Nickson of Hammond Suddards, employment law specialists. \"A lot of contracts will contain a 'mobility clause' - where the company reserves the right to ask you to move within a reasonable distance - and the approximate notice period they have to give.\" </p> <p>While McAllister concedes her contract does include a such a clause, she thinks the way the company has handled the move is anything but reasonable. \"They have said they'll talk to us about relocation packages, about paying our travel, and that we'll all have an individual meeting with personnel. But all they've done is collect facts - where we travel from, if we would think about moving - and more senior staff have been treated exactly the same way. Everyone is furious - but with only a week to go before we move, most people simply haven't got the time to look for another job. I'm going to have to go to Dorking - even though it's a two-hour journey each way - but after the way I've been treated, I am actively looking for another job.\" </p> <p>So why do companies risk alienating their staff and embark on a logistically terrifying office move? One of the prime reasons to relocate from city centres to somewhere out-of-town, unsurprisingly, is the vast difference in cost. According to property company DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, office rental in Mayfair, central London, costs \u00a362.50 per square foot, and in the City \u00a352.50. Compare that with an average rent of \u00a326 in Surrey and the sums calculate themselves. Rents in central London are the highest in western Europe, but according to Guy Lambert, associate director of Jones Lang LaSalle, cost is not the only factor. </p> <p>\"There is a trend for city-centre, big offices with everyone under one roof,\" says Lambert. \"But there are still companies that are relocating - and not always for financial reasons. Bracknell is hugely popular for companies and a big reason for that is a lot of managing directors or CEOs live in Ascot or neighbouring areas. I have dealt with several companies which are moving simply so that the office is closer to where the MD lives.\" </p> <p>As rents continue to rise, and the demand for office accommodation outstrips availability, there is a good chance that more companies will choose to move. According to the IRS survey, 50% of the companies they interviewed have seen an increase in employee relocation and moves - and with the increasing reliance on email and internet, being located in big cities will become less important. </p> <p>It's particularly galling to have to relocate just because your MD wants to be closer to the golf club. So what rights do humble employees have if they find themselves in this position? \"If you have a good reason for not being able to relocate, then the company has to make you redundant - although simply saying that you don't want to do a long commute may not be seen as reason enough,\" says Nickson. \"It's known as 'workplace redundancy' - basically the office where you are based is no longer able to offer you a job. Again the redundancy terms depend on what is in your contract, but even if redundancy is not mentioned, you should still be eligible for statutory redundancy pay.\" </p> <p>According to research by Dr Robin Martin, of the school of psychology at Cardiff university, companies which attempt to cut corners when relocating without providing proper support to their staff are storing up major problems for themselves. \"Moving job and house can both be stressful events,\" he says, \"but when they co-occur, high levels of stress may well be experienced by the person relocating and their family. The results of our study prove that pre-move preparation - in terms of relevant information and the opportunity to have a say in the move - can significantly improve mental wellbeing following the relocation.\" </p> <p>For Sandie Wilmot, the relocation from north London to Docklands of her department in a telecommunications company ended as a positive experience, because her company took account of her circumstances. \"I live near Harrow so the commute to Docklands was a nightmare,\" she says. \"I have a young child and it meant my Mum having to look after him for such long hours. </p> <p>\"When we got news of the move, I had a meeting with my personnel officer, who was great - explained why we were moving, what support the company was offering if people wanted to move. I couldn't move, but I didn't want to leave the company. We agreed that I would go to Docklands, but if a position that suited me came up in the north London office, I could move back. Three months later I moved - into a more responsible position for more money.\" </p> <p>But other companies may be guilty of viewing in a negative light those employees who are unwilling to relocate. \"Increasingly the trend is that employees are expected to be mobile,\" says Nickson, \"whether it's relocating to a different part of the country, or going on secondment just for a few months.\" But the situation is often further complicated by a partner or children who do not wish to move - although its important to realise that these are factors that the company should also take into account. According to the IRS survey, 45% of companies offered assistance in finding a job for the partner - assuming, of course, that they are happy to move. </p> <p>Increasingly, relocation is becoming a fact of working life - and the best strategy for coping, say the experts, is to be aware of your rights and know what to expect. \"It's important to feel you have a say, to have a chance to discuss the move with those who are responsible for managing it,\" says Martin. </p> <p>Debra McAllister agrees, \"Right from the start we've just been told how things are going to be,\" she says, \"and that's the hardest thing. The company has been so high-handed, so careless with all of us. I've never felt so powerless in my life.\"</p>",

His new album, Love and the Russian Winter, is so called, explains Mick, because that meteorological phenomenon saved the world from both Napoleon and Hitler.
