Henze composed this music-theatre piece in 1969-70, after his visit to Castro's Cuba. Committed to the ideals of international socialism, Henze worked on the plantations, gave masterclasses and premiered his Sixth Symphony in Havana. </p> <p>El Cimarron was conceived in the midst of this revolutionary fervour, and sets texts by Esteban Montejo. Montejo is the \"cimarron\", the \"runaway slave\" of the title, and the stories of the horrors of slavery, abuse and attempted escapes are his experiences. </p> <p>Henze's settings resulted from months of collaboration with the original performers. With the solo baritone, percussionist, guitarist and flautist, Henze experimented with tortuous instrumental effects, and developed elaborate graphic notations. El Cimarron presents a special challenge to modern performers, since the fabric of the piece relies on their own creativity and imagination as much as it does on Henze's composition. </p> <p>The performance by Psappha, the Manchester-based new music ensemble, featured bass-baritone Stephen Bowen, and a production by Soutra Gilmour. Everything about their interpretation was careful and considered, from the subtle way the lighting suggested different scenes to the detail of the players' performances. </p> <p>Bowen told his horrific tales with the intimacy of a benevolent bedtime story. The soft-focused sounds of Allan Neave's guitar and Claire O'Neill's flutes were expertly balanced, while Tim Williams's percussion created everything from rustling backdrops to dramatic thunderclaps. </p> <p>But this perfection was also the biggest problem with this production. There was little sense of anger in Bowen's interpretation, and the players never seemed to be inspired by improvisatory passion. The political force of Montejo's words was neutered by their approach, and the effect was listless and fragmented rather than combative and dynamic. El Cimarron was divorced from its roots in revolutionary struggle, and Henze's relent lessly abstract musical idiom seemed to obscure the directness of Montejo's imagery rather than amplify it. </p> <p>The Endymion Ensemble's afternoon concert showcased Henze's chamber music of the late 1940s. Apollo et Hyazinthus is an astonishingly assured work, written in 1949, which shows how quickly Henze assimilated modernist idioms into his personal style. A single-movement harpsichord concerto that turns into a scena for mezzo-soprano, it is structurally lucid and warmly expressive. </p> <p>Louise Mott and the Endymions gave a completely convincing performance, and the players were equally impressive in Henze's 1948 Kammersonate for piano trio. The programme, designed by Henze himself, also included Oliver Knussen's Oc\u00e9an de Terre, a crystalline setting of Apollinaire, which featured soprano Eileen Hulse, and the world premiere of Kenneth Hesketh's fluent and accomplished Netsuke for eight-piece ensemble.</p>",

Her timing is immaculate, enabling her to retain the sense of urgent movement in a fastmoving piece, whether pegging it explicitly to the beat, or suddenly flooding the music with melody so intensified it barely seems constructed of individual notes. Slow features such as Angels emphasised Allen's concentration on the timbres of the piano, beginning obliquely and accelerating into a bell-pealing eagerness, with a little of Jarrett's clamorous harmony, while Feed the Fire - an uptempo postbop classic-to-be - brought out the best of Allen's originality of conception at speed (as well as the clean unfussiness of Johnson at the drums) before relaxing into a lazy blues.",

The report shows that performance-related criteria for the three-years between January 2000 and December 2002 for Andy Hornby, the 34-year-old head of the bank's retail operation, have been waived over shares worth \u00a3150,000.

Actor Jason Patric employs plenty of dramatic irony to capture the distasteful sense of descent in some stranger's appalling life. </p> <p>But LaBute pays finicky attention to hand gestures and his own distracted, staccato flow of speech. It's a David Mametesque stab at naturalism that becomes arch and mannered - to say nothing of the rather wearing cavernous pauses. </p> <p>Some of the same qualities pervade Medea Redux, in which a damaged young woman in custody (a pained, affecting performance by Flora Montgomery), tells her story: pregnant at 13 to a schoolteacher, an abandoned mother at 14.

      "bodyText": "The bad conscience of whiter-than-white New England is aired once again in this odd, dark trio of playlets by Neil LaBute, in a new production he directs himself. With a nod to Euripides, Iphigenia in Orem is a late-night confessional in the hotel bedroom of a salesman who, when his corporate livelihood was imperilled, smothered his infant daughter. Actor Jason Patric employs plenty of dramatic irony to capture the distasteful sense of descent in some stranger's appalling life. But LaBute pays finicky attention to hand gestures and his own distracted, staccato flow of speech. It's a David Mametesque stab at naturalism that becomes arch and mannered - to say nothing of the rather wearing cavernous pauses. Some of the same qualities pervade Medea Redux, in which a damaged young woman in custody (a pained, affecting performance by Flora Montgomery), tells her story: pregnant at 13 to a schoolteacher, an abandoned mother at 14. It gradually dawns that this is about a parallel act of child sacrifice. But, unlike corporate man, the woman doesn't get away with it, although we are left with more sympathy for her. Even sharper is A Gaggle of Saints, a more substantial, acidly charming duologue from a privileged, church-going, young Bostonian couple who attend a high school/ church reunion party in Manhattan. The direction is far snappier here, and Justine Mitchell's snobby trophy-gal is the perfect foil for Jason O'Mara's bombastic, preening performance as her boyfriend.

O'Mara hilariously depicts the homophobia of good, clean-living white America, but although true to life, it is a rather blunt instrument.

      "body": "<p>September 1999: I'm on a trading floor, talking down a phone, selling derivatives to an obstinate American client. I'm earning six figures a year, and I'm utterly miserable. Fast-forward a year. A different office. I'm still talking down a phone, but now I'm working for a homelessness charity. I'm earning nothing and I've never been happier. How the hell did that happen? </p> <p>After eight years in the Square Mile, my life in the fast lane had run out of gas. I no longer cared about the markets or my clients, and wasn't even bothered about my bonus. I snoozed in front of my screens, waking to find dribble on my desk. I was moody and moany, vacantly sullen, a fun guy to be with. </p> <p>Having hated my job for a year, my performance was pretty poor. I told myself that it was just temporary, but in my heart I knew my career was comatose. Yet how could I leave? What else could I possibly do? The markets provided few skills transferable to the real world, and nothing else paid nearly as well. It took a friend to open my eyes. On discovering the ruddy-faced health of my bank balances, she pointed out that I could afford to leave the next day: the only thing stopping me was myself. </p> <p>Only then did I begin to consider life outside the City. Over the next six months I applied for a few jobs, but my lack of conviction was transparent, and rewarded accordingly. I didn't know what I wanted to do; I only knew what I didn't. More months passed with me stuck in my silken rut until another friend got drunk to the point of truthfulness and, exasperated, snapped that I should \"go and work for a charity or something\". </p> <p>Immediately everything became obvious. I decided to take some time off and volunteer for a charity. If I guaranteed them six months, I reasoned, I would surely find an interesting, challenging job that would account for my time away from paid employment. Meanwhile I could rethink my options and look for a new career. Everyone would be a winner. All I had to do was find the charity. </p> <p>This proved to be the tricky part. There are a lot of voluntary organisations out there. With ignorant simplicity I discarded entire sectors and ultimately decided on 12, ranging from overseas aid to homelessness. I updated my CV, wrote some letters and sat back for the flood of replies. </p> <p>It was a long wait. After a month of silence I was getting discouraged. This was compounded by the few replies that tiptoed back. One said they were very keen and would be in touch. I never heard from them again. Another said they had no need for me, a third had envelopes to be stuffed. </p> <p>Finally I began to get some interest and arranged surreptitious meetings: with bonus time approaching, I didn't want anyone to know my plans. But the suggested jobs - databases, media monitoring - were useful rather than interesting. Not unreasonably, several people wanted me to twist some City arms into stumping up serious money. Yet the last thing I wanted was to turn up with a begging bowl and a big smile, trying to tap my former friends. </p> <p>After three months my plan was wobbling badly. The organisations I was talking to seemed to be in a state of chaos, or unable to think beyond the narrowest boundaries. Almost every one had failed to reply, lost my details, didn't want me or needed me only as unskilled office-fodder. Only a lucky break saved the situation. A friend of a friend suggested her old employer, a campaigning charity working with homeless people. It had been on my original list of 12. I had written to them twice but received no reply.

      "bodyText": "September 1999: I'm on a trading floor, talking down a phone, selling derivatives to an obstinate American client. I'm earning six figures a year, and I'm utterly miserable. Fast-forward a year. A different office. I'm still talking down a phone, but now I'm working for a homelessness charity. I'm earning nothing and I've never been happier. How the hell did that happen? After eight years in the Square Mile, my life in the fast lane had run out of gas. I no longer cared about the markets or my clients, and wasn't even bothered about my bonus. I snoozed in front of my screens, waking to find dribble on my desk. I was moody and moany, vacantly sullen, a fun guy to be with. Having hated my job for a year, my performance was pretty poor. I told myself that it was just temporary, but in my heart I knew my career was comatose. Yet how could I leave? What else could I possibly do? The markets provided few skills transferable to the real world, and nothing else paid nearly as well. It took a friend to open my eyes. On discovering the ruddy-faced health of my bank balances, she pointed out that I could afford to leave the next day: the only thing stopping me was myself. Only then did I begin to consider life outside the City. Over the next six months I applied for a few jobs, but my lack of conviction was transparent, and rewarded accordingly. I didn't know what I wanted to do; I only knew what I didn't. More months passed with me stuck in my silken rut until another friend got drunk to the point of truthfulness and, exasperated, snapped that I should \"go and work for a charity or something\". Immediately everything became obvious. I decided to take some time off and volunteer for a charity. If I guaranteed them six months, I reasoned, I would surely find an interesting, challenging job that would account for my time away from paid employment. Meanwhile I could rethink my options and look for a new career. Everyone would be a winner. All I had to do was find the charity. This proved to be the tricky part. There are a lot of voluntary organisations out there. With ignorant simplicity I discarded entire sectors and ultimately decided on 12, ranging from overseas aid to homelessness. I updated my CV, wrote some letters and sat back for the flood of replies. It was a long wait. After a month of silence I was getting discouraged. This was compounded by the few replies that tiptoed back. One said they were very keen and would be in touch. I never heard from them again. Another said they had no need for me, a third had envelopes to be stuffed. Finally I began to get some interest and arranged surreptitious meetings: with bonus time approaching, I didn't want anyone to know my plans. But the suggested jobs - databases, media monitoring - were useful rather than interesting. Not unreasonably, several people wanted me to twist some City arms into stumping up serious money. Yet the last thing I wanted was to turn up with a begging bowl and a big smile, trying to tap my former friends. After three months my plan was wobbling badly. The organisations I was talking to seemed to be in a state of chaos, or unable to think beyond the narrowest boundaries. Almost every one had failed to reply, lost my details, didn't want me or needed me only as unskilled office-fodder. Only a lucky break saved the situation. A friend of a friend suggested her old employer, a campaigning charity working with homeless people. It had been on my original list of 12. I had written to them twice but received no reply. She suggested I try again, and gave me a name. This short cut made progress delightfully swift. Within days I had met my new contact. She seemed enthusiastic and quickly came back with a proposal. As a history graduate with eight years of trading interest rates, I understood little of her spiel on green papers, but understood that she wanted me to research smart schemes that prevented or alleviated homelessness.

      "body": "<p>They are the glamour games that Leeds United's fans and directors have been dreaming of for years. Barcelona, Lazio, Real Madrid and AC Milan have all travelled to the Yorkshire club's Elland Road ground this season to contest the European Champions League under the gaze of a worldwide television audience. </p> <p>More often than not the home side has come out on top in football's most lucrative competition, delighting capacity crowds and those in the executive boxes enjoying corporate hospitality. </p> <p>This is English football's promised land. A domestic game on a high, fuelled financially by \u00a31.4bn of broadcasting revenues and millions more from merchandising, tickets and a booming corporate hospitality business. </p> <p>It has persuaded 27 football clubs in England, Scotland and Wales to list their shares on various domestic stock markets over the past 10 years. </p> <p>Yet for investors in Leeds United and almost every other club the revolution has never really happened. As an investment, football club shares now appear to be only for diehard fans. </p> <p>Six years after shares in Leeds Sporting began trading, at 14p, they are changing hand at just 12.75p, even though turnover in the past six months was greater than the whole of 1999. </p> <p><strong> Injection of cash</strong><br> </p> <p> It is a similar story at Chelsea Village in London where shares in the owner of the football club are trading at less than half their market debut value and last week touched an all-time low. That despite last year's injection of cash from broadcaster BSkyB, record shirt sponsorship and extra income from two hotels and a travel company. Chairman Ken Bates says profits have been depressed by the cost of developing leisure facilities that surround the club's Stamford Bridge stadium. </p> <p>Further north in the capital, even Sir Alan Sugar, the belligerent founder of Amstrad, has packed his bags and sold up at Tottenham Hotspur. He accepted an 80p per share offer from investment company Enic, even though two years ago he dismissed as too cheap a bid from the same company pitched at the same price. </p> <p>In a graphic illustration of how out of fashion football club shares are, Enic's stock price has fallen to a five-year low since it closed the deal to buy out Sir Alan. </p> <p>Of course, investors in poorly performing clubs have done even worse. Shares in Loftus Road, owner of Queens Park Rangers as well as Wasps rugby club, were delisted yesterday as the directors admitted that the club was urgently seeking a refinancing. After four years of straight losses, chairman Chris Wright has grown weary of writing out fresh cheques. </p> <p>Even shares in Manchester United, the sector's richest and best managed player which yesterday notched up half-year profits of \u00a317.3m, have fallen 60% over the past year. Analysts say the growth in player wages - Manchester United's David Beckham is reportedly negotiating English football's first \u00a3100,000-plus weekly pay packet - combined with an ongoing review of the transfer system, which could see assets worth millions leave clubs for nothing, has weighed heavily on football shares. </p> <p>\"The market capitalisation of football clubs bears no relation to their true asset values,\" says Peter Ridsdale, chairman of Leeds Sporting, who insists he cannot understand why his share price is so depressed. \"The football sector as a whole is clearly out of favour but surely we can't be valued properly?

      "bodyText": "They are the glamour games that Leeds United's fans and directors have been dreaming of for years. Barcelona, Lazio, Real Madrid and AC Milan have all travelled to the Yorkshire club's Elland Road ground this season to contest the European Champions League under the gaze of a worldwide television audience. More often than not the home side has come out on top in football's most lucrative competition, delighting capacity crowds and those in the executive boxes enjoying corporate hospitality. This is English football's promised land. A domestic game on a high, fuelled financially by \u00a31.4bn of broadcasting revenues and millions more from merchandising, tickets and a booming corporate hospitality business. It has persuaded 27 football clubs in England, Scotland and Wales to list their shares on various domestic stock markets over the past 10 years. Yet for investors in Leeds United and almost every other club the revolution has never really happened. As an investment, football club shares now appear to be only for diehard fans. Six years after shares in Leeds Sporting began trading, at 14p, they are changing hand at just 12.75p, even though turnover in the past six months was greater than the whole of 1999. Injection of cash It is a similar story at Chelsea Village in London where shares in the owner of the football club are trading at less than half their market debut value and last week touched an all-time low. That despite last year's injection of cash from broadcaster BSkyB, record shirt sponsorship and extra income from two hotels and a travel company. Chairman Ken Bates says profits have been depressed by the cost of developing leisure facilities that surround the club's Stamford Bridge stadium. Further north in the capital, even Sir Alan Sugar, the belligerent founder of Amstrad, has packed his bags and sold up at Tottenham Hotspur. He accepted an 80p per share offer from investment company Enic, even though two years ago he dismissed as too cheap a bid from the same company pitched at the same price. In a graphic illustration of how out of fashion football club shares are, Enic's stock price has fallen to a five-year low since it closed the deal to buy out Sir Alan. Of course, investors in poorly performing clubs have done even worse. Shares in Loftus Road, owner of Queens Park Rangers as well as Wasps rugby club, were delisted yesterday as the directors admitted that the club was urgently seeking a refinancing. After four years of straight losses, chairman Chris Wright has grown weary of writing out fresh cheques. Even shares in Manchester United, the sector's richest and best managed player which yesterday notched up half-year profits of \u00a317.3m, have fallen 60% over the past year. Analysts say the growth in player wages - Manchester United's David Beckham is reportedly negotiating English football's first \u00a3100,000-plus weekly pay packet - combined with an ongoing review of the transfer system, which could see assets worth millions leave clubs for nothing, has weighed heavily on football shares. \"The market capitalisation of football clubs bears no relation to their true asset values,\" says Peter Ridsdale, chairman of Leeds Sporting, who insists he cannot understand why his share price is so depressed. \"The football sector as a whole is clearly out of favour but surely we can't be valued properly? We're in the top five of the Premier League, we're in the quarter finals of the Champions League, we've done record sponsorship deals with big brands like Strongbow and Nike, we're controlling wage inflation and we've got one of the most valuable squads in the country.\" In the six months ended December 2000, turnover at Leeds Sporting climbed 67% to \u00a341m but profits fell from \u00a36.5m to \u00a395,000 year on year due largely to the \u00a318m purchase of defender Rio Ferdinand. Mr Ridsdale's complaint is echoed by chairmen at other clubs. Hugh Roberts recently left the Suffolk-based brewer Adnams to become chief executive of Sunderland plc. The club's shares have fallen 30% over the past year and now trade below their issue price. Mr Roberts says: \"At the moment the City doesn't see sustained profits in football clubs and it is up to us to show we can change that.\" In the six months ended last January, Sunderland's turnover climbed 25% to \u00a325.5m and pretax profit rose 33% to \u00a33.5m. Dan Jones, director of sport business at accountancy firm Deloitte &amp; Touche, says rising player wages remains the biggest threat to clubs' long-term profitability. \"As a rule of thumb, any club paying less than half of their turnover in total wages and salaries are carefully managing for the long term. Wages of over two-thirds of turnover are likely to be unsustainable in the long term and worryingly an increasing number of clubs are spending over that level. This is a crucial benchmark and the red light is already flashing.\" Deloitte &amp; Touche figures show that during the 1998-99 season 10 of the 20 Premiership clubs were already in the danger band, with Blackburn Rovers, Southampton and Liverpool the worst of fenders. Eighty per cent of all English professional clubs now exceed Deloitte &amp; Touche's two-thirds marker. A year ago those concerns seemed to be forgotten as media companies BSkyB, NTL and Granada Media invested in a string of top clubs including Arsenal, Aston Villa, Liverpool and Newcastle. The broadcasters typically bought a 9.9% stake in each, in return for a share of future media revenues. Share prices rose amid the excitement of the multi-million pound windfalls but fell as shareholders realised that the minority stakes seemed to rule offside outright takeovers. A renegotiated Premier League broadcasting contract kicks in at the start of next season and might bring some salvation for football club shareholders. Unproven concept It also brings the first regular pay per view games, which football clubs have long seen as a potential cash cow. However, PPV football is an unproven concept and several observers, such as Mr Ridsdale and an increasing number of City analysts, do not believe fans will be prepared to pay to watch games that are probably not even the best of the weekend.

Your won't earn high interest on the money - the rate is now about 4% - but you won't be in cash for long. There is more information on the <a href=\"http://www.fidelity.co.uk\">Fidelity website</a>.</p> <p>An alternative to phasing is to take advantage of special offers from fund managers. For example, Perpetual is allowing investors to hold its Isa allowance in cash until market conditions improve. If you haven't invested your money after six months, Perpetual will write to you asking you to sign a declaration of intent that you intend to invest in the future. </p> <p>This is to satisfy Inland Revenue regulations. You have control over when the money is invested and you can give Perpetual buying instructions when you eventually decide to buy.

One of the ways to reduce the risk is to use a facility called \"phasing\". This means you put your full Isa allowance (or as much as you can afford) into the fund now before the end of the tax year. That money is then drip-fed into the market. One of the fund managers offering this facility is Fidelity, which, on your behalf, then buys shares in parcels of \u00a31,000 at monthly intervals. In this way you achieve an average price of the six-month period without having to worry about the highs and the lows of the market. This method is also known as \"pound-cost averaging\". Your won't earn high interest on the money - the rate is now about 4% - but you won't be in cash for long. There is more information on the Fidelity website. An alternative to phasing is to take advantage of special offers from fund managers. For example, Perpetual is allowing investors to hold its Isa allowance in cash until market conditions improve. If you haven't invested your money after six months, Perpetual will write to you asking you to sign a declaration of intent that you intend to invest in the future. This is to satisfy Inland Revenue regulations. You have control over when the money is invested and you can give Perpetual buying instructions when you eventually decide to buy. There is more information at the Perpetual website. \u0095 Marianne Curphey is the editor of Guardian Unlimited Money and author of E-cash, the step-by-step guide to managing your money, mortgage, bank account, investments and shares online.

      "body": "<p>Barcelona coach Llorenc Serra Ferrar doesn't look like he's down with the kids, but after his side's 4-1 victory over Las Palmas he invited \"supporters to come en masse\" to a \"giant party\" on Thursday night. No surprises for guessing he's talking about the Uefa Cup game against Liverpool, but you can't blame Serra Ferrar for being strangely enthusiastic. After all, he'd just seen his side comeback from a fabulous goal from Guayre to administer a comprehensive shellacking to the side from Gran Canaria.</p> <p>His side were helped on their way by Las Palmas keeper Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez, who seemed to have been curiously effected by the proximity of Comedy Keeper Richard Dutruel. This in spite of the fact that the Frenchman was busy doing what he does best these days - warming the Bar\u00e7a bench. </p> <p>Desperately trying to emulate the Comedy Keeper and fellow slapstick merchant Tommy Cooper, the Las Palmas goalie gifted Bar\u00e7a their equaliser. He came for a corner, tripped over his own player, missed the ball, got up, barged over another of his own players - who was preparing to clear Gabri's pretty harmless header - and fell into the back of the net not so much with egg on his face as a bloody great omelette. Let off the hook, Bar\u00e7a took control and ran out 4-1 winners, with Marc Overmars, Rivaldo and Dani completing the scoring. </p> <p>Depor racked up a club record 24th consecutive home game unbeaten with an ultimately comfortable 4-2 win over Villarreal. Djalminha was busy show-boating again and he had a field day with the world's ropiest offside trap - he scored the first, set up Diego Trist\u00e1n for the second and watched from the bench (rested for Leeds) as Trist\u00e1n and substitute Roy Makaay got one more each.</p> <p>Celta's top scorer Catanha was back at his old club M\u00e1laga on Saturday and got two more in a 4-1 win. As a sign of \"respect\" to his former side, Catanha didn't perform his normal (and frankly shite) arm-flapping birdie celebration. The Rosaleda crowd, already suffering enough, certainly appreciated the gesture - they applauded their one-time hero from the field.</p> <p>It wasn't quite so easy for Real Madrid or Valencia. A superb Figo free-kick secured a 1-0 win for the Man in the Moustache's uninspiring side against Numancia, while Valencia surprisingly lost 1-0 at home to Espanyol. Yet again, Raul Tamudo was the match winner - this time with a powerful header from Toni Velamaz\u00e1n's cross. </p> <p>Juan Esnaider scored Zaragoza's only goal of the weekend as they fell 2-1 to Regueiro's last minute winner for Racing Santander's new boss Gustavo Ben\u00edtez. </p> <p>Esnaider still hasn't agreed to continue at the Romareda next year. In fact, rumours this week suggest that he'll return to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (possibly alongside Cholo Simeone), after it was revealed that he'd visited Jes\u00fas Gil at his country home. Of course, there's a perfectly rational information; Esnaider was, in fact, \"picking up a horse\". As you do. </p> <p>\"Jes\u00fas Gil gave me a horse\", Esnaider insisted, \"I went to collect it and met some friends for lunch - I've not even thought of signing for Atl\u00e9tico\". </p> <p><strong>Revolution at la Real</strong></p> <p>John Benjamin has \"moved upstairs\" at Real Sociedad (one day someone will explain what that actually means) and has promised big changes at the club. They might include the introduction of non-Basque Spaniards for the first time, but Benjamin insists that the heart of the side's going to remain Basque: \"80% of the team is a good figure\" he said. </p> <p>\"I'm going to mould this club the way I want it\", JB warned this week, \"and if I have to piss people off who I consider my friends, so be it - la Real mustn't be just any old team\". They'll soon be not just any old second division team if things don't improve. Despite an impressive 1-1 draw in Mallorca this weekend, JB's hard-man status, and his comic turns at press conferences, la Real are still bottom.</p> <p>Back in the real world, it's looking increasingly like three from four down the bottom. Oviedo (3-3 with Alav\u00e9s) and Valladolid (3-1 at home to Rayo Vallecano) are not totally safe but now stand five points clear of Numancia and Osasuna, who beat Bilbao 1-0 in the last minute. These two are anxiously looking over their shoulders - Racing Santander and Real Sociedad are just one point behind.</p> <p><strong>Spain make a meal of minnows</strong></p> <p>The clich\u00e9 'there's no easy games anymore' is surely a lie - after all, Bar\u00e7a, Depor and Celta scored four this weekend, and last weekend Spain went one better. Not that it was enough, though - it was against Liechtenstein, after all. Marca had run a poll in which over 85%, bless 'em (better still, lock 'em up), thought Camacho's men would get more than 11. Even the squad was confident - they ran a sweepstake before the match and the most pessimistic player went for six. </p> <p>Five might not be that great but Fernando Hierro certainly enjoyed himself - he scored a penalty to become Spain's all-time joint top goalscorer, thanks to that lovely man Gaizka Mendieta. Since Ra\u00fal bottled it, Mendieta has taken Spain's spot kicks, but this time he passed that honour to Hierro. The captain was touched, scored and told the press: \"I want to thank Mendieta publicly\". </p> <p>Of course, playing France is genuinely no easy game. Miraculously, after defeats against Argentina, Holland, Germany and England, Spain on Wednesday inflicted Les Bleus' first defeat (2-1) since becoming European champions. </p> <p>Iv\u00e1n Helguera headed the first and Fernando Morientes cooly finished a superb move for the second. It was all to much for the poor French to take - they decided they might as well kick the Spaniards about a bit if they weren't going to win. Marcel Desailly, Patrick Viera (surprise, surprise) and the normally placid (i.e. not-arsed) Christian Karembeu all got involved. </p> <p>Not that Spain didn't give as good as they got: Ra\u00fal was unusually animated and went round kicking, pushing and berating everyone in sight. Tragically, try as they might, a full-scale punch up never quite materialised. </p> <p>Fans may have missed out in Valencia, but it was a different story in Seville during a \"friendly\" (ha!) between Sevilla and Norwegian side Stabaek. It all started when Martin Andresen decided to show off the skills perfected during his Wimbledon days and launched (and I mean launched) a shocking Kung-fu challenge on Sevilla's Inti Podest\u00e1. Not a wise move just in front of the Sevilla bench and before he knew it, Andresen was set upon by four, six, or eight of Sevilla's subs (depending on who you believe) plus some of their fans. Cue mass brawl and uncontrollable laughter. </p> <p>\"I've never experienced anything like it,\" said Stabaek's Jan Aage Fjortoft, while Sevilla captain, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Prieto claimed that \"the Norwegian team thought it was a martial arts competition\". </p> <p>Now, as a pillar of the community this column can't possibly condone such ugly scenes, but it was pretty funny. Even if the Sevilla president, Roberto Al\u00e9s - sniffing a Federaci\u00f3n fine in the air - did claim \"it was nothing serious, just a scuffle between two teams and their benches [er, and their fans]. Nothing really happened - just four pushes and four charges\". No problem, then.</p> <p>Meanwhile another man under attack this week was Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda Aranda, the referee who infamously took charge of the Liverpool-Roma clash. He produced another top quality performance in mid-week at a World Cup qualifier between Uruguay and Paraguay. So good, in fact, that United Airlines staff had to hide him in their office when 500 fans spotted him at Montevideo airport and decided to give him a send-off he'd never forget. </p> <p>A security guard was struck by a rock, but the Kop's favourite ref escaped unscathed as he took charge at the Nou Camp this weekend. Whether Liverpool will return similarly unscathed from their visit on Thursday is another matter.</p> <p>Email Sid Lowe at <a href=\"mailto:spanishfootball@hotmail.com\">spanishfootball@hotmail.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The captain was touched, scored and told the press: \"I want to thank Mendieta publicly\". Of course, playing France is genuinely no easy game. Miraculously, after defeats against Argentina, Holland, Germany and England, Spain on Wednesday inflicted Les Bleus' first defeat (2-1) since becoming European champions. Iv\u00e1n Helguera headed the first and Fernando Morientes cooly finished a superb move for the second. It was all to much for the poor French to take - they decided they might as well kick the Spaniards about a bit if they weren't going to win. Marcel Desailly, Patrick Viera (surprise, surprise) and the normally placid (i.e. not-arsed) Christian Karembeu all got involved. Not that Spain didn't give as good as they got: Ra\u00fal was unusually animated and went round kicking, pushing and berating everyone in sight. Tragically, try as they might, a full-scale punch up never quite materialised. Fans may have missed out in Valencia, but it was a different story in Seville during a \"friendly\" (ha!) between Sevilla and Norwegian side Stabaek. It all started when Martin Andresen decided to show off the skills perfected during his Wimbledon days and launched (and I mean launched) a shocking Kung-fu challenge on Sevilla's Inti Podest\u00e1. Not a wise move just in front of the Sevilla bench and before he knew it, Andresen was set upon by four, six, or eight of Sevilla's subs (depending on who you believe) plus some of their fans. Cue mass brawl and uncontrollable laughter. \"I've never experienced anything like it,\" said Stabaek's Jan Aage Fjortoft, while Sevilla captain, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Prieto claimed that \"the Norwegian team thought it was a martial arts competition\". Now, as a pillar of the community this column can't possibly condone such ugly scenes, but it was pretty funny. Even if the Sevilla president, Roberto Al\u00e9s - sniffing a Federaci\u00f3n fine in the air - did claim \"it was nothing serious, just a scuffle between two teams and their benches [er, and their fans]. Nothing really happened - just four pushes and four charges\". No problem, then. Meanwhile another man under attack this week was Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda Aranda, the referee who infamously took charge of the Liverpool-Roma clash. He produced another top quality performance in mid-week at a World Cup qualifier between Uruguay and Paraguay. So good, in fact, that United Airlines staff had to hide him in their office when 500 fans spotted him at Montevideo airport and decided to give him a send-off he'd never forget. A security guard was struck by a rock, but the Kop's favourite ref escaped unscathed as he took charge at the Nou Camp this weekend. Whether Liverpool will return similarly unscathed from their visit on Thursday is another matter. Email Sid Lowe at spanishfootball@hotmail.com \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Bradford, meanwhile, are sufficiently happy with the way their team is performing that even Benito Carbone, who delighted and distressed in equal measure with his constant trickery, may now stay. \"The chairman's said that it's not beyond the realms of possibility that we can keep him,\" said the Bradford manager Jim Jefferies. \"He can see what we're trying to do, and I think he wants to be part of it.\" With season ticket applications over 50% down on this point last year, Bradford must hope that the fans do too - though if the rest of their season is as entertaining as this, that should be the least of their problems. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "byline": "Daniel Taylor  at Anfield",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>After the most anaemic title race since the Premiership's formation, the prospect of new blood is an enticing one. In the evolution of G\u00e9rard Houllier's Liverpool team, this performance represented a new tier of excellence, compelling evidence that, if Manchester United's omnipotence is to be challenged next season, the most durable challenge will emanate from Anfield. </p> <p>There are still questions to be asked. How, for example, can new Liverpool bludgeon United into the realms of mediocrity yet take only one point from their previous league fixtures against Leicester and Derby? Consistency remains a characteristic of Sir Alex Ferguson's men that Houllier can only envy. </p> <p>If the restoration job is to be concluded, the Frenchman will have to find more answers.

      "bodyText": "After the most anaemic title race since the Premiership's formation, the prospect of new blood is an enticing one. In the evolution of G\u00e9rard Houllier's Liverpool team, this performance represented a new tier of excellence, compelling evidence that, if Manchester United's omnipotence is to be challenged next season, the most durable challenge will emanate from Anfield. There are still questions to be asked. How, for example, can new Liverpool bludgeon United into the realms of mediocrity yet take only one point from their previous league fixtures against Leicester and Derby? Consistency remains a characteristic of Sir Alex Ferguson's men that Houllier can only envy. If the restoration job is to be concluded, the Frenchman will have to find more answers. But there are the first tantalising signs that even if United are favourites to retain the title next season, Liverpool may just ensure that Ferguson's final year is not the last hurrah everyone expects. Meanwhile, when the story of Manchester United's seventh title in nine seasons is penned, the concession of a first league double to Liverpool since 1979 will merit little more than small print. But for all the haughty references to more pressing engagements, the plethora of players rested ahead of tomorrow's Champions League appointment with Bayern Munich - \"maybe our season starts then,\" Ferguson volunteered - and the defiant statements that the damage was only superficial, there was no disguising that Saturday will have hurt. For United to treat possession with such wanton disregard was an oddity in itself, but to be out-hustled as well as out-manoeuvred is a matter worthy of more serious contemplation. In front of Bayern's scout Alexander Weiss, they had the chance to send out the right signals and failed. By stark contrast Liverpool will approach Thursday's Uefa Cup quarter-final in Barcelona with chests swelling from the best kind of psychological preparation. The Nou Camp can be a bear pit for travelling sides, but if Houllier's players can reproduce this sort of performance (and Steven Gerrard is fit) they need not feel any sense of inferiority complex. Not for the first time, and probably not the last, Gerrard was the driving influence of this Liverpool triumph, an indomitable presence on the right of midfield. His 16th-minute haymaker, a sure-fire contender for goal of the season, was an object lesson how to strike a long shot and watching him dominate Roy Keane et al just confirmed that Liverpool have a future England captain on their payroll. Possibly, even, this season's player of the year. By the time Robbie Fowler scored four minutes before the interval, capitalising on Gary Neville's slip to finish beautifully from Gerrard's cross, Liverpool were looking so dangerous, so in control, it was tempting to believe it was all a trick of the mind. Even after Danny Murphy had procured a second yellow card for raking his studs along Denis Irwin's calves on 69 minutes, having been booked for an earlier indiscretion against Nicky Butt, United's forays into home territory were predominantly of the limp-wristed variety.

She admitted that her husband might not have been wise to visit Ms Fish at her home and may have let her become too close. She said he did not deny that he had kissed her. A biographer of Keats and Larkin, Motion was appointed professor of creative writing at East Anglia in 1995. Ms Fish is working on a book about harassment.",

Pursuing Michael Schumacher down the curved pit straight, Coulthard took the lead with an inspired dive down the inside as the two men ran either side of Tarso Marques's Minardi. From then on, nothing stood between him and his 10th grand prix victory - bringing to an end Schumacher's run of six consecutive wins. </p> <p>The other star of the race was the Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, who confirmed his status as the most exciting new formula one driver to emerge in a decade yesterday by romping away into the early lead of the race, having elbowed his way ahead of Michael Schumacher's Ferrari in a dazzling display of car control in only his third outing for the BMW-Williams team. </p> <p>But just as it seemed he had gained the upper hand over the three times world champion, Montoya was shunted dramatically out of the race when Jos Verstappen's Arrows, which the Colombian had just lapped, slammed into the back of his Williams. The two cars pirouetted to a halt, but Montoya was cheered to the echo as he walked back to the pits, leaving Schumacher to fend off an increasingly determined Coulthard. </p> <p>Before the race, the Scot had opted for a \"compromise\" chassis setting which enabled him to make better use of the intermediate tyres than Michael Schumacher, whose car was on full dry settings. The German, who like Coulthard put on the Bridgestone intermediates during his second pitstop - having used them to such good effect a fortnight ago when he won the Malaysian grand prix - now found them working against him. </p> <p>As a result, spectators were treated to the uncharacteristic sight of Schumacher half-spinning and then sliding off the circuit as he struggled to keep touch with the McLaren, eventually dropping to second place some 16.1sec behind Coulthard at the chequered flag. The result strengthened Coulthard's credibility as a serious world championship contender with 20 points, only six behind Schumacher. </p> <p>On a day when mere survival was difficult on the treacherous track surface, the German Nick Heidfeld drove magnificently to take his Sauber-Ferrari across the line in third place, ahead of Olivier Panis's BAR-Honda. Jarno Trulli's Jordan-Honda and Giancarlo Fisichella's Benetton-Renault completed the top half-dozen. </p> <p>Even before the cars had taken their place on the starting grid, a collective groan had come from the passionately enthusiastic crowd as their hero Rubens Barrichello rolled to a standstill when his Ferrari's oil pressure plummeted on his first lap out of the pits. </p> <p>This was the latest in a long line of frustrations for the Sao Paulo driver, who had suffered an engine failure on Friday and then grappled with understeer throughout qualifying, and was only able to claim a disappointing sixth on the starting grid. </p> <p>In sweltering temperatures of around 35C (95F), Barrichello jogged back to the pits where he slumped exhausted on the floor while the Ferrari mechanics busied themselves changing the settings on Michael Schumacher's spare car, so the local hero could take up his position for the start. </p> <p>The task of changing pedal settings, adjusting his seat harness and fitting him into the car meant it was touch and go whether Barrichello would manage to get out on to the circuit before the pit lane exit closed 15 minutes prior to the start. In the event he made it with 26 seconds to spare, but it had been an uncomfortably close call. </p> <p>If this was a shaky moment for the Ferrari team, nothing compared with the crushing disappointment waiting for the McLaren-Mercedes team when Mika Hakkinen stalled on the grid. As Michael Schumacher led away from pole position, the pack scattered in all directions to avoid the stationary McLaren, and the dejected Finn climbed from the cockpit and walked back to his pit as the safety car was brought out to slow the field. </p> <p>At the end of the second lap the car was withdrawn again and, as a first rain shower doused the circuit, Montoya seized his chance to lunge down the inside of Schumacher going into the first turn. </p> <p>Not in the least intimidated by Schumacher's celebrity status, the Colombian ruthlessly banged wheels with the Ferrari team leader as he forced his way ahead. On the same lap the hapless Barrichello's bruising weekend ended when he slammed into the back of Ralf Schumacher's Williams-BMW under-braking at the end of the long straight beyond the pits.

      "body": "<p><strong>HOW LOWE CAN YOU GO?</strong></p> <p>Threats! Confusion! Talk of legal action! No, we're not talking about the Fiver's crazy weekend - although my, was it a close run thing - but the continued wrangling over Glenn Hoddle's move to his spiritual home [i.e. Spurs, not Eileen Drewery's semi in Basildon]. Day six of the saga - think North and South without the large bosoms - started with Spurs making a statement to the Stock Exchange, as the club is required to by City regulations, in which it confirmed that Hod and John Gorman had joined the club. </p> <p>Confusion then reigned. Heavily. First Spurs got a little mixed up over whether they'd even released a statement (\"It didn't come from us\", a spokesbloke told the Fiver). Then Saints chairman Rupert Lowe threatened - not for the first time - to stop Hod starting his new job. \"There is quite a list of requirements on a legal document that have to be agreed,\" he said, underlining each and every one of them with a yellow marker. \"As I hold Glenn's registration, I insist they be met before he takes over at the club.\"</p> <p>As a result, when Spurs' born-again saviour arrived at Tottenham's Chigwell training ground this morning, he had to find something else to do (which isn't easy in Chigwell, especially when you're a man of God). Not only that, but he couldn't even meet half the first team because they were out injured, and the reserves had already left for a match in Leicester. \"It is frustrating,\" seethed Hod-kick John Gorman. \"The sooner we get this situation sorted out the better so we can get on with the big job we face in the FA Cup semi-final.\" And the big job you face turning a mediocre team around too, the Fiver might add.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE MANC OF ENGLAND</strong></p> <p>By common consent, Manchester United are now washed up. Following that 2-0 defeat at Anfield, every true football fan knows that United will be lucky to avoid relegation next season and that Roy Keane is rubbish. But speak to a man in a suit (that's a combination of trousers, jacket, tie, and shirt, often in complimentary colours) and they'll tell you that United are set to reign for some time yet, and all thanks to these little paper things called 'money'.</p> <p>Man Utd plc today announced its financial results for the last six months and they read: Profit 1 - Loss 0 and Hope 0 - Despair 16. Up until January 31, United clocked up a turnover of \u00a372m, an increase of 13% on the previous year. Profits went up too, and the club made a record operating profit of \u00a321.4m (roughly half the amount David Beckham will earn from wearing clothes over the next year). Turnstile receipts were also up 33%, although singing was slashed by 64.9%.</p> <p>Of course, the Fiver couldn't tell the true meaning of these figures from a hole in the ground. In fact, it has trouble distinguishing holes in the ground full stop. But it is probably safe to infer that more money means more expansion, more players, and more trophies. Unless United's nearest rivals can compete with them in the financial sphere then true competition will be difficult to achieve. Which is why Robbie Fowler and Steven Gerrard are pulling stockings over their heads and heading for the nearest Bradford and Bingley as we speak.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"To tell the truth I just went up into the penalty area to create a bit of chaos but the corner was too inviting and I just stuck it in the net with all my anger.\" Former United howler Massimo Taibi celebrates scoring for his club Reggina yesterday. Wonder where all that anger came from?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>CHEER UP, IT'S EUROPE!</strong></p> <p>Permanently gagging on the stench of rotting cattle? Election postponement made you question the judgment of top newspaper the Sun? Been invited round Michael Barrymore's for a party? Hey, don't let it get you down, cos this week is Euroweek, and there's gonna be thrills galore!</p> <p>For starters, there's Herr Controversial, Bayern Munich striker Elber. Not content with calling Arsenal \"the worst team that I have ever seen ever. They are so bad that I'm going to puke right now. Bleeuurrgh\"*, the Brazilian has now laid into sexy Dave Beckham before tomorrow's Big Cup quarter-final clash. \"To my eyes he is no way a world class player,\" Elber mind-gamed on his personal web-thing. \"Okay, he can cross the ball well, but apart from that he's nothing special,\" he went on, giving Ottmar Hitzfeld a cheeky wink.</p> <p>But try as he might, Elber is not the only gob in football. Deportivo midfielder Victor has had a pop ahead of his side's match with Leeds, saying: \"We were very pleased when we drew Leeds. They are the weakest side in the competition.\" And Barcelona coach Lorenzo Serra Ferrer has encouraged his fans to come and watch his team lay on a \"fiesta of football\" against Liverpool on Thursday. </p> <p>Meanwhile Jaap Stam has done his part for the Brits and turned up the heat. He told his web-thing: \"I've been giving some thought to the foot-and-mouth crisis back home in Holland. It's a sickening sight to see so many animals being killed, especially the ones who don't have the disease yet.\" Take our word for it, this could be the most exciting Euroweek yet!</p> <p>*the exact wording may have been lost in translation.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Patrick Vieira will not be joining Juventus or anyone else, according to the Mirror. \"I've got four years left on my contract and I want to stay at Highbury,\" he said. \"I love Arsenal. The club is in my heart and leaving does not interest me.\"</p> <p>Rivaldo has confirmed that he will leave Barcelona, but not until 2003.

      "bodyText": "HOW LOWE CAN YOU GO? Threats! Confusion! Talk of legal action! No, we're not talking about the Fiver's crazy weekend - although my, was it a close run thing - but the continued wrangling over Glenn Hoddle's move to his spiritual home [i.e. Spurs, not Eileen Drewery's semi in Basildon]. Day six of the saga - think North and South without the large bosoms - started with Spurs making a statement to the Stock Exchange, as the club is required to by City regulations, in which it confirmed that Hod and John Gorman had joined the club. Confusion then reigned. Heavily. First Spurs got a little mixed up over whether they'd even released a statement (\"It didn't come from us\", a spokesbloke told the Fiver). Then Saints chairman Rupert Lowe threatened - not for the first time - to stop Hod starting his new job. \"There is quite a list of requirements on a legal document that have to be agreed,\" he said, underlining each and every one of them with a yellow marker. \"As I hold Glenn's registration, I insist they be met before he takes over at the club.\" As a result, when Spurs' born-again saviour arrived at Tottenham's Chigwell training ground this morning, he had to find something else to do (which isn't easy in Chigwell, especially when you're a man of God). Not only that, but he couldn't even meet half the first team because they were out injured, and the reserves had already left for a match in Leicester. \"It is frustrating,\" seethed Hod-kick John Gorman. \"The sooner we get this situation sorted out the better so we can get on with the big job we face in the FA Cup semi-final.\" And the big job you face turning a mediocre team around too, the Fiver might add. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE MANC OF ENGLAND By common consent, Manchester United are now washed up. Following that 2-0 defeat at Anfield, every true football fan knows that United will be lucky to avoid relegation next season and that Roy Keane is rubbish. But speak to a man in a suit (that's a combination of trousers, jacket, tie, and shirt, often in complimentary colours) and they'll tell you that United are set to reign for some time yet, and all thanks to these little paper things called 'money'. Man Utd plc today announced its financial results for the last six months and they read: Profit 1 - Loss 0 and Hope 0 - Despair 16. Up until January 31, United clocked up a turnover of \u00a372m, an increase of 13% on the previous year. Profits went up too, and the club made a record operating profit of \u00a321.4m (roughly half the amount David Beckham will earn from wearing clothes over the next year). Turnstile receipts were also up 33%, although singing was slashed by 64.9%. Of course, the Fiver couldn't tell the true meaning of these figures from a hole in the ground. In fact, it has trouble distinguishing holes in the ground full stop. But it is probably safe to infer that more money means more expansion, more players, and more trophies. Unless United's nearest rivals can compete with them in the financial sphere then true competition will be difficult to achieve. Which is why Robbie Fowler and Steven Gerrard are pulling stockings over their heads and heading for the nearest Bradford and Bingley as we speak. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"To tell the truth I just went up into the penalty area to create a bit of chaos but the corner was too inviting and I just stuck it in the net with all my anger.\" Former United howler Massimo Taibi celebrates scoring for his club Reggina yesterday. Wonder where all that anger came from? * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHEER UP, IT'S EUROPE! Permanently gagging on the stench of rotting cattle? Election postponement made you question the judgment of top newspaper the Sun? Been invited round Michael Barrymore's for a party? Hey, don't let it get you down, cos this week is Euroweek, and there's gonna be thrills galore! For starters, there's Herr Controversial, Bayern Munich striker Elber. Not content with calling Arsenal \"the worst team that I have ever seen ever. They are so bad that I'm going to puke right now. Bleeuurrgh\"*, the Brazilian has now laid into sexy Dave Beckham before tomorrow's Big Cup quarter-final clash. \"To my eyes he is no way a world class player,\" Elber mind-gamed on his personal web-thing. \"Okay, he can cross the ball well, but apart from that he's nothing special,\" he went on, giving Ottmar Hitzfeld a cheeky wink. But try as he might, Elber is not the only gob in football. Deportivo midfielder Victor has had a pop ahead of his side's match with Leeds, saying: \"We were very pleased when we drew Leeds. They are the weakest side in the competition.\" And Barcelona coach Lorenzo Serra Ferrer has encouraged his fans to come and watch his team lay on a \"fiesta of football\" against Liverpool on Thursday. Meanwhile Jaap Stam has done his part for the Brits and turned up the heat. He told his web-thing: \"I've been giving some thought to the foot-and-mouth crisis back home in Holland. It's a sickening sight to see so many animals being killed, especially the ones who don't have the disease yet.\" Take our word for it, this could be the most exciting Euroweek yet! *the exact wording may have been lost in translation. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Patrick Vieira will not be joining Juventus or anyone else, according to the Mirror. \"I've got four years left on my contract and I want to stay at Highbury,\" he said. \"I love Arsenal. The club is in my heart and leaving does not interest me.\" Rivaldo has confirmed that he will leave Barcelona, but not until 2003. Denying rumours that he was set to leave Catalonia this summer, Rivaldo said: \"The president has already said that he wants me to stay and I want to stay. But I will not be renewing my contract when it finishes in two seasons.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Teddy Sheringham may leave Manchester United this summer after only being offered a one-year contract as opposed to the two years he was hoping for. Dennis Bergkamp has been ruled out of Arsenal's Champions' League quarter-final first-leg against Valencia tomorrow because of an Achilles injury. Alan Smith could miss Leeds match against Deportivo La Coruna on Wednesday after picking up a calf injury at Sunderland at the weekend. Croatia forward Davor Suker has told reporters he has no intention of playing for West Ham again. \"If I play one more match, my contract would be automatically renewed - and I don't want that,\" he said. Manchester City chairman David Bernstein has promised that he will not sack Joe Royle if the team are relegated from the Premiership. QPR have confirmed that former director Andrew Ellis is considering launching a take-over of the club. The 32-year-old property developer is the son of the club's former chairman Peter, who was at the Loftus Road helm between 1994 and 1996. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Champions League weekly (11.30pm) Soccer heroes (Midnight) Football extra (12.30am) Channel 5: Dutch football (4.40am) Football League review (6.30pm) Live Monday night football - Southampton v Ipswich (7pm) You're on Sky Sports!

AOL Time Warner, Bertelsmann and EMI have joined forces with internet video and audio giant RealNetworks to create MusicNet. MusicNet will licence its service to companies seeking to sell music subscription services under their own brands, and could also end up doing a deal with Napster. Notable is the absence of Vivendi Universal and Sony Music, the other two major music companies, who last month got together to develop their own rival online music service, called Duet. EMI, Bertelsmann and AOL Time Warner will each own a minority stake in MusicNet and licence their music to the new service. RealNetworks, which also has a minority stake, will develop the internet media delivery technology. MusicNet will be a subscription-based service offering secure access to a catalogue of mainstream recordings, available either in streamed or downloadable format. While the industry applauded this new collaboration, opinion was guarded because of the lack of coherent business and revenue models.

Mr Dizaei has told friends he had no idea who Sanchez was, and can only think he was at a function with him. He says that Sanchez was later ruled out of the murder inquiry. In October 2000, without authority and in full uniform, you spoke to an Iranian business meeting in Los Angeles. Mr Dizaei accepted he spoke there, but does not believe wearing his uniform broke any rules.

      "body": "<p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, today postponed local elections until June 7 in order to give the government time to bring foot and mouth disease under control - but he made no announcement about the general election.</p> <p>Describing the decision to move the local elections back from May 3 as a \"need to balance competing interests\", Mr Blair said that an indefinite postponement would be \"highly damaging to the national interest\", as industries such as tourism would continue to suffer from an atmosphere of uncertainty.</p> <p>Last week church leaders called for the election to be put back to the autumn while the Tory leader, William Hague, said that holding an election while the foot and mouth crisis was raging would put \"party above country\". But speaking at Downing Street today, Mr Blair dismissed those calls.</p> <p>\"It is right that while we're putting in the mechanisms to fight this disease we have this postponement,\" he said. \"But in addition to the farming community I must listen to the tourist industry and the wider community.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Tony Blair, today postponed local elections until June 7 in order to give the government time to bring foot and mouth disease under control - but he made no announcement about the general election. Describing the decision to move the local elections back from May 3 as a \"need to balance competing interests\", Mr Blair said that an indefinite postponement would be \"highly damaging to the national interest\", as industries such as tourism would continue to suffer from an atmosphere of uncertainty. Last week church leaders called for the election to be put back to the autumn while the Tory leader, William Hague, said that holding an election while the foot and mouth crisis was raging would put \"party above country\". But speaking at Downing Street today, Mr Blair dismissed those calls. \"It is right that while we're putting in the mechanisms to fight this disease we have this postponement,\" he said. \"But in addition to the farming community I must listen to the tourist industry and the wider community. They will accept the delay I have set out but will not accept an indefinite postponement.\" John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB union, said: \"In the circumstances this is a responsible decision, but it is vital that the prime minister draws a line in the sand for June 7. If we were to be forced beyond that date it would be disastrous for tourism and the economy as a whole.\" Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said he would have preferred a May election, but he recognised that pressure had built up for a delay. \"The prime minister was in a no-win situation and I have a lot of sympathy for the position he was in,\" he said. Though Mr Blair refused to be drawn on the timing of a general election, his original preferred date of May 3 now seems an impossible target. Addressing the media at Conservative central office earlier today, Mr Hague argued against setting a new date for the local elections. Mr Hague said: \"If - as seems likely, and has been leaked by the government - elections cannot take place while this crisis continues, then we would accept that. But, since they cannot possibly know when the crisis will end, in our view it would not be possible to set any new precise date for these elections to be held.\" Asked if the Tories would oppose the legislation needed to postpone the local elections, Mr Hague replied: \"While we would accept legislation in principle, postponing the elections, we would not be in favour of a new particular date being set for those elections at this moment until the crisis is resolved.\" This afternoon the home secretary, Jack Straw, confirmed that emergency legislation will be introduced to postpone the local elections until June 7. Mr Straw told the Commons that the government had responded to the \"feelings and sensitivities of people\" in the communities most severely hit by foot and mouth. He said elections to 34 English county councils and 11 English unitary authorities had been scheduled for May 3, with elections for 26 district councils in Northern Ireland due on May 16. But he added: \"The House will, however, be aware of the considerable scale of representations which we have received to defer these elections because of the extent of foot and mouth disease.\" Amid rowdy scenes, the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, accused ministers of \"dither and delay\", but welcomed the government's \"belated recognition\" of the crisis in the countryside.

      "body": "<p>In the nine weeks remaining between now and the likely date of the general election, it is William Hague's job to remain publicly committed to the idea that the Conservatives can pull off a shock victory.</p> <p>Inside Conservative central office, however, speculation centres as much on the scale of the party's coming defeat and whether it will prove so crushing that Mr Hague finds himself the shortest-lived Tory leader since Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Few insiders expect the delay in the election to make much of a difference to the result.</p> <p>Yet it might. The Conservative leader dreams fondly of repeating Ted Heath's shock win in the 1970 election. As polling day approached most opinion polls predicted Harold Wilson's Labour government would win with a comfortable majority; most Labour MPs were sure that they would win. But Ted Heath to pull off a famous victory, with an overall majority of 30.</p> <p>What chance a repeat on June 7 2001? One crucial difference lies in the polls. Mr Wilson lost his opinion poll lead within a year of the 1966 election. His claim that Labour was the \"natural party of government\" was repeatedly battered by byelection losses and Gallup polls that showed the Tories lead averaging 18 points through 1968 and 15 points in 1969.</p> <p>With hindsight it is clear that the \"shock result\" would actually have been a Labour win, rather than the modest Tory victory that William Hague hopes to emulate.</p> <p>So what does the long-term trend in the polls tell us about what might happen in this election?</p> <p>First, it is well to remember what a historic victory the 1997 landslide actually was. Labour won by 13 points, with 44% of the vote, compared with the Tories' 31% and the Liberal Democrats' 17%.</p> <p>Some 31m people voted, a turnout of 71% of the registered electors. It was enough to give Tony Blair a 179-seat majority as he led the first Labour government for 18 years.</p> <p>Since then Labour has registered unprecedented poll leads. The Guardian/ICM poll recorded an average Labour lead of between nine and 19 points over the last three years.</p> <p>In polls that are even more favourable to the government, the Telegraph/Gallup has put Labour ahead for the past year by, on average, 15 points while the Times/Mori poll has had the party ahead by 16 points.</p> <p>The only blip came last September, during the petrol crisis. Despite this, the government swiftly rebuilt its lead in the polls.</p> <p>From a Conservative point of view, the last four years have seen the party floundering. They struggled in the immediate aftermath of the Blair victory and hit rock bottom at 23% in October 1997, before recovering a measure of dignity in early 1998, when they clawed their way back to 30% in the polls. Here they stayed for most of 1998 and 1999, during two years of what was termed \"flatlining\".</p> <p>Last summer saw a further modest advance for Mr Hague as Tony Blair admitted in a leaked memo that the government was widely perceived to be \"somehow out of touch with gut British instincts\" on key populist issues such as crime and asylum seekers.</p> <p>The Tory share of the vote went up to the 34/35% level on the ICM, where it has remained in a further bout of \"flatlining\", albeit at a higher level.</p> <p>If the Liberal Democrats share of the vote stays at its current 16/17-point level, it can be expected that a nine-point lead for Labour would translate into a 140-seat majority.</p> <p>Mr Hague must hope that he can squeeze the Labour lead during the campaign, which is why Labour want to keep it as short as possible. However, if he is to survive as Tory leader then he surely must cut Labour's majority to below 100 seats. In crude terms that will mean lowering Labour's lead below 5 points.</p> <p>In part William Hague's survival will depend on the turnout, and whether there is an electoral price to be paid by calling the general election in the middle of the foot and mouth epidemic.</p> <p>Recent polls have supported the argument that the reluctance of core Labour voters to get to the polling booths is greatest in its heartland seats, where it already has piled up big majorities.</p> <p>An ICM/News of the World poll showed that Labour's vote in 139 key marginals has actually gone up by 3.9% since May 1997. In the same seats, the Tories have only made a gain of 0.9%.</p> <p>The implication is that Mr Blair could win big again on June 7, perhaps with a majority of over 100, even if the turnout is very low. In fact, it is possible that the bigger the turnout, the bigger the Labour majority.</p> <p>The scale of tactical voting in individual seats is expected to be less developed than in 1997, but for many voters Mr Hague is even less attractive than John Major was in 1997.</p> <p>Perhaps for Mr Hague the more apt comparison is not 1970 but Mrs Thatcher's 1987 victory. Then the government party was re-elected with 42% of the vote against Labour's 31%.</p> <p>Mrs Thatcher's majority was cut to 101, a net loss of 21 seats. Those figures do not look too far out of line with what the polls have been telling us about Mr Blair's chances for the past four years.</p> <p>The Labour party gave Neil Kinnock the benefit of the doubt in the aftermath of their 1987 general election defeat. It would be no surprise were the Conservatives to do the same with William Hague.</p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br><a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/\">Election 2001</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/story/0,9029,467206,00.html\">02.04.2001: Blair delays elections</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/story/0,9029,467005,00.html\">02.04.2001: Emergency law to delay election</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/story/0,9029,467017,00.html\">02.04.2001, Michael White: With apologies to the sheep, it should have been May</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/story/0,9029,467353,00.html\">02.04.2001: The election decision: reaction in quotes</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/comment/0,9407,467152,00.html\">02.04.2001: The Tories must show the country what they have learnt</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,9061,465635,00.html\">02.04.2001: Religious leaders call for election delay</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">10 Downing Street</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/elections/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Home Office information for voters</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Labour party</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/\" target=\"_new\">Conservative party</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.greenparty.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Green party</a><br></p>",

Few insiders expect the delay in the election to make much of a difference to the result. Yet it might. The Conservative leader dreams fondly of repeating Ted Heath's shock win in the 1970 election. As polling day approached most opinion polls predicted Harold Wilson's Labour government would win with a comfortable majority; most Labour MPs were sure that they would win. But Ted Heath to pull off a famous victory, with an overall majority of 30. What chance a repeat on June 7 2001? One crucial difference lies in the polls. Mr Wilson lost his opinion poll lead within a year of the 1966 election. His claim that Labour was the \"natural party of government\" was repeatedly battered by byelection losses and Gallup polls that showed the Tories lead averaging 18 points through 1968 and 15 points in 1969. With hindsight it is clear that the \"shock result\" would actually have been a Labour win, rather than the modest Tory victory that William Hague hopes to emulate. So what does the long-term trend in the polls tell us about what might happen in this election? First, it is well to remember what a historic victory the 1997 landslide actually was. Labour won by 13 points, with 44% of the vote, compared with the Tories' 31% and the Liberal Democrats' 17%. Some 31m people voted, a turnout of 71% of the registered electors. It was enough to give Tony Blair a 179-seat majority as he led the first Labour government for 18 years. Since then Labour has registered unprecedented poll leads. The Guardian/ICM poll recorded an average Labour lead of between nine and 19 points over the last three years. In polls that are even more favourable to the government, the Telegraph/Gallup has put Labour ahead for the past year by, on average, 15 points while the Times/Mori poll has had the party ahead by 16 points. The only blip came last September, during the petrol crisis. Despite this, the government swiftly rebuilt its lead in the polls. From a Conservative point of view, the last four years have seen the party floundering. They struggled in the immediate aftermath of the Blair victory and hit rock bottom at 23% in October 1997, before recovering a measure of dignity in early 1998, when they clawed their way back to 30% in the polls. Here they stayed for most of 1998 and 1999, during two years of what was termed \"flatlining\". Last summer saw a further modest advance for Mr Hague as Tony Blair admitted in a leaked memo that the government was widely perceived to be \"somehow out of touch with gut British instincts\" on key populist issues such as crime and asylum seekers. The Tory share of the vote went up to the 34/35% level on the ICM, where it has remained in a further bout of \"flatlining\", albeit at a higher level. If the Liberal Democrats share of the vote stays at its current 16/17-point level, it can be expected that a nine-point lead for Labour would translate into a 140-seat majority. Mr Hague must hope that he can squeeze the Labour lead during the campaign, which is why Labour want to keep it as short as possible. However, if he is to survive as Tory leader then he surely must cut Labour's majority to below 100 seats. In crude terms that will mean lowering Labour's lead below 5 points. In part William Hague's survival will depend on the turnout, and whether there is an electoral price to be paid by calling the general election in the middle of the foot and mouth epidemic. Recent polls have supported the argument that the reluctance of core Labour voters to get to the polling booths is greatest in its heartland seats, where it already has piled up big majorities. An ICM/News of the World poll showed that Labour's vote in 139 key marginals has actually gone up by 3.9% since May 1997. In the same seats, the Tories have only made a gain of 0.9%. The implication is that Mr Blair could win big again on June 7, perhaps with a majority of over 100, even if the turnout is very low. In fact, it is possible that the bigger the turnout, the bigger the Labour majority. The scale of tactical voting in individual seats is expected to be less developed than in 1997, but for many voters Mr Hague is even less attractive than John Major was in 1997. Perhaps for Mr Hague the more apt comparison is not 1970 but Mrs Thatcher's 1987 victory. Then the government party was re-elected with 42% of the vote against Labour's 31%. Mrs Thatcher's majority was cut to 101, a net loss of 21 seats. Those figures do not look too far out of line with what the polls have been telling us about Mr Blair's chances for the past four years. The Labour party gave Neil Kinnock the benefit of the doubt in the aftermath of their 1987 general election defeat. It would be no surprise were the Conservatives to do the same with William Hague.

He told the European media and entertainment summit in London that Independent Television Commission rules are frustrating the company by preventing ITV programmes from plugging the channel. \"We have a number of restrictions in terms of how ONdigital can be promoted by ITV programmes, so when they promote specific content they cannot refer to ONdigital,\" he said. \"We are looking at ways to overcome these constraints so that we draw people to free-to-air and pay-TV content.\" Under current ITC rules, Des Lynam can plug a Champions' League match on ITV2, but he cannot mention that it is on ONdigital. \"Rebranding is one of a range of options,\" added Mr Fyfe. Analysts have been pressing ONdigital to undergo a branding revamp because the name does not attract anywhere near the same public recognition as ITV. However, Mr Fyfe added that ONdigital had succeeded in establishing a foothold in the digital market, although it only has 1m subscribers compared with BSkyB's 4.7m. \"We are at the stage where 95% of the active population have heard of our brand and in retail stores we are achieving about 50% of pay-TV sales.

      "bodyText": "Son of God, the BBC's heavily publicised look at the life of Jesus Christ, proved that even a religious documentary can have popular appeal after pulling in 6m viewers on Sunday night. The three-part programme went some way to rescuing BBC1's troubled Sunday night line-up, securing a respectable 25% share of the viewing between 9.10pm and 10pm. This compares with viewing figures of around 4m and a 17% share for Human Face, the John Cleese-fronted documentary that Son of God replaced. The lead-in from Son of God gave a boost to the BBC's 10pm news broadcast, which secured 5.7m viewers. And the return of that bankable old favourite, Last of the Summer Wine, earlier in the evening helped the BBC to shrug off the Sunday evening doldrums, although ITV's peaktime line-up of Heartbeat and London's Burning still looks pretty invincible. But advance publicity failed to draw viewers to another documentary on Sunday night. Channel 4's Witness courted controversy with an hour-long look at the work of Laura Boyle, author of the anti-feminist self-help book the Surrendered Wife. But in spite of heavy media coverage of the book, the programme attracted just 1m viewers to give it a 4% share. On Saturday, BBC1 and ITV had a fairly even match with BBC1's Casualty attracting 7.5m viewers against 8.3m for ITV's Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. Later in the evening, BBC1's Parkinson and ITV's Midsomer Murders were neck and neck with 6.6m viewers each. And on Friday BBC1 secured 6.5m viewers with a re-run of the ever-popular Only Fools &amp; Horses, followed by the Weakest Link, which secured 5.5m. Channel 5's weekly figures were the second best since it launched four years ago. The coverage of the England World Cup football qualifier against Albania helped boost audience share levels for the week to 7.3%. And Sky TV is claiming a ratings success with all three of its Star Wars movies making it into its top three places in the film charts.",

It was a dramatic humiliation for a man who ruled for 13 years, turning Yugoslavia from a pillar of cold war independence into a pariah state with a crony capitalist economy and a huge fall in living standards for all but his friends. But as people across Serbia applauded the former Yugoslav president's pre-dawn arrest, the battle over his image continued with as much fury and contradiction as it had done when he was at large.

      "bodyText": "For at least the next 30 days Yugoslavia's former president Slobodan Milosevic will bide his time in Belgrade's central prison, listening to a slow trickle of accusations of venality and brutality during his 13 years in power. Mr Milosevic, who can be held for up to six months at the discretion of the investigating magistrates, and several key cronies face charges of abuse of power, embezzlement and siphoning off government assets and budget funds into the special accounts of favoured companies. All the alleged transgressions, prosecutors say, were aimed at keeping him and his socialist party in power. The Serbian police have released details of the charges against Mr Milosevic, confirming the Guardian's report on Thursday that the Yugoslav customs service was used by his regime to salt away hundreds of millions of pounds. Mihalj Kertes, the regime's customs chief, Nikola Sainovic, the former deputy prime minister, and Dusan Matkovic, a key Milosevic crony, are all implicated as conspirators in the alleged financial and embezzlement scams. Vladan Batic, the Serbian justice minister, said yesterday that parliament would have to agree to lift the immunity from prosecution which protects its MPs, as some of those accused with Mr Milosevic sit in parliament and can operate with impunity. Further charges against Mr Milosevic are expected, including the graver accusations of ordering political violence against his opponents and war crimes against his own people. For the moment, however, he could face a jail term of up to 15 years for corruption and abuse of office, the first offences to be laid at his door. The charge sheet reveals that Mr Milosevic and his fellow conspirators allegedly embezzled $400m (\u00a3282m) in state funds. \"It has been established that Milosevic, as president of Serbia and later Yugoslavia, committed a criminal deed of abuse of power with the aims of profiting financially and staying in power,\" Miodrag Vukovic, a senior detective, said. The indictment is not final: it is the product of the initial police investigation and has to be validated by the investigating magistrate, who will decide whether the prosecution should proceed. The prosecutors allege that Mr Milosevic deliberately oversaw the near destruction of the Serbian monetary system, intentionally promoting hyper-inflation and black market dealing in currency for political and private profit. In a scam that dates back to 1994, the indictment alleges, Mr Milosevic instructed Mr Kertes, the customs boss and a former secret police chief, to divert customs receipts to special accounts set up at Serbia's biggest bank, Beogradska Banka, which Mr Milosevic headed in the early 80s before his political career took off. The money was to go to certain state companies, state organisations and individuals decided by Mr Milosevic and his cohorts.

He is also said to be providing information on Mr Milosevic and deeply implicated in alleged assassination plots against Mr Milosevic's foes. Mr Sainovic, the former deputy prime minister who controlled Serbia's precious metals trade, has also been indicted by the Hague tribunal for war crimes in Kosovo. He has been questioned by Serbian police, but has claimed parliamentary immunity. Mr Matkovic was one of the key members of Mr Milosevic's socialist party and ran the big steel works at Smederovo, outside Belgrade. Both he and Mr Sainovic are said by regime insiders and diplomats to have private bank accounts in Lebanon. The indictment also alleges that Mr Sainovic was given a further \u00a380,000 in customs revenue later in 1996. \"All the money was paid in the office of Mihalj Kertes on the orders of Slobodan Milosevic.\" Although Mr Milosevic and Mr Sainovic have been indicted by the Hague tribunal, they are unlikely to be sent there soon.

A spokeswoman said reports that ATG had \"a programme-making alliance\" with ITV company Carlton were inaccurate. \"It does not make programmes at all,\" she said. \"Nor will it under this new deal with Carlton.\" She said the investment would be referred to the board of governors should there be any potential for a conflict of interest. However, as there was no conflict \"at this stage\", it would not be referred. Nevertheless, corporation insiders say the fact Mr Dyke has invested in ATG shows he may not have learned a lesson from the controversy surrounding his considerable investments last year. Carlton last week concluded a rights deal with ATG, which also has a joint venture with Natural Nylon, the production company owned by Jude Law, Sadie Frost and Ewan McGregor. Two of the first three plays to be produced by Natural Nylon are classics - Dr Faustus and Christopher Hampton's translation of Chekhov's Three Sisters. The third will be an adaptation of John Fowles's novel the Collector. The Carlton deal will give the two companies access to the rights to each other's programmes. The BBC spokeswoman said the deal was valuable to Carlton because it will enable it to use its extensive programming archive to develop stage plays. In a press statement, the BBC underlined the fact Mr Dyke made the board of governors aware of the investment when it was made last year, \"as is required\". There was no conflict of interest then, and there isn't know, a spokeswoman said. The statement continued: \"Mr Dyke plays no active role in ATG. He is not a director and has not attended any company meetings.

The BBC spokeswoman said Mr Gavin's investment was no secret and had been declared in the BBC's register of personal interests. Mr Dyke was forced to sell \u00a36m-worth of shares last year after it emerged he held a stake in Granada TV. He became a millionaire while he was the head of LWT, which was subsequently taken over by Granada. He also came under fire when it was revealed he had \u00a3275,000-worth of shares in Pearson Television after he was appointed director-general of the BBC. Mr Dyke sold the shares after facing public opprobium. Related stories Mar 15: BBC governors under fire Special report: the BBC",

      "bodyText": "The Sun was basking in glory today after Tony Blair confirmed \"wot the paper already knew\", announcing the general election was off for May 3. The prime minister said the national interest was best served by the postponement of the election, which is now likely to take place on June 7. It signals what will be start of a 10-week election battle - one of the longest in history. Today the Sun's political editor Trevor Kavanagh rebuffed suggestions the paper was given a special briefing before it revealed on Saturday morning that the May general election was off. But he has refused to deny the story came from either Tony Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell or his personal assistant Anji Hunter. He told MediaGuardian.co.uk: \"Nobody knows how I got the story. That is a matter for me and the person I spoke to.\" But he added: \"I'm not denying I had a conversation with anyone in order for people to narrow it down.\" The remarks follow claims from rival newspapers that Mr Kavanagh was given special treatment by Tony Blair's inner circle and media relations team because the Sun is considered pivotal to Labour's general election strategy. \"This is no way to run a democracy,\" said one furious newspaper executive. \"It is outrageous the Sun should know what date the election is going to be held before the rest of the cabinet is briefed. \"Even if the cabinet had been briefed, it was clear it was not briefed about Alastair Campbell's media strategy - to give an exclusive to the Sun.\" Mr Kavanagh's story caught several newspapers and members of Mr Blair's cabinet on the hop. On Saturday morning, culture secretary Chris Smith was left looking foolish when he went on the BBC's Today programme and failed to indicate he knew the election had been delayed. He remained \"on message\" and spoke of the need to avoid delay, suggesting he was not informed of the Sun's front-page splash declaring \"Election off\". And journalists on the Observer were furious not to have been briefed on the story, having printed an 80-page election booklet. The Daily Mail today claimed Mr Blair's office gave the Sun and the Times briefings ahead of the rest of the newspapers. The Sun today made it plain it believed it got the scoop simply because it is the paper that matters. Mr Kavanagh said: \"I think the story was there for anyone who wanted to find it.\" But many commentators said Labour had to give the paper the exclusive story because it had \"led it up the garden path\" a week earlier by providing it with another splash declaring May 3 was the election date. Labour believes the paper to be absolutely crucial in securing the support of swing voters. Three weeks ago, the party was relieved by the Sun's public backing of Mr Blair for a second term in government. Today the paper crows about its exclusive in its leader column. It revels in the fact the BBC's Frost programme on Sunday morning \"revealed\" to viewers the election had been postponed. In a triumphant leader, the Sun says it was obvious BBC political editor Andrew Marr had nipped down to the newsagent to pick up a copy of the Sun to learn the news. \"Once again, this paper has infuriated the political establishment by leading the way,\" it says.",

      "body": "<p>I'll get spat on in the street for saying it but, after Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan is far and away my favourite 007. The rest of them are so far behind these two that they are all but invisible (weirdly though, these days my top Bond movie is George Lazenby's On Her Majesty's Secret Service - the one with the saucy Simon Raven dialogue). Brosnan spent much of his early career circling around the Bond persona in pseudo-superspy fluff such as Remington Steele, as if in long-term training for his Licence To Kill. When Roger Moore retired, the Irishman - who knows it takes a Celt to give 007 his feral edge - pressed his own case strongly and publicly, and was vocally unhappy when Cubby Broccoli chose instead to take the fateful Timothy Dalton detour. </p> <p>After the franchisers wised up and offloaded Dalton, Brosnan made 007 his first priority. Not for him Roger Moore's biennial working vacations from his Swiss eyrie, or the gnawing sense that the stage-based Dalton was slumming in the role. Brosnan came aboard knowing he could revitalise the series, and seems to have done just that. Now that his stint is drawing to a close, he's laying down the basis for an interesting post-Bond career. Much as he shadow-boxed around Bond before he actually was Bond, now he's taking the 007 persona apart piece by piece in his non-007 projects. </p> <p>Last year he took a character with all Bond's primary characteristics - Thomas Crown - and infused him with sexual neuroses, identity crises and a deeply ambiguous personal morality. The result wasn't exactly a work of genius, but Brosnan was the producer and clearly he wasn't interested in staying within Bond's chalk outline of a character. </p> <p>Now, in John Boorman's clever, cheeky thriller The Tailor of Panama, Brosnan plays the evil, amoral spy Andy Osman, and he is having the time of his life. Tailor, based on John Le Carr\u00e9's novel (which in turn bears a slightly unhealthy resemblance to Graham Greene's Our Man In Havana, but no matter), knowingly tweaks the Bond/Brosnan connection. One of the first things we see is a picture of Connery on the schmutter-cutter's wall. </p> <p>\"He's a valued customer,\" says Geoffrey Rush. \"With a golfer's build!\" Then Connery's successor appears and the only thing he shakes or stirs up is shit, taking Rush's life apart the same way Peter Cook roasted, stuffed and ate Dudley Moore in Bedazzled. </p> <p>Bond's amiable \"sexist dinosaur\" is here a man who blurts out, \"Look at those fuckin' tits!\" and whose irrepressible sex-drive makes him more rapist than bedroom trampolinist. Brosnan presence is the movie's subversive little masterstroke, and we can forget those sneaking suspicions we may once have had about his thespian limitations. He's nasty! </p> <p>The shadow of 007 also fell, albeit a little less heavily, across the weekend's other interesting release, the bouncy children's comedy-thriller Spy Kids.

      "bodyText": "I'll get spat on in the street for saying it but, after Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan is far and away my favourite 007. The rest of them are so far behind these two that they are all but invisible (weirdly though, these days my top Bond movie is George Lazenby's On Her Majesty's Secret Service - the one with the saucy Simon Raven dialogue). Brosnan spent much of his early career circling around the Bond persona in pseudo-superspy fluff such as Remington Steele, as if in long-term training for his Licence To Kill. When Roger Moore retired, the Irishman - who knows it takes a Celt to give 007 his feral edge - pressed his own case strongly and publicly, and was vocally unhappy when Cubby Broccoli chose instead to take the fateful Timothy Dalton detour. After the franchisers wised up and offloaded Dalton, Brosnan made 007 his first priority. Not for him Roger Moore's biennial working vacations from his Swiss eyrie, or the gnawing sense that the stage-based Dalton was slumming in the role. Brosnan came aboard knowing he could revitalise the series, and seems to have done just that. Now that his stint is drawing to a close, he's laying down the basis for an interesting post-Bond career. Much as he shadow-boxed around Bond before he actually was Bond, now he's taking the 007 persona apart piece by piece in his non-007 projects. Last year he took a character with all Bond's primary characteristics - Thomas Crown - and infused him with sexual neuroses, identity crises and a deeply ambiguous personal morality. The result wasn't exactly a work of genius, but Brosnan was the producer and clearly he wasn't interested in staying within Bond's chalk outline of a character. Now, in John Boorman's clever, cheeky thriller The Tailor of Panama, Brosnan plays the evil, amoral spy Andy Osman, and he is having the time of his life. Tailor, based on John Le Carr\u00e9's novel (which in turn bears a slightly unhealthy resemblance to Graham Greene's Our Man In Havana, but no matter), knowingly tweaks the Bond/Brosnan connection. One of the first things we see is a picture of Connery on the schmutter-cutter's wall. \"He's a valued customer,\" says Geoffrey Rush. \"With a golfer's build!\" Then Connery's successor appears and the only thing he shakes or stirs up is shit, taking Rush's life apart the same way Peter Cook roasted, stuffed and ate Dudley Moore in Bedazzled. Bond's amiable \"sexist dinosaur\" is here a man who blurts out, \"Look at those fuckin' tits!\" and whose irrepressible sex-drive makes him more rapist than bedroom trampolinist. Brosnan presence is the movie's subversive little masterstroke, and we can forget those sneaking suspicions we may once have had about his thespian limitations. He's nasty! The shadow of 007 also fell, albeit a little less heavily, across the weekend's other interesting release, the bouncy children's comedy-thriller Spy Kids. It's directed by, of all people, Robert Rodriguez of El Mariachi fame, and it feels a little like a Tim Burton Bond movie - which, come to think of it, might be a fantastic idea. In Rodriguez's hands this story of two kids rescuing their superspy parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) from a host of evil supervillains has a magical silliness that keeps one eye on the adults who bought the tickets. The Spy Kids' suburban house throbs with secret-agent devices ranging from micro-cameras to explosive bubble-gum, and the villains' HQ is like something Ken Adam might have come up with after being locked in a cell with 10 tabs of acid and the collected works of Dr Seuss and R Crumb.

      "body": "<p>Mention the illness tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and most people won't know what you are talking about. Some might confuse it with tuberculosis or multiple sclerosis, but hardly anyone is aware of this harrowing genetic disorder.</p> <p>It may have a low public profile but TSC can wreck people's lives and lead to premature deaths. The Tuberous Sclerosis Association (TSA) was established in 1977 to raise the profile of this disease, to fund research and to offer practical support to sufferers and their families.</p> <p>TSC gets its name from the tumours that grow and harden anywhere in the body. These tumours can cause chronic physical, behavioural-learning and neurological problems. Epilepsy, brain tumours, autism, kidney and lung problems, heart tumours, hyperactivity and facial rashes are just some of the problems sufferers have to face.

      "bodyText": "Mention the illness tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and most people won't know what you are talking about. Some might confuse it with tuberculosis or multiple sclerosis, but hardly anyone is aware of this harrowing genetic disorder. It may have a low public profile but TSC can wreck people's lives and lead to premature deaths. The Tuberous Sclerosis Association (TSA) was established in 1977 to raise the profile of this disease, to fund research and to offer practical support to sufferers and their families. TSC gets its name from the tumours that grow and harden anywhere in the body. These tumours can cause chronic physical, behavioural-learning and neurological problems. Epilepsy, brain tumours, autism, kidney and lung problems, heart tumours, hyperactivity and facial rashes are just some of the problems sufferers have to face. Nothing can stop these tumours from developing. However, early diagnosis and monitoring can help to minimise the effects of the disease. The disease affects one in 6,000 people. There are around 8,500 cases in the UK and more than a million worldwide. Although it is a genetic disorder, 70% of cases are born to families with no medical history of TSC. Indeed, many parents do not know they carry the disease until it is too late. Even with only mild symptoms there is a 50% chance of passing TSC on to your children. This may make grim reading.

The TSA has earmarked \u00a3450,000 to fund this and other research. In the meantime it gets on with the more practical aspect of its work: offering care and support to sufferers. It does this in several ways: \u0095 Running a helpline that gives sufferers and their families invaluable information and support about TSC. \u0095 Employing a family care officer who helps sort out practical problems with education, social services and health care. \u0095 Administering a benevolent fund. This gives financial support for specialised toys and equipment. It also helps with travelling expenses so sufferers can visit specialist clinics. \u0095 Running activity weekends for younger sufferers.

      "bodyText": "Why are the local elections being delayed? Because the prime minister says so. After visiting farmers affected by the foot and mouth epidemic all last week, Mr Blair took the decision late on Friday to put off the local elections - and with them, the general election. It would be politically impossible to justify a general election campaign in areas where the local polls have been postponed. However, the decision was not made easier by the fact that tourism bosses were warning Mr Blair that the industry was losing up to \u00a3200m a week in cancelled bookings, Labour's Millbank machine had geared up for a May 3 date and the Sun had already declared the date on its front page. As recently as Friday the leader of the house, Margaret Beckett, was telling parliament that any delay in the local elections would send out the message that \"Britain was closed for business\". This is the first delay to local elections since the second world war. Where are these local elections? There are county council elections in 34 areas, including the worst hit foot and mouth areas of Labour-held Cumbria and Liberal Democrat-held Devon. These councils - which have major spending powers - are elected all in one go, and there are 2,203 seats up for grabs. At present, the Tories control 11, Labour eight, Liberal Democrats two and there is no overall control in 13. There are also 11 unitary councils holding elections, all (except in two cases) electing a third of their seats. Of the 11, seven are Labour-controlled, one Conservative and three where there is no overall control. Voters in these areas will be able to vote on the new date as usual. Traditionally, it is seen as an advantage to hold the general election on the same day as the local elections, as it boosts turnout, and Labour will be hoping to firm up its high 1997 local vote with the substantial push that a general election gives to a campaign. Why does Mr Blair not just announce now when the general election will be and get it over with? As soon as a date is set for polling in a general election, auditors start counting all election expenses. Under new rules from the electoral commission, the parties are capped at a limit of just under \u00a315m each, although this will rise slightly due to the postponement of a general election. In addition, ministers and MPs have strict curtailments of their roles imposed during an election campaign. Although ministers continue in their jobs, they cannot take decisions on matters arising beyond the election date, and MPs face restrictions on the use of their Commons offices. Virtually everybody assumes the local election dates are being used by Downing Street as a code for the general election, and Mr Blair has stated categorically they will be on June 7 - this is not an \"indefinite postponement\", he said. So when will a general election be called? The last and most likely date for the dissolution of parliament and the start of the election campaign proper is May 14 - although for most people it will feel like a rolling election campaign from here on in. What does this mean for the census? The nationwide census is going ahead as planned on April 29. Volunteers who deliver census forms have been told not to cross foot and mouth warning signs, whether they be official warnings from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, or placards posted by local farmers or land owners. Instead, census forms will be left at a central collection point in affected villages for personal collection, or sent out by post. The office for national statistics, which organises the census every decade, says it is not worried by the logistics of getting around the foot and mouth epidemic. It is important to update the census every ten years at the same time, as all Treasury projections of future spending are based on the information gleaned from census data.

So did the Labour MP who excitedly reported that he'd just seen General Sir Mike Jackson on TV - in camouflage and red beret - taking on all those unarmed cattle. </p> <p>\"That means it must be May 3,\" the MP explained. Until they read Saturday morning's Sun - New Labour's equivalent of the Official Gazette - most cabinet ministers thought so too, though those with long memories will remember that 10 days earlier the Sun had said with equally self-important certainty that it would not be June. The editor had virtually been to the Palace to tell the Queen. Equally unembarrassable, ministers have also been coming round fast since learning that the prime minister had changed his mind at the end of a week of intermittent wobbling. The party machine at Millbank - and in the constituencies - will be less easily placated. </p> <p>This was not an aircraft taxiing down the runway, only to be called back by air traffic control. The election plane was airborne somewhere over the Irish Sea when the drinks were spilled in first class and the peanuts scattered in economy on Friday night. The result: an emergency landing, burned rubber, money leaking like fuel, adrenalin gone to waste. And for what, activists and officials will be asking each other today when postponement of the county council elections obliquely confirms the larger delay. </p> <p>To appease the farmers who don't like Labour anyway ? To impress the Countryside Alliance and the editor of the Daily Telegraph, who don't vote for Blair either? To please the bishops whom Mrs Thatcher spent 11 largely-successful years taking no notice of whatsoever? </p> <p>I must admit I had a wobble myself long before Downing Street appeared to cotton on to just how grim things were in much of the countryside. It would obviously be logistically possible to stage the elections. Telephone canvassing, postal votes, Millbank had all the answers. But would it be appropriate amid so much rural distress? Or a bit like going to a party straight after granny's funeral? </p> <p>It did not take much to unwobble me. As the scale of the traffic in infected animals emerged from the agri-economy and the logistics of slaughter/burial/vaccination loomed ever larger, it became obvious that Britain will not be out of this crisis in a hurry. Certainly not by June 7, this year or next. </p> <p>To make matters worse it was, pre-Milosevic, a slow news month. As the story was spread around the world by our efficient (and hysterical) media, the growing damage to tourism - a far more important industry by any test - could only be compounded by delay. Americans already think our feet and hands are dropping off. </p> <p>So, delay will benefit no one and may add to the financial burdens in already hard-pressed regions. With lanes closed and hungry sheep on the Ridgeway, prosperous west Berkshire looked disease-free but quietly miserable yesterday. Cumbria - and it is mainly Cumbria - must be awful. But not many of us live or work there. Life goes on, except in Whitehall where the decision-making process, never hyperactive, remains grid-locked until the election is won or lost. </p> <p>There is also the question of will. If Mr Blair is seen in four weeks' time to have got on top of the crisis and earned well-deserved plaudits after an admittedly slow start, he may well claim to have \"put country before party\" and re-earned his laurels as a One Nation leader. A handsome second term majority will be his just reward. That is what cabinet loyalists say. \"Tony's great strength is his One Nation instinct,\" says one of the pro-June 7 minority. \"The decision will undermine the claims that Labour is anti-countryside. It will also make it awkward for William Hague to conduct an election campaign over the next 10 weeks after what he's said.\" </p> <p> That is the sort of upbeat spin I expect Alastair Campbell to put on events when he feeds the vultures at this morning's 11 o'clock briefing in the basement of No 10, albeit, I suspect, with more enthusiasm than he privately feels. Yet the same result could have been achieved by Blair devoting the first half of the campaign - until after Easter - to the rural crisis, leaving the vulgar electioneering to Gordon Brown. He would not have minded! </p> <p>As things stand, Blair-bashers, Ken Clarke for instance, will crow that the prime minister has again been pushed off course by his own lack of inner certainty and belief, or by his desire to be liked. \"The minute you say 'Why don't the electorate love us?' you're on the road to ruin,\" a senior No 10 adviser admitted recently. </p> <p>Quite. Yet the chancellor's March 7 budget quietly paid \u00a31.9bn worth of Danegeld to the road protest lobby, despite the No Surrender rhetoric. Sensible politics in the circumstances, and it was good to see the Daily Mail advocating European tax harmonisation on fuel duties. But, as with the fuel protest, Blair will today again look like a leader who is more concerned to appease his natural enemies than reward his friends, more concerned to listen to his unelected kitchen cabinet - Philip Gould, the Eeyore of pollsters, is likely to have had a hand in this - than to his elected cabinet colleagues. </p> <p>Delay must have irritated the Sun, but has it pleased the Daily Mail? We shall see. There remains the niggling doubt that this delay has something to do with our muddled sentimentality towards animals, whom we seem happy to battery-farm and kill in huge numbers provided no one reminds us what is happening. </p> <p>So, in these sentimental and credulous times, we weep for both lambs and foxes, but not for steel workers. And Mr Blair is a man of his time, more so perhaps than the rational Ken Clarke.</p>",

If Mr Blair is seen in four weeks' time to have got on top of the crisis and earned well-deserved plaudits after an admittedly slow start, he may well claim to have \"put country before party\" and re-earned his laurels as a One Nation leader. A handsome second term majority will be his just reward. That is what cabinet loyalists say. \"Tony's great strength is his One Nation instinct,\" says one of the pro-June 7 minority. \"The decision will undermine the claims that Labour is anti-countryside. It will also make it awkward for William Hague to conduct an election campaign over the next 10 weeks after what he's said.\" That is the sort of upbeat spin I expect Alastair Campbell to put on events when he feeds the vultures at this morning's 11 o'clock briefing in the basement of No 10, albeit, I suspect, with more enthusiasm than he privately feels. Yet the same result could have been achieved by Blair devoting the first half of the campaign - until after Easter - to the rural crisis, leaving the vulgar electioneering to Gordon Brown. He would not have minded! As things stand, Blair-bashers, Ken Clarke for instance, will crow that the prime minister has again been pushed off course by his own lack of inner certainty and belief, or by his desire to be liked. \"The minute you say 'Why don't the electorate love us?' you're on the road to ruin,\" a senior No 10 adviser admitted recently. Quite. Yet the chancellor's March 7 budget quietly paid \u00a31.9bn worth of Danegeld to the road protest lobby, despite the No Surrender rhetoric. Sensible politics in the circumstances, and it was good to see the Daily Mail advocating European tax harmonisation on fuel duties. But, as with the fuel protest, Blair will today again look like a leader who is more concerned to appease his natural enemies than reward his friends, more concerned to listen to his unelected kitchen cabinet - Philip Gould, the Eeyore of pollsters, is likely to have had a hand in this - than to his elected cabinet colleagues. Delay must have irritated the Sun, but has it pleased the Daily Mail? We shall see. There remains the niggling doubt that this delay has something to do with our muddled sentimentality towards animals, whom we seem happy to battery-farm and kill in huge numbers provided no one reminds us what is happening. So, in these sentimental and credulous times, we weep for both lambs and foxes, but not for steel workers. And Mr Blair is a man of his time, more so perhaps than the rational Ken Clarke.",

      "body": "<p>The prime minister today confirmed that the planned May 3 local elections will be delayed for a month while the government struggles to contain the spiralling foot and mouth crisis.</p> <p>Speaking outside Downing Street, Tony Blair said the delay was in the country's best interests, but rejected calls for an indefinite postponement of the council polls, which he said could cause even more harm to the tourism industry.</p> <p>Instead, the government plans to bring in emergency legislation that will move the council elections to June 7, effectively putting back the date of the general election, which was expected on the same day as the local vote.</p> <p>Mr Blair said the government's focus had to be on tackling the disease: \"Our task therefore, now, is to complete the putting in place of the short, medium and long-term strategies to ensure the eventual eradication of the disease. Whilst this is going on, I believe it would not be appropriate to hold these elections on the 3rd of May.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister today confirmed that the planned May 3 local elections will be delayed for a month while the government struggles to contain the spiralling foot and mouth crisis. Speaking outside Downing Street, Tony Blair said the delay was in the country's best interests, but rejected calls for an indefinite postponement of the council polls, which he said could cause even more harm to the tourism industry. Instead, the government plans to bring in emergency legislation that will move the council elections to June 7, effectively putting back the date of the general election, which was expected on the same day as the local vote. Mr Blair said the government's focus had to be on tackling the disease: \"Our task therefore, now, is to complete the putting in place of the short, medium and long-term strategies to ensure the eventual eradication of the disease. Whilst this is going on, I believe it would not be appropriate to hold these elections on the 3rd of May. But equally, we cannot, should not and will not indefinitely suspend the democratic process.\" The prime minister has come under pressure to delay from the Conservatives and some county council leaders. They argue that holding the elections while foot and mouth is still raging would block effective canvassing and disenfranchise rural voters trapped in their homes by movement restrictions designed to fight the spread of the disease. The government has, however, come in for cross-party criticism for setting such a short delay, and some Labour figures complained that the foot and mouth situation might not significantly improve by June, rendering the postponement pointless. Conservative leader William Hague said the prime minister was wrong to set the new date so soon: \"We just think it would not be possible or wise to set a precise date at this point when they don't know how the crisis will continue and when it will be resolved.\" The Tory leader also hinted that, although the party supported the principle of a delay, its total support for the government's emergency bill is not guaranteed: \"How we would handle a bill in detail depends on what form the bill would take.\" Labour's local government chief, Sir Jeremy Beecham, admitted that he would have preferred a May 3 date for both the local and general elections. Along with other senior Labour local government figures, he has in the past called for increased use of postal voting to allow isolated voters to take part in the polls. Councils would not, he said, find the delay practically difficult, but it would be inconvenient. Sir Jeremy said: \"I can understand the sensitivities that drove the prime minister to defer, but I'm not sure much will change in a month.\" Somerset county council leader Chris Clarke, a Liberal Democrat, added: \"It's very hard to know whether a month is long enough There's no way people in a rural area could have their minds clear enough to think about local elections with this hanging over them.\"",

The disease continued to affect sporting events with yesterday's decision to cancel the Cheltenham festival race meeting, which had been rearranged from March to later this month, after officials confirmed that it was within the foot and mouth exclusion zone. The meeting, which was postponed because of the livestock movement restrictions, was doomed after a new case was confirmed yesterday in Woolstone, a village five miles from the track. What happens now? April 2 Prime minister and home secretary to confirm local council elections will be held on June 7. April 3 Party managers will seek advice from the electoral commission on new spending limits. Expect to be told they can spend an extra \u00a3800,000 each. April 6 Class size and pupil teacher ratio figures released. April 15 Easter Sunday and teaching union conferences. April 26 New Deal figures released. May 14 Last date for dissolution of parliament. June 6 Monetary policy committee to give interest rate decision. June 7 General and county council elections.",

      "body": "<p>Punters in Australia flock to place dollars on every kind of race, whether it features dogs, horses, camels, cane toads, lizards or cockroaches.</p> <p>But they may not be able to bet on the internet for much longer. Last May, the federal government passed a law temporarily banning the establishment of new gambling websites here. Now it wants a permanent ban, preventing Australians from gambling on websites run in the country.</p> <p>Australia has the largest number of gambling addicts in the world. A report last year classed 290,000 people as problem gamblers and the number is growing. Ten years ago Australians on average gambled away 1.8% of their disposable income. They now fritter away 3.6%.</p> <p>The Liberal government's bill is the first attempt by federal authorities for more than 30 years to put a legislative brake on the growth of gambling and has been applauded by many churches and anti-gambling groups.</p> <p>Richard Alston, the federal communications minister, said the internet had the potential to make every home a virtual casino.</p> <p>\"It is incumbent upon governments at all levels and of all political persuasions to take strong action to combat the tragic economic and social consequences of gambling in this country,\" he said.</p> <p>But with many in the opposition Labor and Democrat parties vowing to fight the legislation, it faces a battle to get through the upper house in the next few weeks.</p> <p>Democrat senator John Woodley welcomed the legislation but attacked its detail, especially the provision allowing Australian companies to build and run lucrative online gambling sites for foreign users.</p> <p>Australia's online gambling industry is advanced and could be a major area of export growth. It can also provide an additional source of state income from taxation.</p> <p>The gaming industry and the Northern Territory government are considering challenging the bill in the high court. The gambling lobby claims jobs will be lost and argues that it is illogical to ban online lotteries and sports betting on the internet, when people can just as easily pick up a telephone to place their bets.</p> <p>The Labor party says the bill is unworkable. \"The government's proposal in this bill will do absolutely nothing to prevent those who want to gamble online from finding the sites to do that,\" said opposition spokeswoman on information technology Kate Lundy.</p> <p>The legislation will not demand that internet service providers block gambling sites, but it will require Australian online gambling firms to detect and ban users based in the country. Gamblers will still be able to use sites abroad.</p> <p>Critics say the rightwing Liberal party is simply in a panic over how to regulate the internet.

      "bodyText": "Punters in Australia flock to place dollars on every kind of race, whether it features dogs, horses, camels, cane toads, lizards or cockroaches. But they may not be able to bet on the internet for much longer. Last May, the federal government passed a law temporarily banning the establishment of new gambling websites here. Now it wants a permanent ban, preventing Australians from gambling on websites run in the country. Australia has the largest number of gambling addicts in the world. A report last year classed 290,000 people as problem gamblers and the number is growing. Ten years ago Australians on average gambled away 1.8% of their disposable income. They now fritter away 3.6%. The Liberal government's bill is the first attempt by federal authorities for more than 30 years to put a legislative brake on the growth of gambling and has been applauded by many churches and anti-gambling groups. Richard Alston, the federal communications minister, said the internet had the potential to make every home a virtual casino. \"It is incumbent upon governments at all levels and of all political persuasions to take strong action to combat the tragic economic and social consequences of gambling in this country,\" he said. But with many in the opposition Labor and Democrat parties vowing to fight the legislation, it faces a battle to get through the upper house in the next few weeks. Democrat senator John Woodley welcomed the legislation but attacked its detail, especially the provision allowing Australian companies to build and run lucrative online gambling sites for foreign users. Australia's online gambling industry is advanced and could be a major area of export growth. It can also provide an additional source of state income from taxation. The gaming industry and the Northern Territory government are considering challenging the bill in the high court. The gambling lobby claims jobs will be lost and argues that it is illogical to ban online lotteries and sports betting on the internet, when people can just as easily pick up a telephone to place their bets. The Labor party says the bill is unworkable. \"The government's proposal in this bill will do absolutely nothing to prevent those who want to gamble online from finding the sites to do that,\" said opposition spokeswoman on information technology Kate Lundy. The legislation will not demand that internet service providers block gambling sites, but it will require Australian online gambling firms to detect and ban users based in the country. Gamblers will still be able to use sites abroad. Critics say the rightwing Liberal party is simply in a panic over how to regulate the internet. At state level, the Liberal government in South Australia is trying to ban any information deemed offensive from being posted on the web, adding to the impression that rightwing forces in Australia just don't get the net. But the argument that banning internet gambling is pointless is most commonly sounded by businesses that stand to make big bucks out of problem gamblers. Labor has strongly denied that its fairly laissez faire attitude towards gambling at state and federal levels is influenced by the fact that one of the party's major donors is Kerry Packer, Australia's wealthiest man, who has hefty stakes in casinos and online gambling firms. Though clumsy, the federal legislation is a rare government move against the interests of big business. With gambling companies requiring expensive licences and paying high taxes, the industry is a lucrative source of state income. The refusal of Labour state governments in New South Wales and Victoria to put the brakes on their burgeoning offline gambling industries only adds to the suspicion that, in the words of anti-gambling crusader Tim Costello, the governments are the greatest gambling addicts in Australia.

The two founders refused to set a deadline but it is thought a decision will be taken at the end of this week. Some of the 12 staff had already been laid off. Fingertips.co.uk launched as a test website in February. Channel 4 got involved and planned to incorporate the technology, which has taken two-and-a-half years to develop, in its new entertainment portal e4.com. Channel 4's other dot.com investment to date has been in Popworld, the music portal co-founded by ex-Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller.",

This delay comes despite strong indications from the government last week that a statement would be made today. But as Mr Brown arrived at a meeting in Cumbria this morning of Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff) officials and the army, he said a firm policy had yet to be finalised. As the number of confirmed cases of foot and mouth in the UK reached 911, Mr Brown said: \"I have not come here to make any announcement. The issue is still under review. The arguments are not all one way. There are a range of strategies under consideration.\" The prime minister, Tony Blair, is said to favour a \"firebreak\" vaccination, believing it could help control the crisis, but opponents have warned that they could do long-term damage to British exports and the officials at Maff are said to be unconvinced. There have been growing calls in recent weeks from groups like the Soil Association and Farmers For Action for vaccinations to be introduced. The government was not believed to favour a mass vaccination policy, which is not favoured by any EU member state, but was more likely to consider \"firebreak\" or emergency vaccinations. Opponents of emergency vaccination have argued that it is costly, does not guarantee success, takes up to three weeks to become effective and needs repeating every six months.

Denying rumours that he was set to leave Catalonia this summer, Rivaldo said: \"The president has already said that he wants me to stay and I want to stay. But I will not be renewing my contract when it finishes in two seasons.\" The Brazilian star, who will be 31 in 2003, also said he would be leaving Spain altogether, which may come as interesting news to long-time admirers Man Utd. Patrick Vieira will not be joining Juventus or anyone else, according to the Mirror. \"I've got four years left on my contract and I want to stay at Highbury\", he said. \"I love Arsenal. The club is in my heart and leaving does not interest me.\" Harry Redknapp is set to sign a new striker in the summer, after confessing that his trio of Cole, Kanoute and Di Canio cannot play together. \"Having Joe Cole, Paolo and Freddie in the same team is not easy\", he said after Saturday's home defeat by Everton. \"Freddie hasn't got a real strike partner to play with and that's something I need to address.\" Walter Smith has denied that Paul Gascoigne's career is at an end. Gazza has spent the majority of this season out injured with a knee problem, but Smith insisted yesterday that, \"Talk of the injury ending his career is premature and, as far as we are aware at this stage, incorrect.\"",

Tim Yeo, Mr Brown's Tory shadow, said the number of animals waiting to be killed was more than double the number than when Tony Blair took personal charge. But the army hopes to have 180 trucks shifting cattle and sheep for burial by today taking them closer to their target of 24 hours from diagnosis to slaughter. Despite the lack of a formal announcement,ministers went out in a phalanx yesterday to explain Mr Blair's thinking. John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, said on GMTV: \"The prime minister is someone who by instinct believes in unity rather than division, somone who wants to be inclusive rather than exclusive.\" A slight delay in the elections would, he said, be a sign of sensitivity. Mr Straw stressed that the delay was likely to be a one-off show of support to rural communities. He said the decision had not been governed \"in terms of the practicalities of running polls but it's much more to do with sensitivity about the issue and the countryside, taking account of the national mood\". Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, said: \"I can well understand why he may well come to the view that we need some more time to make sure we have got in place the methods, the mechanisms, the resources to cope with the foot and mouth outbreak before we go to the country.\" Nevertheless, ministers will be forced to eat their words over claims that delay of the county council elections will seriously damage the tourist industry. Industry chiefs claim they are losing \u00a3200m a week in lost revenue and expressed deep disappointment at the decision. John Redwood, the Tory campaigns chief, said local elections should be postponed in the worst affected areas and Mr Blair should announce when the council polls would be held in other areas. The disease continued to affect sporting events with yesterday's decision to cancel the Cheltenham festival race meeting, which had been rearranged from March to later this month, after officials confirmed that it was within the foot and mouth exclusion zone. The meeting, which was postponed because of the livestock movement restrictions, was doomed after a new case was confirmed yesterday in Woolstone, a village five miles from the track. What happens now? April 2 Prime minister and home secretary to confirm local council elections will be held on June 7. April 3 Party managers will seek advice from the electoral commission on new spending limits. Expect to be told they can spend an extra \u00a3800,000 each. April 6 Class size and pupil teacher ratio figures released. April 15 Easter Sunday and teaching union conferences. April 26 New Deal figures released. May 14 Last date for dissolution of parliament. June 6 Monetary policy committee to give interest rate decision. June 7 General and county council elections.",

Henry McLeish will join the former James Bond star on a week-long visit to the US, where Sir Sean will spearhead a drive to restore confidence in Scotland as a tourist destination. The move is designed to combat the negative impact that images of burning carcasses and mass animal burial sites is having on the multibillion pound Scottish tourism industry. The Scottish tourist industry is worth \u00a32.5bn a year, the equivalent of 5% of the country's gross domestic product. It accounts for 180,000 jobs, making it Scotland's third-largest employer after health and education. Experts fear as many as 36,000 of those jobs could be lost as the effects of the foot and mouth crisis are felt. The news came as the government announced a new \"tourism cabinet\" had been set up to work out a foot-and-mouth recovery plan for the industry. The cabinet, set up by the English Tourism Council, will update the government on the impact of the disease and oversee an advertising campaign to stimulate tourism over the vital Easter and May bank holidays. Visits to Britain have slumped since the beginning of the outbreak and culture secretary Chris Smith warned it was costing the industry about \u00a3100m per week. It was feared that figure could rise to as much as \u00a3250m if the disease was not under control by the time the main tourist season starts. The tourism cabinet for England, due to meet on Friday, includes representatives from the ETC, the cabinet office, the British Tourist Authority, the National Trust and other industry bodies and individual attractions. It will work on international, domestic and regional recovery plans for the industry. And it emerged yesterday that British Airways is to launch an advertising campaign in the US to prevent a slide in passenger numbers as a result of fears over foot and mouth. The airline plans to advertise on TV and in newspapers to convey the message that Britain is open for business.",

      "body": "<p>Ethnic minorities are barely represented in some of the most popular programmes on British television, according to one of the most comprehensive studies on race in the media. </p> <p>Black and Asian people were found to be almost non-existent in makeover shows such as Ground Force and Home Front. And in one week on BBC2, the only ethnic minority faces to be seen in the channel's top 10 programmes - with combined viewing figures of 33m - were cartoon characters in the Simpsons. </p> <p>In drama, broadcasters are often guilty of \"colour-blind\" casting: in other words, characters from minority communities could just as easily have been white, because they display no evidence of their ethnic background. </p> <p>The appearance of ethnic minority characters in EastEnders and Coronation Street was patchy, even though the programmes are set in London and Manchester, cities with large ethnic minority populations.

      "bodyText": "Ethnic minorities are barely represented in some of the most popular programmes on British television, according to one of the most comprehensive studies on race in the media. Black and Asian people were found to be almost non-existent in makeover shows such as Ground Force and Home Front. And in one week on BBC2, the only ethnic minority faces to be seen in the channel's top 10 programmes - with combined viewing figures of 33m - were cartoon characters in the Simpsons. In drama, broadcasters are often guilty of \"colour-blind\" casting: in other words, characters from minority communities could just as easily have been white, because they display no evidence of their ethnic background. The appearance of ethnic minority characters in EastEnders and Coronation Street was patchy, even though the programmes are set in London and Manchester, cities with large ethnic minority populations. Only Channel 4's Brookside, set in Liverpool, is consistent. Apart from the occasional contribution to cookery programmes, ethnic minorities were almost invisible in the area of lifestyle programmes. By examining 204 programmes between November 20 and December 17 last year - the heart of the most competitive autumn season between the broadcasters for years - the researchers found that the overall ethnic minority representation was 8.4%, compared with 6.7% in the \"real world\". But when foreign (mainly US) films and the portrayal of visitors to the UK (such as foreign dignitaries) were excluded, the figure fell to 5.2%. Black people appeared more frequently on TV (3.7%) than in real life (2.1%). Asians were the most under-represented group: they account for 3.7% of the population but were statistically almost invisible on TV. The results of the survey come a year after the formation of the Cultural Diversity Network, set up by the broadcasters to monitor progress against published targets, and after the BBC director general, Greg Dyke, urged the TV industry to reflect the real world. Guy Cumberbatch, from the Communications Research Group, which carried out the research for the commission for racial equality, said it was not good enough simply for broadcasters to cast black people in white roles. \"We were struck by how few of the ethnic minority characters we observed were displaying cultural diversity.\" The days in which people from ethnic minorities were portrayed as \"chanting savages\" were over, but there was still a great deal to be done, he said. Gurbux Singh, chairman of the CRE, which is mounting the annual race in the media awards on Friday, said: \"Britain's most popular television programmes, broadcast to millions, still fall short of representing the full range of people that live here. \"While there are encouraging signs that the number of ethnic minority faces on television is rising, there is clearly some way to go.

      "body": "<p>As the Countess of Wessex flew out of Britain on an official visit to the Middle East at the weekend, it was in the certain knowledge that her next encounter with a sheikh would not have such catastrophic results as her last. For, despite the best efforts of Buckingham Palace, Prince Edward's wife was embroiled in controversy over toe-curlingly embarrassing remarks about other royals and politicians that she is alleged to have made to an investigative reporter posing as a Middle Eastern businessman. </p> <p>The countess was alleged to have described the prime minister as \"too presidential\" and Cherie Blair as \"horrid, absolutely horrid, horrid, horrid\". William Hague was said to be \"deformed\". She was said to have referred to the Queen as \"the old dear\" and to have claimed that Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles would marry after \"the old lady\" - the Queen Mother - dies. </p> <p>Buckingham Palace warned of \"wholesale inaccuracies\" in the story. \"We suggest that no serious journalist gives this story the time of day,\" it said, apparently more in hope than expectation. </p> <p>Indeed, the countess, formerly Sophie Rhys-Jones, appeared to give the reports credence by writing to the Blairs and to the Tory leader last week to apologise for what she had said. Compounding the embarrassment was the fact that she was speaking in her capacity as a director of her private public relations company, R-JH, which she set up in 1997, two years before she married the prince. </p> <p>As an experienced PR executive, the countess might have been expected to be more discreet. Officials and other PR practitioners described her as naive, and it was clear that she had fallen for the oldest trick in the book: a tabloid sting. </p> <p>What made the tale even more bizarre, however, was that it did not appear in the publication which obtained the original story. The News of the World published an anodyne, authorised interview with the countess, but the explosive material, obtained by its undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, was splashed across its principal rivals, the Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Mirror. </p> <p>The Mail suggested that the Queen was outraged by the alleged remarks, and that Prince Edward was \"absolutely furious\" with his wife for making them. The tale appeared under the banner headline: \"Queen's Outrage at Sophie Insults\". A similar story appeared in the Mirror. </p> <p><strong> Sexuality</strong><br> </p> <p> The News of the World, apparently as a reward for its discretion, had to make do with a formal interview at Buckingham Palace by the countess last week in which the she was obliged to answer questions about the sexuality of her husband and her difficulty in conceiving children. </p> <p>Palace officials thought that the fluffy revelations would do the job. But they reckoned without the wrath of the PR guru, Max Clifford. For it was Clifford who had first set the story in chain after an employee of R-JH had approached him with concerns about the way Sophie Wessex (as she prefers to be professionally known) was running her business. </p> <p>Clifford was furious that the NoW had been cowed into burying the story. Even though the countess had secured an injunction preventing her employee from discussing her business, he is understood to believe that the paper was not legally prevented from running any comments made by the countess, which Mahmood had taped. However, it is thought that the NoW editor, Rebekah Wade, decided not to run the original story on legal advice. Determined to see the story in print, Clifford tipped off the Mail and the Mirror. </p> <p>It emerged yesterday that Mahmood - who appears to possess an entire wardrobe of Arab get-ups - had met the countess three times over champagne at the Dorchester Hotel. She had attended the meetings with her business partner, Murray Harkin, but her police bodyguard had remained outside the room. </p> <p>R-JH has a number of blue-chip clients including the Lanesborough Hotel, JCB and the British Luxury Council and last year had a turnover of more than \u00a3660,000. As chairman, the countess's stake in the company was estimated by the Mail on Sunday as being worth \u00a3900,000 and she was said to have received a salary last year of \u00a347,763 with an additional \u00a318,000 bonus. It would have been plausible that a Middle Eastern businessman would have wanted to engage her firm - and although Sophie Wessex has insisted in public that she is sensitive to her relationship to the royal family, the fact of her position as wife of the Queen's youngest son would have been attractive. </p> <p>It was only when the NoW contacted the palace with details of what the countess is alleged to have said that horror of the situation dawned.

      "bodyText": "As the Countess of Wessex flew out of Britain on an official visit to the Middle East at the weekend, it was in the certain knowledge that her next encounter with a sheikh would not have such catastrophic results as her last. For, despite the best efforts of Buckingham Palace, Prince Edward's wife was embroiled in controversy over toe-curlingly embarrassing remarks about other royals and politicians that she is alleged to have made to an investigative reporter posing as a Middle Eastern businessman. The countess was alleged to have described the prime minister as \"too presidential\" and Cherie Blair as \"horrid, absolutely horrid, horrid, horrid\". William Hague was said to be \"deformed\". She was said to have referred to the Queen as \"the old dear\" and to have claimed that Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles would marry after \"the old lady\" - the Queen Mother - dies. Buckingham Palace warned of \"wholesale inaccuracies\" in the story. \"We suggest that no serious journalist gives this story the time of day,\" it said, apparently more in hope than expectation. Indeed, the countess, formerly Sophie Rhys-Jones, appeared to give the reports credence by writing to the Blairs and to the Tory leader last week to apologise for what she had said. Compounding the embarrassment was the fact that she was speaking in her capacity as a director of her private public relations company, R-JH, which she set up in 1997, two years before she married the prince. As an experienced PR executive, the countess might have been expected to be more discreet. Officials and other PR practitioners described her as naive, and it was clear that she had fallen for the oldest trick in the book: a tabloid sting. What made the tale even more bizarre, however, was that it did not appear in the publication which obtained the original story. The News of the World published an anodyne, authorised interview with the countess, but the explosive material, obtained by its undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, was splashed across its principal rivals, the Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Mirror. The Mail suggested that the Queen was outraged by the alleged remarks, and that Prince Edward was \"absolutely furious\" with his wife for making them. The tale appeared under the banner headline: \"Queen's Outrage at Sophie Insults\". A similar story appeared in the Mirror. Sexuality The News of the World, apparently as a reward for its discretion, had to make do with a formal interview at Buckingham Palace by the countess last week in which the she was obliged to answer questions about the sexuality of her husband and her difficulty in conceiving children. Palace officials thought that the fluffy revelations would do the job. But they reckoned without the wrath of the PR guru, Max Clifford. For it was Clifford who had first set the story in chain after an employee of R-JH had approached him with concerns about the way Sophie Wessex (as she prefers to be professionally known) was running her business. Clifford was furious that the NoW had been cowed into burying the story. Even though the countess had secured an injunction preventing her employee from discussing her business, he is understood to believe that the paper was not legally prevented from running any comments made by the countess, which Mahmood had taped. However, it is thought that the NoW editor, Rebekah Wade, decided not to run the original story on legal advice. Determined to see the story in print, Clifford tipped off the Mail and the Mirror. It emerged yesterday that Mahmood - who appears to possess an entire wardrobe of Arab get-ups - had met the countess three times over champagne at the Dorchester Hotel. She had attended the meetings with her business partner, Murray Harkin, but her police bodyguard had remained outside the room. R-JH has a number of blue-chip clients including the Lanesborough Hotel, JCB and the British Luxury Council and last year had a turnover of more than \u00a3660,000. As chairman, the countess's stake in the company was estimated by the Mail on Sunday as being worth \u00a3900,000 and she was said to have received a salary last year of \u00a347,763 with an additional \u00a318,000 bonus. It would have been plausible that a Middle Eastern businessman would have wanted to engage her firm - and although Sophie Wessex has insisted in public that she is sensitive to her relationship to the royal family, the fact of her position as wife of the Queen's youngest son would have been attractive. It was only when the NoW contacted the palace with details of what the countess is alleged to have said that horror of the situation dawned. The countess alerted the press complaints commission, and her lawyers obtained the injunction against her employee at R-JH. Press chiefs at the palace, which has recently made something of a practice of appeasing potential tabloid tormenters, offered the exclusive interview to the NoW. But the strategy was a disaster: the countess was humiliated in the Sunday papers twice over. In an attempt to regain the upper hand, the palace issued a strong statement in which it insisted that none of the quotes attributed to the countess by the Mail on Sunday was true. \"The story is riddled with inaccuracies and fictions ... the claim that the Countess has deeply upset the Queen is untrue and to run a speculative story under that headline is particularly offensive.

An individual's private life can be of no public interest in one situation and of immense public interest in another. Should privacy mean that a public figure's life is only discussed between the hours of 9am-5pm? Is it right that professional photographers and camera crews require a Greater London Authority permit to take photos in a public place such as Trafalgar Square?

Some people who are not normally in the public eye have complained about the effects of intrusion by a \"media scrum\" in the aftermath of tragedies.

Several years ago, newspaper executives complained when reporters from ITV's The Big Story series erected a 60-foot crane to film on the public pavements outside their houses following the Mirror Group's publication of photographs of Princess Diana inside her gym. The fact that different types of people want privacy from public scrutiny is used to argue that privacy is an essential need for all human beings. </p> <p> Yet why should what is freely expressed be decided according to what the object of expression feels is bad for him or her? If society is becoming more sensitive to words and images, shouldn't we debate why this is, rather than automatically draw up more regulations? </p> <p>Not everyone is more sensitive to words and images; plenty of people invite the media to invade their privacy. Celebrities confess their drink binges (Caroline Aherne), drug habits (Robbie Williams) or relationship problems (Denise Van Outen) quite happily in interviews.

The study by management consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers urges media companies to be more \"ambitious and vigilant\" in the lucrative sports market and take a leading role in organisations such as European football body Uefa. Using the example of Formula One governing body FIA, which has been forced to split its regulatory and commercial operations, the report argues that \"individualistic sports\" such as tennis and golf are ripe for exploitation. \"Investing directly in the governing body might be a move as they [global sports bodies] grapple with becoming more commercial, transparent and popular in a multichannel environment,\" says the report. The authors hope the EU ruling on the FIA - which allows media companies to buy into the commercial arm of the organisation - will \"accentuate the distinction between regulatory and commercial functions\". \"The soaring value and high level of public interests in rights negotiations means sports governing bodies are coming under greater pressure than ever before to be open and transparent in their commercial negotiations,\" the report adds. The report cites a recent investigation by the European Commission, which argued sports federations should give their commercial operations \"balanced access to the market\" - a clear hint at letting in media companies. But the PricewaterhouseCoopers advisers warn against other pitfalls in sports investment, including riding roughshod over fans' views and navigating the regulatory maze. \"Sports investment is not as cut and dried as some people might think - a strategic approach to manage this complex landscape will open up untapped opportunities in new geographic markets and sports, and mitigate risks from regulators and politicians,\" said David Lancefield, author of the report. Mr Lancefield added that investment in governing bodies was more of a \"medium-term opportunity\" for media companies. \"They are trying to become more open and that represents an opportunity not only for investment but also for taking advisory roles,\" he said.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>About 16 miles north of central London, just before the town of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, there is a small, wooded valley with a stream and a pond at the bottom: Howe Dell. A sign declares that the dell is \"a valuable urban wildlife site\". Hornbeam, ash, oak and willow grow in the valley; also carpets of bluebells and dog's mercury - though, of course, no flowers were visible when I went there last December, nor any of the wrens, chaffinches or blue tits which the sign says haunt Howe Dell. It was a grey afternoon of bare trees and earth sodden from the wettest English autumn since 1727, the year records began. Men from the local housing estates walked their dogs through clinging mud. Electric trains passed close by with their windows lit - dinky little reading lights in the first-class carriages of the expresses - but they travelled slowly.</p> <p>The railway forms the fourth side of Howe Dell, its eastern and most definite boundary, with a high, steel fence to keep out people who might damage the railway or get themselves killed. The tracks of the main line from London King's Cross to the north of England and Scotland curve here, perhaps because the engineers who surveyed the route in the late 1840s wanted to avoid the cost of embankments and bridges over Howe Dell, or because the landowner was stubborn, or because the Great Northern Railway wanted Hatfield's station to be located in the village rather than an inconvenient mile outside it. Whatever the cause, the four tracks coming down from London bend to the right and east - a gentle enough curve which trains had safely negotiated for 150 years, until October 17 2000.</p> <p>On that day at 12.23pm, the 12.10 King's Cross to Leeds express entered the curve at 115mph - the maximum permitted speed for this stretch of track - and came off the rails. Four people died. They were: Robert Alcorn, 37, a pilot from New Zealand who was travelling to Leeds to fly a Learjet from there to Jersey; Steve Arthur, 46, Alcorn's employer as the owner of the Atlantic Gulf Aviation Company, married with two children, of Pease Pottage, West Sussex; Leslie Gray, 43, a solicitor, of Tuxford, Nottinghamshire; Peter Monkhouse, 50, managing director of an advertising company, married with three children, of Headingley, Leeds.</p> <p>All four men had been in the buffet car when its roof was ripped off as it struck one of the steel stanchions placed regularly at the side of the track to support the line's overhead electric wires. Another seven coaches were derailed; the locomotive and the first two coaches remained on the track. If the same number of dead had been recorded in a motorway accident, it would have been a small news item. It threatened no record in recent British railway crashes (Southall, 1997, seven dead; Ladbroke Grove, 1999, 31 dead). Historical comparison made it almost a minor incident (the three-train Quintinshill collision, 1915, 227 dead).</p> <p>But no other railway accident in British history has led to the degree of public anger, managerial panic, political confusion, blame and counter-blame that came in the wake of the Hatfield crash. In fact, outside wars and nuclear accidents, it is hard to think of any technological failure which has had such lasting and widespread effects (to those not directly involved, not struggling for life in the Atlantic or bereaved on land, the Titanic was simply a very thrilling story, a chilling entertainment).</p> <p>A week or so later, when overfilled rivers began to flood low-lying England and the first people were emptied from their sandbagged homes into boats, the unsettling impression grew of Britain as an unsound country, weakly equipped, underskilled, easily made chaotic and only superficially modern; an incompetent society. \"We must be the laughing stock of Europe,\" people said. The reason was elementary: movement. People could not move, in an economy - the world's fourth or fifth largest - which depended on millions of everyday, necessary journeys. Few trains ran; those that did ran unreliably, even to the revised schedules that sometimes doubled or trebled the normal journey times. Travellers tried other methods; motorways became impassable, domestic flights overbooked. At railway stations, even aboard a train itself, would-be passengers were advised to travel \"only if your journey is really necessary\"; the train may depart, but it may not arrive - nothing could be guaranteed. In any case, what was necessity? Arriving at the office? Reaching a funeral? Getting home? The question hadn't been asked in Britain since the belt-tightening poster campaigns of the second world war. People old enough to remember then - long trains packed with troops crawling through blackouts and air raids - compared that period favourably with the present. Then, there was an enemy; Britain was a more capable nation.</p> <p>Two months after the crash, as I walked around Howe Dell, none of this had abated. Every day the newspapers reported a new crisis of trust and confidence in the railways and the businesses which own them (new rail horror: my journey to hell). I expected to find cut flowers at the site - the \"floral tributes\" that mark places of death by accident or murder on many British streets: bouquets tied to lamp posts and the flashing beacons at pedestrian crossings (there were 3,423 deaths on British roads and 33 on railways in 1999). I wanted, I suppose, some bitter monument, the names of the dead attached to a slogan - Killed by Stubborn Political Ideology, maybe, or They Died in the Cause of Profit; something to set against the sweetness of the wildflower information of the sign across the stream in the woods. But other than the mud churned up by the cranes and lorries which lifted the wreckage and took it away, there was no evidence that anything fatal and important had ever happened here.</p> <p>What was the cause of this crash and these deaths? On the night of October 17, various theories were aired - a terrorist bomb, vandalism, some fault with the train, driver error, signal error. By the next day, however, the immediate cause was identified and publicised: a broken rail. A 100ft length of steel became the assassin, the Gavrilo Princip in the case, but, like the sluggish underlying causes and abrupt consequences of the first world war, how and why it came to break, and why its shattering dislocated the life of Britain - these causes stretch back and out into the wider world of politics and history beyond Howe Dell. We could begin in Babylonia.</p> <p>In a 1937 leaflet on the evolution of rail transport, Charles E Lee wrote that a railway \"is merely a specialised form of road designed to meet limited needs\". According to Lee, the earliest evidence of railways by this definition occurs in the Babylonian empire ruled by Belus, about 2245 BC. Around this time - not much after middle stone age families were sitting around Howe Dell, chipping flints - Babylonian stonemasons were instructed to build certain imperial roads as two parallel lines of stone, 5ft (or three cubits) apart, so that vehicles of the same 5ft axle-width could be pulled along by mules and horses which walked down the centre of the track. This system made haulage easier, but it seems to have contained no means of making sure that a vehicle stayed on the track.</p> <p>Railways by their more exact definition, as prepared tracks which by their construction keep the vehicle in place and guide it independently of human or animal interference, were probably first known in Greece. Around 400 BC, Greek ships were pulled across the isthmus at Corinth on wheeled cradles which travelled along grooves cut into the rock. A prolonged and rail-less interval followed the collapse of Greek and Roman civilisations, until, around the 12th century, German miners began to spread across central Europe in the search for exploitable seams of metal ore: iron, lead, silver, copper and gold. Illustrated books published in Germany in the 16th century have lively woodcuts of bearded men in pointed woollen headwear pushing small trucks from the mine's mouth on wooden rails.</p> <p>But keeping the trucks on the wooden track remained a large problem when both wheel and rail were flat at their point of contact, with nothing to prevent the one leaving the other. Various methods evolved, but the breakthrough was the flange, the edge which extends beyond the wheel's running surface and prevents it going astray. The first documented railway in England (Wollaton, near Nottingham, 1603) probably had trucks with flanged wheels. Like almost every railway built in Britain over the next two centuries, the Wollaton line transported coal from a pithead; and as the coal industry grew so railways and flanged wheels proliferated. Continental Europe, when it came to import the technology of flanged wheels and iron rails from Britain in the last quarter of the 18th century, knew it as the voie anglaise or the englischer Schienenweg - the English railway.</p> <p>And yet, among all this modernity, one thing remained unconsidered and immutable: the width between the parallel rails, the gauge. In Babylonia, in Greece, at Pompeii, if not in the narrow tunnels of the European metal mines, it had always measured somewhere between 4ft and just over 5ft.</p> <p>In 1821, when George Stephenson was appointed engineer on the world's first public railway, the Stockton and Darlington line, the width between the rails was 4ft 8in. And this became one of the world's most ubiquitous measurements. Of the 750,000 route miles of railway that exist in the world today, 60% measure 4ft 8 in from rail to rail. Trains followed this gauge to the battlefields of the American Civil War and the Somme, into the Vatican City, to the tragic little terminus under the gate at Auschwitz. On this gauge, Buster Keaton outwitted the Union army. Across it, many silent heroines were tied. And, of course, on October 17 last year it was also the gauge that carried the 12.10 north from London, with 170 passengers, including four men of middle age named Alcorn, Arthur, Monkhouse and Gray. Five minutes out of King's Cross, somewhere between Finsbury Park and Hornsey, if my frequent experience is any guide, an announcement was made from the buffet car. It was open and selling \"traditional and gourmet sandwiches, hot toasties, pastries, and hot and cold drinks\". The four men rose from their first-class seats and swayed up the train. Alexandra Palace went by on its green hill. The train accelerated and bore on through the tunnels and stations of the north London suburbs: New Southgate, Oakleigh Park, New Barnet, Potters Bar. The names of the stations became too blurred by speed to read, the tunnels no more than a momentary darkness and a change of noise and pressure that shuddered the carriage windows.</p> <p>Thirteen miles out: the first countryside - cows, woods, what might still be a farmhouse. The four men were by now sitting before white tablecloths and waiting for lunch. Alcorn sat across from Arthur at one table, Monkhouse and Gray at another over the aisle. Behind the bar, small bottles of Merlot Cabernet jiggled in a glass cabinet. Steam hissed from the tea and coffee machine. Fourteen miles out, Brookmans Park. A mile and 30 seconds later, Welham Green. Some flat modern factories and warehouses appeared on the left with large and legible signs: Soundcraft, Tesco, Falcon for games, puzzles and playing cards, Mitsubishi. If any of the four men looked out of the window at this point, Mitsubishi would be the last word he ever read.</p> <p>The first rails to be made completely of metal came out of the Dowlais ironworks in South Wales in 1791. They were cast iron, much more durable than wood, but also brittle; they broke. The great quest in the 210-year history of rails since then has been to find a rail that will not break. The answer, for a time, was wrought iron, which is what Stephenson used on the Stockton and Darlington line, and again later on the world's first passenger railway, the Liverpool and Manchester. They also broke. By 1832, only two years after the railway opened, it was noticed that fragments of iron littered the track.

The wheels no longer ran clackety-clack over the joins (\"What's the train saying?\" our fathers would say. \"Peas-and-beans, peas-and-beans, peas-and-beans? Or is it fish-and-chips, fish-and-chips, fish-and-chips? What's for tea?\") British engineers followed European practice and welded the lengths of rail together.

In 1995, as part of regular repair and maintenance work, new rails of this kind were laid at Howe Dell. Like most rails in Britain, they were made by British Steel (now part of an Anglo-Dutch company, Corus) at its plant in Workington, Cumbria. They weren't quite standard. When rails are expected to carry an extra stress, they are especially hardened at the factory by quenching them with water as soon as they leave the rollers, a process called \"mill heat treatment\". These were mill heat treated (MHT) rails; they were to be laid on the curve. And curves bring their own problems.</p> <p>Engineering is often easier to depict than to describe. One striking thing about engineers is how often they want to draw things; words not being up to the work of describing the technical reality. During the research for this piece, I was handed several instant drawings. In a phenomenon known as \"the dynamics of the wheel/rail interface\", drawing is especially useful. One day in November I took the train from London to Peterborough - a very slow train that moved gingerly over the crash site - to meet a young engineer, Philip Haigh. \"Give us a pen,\" he said at one point, and then: \"Do you have a 5p piece?\" He drew round the circumference of the coin to produce a circle with a diameter of about in or 2cm. That was the size of the contact area between a wheel and a rail when train and track were in perfect equilibrium. Perfection requires the straightest rail and the truest wheel; but if these ideal conditions were met, Haigh said, then only a in strip would wear along the rail top (which is 2in wide). In an electric locomotive, 100 tons of vehicle and machinery could be shared among eight wheels and eight of these 5p contact spots. Each 5p would support a weight of 12.5 tons. Given a powerful engine, the friction caused by turning all eight wheels against two rails would easily haul a train of 1,000 tons at 115 miles an hour.</p> <p>And when the train reaches a curve? \"The contact spot shifts for both wheel and rail,\" Haigh said. What happens is this: the wheels are asked to obey a new direction by the rail. That instruction, combined with centrifugal force, pushes the wheel against the rail on the outside of a curve. The shoulder between flange and wheel hits the corner of the rail. At low speed, that hardly matters, the train will scrape round. At high speed, say 125mph, the train needs some corrective to try to restore its equilibrium. Therefore the track is \"canted\" - tilted like the racing track in a velodrome, with the outside rail the higher of the two. But different kinds of train travel at different speeds and would need different levels of cant if their equilibrium was always to be perfect. Engineers reach a compromise: a cant that will work at different speeds, though not perfectly for all of them. At high speed, the wheels still shift position and put an extra stress on the higher rail, attacking its inner corner, the corner from which the gauge is measured: the gauge corner.</p> <p>Rails are made to take pressure from the top. Exposed to this different, sideways pressure from, say, 60 fast trains a day, seven days a week, they can begin to crack: gauge corner cracking. Curves are by no means the only cause of damaged rails. The steel may contain flaws, little voids that are difficult and sometimes impossible to detect with the human eye. Wheels that are out of shape and not perfectly circular can batter and dent the rail. The ground beneath can subside by an inch and twist the rail. The railhead can flake. The more engineers I talked to, the more I saw rails in a new light; not as simple and indestructible - the Iron Road - but as complicated and vulnerable. Railway engineers have always seen them as a technology that needs constant vigilance.</p> <p>At a railway engineering exhibition in Birmingham, I met a retired engineer, Bill Armstrong, who spoke about the track as \"a living thing\". Rails were always shifting, settling, creeping this way or that. As the chief permanent way engineer for a large part of Yorkshire, he'd been required to walk every mile of his track twice a year - many dozens of miles on foot, twice a year, peering at the rails. The inspectors under him walked every mile of track in their care at least once a month; in turn, the sub-inspectors under them walked it at least once a fortnight. In this way, every mile of line was patrolled not less than twice a week. Passenger lines were inspected no fewer than three times, usually on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. \"We had a saying,\" Armstrong said. \"The uninspected inevitably deteriorates.\"</p> <p>We were talking inside one of the bleak halls of Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre. The Hatfield crash had cast a gloom over this year's fair. At a couple of seminars in side rooms I'd heard speakers despair of the national culture: \"a dearth of engineers . . . a basic lack of engineering competence . . . not enough people who understand how the infrastructure works or behaves.\"</p> <p>Armstrong said: \"How many folk in this country, even the ones who're interested in railways, know what happens below the wheel? With them, it's always the wheel upwards. Below the wheel matters. You know the trouble with England? We've never had the guts to rip things down and start again. It's all make do and mend.\" He had an analogy. \"It's like having a wife who keeps asking you to paint the front door when the more important job is to get the damp seen to in the cellar.\"</p> <p>He spoke about an everyday garden nuisance: the weed. \"In the old days you'd never see a weed on the line. That was when you had six chaps working from the same hut, looking after their bit of track. Weeds are evidence of neglect, they clog the drainage in the ballast, the ballast becomes uneven, the tracks sink or twist.\"</p> <p>And now? \"The days of a line being patrolled by a man every day have gone. But it's worse than that. Not only have the maintenance structures disappeared, but the knowledge of what the structures did has disappeared.\"</p> <p>The great change happened in the middle years of the 90s, its centrepiece the Railways Act, which was passed by the Conservative government under John Major in 1993.

Scalding water exploded in the buffet car. Apart from the dead, two buffet attendants and two other passengers were seriously injured, another 66 passengers slightly so.

      "bodyText": "About 16 miles north of central London, just before the town of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, there is a small, wooded valley with a stream and a pond at the bottom: Howe Dell. A sign declares that the dell is \"a valuable urban wildlife site\". Hornbeam, ash, oak and willow grow in the valley; also carpets of bluebells and dog's mercury - though, of course, no flowers were visible when I went there last December, nor any of the wrens, chaffinches or blue tits which the sign says haunt Howe Dell. It was a grey afternoon of bare trees and earth sodden from the wettest English autumn since 1727, the year records began. Men from the local housing estates walked their dogs through clinging mud. Electric trains passed close by with their windows lit - dinky little reading lights in the first-class carriages of the expresses - but they travelled slowly. The railway forms the fourth side of Howe Dell, its eastern and most definite boundary, with a high, steel fence to keep out people who might damage the railway or get themselves killed. The tracks of the main line from London King's Cross to the north of England and Scotland curve here, perhaps because the engineers who surveyed the route in the late 1840s wanted to avoid the cost of embankments and bridges over Howe Dell, or because the landowner was stubborn, or because the Great Northern Railway wanted Hatfield's station to be located in the village rather than an inconvenient mile outside it. Whatever the cause, the four tracks coming down from London bend to the right and east - a gentle enough curve which trains had safely negotiated for 150 years, until October 17 2000. On that day at 12.23pm, the 12.10 King's Cross to Leeds express entered the curve at 115mph - the maximum permitted speed for this stretch of track - and came off the rails. Four people died. They were: Robert Alcorn, 37, a pilot from New Zealand who was travelling to Leeds to fly a Learjet from there to Jersey; Steve Arthur, 46, Alcorn's employer as the owner of the Atlantic Gulf Aviation Company, married with two children, of Pease Pottage, West Sussex; Leslie Gray, 43, a solicitor, of Tuxford, Nottinghamshire; Peter Monkhouse, 50, managing director of an advertising company, married with three children, of Headingley, Leeds. All four men had been in the buffet car when its roof was ripped off as it struck one of the steel stanchions placed regularly at the side of the track to support the line's overhead electric wires. Another seven coaches were derailed; the locomotive and the first two coaches remained on the track. If the same number of dead had been recorded in a motorway accident, it would have been a small news item. It threatened no record in recent British railway crashes (Southall, 1997, seven dead; Ladbroke Grove, 1999, 31 dead). Historical comparison made it almost a minor incident (the three-train Quintinshill collision, 1915, 227 dead). But no other railway accident in British history has led to the degree of public anger, managerial panic, political confusion, blame and counter-blame that came in the wake of the Hatfield crash. In fact, outside wars and nuclear accidents, it is hard to think of any technological failure which has had such lasting and widespread effects (to those not directly involved, not struggling for life in the Atlantic or bereaved on land, the Titanic was simply a very thrilling story, a chilling entertainment). A week or so later, when overfilled rivers began to flood low-lying England and the first people were emptied from their sandbagged homes into boats, the unsettling impression grew of Britain as an unsound country, weakly equipped, underskilled, easily made chaotic and only superficially modern; an incompetent society. \"We must be the laughing stock of Europe,\" people said. The reason was elementary: movement. People could not move, in an economy - the world's fourth or fifth largest - which depended on millions of everyday, necessary journeys. Few trains ran; those that did ran unreliably, even to the revised schedules that sometimes doubled or trebled the normal journey times. Travellers tried other methods; motorways became impassable, domestic flights overbooked. At railway stations, even aboard a train itself, would-be passengers were advised to travel \"only if your journey is really necessary\"; the train may depart, but it may not arrive - nothing could be guaranteed. In any case, what was necessity? Arriving at the office? Reaching a funeral? Getting home? The question hadn't been asked in Britain since the belt-tightening poster campaigns of the second world war. People old enough to remember then - long trains packed with troops crawling through blackouts and air raids - compared that period favourably with the present. Then, there was an enemy; Britain was a more capable nation. Two months after the crash, as I walked around Howe Dell, none of this had abated. Every day the newspapers reported a new crisis of trust and confidence in the railways and the businesses which own them (new rail horror: my journey to hell). I expected to find cut flowers at the site - the \"floral tributes\" that mark places of death by accident or murder on many British streets: bouquets tied to lamp posts and the flashing beacons at pedestrian crossings (there were 3,423 deaths on British roads and 33 on railways in 1999). I wanted, I suppose, some bitter monument, the names of the dead attached to a slogan - Killed by Stubborn Political Ideology, maybe, or They Died in the Cause of Profit; something to set against the sweetness of the wildflower information of the sign across the stream in the woods. But other than the mud churned up by the cranes and lorries which lifted the wreckage and took it away, there was no evidence that anything fatal and important had ever happened here. What was the cause of this crash and these deaths? On the night of October 17, various theories were aired - a terrorist bomb, vandalism, some fault with the train, driver error, signal error. By the next day, however, the immediate cause was identified and publicised: a broken rail. A 100ft length of steel became the assassin, the Gavrilo Princip in the case, but, like the sluggish underlying causes and abrupt consequences of the first world war, how and why it came to break, and why its shattering dislocated the life of Britain - these causes stretch back and out into the wider world of politics and history beyond Howe Dell. We could begin in Babylonia. In a 1937 leaflet on the evolution of rail transport, Charles E Lee wrote that a railway \"is merely a specialised form of road designed to meet limited needs\". According to Lee, the earliest evidence of railways by this definition occurs in the Babylonian empire ruled by Belus, about 2245 BC. Around this time - not much after middle stone age families were sitting around Howe Dell, chipping flints - Babylonian stonemasons were instructed to build certain imperial roads as two parallel lines of stone, 5ft (or three cubits) apart, so that vehicles of the same 5ft axle-width could be pulled along by mules and horses which walked down the centre of the track. This system made haulage easier, but it seems to have contained no means of making sure that a vehicle stayed on the track. Railways by their more exact definition, as prepared tracks which by their construction keep the vehicle in place and guide it independently of human or animal interference, were probably first known in Greece. Around 400 BC, Greek ships were pulled across the isthmus at Corinth on wheeled cradles which travelled along grooves cut into the rock. A prolonged and rail-less interval followed the collapse of Greek and Roman civilisations, until, around the 12th century, German miners began to spread across central Europe in the search for exploitable seams of metal ore: iron, lead, silver, copper and gold. Illustrated books published in Germany in the 16th century have lively woodcuts of bearded men in pointed woollen headwear pushing small trucks from the mine's mouth on wooden rails. But keeping the trucks on the wooden track remained a large problem when both wheel and rail were flat at their point of contact, with nothing to prevent the one leaving the other. Various methods evolved, but the breakthrough was the flange, the edge which extends beyond the wheel's running surface and prevents it going astray. The first documented railway in England (Wollaton, near Nottingham, 1603) probably had trucks with flanged wheels. Like almost every railway built in Britain over the next two centuries, the Wollaton line transported coal from a pithead; and as the coal industry grew so railways and flanged wheels proliferated. Continental Europe, when it came to import the technology of flanged wheels and iron rails from Britain in the last quarter of the 18th century, knew it as the voie anglaise or the englischer Schienenweg - the English railway. And yet, among all this modernity, one thing remained unconsidered and immutable: the width between the parallel rails, the gauge. In Babylonia, in Greece, at Pompeii, if not in the narrow tunnels of the European metal mines, it had always measured somewhere between 4ft and just over 5ft. In 1821, when George Stephenson was appointed engineer on the world's first public railway, the Stockton and Darlington line, the width between the rails was 4ft 8in. And this became one of the world's most ubiquitous measurements. Of the 750,000 route miles of railway that exist in the world today, 60% measure 4ft 8 in from rail to rail. Trains followed this gauge to the battlefields of the American Civil War and the Somme, into the Vatican City, to the tragic little terminus under the gate at Auschwitz. On this gauge, Buster Keaton outwitted the Union army. Across it, many silent heroines were tied. And, of course, on October 17 last year it was also the gauge that carried the 12.10 north from London, with 170 passengers, including four men of middle age named Alcorn, Arthur, Monkhouse and Gray. Five minutes out of King's Cross, somewhere between Finsbury Park and Hornsey, if my frequent experience is any guide, an announcement was made from the buffet car. It was open and selling \"traditional and gourmet sandwiches, hot toasties, pastries, and hot and cold drinks\". The four men rose from their first-class seats and swayed up the train. Alexandra Palace went by on its green hill. The train accelerated and bore on through the tunnels and stations of the north London suburbs: New Southgate, Oakleigh Park, New Barnet, Potters Bar. The names of the stations became too blurred by speed to read, the tunnels no more than a momentary darkness and a change of noise and pressure that shuddered the carriage windows. Thirteen miles out: the first countryside - cows, woods, what might still be a farmhouse. The four men were by now sitting before white tablecloths and waiting for lunch. Alcorn sat across from Arthur at one table, Monkhouse and Gray at another over the aisle. Behind the bar, small bottles of Merlot Cabernet jiggled in a glass cabinet. Steam hissed from the tea and coffee machine. Fourteen miles out, Brookmans Park. A mile and 30 seconds later, Welham Green. Some flat modern factories and warehouses appeared on the left with large and legible signs: Soundcraft, Tesco, Falcon for games, puzzles and playing cards, Mitsubishi. If any of the four men looked out of the window at this point, Mitsubishi would be the last word he ever read. The first rails to be made completely of metal came out of the Dowlais ironworks in South Wales in 1791. They were cast iron, much more durable than wood, but also brittle; they broke. The great quest in the 210-year history of rails since then has been to find a rail that will not break. The answer, for a time, was wrought iron, which is what Stephenson used on the Stockton and Darlington line, and again later on the world's first passenger railway, the Liverpool and Manchester. They also broke. By 1832, only two years after the railway opened, it was noticed that fragments of iron littered the track. By 1839, every one of the line's original rails had been replaced. Eleven years later, when the Great Northern Railway opened its main line between London and Peterborough via Hatfield, the pattern was repeated. The rails there also soon began to chip and fragment under the weight of heavy coal traffic. By 1865, the entire line had been re-railed and so railways began to experiment with steel. Steel rails were a third more expensive, but trials showed that they lasted four to six times longer than wrought iron. By the 1880s almost every main line in England, including the Great Northern's, had been relaid in steel, but that too had problems. Steel could last for years, shining brightly in the signal lights, apparently perfect, and then suddenly it would snap. In the 1950s, the noise made by the combination of track and train began to change. The wheels no longer ran clackety-clack over the joins (\"What's the train saying?\" our fathers would say. \"Peas-and-beans, peas-and-beans, peas-and-beans? Or is it fish-and-chips, fish-and-chips, fish-and-chips? What's for tea?\") British engineers followed European practice and welded the lengths of rail together. The tiny gap between each rail length disappeared. When trains ran over continuously welded track the cost of their tractive energy was cut by 5%, by the single act of removing the tiny gap or the infinitesimal difference in position between one rail and the next; the price of peas-and-beans. Then, in 1967, 49 passengers died when a train derailed on unwelded track at Hither Green in south London. The cause was a rail which had fractured at its weakest point, the bolt-holes at the join. Rails thereafter were made to a new specification, with a thicker \"web\" - the spine that joins railhead to railfoot - and a new weight of 113lb.

But it is a drama which is being watched in rather different ways by western governments and by the peoples of the region to which Milosevic brought so much suffering.</p> <p>Western governments see mainly the progressive humiliation of the leader they blame for involving them in conflicts they wished to avoid, a man who challenged them and tricked them and made them look alternately craven and stupid. People in the region, on the other hand, had already consigned Milosevic, as a man, to history. Naturally he has his supporters in Serbia, Montenegro and the Bosnian Serb entity, Republika Srpska, but most are less true supporters than people who have been trying to keep him out of court because they do not want to go down with him.</p> <p>Then there are those, whether from the Milosevic camp or from outside it, who want to inherit some of the assets he once controlled and inherit some of the influence he once exercised. They care for or about him only because they are looking out for themselves. Just as his supporters see him only as an instrument, his more principled enemies are less interested in his judgment and punishment in itself than in the fact that such a judgment should open the way to judgment on many others. More important still, they hope that it could lead to the definitive isolation of the dark political forces that Milosevic was able to concentrate.</p> <p>Given the normal stereotype of Balkan characteristics, it is curious that the west may be more vengeful in its attitude towards Milosevic as an individual than those who were his local opponents. The critical question in Serbia is not whether Milosevic is going to pay the price for his crimes, but whether the continuity, partial but real, between the attitudes of the Milosevic years and those prevailing now can be broken.</p> <p>\"Half of the present government should be in the courtroom at the Hague,\" one Serb human rights worker snapped, when talking about Milosevic. President Vojislav Kostunica may not be one of those who should be there, but he has set himself up, since overthrowing Milosevic, as a kind of nationalist beacon. \"I see a new phase of folklore beginning to develop,\" a worker for an international agency said, \"in which both Milosevic and Nato are the villains, and Serbia once again the victim.\"</p> <p>The Milosevic arrest is an important moment in the Serbian political struggle, which is between those who want a limited and essentially fraudulent settlement of the accounts of the last 10 years and those who want the process taken through to a proper end. But it is not yet a victory for the latter, because groups with very different ideas about Serbian renewal are trying to use Milosevic for different ends. A continued failure to arrest him would have been a clear signal that the wrong people were in charge in Serbia or that nationalist forces, whether of the old or the new kind, were too strong for the more realistic and liberal elements in the government to risk confrontation. But his arrest is not a clear signal that the opposite is true.</p> <p>Serbia's political orientation is important throughout former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia, Montenegro and Kosovo. In these places, it is not so much that, after the brief excitement of the siege of Milosevic's home, it is back to business as usual. It is back, rather, to unfinished business as usual. In Bosnia, especially, there is disinterest in the civil charges Milosevic faces. \"This issue will only come alive here if he goes to the Hague,\" says the journalist Amra Kebo, \"because we could not see how the international community could have Milosevic at the Hague and not have Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic there as well.\"</p> <p>The international troops in Bosnia, notably slow in picking up men indicted by the Hague, would have to start work in earnest. But the most pressing problems with Serbia now are obviously not to do with Milosevic but with Kostunica, who has encouraged and helped the unreconstructed nationalists in Republika Srpska. How the Milosevic arrest and the political and legal manoeuvring that follows will ultimately affect Kostunica's standing, and therefore the behaviour of political leaders in Republika Srpska, is a key question for Bosnia.</p> <p>In Montenegro, those advocating independence hope that the arrest will dishearten the opponents of independence led by the Montenegro branch of Milosevic's party. The blow for them comes as the campaigning begins for elections next month in which the pro-independence parties could well win a victory big enough to proceed swiftly to a successful referendum on pulling out of the federation. Again, the question is whether Kostunica has already replaced Milosevic as a factor in the morale of the so-called Yugoslav bloc of Montenegro parties.</p> <p>The interest of Kosovans in the Montenegrin elections is that formal separation from Serbia would strengthen the case for Kosovo's independence, and hence their more distant interest in the Milosevic case is in whether it might help push Montenegro one way or another. In Macedonia, even more distant from the impact of the arrest, the interest is in how the outcome in Kosovo, after a Montenegrin separation, might affect the troubled border region. \"Everything in former Yugoslavia, unfortunately, is connected to everything else,\" observed a diplomat in Belgrade. The connections mainly lead outward from Serbia, whose political condition can still have an important effect on events elsewhere, even though the wars of the 90s are over, and it is now impoverished and desperate for aid.</p> <p>The broad picture in the region is that nationalist extremism, Serbian and other, has a considerable capacity to regroup and to reinvent itself.

The most blatant, an 89th-minute bear-hug by Mark Williams on the Bolton substitute Ian Marshall left Allardyce furious. \"Williams had his arms all around Ian Marshall, but we are not getting what we deserve at the moment and the man in the middle is the culprit for that,\" he said. \"There is no question in my mind that the referee refused a blatant penalty.\" Honesty may be forced to take a back seat in the push for promotion. \"The gaffer has told us he's sick to death of telling us to go down in box,\" the Bolton defender Simon Charlton revealed. \"It's part of the game nowadays.\" \"Not getting the win is a massive blow,\" Allardyce added. \"The longer we go without a home win, the harder it gets for us.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>That, as we used to say in Sheffield 50 years ago, \"will learn him\". No sooner had Tony Blair addressed the Christian Socialist Movement on the close relationship between faith and politics than the Archbishop of York intensified the prime minister's election date agony by echoing William Hague's call for the proposed May poll to be postponed. <br><br>Let us hope that the primate - who has never before said much of note on any social issue - will continue to demonstrate that religious authority can be used to justify anything. I have heard the Bible quoted to prove that homosexuality is intrinsically evil, that capital punishment is just retribution and that eating animal flesh is ordained by God.</p> <p>Between us, the prime minister and I make up the two halves of the Christian socialist equation. He is one and I am the other. But, back in the days when I could not distinguish between the verbs to learn and teach, I was regularly in the congregation of the Sheffield Socialist Sunday School. It was held in what I now regard as a comment on the relationship between religion and politics - the old cobblers' shop of our local Co-op store. We expressed views which, although I support them still, are not likely to attract Tony Blair's support.</p> <p>Services always began with our version of the national anthem. \"When will thou save the people, Oh God of mercy, when? The people, Lord, the people! Not crowns or thrones, but men.\" We then considered the application of Biblical texts to modern life and decided that holy writ was timeless. It was, we agreed, still as difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven as it was for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. Our advice to such people was to take all they had and give it to the poor. I am not sure that the prime minister - who has called for the creation of more millionaires - endorses that recommendation.</p> <p>As I approached the age of discretion, I began to suspect that somewhere in Sheffield, the Christian faction of the Young Conservatives were also quoting the Bible in support of their beliefs. I assumed that they began with Matthew 25 as proof that anyone who makes 100% profit on an investment is a \"good and faithful servant\". And I imagined that they then moved on to condemnation of those foolish virgins - an allegory of the undeserving poor - who made no provisions for hard times. I took it for granted that no reference was made to the moneylenders being driven from the temple.</p> <p>I am not suggesting that the ideological right is not entitled to quote the Bible in its support. Indeed, my objection to the confusion of religion and politics is that they have and they will. Christians in my experience - admittedly limited to the Salvation Army - do wondrous works on behalf of their fellow men and women. That is because they choose to live according to the Bible's more compassionate verses. But equally the ghastly television evangelists of the southern states of America will argue that their opposition to state-financed welfare is justified by the Bible's emphasis on individual responsibility. I think I am my brother's keeper. They do not.</p> <p>When, in the Socialist Sunday School, we discovered that the Bible justifies everything and anything, we began to discuss Christian issues rather than the Christian gospels. I vividly recall the debate about St Martin, the Roman centurion who cut his cloak in half so that he should share it with a beggar. We agreed that he was to be condemned for not giving the whole thing away. We had moved from St Paul to Proudhon and in our innocence believed that all property was theft.</p> <p>However, thanks to the Socialist Sunday School, I did find a sensible moral philosopher in whom I could believe. I believe in him still. Until I read RH Tawney's Equality, I was a Labour supporter because that is what I was brought up to be. He made me a socialist because it offered the hope of a better society. I read the book again recently in preparation for a radio programme and was, once more, left breathless by the brilliance with which he destroyed the arguments for an unequal society.</p> <p>Christian charity ought to prompt someone to send a copy to No 10. It should be accompanied by a note which explains that the Bible's conflicting assertions illustrate the absurdity of pretending that men and women of goodwill - freed from political prejudice - can work together to solve common problems. We cannot even agree about what the problems and their solutions are. It is ideology which provides answers, and we should abandon the nonsensical notion that ecumenical politics can elevate government to new heights of public service. For politicians the important text is \"render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's\".</p>",

It was, we agreed, still as difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven as it was for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. Our advice to such people was to take all they had and give it to the poor. I am not sure that the prime minister - who has called for the creation of more millionaires - endorses that recommendation.

And I imagined that they then moved on to condemnation of those foolish virgins - an allegory of the undeserving poor - who made no provisions for hard times. I took it for granted that no reference was made to the moneylenders being driven from the temple. I am not suggesting that the ideological right is not entitled to quote the Bible in its support.

When, in the Socialist Sunday School, we discovered that the Bible justifies everything and anything, we began to discuss Christian issues rather than the Christian gospels. I vividly recall the debate about St Martin, the Roman centurion who cut his cloak in half so that he should share it with a beggar. We agreed that he was to be condemned for not giving the whole thing away. We had moved from St Paul to Proudhon and in our innocence believed that all property was theft. However, thanks to the Socialist Sunday School, I did find a sensible moral philosopher in whom I could believe. I believe in him still. Until I read RH Tawney's Equality, I was a Labour supporter because that is what I was brought up to be. He made me a socialist because it offered the hope of a better society.

To be spending less than 0.5% of the economy's annual output on restoring the tattered remnants of the public realm is scandalous.

Only then will we see a full flowering of the government's progressive vision. Margaret Thatcher's radical phase was her second term between 1983 and 1987, which saw her take on and defeat the miners, sell off chunks of state-owned industry, and abolish the GLC and the metropolitan councils. </p> <p>Before that she had enough on her plate bringing down inflation from 20%, coping with mass unemployment and fighting the Falklands war, without heeding those in her government and in the free-market think-tanks peddling the ideas that would lay the foundations for the second term revolution. With Labour a demoralised rump of a party in 1983, she had the ideas and the opportunity to get radical. </p> <p>It is possible that Blair has merely been biding his time, storing up all his radical ideas for a second term. Did you see a pink, four-legged creature with wings and trotters float past your window? </p> <p>The reality is that politics now is more like the 1950s than the 1980s. In the 50s, the Conservatives were in power but did not do very much. They took over from Labour in 1951 at a time when the economic climate turned benign, when inflationary pressure was minimal and world demand strong. They accepted the status quo inherited from the Attlee government - that large chunks of the economy should be in state hands, that full employment should be the centrepiece of economic policy, that capital should shoulder some of the responsibility for building up the welfare state - and stayed in charge for 13 years, making only incremental changes. </p> <p>In some respects, the Conservatives did some of the things that Labour had never quite got round to doing; the mass expansion of council housing, for example, took place only after 1951. There were regular periods of breast-beating when it became clear that Britain, despite the favourable economic background, was performing far less well than Germany or France, but for the most part it was a time when the Conservative party thought that the point of politics was for it to stay in power rather than to change things. </p> <p>Like the Conservatives, this Labour government took over when the economic climate was set fair. For the first time in decades it is possible to run the economy at about 3% growth without stoking up inflation. Full employment, if not yet a reality, is a definite possibility. Of the four big macroeconomic indicators, only the balance of payments, the Achilles' heel of the British economy, gives cause for concern. </p> <p>Moreover, Labour accepts the traditional consensus. It believes low inflation is the prime objective of economic policy, that the balance of power in the workplace is just about right, that the industries privatised by the Conservatives should remain privatised, with a couple of new ones thrown in for good measure, it idolises business (the bigger the better). It seems to have no trouble, either, with 50s-style social authoritarianism. This is not a government that, even were it to be in power for 50 years, looks interested in rocking the boat. It just wants to change course by a couple of degrees. </p> <p>Such an approach may be justified. It may be that much of what happened in the final quarter of the 20th century was necessary, right and irreversible. It may be that capitalism has now reached a point of near perfection so tinkering with the machine is all that is necessary. Labour's pollsters would argue that anything more radical would risk alienating the contented masses of Middle England, driving them back into the arms of the Conservatives. </p> <p>But there is a different way of looking at things. Despite the good macro-economic numbers, Labour is so cocooned in its micro-management of the country that it fails to see the bigger picture. The global economy spends its time veering from one crisis to another, with the bursting of the hi-tech bubble only the latest in a series of disturbances. </p> <p>As those people in southern England who have spent the past 12 months on flood alert could testify, something weird is happening to the world's weather.

      "body": "<p>My mum's all of a tremble. \" Ooooooh! Michael Heseltine.\" She's not often impressed by interviewees. But Hezza's always had a way with the ladies. Big, broad Tarzan, with his golden mane and Palladian mansion, his fierce oratory, the 270 self-made millions, the lovely family, his 50 acres, the eight gardeners to nurse his arboretum, his butler and chauffeur, and the woman who does his toast to perfection every morning 10 minutes after he hits the morning room. Michael Heseltine has always seemed to have everything. Except the Tory leadership, of course. He will retire from politics come the next election.</p> <p>The security man at his publishing empire, Haymarket, in Hammersmith, west London, invites us into the car park when we mention we're here to see the gaffer. Which car belongs to Hezza? He points to the Jag, of course. \"But it's got a scratch on it. He's getting a new one.\"</p> <p>Haymarket is a funny old company. Hugely profitable, with its 100 smart, laminated magazines - the majority of them deadly dull corporate affairs - it's also built on the cheap. Journalists start out at Haymarket, get paid next to nothing, learn the trade, and often move on to jobs on national papers. The executives pay themselves kings' salaries. None more kingly than Heseltine. For decades he was virtually a sleeping partner, but since since 1997 he has returned full-time as chairman. Haymarket has expanded considerably, and he has seen his own fortune swell by 50 odd million.</p> <p>The building is typically Haymarket. OK on the outside, trashy and cramped on the inside. Even his top-floor office looks as if it's made of cardboard and asbestos. I've never seen such a spartan executive pad. No pictures of friends or family, no trinkets, no trophies. I ask him whether he's just moved in. He looks surprised. \"Oh no, no, no. I've been here since 1997. It's called minimalism isn't it? Hahahohoho!\"</p> <p>We stop for a photograph. The mane is no longer wild and gold. Yellow-grey and flat, but still very long. He makes love to the camera like a supermodel. There's hair sprouting everywhere these days - from the nose, the back of his shirt. Meanwhile, those extraordinary eyebrows stand at 45 degree angles like fencing swords. It is only his little boy's mouth that disappoints, with its receding lips and tiny teeth.</p> <p>It's strange that Heseltine ended up in publishing. He was mildly dyslexic as a child and says he still doesn't like reading. But he says he's always been the entrepreneur, and tells me a practised anecdote about his public school days. \"The first known example of my entrepreneurial activities is when I was 13. I wasn't any good at games, so when all these very energetic fellows spent the afternoon exhausting themselves on the soccer playing fields of Shrewsbury, I used to carry lemonade up the hill and sell it at a significant mark-up.\" He ho-ho-hos. Actually, you can see it in the early photos of the little boy. He looks rather precious and over-preened.</p> <p>There's a famous story about how at Oxford Michael Ray Dibdin Heseltine mapped out his career on the back of an envelope - Fifties: millionaire. Sixties: MP. Seventies: minister. Eighties: Cabinet. Nineties: Downing Street.</p> <p>Who would have thought that the former defence secretary, energy secretary, president of the board of trade and deputy prime minister would bow out of politics with a whimper? Does he now think of himself simply as a businessman? \"Well that is my life, that is perfectly fair. That's what I do and what I think about. Psychologically, I think I left the House of Commons in '97.\" Better not tell his constituents that. \"I think it's extremely difficult to have had the extraordinarily privileged career I've had and then go back into being in opposition. It's a young man's game, opposition. So I came back here.\" He holds his empire in his hands. \"And it's been enormously fortunate in the sense that so often people in politics . . . it's like going over a cliff. There isn't any letdown, there's a nasty bump at the bottom.\"</p> <p>Is that what Thatcher found? \"I've no idea,\" he says tersely. They can't stand each other. Never have been able to since they fell out over the Westland affair. Few people can remember, or care about, the details of the European v American helicopter row. But Heseltine does.</p> <p>I ask him why he found it so much easier to work with Major. \"Well John Major was erm erm, erm, a reasonable and decent fellow.\" His brain seems to be fighting an internal battle. \"Why I hesitated was that I don't accept, it just isn't true that I didn't find it possible to work with Mrs Thatcher. I worked with her for seven years.\"</p> <p>But in the end he couldn't work with her? \"Ah yes, well, she tried to cheat, and I won't have that. And I left. It was the most appalling waste of my life.\" She betrayed him? \"Well she tried to cheat,\" he repeats. Heseltine has an effortless sense of moral superiority. At the same time, though, he sounds like a petulant lad.</p> <p>Does he ever look back on Westland and wish he'd kept quiet? \"No, I don't . . . The whole idea that one should have kept just a little quiet over what I believed to be a scandal - the world is full of people who kept a little quiet.\"</p> <p>Thatcher did for him, and a few years later he did for her. When Heseltine challenged for the leadership, she won the vote but lost the party's confidence. She stood down. It may have been a satisfying short-term revenge for him, but she had the last laugh. Thatcher loyalists never forgave him.</p> <p>I ask him what he is most proud of in his political life. \"Oh council house sales, the defeat of CND, the final rationalisation of the Ministry of Defence, and Liverpool.\" After the riots in the 80s, he spent a deal of time in the city and devised a policy to revamp it. \"In Liverpool I had an opportunity to put into practice a philosophy I had all my political life, in other words good enlightened capitalism - paternalism if you like. Noblesse oblige. I believe strongly that those with power and privilege have responsibilities . . . what we did has now become the consensus inner city policy; a constructive partnership between the public and private sectors.\"</p> <p>The strange thing is, I say, most people will probably remember you as Tarzan swinging the mace in parliament and destroying Thatcher. He chuckles modestly. Was the mace-swinging spontaneous? \" Yeaasssss , the Labour party had cheated. They got legislation through by cheating.\" His political career seems to have been plagued by cheats.</p> <p>What does he think he will be best remembered for? \"My trees,\" he answers instantly. Heseltine loves his arboretum. He and his eight gardeners have planted 3,500 trees and shrubs over the past quarter of a century, and he spends about 20 hours a week in it. \"It's a therapy. As one walks out of the house into garden everything is left behind.\"</p> <p>Does he talk to the trees? \"Oh yes. Underperformers are very severely castigated.\" He abuses his trees? \"Oh yes, I do abuse my trees. I had a thorn tree that was very much underperforming and I had a conversation with it and I said, 'Look, the game's over, if you don't do better than this you're on the way out.' The next year it flowered like you've never seen such flowers. Absolutely covered in flowers, as if to say, well OK, sod you. It died the year after.\"</p> <p>He's looking me straight in the eye for a change, talking with animation and passion for the first time. There's no stopping him.</p> <p>Does he finds it easier to talk to the trees than to his political colleagues? \"Noooooah. No, no no, no.\" I think that's a yes. \"I mean I could never talk to people in parliament with the same rough edge of the tongue that I talk to the trees.\"</p> <p>Perhaps that was the problem. Great with the trees, but not so good at shmoozing fellow Tories. The charisma lay more in your image than soul, I suggest. And as a politician he never quite had the drive or devilry of Thatcher. \"Well you must decide on the characteristics. I'm perfectly capable of doing this gladhanding,\" he grumbles. He says he did loads of it in the 80s, charmed the pants off any number of Tories.</p> <p>But he does have the reputation of being a loner, detached? \"Yeh, yeh, that's true, that's true. I don't run away from that. I'm not good at small talk.\" Does he find it difficult to make friends? \"I have close good friends, but not many. I'm not the life and soul of the party.\"</p> <p>He insists he was always good at keeping in touch with those he worked closely with. But not very good at keeping on side with those he had to? \"Yes, yes, yes, I think that's probably right.\" There's a long pause, as he struggles with his words. \"Difficult . . . the party became very divided in the 80s. They had a view about who was 'One of us' as the phrase was, and I never was.\" The assassin sounds rather hurt.</p> <p>He must at times wish he hadn't stood against her. \"I don't have any regrets,\" he says. But it's only human to have regrets. \"I had a wonderful time, huge privilege,\" he chants. \"I cast the dice, and I knew what I was doing.\" He equates regret with failure, and he doesn't do failure.</p> <p>But he desperately wanted to be prime minister? \"I would like to have been prime minster, yes. Desperate is not the word I'd use. If I had really been that preoccupied, would I have stayed away from the House of Commons all those years?\" He says he didn't shmooze because it wasn't his way. \"But if I was this scheming monkey that everyone would like to portray me as, the fact that it wasn't my natural way wouldn't have stopped me.\" I don't think he could have been the scheming monkey either - he's too proud, and too cold.</p> <p>Anyway, these days, Heseltine wants to accentuate the positive. He is even willing to be generous about Hague - yes, slightly dodgy on Europe, but such a young man, so clever, terrific speaker, and it was only the once he supped those 14 pints. Most people, he says, think things were always better in their day, but he's not so small-minded. He smiles. Big handsome hairy Tarzan with his milk teeth.</p> <p>Someone told me that his father, an army colonel, had been called Haircut Heseltine. Is that true? He looks astonished, \"Yes, how did you discover that? No he wasn't called Haircut Heseltine. No, no. where did you get that from out of curiosity?\" Must protect my sources, I say. He's virtually pleading for the information. \"Oh yes, but it could only be someone who was a contemporary of his. Give me a clue. I think he was called Half-inch Heseltine. I think he was. Because he was meticulous about the appearance of his soldiers. And in those days everyone had short hair. And he had a big mirror put outside the barracks gates in Clitheroe in Lancashire, so his troops going in and out could see whether they were smart enough to represent the regiment.\"</p> <p>So you've spent the past 40 years rebelling against Half-inch Heseltine? \"No, no, I'm devoted to my father.\" If you push your hair forward, how far would it go, I ask. My bet is that it would hang off his chin. \"I haven't the first idea.\" Go on, try it. \"No, I shan't. I certainly won't try it.\" Go on. \"No, not at all.</p> <p>\"I didn't always want long hair. I just had long hair. There was no conscious decision.\" Come off it, hair length is a choice! \"You can have a passive choice.\" Laziness? \"Yeeeeaassss. Indifference.\" Indifference!</p> <p>Did Half-inch disapprove? \"Well I don't think, to be honest, he lived that long. I don't think I did have that long hair. I can think of pictures at Oxford when I was president of the union and I had quite short hair. My father was dead two years later.\"</p> <p>On the way out, Heseltine puts his hand out, and I don't see the man in front of me. Instead I shake hands with a little boy in shorts and a blazer with cropped blond hair.</p>",

      "body": "<p>This is a personal column, in the sense that it begins with my Spanish grandson. But it also encompasses Penelope Cruz, Time magazine, Tony Blair, John Townend and an amazing Belfast hotel owner. More of all of them in a moment.</p> <p>Meanwhile, here's Leonardo. He is two-years-and-four-months-old. He chatters away in English like any tiny, bouncy scrap. (\"That's a very big ship,\" he said gravely when we went to the Cutty Sark the other day, \"it's enormous.\") He talks Castilian Spanish almost as fluently to his dad, and Catalan with his playschool mates. When he goes to visit his paternal grandma, they speak Gallego.</p> <p>He is in no sense a Barcelona prodigy or exception. His father needs all three Spanish languages - plus a little English - to work. So does my daughter, though she throttles back a bit on the Gallego. And there goes little Leonardo, switching unthinkingly between tongues, asking me for a lollipop in English and the shop girl for the big red one in Catalan.</p> <p>What, you wonder, will he be 20 years on? Will he be what John Townend would call \"Anglo-Saxon\", welcome in some snug bar supping Yorkshire bitter? Or Castilian, Catalan, Galician? Which is where Penelope Cruz and Time magazine come in.</p> <p>Miss Cruz (from Madrid) is currently the hottest thing around Hollywood. You probably saw her looking lustrous at the Oscars. When Time, this week, runs a cover story on \"Generation Europe\" (the 21- to 35-year-olds), then of course she has to be on the cover. I'm a \"citizen of the world\", she says, \"I like to work in different languages.\" She is, interestingly, not alone. Antonio Banderas and Javier Bardem are stars on the same global movie beat as Spanish becomes the other American.</p> <p>What Time has done, via a Mori poll, is ask this generation who they are. Are you German, French, British, Italian - or are you European? And it's a balance: 31% of French, 36% of Germans, 42% of Italians say \"European\". To be sure, only 21% of young Britons say the same, but is the glass four-fifths empty or one-fifth full? Which political party, this coming election, speaks for the 21% - or even acknowledges that they exist?</p> <p>The point here, the point the British non-debate always misses, has nothing much to do with Brussels and its grey men in suits winding up the Daily Mail. There's no need to pin \"ever deeper union\" on your lapel, because what's happening is happening by osmosis, not decree, in the way young Europeans behave and think and act. They recognise their roots, their homes, their ties - but they are also citizens of a wider world. Have skills and languages: can travel. From the Ramblas to the Fulham Road and back.</p> <p>This isn't yet the mobility of labour that Tony Blair thinks so vital to what we used to call the American economic miracle (and which Gordon Brown does so little to encourage); perhaps only 2 or 3% of Generation E are on the move as yet. But there are still hundreds of thousands of them, young professionals, and their numbers swell year by year. They are one definition of the future.</p> <p>So to that Belfast hotel owner. Dr Diljit Rana MBE JP. I met him a few weeks ago on a plane from New Delhi. He had come to Britain from India in the 60s and found his way to Northern Ireland, and stayed. Was there a large Indian community in the province? No, very small. Did he like the people? Yes, very much. And religion? \"Sometimes at checkpoints they say \"Protestant or Catholic?\" and I say \"Hindu\" - and they ask \"Is that a Protestant Hindu or a Catholic Hindu?\"</p> <p>We talked, inevitably, about the peace and the non-process. I was familiarly gloomy. He was surprisingly upbeat. Why? I said. \"Because of Europe. It makes everything different.\" Look, what did \"being British\" or \"being Irish\" mean any longer?

      "bodyText": "This is a personal column, in the sense that it begins with my Spanish grandson. But it also encompasses Penelope Cruz, Time magazine, Tony Blair, John Townend and an amazing Belfast hotel owner. More of all of them in a moment. Meanwhile, here's Leonardo. He is two-years-and-four-months-old. He chatters away in English like any tiny, bouncy scrap. (\"That's a very big ship,\" he said gravely when we went to the Cutty Sark the other day, \"it's enormous.\") He talks Castilian Spanish almost as fluently to his dad, and Catalan with his playschool mates. When he goes to visit his paternal grandma, they speak Gallego. He is in no sense a Barcelona prodigy or exception. His father needs all three Spanish languages - plus a little English - to work. So does my daughter, though she throttles back a bit on the Gallego. And there goes little Leonardo, switching unthinkingly between tongues, asking me for a lollipop in English and the shop girl for the big red one in Catalan. What, you wonder, will he be 20 years on? Will he be what John Townend would call \"Anglo-Saxon\", welcome in some snug bar supping Yorkshire bitter? Or Castilian, Catalan, Galician? Which is where Penelope Cruz and Time magazine come in. Miss Cruz (from Madrid) is currently the hottest thing around Hollywood. You probably saw her looking lustrous at the Oscars. When Time, this week, runs a cover story on \"Generation Europe\" (the 21- to 35-year-olds), then of course she has to be on the cover. I'm a \"citizen of the world\", she says, \"I like to work in different languages.\" She is, interestingly, not alone. Antonio Banderas and Javier Bardem are stars on the same global movie beat as Spanish becomes the other American. What Time has done, via a Mori poll, is ask this generation who they are. Are you German, French, British, Italian - or are you European? And it's a balance: 31% of French, 36% of Germans, 42% of Italians say \"European\". To be sure, only 21% of young Britons say the same, but is the glass four-fifths empty or one-fifth full? Which political party, this coming election, speaks for the 21% - or even acknowledges that they exist? The point here, the point the British non-debate always misses, has nothing much to do with Brussels and its grey men in suits winding up the Daily Mail. There's no need to pin \"ever deeper union\" on your lapel, because what's happening is happening by osmosis, not decree, in the way young Europeans behave and think and act. They recognise their roots, their homes, their ties - but they are also citizens of a wider world. Have skills and languages: can travel. From the Ramblas to the Fulham Road and back. This isn't yet the mobility of labour that Tony Blair thinks so vital to what we used to call the American economic miracle (and which Gordon Brown does so little to encourage); perhaps only 2 or 3% of Generation E are on the move as yet. But there are still hundreds of thousands of them, young professionals, and their numbers swell year by year. They are one definition of the future. So to that Belfast hotel owner. Dr Diljit Rana MBE JP. I met him a few weeks ago on a plane from New Delhi. He had come to Britain from India in the 60s and found his way to Northern Ireland, and stayed. Was there a large Indian community in the province? No, very small. Did he like the people? Yes, very much. And religion? \"Sometimes at checkpoints they say \"Protestant or Catholic?\" and I say \"Hindu\" - and they ask \"Is that a Protestant Hindu or a Catholic Hindu?\" We talked, inevitably, about the peace and the non-process. I was familiarly gloomy. He was surprisingly upbeat. Why? I said. \"Because of Europe. It makes everything different.\" Look, what did \"being British\" or \"being Irish\" mean any longer? It didn't mean wafting off into some nationalist sunset, proud and alone. It meant sitting together in the same Brussels committee rooms, sharing the same open borders, the same jobs, observing the same rules and regulations. And because they, who would see the peace process through, knew this, they also knew they must settle for less - because the absolutes of the struggle had perished. Score one for a wise, tolerant Hindu: a Generation E founder member three decades back. While Penelope Cruz sends money she earns to charities in Calcutta, Diljit Rana earns his money in Belfast. They are part of the same future, and they deserve to be heard. It will, I guess, be a thoroughly depressing election. William Hague will bang on about asylum hordes from eastern Europe arriving to drink our bitter. Jack Straw will offer to lock them up more securely or dump them off Calais.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has ordered government departments to fill April with eye-catching announcements, in a bid to show the government is not in limbo or the victim of events. A full grid of announcements was drafted last week across Whitehall for the next seven days as a precaution against the prime minister delaying the general election from May 3 to June 7. However, ministers and Millbank will be scrambling to fill April, and are likely to bring forward initiatives that had been destined for the campaign itself. Moreover, the decision to prolong the pre-election period will require a big psychological shift in Whitehall which had long been working on the assumption of a May 3 election. It has even been reported that David Blunkett, the education secretary, had hosted what amounted to a farewell drinks party for his civil servants last week. Another education minister last week was gasping for May, saying the budget had run out of cash for further announcements. Other ministers, such as Peter Hain (industry), had rushed forward as much cash as possible to placate the families of miners still waiting compensation for ill-health from the government. A third minister claimed there had been an end of term spirit inside the private offices of many ministers with talk of holidays and campaign trails. Although ministers remain ministers during a general election campaign, they in practice do little governing. Whitehall civil servants go on holiday, or enjoy a slower pace. However, the precaution of preparing the usual announcement grid for the coming week will mean civil service need not return to work today in search of ditched, delayed or incomplete announcements. Ministers, for instance, will try to give a \"business as usual\" feel by making announcements on the future of Railtrack and drug rehabilitation, as well as on the science budget. Other announcements had been postponed anyway because of the media dominance by the foot and mouth outbreak. Nevertheless, the carefully crafted slow build-up to the election launch has been damaged. The budget has been published and most of the big benefit increases will go into voters' pockets this week, earlier than Gordon Brown, the chancellor, would have wanted for in terms of a June election. Ministers had already published green papers setting out plans for the future of criminal justice, the health service, education, transport, adult skills, and the future of the new deal. The situation leaves the government in danger of treading water in April. But April could be a politically cruel month for the government. There are controversial reviews due shortly from the Home Office - one on the future of criminal sentencing and another on the future of the court system. The deadline for decommissioning in the Northern Ireland peace process is June, putting extra pressure on ministers to prove the IRA is acting in good faith. The unemployment, new deal and inflation figures should remain buoyant. However, if the tourist industry is hit as hard as some predict, Britain could be pushed towards far slower growth than expected. Hotel bookings were down 7% in London last week, and Easter generally represents 10% of the tourist trade. Two further interest rate decisions from the Bank of England are due before June 7, including one on June 6. Big summits also loom for the G8 and for the EU in June, including a possible clash with George Bush over Kyoto. Sleaze will continue to raise its head. Keith Vaz, the Foreign Office minister, has retired from the front line of politics for eight weeks after his collapse. But Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, will continue with her inquiry into further aspects of his finances. She will also start to pursue aspects of Geoffrey Robinson's business empire after the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, gave the go ahead for her to seek information from Arthur Andersen.",

Sometime this week, the number of livestock earmarked for slaughter will pass the seven figure mark as foot and mouth tightens its grip on the countryside. For Millbank strategists, however, the number was meant to symbolise another milestone - the news last month that unemployment had dropped below 1m for first time in 25 years. Now economists fear the job losses from foot and mouth may send unemployment back above the million mark. The foundations of Labour's carefully crafted election strategy - Gordon Brown's successful handling of the economy - are looking increasingly vulnerable. City forecasters at first were inclined to dismiss the economic impact of foot and mouth. Although lost sales are costing farmers around \u00a350m a week, agriculture today is a tiny part of the economy - 1.2% of output - and livestock farming makes up just a third of that. If the crisis were to wipe out livestock and dairy farming, the rest of the economy would feel the impact but would not be thrown into recession. But what the first forecasts missed was the damage being inflicted on other parts of the economy by the virtual shutdown of large parts of the countryside.

Hotels and resorts are already cutting jobs, raising a nightmare possibility for the government. By mid-May when the April unemployment figures are published, the jobless total may have crept back above the 1m figure. The crisis is also expected to increase Britain's trade gap with rest of the world, which is already the widest since records began 300 years ago. Again the hit on tourism is the main reason - livestock exports accounted for just \u00a3615m last year - just under half a percent of total exports. Tourism, though, is a big earner: foreign visitors spent about \u00a313bn in Britain last year. Not only are foreigners cancelling trips, but UK residents are also choosing to take holidays abroad rather than at home, which increases the trade deficit. When Labour strategists long ago pencilled in May 2001 as their preferred election date, no one foresaw that a global recession would be clouding the horizon. The US and Japan, the world's number one and num ber two economies, are in deep trouble, and big European and American companies are announcing layoffs daily. A recent analysis suggested that the epidemic and the global slide into recession could shave 1% off growth this year, the equivalent of \u00a39bn in lost output. However, most City analysts think this estimate is too high. Not all the losses the tourist industry is suffering are a direct cost to the economy - people are diverting spending to other leisure industries such as bookshops and shopping. And some businesses are making money cleaning up after the epidemic: the government has spent \u00a3100m on disinfecting the affected farms and abattoirs, and \u00a340m on lorries and transport. Luckily for the chancellor, the economy was in robust health before the epidemic started and the slowdown will only really start to bite in the autumn, after the likely election date in June.",

      "bodyText": "45 Minutes the cult BBC football show that revealed Les Ferdinand's involvement in the infamous trashing of the Blue Peter garden. The show made national headlines when spurs star Ferdinand revealed in an interview that as a 15-year-old he had helped his mates get over the wall before the notorious incident, which took place in 1983. But now Stuart Murphy, controller of BBC Choice, has decided to call time. He has dropped the show - which aimed to bring a more celebrity-driven, showbiz approach to coverage of football - after just two series. Instead, Liquid News, BBC Choice's showbiz news show, will cover more sport as part of its brief. \"BBC Sport will continue to look to make a wider range of programmes, bringing sport and entertainment together in new formats,\" said a BBC Choice spokesman. \"We will be widening the scope of Liquid News to cover sport and its interaction with the world of entertainment.\" \"A new daily strand is planned to give new focus to sport on the channel, including the celebrity side and news issues.\" 45 Minutes was presented by former Big Breakfast host Lisa Rogers and Joe Mace, while Shovell, the M People drummer, interviewed the footballers. The show attracted a procession of big-name soccer stars, including Edgar Davids and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. As well as solving the 17-year-old mystery of who trashed the Blue Peter garden, 45 Minutes's other scoops included getting Frank Lampard to reveal that his West Ham team-mate Paolo Di Canio shaves his entire body in the shower after training. But the show will not be missed by other members of the BBC Sport department. Mr Murphy gave the producers of 45 Minutes licence to throw far more money at football stars than other programmes were allowed. The axing of 45 Minutes comes as Mr Murphy is preparing to change the mix of programming on BBC Choice as it transforms into the youth-orientated BBC3.",

Players can simply play by keying in their seven numbers and sending them to a special lottery telephone number. The company behind the novel venture is expecting the game will be a huge hit with younger players, cutting out the trip to a newsagent for lottery tickets. Daily prizes of \u00a350,000 will be up for grabs with smaller pay outs also expected. SpotFlash, the company behind the service, is drafting in sponsors to help out with costs for its ZagLotto service. \"It will work like the lottery - with rollovers - so it's hard to say how many payments we may have to make. It all depends on how many people enter,\" said Bill Green, chief executive officer of the company. The lottery is the second service from SpotFlash. It recently introduced ZagMe, a shopping centre experiment that sent teenagers text messages giving them details of special offers. The service has already been launched at the Lakeside and Bluewater shopping centres and has been such a success it is being expanded. More than 50,000 people signed up to the ZagMe trials, giving SpotFlash access to an estimated 20% of the under-25s that visit the two shopping centres. This was double the number the company had expected. Unsurprisingly, 18 to 24-year-olds were the heaviest users, 25 to 34-year-olds were the biggest spenders and sports goods carried the highest transaction value.

Social democrats ought to spend their waking hours thinking of ways in which the power of the state can be harnessed to national improvement and the pursuit of social justice. To govern is to legislate. Yet from mid-January until, it now appears, mid-June there will have been little or no effective policy-making. Within 48 hours Mr Blair must put us out of our misery. We have given up on dancing round the Maypole. Mustering enthusiasm for a canter round a June poll is not going to be easy.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair is not a man to make a decision before he feels politically compelled to, but in the case of the May 3 election he must have felt like a man prematurely committed. For weeks he and his aides had insisted any delay in the council elections would send a desperate message to overseas visitors and cripple the British tourist industry.</p> <p>The Sun, on the personal advice of Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair's press secretary, had reported that May 3 was the official election date - news that was a present from Downing Street to the paper for its backing of Labour. The Sun in turn praised Mr Blair for sticking to his guns.</p> <p>Yet privately there had always been more doubts that the foot and mouth epidemic might destroy the planning. By Thursday Mr Blair, Mr Campbell and the inner circle had come to believe delay was unavoidable.</p> <p>The final decision appears to have been made by Mr Blair on Friday, when the news started to seep through the higher echelons of the party. The prime minister's decision was resolved after meetings with farmers in Dumfries and Galloway. Cabinet members were not individually told until Saturday, by phone by Mr Blair.</p> <p><b> Straining at the leash </b><br></p> <p>Many of the big figures in the cabinet and at the party's headquarters at Millbank had favoured May, but with one or two exceptions everyone accepted the final judgment on date to be finely balanced. The only proviso was that if Mr Blair plumped for June there could be no further slippage - he would not only look weak but be prey to rightwing interests.</p> <p>One ministerial source said: \"It would be wrong to characterise this as a united cabinet defied by the prime minister. We all have the same political instincts and are subject to the same pressures as [Mr Blair]. A lot of people were shifting last week to June and ultimately everyone accepted that anyway this was a decision for the prime minister.\"</p> <p>The first indications of a serious wobble came on Thursday when Mr Blair met the chancellor Gordon Brown - who is also the party election coordinator - after some gruelling meetings with the National Farmers' Union. He also had a meeting with his inner circle, which included Pat MacFadden, Anji Hunter, Mr Campbell and his pollster Philip Gould.</p> <p>Mr Brown, like John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, had favoured May. Close to the Millbank machine, Mr Prescott and Mr Brown were straining at the leash.</p> <p>But Mr Blair felt that the Ministry of Agriculture figures were showing no clear sign that the foot and mouth epidemic could be credibly described as under control. New cases were running at 40 a day, requiring the culling not just of these animals but those on neighbouring farms. The logistical exercise was massive. <br><br>In Cumbria the proposed 24 hours target from detection of the virus to slaughter was nowhere near being met and the number of animals to be buried was rising. Protests were rising over plans to open up new burial sites. And the farmers' union could not be persuaded to vaccinate dairy cattle in Cumbria. <br><br>Mr Blair feared he could not credibly promise to make foot and mouth his top priority, then call an election. In conversation with cabinet ministers he set out the case for delay, including his belief that he did not want to win the election on the basis of a split in the country and bitter arguments over the campaign's timing.</p> <p>One cabinet source said Mr Blair seemed to see himself not just as a one nation leader but almost as father to the nation.</p> <p>Mr Blair was strongly supported at that time by some of his closest Downing Street confidantes, including the Cabinet Office minister Lord Falconer, his personal assistant Ms Hunter, and Mr Gould.</p> <p>According to Mr Gould, 25 seats were likely to be lost due to public anger if the poll occurred in May; he felt strengthened by his own private poll for the party last weekend and the Mori poll in the Times showing a rock solid 18-19 point lead that was unlikely to evaporate. A Telegraph poll at the weekend confirmed the view at Downing Street that the public opposed an early poll. The Gallup poll showed 13% thought that in a May poll they would be less likely to vote Labour.</p> <p>Throughout, Blair was canvassing opinion. Supposedly in exile, Peter Mandelson, the former Northern Ireland secretary, had persistently advised Mr Blair of the necessity of delay to make a credible one nation appeal. However some cabinet members, including Alan Milburn, the health secretary, also favoured June, warning that the first two weeks of the election would be about foot and mouth rather than Labour's agenda of jobs, public services and the Tory threat.</p> <p><b> Knife-edge decision </b><br></p> <p>Mr Milburn was sure that delay from May did not raise the threat of being knocked off course in June. David Blunkett, the education secretary, favoured May but told Blair it was a knife-edge decision. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, wanted May but by the end of the week had swung to June. Jack Straw, the home secretary, was for May but in the past few days realised the virtue of delay. He did not see a practical case against May - such as rural areas being unable to vote - but accepted the case for sensitivity.</p> <p>The strongest opposition came from Mr Prescott and Mr Brown, the two most closely associated with the Millbank campaign machine. Mr Prescott's people on Wednesday claimed no one favoured June. But neither of these men fought Mr Blair to the death over it. <br><br>On Thursday Mr Brown met his closest electoral advisers in a private room at a Soho restaurant - some present, including advisers linked to US Democrats, warned that the first two weeks would be dominated by the foot and mouth outbreak. Those who wanted to press ahead pointed out that only the rightwing press, the farmers and the Tories championed delay. Less than 1% of farms had suffered an outbreak of the disease. One cabinet member even blamed the BBC, saying it was \"run by youngsters running a vegetarian agenda; the coverage ... totally out of proportion\".</p> <p>The party general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, advised that Labour had set aside millions for poster spending in April linked to good economic news, and these billboards could not be cancelled. Equally the party and unions had published a lot of election literature. The GMB union had printed 500,000 leaflets - but little, or none of it, said \"Vote Labour on May 3\".</p> <p>The prime minister knows his decision is not one by which he is likely to benefit partywise. Whatever the result on June 7 there will be voices claiming that if he had gone earlier he would saved more seats.</p> <p>Doubtless by now he will be seeing the great virtue of fixed term parliaments.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br></p> <p><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463602,00.html\">26.03.2001: Countrytown blues</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465571,00.html\">30.03.2001: No vaccination, cattle farmers tell Blair</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465569,00.html\">30.03.2001: How the brigadier has mopped up chaos and won farmers' support</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465572,00.html\">30.03.2001: Organic farmer wins court battle over slaughter policy</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465565,00.html\">30.03.2001: Euthanasia drug supplies running out</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464774,00.html\">29.03.2001, George Monbiot: Foot and mouth is a good thing</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464259,00.html\">28.03.2001: On the farm</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463596,00.html\">11.11.1967: Emigrant flights to Australia stopped by foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463559,00.html\">01.11.1967: It is cheaper to kill than to prevent cattle disease</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is not a man to make a decision before he feels politically compelled to, but in the case of the May 3 election he must have felt like a man prematurely committed. For weeks he and his aides had insisted any delay in the council elections would send a desperate message to overseas visitors and cripple the British tourist industry. The Sun, on the personal advice of Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair's press secretary, had reported that May 3 was the official election date - news that was a present from Downing Street to the paper for its backing of Labour. The Sun in turn praised Mr Blair for sticking to his guns. Yet privately there had always been more doubts that the foot and mouth epidemic might destroy the planning. By Thursday Mr Blair, Mr Campbell and the inner circle had come to believe delay was unavoidable. The final decision appears to have been made by Mr Blair on Friday, when the news started to seep through the higher echelons of the party. The prime minister's decision was resolved after meetings with farmers in Dumfries and Galloway. Cabinet members were not individually told until Saturday, by phone by Mr Blair. Straining at the leash Many of the big figures in the cabinet and at the party's headquarters at Millbank had favoured May, but with one or two exceptions everyone accepted the final judgment on date to be finely balanced. The only proviso was that if Mr Blair plumped for June there could be no further slippage - he would not only look weak but be prey to rightwing interests. One ministerial source said: \"It would be wrong to characterise this as a united cabinet defied by the prime minister. We all have the same political instincts and are subject to the same pressures as [Mr Blair]. A lot of people were shifting last week to June and ultimately everyone accepted that anyway this was a decision for the prime minister.\" The first indications of a serious wobble came on Thursday when Mr Blair met the chancellor Gordon Brown - who is also the party election coordinator - after some gruelling meetings with the National Farmers' Union. He also had a meeting with his inner circle, which included Pat MacFadden, Anji Hunter, Mr Campbell and his pollster Philip Gould. Mr Brown, like John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, had favoured May. Close to the Millbank machine, Mr Prescott and Mr Brown were straining at the leash. But Mr Blair felt that the Ministry of Agriculture figures were showing no clear sign that the foot and mouth epidemic could be credibly described as under control. New cases were running at 40 a day, requiring the culling not just of these animals but those on neighbouring farms. The logistical exercise was massive. In Cumbria the proposed 24 hours target from detection of the virus to slaughter was nowhere near being met and the number of animals to be buried was rising. Protests were rising over plans to open up new burial sites. And the farmers' union could not be persuaded to vaccinate dairy cattle in Cumbria. Mr Blair feared he could not credibly promise to make foot and mouth his top priority, then call an election. In conversation with cabinet ministers he set out the case for delay, including his belief that he did not want to win the election on the basis of a split in the country and bitter arguments over the campaign's timing. One cabinet source said Mr Blair seemed to see himself not just as a one nation leader but almost as father to the nation. Mr Blair was strongly supported at that time by some of his closest Downing Street confidantes, including the Cabinet Office minister Lord Falconer, his personal assistant Ms Hunter, and Mr Gould. According to Mr Gould, 25 seats were likely to be lost due to public anger if the poll occurred in May; he felt strengthened by his own private poll for the party last weekend and the Mori poll in the Times showing a rock solid 18-19 point lead that was unlikely to evaporate. A Telegraph poll at the weekend confirmed the view at Downing Street that the public opposed an early poll. The Gallup poll showed 13% thought that in a May poll they would be less likely to vote Labour. Throughout, Blair was canvassing opinion. Supposedly in exile, Peter Mandelson, the former Northern Ireland secretary, had persistently advised Mr Blair of the necessity of delay to make a credible one nation appeal. However some cabinet members, including Alan Milburn, the health secretary, also favoured June, warning that the first two weeks of the election would be about foot and mouth rather than Labour's agenda of jobs, public services and the Tory threat. Knife-edge decision Mr Milburn was sure that delay from May did not raise the threat of being knocked off course in June. David Blunkett, the education secretary, favoured May but told Blair it was a knife-edge decision. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, wanted May but by the end of the week had swung to June. Jack Straw, the home secretary, was for May but in the past few days realised the virtue of delay. He did not see a practical case against May - such as rural areas being unable to vote - but accepted the case for sensitivity. The strongest opposition came from Mr Prescott and Mr Brown, the two most closely associated with the Millbank campaign machine. Mr Prescott's people on Wednesday claimed no one favoured June. But neither of these men fought Mr Blair to the death over it. On Thursday Mr Brown met his closest electoral advisers in a private room at a Soho restaurant - some present, including advisers linked to US Democrats, warned that the first two weeks would be dominated by the foot and mouth outbreak. Those who wanted to press ahead pointed out that only the rightwing press, the farmers and the Tories championed delay. Less than 1% of farms had suffered an outbreak of the disease. One cabinet member even blamed the BBC, saying it was \"run by youngsters running a vegetarian agenda; the coverage ... totally out of proportion\". The party general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, advised that Labour had set aside millions for poster spending in April linked to good economic news, and these billboards could not be cancelled. Equally the party and unions had published a lot of election literature. The GMB union had printed 500,000 leaflets - but little, or none of it, said \"Vote Labour on May 3\". The prime minister knows his decision is not one by which he is likely to benefit partywise. Whatever the result on June 7 there will be voices claiming that if he had gone earlier he would saved more seats. Doubtless by now he will be seeing the great virtue of fixed term parliaments.

But, as with the fuel protest, Blair will today again look like a leader who is more concerned to appease his natural enemies than reward his friends, more concerned to listen to his unelected kitchen cabinet - Philip Gould, the Eeyore of pollsters, is likely to have had a hand in this - than to his elected cabinet colleagues.</p> <p>Delay must have irritated the Sun, but has it pleased the Daily Mail?

      "body": "<p>From beneath his familiar black fedora Kenneth Clarke ventured a cheerful mid-week prediction about the date of the general election. \"It's decision time for Tony Blair, isn't it? And he's not very good at taking decisions.\"</p> <p>So would the election be on May 3 or June 7? \"He'd be mad to postpone it,\" said Clarke without a moment's hesitation. I thought that too. So did the Labour MP who excitedly reported that he'd just seen General Sir Mike Jackson on TV - in camouflage and red beret - taking on all those unarmed cattle.</p> <p>\"That means it must be May 3,\" the MP explained. Until they read Saturday morning's Sun - New Labour's equivalent of the Official Gazette - most cabinet ministers thought so too, though those with long memories will remember that 10 days earlier the Sun had said with equally self-important certainty that it would not be June. The editor had virtually been to the Palace to tell the Queen. Equally unembarrassable, ministers have also been coming round fast since learning that the prime minister had changed his mind at the end of a week of intermittent wobbling. The party machine at Millbank - and in the constituencies - will be less easily placated.</p> <p>This was not an aircraft taxiing down the runway, only to be called back by air traffic control. The election plane was airborne somewhere over the Irish Sea when the drinks were spilled in first class and the peanuts scattered in economy on Friday night. The result: an emergency landing, burned rubber, money leaking like fuel, adrenalin gone to waste. And for what, activists and officials will be asking each other today when postponement of the county council elections obliquely confirms the larger delay.</p> <p>To appease the farmers who don't like Labour anyway ? To impress the Countryside Alliance and the editor of the Daily Telegraph, who don't vote for Blair either? To please the bishops whom Mrs Thatcher spent 11 largely-successful years taking no notice of whatsoever?</p> <p>I must admit I had a wobble myself long before Downing Street appeared to cotton on to just how grim things were in much of the countryside. It would obviously be logistically possible to stage the elections. Telephone canvassing, postal votes, Millbank had all the answers. But would it be appropriate amid so much rural distress? Or a bit like going to a party straight after granny's funeral?</p> <p>It did not take much to unwobble me. As the scale of the traffic in infected animals emerged from the agri-economy and the logistics of slaughter/burial/vaccination loomed ever larger, it became obvious that Britain will not be out of this crisis in a hurry. Certainly not by June 7, this year or next.</p> <p>To make matters worse it was, pre-Milosevic, a slow news month. As the story was spread around the world by our efficient (and hysterical) media, the growing damage to tourism - a far more important industry by any test - could only be compounded by delay. Americans already think our feet and hands are dropping off.</p> <p>So, delay will benefit no one and may add to the financial burdens in already hard-pressed regions. With lanes closed and hungry sheep on the Ridgeway, prosperous west Berkshire looked disease-free but quietly miserable yesterday. Cumbria - and it is mainly Cumbria - must be awful. But not many of us live or work there. Life goes on, except in Whitehall where the decision-making process, never hyperactive, remains grid-locked until the election is won or lost.</p> <p>There is also the question of will. If Mr Blair is seen in four weeks' time to have got on top of the crisis and earned well-deserved plaudits after an admittedly slow start, he may well claim to have \"put country before party\" and re-earned his laurels as a One Nation leader. A handsome second term majority will be his just reward. That is what cabinet loyalists say. \"Tony's great strength is his One Nation instinct,\" says one of the pro-June 7 minority. \"The decision will undermine the claims that Labour is anti-countryside. It will also make it awkward for William Hague to conduct an election campaign over the next 10 weeks after what he's said.\"</p> <p>That is the sort of upbeat spin I expect Alastair Campbell to put on events when he feeds the vultures at this morning's 11 o'clock briefing in the basement of No 10, albeit, I suspect, with more enthusiasm than he privately feels. Yet the same result could have been achieved by Blair devoting the first half of the campaign - until after Easter - to the rural crisis, leaving the vulgar electioneering to Gordon Brown. He would not have minded!</p> <p>As things stand, Blair-bashers, Ken Clarke for instance, will crow that the prime minister has again been pushed off course by his own lack of inner certainty and belief, or by his desire to be liked. \"The minute you say 'Why don't the electorate love us?' you're on the road to ruin,\" a senior No 10 adviser admitted recently.</p> <p>Quite. Yet the chancellor's March 7 budget quietly paid \u00a31.9bn worth of Danegeld to the road protest lobby, despite the No Surrender rhetoric. Sensible politics in the circumstances, and it was good to see the Daily Mail advocating European tax harmonisation on fuel duties. But, as with the fuel protest, Blair will today again look like a leader who is more concerned to appease his natural enemies than reward his friends, more concerned to listen to his unelected kitchen cabinet - Philip Gould, the Eeyore of pollsters, is likely to have had a hand in this - than to his elected cabinet colleagues.</p> <p>Delay must have irritated the Sun, but has it pleased the Daily Mail? We shall see. There remains the niggling doubt that this delay has something to do with our muddled sentimentality towards animals, whom we seem happy to battery-farm and kill in huge numbers provided no one reminds us what is happening.</p> <p>So, in these sentimental and credulous times, we weep for both lambs and foxes, but not for steel workers. And Mr Blair is a man of his time, more so perhaps than the rational Ken Clarke.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:michael.white@theguardian.com\">michael.white@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br></p> <p><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463602,00.html\">26.03.2001: Countrytown blues</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465571,00.html\">30.03.2001: No vaccination, cattle farmers tell Blair</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465569,00.html\">30.03.2001: How the brigadier has mopped up chaos and won farmers' support</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465572,00.html\">30.03.2001: Organic farmer wins court battle over slaughter policy</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,465565,00.html\">30.03.2001: Euthanasia drug supplies running out</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464774,00.html\">29.03.2001, George Monbiot: Foot and mouth is a good thing</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,464259,00.html\">28.03.2001: On the farm</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463596,00.html\">11.11.1967: Emigrant flights to Australia stopped by foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463559,00.html\">01.11.1967: It is cheaper to kill than to prevent cattle disease</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

As the story was spread around the world by our efficient (and hysterical) media, the growing damage to tourism - a far more important industry by any test - could only be compounded by delay. Americans already think our feet and hands are dropping off. So, delay will benefit no one and may add to the financial burdens in already hard-pressed regions. With lanes closed and hungry sheep on the Ridgeway, prosperous west Berkshire looked disease-free but quietly miserable yesterday. Cumbria - and it is mainly Cumbria - must be awful. But not many of us live or work there. Life goes on, except in Whitehall where the decision-making process, never hyperactive, remains grid-locked until the election is won or lost. There is also the question of will. If Mr Blair is seen in four weeks' time to have got on top of the crisis and earned well-deserved plaudits after an admittedly slow start, he may well claim to have \"put country before party\" and re-earned his laurels as a One Nation leader. A handsome second term majority will be his just reward. That is what cabinet loyalists say. \"Tony's great strength is his One Nation instinct,\" says one of the pro-June 7 minority. \"The decision will undermine the claims that Labour is anti-countryside. It will also make it awkward for William Hague to conduct an election campaign over the next 10 weeks after what he's said.\" That is the sort of upbeat spin I expect Alastair Campbell to put on events when he feeds the vultures at this morning's 11 o'clock briefing in the basement of No 10, albeit, I suspect, with more enthusiasm than he privately feels. Yet the same result could have been achieved by Blair devoting the first half of the campaign - until after Easter - to the rural crisis, leaving the vulgar electioneering to Gordon Brown. He would not have minded! As things stand, Blair-bashers, Ken Clarke for instance, will crow that the prime minister has again been pushed off course by his own lack of inner certainty and belief, or by his desire to be liked. \"The minute you say 'Why don't the electorate love us?' you're on the road to ruin,\" a senior No 10 adviser admitted recently. Quite. Yet the chancellor's March 7 budget quietly paid \u00a31.9bn worth of Danegeld to the road protest lobby, despite the No Surrender rhetoric. Sensible politics in the circumstances, and it was good to see the Daily Mail advocating European tax harmonisation on fuel duties. But, as with the fuel protest, Blair will today again look like a leader who is more concerned to appease his natural enemies than reward his friends, more concerned to listen to his unelected kitchen cabinet - Philip Gould, the Eeyore of pollsters, is likely to have had a hand in this - than to his elected cabinet colleagues. Delay must have irritated the Sun, but has it pleased the Daily Mail? We shall see. There remains the niggling doubt that this delay has something to do with our muddled sentimentality towards animals, whom we seem happy to battery-farm and kill in huge numbers provided no one reminds us what is happening. So, in these sentimental and credulous times, we weep for both lambs and foxes, but not for steel workers. And Mr Blair is a man of his time, more so perhaps than the rational Ken Clarke. michael.white@theguardian.com Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

      "bodyText": "ITN has had its wrists slapped by the Radio Authority after it recycled material from its TV news channel and used it on the News Direct radio station. In its quarterly programme and advertising bulletin, the Radio Authority has given ITN a yellow card. A spokeswoman said the authority was concerned about the amount of national and international news from ITN's News Channel being broadcast on News Direct 97.3FM, which is licensed as a London-based station. The Radio Authority was concerned that News Direct 97.3FM was failing to provide a high enough level of news coverage relevant to London, a spokeswoman confirmed. The spokeswoman said there were also \"technical problems\" with the sound quality broadcast over the radio. She said parts of the soundtrack had been lifted straight from ITN's News Channel TV station without any adaptation for radio. In some cases, references were made that were irrelevant on the radio. \"In some cases, news bulletins indicated things visually that were not audible over the radio,\" she said. The warning follows reports earlier in the year that ITN was forced to tone down a revamp of the station's output after objections from the Radio Authority. ITN is understood to have abandoned plans to stream all its overnight radio material from News Channel in the wake of the Radio Authority's objections. \"We had some technical difficulties after the relaunch of ITN News Direct but these were resolved some weeks ago,\" said an ITN spokesman. He added that the Radio Authority had allowed some selective reuse of television material. The Radio Authority said it was confident the problem would be resolved after discussions with ITN.",

The Smash Hits poll winners party has been running for more than ten years. It is \"the most important event in the UK pop music calendar\", according to Trevor Dann, Emap Performance's managing director of pop, who joined last year from the BBC. The awards show will be shown on Channel 4's youth strand T4 and will undergo a major overhaul. T4 commissioning editor Jo Wallace said the collaboration was \"an extraordinary opportunity to build on this reputation and give T4 viewers this year's hottest pop ticket\". The TV show is to be produced by Done and Dusted, the music production venture that emerged from the ashes of the doomed music portal Switch2. The deal is the culmination of an agreement signed early last year between Emap and Channel 4, which has so far failed to generate any significant successes. Emap last week slashed jobs across its digital operations and Channel 4's joint venture Slam is thought to be under review.",

The show, he says straight-faced, is ripe for interactivity. A demonstration on his laptop shrinks the broadcast stream to a quarter of the screen and a series of options appear. </p> <p>The mock-up includes voting on contestants online, betting on who will crack first, profiles of the players and the \"island shop\" - although what that might sell is a little bewildering. BSkyB is holding talks with the producers of the show which could see these ideas becoming reality in the coming months. </p> <p>Rudder, 42, took the newly created job of director of interactive broadcasting at BSkyB at the end of last year to exploit the opportunities provided by digital television. Apart from a brief spell in Sydney in the mid-90s, he is a BSkyB lifer, joining at launch in 1988. </p> <p>\"It is hard not to sound cocky about what Sky is doing with interactivity,\" he says in a broad Australian accent. \"Other platforms may argue that they are superior or that they are better suited for interactivity, but where the hell are they and what are they doing? Show us.\" </p> <p>The broadcaster has made interactivity a key priority in the coming year. Partly for \"stickiness\", to keep churn figures for Sky Digital low at a time when the cable industry is finally showing signs of getting its act together. </p> <p>But there is also a more black-and-white commercial rationale. At the company's financial results presentation in February, chief executive Tony Ball outlined ambitious targets to increase the average revenue per subscriber from the current \u00a3286 to \u00a3400 a year by 2005. Of that increase, Ball expects almost half to come from new interactive services. \"We have had a big growth period. Now we have to show where the money is,\" he said. Temptation Island would include a slice of revenues from the shop and the premium rate line used for voting. </p> <p>A look back to some of the services launched in the past two years and at some of the corporate deals shows that BSkyB has been putting the blocks in place for some time. Sky Sports Active has demonstrated the appetite for viewers to interact with their televisions - around 40% of subscribers watch football using the enhanced service which gives text information and allows camera angle choice. Sky News Active was the second to launch, again combining text and broadcast, enabling viewers to dip in to video streamed headlines, entertainment, sports or business news. </p> <p>On the corporate side, BSkyB bought Surrey Sports Group to begin offering online betting. But perhaps the most significant step change has been the integration of Open, the successful retail service which BSkyB now has full control of. The integration has presented Rudder with a large resource of technical expertise while the robust systems in place for Open will allow secure e-commerce (or t-commerce to use the proper term) across the Sky Digital platform. </p> <p>Crucially, taking control of Open also removed a no-competition clause which was hampering BSkyB from offering interactive services such as shopping or online betting on its other channels. </p> <p>\"It's about creating a close relationship with the viewer,\" Rudder says. \"Once you have that relationship, the monetising is pretty predictable stuff. You will find opportunities all the way through. The content, to use a cliche, is king. Get that right and the rest will follow.\" </p> <p> The latest service is Sky Movies Active which will launch next month and which has a far clearer commercial application. The service will replace an existing preview channel and has eight rolling video broadcasts on screen. </p> <p>Each screen is running on five minute loops with interviews and details on how a film coming up on one of Sky's movie channels was made. The viewer can enter into any of the streams which also brings up text services such as profiles of the film's stars. </p> <p>The service will use a lot of the functionality provided by Open such as offering the chance to buy soundtrack CDs, DVDs or cinema tickets. Because the Open system has been made robust enough for retail, credit card details are held on the system. Email, which previously sat on the Open system, is now being deployed across the Sky Digital platform and viewers can post their reviews. </p> <p>There are also opportunities to enter competitions using premium rate lines without leaving the broadcast stream. \"We are trying to use the resources at Open and to drive them back into the content on our broadcast channels. We are maximising the value of our assets,\" Rudder says. </p> <p>Part of Rudder's job is to bring together all the interactive elements introduced by BSkyB over the past couple of years into a single style, feel and architecture. His mantra, to which he continually returns, is to make it easy for the viewer. </p> <p>In Sports Active that means pulling email, shopping, betting, news and profiles together from the different parts of the Sky Digital platform to a bar which appears on-screen. The bar would also offer promotions for future pay-per-view events which can be easily booked. </p> <p>That also means negotiating with other channels carried on the Sky Digital platform to try and set a standard for how interactivity works. The red button on the remote, for instance, is now used by others including the BBC as the standard means of moving into interactive services. </p> <p>The key for Rudder, however, is simply to create better TV. \"It's all about creating a community. It's not just about flogging product, you need more than that. We are trying to distinguish Sky as a platform. In 1998 when we launched Sports Active there was no obvious revenue stream, it was about trying to differentiate the platform. We spent \u00a31.1bn for the Premier League football rights and by law have to sell them to other platforms so it is important that you offer something else. If you reduce churn by just 1%, you've made a big difference.\" </p> <p>For the news service, the revenues are even less obvious although it uses just a sixth of the bandwidth taken up by sport. \"We had to be smarter in our use of bandwidth for news and more economical,\" he says. Even with news, however, there are opportunities for making money. The service has just launched its first polls allowing viewers to vote, again on premium rate lines. </p> <p>\"Open being in the family has really been the catalyst for our approach to interactivity,\" he says. \"It's allowed us to beef up our resource and we are really going to start rolling out this year.\" </p> <p>Last week, it launched its first pay-per-play game, Tetris. Viewers pay 25p a go, which is added to their bill, and the game has attracted 170,000 players in the first two days alone. There are plans to launch an SMS service allowing users to beam messages to mobile phones. </p> <p>But Rudder doesn't believe that every programme has the same potential for enhancement. Ashley Highfield, Rudder's counterpart at the BBC, has been \"talking bollocks\", he suggests. </p> <p>\"It is about finding the right platforms for interactivity. Ashley makes these grand gestures that no programme should now be commissioned without an interactive element. But some programmes don't have a strong interactive strand. They are pure entertainment.

At the bookies, on the racecourse (foot and mouth permitting), through the TV set-top box, mobile phone or PC. We can throw away money (which is the point of gambling) to our heart's content. But just because we can bet any time, any place, anywhere, does that mean we all will? </p> <p>At first glance, the going looks good for the UK runners. BSkyB generated \u00a333m in gambling revenues between July and December 2000.

New technology has certainly made it easier for us to place a bet than ever before. At the bookies, on the racecourse (foot and mouth permitting), through the TV set-top box, mobile phone or PC.

      "body": "<p>At 78, the grand old lady of TV listings is undergoing a costly make-over you could easily mistake for a late-life crisis. Recent press speculation suggests the Radio Times could soon be up for sale, and the BBC-owned weekly has already been relegated to second position in the fiercely competitive listings sector by What's On TV. But next week's relaunch, following \u00a37m new investment, is designed to convince readers and advertisers the magazine with the olde worlde title is neither fuddy-duddy nor out of touch. </p> <p>The make-over, including a re-styled front cover and masthead, is accompanied by an editorial shift - from covers restricted to publicising BBC programmes to regularly putting other broadcasters' output on the front - which will undoubtedly surprise those who still see the title as Auntie's listings lapdog. But insiders insist it is a \"natural next step\". Radio Times has already moved with the times to sharpen its editorial teeth, broaden and deepen its multichannel coverage and diversify into e-publishing. Now it is responding to the latest shifts in digital media - and pressures in the TV listings marketplace. </p> <p>Three publishing groups dominate the paid-for TV listings sector - IPC, publisher of market-leading What's On TV and TV Times; Bauer, publisher of TV Choice and TV Quick; and the BBC. Competition is intense, and overall the sector is seeing a decline in sales - by 10% over the past year, one estimate suggests (see box). </p> <p>Yet despite losing its No 1 spot to IPC, Radio Times, now in second position, still sells 1.26m copies a week and prides itself on a more upmarket readership profile than its rivals, which enables it to retain a higher cover price - at 79p almost twice that of What's On TV. Radio Times remains Britain's most profitable consumer magazine, turning over an estimated \u00a380m - more than \u00a350m from the cover price alone, with the balance from advertising. Small wonder then if, as last week's reports suggested, Greg Dyke is lining up Radio Times to be part of a planned \u00a31bn flotation. </p> <p>\"If the BBC needs money an obvious place to go for it would be Radio Times,\" its acting editor Nicholas Brett admits. \"When ITV sold TV Times in 1998 it went for around \u00a3250m. Given our turnover, we would certainly be worth a lot.\" Even so, he quickly adds: \"I'm unaware of any current plans. In fact in the 12 years I've been at Radio Times I can't remember a time when the story has not been doing the rounds.\" </p> <p>One thing, however, is for sure. With two years to go until her 80th birthday, the old lady is working hard to prove she's not ready for retirement yet. To prove the point, out goes the familiar curly Radio Times logo and in comes a decidedly more contemporary look courtesy of a cover design using the Gill typeface, which now becomes the standard font throughout. </p> <p>While the look is described by some media buyers as \"radical\", Brett insists the rationale behind it is anything but. Aesthetics aside, the choice of Gill is historically apt, he points out. Eric Gill, the originator of the Gill font back in the 1920s and a one-time Radio Times illustrator, was also responsible for producing the Prospero and Ariel sculptures that still adorn the entrance to Broadcasting House. \"Gill may look totally contemporary,\" he says, \"but it is also truly in tune with Radio Times's heritage and core values.\" </p> <p>Readers are hardly likely to appreciate such nuances, of course, but the key is that they see the redesign as signalling change, says Radio Times publisher Ashley Munday. For this is more than a cosmetic face-lift. The rethink has been shaped by analysis of channel output and demographics, he explains, which have been assessed against Radio Times's own readership profile to cut the magazine's multichannel focus down from 21 to 18 services. The magazine's core readership is younger than many assume - typically aged in their mid-40s, dynamic and discerning. More space will now be allocated to fewer channels and listings pagination will increase by an extra double-page spread per day. </p> <p>\"We may be covering fewer multichannels, but those featured will be more relevant to Radio Times readers - to reflect changes in the TV landscape,\" says Brett. \"Look at what has happened amongst our 3m readership. Currently one third are in multichannel homes, either courtesy of Sky or digital - less than the national average of 40%. But in the past 12 to 18 months our readers' rate of switch has been quicker [than average] - 23% compared with 11%.\" </p> <p>There is a growing role for Radio Times to scout a wider territory to highlight the best programming for its readers, Brett believes: \"Part of our job is to promote multichannel TV. We get a lot of readers wanting to know if now is the right time to change. Channels like Artsworld, Performance and E4 will enjoy billing unlike that provided by any other British magazine or newspaper - brilliant for the channel and a real point of distinction for us.\" </p> <p>Another point of difference will be what Brett calls \"voice\": \"Radio Times has for a long time been a magazine led by sub-editors, features editors and commissioning editors. Now we are saying our critics and writers are our voice - they must say what's best on radio or TV this week. The rest of us will take our lead from them.\" So responsibility for selecting what's best on TV and radio for the Radio Times audience - highlighted in its listings pages' Choices section - is shifting from the editors to the staff writers in a bid to strengthen the title's personality. </p> <p>It's quite a cultural change, Brett says with a knowing look - and no little understatement. Not so long ago Radio Times, which was launched by Lord Reith in 1923, was managed by BBC mandarins. Content was agreed by committee and producers had copy clearance - including which image went on the front cover. While much has changed since TV listings deregulation 10 years ago, Radio Times's emphasis on all things BBC has remained a constant. </p> <p>From now on, however, programmes deemed by Radio Times writers to be the best will become the focus for features coverage, and likely candidates for cover stories. Readers' tastes may still favour BBC fare but the BBC cover story will no longer be a foregone conclusion. </p> <p>Refining and deepening Radio Times's coverage will strengthen its reader promise of \"the best of the best\" and more clearly differentiate different Radio Times products, Munday hopes. \"Listings themselves are more a commodity these days, and comprehensive listings more appropriate for other platforms, such as our Radio Times webzine,\" he says. \"What sets magazines apart now is guidance.\" </p> <p>The growth of digital media presents opportunities, not threats, he claims: \"It increases demand for listings and raises the value of guidance.\" Radio Times already provides viewing recommendations for ONdigital's electronic programme guide and recently struck a similar deal with personal video technology manufacturer TiVo. \"Our future success will depend on more than branded listings for electronic programme guides,\" says Munday. \"It will be about developing credible navigation systems - signposts to say where is the 'best' programming for different types of viewer, and directing them between programmes.\" </p> <p>The Radio Times brand is already being wooed by digital services - latest discussions focus on how its extensive editorial resources can be used to enhance interactive programming. \"This is because the brand is seen to offer value as an adviser on quality programming and where it can be found,\" Munday claims. \"This must be the way ahead for us: helping platform operators to get the best frequency from electronic platforms, and helping viewers - our readers - to make the most of their time.\" Whether Radio Times will achieve this within BBC Worldwide's stable of consumer magazines or outside, however, remains to be seen. </p> <p><strong>TV listings - the hit list</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Sales in the TV listings magazine sector are declining, partly because \"paid-for\" mags must compete against titles sent by satellite/cable operators to subscribers and information viewers get free - around 30m free listings sections or supplements are available in the UK each week. </p> <p>\u0095 The growth of digital media is also bad news for print-based listings guides, as digital TV provides comprehensive listings in electronic form. Magazines have responded by placing more emphasis on advice than sheer amount of information, recognising what Andrew Roberts of media specialist Starcom Motive calls \"the growing importance of being a simplifier of choice\". </p> <p>\u0095 All listings titles bar Radio Times are viewed both by owners and media buyers as mass-market. RT prides itself on its upmarket readership, on giving less coverage to soaps and celebs, and on retaining a high cover price - at 79p almost twice that of What's On TV, and expected to rise next week. RT sales have fallen from more than 10m pre-deregulation to a latest ABC figure of 1,264,315. </p> <p>\u0095 Media specialists broadly back the thinking behind its relaunch, but warn that in seeking to be seen as slicker and more modern, it risks scaring off core readers. Claudine Collins, press director at Mediacom: \"While Radio Times may think it can afford a new look and increased cover price, alienating existing readers and attracting insufficient new ones to fill the potential shortfall is always a danger.\"</p>",

Three publishing groups dominate the paid-for TV listings sector - IPC, publisher of market-leading What's On TV and TV Times; Bauer, publisher of TV Choice and TV Quick; and the BBC. Competition is intense, and overall the sector is seeing a decline in sales - by 10% over the past year, one estimate suggests (see box). Yet despite losing its No 1 spot to IPC, Radio Times, now in second position, still sells 1.26m copies a week and prides itself on a more upmarket readership profile than its rivals, which enables it to retain a higher cover price - at 79p almost twice that of What's On TV. Radio Times remains Britain's most profitable consumer magazine, turning over an estimated \u00a380m - more than \u00a350m from the cover price alone, with the balance from advertising. Small wonder then if, as last week's reports suggested, Greg Dyke is lining up Radio Times to be part of a planned \u00a31bn flotation. \"If the BBC needs money an obvious place to go for it would be Radio Times,\" its acting editor Nicholas Brett admits. \"When ITV sold TV Times in 1998 it went for around \u00a3250m. Given our turnover, we would certainly be worth a lot.\" Even so, he quickly adds: \"I'm unaware of any current plans. In fact in the 12 years I've been at Radio Times I can't remember a time when the story has not been doing the rounds.\" One thing, however, is for sure. With two years to go until her 80th birthday, the old lady is working hard to prove she's not ready for retirement yet. To prove the point, out goes the familiar curly Radio Times logo and in comes a decidedly more contemporary look courtesy of a cover design using the Gill typeface, which now becomes the standard font throughout. While the look is described by some media buyers as \"radical\", Brett insists the rationale behind it is anything but. Aesthetics aside, the choice of Gill is historically apt, he points out. Eric Gill, the originator of the Gill font back in the 1920s and a one-time Radio Times illustrator, was also responsible for producing the Prospero and Ariel sculptures that still adorn the entrance to Broadcasting House. \"Gill may look totally contemporary,\" he says, \"but it is also truly in tune with Radio Times's heritage and core values.\" Readers are hardly likely to appreciate such nuances, of course, but the key is that they see the redesign as signalling change, says Radio Times publisher Ashley Munday. For this is more than a cosmetic face-lift. The rethink has been shaped by analysis of channel output and demographics, he explains, which have been assessed against Radio Times's own readership profile to cut the magazine's multichannel focus down from 21 to 18 services. The magazine's core readership is younger than many assume - typically aged in their mid-40s, dynamic and discerning. More space will now be allocated to fewer channels and listings pagination will increase by an extra double-page spread per day. \"We may be covering fewer multichannels, but those featured will be more relevant to Radio Times readers - to reflect changes in the TV landscape,\" says Brett. \"Look at what has happened amongst our 3m readership. Currently one third are in multichannel homes, either courtesy of Sky or digital - less than the national average of 40%. But in the past 12 to 18 months our readers' rate of switch has been quicker [than average] - 23% compared with 11%.\" There is a growing role for Radio Times to scout a wider territory to highlight the best programming for its readers, Brett believes: \"Part of our job is to promote multichannel TV. We get a lot of readers wanting to know if now is the right time to change. Channels like Artsworld, Performance and E4 will enjoy billing unlike that provided by any other British magazine or newspaper - brilliant for the channel and a real point of distinction for us.\" Another point of difference will be what Brett calls \"voice\": \"Radio Times has for a long time been a magazine led by sub-editors, features editors and commissioning editors. Now we are saying our critics and writers are our voice - they must say what's best on radio or TV this week. The rest of us will take our lead from them.\" So responsibility for selecting what's best on TV and radio for the Radio Times audience - highlighted in its listings pages' Choices section - is shifting from the editors to the staff writers in a bid to strengthen the title's personality. It's quite a cultural change, Brett says with a knowing look - and no little understatement. Not so long ago Radio Times, which was launched by Lord Reith in 1923, was managed by BBC mandarins. Content was agreed by committee and producers had copy clearance - including which image went on the front cover. While much has changed since TV listings deregulation 10 years ago, Radio Times's emphasis on all things BBC has remained a constant. From now on, however, programmes deemed by Radio Times writers to be the best will become the focus for features coverage, and likely candidates for cover stories. Readers' tastes may still favour BBC fare but the BBC cover story will no longer be a foregone conclusion. Refining and deepening Radio Times's coverage will strengthen its reader promise of \"the best of the best\" and more clearly differentiate different Radio Times products, Munday hopes. \"Listings themselves are more a commodity these days, and comprehensive listings more appropriate for other platforms, such as our Radio Times webzine,\" he says. \"What sets magazines apart now is guidance.\" The growth of digital media presents opportunities, not threats, he claims: \"It increases demand for listings and raises the value of guidance.\" Radio Times already provides viewing recommendations for ONdigital's electronic programme guide and recently struck a similar deal with personal video technology manufacturer TiVo. \"Our future success will depend on more than branded listings for electronic programme guides,\" says Munday. \"It will be about developing credible navigation systems - signposts to say where is the 'best' programming for different types of viewer, and directing them between programmes.\" The Radio Times brand is already being wooed by digital services - latest discussions focus on how its extensive editorial resources can be used to enhance interactive programming. \"This is because the brand is seen to offer value as an adviser on quality programming and where it can be found,\" Munday claims. \"This must be the way ahead for us: helping platform operators to get the best frequency from electronic platforms, and helping viewers - our readers - to make the most of their time.\" Whether Radio Times will achieve this within BBC Worldwide's stable of consumer magazines or outside, however, remains to be seen. TV listings - the hit list \u0095 Sales in the TV listings magazine sector are declining, partly because \"paid-for\" mags must compete against titles sent by satellite/cable operators to subscribers and information viewers get free - around 30m free listings sections or supplements are available in the UK each week. \u0095 The growth of digital media is also bad news for print-based listings guides, as digital TV provides comprehensive listings in electronic form. Magazines have responded by placing more emphasis on advice than sheer amount of information, recognising what Andrew Roberts of media specialist Starcom Motive calls \"the growing importance of being a simplifier of choice\". \u0095 All listings titles bar Radio Times are viewed both by owners and media buyers as mass-market. RT prides itself on its upmarket readership, on giving less coverage to soaps and celebs, and on retaining a high cover price - at 79p almost twice that of What's On TV, and expected to rise next week. RT sales have fallen from more than 10m pre-deregulation to a latest ABC figure of 1,264,315. \u0095 Media specialists broadly back the thinking behind its relaunch, but warn that in seeking to be seen as slicker and more modern, it risks scaring off core readers. Claudine Collins, press director at Mediacom: \"While Radio Times may think it can afford a new look and increased cover price, alienating existing readers and attracting insufficient new ones to fill the potential shortfall is always a danger.\"",

We're not telling you, we can't tell you - because of the Data Protection Act,\" he boomed, and added loftily: \"Don't you realise we're in the middle of a national crisis?\" </p> <p>Outside my office door, I could hear the sobs of my disinfected PA as she read the evening News &amp; Star. The toll of affected farmers read like her Christmas card list: \"Claire and William, Alison and Ian, Les and Margaret, Uncle Tucker...\" </p> <p>Despite Maff, we knew what was going on. Every morning my PA left her mother and brother on their farm, carefully dipped her shoes into a bowl of disinfectant and headed off to her office. In fear of spreading the virus, she had given up socialising, going to church, and shopping for anything other than essentials. Many others did the same, passing the burning funeral pyres and rotting carcasses left in the fields as they drove in and out of our offices. </p> <p>Three of the directors of my company were to lose their herds in the weeks to come. Eight members of staff were to be placed in quarantine, either unable to go out of their homes or unable to return to them. \"Spreading like the Plague\", screamed the front page of the Cumberland News, our weekly paper whose circulation area - throughout north Cumbria across to the edge of Northumberland and over the border into south-west Scotland - eerily mirrored the spread of the disease from its epicentre at Longtown mart. </p> <p>Yes, Minister. We did realise this was a national crisis. But did you? Did anybody in London? The sense of betrayal and isolation in Cumbria was almost as tangible as the rancid smell and roaring flames of livelihoods going up in smoke. The stench of stereotypes wafted up from the capital. Farmers come from Devon, don't they, with sweet, soft accents borrowed from the Archers? And anyway, Devon's down the road, isn't it? Television showed the west country, it seemed, non-stop. The papers followed suit. You could rent-a-rant from David Handley, fighting farmer of fuel crisis fame, but you couldn't hear the crying farmers of Cumbria for weeks to come. </p> <p>We were at the centre of a world exclusive that nobody told the world about. Our 27,000 circulation evening and 40,000 circulation weekly papers were the first by about a week to report that foot and mouth was not under control in Cumbria when Nick Brown was telling the country differently. We were first to report demands for the army to be brought in. First to point out that farmers were waiting as long as 10 days for vets to arrive and their animals to be subsequently slaughtered and disposed of. First to warn that the whole ecology of the Lake District national park was at risk. </p> <p>We stayed ahead of the media - and the politicians - not because we were doing anything clever. (In fact my recent policy decision to dispense with a full-time farming editor began to look distinctly shaky). The anger, heartbreak and frustration at the lack of urgency exhibited by \"Naff\", aggravated by the sense that nobody outside the county was listening, boiled over into five weekly broadsheet pages of foot-and-mouth news, features, and letters and six daily tabloid pages of the same. </p> <p>I privately appointed myself farming editor. Every day I was opening around 30 letters. Most of them along the lines of \"Blair fiddles while Cumbria burns\". We revolutionised our website with up-to-the-minute news of which farms were contaminated and how many beasts were to be slaughtered. We did our best to read the minds of Maff and Brown on when and where and on which animals the dreaded preventive cull was going to fall. We reported that the countryside was indeed closed, though not in the way London understood: we said that darts and dominoes, church tabletop and car boot sales were off; boy scouts stopped meeting; playgroups were cancelled; and farm children stayed off school. </p> <p>This was our news agenda. It was a story in which information was sensation every day. Circulations soared, most gratifyingly on our urban-based evening paper which in one week saw sales go up by an average 12 % per night. On the day we warned of the threat to the Lake District, our sales were up 16%. </p> <p>The first significant media awakening from London began with the Today programme. Radio 4 had spotted our story about the delay in burning carcasses. On Friday March 9, John Humphrys interviewed me. By the time the rest of the media followed up, I was a well-informed and informative farming editor. I took Jon Snow's Channel 4 film crew to buy disinfectant, and spoke knowledgably to Danish, French, Australian and Canadian news teams about Virus-O and Borax 30c. The reporter from the Paris-based Lib\u00e9ration seemed to know more about Cumbrian farming than some of the London journalists. In one memorable background interview with a southern media person, I felt I almost had to spell out the difference between pigs, sheep and cattle. </p> <p>Snow's live broadcast from Carlisle city centre on Monday, March 19 was typically informed, incisive and involving. It set down a marker for the rest and in retrospect seems to have been a turning point in media coverage. Snow's programme, ranging through the rotting carcasses to the economic despair in the Lake District, confirmed everything we had been saying for the past two weeks. </p> <p> The politicians followed in the wake of the media: the chief vet, Joyce Quin, Tony Blair, the army and, finally, Nick Brown. We were now nearing the end of week four. Over the border in Scotland, they seemed to have got their act together more quickly, more decisively, more democratically. Devolution, regional government... no longer will these issues seem quite so academic to Cumbrians. Our papers have now joined the effort to rebuild out of this disaster. The Cumberland News Farmers Fund is attracting thousands of pounds in donations. Some heads appear to have rolled or, at least, been pushed sideways within Maff. A full-scale inquiry would be useful when it's all over. </p> <p>As Mr Blair rushed through Carlisle, visiting Maff officials, farmers and soldiers on his way to Stockholm, another Whitehall press officer - this time from No 10 itself - phoned me. \"Mr Blair has your number and will ring you personally this evening if he has time,\" she said. </p> <p>Sadly, I am still waiting for the call.

      "body": "<p>All celebrity-based scandal in this feature is fictitious and any resemblance to any genuine celebrity-based scandal, fresh or stale, is entirely coincidental. OK, now we've got that out of the way - have you heard the one about the famous designer who, at a much more famous friend's wedding, drunkenly confessed that her best sex ever was a lesbian incident with a famous model? How about the revelation that a seemingly demure Irish pop band are, in fact, \"quite horrible\" and were re-named Sticky, Shouty, Fiddly and Ken by the road crew on their last tour? Oh, and a personal favourite: which former teatime TV actor was said to favour starting the sex act with: \"Tom's coming in now\"? </p> <p>Welcome to the world of <a href=\"http://www.popbitch.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Popbitch.com</a>. It's not hard to warm to the naughty and not-generally-so-nice weekly online slander-mail and its associated messageboard. The non-profit-making venture, which started as a 1,000-strong virtual clique swapping scurrilous music-industry rumour, now has more than 30,000 subscribers. </p> <p>Popbitch emerged quietly in December 1999 and, through word of mouth alone, is now so overrun with web traffic that it needs a new server, at a cost of \u00a32,500. Enter \"Bitchaid\", the site's official begging campaign, launched a fortnight ago. \"It's been very depressing,\" sighs Popbitch's officially anonymous creator (whose identity is not really that big a secret, but whom I promised to call Nigel). Nigel, who somehow manages to juggle his payment-free, part-time web hobby with a hectic media day job, sounds knackered. \"The weird thing about websites,\" he says, \"is that they're only cheap to run when hardly anyone uses them. It's a shame - you start something for fun; it becomes really popular and then you have to take a decision about whether to turn it into a business.\" But - he is adamant - that's something Popbitch will never become. </p> <p>The site's celebrity assault is two-pronged: there's the weekly newsletter, packed with highly improbable yet absorbing revelations - a sort of Private Eye meets the National Enquirer. Then there's the chatroom - a sort of Private Eye meets the school common-room - where guests are known only by their noms des plume. Nigel got the idea for Popbitch at the height of the \"get rich quick\" dot.com goldrush. </p> <p>\"We got bored and wanted to do something different,\" he says. \"Something that didn't look like it was trying to make money. After the whole Geri Halliwell/Chris Evans, Chris Evans/Billie, Geri/Robbie thing, people have become cynical about celebrity journalism.\" And the minute you go down the business route, he says, you play into the hands of PRs. The fact that Popbitch has always refused to do that is its strength - but might also be its downfall. </p> <p>Nigel maintains that the stories on the newsletter are picked when they're believed to be true. Well, true-ish. Or at least funny. \"One of my messages made it onto the newsletter once,\" says a music PR who wishes, in true Popbitch style, to remain anonymous. \"I made up a story about Nicole Appleton being born with a tail, invented a bogus medical term for it, and they put it on. It was one of the proudest days of my life.\" </p> <p>Even for those the site has offended, Popbitch is still held in great affection. Everyone loves a juicy urban myth and Popbitch's made-up tales have become legendary. Remember the one about Anais Gallagher being kept out of the public eye because she was, in fact, black - and Meg Mathews's love child with drum and bass big-wig, Goldie? And what about the alleged incident combining a former boyband member, a teenager popstar's breasts and several lines of cocaine? All Popbitch. They've even spawned commemorative T-shirts (reading \"Goldie's my dad\" and \"Chazbaps\" respectively), created by and sold - at a loss - via the site. </p> <p>Despite complaints that outsiders are ruining the quality of the gossip (\"I went on it today,\" says one former regular snootily, \"and all they were talking about was Jamie Oliver and the sexual prowess of one of S Club 7. You don't get the A-list stuff you used to\"), the message board retains a certain cosiness. </p> <p>Logging on is like eavesdropping on a bunch of old friends down at the pub. Prudish Belinda is whispered to be Popbitch himself in transsexual disguise, while Goatboy is the message board stud: \"Everyone fancies Goatboy,\" says a showbiz journalist and regular Popbitcher, \"he's lovely, but he's probably a horrible 16-year-old student from Wolverhampton.\" Ironically, these anonymous mates would probably rather pull their own eyelashes out than actually be seen conversing with one another in real life. </p> <p>Not everything on the messageboard has been a bundle of laughs, however. One posting on the board is said to have provoked a - fruitless - witchhunt for a mole at Radio 1. The subject? The minutes of a confidential playlist meeting which, with its alarming judgments (such as \"no longer relevant\", \"priority act with label, but station think they're rubbish\" to \"a good image - a band R1 wants to be associated with\"), embarrassingly read more like a marketing report than the sentiments of people who claim to love music. </p> <p>Another, more damaging, incident involved an innocent TV presenter and some extremely unpleasant allegations of illegal sexual preferences. It got the site closed down for three weeks. The ensuing legal action from the presenter's camp, Nigel says, still hangs over him. It is the reason for the introduction of compulsory registration for those using the chatroom. \"We felt people were posting this kind of thing just to get a reaction. I don't want the site to be dealing with issues that affect people's lives like that. It's supposed to be entertaining.\" </p> <p>But celebrities and large corporations are not the only victims. The harsh spotlight of defamation has also shone on the obscure: \"A friend called one day to say there were some messages on Popbitch about me,\" recalls one music PR. \"They suggested that I had had extra-marital affairs. At the time, I'd only been married three months. What's disconcerting is that while those who know me know it was utter rubbish, people I only know professionally, may believe it.\" Another journalist, however, was pleasantly surprised when she heard she'd been given the Popbitch treatment: \"I totally panicked, thinking I was being slagged off, but it turned out that I was on the Top 10 Journalists You Want To Shag list.\" Still, apart from the tricky TV presenter situation, Popbitch has surprisingly few enemies. One PR company, the Outside Organisation, whose clients, the Spice Girls, had some - sadly unrepeatable - stories posted about them, asked Popbitch to remove the comments. \"We actually all found the things hilarious,\" says Outside's Stuart Bell, \"but they were so far from the truth that our clients may have found them offensive.\" Even Radio 1 didn't take its fury out on Popbitch. \"It was more how the information got out that worried us,\" says a BBC source, \"but I don't think any of us want to see Popbitch die.\" </p> <p>Many former fans still feel the quality of the website's slander is waning, though. \"It's lost its initial underground charm and appeal,\" says the manager of a high-profile indie act, echoing almost everyone quoted in this piece. It's perhaps just another urban myth, but Madonna is rumoured to have logged on briefly, using MLVC (her initials) as her guise.

      "bodyText": "All celebrity-based scandal in this feature is fictitious and any resemblance to any genuine celebrity-based scandal, fresh or stale, is entirely coincidental. OK, now we've got that out of the way - have you heard the one about the famous designer who, at a much more famous friend's wedding, drunkenly confessed that her best sex ever was a lesbian incident with a famous model? How about the revelation that a seemingly demure Irish pop band are, in fact, \"quite horrible\" and were re-named Sticky, Shouty, Fiddly and Ken by the road crew on their last tour? Oh, and a personal favourite: which former teatime TV actor was said to favour starting the sex act with: \"Tom's coming in now\"? Welcome to the world of Popbitch.com. It's not hard to warm to the naughty and not-generally-so-nice weekly online slander-mail and its associated messageboard. The non-profit-making venture, which started as a 1,000-strong virtual clique swapping scurrilous music-industry rumour, now has more than 30,000 subscribers. Popbitch emerged quietly in December 1999 and, through word of mouth alone, is now so overrun with web traffic that it needs a new server, at a cost of \u00a32,500. Enter \"Bitchaid\", the site's official begging campaign, launched a fortnight ago. \"It's been very depressing,\" sighs Popbitch's officially anonymous creator (whose identity is not really that big a secret, but whom I promised to call Nigel). Nigel, who somehow manages to juggle his payment-free, part-time web hobby with a hectic media day job, sounds knackered. \"The weird thing about websites,\" he says, \"is that they're only cheap to run when hardly anyone uses them. It's a shame - you start something for fun; it becomes really popular and then you have to take a decision about whether to turn it into a business.\" But - he is adamant - that's something Popbitch will never become. The site's celebrity assault is two-pronged: there's the weekly newsletter, packed with highly improbable yet absorbing revelations - a sort of Private Eye meets the National Enquirer. Then there's the chatroom - a sort of Private Eye meets the school common-room - where guests are known only by their noms des plume. Nigel got the idea for Popbitch at the height of the \"get rich quick\" dot.com goldrush. \"We got bored and wanted to do something different,\" he says. \"Something that didn't look like it was trying to make money. After the whole Geri Halliwell/Chris Evans, Chris Evans/Billie, Geri/Robbie thing, people have become cynical about celebrity journalism.\" And the minute you go down the business route, he says, you play into the hands of PRs. The fact that Popbitch has always refused to do that is its strength - but might also be its downfall. Nigel maintains that the stories on the newsletter are picked when they're believed to be true. Well, true-ish. Or at least funny. \"One of my messages made it onto the newsletter once,\" says a music PR who wishes, in true Popbitch style, to remain anonymous. \"I made up a story about Nicole Appleton being born with a tail, invented a bogus medical term for it, and they put it on. It was one of the proudest days of my life.\" Even for those the site has offended, Popbitch is still held in great affection. Everyone loves a juicy urban myth and Popbitch's made-up tales have become legendary. Remember the one about Anais Gallagher being kept out of the public eye because she was, in fact, black - and Meg Mathews's love child with drum and bass big-wig, Goldie? And what about the alleged incident combining a former boyband member, a teenager popstar's breasts and several lines of cocaine? All Popbitch. They've even spawned commemorative T-shirts (reading \"Goldie's my dad\" and \"Chazbaps\" respectively), created by and sold - at a loss - via the site. Despite complaints that outsiders are ruining the quality of the gossip (\"I went on it today,\" says one former regular snootily, \"and all they were talking about was Jamie Oliver and the sexual prowess of one of S Club 7. You don't get the A-list stuff you used to\"), the message board retains a certain cosiness. Logging on is like eavesdropping on a bunch of old friends down at the pub. Prudish Belinda is whispered to be Popbitch himself in transsexual disguise, while Goatboy is the message board stud: \"Everyone fancies Goatboy,\" says a showbiz journalist and regular Popbitcher, \"he's lovely, but he's probably a horrible 16-year-old student from Wolverhampton.\" Ironically, these anonymous mates would probably rather pull their own eyelashes out than actually be seen conversing with one another in real life. Not everything on the messageboard has been a bundle of laughs, however. One posting on the board is said to have provoked a - fruitless - witchhunt for a mole at Radio 1. The subject? The minutes of a confidential playlist meeting which, with its alarming judgments (such as \"no longer relevant\", \"priority act with label, but station think they're rubbish\" to \"a good image - a band R1 wants to be associated with\"), embarrassingly read more like a marketing report than the sentiments of people who claim to love music. Another, more damaging, incident involved an innocent TV presenter and some extremely unpleasant allegations of illegal sexual preferences. It got the site closed down for three weeks. The ensuing legal action from the presenter's camp, Nigel says, still hangs over him. It is the reason for the introduction of compulsory registration for those using the chatroom. \"We felt people were posting this kind of thing just to get a reaction. I don't want the site to be dealing with issues that affect people's lives like that. It's supposed to be entertaining.\" But celebrities and large corporations are not the only victims. The harsh spotlight of defamation has also shone on the obscure: \"A friend called one day to say there were some messages on Popbitch about me,\" recalls one music PR. \"They suggested that I had had extra-marital affairs. At the time, I'd only been married three months. What's disconcerting is that while those who know me know it was utter rubbish, people I only know professionally, may believe it.\" Another journalist, however, was pleasantly surprised when she heard she'd been given the Popbitch treatment: \"I totally panicked, thinking I was being slagged off, but it turned out that I was on the Top 10 Journalists You Want To Shag list.\" Still, apart from the tricky TV presenter situation, Popbitch has surprisingly few enemies. One PR company, the Outside Organisation, whose clients, the Spice Girls, had some - sadly unrepeatable - stories posted about them, asked Popbitch to remove the comments. \"We actually all found the things hilarious,\" says Outside's Stuart Bell, \"but they were so far from the truth that our clients may have found them offensive.\" Even Radio 1 didn't take its fury out on Popbitch. \"It was more how the information got out that worried us,\" says a BBC source, \"but I don't think any of us want to see Popbitch die.\" Many former fans still feel the quality of the website's slander is waning, though. \"It's lost its initial underground charm and appeal,\" says the manager of a high-profile indie act, echoing almost everyone quoted in this piece. It's perhaps just another urban myth, but Madonna is rumoured to have logged on briefly, using MLVC (her initials) as her guise. Perhaps coincidentally, on stage the following day she dedicated a song to all the popbitches out there. \"That was when the site peaked,\" the manager says. \"At that moment, a lot of non-industry people became part of Popbitch and that's made it far more trivial.\" A music writer agrees: \"A friend actually met up with someone from the board, and he turned out not to be in the industry,\" she shrieks. \"He was a city trader!\" Despite all that, the site has enough loyal aficionados to have raised more than half the required rescue money in the first week of its appeal.

The appeal's fast-track success has nipped in the bud the dubious idea of a fundraising party. \"A lot of people were looking forward to it,\" says the showbiz journalist. \"They want to meet each other. But it would have been a nightmare - you imagine it's all going to be glamorous media people but you know if you turned up it'd just be a bunch of spotty students.\" And that's the spirit that might just keep Popbitch's unique underground charm alive. \"Everyone knows who's behind Popbitch,\" she continues, \"but none of us will ever mention his name because we don't want it ever to stop.\"",

      "body": "<p>More than a few delicately pencilled eyebrows were raised this week after news of Liz Jones's departure from the editor's chair at Marie Claire started to leak out from IPC. The company is still sticking to the party line about Jones's departure, saying that she has left to pursue other interests and write a book. But her departure, shortly after ABC figures showed the magazine had lost 11% of its sales, prompted widespread speculation that the company was unhappy with her performance. </p> <p>Once described as \"the politically correct Cosmopolitan\", Marie Claire's star has waned over the past year, its sales slumping from a high of 450,000 for the end of 1999 to just above 400,000. After a high-profile launch in 1988 under editor Glenda Bailey, it established itself as the only magazine capable of successfully combining gloss with grit, famously covering issues such as female circumcision. By the mid-1990s it was catching Cosmo. </p> <p>Despite the fact that there's now clear blue water between the two titles, observers don't believe the gap is big enough to warrant the treatment of Jones. Marcelle d'Argy Smith, a former Cosmopolitan editor, is shocked. \"It's ruthless,\" she says. \"A good company would have gone, 'Hang on, what does this editor need?' I may not have liked everything that Liz Jones wrote, but she was very bright and got them lots of publicity. It's a bit like a holiday company having a single complaint and then firing the manager.\" </p> <p>Ian Birch, editor-in-chief of Emap Elan women's titles, believes there's more pressure on women's magazine editors than ever before. \"In a celebrity dominated world, an editor experiences a small glimmer of what it's like to be a true celebrity,\" he says. \"In the same way American Vogue is Anna Wintour and Anna Wintour is American Vogue, the editors have to be spokespeople for their magazines.\" For d'Argy Smith, Jones's departure is symptomatic of editors' increasing impotence in relation to publishers and advertisers. \"The editors are now simply weathergirls,\" she says. </p> <p>Jones, who joined the magazine in 1999 from the Sunday Times Style section, got Marie Claire noticed. Her tenure will be remembered chiefly (although probably unfairly) for her Sunday Times Single File column, which chronicled the neuroses of the pampered western female in lurid technicolour. The columns became an apocalyptic, media-will-eat-itself vision of what happens to the single professional woman when you read too many women's magazines. </p> <p>Jones's descriptions of her military-style preparation for a date prompted disgust and sympathy in equal measure. \"I go into training,\" she wrote. \"I run and work out every single day. I buy new clothes. I get the cleaner in to do a special spring-clean of my house and wax the floorboards. The gardener will come. I get the window-cleaner to do the windows.\" </p> <p>The columns were all the more compelling because of Jones's apparent failure to make any connection between her cosmetic self-flagellation and her romantic problems. However much we were repelled by the neurosis (not to mention the spare cash), we responded to the candour. Jones's interest in body dysmorphia culminated in the decision to put large-size model Sophie Dahl on the cover of the magazine alongside the slimline Pamela Anderson. </p> <p>Insiders say Groupe Marie Claire, the owner of the Marie Claire international brand, did not share Jones's editorial vision, and there are unconfirmed reports that her resignation was precipitated by an argument over the use of Victoria Beckham as a cover model. Both IPC and Groupe Marie Claire began to feel that Jones was beginning to bring too much of her personality into the magazine and that it was becoming \"worthy\". </p> <p>Marie Claire's award-winning Reportage section has always been controversial. For everyone who thinks the reports from far-flung corners of the globe are a valuable window onto a misrepresented world, there are others who see them as a figleaf for the lack of serious reporting in women's magazines. Others believe \"worthy\" content has no place in a glossy. </p> <p>Recent rumours that the section was to be axed have been staunchly denied by IPC, but insiders now say that under new editor Marie O'Riordan, \"pendulous breasts in the Kalahari\" articles may go the way of all flesh. O'Riordan has indicated that she wants the magazine to be more \"fun\". </p> <p>Jones is the second women's magazine editor to quit in six months amid reports that her work was too serious. In October, Sally Brampton, the former Elle editor, quit Red. Like Jones, Brampton was an editor who believed women's magazines should try to broaden their focus beyond the staples of celebrity, sex and fashion, and when her resignation is discussed among publishing executives the dreaded \"worthy\" tag has stuck. </p> <p>The ghost of Wagadon's Frank - the high-profile \"intelligent\" glossy canned indecently quickly - now hangs like an albatross over any mag azine covering anything more intellectually challenging than a new lipstick. D'Argy Smith believes that broader social affairs coverage has been deliberately marginalised. </p> <p>\"When I was editing Cosmo we had Lesley Abdela as a political editor,\" she says. \"This would be unthinkable today.\" She blames her successor, Mandi Norwood, for a fundamental shift in the concept of \"accessibility\" in the woman's magazine. \"Mandi Norwood introduced the concept of the Essex girl into the women's magazine market. She captured a kind of zeitgeist, which is dumbing down,\" she says. Gill Hudson, editor of the BBC's rival intelligent glossy Eve, will not be drawn into a discussion on Jones's editing style, but thinks that, if anything, Marie Claire had gone too tabloid for her liking. </p> <p>Pendulous breasts in the Kalahari are struggling against skeletal stars in designer frocks as women's magazine publishers dive into the celebrity market. And so far, the punters seem to like it. The success of Emap's Heat, whose circulation bulged by 140% in the last ABCs, is testimony to this. Perhaps more significant for the established glossies such as Marie Claire and Cosmo are the recent launches of Time Inc's In Style and Cond\u00e9 Nast's Glamour, which is reported to have sold 500,000 copies in its first month. </p> <p>In Style's editor Dee Nolan believes that far from being an escapist fantasy, the cult of celebrity is a \"reality check\" after magazines' previous fixation with supermodels. \"Models are so far removed from our lives,\" she says, \"while celebrities, although they are at the gorgeous end of real, are nevertheless real people to whom we can aspire.\" Nolan believes that the interest in celebrity also reflects the growing influence of female producers and stars in the Hollywood system and the media in general. </p> <p>The new magazines have given the established glossies a shock to the system, according to Mindshare's press buying director Paul Thomas. \"There's more competition in the marketplace than ever before. Glamour and In Style have launched very strongly and there's a danger that some of the really traditional brands could be damaged.\" In this kind of climate, the 11% drop in circulation of the kind experienced by Marie Claire in the last ABCs is bound to have given IPC pause, and the pressure is on the publishers to deliver numbers. </p> <p> Ian Birch of Emap Elan thinks that \"to divide the market into celebrity versus grittiness is an oversimplification\". He claims that the proliferation of media means that it's no longer appropriate for a woman's magazine to aspire to a one-size-fits-all read. \"If the Elle reader wants to know about politics, she will log on to CNN.com or watch Channel 4 News or Sky. If she wants to read about style, she will pick up a magazine like Elle.\" </p> <p>D'Argy Smith puts it more succinctly. \"We all know that 10 years ago newspapers discovered women. Magazines always used to be able to do what newspapers can't. Now there's not a lot newspapers can't do and you have to ask yourself what magazines can.\" </p> <p>Lorraine Candy, editor of Cosmpolitan, makes the point that in periods of tough competition or even recession, women are less likely to buy more than one magazine. Glossies will win or lose the battle for readers on eye-grabbing coverlines, she says. And in an aggressive battle for jaded consumers, magazine publishers will be falling over themselves to lose the worthy tag. </p> <p>Meanwhile, globalisation means that magazines have to answer more and more to global masters. \"Increasingly, magazine brands are part of an international strategy,\" says Birch. \"It's understood that the local editor has a local knowledge and understanding. But if editors misinterpret that brand, then clearly that needs to be looked at.\" </p> <p>For d'Argy Smith, there is little room for editors to manoeuvre within these international templates. \"None of the magazines have the balls to deviate from the formula. When, occasionally, you do get one, all the publishers lose their cool. It's like all the girls wanting to have exactly the same hairstyle.\" </p> <p><strong>Focus on real people</strong></p> <p>\"I was going to quote the Dalai Lama, but all my friends will take the piss,\" quips Janice Turner when asked whether she's nervous about launch editing Real, the new women's fortnightly from H Bauer. \"Great achievement and great love always require great risk,\" she says. \"What's the alternative? Not jumping?\" </p> <p>H Bauer is really jumping with Real, which launches this week with a hugely ambitious print run of 900,000, and has a \u00a310m marketing budget. \"We're confident that we've got a good product and we can make it work,\" says Turner, unblinking. </p> <p>It's a bit of a hairy time to be launching a magazine, particularly a women's magazine - as Liz Jones's resignation underlined. Women's titles in general made a fairly undistinguished showing in the recent ABC figures. </p> <p>At first glance there's a bit of a \"so what\" factor about any new women's magazine. At least seven glossies have launched in the past two years. Cosmopolitan editor, Lorraine Candy is bemused. \"In a declining, fragmenting market it seems odd that publishers are still clinging to the holy grail that all that's needed is a brand-new woman's magazine.\" </p> <p>Real must avoid the curse of Riva, a mid-market women's fortnightly \"intel ligent glossy\" launched in the early 1990s by Sally O'Sullivan, which bombed, taking an estimated \u00a37m of IPC's money with it. </p> <p>Real's pitch is to bring glossy production values and intelligence into an accessible women's weekly format. \"We have the pace and vitality and relevance of a weekly but the glossiness, design and intelligence of a monthly,\" says Turner. It's a more upmarket and older demographic than the staple women's weeklies, promising articles by, among others, Julie Burchill and Channel 4 News's Kirsty Lang. </p> <p>Turner turns up her nose at suggestions that it's a Woman's Weekly for Guardian readers. \"We're not worthy,\" she says. God forbid. The first issue is promisingly seductive, with echoes of You magazine in the sumptuous design. </p> <p>Real also rejects the current love affair with celebrity. \"I have always passionately believed that real people are more interesting than celebrities. I know it's against the climate to say this, but I think there's a saturation factor with '16 clutch bags Julia Roberts wants to wear to the Oscars'.\" Instead there's a feature on real life gigolos, an interview with the \"real life\" DCI Tennison, and an emphasis on practical advice, in features like \"how to have sex with the same man for the rest of your life\". </p> <p>A lot of onlookers are hoping Real does work. Eve magazine's editor Gill Hudson says it's an opportunity to revitalise the \"fantastically homogeneous\" women's market. \"If the fortnightly format does work, it could potentially open up a whole new market,\" she says. </p> <p>Maire Fahey, editor of Prima, agrees. \"If you can break people's reading habits, you can really change the market. The evidence from the celebrity magazines is that people are crying out for new formats.\" </p> <p>The history of H Bauer, which launched several successful new titles into a recession at the end of the 80s, suggests that if anyone can pull it off, they can. Fahey notes that \"they don't take prisoners\". And Turner, at least, is in it for the long haul.</p>",

He claims that the proliferation of media means that it's no longer appropriate for a woman's magazine to aspire to a one-size-fits-all read. \"If the Elle reader wants to know about politics, she will log on to CNN.com or watch Channel 4 News or Sky. If she wants to read about style, she will pick up a magazine like Elle.\" D'Argy Smith puts it more succinctly. \"We all know that 10 years ago newspapers discovered women. Magazines always used to be able to do what newspapers can't. Now there's not a lot newspapers can't do and you have to ask yourself what magazines can.\" Lorraine Candy, editor of Cosmpolitan, makes the point that in periods of tough competition or even recession, women are less likely to buy more than one magazine. Glossies will win or lose the battle for readers on eye-grabbing coverlines, she says. And in an aggressive battle for jaded consumers, magazine publishers will be falling over themselves to lose the worthy tag. Meanwhile, globalisation means that magazines have to answer more and more to global masters. \"Increasingly, magazine brands are part of an international strategy,\" says Birch. \"It's understood that the local editor has a local knowledge and understanding. But if editors misinterpret that brand, then clearly that needs to be looked at.\" For d'Argy Smith, there is little room for editors to manoeuvre within these international templates. \"None of the magazines have the balls to deviate from the formula. When, occasionally, you do get one, all the publishers lose their cool. It's like all the girls wanting to have exactly the same hairstyle.\" Focus on real people \"I was going to quote the Dalai Lama, but all my friends will take the piss,\" quips Janice Turner when asked whether she's nervous about launch editing Real, the new women's fortnightly from H Bauer. \"Great achievement and great love always require great risk,\" she says. \"What's the alternative? Not jumping?\" H Bauer is really jumping with Real, which launches this week with a hugely ambitious print run of 900,000, and has a \u00a310m marketing budget. \"We're confident that we've got a good product and we can make it work,\" says Turner, unblinking. It's a bit of a hairy time to be launching a magazine, particularly a women's magazine - as Liz Jones's resignation underlined. Women's titles in general made a fairly undistinguished showing in the recent ABC figures. At first glance there's a bit of a \"so what\" factor about any new women's magazine. At least seven glossies have launched in the past two years. Cosmopolitan editor, Lorraine Candy is bemused. \"In a declining, fragmenting market it seems odd that publishers are still clinging to the holy grail that all that's needed is a brand-new woman's magazine.\" Real must avoid the curse of Riva, a mid-market women's fortnightly \"intel ligent glossy\" launched in the early 1990s by Sally O'Sullivan, which bombed, taking an estimated \u00a37m of IPC's money with it. Real's pitch is to bring glossy production values and intelligence into an accessible women's weekly format. \"We have the pace and vitality and relevance of a weekly but the glossiness, design and intelligence of a monthly,\" says Turner. It's a more upmarket and older demographic than the staple women's weeklies, promising articles by, among others, Julie Burchill and Channel 4 News's Kirsty Lang. Turner turns up her nose at suggestions that it's a Woman's Weekly for Guardian readers. \"We're not worthy,\" she says. God forbid. The first issue is promisingly seductive, with echoes of You magazine in the sumptuous design. Real also rejects the current love affair with celebrity. \"I have always passionately believed that real people are more interesting than celebrities. I know it's against the climate to say this, but I think there's a saturation factor with '16 clutch bags Julia Roberts wants to wear to the Oscars'.\" Instead there's a feature on real life gigolos, an interview with the \"real life\" DCI Tennison, and an emphasis on practical advice, in features like \"how to have sex with the same man for the rest of your life\". A lot of onlookers are hoping Real does work. Eve magazine's editor Gill Hudson says it's an opportunity to revitalise the \"fantastically homogeneous\" women's market. \"If the fortnightly format does work, it could potentially open up a whole new market,\" she says. Maire Fahey, editor of Prima, agrees. \"If you can break people's reading habits, you can really change the market. The evidence from the celebrity magazines is that people are crying out for new formats.\" The history of H Bauer, which launched several successful new titles into a recession at the end of the 80s, suggests that if anyone can pull it off, they can. Fahey notes that \"they don't take prisoners\". And Turner, at least, is in it for the long haul.",

      "bodyText": "The new children and family court welfare service in England and Wales begins its first working day today amid growing controversy. Even before the launch of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass), the complexities of creating a unified body to work in the best interests of the child were already becoming apparent. The challenge of combining family court welfare functions that were formerly provided by the probation service, the children's branch of the official solicitor's department, and guardian ad litem and reporting officer services into one integrated system means the embryonic service has been experiencing some uncomfortable birth pangs. Guardians ad litem, who represent vulnerable children in public law cases, are concerned about the way they will be paid in future. Before Cafcass came into being the guardians were mostly self employed, worked for councils and were paid an hourly rate. Under new arrangements there are plans to pay them under banding systems of fixed fees. Representatives of the National Association of Guardians ad Litem and Reporting Officers (Nagalro) are arguing that the new arrangements for fixed fees may fundamentally change the way they work and, as a consequence, undermine the vital work they do in representing and safeguarding children. As a result, the association is challenging the proposed pay structure and threatening a judicial review if no acceptable way forward can be found. A six-week moratorium has been agreed to find a solution, and Nagalro has taken legal advice, although it is said to be cautiously optimistic that a more reasonable agreement can be negotiated with Cafcass. Susan Bindman, chairwoman of Nagalro said: \"The work that we do is highly complex and demands flexibility.

A short-term measure means that guardians ad litem will continue to be paid under existing arrangements. The Association of Family Court Welfare Officers (AFCWO) is among those that have broadly welcomed the new service. Chairman Jim Lawson said: \"There are a number of potential benefits from an integrated advisory and support service for family courts, not least the fact that there can now be agreed national standards with practitioners. \"In the past, family court welfare was formerly part of the probation service and had become extremely marginalised within the service. Guardian panels were administered by the local authority and that meant the authorities were effectively paying for the guardians.\" Most guardians ad litem are involved in disputes between local authorities and parents, but because of this financial link with council there were fears they would be seen as less independent than they really were. Mr Lawson sees the challenge for Cafcass as providing a new organisation that will encourage the exchange of skills and contribute to the professional development of all the participants. \"But there may be problems with vested interests if professionals attempt to cling to the past rather than embracing the future,\" he warned. Mr Hewson says delays in the family court system were leading to some children having to wait up to 40 weeks to get into the system: \"In future we will be able to analyse the areas where children are facing unacceptable waiting times and effectively address the problems with a unified approach.\" He believes the main task is to listen to the views of children to create a truly child-focused system: \"Over the next 12-months we are going to be asking children what it is that they would like to see in terms of a service.

Let him once learn to take a straight shaving off a plank, or draw a fine curve without faltering, or lay a brick level in its mortar, and he has learned a multitude of other matters which no lips of man could ever teach him.\" </p> <p>Ruskin is quoted by the architect Hugh Pople in the catalogue for Making Buildings, a touring exhibition about the craft of architecture. Pople believes that craft skills in modern British building and architecture have all too often been lacking, because \"the UK not only under-invested in its built environment during the 20th century, but also under-invested in its most valuable asset: its people\". </p> <p>Given that British industry has treated labour, even highly skilled labour, like cannon-fodder, it is easy to see why today's building industry and architects have had difficulty finding craftsmanship of a high standard. Housebuilders are turning to new concrete techniques even in the construction of traditional-looking new homes; facades are increasingly pasted on like wallpaper. </p> <p>This, though, is not the whole story. There are many highly skilled craftspeople working at the arts- inspired end of the building industry, and there has also been a new wave of craft workers emerging over the past 25 years alongside Britain's hi-tech architects. </p> <p>Making Buildings has been organised by the Crafts Council with the New Art Gallery, Walsall, and the Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College, where curator Greg Votolato is professor of design. Votolato's show concentrates on the overtly environmentally friendly end of modern craft-inspired construction, taking in abstract artworks whose theme is architecture. Yet some of the latest talent is in the craftsmanship required by architects of the hi-tech school of Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. </p> <p>The fact is that many new buildings are crafted - but in ways that we have learned only slowly to appreciate. Foster's Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank in Hong Kong, for example, is a superb example of custom-made architecture, a building crafted using the skills of welders, glaziers and steel-makers. It has about it the mix of computer-age technology and handmaking that is the glue of the aerospace industry. Architects are recovering at least a part of their role in the craft and building process. But what about the workers? On display in Making Buildings are examples of the work of architectural practices such as Edward Cullinan's, which, although utterly modern in concept, require a high degree of craft skill. Cullinan's upcoming New Conservation Centre for the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum at Singleton, Sussex, is an inspiring example. The Crafts Council show displays a section of the building; a thing of almost boundless curves, it is built of layers of green oak. It is clad in cedar, has spruce floors and has the air of an ultra-modern parish church. It is a fine mix of modern boat-building and even aircraft technology, crafted by hands, aided by computer design. </p> <p>There are also examples of the work of the Walter Segal Self Build Trust, which enables communities to construct their own practical and modern homes. This is like a translation to Britain, via the Bauhaus aesthetic of the late Walter Segal, of Shaker or Amish communal building methods. Here, the process of building is as important as the finished product - as it is in the case of Amish barns. No one who saw the film Witness can forget the scene in which an Amish village raises a clapboard barn in what seems like one dreamy day. </p> <p>Elsewhere there are more lighthearted, unorthodox and experimental uses of new craft skills and materials. Ushida Findlay Architects, from Tokyo, have collaborated with the basket-maker Lee Dalby on the design of a curious vortex of bamboo - it makes a lovely sound - intended, in part, to connect new architectural ideas with sensual and responsive building materials. A similar theme is pursued by the Japanese architect Tono Mirai, who shows lovely \"nests\" of mud and straw - dreamy structures hovering happily between the worlds of practical building and architectural dreaming. </p> <p>Building and dreaming have been fused together several times by Jim Partridge, a craftsman who works mainly with unseasoned green timber; the shelter and information centre he made with Liz Walmsley from thuya and larch logs for the Chilterns Sculpture Trail is one of the most delightful buildings I've seen in recent years. Sadly, it has been taken down because children like to play on it. It would be good to see other structures like this, and even to allow children to play on them. </p> <p>This may seem an unfocused show, but it's not: it sets out to show the diverse range of craft skills required for and emerging from new forms of architecture and new materials. It's dangerous to be over- optimistic, given the fact that most of the trashy buildings we spend our working and domestic lives in are about as finely crafted as an MDF bookcase from a budget DIY warehouse. Yet the desire to build beautifully is unlikely to go away as long as there is someone around who appreciates taking a straight shaving off a plank, drawing a fine curve without faltering or laying a brick level in its mortar. And, as the great architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe liked to say, architecture began \"when two bricks were put together well\".</p>",

      "body": "<p>The sponsorship details that were sent out by BAAF several months ago stated that this trip would be \"a challenge of a lifetime\". Today I think everyone's expectations were surpassed!</p> <p>We left the hotel early this morning, some still suffering from the previous night's entertainment (myself included). We arrived at Jinshangling, one of the lesser visited parts of the wall. It looked impressive from the bottom, after climbing some steep steps, we were on our first watchtower. The view was magnificent.</p> <p>Fortunately, the sun was up, although it was fairly cold until we started walking. For about two hours, we weaved our way along the wall with our local guides. The walk was amazing and covered some difficult conditions - crumbling walls and more steep steps up and down. Some parts were 90 degree angles and we had to practically crawl up - not for the faint hearted. </p> <p>There are 20 people participating, ranging in age from 23 to 64, and of several different professions. Some people are directly involved in adoption and fostering in both England and China. The rest of us just wanted to raise awareness and money for this issue. I am a student at City University, in London, studying psychology. I worked for nine years in an American bank but two years ago decided on a career change. My aim is to become a child psychologist and become more involved in adoption and fostering issues.</p> <p>Today, I have had some great conversations with people about their experiences. Robert Glover and I discussed the Chinese perspective on adoption and fostering. He works for Care for Children in Shanghai. A personal sponsorship of \u00a3100 per year keeps a child in a foster family in Kunming (I've already signed up).</p> <p>Lunch was on a watchtower. Those fried egg and spam sandwiches are not going down well. The rest of the walk en route to Simatai was as challenging as the morning's. At our final destination we had passed 32 watchtowers and more than 12kms. We brought some souvenirs from our guides as a gesture of our gratitude.</p> <p>The journey back to the hotel was buzzing with adrenaline. Everyone was exhilarated and proud of our achievements. Everyone on this trip is here to raise money for child welfare in England and China, which we couldn't have done without the companies, the family members and friends who have given so generously.</p> <p>It was a truly amazing day. The landscape was spectacular, the walk challenging and the company great.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The sponsorship details that were sent out by BAAF several months ago stated that this trip would be \"a challenge of a lifetime\". Today I think everyone's expectations were surpassed! We left the hotel early this morning, some still suffering from the previous night's entertainment (myself included). We arrived at Jinshangling, one of the lesser visited parts of the wall. It looked impressive from the bottom, after climbing some steep steps, we were on our first watchtower. The view was magnificent. Fortunately, the sun was up, although it was fairly cold until we started walking. For about two hours, we weaved our way along the wall with our local guides. The walk was amazing and covered some difficult conditions - crumbling walls and more steep steps up and down. Some parts were 90 degree angles and we had to practically crawl up - not for the faint hearted. There are 20 people participating, ranging in age from 23 to 64, and of several different professions. Some people are directly involved in adoption and fostering in both England and China. The rest of us just wanted to raise awareness and money for this issue. I am a student at City University, in London, studying psychology. I worked for nine years in an American bank but two years ago decided on a career change. My aim is to become a child psychologist and become more involved in adoption and fostering issues. Today, I have had some great conversations with people about their experiences. Robert Glover and I discussed the Chinese perspective on adoption and fostering. He works for Care for Children in Shanghai. A personal sponsorship of \u00a3100 per year keeps a child in a foster family in Kunming (I've already signed up). Lunch was on a watchtower. Those fried egg and spam sandwiches are not going down well. The rest of the walk en route to Simatai was as challenging as the morning's. At our final destination we had passed 32 watchtowers and more than 12kms. We brought some souvenirs from our guides as a gesture of our gratitude. The journey back to the hotel was buzzing with adrenaline. Everyone was exhilarated and proud of our achievements. Everyone on this trip is here to raise money for child welfare in England and China, which we couldn't have done without the companies, the family members and friends who have given so generously. It was a truly amazing day. The landscape was spectacular, the walk challenging and the company great.",

      "bodyText": "In both stories a girl has a traumatic coming of age in northern Italy, rebels, escapes on a bicycle, runs into a man with a drooping moustache, and has a baby. What happens next is up to the courts, for the similarities between the stories have lobbed a grenade into Italy's usually placid publishing world. Ippolita Avalli, an acclaimed novelist, is suing her bestselling former friend Susanna Tamaro for plagiarism. Accusations of betrayal and deceit, themes common to their fiction, are being flung in an increasingly dirty fight. Ms Avalli is seeking \u00a31.7m damages and wants Ms Tamaro's book, Answer Me, removed from bookshops. Ms Tamaro has responded with a \u00a31m counter-claim. Ms Avalli's autobiographical 1997 novel The Goddess of Kisses was hailed for its bleak depiction of growing up. Narrated in the first-person in curt prose, it was shortlisted for the Strega prize. She claims that its plot, structure and vocabulary were ripped off in the title story of Answer Me, a short-story collection which has sold 200,000 copies since its publication earlier this year, making Ms Tamaro one of Italy's most successful authors. \"It was clearly and blatantly plagiarised,\" Ms Avelli's lawyer Nicola Rocchett, told Panorama magazine. His court case lists 35 points of similarity. \"The plot, characters, style, atmosphere, natural and socio-cultural setting, as well as the premises and conclusions, are nearly identical,\" he said In The Goddess of Kisses, published by Baldini &amp; Castoldi, the narrator Giovanna throws a tantrum during mass, condemns the Catholic church and calls the congregation \"whitewashed tombs\". In Answer Me, published by Rizzoli, the narrator Rosa smashes a statue of Jesus during mass and calls the congregation \"whitewashed tombs\". Rosa, like Giovanna, flees her house on a bicycle and crashes into a man whose moustache is \"drooping\". Ms Avalli said there was no doubt about her former friend's guilt. \"She and her editor are people who know me very well. There's no way they couldn't have realised it.\" She was especially affronted that her character's pregnancy - drawn from her own experience - was replicated, an alleged theft of her private life as well as fiction.

      "bodyText": "Macedonia is to begin a broad political dialogue with the leaders of its Albanian community in response to the European Union's attempt to defuse the country's crisis, it emerged at the weekend. The EU's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, who is holding talks in Skopje today, is expecting to see a \"Europe committee\" or \"round table\" designed to resolve the country's bitter inter-ethnic differences and pave the way for a EU-Macedonian agreement next week. Mr Solana and the EU's commissioner for external relations, Chris Patten, are due to meet President Boris Trajkovski, opposition leaders and leaders of the Albanian parties. President Trajkovski is said to be ready to join an all-party dialogue and to revise parts of the constitution to take into account Albanian sensitivities, after the weeks of fighting between Macedonian forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas. In return Brussels is offering a \"stabilisation and association agreement\", to be signed by foreign ministers in Luxembourg a week today, the first step towards EU membership for the tiny former Yugoslav republic. Croatia is the only other Balkan state promised such a deal, at last November's Zagreb summit. EU leaders, well placed sources said, bluntly told President Trajkovski in Stockholm last weekend to exercise restraint while fighting the ethnic Albanian UCK (national liberation army) rebels in the hills above the northern city of Tetovo. \"You have to keep the moderate Albanians on board and isolate the extremists,\" he was warned. \"Any action which could undermine this goal would be a mistake.\" Macedonia says it has now completed the military operation to drive the insurgents out of their mountain hideouts and across the border into UN-governed Kosovo. \"We have accomplished the goal of driving out the terrorists with minimum casualties,\" the prime minister, Ljubco Georgievski, said on Saturday. \"It was a text-book operation and was praised by the international community for its precision and efficiency.\" The EU sees the successful resolution of the Macedonian military operation as due in part to the coherence of its foreign policy and a close working relationship with Nato, despite anger in Skopje that Nato has been lax in policing the Kosovo border. Mr Solana also coordinated policy with the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, and is urging him to visit Skopje. But the feeling is that, at a time of disarray in Washington, this is a Balkan crisis in which Europe can finally take the lead.

The main ethnic Albanian leader, Arben Xhaferi, a key partner in the fragile coalition government, has threatened to quit if his community's demands are not met within a month - leaving men with guns to fight for Albanian rights. Mr Georgievski and other politicians of the ethnic majority are wary of a nationalist backlash from their own constituencies if they concede too much. For this reason Brussels has presented inter-ethnic dialogue as an integral part of the path to EU membership rather than a concession to violence. Ethnic Albanians form as much as a third of Macedonia's 2.2m population and say they are discriminated against in education, employment and politics. EU sources say that rewriting the country's constitution is a key demand, but it is not clear whether the parties are prepared to do that. Under pressure from the EU, the two sides are being asked to achieve within a few weeks what they have failed to do in the 10 years since independence from socialist Yugoslavia in 1991. Mistrust runs deep and ethnic Albanian politicians accuse their Slav colleagues of repeatedly failing to keep their promises. The Slavs, however, say the Albanians keep shifting the goalposts. On Friday, Nato-led peacekeepers detained 30 men of \"military age\", some of them armed, along the hilly and wooded border between Kosovo and Macedonia. What's going on?

The lengthy lead times that can be involved in securing funds - we estimate five months from start to finish - mean that the current turbulence is causing us to re-examine fundamentally our strategy. </p> <p>A critical challenge is to start generating some serious revenue, to demonstrate to investors that the business does have potential. To date, our revenue has been limited to the small transaction fees that we derive from the trial of our service. It is not clear when we will be able to launch the full service, for which we are relying on a banking partner, so we probably have to look elsewhere for more immediate returns. </p> <p>One opportunity lies in using our core system in other applications. We have developed a fairly heavyweight online transaction processing and account management system that has already attracted the attention of an ISP and market broking firm - and this has been without any active marketing. We could focus on developing business-to-business applications of the system, but that might be at the expense of effort in the teen payments space. Finding an appropriate balance between the two will be important. </p> <p>A solution may be to partner with another player in the teen payments industry. We have a bank-based business model that may be complementary with some of the pre-pay card services. It is a difficult direction to open up, but one we are considering. </p> <p>Once potential revenue streams have been explored, attention quickly focuses on cost. We have been prudent from the start.

      "bodyText": "Our financial position at the moment is healthy but we always have an eye on the next round of funding. The lengthy lead times that can be involved in securing funds - we estimate five months from start to finish - mean that the current turbulence is causing us to re-examine fundamentally our strategy. A critical challenge is to start generating some serious revenue, to demonstrate to investors that the business does have potential. To date, our revenue has been limited to the small transaction fees that we derive from the trial of our service. It is not clear when we will be able to launch the full service, for which we are relying on a banking partner, so we probably have to look elsewhere for more immediate returns. One opportunity lies in using our core system in other applications. We have developed a fairly heavyweight online transaction processing and account management system that has already attracted the attention of an ISP and market broking firm - and this has been without any active marketing. We could focus on developing business-to-business applications of the system, but that might be at the expense of effort in the teen payments space. Finding an appropriate balance between the two will be important. A solution may be to partner with another player in the teen payments industry. We have a bank-based business model that may be complementary with some of the pre-pay card services. It is a difficult direction to open up, but one we are considering. Once potential revenue streams have been explored, attention quickly focuses on cost. We have been prudent from the start. To date, the business has been under-budget every month of its existence. There is not a huge amount more we can squeeze but we do have enough cash to last us into next year. The lead times in our industry, from preparing for a full launch to securing next-round funding, mean that these issues have to be resolved now. In the current environment we might have to be radical in order to ensure our survival but by planning ahead we are confident of minimising the risks. \u0095 Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are the co-founders of rools, an online payments service for teenagers.",

So imagine my recent joy, nay euphoria, at finding that Apple has devised iMacs that blend seamlessly into the rural setting of a beautiful summer meadow. Or Battersea Dogs' Home. The iMac's Flower Power and Dalmation designs, shown right here, on these very pages, enable you to remember all the lovely things in life while stuck behind your computer terminal on a dank Wednesday afternoon. </p> <p>But they're not just a pretty face. Oh no. These babies boast all manner of technical wizardry and flippertyjibbets to make your life sweeter still. </p> <p>Wonder, at the magic of iTunes, which allows you to craft your own MP3 files and burn music CDs in its built-in CD burner, when you should be doing some work. The real beauty is that it'll just get on with it, quietly, in the background, like a small and diligent seamstress. You won't even know you're wearing it. What's more, the mighty Harman Kardon Odyssey sound system (which sounds an adventure and a half) will ensure that when Mr Snodgrass goes out for his business luncheon, you can all dance around to Bryan Adams on your desktops. There isn't even a cooler fan to make that unnerving droning sound while Bryan is belting out Summer of 69, because the iMac cools itself calmly and quietly and without any fuss. </p> <p>Marvel at the genius of iMovie 2, an invention that gives you the power to edit your home movies, adding a swish soundtrack and wowing effects such as sepia tones, water ripples and, of course, soft-focus, for those fuzzy-edged on-screen snogging moments.

      "bodyText": "As a girl, I of course love flowers. And dalmations. So imagine my recent joy, nay euphoria, at finding that Apple has devised iMacs that blend seamlessly into the rural setting of a beautiful summer meadow. Or Battersea Dogs' Home. The iMac's Flower Power and Dalmation designs, shown right here, on these very pages, enable you to remember all the lovely things in life while stuck behind your computer terminal on a dank Wednesday afternoon. But they're not just a pretty face. Oh no. These babies boast all manner of technical wizardry and flippertyjibbets to make your life sweeter still. Wonder, at the magic of iTunes, which allows you to craft your own MP3 files and burn music CDs in its built-in CD burner, when you should be doing some work. The real beauty is that it'll just get on with it, quietly, in the background, like a small and diligent seamstress. You won't even know you're wearing it. What's more, the mighty Harman Kardon Odyssey sound system (which sounds an adventure and a half) will ensure that when Mr Snodgrass goes out for his business luncheon, you can all dance around to Bryan Adams on your desktops. There isn't even a cooler fan to make that unnerving droning sound while Bryan is belting out Summer of 69, because the iMac cools itself calmly and quietly and without any fuss. Marvel at the genius of iMovie 2, an invention that gives you the power to edit your home movies, adding a swish soundtrack and wowing effects such as sepia tones, water ripples and, of course, soft-focus, for those fuzzy-edged on-screen snogging moments. Then you can download it onto a video cassette and bore the whole office to tears with the film you made of your second cousin's wedding. Alternatively, you may want to email it to your chums, or broadcast it on the internet for the whole bleeding world to admire. The iMac also has the advantage of the Apple Pro Mouse.

      "bodyText": "Slobodan Milosevic's foolhardy last hurrah exposed deep divisions in the new democratic order in Belgrade between the Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, and the Serbian prime minister Zoran Djindjic's government. Constitutionally, it is the Serbian government which is in charge of investigating, arresting and prosecuting Mr Milosevic for his alleged offences at home, while Mr Kostunica is responsible for foreign policy and carries the can for any decision to transfer the former Yugoslav president to the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague. At the crack of dawn yesterday a reportedly deranged Mr Milosevic gave himself up after Mr Kostunica went to his luxury villa in the Belgrade suburb of Dedinje. He was escorted by one of Mr Milosevic's crony, the indicted war criminal Milan Milutinovic, who still formally remains president of Serbia. All's well that ends well. But it was an agonising two days for the hesitant Mr Kostunica, who has been increasingly exasperating Mr Djindjic and his colleagues. They are in a hurry to start rebuilding Serbia, integrating it with the rest of Europe, and gaining the unqualified support of the west, and in their quest they increasingly see Mr Kostunica, an ardent Serbian nationalist and slow-moving stickler for the letter of the law, as a liability rather than an asset, even though he enjoys immense popularity at home. Vladan Batic, the Serbian justice minister, maintained yesterday that the Yugoslav and Serbian governments were \"100% united\" behind the operation to seize Mr Milosevic, but there was scant evidence of that on Friday night or Saturday morning. The president and the prime minister had to knock heads together at an emergency meeting with security and military chiefs on Saturday afternoon before tackling yesterday's dawn arrest. All the signs are that Mr Kostunica was kept in the dark about Friday night's preparations to pounce, however amateurishly, on the Milosevic fortress. For most of Friday the president was in Geneva, making a speech about the perils of secessionism in what remains of Yugoslavia. Mr Djindjic, meanwhile, affected nonchalance, declaring that the action in Dedinje was routine police work while he was at home watching a video of the Oscar-garlanded Gladiator with his son. The initial bungling in seizing Mr Milosevic was in no small measure due to the conflicting loyalties exhibited by the Serbian commandos who were ordered to go into the villa and the Yugoslav army units guarding the residence. As Yugoslav president, Mr Kostunica is the commander in chief of the armed forces and it was only later that the army stood aside, on his orders. When the police tried to raid the villa and seize Mr Milosevic in the early hours of Saturday, the army guards reportedly handed the keys to the gates to Mr Milosevic's private bodyguards. The army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Nebojsa Pavkovic, a controversial figure who was appointed to his post by Mr Milosevic after commanding the 1998-99 campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, said bluntly that his men were doing their duty by guarding the government villa, formally a military installation. The result was that the frontpage of Saturday morning's Politika newspaper, reflecting the Djindjic camp's views, accused Gen Pavkovic of sabotaging the abortive arrest, and suggested that he was operating at the behest of Mr Kostunica. Senior Djindjic officials said Gen Pavkovic had attempted a \"mini military coup\", and justice ministry officials also blamed him. Although Mr Batic insisted that there was agreement, the justice minister has been discreetly criticising Mr Kostunica for weeks. A similar, if more minor, conflict erupted in Belgrade a week ago when the Djindjic camp quietly arrested the former mayor of the Bosnian town of Prijedor and put him on a plane to the Hague, where he is on a secret list of accused war criminals. It was the first time that Belgrade had arrested and transferred an indicted person to the Hague. Again, Mr Kostunica was kept in the dark and he was livid. He denounced the action as illegal.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of Jewish settlers, bristling with sophisticated weapons and swearing revenge, gathered yesterday for the funeral of a baby girl, whose killing by a Palestinian sniper led to a grotesque battle over her corpse. As Yitzhak Pass was handed the tiny blue-shrouded figure of his 10-month-old daughter Shalhevet among the olive trees at the disputed Tomb of the Patriarchs, the voice over the loudspeaker leading the prayers choked with grief, and girls sobbed into their prayer books. The tomb, where the biblical Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are reputedly buried, lies in the heart of this city, where an enclave of 400 Jewish settlers live in open voiced hatred with 120,000 Palestinians. \"It is not the first time our people have suffered since coming to Hebron,\" said a rabbi. \"But there never was a killing like this - a girl less than a year old falling in a holy place like a soldier.\" In Gaza, the Palestinian security chief, Mohammed Dahlan, demanded the return of five members of Force 17, Yasser Arafat's personal bodyguard, who were arrested by the Israeli army early yester day. Force 17 is accused by the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, of the drive-by shooting of Jewish motorists. The army said six men were seized at a roadblock north of the West Bank city of Ramallah. The Palestinians described it as a kidnapping and also accused Israel of detaining 35 members of their security forces. The 400 settlers of Hebron refused to bury Shalhevet, despite Jewish requirements for a speedy funeral, until Mr Sharon, invaded the Palestinian-ruled hills of Abu Sneineh, from where the fatal shot is believed to have been fired. Yesterday, a week after she was killed, many of the settlers still urged him to retake the ridge. \"The only way we can live in peace here is if we retake Abu Sneineh and all high places in the West Bank,\" Yael Ami-El said. Despite being guarded by two helicopter gunships and hundreds of soldiers, many of the men in the funeral procession carried M-16s with telescopic sights, mini-Uzis and handguns. Dozens wore T-shirts reading: \"No Arabs, no terror,\" and a few lobbed stones through the windows of Palestinian houses along the route. A small cascade of stones fell on the mourners in return. Few Palestinians shed tears for Shalhevet. About 130 of the 455 people who have been killed in the uprising were Palestinians under the age of 18, the latest an 11-year-old Ramallah boy who was also buried yesterday, after being shot in the head by an Israeli soldier. Once again the 40,000 Palestinians of Hebron's old city were under curfew, and many said they dared not look out of their windows for fear of attracting the settlers' wrath. \"We have been unable to move for ages, and they can go wherever they want,\" Muktasseb Metsub said through the coils of barbed wire behind her home.

With a word, she could call in the doctors and save his life.</p> <p>But Mickey Devine was an Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) gunman, and had decided to starve himself to death. It was part of a concerted campaign by republican prisoners in the Maze prison's notorious H-blocks to challenge their categorisation by prison authorities as \"ordinary criminals\". They believed that they should have \"political\" status - and they were prepared to die unless given special rights.</p> <p>It was an agonising situation for the families of those who had embarked on the protest. \"I was his sister, I'd had to be his mammy, and now I was being asked to play God,\" says McCauley, a vivacious woman in her 50s. \"I was 34 years old and all I wanted to do was run away.</p> <p>\"He told me if I took him off hunger strike, he would simply go back on it as soon as he was able, and prolong my agony. When he died I had so many mixed emotions. I did what he wanted but I still wonder whether I did the right thing.\"</p> <p>Bobby Sands was the first hunger striker to die, on May 5, 1981, after 66 days without food. Mickey Devine became the 10th and last when he died on August 20, after 60 days. Those were dark days for Northern Ireland - during the six-month period of the protests, 64 people, 34 of them civilians, were killed in violent incidents outside the prison. Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, refused to give in to the prisoners' demands, saying that she would not be blackmailed by terrorists. In fact, their requests were quietly granted in the ensuing months and while never officially designated as such, paramilitary prisoners were effectively given the special status they had sought. The hunger strikes changed the course of history, setting Sinn Fein on the road to political success and ultimately, many would argue, the peace process.</p> <p>Devine's death elevated him to republican martyrdom. But to McCauley, he was just her baby brother. \"He was an ordinary fella. He didn't have his fate written on his forehead. He had red hair and glasses, and when he was wee he was always fighting. It was a sort of self-defence against being teased,\" she says. \"Daddy died when [Mickey] was 12 in 1966 - the year I got married - and when Mammy died six years later, Mickey moved in with us. To be honest, he was a bit of a nuisance.</p> <p>\"Bloody Sunday [when British paratroopers shot dead 13 unarmed men on a civil rights march in Derry in 1972] made a huge impact on him. Afterwards, I knew he'd got involved. He was going out at odd hours of the night. His politics were not my politics, but I asked no questions.\"</p> <p>Even so, it was a shock for McCauley when her brother was arrested in 1976 and jailed for 12 years for armed robbery. He was sent to the Maze prison outside Belfast, which republicans still call by its former name of Long Kesh, and joined the \"dirty protest\", in which inmates refused to wear prison uniform, wrapped themselves in blankets and smeared their excrement on the walls.</p> <p>Devine took part in the brief hunger strike of 1980, which was called off without fatalities. But by the time he told his sister he would be joining the second campaign, three weeks before he started refusing food, four men were already dead. \"I held his hands and my eyes just filled up and there were knots in my stomach, but no words came.\"</p> <p>Each time she made the four-hour round-trip from Derry for weekly visits, they would talk about everything but his impending death. As he grew weaker, she stayed with friends in Belfast, visiting him every day.</p> <p>Devine married at 18 but prison had broken up the marriage, a common situation. But McCauley was determined that his two children, Michael, seven, and Louise, five, would remain close to their father, and she took them to see him regularly.</p> <p>\"When the time came for them to say goodbye, I lifted one on either side of his bed. I put his hands on their heads and told him which was which, as he could no longer see. He stroked their hair and their little faces and he whispered how much he loved them. As I led them out of the room, I turned back and he was just lying there, a skeleton, the tears running down his face.\"</p> <p>The night before her brother died, McCauley went to a small chapel in Belfast and prayed that he would die quickly. He lapsed into unconsciousness at 5am next morning and died in her arms at 7.50am. It was a time of conflict with the Roman Catholic church, and many priests would not allow paramilitary trappings into their chapels, so McCauley complied with her brother's last wishes, leaving his flag-draped coffin in her house while mourners attended the funeral mass. \"I felt so alone,\" she says. \"Even though the other hunger strikers' families have been so good to me, I just couldn't talk to friends about how I felt.\"</p> <p>Twenty years on, McCauley is still close to her nephew and niece. Michael, 27, works with computers, and Louise, 25, is expecting her fifth child. But the intervening years have also been shadowed by tragedy. Three years ago, as she prepared to attend the funeral of the mother of another hunger striker, Kevin Lynch, McCauley received a phone call telling her there had been a chip pan fire at the home of her only son, Jody. He, his wife, and two of their children died. Only the youngest, four- year-old Jade, survived, but only after months in hospital with third-degree burns.</p> <p>\"I had been known for years as Mickey Devine's sister. Now I was Jade McCauley's granny. I was defined by these two tragedies, and yet I am one of the happiest, most positive people I know. God makes the back to bear the burden.\"</p> <p>A few yards from McCauley's home is a windswept graveyard, with a panoramic view of Derry and the river Foyle. Her brother is buried at the republican memorial, a masked paramilitary figure at the top of the hill. Several rows down is the headstone she designed for her son and his family. \"Sometimes, when I meet a man about the age Mickey would be now - 46 - and he says 'I knew your brother, I was in the Kesh with him', I wonder, what would our Mickey look like now?</p> <p>\"And I wish all the people in those photos could come down from my walls and see each other, just for one hour, so that Mickey could meet his grandchildren and my grandchildren.

      "byline": "Gareth McLean",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Dervla Kirwan is quite the unique actress. For a start, when we meet for our interview over lunch, she actually orders something to eat. When her monkfish kebab thing and medley of vegetables arrive, she actually eats them. And then she orders dessert and eats that too. (Admittedly, the dessert is fruit salad and she has peppermint tea and a glass of still water to accompany her meal, but gin and monkfish don't really go, do they?) </p> <p>Then there's her candour. In a business where actors trot out \"I loved the writing\" and \"I took this part because it was such a challenge\" as their rationale for working, when really they did it for the dosh, Kirwan is refreshingly frank. The actress, whose name was made by playing Assumpta Fitzgerald in Ballykissangel, embarked upon her latest project with no illusions. </p> <p>\"Graham Theakston, with whom I worked on The Dark Room [a BBC1 adaptation of the Minette Walters novel], was directing The Bombmaker and asked me if I was interested. I could see all the pitfalls in the script, but female characters who dominate like Andrea are few and far between. Whatever flaws there are, you owe it to yourself to do it. I've made a lot of mistakes in my career but the biggest mistake I've made is to turn down work. And I read Stephen Leather's book on which it was based, knew it was a bestseller and I think my commercial head took over.\" </p> <p>Kirwan isn't daft. In The Bombmaker, she has found a very commercial vehicle. In it, she plays Andrea Hayes, a Dublin wife and mother whose past - as an IRA bombsmith - comes back to haunt her when her daughter is kidnapped. As a ransom, the abductors demand Andrea's services in the creation of a giant bomb which they plan to detonate in the City of London. If Andrea refuses, she will never see her daughter - an impossibly cute munchkin named Katie, complete with blonde ringlets - again. Thus she has to choose between the life of her daughter and the lives of thousands of people who could be caught in the bomb blast. Much handwringing and racing against time ensues. </p> <p>The Bombmaker isn't gritty, cutting edge drama but then, it's not supposed to be. Mark Freeland, controller of drama and comedy at Sky One, describes it in terms of the ripping novel you would read on a transatlantic flight. \"You're not going to read Jane Austen, you're going to read stuff that's genuinely going to grip you right from the off.\" </p> <p>And that sums up The Bomb maker. It is a fairly gripping, reasonably high-octane thriller, which wouldn't look at all out of place on BBC1 or ITV. (Of course, on the BBC, it would have been ruined by having Amanda Burton in the title role.) While ably supported by Mark Womack as her husband, and Samantha Bond as a Special Branch/British intelligence type, The Bombmaker is undoubtedly Kirwan's show, proving she is a bankable star who can carry a drama. As Andrea, she provides real emotional ballast to what otherwise might have been a terrorist-of-the-week, made-for-TV movie. Kirwan's achievement is particularly impressive since she manages all this in a boilersuit, while around her people are madly overacting in balaclavas. </p> <p>Were that not enough to test her mettle, one of Boyzone turns up as a policeman and haunting Irish music strikes up at poignant moments, leading you to wonder whether Clannad are perched just out of shot, fingers poised on fiddles. And as the star of Sky One's flagship homegrown drama for the spring/summer season, she stares out intently from the cover of the channel's glossy promo brochure. She says she didn't think twice about doing work for the satellite broadcaster. </p> <p>\"If Sky approach you and ask you to work for them, it'd be stupid not to say yes. As an actress who has been on BBC1 and BBC2, ITV and Channel 4, it's good to be involved in another network, and one which sells its products all round the world. You do have to think of the business side. I am all for high art but I owe it to myself to be clever about it and do commercial things too.\" </p> <p>So far, she's not doing too badly. Since Assumpta left Ballykissangel - dead - Kirwan has made some interesting, calculated choices. As well as The Dark Room, for which she shaved her head and screamed a lot, she has done political satire (Mr White Goes To Westminster), cuddly Christmas drama (The Greatest Store In The World and The Flint Street Nativity) and complex, well- writ ten relationship dramas (Eureka Street and Hearts And Bones). With The Bombmaker, Kirwan says she wants to attract a different audience to her work. \"It's about international terrorism and the New World Order, and those are things you wouldn't normally associate with a drama with Dervla Kirwan in it.\" </p> <p>But behind all this businesslike bombast, Kirwan just wants to act. \"Ballykissangel made me a household name, and I am enormously grateful for that, but I don't feel it would ever have developed me into a better actress had I stayed. I'll be 30 this year and now, I feel so much more confident with so much more to give as an actress. You can ask a 24-year-old actress to play a 30-year-old woman and she can, but she can't possibly bring to it the wealth of experience a woman of that age has.\" </p> <p>Kirwan attributes some of her sanguine reflection to her upcoming birthday, which she admits in a most un-actressy way. \"A lot of actresses say they are 24 when they are 34 but I find that ridiculous. I wish we didn't succumb to the youth-is-all ideology in this industry, because there is a huge audience out there who want to relate to characters of their own age played by actors of their own age. If you're ever going to get rid of that youth-centric attitude, there have to be people out there who will say, 'Hey, I'm whatever age and I'm a better actress for it.'\" </p> <p>She is equally forthright about fame, having become almost as famous for her private life as for her work on Ballykissangel, when she and co-star Stephen Tompkinson became an item. The pair are no longer together and Kirwan is in a new relationship with actor Darren Boyd. </p> <p>\"Looking back on that, I can understand why the machine around the show turned our relationship into a fairy tale for the media. If I was then the woman I am now, I would have put a stop to it, but I was a 23-year-old girl. I don't think I would be the person I am now without having had that experience. However, I haven't made the mistake of being a celebrity to get work. I think I am an actress first and foremost, but I am aware of the celebrity side of the business.\" </p> <p>So aware, in fact, she is dismissive of her peers who have faux-disdain for what she calls \"the fame game\". \"I buy celebrity magazines and I enjoy reading them. It doesn't make me less of an intellectual, it makes me human. I love asinine interviews with people. I've done them. And I've done photoshoots wearing flimsy dresses. It's a laugh. I've never been so famous that I've walked down the street and people have hassled me, or I've had the paparazzi outside my door. That on a continuous basis would be terrible, but if you're going to live by the sword, you die by the sword. You have to come to terms with that.\" </p> <p>Kirwan has had 15 years to get used to the limelight. Born in Churchtown, Dublin, the youngest of three sisters, she inherited her mother's love of theatre and was 15 when she landed her first role in the BBC drama Troubles. A year later, she starred in Wexford Trilogy by Billy Roche at The Bush Theatre, reprising the roles when the plays were adapted for television. Then came stints at the Royal Court, the Cockpit Theatre, the Globe and the Tricycle. In 1992, she played opposite Ronald Pickup in Melvyn Bragg's A Time To Dance before playing Phoebe in Goodnight Sweetheart. She has returned to comedy lately, guest-starring in Randall And Hopkirk (Deceased) just before starting rehearsals for a new series of Hearts And Bones. In the next 18 months, she says she'd like to do some theatre. </p> <p>\"I have spent half my life in the business and I want longevity. I want to produce [she has just acquired the rights to a novel] as well as act. I hope that in the future, I can strike a balance between doing great, interesting TV and unashamedly commercial stuff. And why not? We are here to entertain. This is a job which demands leaps of faith. Why play safe all the time?\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Bombmaker, Sky One, Sunday 8th April, 9pm</p>",

      "body": "<p>When critics say that a work contains impressive \"set pieces\", it's generally a sneer, suggesting achievement in moments rather than the whole. But writing for the screen depends on key scenes. As viewers, we remember the jobless Yosser Hughes banging his head against the wall in The Boys From The Blackstuff, the sinister CIA man singing as he drinks late at night with Bob Peck's cop in Edge Of Darkness, the long speech by the head of the claims tribunal in Alan Bennett's Kafka drama The Insurance Man - about people's desire to be compensated for loss of happiness. Played as a taster at awards ceremonies, they instantly show those who didn't see the series why the prize is being given. </p> <p>There are three scenes in the opening episode of the second series of Clocking Off (BBC1) which, though only amounting to a minute or so in the hour of action, establish why Paul Abbot is regarded as one of TV's most remarkable new dramatists. As a general rule, playwrights have their heads filled with speeches, while TV and movie writers have imaginations teeming with scenes. It would surprise me if Abbot hadn't built the story around this trio of set-pieces. </p> <p>Set in a Manchester factory which makes bed linen, Clocking Off is unusual in TV fiction terms for operating a shift pattern: a different employee is the central character each week. In this episode, the dramatic foreman is Kev Leach (Jack Deam), a laddish fabric cutter whose life centres on beer and Man U, but who is wandering into marriage with his girlfriend. As the opening credits run, Kev notices that a work-mate, Brian Pringle (Paul Oldham), has moved into the house across the road. </p> <p>A fiction-writer needs, among other things, to be a smuggler, disguising explosive material to look like something else, so we cheerfully wave it through and are then amazed to hear a bang. This meeting on the street looks like a piece of script-writing putty - setting up, perhaps, competition over Kev's hairdresser girlfriend, Babs Fisher (Ashley Jensen) - but is actually dynamite. </p> <p>The fuse is lit in the first of the three crucial scenes. Kev and Babs have just made love. She's post-coitally painting her toe-nails - \"I've got to wear sandals tomorrow\" - and he can't stand the smell, so gets out of bed. The nail varnish, and Bab's rationale, are typically original Abbot touches; a lesser writer would have used a cigarette. Kev reaches for a video camera. Babs says she isn't staying and, anyway, he's out of tape. At least some of the audience is surely supposed to think ill of Kev here, using his lover in private porn, but Abbot is declaring the crate of whisky at Customs in the hope that we won't look under the tarpaulin in the back of the van. </p> <p>Kev tells Babs that all he wants is the zoom lens. He's going to spy on Brian, who's sitting at a computer in his room directly opposite. \"This time of night, it must be porn. Sad git.\" This is Rear Window for the Loaded generation. Deam conjures for Kev a slow smile of wolfish complicity, getting off on the idea of watching his mate watching women. What Kev sees on his work-mate's PC, though, is not tits but kids. Subsequently, a scene of a child cycling towards Brian's house, which would generally be peripheral, becomes a moment of high tension. </p> <p>The excellent American thriller Arlington Road asked the question: \"What if you thought your neighbour was a terrorist?\" Abbot's script is an English equivalent, positing a paedophile across the street. The plots touch on the deepest current neuroses in each country: national security in the US, child safety here. </p> <p>This bedroom scene reveals Abbot's most important dramatic gifts: narrative surprise and moral complexity. It's crucial that his hero isn't entirely clean. If the computer screen had shown a naked woman and an alsation, he'd probably have smiled. Similar psychological sophistication is shown in the next big narrative building block. In the works canteen, the day after Kev's Rear Window moment, Brian is telling a dirty joke. Kev stares at him with fearful hatred. It's clear that, 24 hours earlier, Kev would have been part of the slavering chorus waiting for the punchline. His disapproval isn't feminist. He despises his friend for posing, acting as one of the boys. </p> <p>In this already layered writing, there's even another, final level at which Kev resents the fact that Brian is more popular at work than him. This becomes explicit in the last of the script's vital trinity of events. In a work's football match, Brian's swaggering run - acting, again, as one of the lads - prompts from Kev a violent off-the-ball tackle. This, once again, is a subtle variation on what we might expect: a punch outside a pub. </p> <p>The episode (directed by Ashley Pearce and produced by Juliet Charlesworth) resolves these issues ambiguously but truthfully and without showing anything which might arouse the wrong reaction in a section of the audience. A critic once wrote that great scenes don't make a great play, but no drama stands a chance without them, and this hour of television contains three of the best you will see.</p> <p>\u0095 Clocking Off, tonight, 9pm, BBC1</p>",

As the opening credits run, Kev notices that a work-mate, Brian Pringle (Paul Oldham), has moved into the house across the road. A fiction-writer needs, among other things, to be a smuggler, disguising explosive material to look like something else, so we cheerfully wave it through and are then amazed to hear a bang. This meeting on the street looks like a piece of script-writing putty - setting up, perhaps, competition over Kev's hairdresser girlfriend, Babs Fisher (Ashley Jensen) - but is actually dynamite. The fuse is lit in the first of the three crucial scenes. Kev and Babs have just made love. She's post-coitally painting her toe-nails - \"I've got to wear sandals tomorrow\" - and he can't stand the smell, so gets out of bed. The nail varnish, and Bab's rationale, are typically original Abbot touches; a lesser writer would have used a cigarette. Kev reaches for a video camera. Babs says she isn't staying and, anyway, he's out of tape. At least some of the audience is surely supposed to think ill of Kev here, using his lover in private porn, but Abbot is declaring the crate of whisky at Customs in the hope that we won't look under the tarpaulin in the back of the van. Kev tells Babs that all he wants is the zoom lens. He's going to spy on Brian, who's sitting at a computer in his room directly opposite. \"This time of night, it must be porn. Sad git.\" This is Rear Window for the Loaded generation. Deam conjures for Kev a slow smile of wolfish complicity, getting off on the idea of watching his mate watching women. What Kev sees on his work-mate's PC, though, is not tits but kids. Subsequently, a scene of a child cycling towards Brian's house, which would generally be peripheral, becomes a moment of high tension. The excellent American thriller Arlington Road asked the question: \"What if you thought your neighbour was a terrorist?\" Abbot's script is an English equivalent, positing a paedophile across the street. The plots touch on the deepest current neuroses in each country: national security in the US, child safety here. This bedroom scene reveals Abbot's most important dramatic gifts: narrative surprise and moral complexity. It's crucial that his hero isn't entirely clean. If the computer screen had shown a naked woman and an alsation, he'd probably have smiled. Similar psychological sophistication is shown in the next big narrative building block. In the works canteen, the day after Kev's Rear Window moment, Brian is telling a dirty joke. Kev stares at him with fearful hatred. It's clear that, 24 hours earlier, Kev would have been part of the slavering chorus waiting for the punchline. His disapproval isn't feminist. He despises his friend for posing, acting as one of the boys. In this already layered writing, there's even another, final level at which Kev resents the fact that Brian is more popular at work than him. This becomes explicit in the last of the script's vital trinity of events. In a work's football match, Brian's swaggering run - acting, again, as one of the lads - prompts from Kev a violent off-the-ball tackle. This, once again, is a subtle variation on what we might expect: a punch outside a pub. The episode (directed by Ashley Pearce and produced by Juliet Charlesworth) resolves these issues ambiguously but truthfully and without showing anything which might arouse the wrong reaction in a section of the audience. A critic once wrote that great scenes don't make a great play, but no drama stands a chance without them, and this hour of television contains three of the best you will see. \u0095 Clocking Off, tonight, 9pm, BBC1",

Bitter ex-army colonel Jack Hawkins gathers a gang of rogues and misfits and sets about a \u00a31m bank robbery with a military precision that is matched by the efficiency of the production. Such a pity crime wasn't allowed to pay in those days. The quality cast includes Richard Attenborough, Nigel Patrick, Roger Livesey and Bryan Forbes. </p> <p><strong> Entrapment </strong> (Jon Amiel, 1999) 10pm, Sky Premier: Sean Connery once gave up James Bondage for more serious matters, but here finds himself back in much the same business: a slick, glossy, no-expense-spared action movie in which Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a high-class Bond babe. He's a master thief, she's an officer of the law out to entrap him, but falling for his grey charm. </p> <p><strong> Rush Hour</strong> (Brett Ratner, 1998) 11.25pm, Sky MovieMax: The indestructible Jackie Chan bounces back for more martial arts mayhem. He plays a Hong Kong supercop arriving in LA to find the kidnapped daughter of an old pal; Chris Tucker is the local detective assigned to keep him out of trouble, and matching with sheer word-power Chan's acrobatic fighting skills. Amid the usual frenetic, beautifully choreographed action scenes, Ken Leung makes a worthy, high-kicking adversary, but the best of it is in the chalk-and-cheese pairing of Chan and Tucker. </p> <p><strong> The Devil's Advocate</strong> (Taylor Hackford, 1997) 1.15am, FilmFour: Keanu Reeves is hotshot lawyer Kevin Lomax, who gets an offer he can't refuse: to earn mega-bucks working for a big New York firm. His boss is one John Milton (there's clue one) and he's played by devilish Al Pacino (there's clue two). Yep, it's Satan himself, and soon the company's dark dealings are making even greedy Kevin sit up and blink. Has he sold his soul, or merely leased it? More daft than dark, the whole project is as enjoyably over-the-top as Pacino's cackling, mad-eyed demon. <br><strong> Paul Howlett </strong></p> <p> <strong>Sports </strong></p> <p><strong> Live Football</strong> 7pm, Sky Sports 1 Two of the season's most unlikely challengers for a European place meet in a potentially vital encounter. Southampton were rocked last week by the defection of their manager, Glenn Hoddle, to Tottenham just as their season was looking really interesting. Ipswich, meanwhile, have been a model of stability with George Burley at the helm since 1994. But the Saints are very hard to beat at home - no one has done so since November, and they have won their last five league games without conceding a goal. <br><strong> Simon Burnton </strong></p> <p><strong> Entertainment </strong></p> <p><strong> First Wave</strong> 9pm,Sci Fi: Traci Lords comes aboard for the third series of this sci-fi conspiracy show,as a millionaire militia leader who's been inspired by Cade Foster's battle with the aliens.

      "bodyText": "Films The League Of Gentlemen (Basil Dearden, 1960) 6pm, FilmFour: Proof that the Brits could pull off a heist movie to match the Americans. Bitter ex-army colonel Jack Hawkins gathers a gang of rogues and misfits and sets about a \u00a31m bank robbery with a military precision that is matched by the efficiency of the production. Such a pity crime wasn't allowed to pay in those days. The quality cast includes Richard Attenborough, Nigel Patrick, Roger Livesey and Bryan Forbes. Entrapment (Jon Amiel, 1999) 10pm, Sky Premier: Sean Connery once gave up James Bondage for more serious matters, but here finds himself back in much the same business: a slick, glossy, no-expense-spared action movie in which Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a high-class Bond babe. He's a master thief, she's an officer of the law out to entrap him, but falling for his grey charm. Rush Hour (Brett Ratner, 1998) 11.25pm, Sky MovieMax: The indestructible Jackie Chan bounces back for more martial arts mayhem. He plays a Hong Kong supercop arriving in LA to find the kidnapped daughter of an old pal; Chris Tucker is the local detective assigned to keep him out of trouble, and matching with sheer word-power Chan's acrobatic fighting skills. Amid the usual frenetic, beautifully choreographed action scenes, Ken Leung makes a worthy, high-kicking adversary, but the best of it is in the chalk-and-cheese pairing of Chan and Tucker. The Devil's Advocate (Taylor Hackford, 1997) 1.15am, FilmFour: Keanu Reeves is hotshot lawyer Kevin Lomax, who gets an offer he can't refuse: to earn mega-bucks working for a big New York firm. His boss is one John Milton (there's clue one) and he's played by devilish Al Pacino (there's clue two). Yep, it's Satan himself, and soon the company's dark dealings are making even greedy Kevin sit up and blink. Has he sold his soul, or merely leased it? More daft than dark, the whole project is as enjoyably over-the-top as Pacino's cackling, mad-eyed demon. Paul Howlett Sports Live Football 7pm, Sky Sports 1 Two of the season's most unlikely challengers for a European place meet in a potentially vital encounter. Southampton were rocked last week by the defection of their manager, Glenn Hoddle, to Tottenham just as their season was looking really interesting. Ipswich, meanwhile, have been a model of stability with George Burley at the helm since 1994. But the Saints are very hard to beat at home - no one has done so since November, and they have won their last five league games without conceding a goal. Simon Burnton Entertainment First Wave 9pm,Sci Fi: Traci Lords comes aboard for the third series of this sci-fi conspiracy show,as a millionaire militia leader who's been inspired by Cade Foster's battle with the aliens. Of course,they don't get on at first; then they do - but will the Antichrist get in the way of their love-on-the-run? Richard Vine",

An experimenter, his cross-genre forms predated contemporary music's open-handed swapping of idioms and methods by decades.

A classical pianist from early childhood - his mother, who died when the boy was four, was a trained singer - Lewis studied music and anthropology at the University of New Mexico, met the pioneering bebop drummer Kenny Clarke on military service in Europe, and moved to New York after the war at Clarke's urging. Clarke's presence in Dizzy Gillespie's revolutionary postwar bop-influenced big band brought an offer to Lewis too - and soon, his mix of bop's advanced harmonies, classical devices, and Count Basie's minimalist melodic approach brought him freelance work with Charlie Parker, Lester Young, Illinois Jacquet, Ella Fitzgerald, King Pleasure and others.</p> <p>At the end of the 1940s, Lewis participated in the famous Birth of the Cool sessions with Miles Davis, in which the trumpeter mirrored some of Lewis's gathering fascination with softer dynamics, classical textures, and more complex formal structures.

      "body": "<p>David \"Rocky\" Rocastle, the footballer, who has died from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma aged 33, perhaps never quite came to terms with his ejection from Arsenal. That he is still well remembered and admired at Highbury was shown when the 38,000 crowd at Arsenal stadium, before the North London derby match with Tottenham Hotspur, observed a minute's silence without the faintest interruption. Even David Pleat, manager of Tottenham for the day, remarked that he was happily surprised. Before the game he had suggested to the referee, Paul Durkin, that he blow his whistle as soon as there was any interruption to the silence, believing as he did that football crowds, in such circumstances, could seldom observe more than half a minute.</p> <p>Born in Lewisham, south-east London, Rocastle, a fast, skilled, powerful outside right who won 14 caps for England, was one of three black players from the same area who played a crucial part in the Gunners' success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Rocastle, the clever playmaker Paul Davis and the powerful midfielder Michael Thomas represented a new and positive trend at Highbury, following, in a sense, on the Irish \"tendency\", as represented by David O'Leary, Frank Stapleton and Liam Brady.</p> <p>Rocastle joined Arsenal as an apprentice in August 1983, turned professional with them on December 31 1984, and remained at Highbury until, deeply against his wishes, he was transferred to Leeds United in July 1992.</p> <p>He played a leading role in Arsenal's conquest of the League Championship of 1988-1989, not least in their extraordinary decisive victory over Liverpool at Anfield in the final match of the League season. It was one which they had to win to take the title, and this they did with a goal at the last gasp by Michael Thomas. A famous photograph showed Thomas and Rocastle joyfully celebrating at the final whistle. In that championship season, Rocastle played 38 games, scoring just half a dozen goals. In the 1990-91 season, when Arsenal won the championship again, he played 13 full games, made three appearances as substitute and scored a couple of goals.</p> <p>One great disappointment was that he missed playing for England in the 1990 World Cup in Italy. He was one of 26 players chosen by the manager, Bobby Robson, to go to training camp before the tournament, but when push came to shove, he was one of four dropped from the official 22-man squad.</p> <p>Altogether, Rocastle made 204 appearances for Arsenal in the League, plus 14 as substitute, scoring 24 goals. He helped them to win the Football League Cup in 1987 and was in the team beaten in the 1988 Final. His overall total of games in all tournaments for Arsenal was 260, with 17 appearances as substitute, scoring 34 goals. From such statistics, it will be seen that, despite a strong, right-footed shot, he specialised in making opportunities from the wing for other players. It would be wrong to call him, generically, a midfielder.

      "bodyText": "David \"Rocky\" Rocastle, the footballer, who has died from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma aged 33, perhaps never quite came to terms with his ejection from Arsenal. That he is still well remembered and admired at Highbury was shown when the 38,000 crowd at Arsenal stadium, before the North London derby match with Tottenham Hotspur, observed a minute's silence without the faintest interruption. Even David Pleat, manager of Tottenham for the day, remarked that he was happily surprised. Before the game he had suggested to the referee, Paul Durkin, that he blow his whistle as soon as there was any interruption to the silence, believing as he did that football crowds, in such circumstances, could seldom observe more than half a minute. Born in Lewisham, south-east London, Rocastle, a fast, skilled, powerful outside right who won 14 caps for England, was one of three black players from the same area who played a crucial part in the Gunners' success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Rocastle, the clever playmaker Paul Davis and the powerful midfielder Michael Thomas represented a new and positive trend at Highbury, following, in a sense, on the Irish \"tendency\", as represented by David O'Leary, Frank Stapleton and Liam Brady. Rocastle joined Arsenal as an apprentice in August 1983, turned professional with them on December 31 1984, and remained at Highbury until, deeply against his wishes, he was transferred to Leeds United in July 1992. He played a leading role in Arsenal's conquest of the League Championship of 1988-1989, not least in their extraordinary decisive victory over Liverpool at Anfield in the final match of the League season. It was one which they had to win to take the title, and this they did with a goal at the last gasp by Michael Thomas. A famous photograph showed Thomas and Rocastle joyfully celebrating at the final whistle. In that championship season, Rocastle played 38 games, scoring just half a dozen goals. In the 1990-91 season, when Arsenal won the championship again, he played 13 full games, made three appearances as substitute and scored a couple of goals. One great disappointment was that he missed playing for England in the 1990 World Cup in Italy. He was one of 26 players chosen by the manager, Bobby Robson, to go to training camp before the tournament, but when push came to shove, he was one of four dropped from the official 22-man squad. Altogether, Rocastle made 204 appearances for Arsenal in the League, plus 14 as substitute, scoring 24 goals. He helped them to win the Football League Cup in 1987 and was in the team beaten in the 1988 Final. His overall total of games in all tournaments for Arsenal was 260, with 17 appearances as substitute, scoring 34 goals. From such statistics, it will be seen that, despite a strong, right-footed shot, he specialised in making opportunities from the wing for other players. It would be wrong to call him, generically, a midfielder. He was very much in the tradition of Arsenal outside-rights, from Joe Hulme and Alf Kirchen onwards. When Rocastle was transferred to Leeds, Paul Davis recalled: \"He cried. We spoke about it quite often. He couldn't understand why they ever wanted him to go. The club's line was that he was injured, he was struggling with his weight, he'd had a knee operation. I don't think he ever recovered from the fact of leaving Arsenal, in his own mind.\" Davis will always remember Rocky as \"a bubbly character, lovely spirit, fantastic spirit.

In January 1997, he went, for a spell, to Norwich City, signed for Hull City in October 1997 and finished his playing career in Malaysia. Pleasant, modest and humorous, it was hard to upset him on or off the field. Alan Hansen relates that when, playing against him for Liverpool, he brought him down quite badly, Rocastle merely smiled at him and asked: \"Getting old?\" He leaves a wife, Janet, and three children. \u0095 David Rocastle, footballer, born May 2 1967; died March 31 2001",

A hi-tech engineering solution is being sought urgently, to help archaeologists deal with the disastrous consequences of the wettest winter since records began, and the aftermath of centuries of curiosity about the largest manmade hill in Europe. The mound, which is within sight of the great henge and stone circle at Avebury, is over 4,700 years old, but archaeologists have no idea why it was built. It is estimated to have taken 35m baskets of chalk rubble and earth, and up to a century to build, but its purpose remains an enigma. Despite a wealth of legends, including one of a great king buried on horseback, no trace of any chamber or burial has ever been found. A shaft dug by an 18th century amateur archaeologist collapsed last year, and although it has partly filled up with soil and rubble it has also widened. Further cracks have been detected during the past winter, and archaeologists now fear that the mound, which is pitted with the remains of other holes and shafts, is dangerously unstable. \"It is not good,\" said Amanda Chadburn, an ancient monuments inspector at English Heritage. \"It is causing us concern. You and I might think that you could simply backfill the shaft and close the hole, but our expert engineering advice is that that might just make the whole thing more unstable.\" Ms Chadburn and her team have been climbing to the top of the 40 metre hill every week throughout the winter to monitor its condition, and are alarmed at the evidence of movement. In the 1960s a controlled archaeological excavation seemed to show that the hill was stable and that the largest shaft had been securely backfilled. \"I fear now we took false comfort from that,\" Ms Chadburn said. \"It could be that what we have here is a sort of Swiss cheese, full of holes which cannot be seen from outside, and the danger is that the whole thing could almost implode,\" said Elspeth Henderson, of English Heritage.

Parents whose offspring had the chromosome disorder were told frequently by the Royal Brompton hospital, London, that the risks of heart surgery were not worthwhile, and that the children's condition meant extra pressure on those carers looking after the patients into adulthood. The inquiry team accepts that doctors may not have been intentionally discriminatory over treatment but concludes \"that was, in our opinion, the effect of their approach\". The Down's Syndrome Association said the report vindicated the families who believed they had been discriminated against because of their children's condition, which affects one in 650 babies and leaves one in three of that number with a heart defect. The 400-page report, covering 49 families' complaints, written by a team headed by Ruth Evans, former head of the National Consumer Council, adds that some doctors \"did not focus sufficiently on what was in the best interests of the child as the patient\". The report is also understood to be critical about how parents of children who died after heart surgery were treated by the authorities - a further embarrassment to the medical profession after the Alder Hey organ scandal and the controversial heart procedures at Bristol royal infirmary, on which a report is expected later this year. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, wants to change what he fears is still a paternalistic culture among doctors, shown in their attitude towards patients' families - especially those whose children have died or are surviving with a life-threatening condition. But the criticism from the inquiry about poor communication with parents was balanced by an understanding of the pressure doctors face making life-and-death decisions, and the lack of resources. The treatments by the hospital were said to be consistently satisfactory or good. No one from the Royal Brompton, or its sister hospital at Harefield, where parents had also criticised procedures, is named in the report.

The covert privatisation of the care of the elderly has imposed enormous strains on primary care. Within the past decade, hundreds of geriatric and psychogeriatric beds have been closed. The staff (doctors, nurses and administrative) and other resources have not been transferred into primary care - but the patients have.</p> <p>Since 1990 two nursing homes have opened in our practice area. Effectively, we are now expected to look after around 100 elderly, often seriously physically or mentally ill patients.

      "bodyText": "The Association of Charity Officers has started a debate which should be expanded (Doctors breaking 'free NHS' principle, March 30). The covert privatisation of the care of the elderly has imposed enormous strains on primary care. Within the past decade, hundreds of geriatric and psychogeriatric beds have been closed. The staff (doctors, nurses and administrative) and other resources have not been transferred into primary care - but the patients have. Since 1990 two nursing homes have opened in our practice area. Effectively, we are now expected to look after around 100 elderly, often seriously physically or mentally ill patients. To create that capacity in our local trust would cost hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of pounds. The homes surveyed had charitable status; many don't and aim to profit from the NHS discarding long-term care of the elderly.
