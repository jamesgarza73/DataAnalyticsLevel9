There were six Englishmen in the Manchester United side - two defenders, two midfielders and two forwards - and every one appeared to be worth a place not just in the squad he will announce on Friday morning, but in his starting line-up against Spain next week. Facing a very good Valencia team, they looked magisterial. </p> <p> Unfortunately the removal of one Welshman changed the entire complexion of the performance. After making the opening goal for Andy Cole, Ryan Giggs went straight to the touchline and spoke to United's physiotherapist. Five minutes later he was putting on his jacket, and Nicky Butt was taking his place. </p> <p> With Giggs went the shape and coherence that had shaken the visitors in the opening 15 minutes. As Butt joined Roy Keane and Paul Scholes in patrolling the central areas, gone was the priceless width that had stretched Valencia to breaking point. </p> <p> From that moment United seemed strangely content to sit on their lead, allowing Valencia to come at them and at times living dangerously. For a while this concentration on defence allowed Wes Brown and Gary Neville to demonstrate their competence, the former producing another composed display alongside Jaap Stam at the heart of the rearguard until, with less than five minutes to play, he threw himself at Vicente Rodriguez's low cross from the left and turned the ball inside the near post to give Valencia a thoroughly deserved equaliser. </p> <p> One mistake under pressure ought not to be enough to damage the good opinion which Eriksson will have formed of the young defender's precocious talent, although it may make him think twice about putting Brown on the fast track to a place in the team for the forthcoming World Cup qualifying matches. </p> <p> England's new manager was given another slightly puzzling message by the performance of David Beckham, whose creative contribution waned as his aggression came to the fore in the second half - leading to a booking for a foul on Kily Gonzalez and then, perilously, a ticking-off for a further offence against Ruben Baraja. Bringing his temper under control, Beckham subsequently attracted fouls by Baraja and Amedeo Carboni, both booked for their efforts. </p> <p> Whatever role Eriksson may have mind for Beckham, Sir Alex Ferguson appears in little doubt about his most effective position in United's formation. The No7 started the match in his accustomed place on the right wing, and announced himself with three fine touches in the first five minutes - a silky glance inside, a sumptuous volleyed backheel to Cole, and a ball driven from one touchline to the other which set Mickael Silvestre off on a dribble that provided the first indication of vulnerability in the right flank of the Valencia defence. </p> <p> It was from there United's goal originated, when Giggs made the most of the combined failure of a mix-up between Jocelyn Angloma and Miguel Angel Angulo. The Welshman's reaction to the opportunity was swift and deadly, but Eriksson would have been more interested in the cool aplomb with which Cole put the chance away. Cole's record of no goals in 10 England appearances would appear to put him some way down the queue for a place against Spain, but he looked perfectly comfortable against this opposition. </p> <p> These two sides, equally dedicated to attacking football, will always produce an entertaining match, but whereas Ferguson is reaping the reward of more than a decade of team-building, Hector Cuper has been struggling to replace the attack that took the club to last season's European Cup final. So far the lanky John Carew looks nothing like an adequate replacement for Adrian Ilie, although the 21-year-old Pablo Aimar, acquired this month from River Plate, looks more than promising. </p> <p> Resembling a cross between Georgi Kinkladze and Juninho, the diminutive Aimar saw Kily waste his brilliant first-time flick with a shot over the bar after five minutes, but was as culpable himself 20 minutes later when he sidefooted wide of the far post with only Fabien Barthez to beat. </p> <p> United's inability to hold on to their advantage can be put down to an uncharacteristic willingness to fall into a reliance on counter-attacks, seemingly founded on a belief in their capacity to hold Valencia at bay for more than an hour.

He shoots wide at the far post from six yards after everyone misses a free-kick into the area. 76 GOAL: Anderlecht 1 - 3 Leeds Martyn comes to meet a free-kick, misses it and Koller heads in from 10 yards. 78 Goor does well to pull the ball back from the by-line as Koller fires in another; Martyn saves superbly to tip over. 79 Leeds on the back foot at the moment as Anderlecht pile on the pressure, full of confidence after pulling one back. 81 GOAL: Anderlecht 1 - 4 Leeds De Broek gets a bit over-confident when he climbs all over Viduka in the area and floors him - penalty . Harte steps up to ensure victory for Leeds with a well-struck spot-kick to the left of Milojevic. 83 Substitution Kewell on for Viduka. 89 Anderlecht know the game is up as things become scrappy in the final minutes. Leeds still chasing and closing down however. 90 Leeds have a last crack at a fifth when Harte drifts the ball in to the far post. Full-time. Anderlecht 1 - 4 Leeds Leeds through to the quarter-finals after Real Madrid hold Lazio to a 2-2 draw.",

Enough was enough and I decided to avoid any further embarrassment by sticking to sunbathing.</p> <p>Byron Bay is one of Australia's top holiday spots and in the evening there was a real buzz about the place, with plenty of bars and restaurants and the usual naff clubs you find in coastal resorts. It was also full of English teenagers. The UK must be a rather quiet place at the moment as everyone seems to be over here. I thought this was good at first as I always had plenty in common with the people I met, but it begins to get you down after a while. I realised it was time to move on after I got over-excited when the guy next to me at the bar turned out to be an authentic Australian.</p> <p>I got back on the bus, zipped through a dreary-looking Brisbane, and on up to Hervey Bay, the launch pad for trips to Frazer Island.</p> <p>Frazer Island is the world's largest sandbar (120km by 15km). It has huge drifting sand dunes; crystal clear lakes, and rainforest with an amazing variety of trees and plants. As such, it is on the world heritage list and the northern part is protected by National Park status. There are no paved roads so the only way to explore the island is by four-wheel drive. There are a variety of operators in Hervey Bay itching to help you do this and relieve you of your cash.</p> <p>The two main options are self-drive (where you basically make up a group out of whoever's booked in for that day) or a guided trip where you get taken round in a huge bus with a commentary on the wildlife. I had booked with Frazer Escape who offer something in between. You get to share the driving but a guide comes along to show the way. At A$220, this all-inclusive three-day trip was pretty good value.</p> <p>I was in a group of 20, split between two Toyota land cruisers. We were shown a sobering video of newsclips of some horrific accidents that have happened on the island when trucks have rolled over or crashed into each other. There was also a brief explanation of how to drive the vehicles. Then we packed our food and rucksacks onto the vehicles and set off for the ferry.</p> <p>There were storm winds forecast for that night so the first thing we did on reaching the island was to grab a good campsite. This was where the benefits of having a guide. He knew the best places and we quickly found a sheltered spot off the beach. After setting up our tents, the afternoon was spent at nearby Lake Wabby. This deep little lake was surrounded by dunes on one side and eucalyptus forest on the other. We all sunbathed or splashed about and played frisbee.</p> <p>After dinner we made a fire and sat around chatting and playing drinking games into the night. The key to these sort of trips being successful is the people who are on them. I was lucky enough to be with a really good bunch who all mucked in and had a laugh at the same time.</p> <p>The following days were spent in much the same vein. We drove along the endless, windswept beach past rusting shipwrecks. We swam in more warm, clear lakes. We walked up steep sand dunes and then rolled back down them. We went for hikes in the rainforest and floated down streams back to the beach. We climbed up headlands and tried to spot the man-eating sharks, which make swimming in the sea a no go.</p> <p>The land cruisers were great vehicles and could go anywhere. We would rev down narrow, bumpy tracks, rocking from side to side, everyone in the back hanging on and shouting helpful instructions to the driver. We got stuck in soft sand a couple of times and everybody had to jump out and push but it was all part of the fun.</p> <p>Our guide certainly knew his way round the island but he could have done with learning a thing or two about customer relations. He didn't, for example, bother to try to learn our names. When something needed to be done he would just point and say \"you!\". The company also let themselves down a bit with the accommodation on our return to Hervey Bay. Little things like broken bunk beds and being charged a non-refundable A$1.50 for sheets that you don't need are rather annoying.</p> <p>However, these were only minor complaints and all in all, it was a really good trip to an amazing place with an excellent group of people.</p> <p>Thanks for your emails. I'm glad to see <a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netjetters/sam/feedback/story/0,8580,433811,00.html\">the mystery of my missing duck</a> has been solved. I'd been wondering where he'd flown off to. It's good to know he's enjoying himself back in New York.</p> <p>Next week I'm going on another camping trip, this time into the heart of the outback to see Uluru (Ayers Rock) and then a brief stopover in Perth before reaching Africa. Over the last few days, I've decided to change my route through Africa slightly, so I'll tell you more about that in my next report.</p>",

We were shown a sobering video of newsclips of some horrific accidents that have happened on the island when trucks have rolled over or crashed into each other. There was also a brief explanation of how to drive the vehicles. Then we packed our food and rucksacks onto the vehicles and set off for the ferry. There were storm winds forecast for that night so the first thing we did on reaching the island was to grab a good campsite. This was where the benefits of having a guide. He knew the best places and we quickly found a sheltered spot off the beach. After setting up our tents, the afternoon was spent at nearby Lake Wabby. This deep little lake was surrounded by dunes on one side and eucalyptus forest on the other. We all sunbathed or splashed about and played frisbee. After dinner we made a fire and sat around chatting and playing drinking games into the night. The key to these sort of trips being successful is the people who are on them. I was lucky enough to be with a really good bunch who all mucked in and had a laugh at the same time. The following days were spent in much the same vein. We drove along the endless, windswept beach past rusting shipwrecks. We swam in more warm, clear lakes. We walked up steep sand dunes and then rolled back down them. We went for hikes in the rainforest and floated down streams back to the beach. We climbed up headlands and tried to spot the man-eating sharks, which make swimming in the sea a no go. The land cruisers were great vehicles and could go anywhere. We would rev down narrow, bumpy tracks, rocking from side to side, everyone in the back hanging on and shouting helpful instructions to the driver. We got stuck in soft sand a couple of times and everybody had to jump out and push but it was all part of the fun. Our guide certainly knew his way round the island but he could have done with learning a thing or two about customer relations. He didn't, for example, bother to try to learn our names. When something needed to be done he would just point and say \"you!\". The company also let themselves down a bit with the accommodation on our return to Hervey Bay. Little things like broken bunk beds and being charged a non-refundable A$1.50 for sheets that you don't need are rather annoying. However, these were only minor complaints and all in all, it was a really good trip to an amazing place with an excellent group of people. Thanks for your emails. I'm glad to see the mystery of my missing duck has been solved. I'd been wondering where he'd flown off to. It's good to know he's enjoying himself back in New York. Next week I'm going on another camping trip, this time into the heart of the outback to see Uluru (Ayers Rock) and then a brief stopover in Perth before reaching Africa. Over the last few days, I've decided to change my route through Africa slightly, so I'll tell you more about that in my next report.",

They look at yesterday's Guardian/ICM poll and see a lead stretching into the distance: a 15-point margin at a time when most governments are lucky to be in the low single digits.</p> <p>Or they can glance at the \"poll of polls\" produced by that veteran number-cruncher, Ivor Crewe. His latest average of the competing surveys shows Labour with an even fatter 17-point lead - enough to swell Labour's majority from 179 seats to 229.</p> <p>The Millbankers can slice it whichever way they like, it's still the same story. Labour are more trusted than the Conservatives to handle education, health and transport - and even traditional Tory strong suits like the economy and law and order. On every measure, they win. No postwar government has enjoyed a command like it even Margaret Thatcher's post-Falklands surge in 1983 was not as strong.</p> <p>The private polling, where Labour might tell itself some unwelcome truths, is just as encouraging. Voters still associate the Tories with the bad old days of the early 90s - sky-high interest rates, repossessions, negative equity. Black Wednesday has become the Tories' Winter of Discontent: Labour only has to mention it to scare voters on to their side. Reporters may be bored rigid by hearing Gordon Brown chant \"No return to boom and bust\", but the polls show it works. Yesterday the Halifax did their bit to help, too: their cut in base rates, and the general price war in the mortgage business, all add to the pre-election, feelgood mood.</p> <p>As if Labour's advantage was not great enough already, it has two more weapons at the ready. First, the Millbank crew have had a recent lesson in how not to do it. They watched Al Gore's narrow defeat last year, realising that even a party presiding over economic good times can lose. Gore's mistake, they concluded, was to treat America's prosperity as a given, thereby denying the Democrats credit for their achievement. That's why the Blairite soundbite du jour is that Britain's economic health - record lows in both inflation and unemployment - is the fruit of \"choice, not chance\". Labour refuses to let this election become a debate with the Tories on how to spend it - they want credit for generating the surplus cash in the first place. And, so far, they're getting it.</p> <p>Labour's second nuclear device is William Hague. Polls show the British have warmed to him about as much as they did to Neil Kinnock: they simply do not see him as a plausible prime minister. Indeed, Blair's personal lead over Hague is a whopping 20 points.</p> <p>No blot, it seems, can muddy this landscape. The Tory boomlet of September's fuel protests went as fast as it came. Peter Mandelson's resignation excited the natterers and chatterers of the Westminster village but made no dent on the polls. The Derry Irvine, cash-for-wigs affair adds to the widespread impression of an arrogant Labour administration - but it seems unlikely to shift many votes. Tony Blair must reckon that his is the Teflon government: both the Mandy and Derry episodes would have unravelled John Major, but they seem to wash right off him.</p> <p>Can anything darken this blue sky for Labour? Only one thing: turnout. If Labour's supporters stay at home, confident that victory is theirs, and Conservatives head out, energised by their determination to keep the pound, a gap that should have been a mile-wide could suddenly narrow. That's why Blair's last two big speeches were so blatantly aimed at waking up and motivating Labour voters.</p> <p>In this context there are a couple of distant clouds which, even if they don't threaten to ruin Labour's spring day, could certainly cause the odd unwanted shower. The irony is that both are of the government's own making. Indeed, the source of the trouble is one of Labour's most radical first-term achievements: devolution.</p> <p>It is in Wales that the problem is most obvious. Labour figures there warn that the party could lose between seven and 10 of the 34 Welsh seats they now hold. They cite the 1999 elections for the new Welsh assembly, when Labour lost the iconic strongholds of the Rhondda, Islwyn (Kinnock's old seat) and Llanelli.</p> <p>The explanation is simple. \"You ask people here what they would prefer to have, the national assembly or bubonic plague, and most of them would opt for the latter,\" says one Labour sceptic. He believes the government is now blamed for creating a body - following the narrowest of referendum victories in 1997 - which nobody wants. One recent poll found two-thirds of Welsh voters disapproved of the assembly, with Labour taking the rap. A recent council byelection in Wrexham saw Labour's total vote slump to just 50 - in a seat where its previous majority had been 654.</p> <p>Activists are still smarting over the Alun Michael episode - when Millbank sought to impose its own man as Welsh Labour leader over the people's choice, Rhodri Morgan - and have struggled to recover ever since. Now installed as first minister, Morgan has missed the odd political trick, too: he let himself announce the Corus steel closure in Llanwern, but allowed one of his Liberal Democrat coalition partners to get the glory of revealing that the FA Cup was coming to Cardiff. \"Naff politics,\" sniffs one critic. Punishment could come on polling day, when Welsh voters either defect to Plaid Cymru again - or stay home.</p> <p>In Scotland, Labour has the reverse problem - not that devolution has failed to bed down, but that it has bedded down too comfortably. While the Welsh still doubt the purpose of their assembly, Scots have grown entirely used to their new parliament in Edinburgh: \"It's as if it was always there,\" says one fulltime observer.</p> <p>The result is that a general election for Westminster could feel a very faraway affair. Now that so many key decisions are taken at Holyrood, Labour will have an uphill struggle explaining why the coming poll is even relevant to Scotland. After all, the key Blair themes - education, health and crime - are no longer decided in Westminster at all, but in Edinburgh. If anything, the new dispensation helps the Tories: at least their core issues - Europe and asylum, for example - remain Westminster matters. The one crumb of comfort for Labour is that if the remoteness of the House of Commons hurts them, imagine what it does to the Scottish National party: how on earth will they get their vote out?</p> <p>For wholly opposite reasons - the success of devolution in Scotland, its struggle to take root in Wales - two Labour bastions threaten to spoil the party this spring. It won't be enough to change the final outcome, but it could alter the scale of victory.

In his first public comment on the controversy that has engulfed him since Sunday's revelation that he asked Labour-supporting lawyers to pledge at least \u00a3200 to the government, Lord Irvine of Lairg said: \"I do not believe that I have done anything wrong nor do I believe I have broken any current rules. If I did I would be the first to apologise. \"I would certainly consider doing it again.\" The political wrangle \u0096 which has dominated headlines during the \"phony election\" war \u0096 was sparked when it was revealed he had hosted a fundraising dinner at London's Atlantic Bar and Grill and asked lawyers to donate money for a Labour second term. Tory and Liberal-Democrat critics of the Lord chancellor dubbed it the \"cash for wigs\" scandal as one of Derry Irvine's roles is to appoint QCs, and had called for his resignation. But replying to questions in the House of Lords, the lord chancellor said he was no different to any other cabinet minister and would consider fundraising again. A spokeswoman for prime minister Tony Blair said the lord chancellor retained the full confidence of the prime minister and the accusations would be treated with the contempt they deserved. Liberal Democrat Lord McNally, who tabled a question asking whether \"the role of lord chancellor is compatible with that of a party fundraiser\", said he was disappointed that Lord Irvine did not apologise for the affair. Although the lord chancellor refused to apologise, he did conceed that the row had created negative publicity for the government. He said: \"Whether or not [doing it again] would attract a furore of this kind would be a consideration I would take into account. \"I believe this furore has distracted attention of country from the real issues.\" The fuss centred on the probity of the Lord Chancellor acting a partisan political fund raiser whilst simultaneously being head of the judiciary \u0096 in addition to his Cabinet post and legislative role in the Lords. In an age-old tradition, Lord Irvine was required to take a step away from his seat on the woolsack before answering to demonstrate that he was stepping away from his role as speaker of the Lords and was replying to questions as a cabinet minister. However the lord chancellor did announce that he would favour an independent commissioner to look into judicial appointments. Talk about it Should Lord Irvine resign?

      "trailText": "<p><strong>What makes us different?</strong></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>What makes us different?</strong></p> <p>Where to start? The fanatical belief in our own innate superiority, perhaps, or maybe the unique status accorded us by the footballing Gods, who for some reason decided long ago to mark us out for particularly inequitable treatment? Or is it just that we know we epitomise that old football clich\u00e9, the Sleeping Giant? In truth, none of these attributes can be uniquely applied to the Royals as we share each and every one with the myriad of other small clubs who populate the lower reaches of English professional football. </p> <p>What we also share with many of them is a history steeped in mediocrity and under-achievement. Not qualities you may be inclined to shout about but worn like a veritable badge of pride when confronted with many \"modern\" football fans, whose sudden interest in the game in the last few years extends no further than Sky TV, the Premiership and almost certainly either Man Utd, Arsenal or Chelsea. Not that we think we're special but it's surely a paradox that whilst the Premiership receives most of the attention, the real hotbed of English football support lies in the Nationwide and Conference leagues.</p> <p>As for the Royals (or the Biscuitmen, as a few of us Oldies still prefer), the last few years have seen unprecedented change, not of all of which could be considered for the better. Our fabulous new 25,000-seater stadium may seem totally incongruous in a Second-Division setting but surely hints at potential as yet unfulfilled. The catchment area for both fans and players is enormous, with the nearest other League clubs (Oxford, Swindon, Wycombe, Bournemouth) all at least thirty miles away.</p> <p>And yet, thanks to the pernicious influence of the capital, our fan base has leaked away over the years, principally to Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs. This may also be because of our own lamentable history of failure but it's frustrating none the less.</p> <p><strong>The high points</strong></p> <p>Almost all of Reading's success as a League club has come in the last twenty years or so. Success, of course, is a relative term, as in the last couple of seasons an away win at, say, Chesterfield, would be seized upon as a glorious achievement. When you get used to a diet of unremitting misery, even the merest glimmer can seem like a whole Fort Knox full of gold.</p> <p>Our victory over Luton in the Simod Cup final at Wembley in 1988 is the biggest single success and enough to make us attempt to rig the result of Observer Sport Monthly's recent poll to find the country's top 100 sporting moments. History is never kind to these events as beating Luton today is hardly climbing football's Everest but, in 1988, Luton were a First Division side who recovered from the 4-1 mauling at our hands to beat Arsenal in the final of the League Cup and also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup. </p> <p>Others include the 13 wins in a row at the start of the 1985-86 season (that Fulham failed to equal this year) and the record clean sheets kept by Steve Death back in the 70s.</p> <p><strong>The low points</strong></p> <p>So much to choose from, so little time. Any relegation leaves a bitter taste and a gnawing, empty feeling in the pit of the stomach until the new season starts but at least hope is always there somewhere, however fleeting her appearance may prove to be. The real disasters are those financial crisis that threaten the whole future of the club. </p> <p>For Reading and Oxford fans, the lowest of the low has to be Captain Bob's (Robert Maxwell to the uninitiated) attempt to amalgamate the two clubs under the new banner of the Thames Valley Royals. This all seems like ancient history now but only a few will remember how close the megalomaniac pension thief came to achieving his vile scheme. When will these petty despots realise that messing about with a football club is a dangerous business? The locals, wherever they are, will not go quietly.</p> <p><strong>High point and low point</strong></p> <p>Of course, the most dramatic achievement and the most savage disappointment came in one and the same game. The 4-3 defeat by Bolton in the 1995 play-off final came with the Royals on the verge of our first-ever season in the top flight, courtesy of a 2-0 half-time lead and a dominating performance. We also, as if any Royals' fan needed reminding, missed a bloody penalty. In fact, I can't write about this any more - what did I do with that bottle of scotch?</p> <p><strong>Current position</strong></p> <p>Scrapping like crazy for at least a play-off position in the Second Division, the Royals are still managing to frustrate their loyal supporters. Brilliant one moment, terrible the next, we are the division's answer to Chelsea - a collection of talented individuals who don't quite function as a team when it matters.</p> <p><strong>Last fixture</strong></p> <p>As if to prove a point, a stinker of a home draw against Peterborough. English lower-division football at its worst: all misplaced passes, crunching tackles and defensive cock-ups.</p> <p><strong>Next fixtures</strong></p> <p>Oldham away, Swansea away, then Rotherham at home. What a glamorous life we lead! As play-off rivals, the Rotherham game will be crucial although as The Whiff is sponsoring the match ball that day, we'll probably be too full of \"free\" Bucks Fizz to notice.</p> <p><strong>Sore point</strong></p> <p>With the team performing better than for some years, the protracted (not to say bizarre) contract negotiations with our best player, Darren Caskey, seem odd, to say the very least. Having offered him a deal he was about to accept, the club withdrew having just signed a new player (don't ask). Caskey now apparently wants too much money but is out of contract in June so we'll probably lose him on a Bosman. </p> <p><strong>The chairman</strong></p> <p>What can we say? A man who almost single-handedly rescued the club from near financial oblivion and certainly penury, funded the building of an extraordinary new stadium and turned traditional small timers Reading into one of the Second Division's \"big\" clubs. John Madejski may not be much of a football fan but that makes his contribution all the more remarkable.</p> <p>Of course, it's not very fashionable to praise the chairman, and many in Reading feel that he could and should have committed far more of his vast financial resources. His mistake was in not investing when we were near the top of the First Division, a mistake he has paid very dearly for. Fact is, without him, we'd have nowhere near the resources (he's also funded the Academy), very little hope and possibly not much of a future. </p> <p><strong>Rivals</strong></p> <p>Younger Reading fans will expend a great deal of energy spitting bile and venom at Swindon but, if the truth be known, it's all a bit artificial. Swindon don't give a damn about us and can't understand the fuss. Until they folded, our real rivals were Aldershot but unless we fluke a meeting in the cup, that rivalry is unlikely to be renewed. </p> <p><strong>Kit</strong></p> <p>Despite what QPR fans might say, the Blue and White Hoops belong to us. Why? Quite simply because we got there first. We may have experimented with various abominations during the 80s but our hearts are in the hoops.</p> <p><strong>Mascot</strong></p> <p>The club mascot is a big furry lion called Kingsley. Some time ago, The Whiff uncovered the shocking revelation that it is not, in fact, a real lion but a bloke dressed up in a comedy lion suit. Several of Reading's younger fans had to have the week off school to recover from this news. The faux feline still parades around shamelessly at every game.</p> <p><strong>Popular players</strong></p> <p>The most popular and notorious player in Reading's history is the one and only Robin Friday. Both genius and villain, here was a man who spent the build up to the game in the pub, produced moments of extraordinary vision and skill on the pitch and would then flatten the opposition centre-half following one heavy challenge too many. A real 70s man, if you took Stan Bowles, Rodney Marsh and Alan Hudson, rolled them into one and added a liberal dose of wild Romany, you might get something approaching Robin Friday.</p> <p>With his story already covered in the book The Greatest Footballer You Never Saw, a film is apparently in the offing. Unfortunately, we will never see his like again.</p> <p><strong>Unpopular players</strong></p> <p>For some reason, it seems necessary to pick on one player in every squad and single them out for particular vitriol whenever they appear. Current incumbent of this unfortunate position is Keith Jones whose crime has apparently been to have, er, a couple of bad games. </p> <p><strong>Most ridiculous signing</strong></p> <p>One Boris Mikhailov, the bewigged Bulgarian World Cup goalkeeper, who joined us the season after our glorious failure to reach the Premiership. Now this may be a myth, but he apparently saw the play-off final and thought we played all our home games at Wembley. Elm Park (our old ground) must have been something of a shock to him.</p> <p><strong>Worst-ever manager</strong></p> <p>This category could prove rather contentious. Some may opt for Terry \"the Taxi\" Bullivant, whose one season in charge saw us relegated after losing thirteen of the last fifteen games. Some may go for his replacement, the high-profile Tommy Burns, who tried to turn Reading into a suburb of Glasgow and frittered away millions whilst achieving precisely bugger all. My own vote goes to Ian Porterfield who, in the early 90s, managed to produce a side of such mind-numbing tedium that I had to leave the country for a while just to avoid going to matches.</p> <p><strong>Celebrity fans</strong></p> <p>None, fortunately, since the demise of Israeli spoonbender and all-round arse wipe, Uri Geller. Having embarrassed us with stunts involving telepathy and magic crystals, Geller had the bare-faced cheek to claim that any success we had was down to him and failure was the result of booting him out of the club.</p> <p><strong>The ground</strong></p> <p>Nuff said already. Simply the best outside the Premiership. Possibly.</p> <p><strong>Atmosphere</strong></p> <p>With the home fans still settling in, the crowd can seem quiet and the stadium acoustics do not help. In my personal opinion the lack of nearby boozers does not help - we need a bit more alcohol-fuelled chanting.</p> <p><strong>Local knowledge</strong></p> <p>The stadium might be great, but stuck on industrial park near the motorway, it's not going to win any awards for aesthetic qualities. Indeed, the name of our fanzine, The Whiff, comes from the proximity of the nearby sewage works. The advice has to be: drink in town and get a bus/taxi to the ground. Oh, and don't eat the stadium \"food\", as cooking is an art that hasn't quite yet penetrated the nether reaches of the modern-day concrete bowl.</p> <p><strong>Fanzines</strong></p> <p>With Reading set in the heart of the UK's answer to Silicon Valley, the fanzine community is now almost entirely on the internet. Some of these are very good, especially Hob Nob Anyone?, Offateleven and 1871. </p> <p>The Whiff is now the only paper-based 'zine in existence at Reading, but testimony to the fact that people still want to hold a newspaper or similar in their hands rather than rush home and read it on the net. However, despite our resolutely Luddite approach, we also have a web site at www.thewhiff.com.</p> <p>http://www.royals.cx/ http://www.1871.cx/ http://reading.rivals.net/default.asp?sid=942</p>",

      "bodyText": "What makes us different? Where to start? The fanatical belief in our own innate superiority, perhaps, or maybe the unique status accorded us by the footballing Gods, who for some reason decided long ago to mark us out for particularly inequitable treatment? Or is it just that we know we epitomise that old football clich\u00e9, the Sleeping Giant? In truth, none of these attributes can be uniquely applied to the Royals as we share each and every one with the myriad of other small clubs who populate the lower reaches of English professional football. What we also share with many of them is a history steeped in mediocrity and under-achievement. Not qualities you may be inclined to shout about but worn like a veritable badge of pride when confronted with many \"modern\" football fans, whose sudden interest in the game in the last few years extends no further than Sky TV, the Premiership and almost certainly either Man Utd, Arsenal or Chelsea. Not that we think we're special but it's surely a paradox that whilst the Premiership receives most of the attention, the real hotbed of English football support lies in the Nationwide and Conference leagues. As for the Royals (or the Biscuitmen, as a few of us Oldies still prefer), the last few years have seen unprecedented change, not of all of which could be considered for the better. Our fabulous new 25,000-seater stadium may seem totally incongruous in a Second-Division setting but surely hints at potential as yet unfulfilled. The catchment area for both fans and players is enormous, with the nearest other League clubs (Oxford, Swindon, Wycombe, Bournemouth) all at least thirty miles away. And yet, thanks to the pernicious influence of the capital, our fan base has leaked away over the years, principally to Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs. This may also be because of our own lamentable history of failure but it's frustrating none the less. The high points Almost all of Reading's success as a League club has come in the last twenty years or so. Success, of course, is a relative term, as in the last couple of seasons an away win at, say, Chesterfield, would be seized upon as a glorious achievement. When you get used to a diet of unremitting misery, even the merest glimmer can seem like a whole Fort Knox full of gold. Our victory over Luton in the Simod Cup final at Wembley in 1988 is the biggest single success and enough to make us attempt to rig the result of Observer Sport Monthly's recent poll to find the country's top 100 sporting moments. History is never kind to these events as beating Luton today is hardly climbing football's Everest but, in 1988, Luton were a First Division side who recovered from the 4-1 mauling at our hands to beat Arsenal in the final of the League Cup and also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Others include the 13 wins in a row at the start of the 1985-86 season (that Fulham failed to equal this year) and the record clean sheets kept by Steve Death back in the 70s. The low points So much to choose from, so little time. Any relegation leaves a bitter taste and a gnawing, empty feeling in the pit of the stomach until the new season starts but at least hope is always there somewhere, however fleeting her appearance may prove to be. The real disasters are those financial crisis that threaten the whole future of the club. For Reading and Oxford fans, the lowest of the low has to be Captain Bob's (Robert Maxwell to the uninitiated) attempt to amalgamate the two clubs under the new banner of the Thames Valley Royals. This all seems like ancient history now but only a few will remember how close the megalomaniac pension thief came to achieving his vile scheme. When will these petty despots realise that messing about with a football club is a dangerous business? The locals, wherever they are, will not go quietly. High point and low point Of course, the most dramatic achievement and the most savage disappointment came in one and the same game. The 4-3 defeat by Bolton in the 1995 play-off final came with the Royals on the verge of our first-ever season in the top flight, courtesy of a 2-0 half-time lead and a dominating performance. We also, as if any Royals' fan needed reminding, missed a bloody penalty. In fact, I can't write about this any more - what did I do with that bottle of scotch? Current position Scrapping like crazy for at least a play-off position in the Second Division, the Royals are still managing to frustrate their loyal supporters. Brilliant one moment, terrible the next, we are the division's answer to Chelsea - a collection of talented individuals who don't quite function as a team when it matters. Last fixture As if to prove a point, a stinker of a home draw against Peterborough. English lower-division football at its worst: all misplaced passes, crunching tackles and defensive cock-ups. Next fixtures Oldham away, Swansea away, then Rotherham at home. What a glamorous life we lead! As play-off rivals, the Rotherham game will be crucial although as The Whiff is sponsoring the match ball that day, we'll probably be too full of \"free\" Bucks Fizz to notice. Sore point With the team performing better than for some years, the protracted (not to say bizarre) contract negotiations with our best player, Darren Caskey, seem odd, to say the very least. Having offered him a deal he was about to accept, the club withdrew having just signed a new player (don't ask). Caskey now apparently wants too much money but is out of contract in June so we'll probably lose him on a Bosman. The chairman What can we say? A man who almost single-handedly rescued the club from near financial oblivion and certainly penury, funded the building of an extraordinary new stadium and turned traditional small timers Reading into one of the Second Division's \"big\" clubs. John Madejski may not be much of a football fan but that makes his contribution all the more remarkable. Of course, it's not very fashionable to praise the chairman, and many in Reading feel that he could and should have committed far more of his vast financial resources. His mistake was in not investing when we were near the top of the First Division, a mistake he has paid very dearly for. Fact is, without him, we'd have nowhere near the resources (he's also funded the Academy), very little hope and possibly not much of a future. Rivals Younger Reading fans will expend a great deal of energy spitting bile and venom at Swindon but, if the truth be known, it's all a bit artificial. Swindon don't give a damn about us and can't understand the fuss. Until they folded, our real rivals were Aldershot but unless we fluke a meeting in the cup, that rivalry is unlikely to be renewed. Kit Despite what QPR fans might say, the Blue and White Hoops belong to us. Why? Quite simply because we got there first. We may have experimented with various abominations during the 80s but our hearts are in the hoops. Mascot The club mascot is a big furry lion called Kingsley. Some time ago, The Whiff uncovered the shocking revelation that it is not, in fact, a real lion but a bloke dressed up in a comedy lion suit. Several of Reading's younger fans had to have the week off school to recover from this news. The faux feline still parades around shamelessly at every game. Popular players The most popular and notorious player in Reading's history is the one and only Robin Friday. Both genius and villain, here was a man who spent the build up to the game in the pub, produced moments of extraordinary vision and skill on the pitch and would then flatten the opposition centre-half following one heavy challenge too many. A real 70s man, if you took Stan Bowles, Rodney Marsh and Alan Hudson, rolled them into one and added a liberal dose of wild Romany, you might get something approaching Robin Friday. With his story already covered in the book The Greatest Footballer You Never Saw, a film is apparently in the offing. Unfortunately, we will never see his like again. Unpopular players For some reason, it seems necessary to pick on one player in every squad and single them out for particular vitriol whenever they appear. Current incumbent of this unfortunate position is Keith Jones whose crime has apparently been to have, er, a couple of bad games. Most ridiculous signing One Boris Mikhailov, the bewigged Bulgarian World Cup goalkeeper, who joined us the season after our glorious failure to reach the Premiership. Now this may be a myth, but he apparently saw the play-off final and thought we played all our home games at Wembley. Elm Park (our old ground) must have been something of a shock to him. Worst-ever manager This category could prove rather contentious. Some may opt for Terry \"the Taxi\" Bullivant, whose one season in charge saw us relegated after losing thirteen of the last fifteen games. Some may go for his replacement, the high-profile Tommy Burns, who tried to turn Reading into a suburb of Glasgow and frittered away millions whilst achieving precisely bugger all. My own vote goes to Ian Porterfield who, in the early 90s, managed to produce a side of such mind-numbing tedium that I had to leave the country for a while just to avoid going to matches. Celebrity fans None, fortunately, since the demise of Israeli spoonbender and all-round arse wipe, Uri Geller. Having embarrassed us with stunts involving telepathy and magic crystals, Geller had the bare-faced cheek to claim that any success we had was down to him and failure was the result of booting him out of the club. The ground Nuff said already. Simply the best outside the Premiership. Possibly. Atmosphere With the home fans still settling in, the crowd can seem quiet and the stadium acoustics do not help. In my personal opinion the lack of nearby boozers does not help - we need a bit more alcohol-fuelled chanting. Local knowledge The stadium might be great, but stuck on industrial park near the motorway, it's not going to win any awards for aesthetic qualities. Indeed, the name of our fanzine, The Whiff, comes from the proximity of the nearby sewage works. The advice has to be: drink in town and get a bus/taxi to the ground. Oh, and don't eat the stadium \"food\", as cooking is an art that hasn't quite yet penetrated the nether reaches of the modern-day concrete bowl. Fanzines With Reading set in the heart of the UK's answer to Silicon Valley, the fanzine community is now almost entirely on the internet. Some of these are very good, especially Hob Nob Anyone?, Offateleven and 1871. The Whiff is now the only paper-based 'zine in existence at Reading, but testimony to the fact that people still want to hold a newspaper or similar in their hands rather than rush home and read it on the net. However, despite our resolutely Luddite approach, we also have a web site at www.thewhiff.com. http://www.royals.cx/ http://www.1871.cx/ http://reading.rivals.net/default.asp?sid=942",

The survey shows that while the principle of comprehensive education remains staunchly supported by 72% of all voters - rising to 80% of Labour voters - they are prepared to back the government's scheme for a new generation of \"specialist\" comprehensives. But the poll also shows that a significant minority - one in three of all voters - do not approve of the government's plan, which could see the development by 2006 of a two-tier system of \"bog standard\" schools, as the prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, described them, alongside the new schools specialising in subjects such as technology, the arts, media and sport. Twenty-nine per cent of Labour voters and nearly 40% of Liberal Democrat voters who support the principle of comprehensive education disapprove of the plan.

      "body": "<p><strong>THE THIRD WAY</strong></p> <p><strong>I was idly leafing through a reference book the other day and came across a reference to Third Lanark doing something (getting relegated, I think) in 1965. This surprised me as I had always taken that name to be rather like The Wanderers in England - a name in the early records, but long out of existence. What happened to them?</strong> asks Alan Cooper</p> <p>What happened to them indeed. As you suspected, Third Lanark were relegated at the end of the 1964-65 Scottish First Division campaign, losing a spectacular 30 of their 34 matches and ending up with seven points. Sadly, within two years, the club was declared bankrupt, thrown out of the league, and dissolved in the courts.</p> <p>Just how the club ended up like that was never properly ascertained - fans still claim boardroom corruption to this day - but the net result was plain enough, and the death knell sounded after a 2-2 draw away to Stranraer in 1967. Thirty-four years on, they're still the last Scottish club to go under - let's hope Airdrie don't join them.</p> <p>It was a sorry end to the scarlet-shirted Glasgow club, which had enjoyed no little success in the early years of Scottish football. The Third Lanarkshire Volunteers - also known as Third Lanark, Thirds, the Warriors, and the Hi-Hi - were founder members of the Scottish League, and won the championship in 1904 and the Scottish Cup in 1889 and 1905 (beating Celtic and Rangers respectively).</p> <p>Their odd nickname of the Hi-Hi can, we think, be attributed to the fact that their ground, Cathkin Park, enjoyed spectacular views of Glasgow, situated as it was on a rocky knoll in the southside of the city. The site of the ground is now a municipal park, and some of the terracing still exists. Frankly, it's a bit eerie.</p> <p><strong>LITTLE BROTHERS TRYING TO MAKE IT BIG</strong></p> <p><strong>At the moment in Italy, Christian Vieri's little brother Massimiliano and Roberto Baggio's little bro' Eddy are playing together for Serie B side Ancona. Are there any other younger brothers of big name players attempting to do likewise?</strong> asked Martin Casey.</p> <p>Don't worry Martin, there are plenty more brothers around. Joseph Vess points out that Youssouf Hadji (younger brother of Coventry's Mustapha) and Egutu Oliseh (same of Borussia Dortmund's Sunday) play for the French Second Division side AS Nancy Lorraine. </p> <p>Meanwhile, closer to home, Matthew Pike is convinced that Darren Huckerby's younger brother was last seen playing for Telford United. And Paul Gorman reckons that David Winters, the younger brother of Aberdeen forward (and occasional Scotland international) Robbie Winters is in the youth squad of Dundee United. \"Does this count?\" he asks. Well, why not?</p> <p><strong>DRAWS, DRAWS, DRAWS</strong></p> <p><strong>Is there any evidence that awarding three points for a win has made the game more exciting? Are there less draws than before the change? Would any English championships have been decided differently under the old system?</strong> asks Stuart McGill</p> <p>In 1980-1, the final year the English league used the old two-point system, there were 118 draws in the old First Division. The next year, with the new system introduced, there were 121.</p> <p>Perhaps they just needed to get used to it. What about the 1994-95 Premiership table, the last time the same number of matches were played? Er, 134 draws.</p> <p>Whether this is more exciting or not is entirely up to you.

      "bodyText": "THE THIRD WAY I was idly leafing through a reference book the other day and came across a reference to Third Lanark doing something (getting relegated, I think) in 1965. This surprised me as I had always taken that name to be rather like The Wanderers in England - a name in the early records, but long out of existence. What happened to them? asks Alan Cooper What happened to them indeed. As you suspected, Third Lanark were relegated at the end of the 1964-65 Scottish First Division campaign, losing a spectacular 30 of their 34 matches and ending up with seven points. Sadly, within two years, the club was declared bankrupt, thrown out of the league, and dissolved in the courts. Just how the club ended up like that was never properly ascertained - fans still claim boardroom corruption to this day - but the net result was plain enough, and the death knell sounded after a 2-2 draw away to Stranraer in 1967. Thirty-four years on, they're still the last Scottish club to go under - let's hope Airdrie don't join them. It was a sorry end to the scarlet-shirted Glasgow club, which had enjoyed no little success in the early years of Scottish football. The Third Lanarkshire Volunteers - also known as Third Lanark, Thirds, the Warriors, and the Hi-Hi - were founder members of the Scottish League, and won the championship in 1904 and the Scottish Cup in 1889 and 1905 (beating Celtic and Rangers respectively). Their odd nickname of the Hi-Hi can, we think, be attributed to the fact that their ground, Cathkin Park, enjoyed spectacular views of Glasgow, situated as it was on a rocky knoll in the southside of the city. The site of the ground is now a municipal park, and some of the terracing still exists. Frankly, it's a bit eerie. LITTLE BROTHERS TRYING TO MAKE IT BIG At the moment in Italy, Christian Vieri's little brother Massimiliano and Roberto Baggio's little bro' Eddy are playing together for Serie B side Ancona. Are there any other younger brothers of big name players attempting to do likewise? asked Martin Casey. Don't worry Martin, there are plenty more brothers around. Joseph Vess points out that Youssouf Hadji (younger brother of Coventry's Mustapha) and Egutu Oliseh (same of Borussia Dortmund's Sunday) play for the French Second Division side AS Nancy Lorraine. Meanwhile, closer to home, Matthew Pike is convinced that Darren Huckerby's younger brother was last seen playing for Telford United. And Paul Gorman reckons that David Winters, the younger brother of Aberdeen forward (and occasional Scotland international) Robbie Winters is in the youth squad of Dundee United. \"Does this count?\" he asks. Well, why not? DRAWS, DRAWS, DRAWS Is there any evidence that awarding three points for a win has made the game more exciting? Are there less draws than before the change? Would any English championships have been decided differently under the old system? asks Stuart McGill In 1980-1, the final year the English league used the old two-point system, there were 118 draws in the old First Division. The next year, with the new system introduced, there were 121. Perhaps they just needed to get used to it. What about the 1994-95 Premiership table, the last time the same number of matches were played? Er, 134 draws. Whether this is more exciting or not is entirely up to you. But changing the points system made no difference to the destination of any championships post 1982. However in the 1974-75 season three points for a win would have made a difference. That season Derby County came top with 53 points, ahead of Liverpool and Ipswich with 51. But as Neil Emms points out, Ipswich won 23 games, compared to 21 for Derby and 20 to Liverpool, and under the three points for a win system Bobby Robson's men would have won the title on goal difference, after finishing level on 74 points with Derby. WHY DO WATFORD HAVE A MOOSE ON THEIR BADGE? Why, if their nickname is The Hornets, do Watford have a moose on their club badge? asked Martyn Amos. \"The moose is actually a hart - a male deer - which represents the hart part of Hertfordshire,\" says Tim Beesley, from Berkhamsted, Herts. \"I've no idea why the spelling is different, lost in the mists of time no doubt,\" he continues. \"But I do know it is on the badge to represent the fact that for a very long time Watford were the only league club in Hertfordshire. Of course, this is no longer the case as Watford have been joined by Barnet. \"This is a relatively recent badge, as I think I'm right in saying the Watford badges of the 60's and 70's had a hornet on them,\" he adds. And the reason why Watford are called the Hornets? As Alan Brydon points out, that's because of their distinctive yellow and black kit. GOALS, GOALS, GOALS - BUT STILL RELEGATED Which (old) First Division team scored more goals than the other 21 but still ended up relegated? asks Eric Diver. You're talking about Manchester City - who else? - who were relegated in 1937-38, despite scoring 80 goals in 42 matches, three more than champions Arsenal. CAN YOU HELP? \"Bristol Rovers haven't yet won at home in the league this season. I know various teams have gone a whole season without winning away, but has a team ever gone a whole season without winning a home game?\" asks Andy Birbeck. \"France's Ligne magique of Thuram, Desailly, Blanc, Lizarazu, with Barthez in goal, have never been on the losing side as a unit, and has carted off the World Cup and European Championship to boot. Has there ever been a more successful international back line?\" asks Tom Paternoster. \"Is it true that veteran striker Roddy Grant (formerly of St Johnstone, Dunfermline Athletic, Partick Thistle, Cowdenbeath, Ayr United and currently with Brechin City) has scored against every team in the Scottish Premier, First, Second and Third Divisions?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's the end of the world as we know it. England, inventors of the game of football and a dominant force for much of the last century, have finally admitted total inadequacy and appointed a foreign coach to manage the national side. Sven-Goran Eriksson, the Swede whose predecessors included the badger and the turnip, will take over the poisoned chalice next June, providing Lazio don't lose patience with their departing coach before then.</p> <p>The furore this appointment has caused amongst the press and, in this case it appears, the public at large, says a great deal about the current national English psyche. Predictably, the Daily Mail has launched the offensive already, as if a Swedish football coach is somehow the straw breaking the camel's back of the British Empire, which now, finally, lies in ruins around our feet. This, of course, from the newspaper that paid Zola Budd to turn \"British\" in a vain attempt to win Britain some Olympic gold medals. </p> <p>Of rather more import is the reaction of Gordon Taylor, chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, who has effectively already informed the players he represents that Eriksson is the wrong man for the job. Some of these players will have to work with the man for the next few years and yet their union representative has already begun a campaign of vitriolic abuse against him. </p> <p>If various phone-in polls are to be believed, much of the English public are also against the very idea of a foreigner coaching the national side. Rather like the Daily Mail and Gordon Taylor, the rationale for this view seems to be nothing more than hurt national pride combined with an unhealthy dose of xenophobia. In other words, we're English, we invented the game, how can anyone be better at coaching it than we are? The stereotyping of the Swedes as a nation of skiers and hammer throwers is irrelevant; any foreign coach would have been subjected to the same kind of bile.</p> <p>Of course, there is a perfectly good football case for arguing that Eriksson should not get the job. With no experience of English football and little knowledge of the current England players beyond Beckham and a handful of others, how can he be better qualified than, say, Terry Venables? On the other hand, who else, apart from El Tel, is a qualified English option? Peter Taylor, with less than half a season of top flight experience? Bryan Robson, who's spent \u00a370m in taking Middlesborough into the bottom four?</p> <p>Although this lack of knowledge will be a hindrance in the short term, Eriksson's tactical appreciation and experience of the game outside of these shores will be a welcome change from Keegan's gung-ho naivety. Indeed, those crying out for a home grown coach may well be victims of that other great myth of English football: that our up-and-at-em, kick-and-chase style would be successful at international level, if only we had the guts to play it in its purest form. In other words, if we could only forget the fannying around possession game and give it to Johnny Foreigner where he doesn't like it, we'd be World and European Champions instead of the Frogs. Unfortunately it is lost on many that this argument can be rebutted in just two words: Graham Taylor. </p> <p>Indeed, it seems odd that, given our abysmal international record in the last three decades when we have had exclusively English managers with English back-up teams, that a change of approach is not more welcome. The stick-our-heads-in-the-sand method has got us precisely nowhere; why not try something different?</p> <p>Of course, some will say, the French success was all achieved with home grown coaching talent. Even ignoring the fact that they have something like 50,000 qualified coaches to our 2,000, this is not strictly true. The great French side of the early eighties (cheated out of the World Cup final in 1982 by the German goalkeeper and winners of the 1984 European Championship) was coached by Michel Hidalgo, a native Frenchman. Hidalgo, however, been an assistant in the set-up that forged this success when the French national side was coached by one Stefan Kovacs, a Romanian. </p> <p>Not only is the appointment of a non-national coach not unique to England, it is not even unique within English sport. There weren't too many calling for the removal of Steve Redgrave's coach, despite the fact that he has the very un-English name of Jurgen Grobbler. Likewise, was our cricket team's long-overdue victory over the West Indies this summer the less welcome because the coach, Duncan Fletcher, happens to be from Zimbabwe? </p> <p>Unfortunately, these arguments will cut little ice and almost no slack for Eriksson. Failure, even in his first game, will probably result in more vitriol than that heaped on Robson, Taylor and Hoddle combined. He is used to criticism of his tactics from the Italian media, who pride themselves on their knowledge of the game. What he won't be used to is the extraordinary level of personal abuse that will come his way, as well as that of his family and friends. </p> <p>The truly ridiculous part of this whole scenario is that most of those loudly proclaiming doom and disaster will be fully back behind the team as soon as it starts winning, whoever the coach happens to be. In other words, all Eriksson has to do to win back the hearts and minds of the public is to create a successful side. His problem is that he has precisely zero time in which to achieve it.</p> <p>Of course, there will be some that stick to their line no matter what. However, such died-in-the-wool nationalists are likely to be of a similar ilk to those who argued that England's 2 - 0 victory over Brazil in the mid-eighties was really only 1 - 0 as one of the goals was scored by the black John Barnes. Being black, they argued, he evidently couldn't be English and so could not have scored a goal for England. The fact that he also created the other obviously passed them by but then such people have never been noted for their appreciation of logic.</p> <p>In truth, though, the whole debate has been tainted by a nasty under-current of what might be termed racism. The major arguments given against Eriksson have had nothing to do with football and everything to do with his nationality, in other words, prejudice based on where he was born. It seems extraordinary that, in the year 2000, a multi-cultural society such as our own, should be having a public debate in such terms. If nothing else, it shows that much of our footballing sub-culture is still rooted in the nineteenth century.</p> <p>This is surely not how we want the rest of the world to perceive us. Whatever passport Eriksson happens to carry should not be a criterion for considering him for the job. As a nation, we ought to be grown up enough to accept two things: firstly, that the appointment of the national football coach is not a barometer of our success as a nation as a whole and secondly, that it should go the right man, wherever he happens to have been born.</p>",

The great French side of the early eighties (cheated out of the World Cup final in 1982 by the German goalkeeper and winners of the 1984 European Championship) was coached by Michel Hidalgo, a native Frenchman. Hidalgo, however, been an assistant in the set-up that forged this success when the French national side was coached by one Stefan Kovacs, a Romanian. Not only is the appointment of a non-national coach not unique to England, it is not even unique within English sport. There weren't too many calling for the removal of Steve Redgrave's coach, despite the fact that he has the very un-English name of Jurgen Grobbler. Likewise, was our cricket team's long-overdue victory over the West Indies this summer the less welcome because the coach, Duncan Fletcher, happens to be from Zimbabwe? Unfortunately, these arguments will cut little ice and almost no slack for Eriksson. Failure, even in his first game, will probably result in more vitriol than that heaped on Robson, Taylor and Hoddle combined. He is used to criticism of his tactics from the Italian media, who pride themselves on their knowledge of the game. What he won't be used to is the extraordinary level of personal abuse that will come his way, as well as that of his family and friends. The truly ridiculous part of this whole scenario is that most of those loudly proclaiming doom and disaster will be fully back behind the team as soon as it starts winning, whoever the coach happens to be. In other words, all Eriksson has to do to win back the hearts and minds of the public is to create a successful side. His problem is that he has precisely zero time in which to achieve it. Of course, there will be some that stick to their line no matter what. However, such died-in-the-wool nationalists are likely to be of a similar ilk to those who argued that England's 2 - 0 victory over Brazil in the mid-eighties was really only 1 - 0 as one of the goals was scored by the black John Barnes. Being black, they argued, he evidently couldn't be English and so could not have scored a goal for England. The fact that he also created the other obviously passed them by but then such people have never been noted for their appreciation of logic. In truth, though, the whole debate has been tainted by a nasty under-current of what might be termed racism. The major arguments given against Eriksson have had nothing to do with football and everything to do with his nationality, in other words, prejudice based on where he was born. It seems extraordinary that, in the year 2000, a multi-cultural society such as our own, should be having a public debate in such terms. If nothing else, it shows that much of our footballing sub-culture is still rooted in the nineteenth century. This is surely not how we want the rest of the world to perceive us. Whatever passport Eriksson happens to carry should not be a criterion for considering him for the job. As a nation, we ought to be grown up enough to accept two things: firstly, that the appointment of the national football coach is not a barometer of our success as a nation as a whole and secondly, that it should go the right man, wherever he happens to have been born.",

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw, the home secretary, will tomorrow announce new powers giving statutory force to the official campaign to tackle institutional racism in schools, hospitals, universities and across the whole public sector, including the police and prisons, the Guardian has learned. From April a positive legal duty to promote good race relations and equality of opportunity will be imposed on every public body, including ministries, Whitehall departments and local government. They will have to monitor the ethnic composition of their workforce to ensure it reflects the minority ethnic make-up of their local community. Public bodies will have a duty to assess the impact on racial equality of proposed policies and new services. For example, if an NHS trust proposes to close, or open, a hospital it would have to publish an assessment of what impact it would have on local minority ethnic communities. The announcement is being made by Mr Straw in a 60-page consultation paper as part of his attempt to maintain the momentum behind the government's anti-racist campaign. This weekend marks the second anniversary of the official inquiry report into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence. Mr Straw will tomorrow announce the latest progress report on the 70 recommendations by Sir William Macpherson. Attempts by the police to tackle institutional racism have already provoked a backlash from some officers who have received the backing of William Hague and some newspapers. The decision to extend the fight right across the public sector, backed by \"legal teeth\", is likely to intensify the debate. The statutory duty to combat institutional racism will mean public organisations will have to monitor the impact of existing policies on race equality. So far public debate on this has centred on such questions as the use by police of stop and search tactics, or practices inside the prison service. The way councils or housing associations allocate homes, or the way schools operate their exclusion policies towards troublesome pupils, will also come under scrutiny. The new duty will mean that an education authority or a university will have to publish an annual assessment which would not only detail the minority ethnic composition of teaching staff and others but specify levels of achievement by different ethnic groups and incidents of racial harassment. The measures will be legally enforceable by the commission for racial equality. Official inspection bodies such as Ofsted, HM inspector of police, the chief inspector of prisons, the audit commission and the national audit office will also beable to order compliance. The consultation paper will leave open the question of whether individual schools or the local education authority will be made the legally responsible body for tackling institutional racism.

      "bodyText": "The Premier League is to negotiate nine second-tier sponsorship deals as soon as the title sponsor, thought to be Sony, is announced. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore will meet the league's 20 club chairmen in London on Thursday to discuss the title sponsor, the buyer of the its overseas TV rights and its pay-per-view rights. The next stage of sponsorship negotiations will centre around the league's \"official partners\". Nine brands have been official partners this season. These are Sony PlayStation, Siemens, the Daily Telegraph, Nestle's Yorkie, McDonald's, npower, CIS, Procter &amp; Gamble's Wash &amp; Go and Glaxo SmithKline Beecham's Lucozade Sport. All the one-year agreements will expire at the end of this season. The sponsorships give each company a commercial relationship with the league's clubs. Each sponsor's budget is divided between the clubs - the individual club and sponsor decide how it is spent. The deals span areas such as advertising, product, equipment or knowledge supply. This year, Lucozade Sport provided nutritional and rehydration advice to the clubs. Siemens marketing manager Sue Rowe said her company was keen to renegotiate its deal for next season. But she said problems would arise if the league's title sponsor were a rival mobile phone manufacturer. Sony does make mobile phones. The electronics giant is believed to be the frontrunner to seal the title sponsorship deal. Budweiser, Pepsi and Coke have all stepped back from the sponsorship. Last week, the Premier League said two companies were left in the running. A deal with Sony would give the Premier League what it wants - a global company that is not an alcohol brand and that fits in with the league's global marketing strategy. Current title sponsor Carling is thought to have reentered talks with the Premier League. It had left the negotiating table claiming the league was dragging its feet. Carling's four-year deal cost it around \u00a327m a year. The new deal is thought to be worth at least \u00a345m annually.",

      "body": "<p>Riding the trains has never been much fun for South Africa's weary commuters. The first thing they have to contend with is whether or not the trains actually go.</p> <p>On Monday night they didn't, so enraged passengers burned down a good part of Pretoria's magnificent railway station. But there was a time when late arrivals were the least of commuters' problems.</p> <p>Rail passengers around the world, not least in Britain, complain of being treated as cattle. But in South Africa that was precisely the thinking behind the design of entire sections of the railway system.</p> <p>Trains were not there to carry passengers as such but workers herded each day from the sprawling black townships around Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town into the factories that thrived on cheap labour.</p> <p>Comfort was not a consideration. Time keeping was only an issue because late workers were bad for business. Service existed only to the extent of checking tickets and beating back people from the doors of overcrowded trains.</p> <p>The railways were famous under apartheid as a last refuge for white men unable to find jobs elsewhere. Black travellers suffered as a result.</p> <p>But it was in the early 1990s that travelling the trains around Johannesburg took on a new dimension - terror. The commuters packed into crowded carriages were easy targets for slaughter in the political killings that swept the Reef townships.</p> <p>Hundreds died on the trains. Men with automatic weapons and machetes marched on to the platforms of stations such as New Canada in Soweto and fired at random into the carriages or hacked at those who tried to run.</p> <p>There is one telling photograph taken from the front of a train. On the platform side, a group of armed men can be seen moving toward the doors. On the other side, commuters are pouring out of the windows and onto the track to escape the looming slaughter.</p> <p>A simple journey to work was to run the gauntlet of death. Some people travelled later, when the trains were emptier and less of a target. But most took their life into their hands to hang onto their jobs.</p> <p>Those days are past but while commuters are no longer afraid they are just as angry.</p> <p>Years of chronic under investment and poor service make the journey to work from outlying townships to jobs in the major cities a grind that can take almost as long as the hours spent at work on a bad day.</p> <p>Pent up frustration, and no one to direct it at, burst out on Monday evening after a signal failure forced the cancellation of trains from Pretoria station at rush hour.</p> <p>Several thousand people stormed the passenger services office. A handful lit fires. The flames quickly shot up to the roof and within minutes the 91 year-old historic station was engulfed.</p> <p>The near destruction of the classic building - its shell may yet be saved but some of its most outstanding features cannot be restored - only brought more grief for commuters as the government called the army out to keep order the next day for fear of another riot after the station was closed.</p> <p>There was no more trouble but there was a grim satisfaction among many travellers that at last they had hit back, even if it was at their own expense.</p> <p>Inevitably, train travel is not like that for everyone in South Africa. The country is also home to the world's most luxurious train - the Blue Train. It plies across the country and up to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe at a sedate 50 miles per hour.</p> <p>Delays are not common and the passengers would hardly care if they were. They travel in sound proofed cabins with private bathrooms and air conditioning. And they dress for dinner while the commuters on Pretoria station consider themselves lucky to get home in time for supper.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:chris.mcgreal@theguardian.com\">chris.mcgreal@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=chris+mcgreal&amp;Query=chris+mcgreal&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=Vdkpublicationdate+desc&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Chris McGreal</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4139299,00.html\">21.02.01: Commuters' revolt</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.news24.co.za/\" target=\"_new\">News 24, Johannesburg</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mg.co.za/\" target=\"_new\">Mail and Guardian, Johannesburg</a><br><a href=\"http://www.iec.org.za/\" target=\"_new\">South African independent electoral commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.gov.za/\" target=\"_new\">South African government</a><br><a href=\"http://www.dp.org.za/\" target=\"_new\">Democratic Alliance</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Riding the trains has never been much fun for South Africa's weary commuters. The first thing they have to contend with is whether or not the trains actually go. On Monday night they didn't, so enraged passengers burned down a good part of Pretoria's magnificent railway station. But there was a time when late arrivals were the least of commuters' problems. Rail passengers around the world, not least in Britain, complain of being treated as cattle. But in South Africa that was precisely the thinking behind the design of entire sections of the railway system. Trains were not there to carry passengers as such but workers herded each day from the sprawling black townships around Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town into the factories that thrived on cheap labour. Comfort was not a consideration. Time keeping was only an issue because late workers were bad for business. Service existed only to the extent of checking tickets and beating back people from the doors of overcrowded trains. The railways were famous under apartheid as a last refuge for white men unable to find jobs elsewhere. Black travellers suffered as a result. But it was in the early 1990s that travelling the trains around Johannesburg took on a new dimension - terror. The commuters packed into crowded carriages were easy targets for slaughter in the political killings that swept the Reef townships. Hundreds died on the trains. Men with automatic weapons and machetes marched on to the platforms of stations such as New Canada in Soweto and fired at random into the carriages or hacked at those who tried to run. There is one telling photograph taken from the front of a train. On the platform side, a group of armed men can be seen moving toward the doors. On the other side, commuters are pouring out of the windows and onto the track to escape the looming slaughter. A simple journey to work was to run the gauntlet of death. Some people travelled later, when the trains were emptier and less of a target. But most took their life into their hands to hang onto their jobs. Those days are past but while commuters are no longer afraid they are just as angry. Years of chronic under investment and poor service make the journey to work from outlying townships to jobs in the major cities a grind that can take almost as long as the hours spent at work on a bad day. Pent up frustration, and no one to direct it at, burst out on Monday evening after a signal failure forced the cancellation of trains from Pretoria station at rush hour. Several thousand people stormed the passenger services office. A handful lit fires. The flames quickly shot up to the roof and within minutes the 91 year-old historic station was engulfed. The near destruction of the classic building - its shell may yet be saved but some of its most outstanding features cannot be restored - only brought more grief for commuters as the government called the army out to keep order the next day for fear of another riot after the station was closed. There was no more trouble but there was a grim satisfaction among many travellers that at last they had hit back, even if it was at their own expense. Inevitably, train travel is not like that for everyone in South Africa. The country is also home to the world's most luxurious train - the Blue Train. It plies across the country and up to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe at a sedate 50 miles per hour. Delays are not common and the passengers would hardly care if they were. They travel in sound proofed cabins with private bathrooms and air conditioning. And they dress for dinner while the commuters on Pretoria station consider themselves lucky to get home in time for supper.

So if you took \u00a320 as a conservative average cost per child, multiplied it by, say, 5,000 (Wembley Arena holds 11,000), then that's \u00a3100,000 made just from the children in the audience, without even beginning to include the costs of their escorts.

Which added up to a mystery: where had all the money gone? </p> <p>Not, manifestly, on the show, which amounted to little more than the six Tweenie costumes plus dog costume, each containing an unknown actor, strutting and squeaking through a few song-and-dance routines. The mainstay of the production was a triptych of giant screens, whose crude inserts and graphics were presumably meant to compensate for the shortage of props, economy of cast and a catastrophic sound system that rendered even the most rudimentary dialogue unintelligible. </p> <p>In the absence of a narrative, the principal dramatic device was to remove the Tweenies from view, so that all the tinies began asking anxiously where they had gone, then, after a while, to make them come back. The greedy cynics who threw this shambles together seem to have decided, no doubt correctly, that adulation of the Tweenies is now so far advanced that the mere sight of the foursome in various permutations will satisfy their audience. So the sight of the foursome - albeit from a great distance - was what they offered. To be fair, the Tweenies did occasionally invite their audience to dance along with them: a form of participation which was not, alas, possible, for anyone except children sitting within nappy-throwing distance of the stage and would have been positively suicidal for many others sitting higher up. </p> <p>For most of the tots, glued to their parents' laps, or half trapped in the grip of an adult-size folding seat, the spectacle of the remote, squawking Tweenies going up and down through holes in an empty stage was considered excitement enough.

Those who like loud bangs were rewarded at the end of the show, when the Tweenies disappeared in the one prop that must have set them back more than a tenner: the Green Tweenie rocket, on which, of a morning, they soar into view. Pure, theatrical Calpol. </p> <p>The parents in my party conceded that the children had enjoyed it, in a notably muted kind of way. Then again, as one of the mothers said, \"They would like anything.\" The presentation of various bits of Tweenie junk probably added to the children's enjoyment. Among the adults in our row, the mood was less benign. It is not altogether comfortable to sit and watch tiny children having their trust and intelligence insulted. And anyway, we were bored. For all its enormous profits and its claims to be \"improving\", Tweenies Live! contrived to offer less than any other children's spectacle we could think of, from the local pantomime to the travelling circus, from the humblest puppet theatre to the elaborate stunts of Disney on Ice - even, someone muttered, to the acrobatics at the Dome.

As teenagers, as students, as young, single women, we flew all over the place without a second thought. </p> <p>So what happened? Why does motherhood make us all so anxious? And it's not only aeroplanes, but motorways, rashes, dog poo, strangers, deep water. It's partly rational, of course - suddenly there's so much to lose. Few would deny that the sheer, awesome responsibility of parenthood permanently alters you. But we're not just talking useful anxiety here, but something sneakier and jumpier and, I suspect, more hormonal. How many fathers do you know who go to pieces on jumbo jets? </p> <p>For me, it all reached a terrible crescendo after our third baby. Maybe it wasn't so surprising. I'd conceived, carried and given birth to three children in less than four years. If ever a person was drowning in hormones, I was. </p> <p>But once Raphael was a few months old, I developed blinding headaches - flashing lights, the lot. I became tense, self-absorbed. Even a walk to the swings with the double buggy seemed a feat. Few who knew me seemed to notice - people are endlessly forgiving to tired new mothers - but the GP sent me to see a neurologist who banged my knees with a hammer and shone lights in my eyes. Raphael watched, grave-faced and milky-lipped, from his carry-cot. \"Nice baby,\" the neurologist commented. </p> <p>\"But I can't see him,\" I said. \"When I get the headaches, he goes all blurred.\" </p> <p>Instead of telling me I had a brain tumour, the neurologist laughed. \"Poor chap. That won't do at all.\" </p> <p>I was amazed when he told me I was fine. \"But the headaches?\" </p> <p>He patted my arm. \"I think they'll go away now.\" </p> <p>\"I'm OK!\" I told my partner when I got home. </p> <p>\"Of course you are,\" he grunted, as he scraped dried Play-Doh from the kitchen table. And I was. </p> <p>Hypochondriac? I can see why you might think so. But it was only a year or so later, when I was my normal, bouncy self again, that I realised that I had been depressed. Anxiety can be a symptom of depression and I'd had it in spades. In fact, it was only when I got my sense of humour back that I saw how utterly loopy I had been. </p> <p>And though I suppose I'm glad I wasn't diagnosed, and (maybe) offered tranquillisers, I do wonder how many new mothers out there are unwittingly suffering. Motherhood makes you frantic, makes you edgy, makes you anxious - all of us to some extent and some more than others. I know that, you know that - so why do none of the books or experts tell us how to deal with it? </p> <p>These days, I'm not exactly laid back but - thanks to a strong, loving partner and a life-saving book called Manage Your Mind (Gillian Butler and Tony Hope, Oxford University Press, \u00a39.99), I do have the wild, panting hound that is my imagination on a firmer leash. Sometimes it still pulls where I don't want to go, but a sharp tug in the opposite direction is usually all I need to remain calm and sane. </p> <p>This morning in the playground, I pressed this invaluable tome on Jackie. She took it. \"But you know, I've been lying listening to all those planes taking off all morning,\" she said brightly. \"And not one has crashed.\" </p> <p>\"That's right,\" I agreed firmly. \"You'll be fine.\" </p> <p>And as we walked off across the asphalt with our gaggle of kids, we probably looked like we believed it. </p> <p>More or less.</p>",

If ever a person was drowning in hormones, I was. But once Raphael was a few months old, I developed blinding headaches - flashing lights, the lot. I became tense, self-absorbed. Even a walk to the swings with the double buggy seemed a feat. Few who knew me seemed to notice - people are endlessly forgiving to tired new mothers - but the GP sent me to see a neurologist who banged my knees with a hammer and shone lights in my eyes. Raphael watched, grave-faced and milky-lipped, from his carry-cot. \"Nice baby,\" the neurologist commented. \"But I can't see him,\" I said. \"When I get the headaches, he goes all blurred.\" Instead of telling me I had a brain tumour, the neurologist laughed. \"Poor chap. That won't do at all.\" I was amazed when he told me I was fine. \"But the headaches?\" He patted my arm. \"I think they'll go away now.\" \"I'm OK!\" I told my partner when I got home. \"Of course you are,\" he grunted, as he scraped dried Play-Doh from the kitchen table. And I was. Hypochondriac? I can see why you might think so. But it was only a year or so later, when I was my normal, bouncy self again, that I realised that I had been depressed. Anxiety can be a symptom of depression and I'd had it in spades. In fact, it was only when I got my sense of humour back that I saw how utterly loopy I had been. And though I suppose I'm glad I wasn't diagnosed, and (maybe) offered tranquillisers, I do wonder how many new mothers out there are unwittingly suffering. Motherhood makes you frantic, makes you edgy, makes you anxious - all of us to some extent and some more than others. I know that, you know that - so why do none of the books or experts tell us how to deal with it? These days, I'm not exactly laid back but - thanks to a strong, loving partner and a life-saving book called Manage Your Mind (Gillian Butler and Tony Hope, Oxford University Press, \u00a39.99), I do have the wild, panting hound that is my imagination on a firmer leash. Sometimes it still pulls where I don't want to go, but a sharp tug in the opposite direction is usually all I need to remain calm and sane. This morning in the playground, I pressed this invaluable tome on Jackie. She took it. \"But you know, I've been lying listening to all those planes taking off all morning,\" she said brightly. \"And not one has crashed.\" \"That's right,\" I agreed firmly. \"You'll be fine.\" And as we walked off across the asphalt with our gaggle of kids, we probably looked like we believed it. More or less.",

A world in which middle-class American - and, increasingly, British - parents treat their children as if they are competitors eternally racing for some undefined finishing line. A world in which the people-carrier becomes a second home as children are hustled from activity to activity in or der to make their future CVs as impressive as possible. A world in which raising the next Tiger Woods or Venus Williams has apparently become a more important goal than raising a happy, well-balanced child. </p> <p>\"It is the child-rearing issue of our time, at least for middle and upper-class families, across most of the western world,\" says US child psychiatrist Dr Alvin Rosenfeld, co-author of Hyper-Parenting: Are You Hurting Your Child by Trying Too Hard? </p> <p>\"Parents have been led to believe that they can somehow programme their children for success if only they do all the right things. It starts even before they are born, when pregnant women are warned of dire consequences if they don't eat the right foods.

Its real-life case studies, including a father who sought human growth hormone treatment for his 10-year-old son in the belief that short people are seen as losers, have shocked Americans. And his criticisms have been taken up by paediatricians and psychiatrists alarmed at the physical and mental toll that \"over-scheduling\" is taking on young lives. </p> <p>\"Doctors across the country are reporting a growing trend in children suffering from stomach ulcers and frequent headaches due to exhaustion and stress,\" says childhood expert William Doherty of the University of Minnesota. \"Teachers are dealing with exhausted kids in the classroom. It's a very serious problem.\" Doherty is helping dismayed parents in a handful of American suburbs to set up Family Lives First! groups, which request local sports and youth clubs to cut back on required games and classes. </p> <p>In the UK, too, GPs and child experts are reporting similar symptoms of stress among overtired and overstimulated middle-class children. With two working parents now the norm, many children are attending after-school clubs through necessity. But competitive pressures are also fuelling an explosion of private-sector extracurricular activities, including sports, language, music and maths classes for children as young as four. </p> <p>\"There is definitely a new parenting trend under way which says that you have to uncork all your child's potential at a young age, otherwise you will let them down,\" says Terri Apter, a Cambridge-based child and adolescent psychiatrist. \"It isn't entirely new: there have always been pushy parents.

She is currently studying a group of British and American 18-year-olds, many of whom are having enormous difficulty adjusting to the freedom of college life. \"A lot of them are so used to having their time filled up chock-a-block by their parents that, when they leave home, they are totally bewildered by these large swathes of unstructured time in their daily lives.

Or even - as has been suggested this week - the lacklustre current Social Democrat prime minister Milos Zeman.</p> <p>It was Klaus who helped Havel found the civic forum, the group of dissidents that led the Velvet Revolution that toppled the communists.</p> <p>Now, in a true illustration of how the country has split since 1989, the two men are public enemies - one a fervent advocate of capitalism, the other inclining toward more welfare-conscious politicking - prompting Klaus to say in a recent interview of his former friend: \"I don't believe what he says, what he stands for, what he does ... I am a normal person, he is not.\"</p> <p>What Mr Klaus probably finds hard to stomach is that only one Vaclav will lodge in the memory and it won't be him.</p> <p>Havel dismisses as \"tabloid speculation\" the idea that he might resign before his term of office is over, but he has strongly indicated that he will not rue the day when it comes.</p> <p>A few months ago he said he was looking to \"introduce a little slowness\" into his life, and wished to drive through the streets of Prague without the regulation blue flashing light on his official car.</p> <p>\"I might neglect a great number of my presidential obligations,\" he said, \"but I will have time to think and look into other cars and watch people.\"</p> <p>They sounded just like the words of a man who in 13 years has never felt comfortable with the trappings of power and may no longer have the energy to drive his scooter down the corridors of Prague Castle, but has plenty of mental vigour - and a wealth of material - to return to writing absurdist plays.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto: kate.connolly@theguardian.com \"> kate.connolly@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28kate+connolly%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=kate+connolly&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Kate Connolly</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.czech.cz/ \" target=\"_NEW\">The Czech Republic</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.centraleurope.com/czechtoday/\" target=\"_new\">Czech Today </a><br> <a href=\" http://www.praguepost.cz/ \" target=\"_new\">The Prague Post Online</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.pbj.cz/ \" target=\"_new\">Prague Business Journal</a> <a href=\"http://www.idnes.cz/\" target=\"_NEW\">Mlada fronta DNES</a></p>",

And with this latest illness they have come of age, say commentators, after finally beginning to confront the taboo topic of life after Havel, the man who has like no other Czech politician, shaped his country's post-communist image and been key to securing places at the negotiating tables of both the EU and Nato (which the Czech Republic joined two years ago). It will be hard to find a replacement for a man who, despite his flagging popularity at home, is on the world stage one of the most popular politicians, credited with helping to overthrow communism in eastern Europe, who has been described as a better Czech export than even Skoda cars or beer. But asked recently by the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes whether Vaclav Havel should consider stepping down due to his health, 66 per cent of pollsters responded in favour of him doing so. Jiri Leschtina writing in the same paper, said if he resigns now, Havel would be betraying himself. But others say if he doesn't, Havel - around which there is a growing air of irreplaceability - is in danger of allowing the post to fall to some highly controversial figures. Now, say an increasing number, would be the time to pass the baton to the sturdy yet uncharismatic former dissident, Petr Pithardt, leader of the senate, thus blocking the attempts of the opposition Civic Democratic Party (ODS) to place its ruthlessly pro-capitalist leader and former prime minister, Vaclav Klaus, in the post. Or even - as has been suggested this week - the lacklustre current Social Democrat prime minister Milos Zeman. It was Klaus who helped Havel found the civic forum, the group of dissidents that led the Velvet Revolution that toppled the communists. Now, in a true illustration of how the country has split since 1989, the two men are public enemies - one a fervent advocate of capitalism, the other inclining toward more welfare-conscious politicking - prompting Klaus to say in a recent interview of his former friend: \"I don't believe what he says, what he stands for, what he does ... I am a normal person, he is not.\" What Mr Klaus probably finds hard to stomach is that only one Vaclav will lodge in the memory and it won't be him. Havel dismisses as \"tabloid speculation\" the idea that he might resign before his term of office is over, but he has strongly indicated that he will not rue the day when it comes. A few months ago he said he was looking to \"introduce a little slowness\" into his life, and wished to drive through the streets of Prague without the regulation blue flashing light on his official car. \"I might neglect a great number of my presidential obligations,\" he said, \"but I will have time to think and look into other cars and watch people.\" They sounded just like the words of a man who in 13 years has never felt comfortable with the trappings of power and may no longer have the energy to drive his scooter down the corridors of Prague Castle, but has plenty of mental vigour - and a wealth of material - to return to writing absurdist plays.

      "body": "<p>Never mind things, did the planet's prospects improve under Tony Blair? Measured against indices of global warming and environmental degradation, Labour barely twitched the dial. But assessed against other countries' efforts and taking into account the public's lust for burning fuel and turning on lights, Labour might win a prize in the every-little-helps stakes.</p> <p>Gordon Brown grasped the nettle of taxing industry to cut energy consumption though he also fulfilled the manifesto promise to cut VAT on domestic fuel to 5%, hardly likely to encourage homeowners to use less. Motorists were pillaged through the fuel price escalator - until they rebelled last year.</p> <p>All the talk about sustainability - John Prescott did produce a \"sustainable development strategy\" in 1999 but little has been heard of it since - cannot mask a fundamental point. When it came to the rural and urban white papers, jobs and prosperity were Labour's foremost concerns. If they could be accommodated on brown rather than green fields, well and good. But in the language of priorities, growth trumped environment every time.</p> <p>As Labour strove to reconcile business interests with the welfare of the planet, a series of uncomfortable compromises were made. The bid to cut carbon emissions (20% by 2010 was the promise) was never going to involve a serious effort to substitute non-fossil fuels in producing energy. Tiny support was offered wind farms and solar cells - Tony Blair's promise to finance research on renewables turned out to be based on \u00a350m not even from the government but the national lottery's new opportunities fund. Still, the chart shows what will happen if Labour's package of measures to cut greenhouses gases are put into effect, cutting total output of such gases by 23% by 2010, carbon dioxide by 19%.</p> <p>Those reductions depend on Labour's greatest environmental achievement, the climate change levy starting in April, despite the Confederation of British Industry's protests. The trouble was, the green message was never consistently delivered. If domestic fuel was made cheaper, VAT was cut on insulation and poorer households were helped to lag roofs and seal windows. In contradiction, restrictions were lifted on gas-fired power stations and Labour tried to help what is left of the UK's deep-mined coal industry, old sentiment tugging against new green imperatives. On the sustainability side of the ledger a new tax on aggregates - gravel for building - is payable from next year and landfill taxes were raised.</p> <p>Fuel duty escalator was invented by the Tories to fill the Treasury's coffers and Labour used it to pump up revenues it could not get because it had promised not to raise income tax. Between May 1997 and the end of last year the pump price of unleaded rose by 42% of which 22 percentage points were due to tax. Had it been linked from the start with improved public transport motorists might just have been persuaded (the aggregate real costs of motoring having fallen over the long term). But the 10-year plan for transport launched last year, even before the September protests, showed Labour's reluctance to attack the car culture. After all, Longbridge is the epicentre of Midlands electoral marginalism. No congestion charges, so far. Bike lanes have largely been left to a charity, Sustrans, to build.</p> <p>Some greenery had sprouted round the edges of transport policy, excise duty cut to encourage cleaner engines and less powerful cars, car tax allowances linked to carbon output. But road building also expanded.</p> <p>When countryside dwellers invade London on March 18, it will be worth asking whether things really did get worse for them. Labour, true to its postwar traditions, proved as much the farmers' sugar daddy as the Tories.

      "bodyText": "Never mind things, did the planet's prospects improve under Tony Blair? Measured against indices of global warming and environmental degradation, Labour barely twitched the dial. But assessed against other countries' efforts and taking into account the public's lust for burning fuel and turning on lights, Labour might win a prize in the every-little-helps stakes. Gordon Brown grasped the nettle of taxing industry to cut energy consumption though he also fulfilled the manifesto promise to cut VAT on domestic fuel to 5%, hardly likely to encourage homeowners to use less. Motorists were pillaged through the fuel price escalator - until they rebelled last year. All the talk about sustainability - John Prescott did produce a \"sustainable development strategy\" in 1999 but little has been heard of it since - cannot mask a fundamental point. When it came to the rural and urban white papers, jobs and prosperity were Labour's foremost concerns. If they could be accommodated on brown rather than green fields, well and good. But in the language of priorities, growth trumped environment every time. As Labour strove to reconcile business interests with the welfare of the planet, a series of uncomfortable compromises were made. The bid to cut carbon emissions (20% by 2010 was the promise) was never going to involve a serious effort to substitute non-fossil fuels in producing energy. Tiny support was offered wind farms and solar cells - Tony Blair's promise to finance research on renewables turned out to be based on \u00a350m not even from the government but the national lottery's new opportunities fund. Still, the chart shows what will happen if Labour's package of measures to cut greenhouses gases are put into effect, cutting total output of such gases by 23% by 2010, carbon dioxide by 19%. Those reductions depend on Labour's greatest environmental achievement, the climate change levy starting in April, despite the Confederation of British Industry's protests. The trouble was, the green message was never consistently delivered. If domestic fuel was made cheaper, VAT was cut on insulation and poorer households were helped to lag roofs and seal windows. In contradiction, restrictions were lifted on gas-fired power stations and Labour tried to help what is left of the UK's deep-mined coal industry, old sentiment tugging against new green imperatives. On the sustainability side of the ledger a new tax on aggregates - gravel for building - is payable from next year and landfill taxes were raised. Fuel duty escalator was invented by the Tories to fill the Treasury's coffers and Labour used it to pump up revenues it could not get because it had promised not to raise income tax. Between May 1997 and the end of last year the pump price of unleaded rose by 42% of which 22 percentage points were due to tax. Had it been linked from the start with improved public transport motorists might just have been persuaded (the aggregate real costs of motoring having fallen over the long term). But the 10-year plan for transport launched last year, even before the September protests, showed Labour's reluctance to attack the car culture. After all, Longbridge is the epicentre of Midlands electoral marginalism. No congestion charges, so far. Bike lanes have largely been left to a charity, Sustrans, to build. Some greenery had sprouted round the edges of transport policy, excise duty cut to encourage cleaner engines and less powerful cars, car tax allowances linked to carbon output. But road building also expanded. When countryside dwellers invade London on March 18, it will be worth asking whether things really did get worse for them. Labour, true to its postwar traditions, proved as much the farmers' sugar daddy as the Tories. Agricultural interests were excused the harsh competitiveness prescribed by the prime minister and chancellor for other industries. No effort equivalent to what is now happening in Germany was made to rebase agricultural production on sustainable, animal-friendly principles. No heads rolled as a result of the BSE inquiries. Frightened by the marches in 1997, the government rushed to throw in ad hoc hush money for rural transport and housing and safeguards for village shops. Having prevaricated on hunting until recently, Labour made more progress on a statutory right to roam. The Countryside Act will open up 4m acres, though \"local forums\" in which landowners are unlikely to be reticent will be set up to discuss access. Labour did establish new national parks with strong planning regimes covering the New Forest and parts of the South Downs and \"countryside\" was itself extended as 30,000 hectares were newly classified as green belt. But this has been a growth government and growth means extra pressure on green fields and extra emissions of greenhouse gases, especially from transport.

      "bodyText": "BBC staff will begin working to rule in protest at a new expenses policy from next Monday, in a move that will hit location drama shoots and outside broadcast sports coverage. The work to rule follows a ballot by broadcasting union Bectu of more than 6,000 BBC staff members last week. In the vote, 85% opted in favour of a work to rule, which will commence on Monday February 26. In a potentially disruptive move made to drive the union's point home, BBC staff will return to their office for lunch if they are working on location less than five miles away. This is a protest against staff being told they cannot claim more than \u00a36 for lunches away. In London, this could involve journeys of two hours or more if staff have to cross central London to get from a location shoot back to TV centre in White City. In a protest against the ban on the use of private cars, staff will also only use BBC cabs, rather than their own cars, for late-night and early-morning shifts. In addition, Bectu has recommended members only use hotels booked by the BBC. Under the new rules, staff can only stay at hotels that cost up to \u00a355 a night. A Bectu spokesman said the work to rule would continue \"indefinitely\". \"As the days get longer, the impact will become greater, hitting longer sporting events and drama shoots,\" the spokesman added.

Speaking after a meeting with the prime minister, Tony Blair, Mr Trimble added: \"If there is failure to deal with these issues then obviously we have to take stock and a review is an obvious way of taking stock.\"</p> <p>Mr Trimble spent an hour in talks with Mr Blair but declined to say whether the meeting had left him more optimistic about the possibility of a breakthrough. Mr Blair also met today with nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party member Seamus Mallon, who urged the prime minister to call a round table meeting of all pro-agreement parties in a bid to end deadlocked discussions.</p> <p>Mr Trimble said: \"I very much hope there is a progress as a result of these meetings but we are as yet uncertain.\" He appealed to republican leaders to show the \"moral courage\" displayed by unionists.</p> <p>Mr Trimble added: \"It is time for people to shoulder their obligations and I think that is true of republicans as well as nationalists.\"</p> <p>Mr Mallon told the prime minister that with talks on decommissioning, policing and demilitarisation still deadlocked, there was about a week left to get an agreement.</p> <p>The meeting came as Sinn Fein considered legal action to stop chief constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan from starting a recruitment campaign for the new policing service. In Belfast, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness warned that without the establishment of a policing board, the decision to go ahead would be illegal.</p> <p>Ahead of the today's meeting at Number 10, the Democratic Unionist party leader, the Reverend Ian Paisley, claimed the Northern Ireland peace process was now \"shattered\". Mr Paisley, a staunch critic of the Good Friday agreement, said Mr Trimble's recent warnings that the peace process could be heading for a review have dealt the process a critical blow. He said: \"It has been shattered by what Mr Trimble has said - that they now need to devise new workable democratic structures for the agreement.\"</p> <p>However, the Northern Ireland minister, John Reid, insisted he had been encouraged by the constructive tone of today's discussions.</p> <p>\"I think the positive nature of this morning's meetings means we will be able to carry through the process,\" he said.</p> <p>He said all the suggestions put forward would be discussed with the Irish government on his trip to Dublin.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,440706,00.html\">21.2.2001: Orange Order urged to negotiate</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,440357,00.html\">20.2.2001: Mandelson gives \u00a310,000 to campaign to bring action over Omagh bombing</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,439661,00.html\">18.2.2001: 'We'll quit' say RUC chiefs</a><br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.htm\" target=\"_new\">The Good Friday agreement</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.uup.org/\" target=\"_new\">Ulster unionist party</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.sdlp.ie/Default.htm\" target=\"_new\">SDLP</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.dup.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Democratic unionist party</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street</a><br></p>",

Mr Trimble warned that republicans needed to make \"hard decisions\" to break the deadlock over policing, demilitarisation and IRA disarmament. Speaking after a meeting with the prime minister, Tony Blair, Mr Trimble added: \"If there is failure to deal with these issues then obviously we have to take stock and a review is an obvious way of taking stock.\" Mr Trimble spent an hour in talks with Mr Blair but declined to say whether the meeting had left him more optimistic about the possibility of a breakthrough. Mr Blair also met today with nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party member Seamus Mallon, who urged the prime minister to call a round table meeting of all pro-agreement parties in a bid to end deadlocked discussions. Mr Trimble said: \"I very much hope there is a progress as a result of these meetings but we are as yet uncertain.\" He appealed to republican leaders to show the \"moral courage\" displayed by unionists. Mr Trimble added: \"It is time for people to shoulder their obligations and I think that is true of republicans as well as nationalists.\" Mr Mallon told the prime minister that with talks on decommissioning, policing and demilitarisation still deadlocked, there was about a week left to get an agreement. The meeting came as Sinn Fein considered legal action to stop chief constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan from starting a recruitment campaign for the new policing service. In Belfast, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness warned that without the establishment of a policing board, the decision to go ahead would be illegal. Ahead of the today's meeting at Number 10, the Democratic Unionist party leader, the Reverend Ian Paisley, claimed the Northern Ireland peace process was now \"shattered\". Mr Paisley, a staunch critic of the Good Friday agreement, said Mr Trimble's recent warnings that the peace process could be heading for a review have dealt the process a critical blow. He said: \"It has been shattered by what Mr Trimble has said - that they now need to devise new workable democratic structures for the agreement.\" However, the Northern Ireland minister, John Reid, insisted he had been encouraged by the constructive tone of today's discussions. \"I think the positive nature of this morning's meetings means we will be able to carry through the process,\" he said. He said all the suggestions put forward would be discussed with the Irish government on his trip to Dublin.

Eidos has been hit hard by delays in delivering the much-hyped PS2. Game buyers have held back from buying new software until the latest console is available. This resulted in a series of profit warnings and top-level management resignations in the second half of last year. The PS2 consoles will begin to arrive in Europe over the next few months. But Mr Protheroe said the advent of third-generation mobile phones could provide an important revenue stream for Eidos. \"Today, our core business remains PlayStation 2 consoles and PCs, and that will be the case for the next couple of years. \"But mobile phones will become an increasingly important market,\" he said.

This, it is assumed, is his last.\"</p> <p>The piece goes on to suggest that the prime minister's political career is well and truly over: \"Barak made two incredible blunders after the election.</p> <p>\"First he announced impetuously that he was quitting and then he withdrew that decision. This coming on top of the unprecedented beating at the polls and the fact that, previously, his one-man rule in Labor had alienated nearly every higher-up in the party left him with no allies. No one in Labor wanted him and some feared he wouldn't even give up the party leadership.\"</p> <p>The Tel Aviv daily, <a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a>, looks ahead to a new - and in all likelihood bitter - contest for the heart and mind of the sorely divided Israeli Labour party: \"[Barak's] letter to Sharon paves the way for a leadership struggle inside Labor.

      "bodyText": "Ehud Barak's abrupt throwing in of the political towel happened too late to allow this morning's papers anything but the most cursory coverage. An instant analysis by Sarah Honig in the Jerusalem Post starts crisply: \"When we all thought that Ehud Barak had zigged all the zags possible, he zigged yet another late last night. This, it is assumed, is his last.\" The piece goes on to suggest that the prime minister's political career is well and truly over: \"Barak made two incredible blunders after the election. \"First he announced impetuously that he was quitting and then he withdrew that decision. This coming on top of the unprecedented beating at the polls and the fact that, previously, his one-man rule in Labor had alienated nearly every higher-up in the party left him with no allies. No one in Labor wanted him and some feared he wouldn't even give up the party leadership.\" The Tel Aviv daily, Ha'aretz, looks ahead to a new - and in all likelihood bitter - contest for the heart and mind of the sorely divided Israeli Labour party: \"[Barak's] letter to Sharon paves the way for a leadership struggle inside Labor. The first items on the party agenda is for the central committee on Monday to determine not only which of its members will serve in the presumed national unity government, but who will fill Barak's place as chairman of the party.\" Ha'aretz also has an eyecatchingly angry commentary targeting Israelis who always cast themselves as the victims. Writer Amira Hass finds a fine irony in predictions, from within the security establishment, that the Palestinian National Authority is on the point of collapse, and suggests that if that is so, it may have something to do with Israel's continued occupation tactics, and its own view of itself. \"Those who yield to the victim mindset that is daily fed by Israeli occupation mechanisms; those who count their own dead and wounded while remaining indifferent to the huge number of dead and wounded on the other side, are making no attempt to understand the meaning of the experiment that began in the last decade of the 20th century. \"The Oslo lab experiment [the peace process] must be judged, not on the basis of the promises and declarations of its architects, but on the basis of the Israeli policy implemented on the ground.

      "bodyText": "The Daily Mail has dismissed the Express's attempts to drive readers away by suggesting owner Richard Desmond simply isn't up to playing with the big boys. The circulation director for the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday claims the Express lacks the resources to retaliate in the next round of the promotions war. Mike Newman, who manages promotions and circulation for the two papers, said he doubted the Express had the \"people on the ground\" to put its new promotional drive into practice. Mr Newman spoke to MediaGuardian.co.uk following reports the Express plans to offer Express readers \u00a310 for converting their subscriptions to the Daily Mail. \"One of the reasons Associated Newspapers can offer these schemes is that we have lots of people out there who can visit shops. \"I frankly doubt whether Express Newspapers has the people on the ground to put this scheme into place,\" he says. And he confirmed Associated would be offering newsagents \u00a35 for each Express to Mail conversion. He noted the Express had just made a number of cuts to its circulation department. He also rebuffed suggestions the two newspaper groups were \"at war\", saying the tactics were just \"standard news trade practice\". \"I can think of at least four occasions in the past four years when we've done this,\" he said. He said Associated had identified \"a way of rolling out circulation by capturing readers from the Express - it is in a weak position because it has a new owner\". Last week the Express circulation director Nigel Lomas defected to News International. This morning the Express published a searing piece identifying the Rothermere family - the proprietors of Associated Newspapers - as \"dysfunctional\". The Express is trying to establish itself as the paper for family values in place of the Daily Mail. Relevant story February 21: Express blasts Harmsworths",

      "body": "<p>The bones of dead Aids victims have been ground to powder and mixed with heroin by Chechen drug dealers to spread the virus through Russia and debilitate the nation, Sasha, a young HIV-sufferer in St Petersburg, insisted. </p> <p>This is the reason for the dramatic explosion of HIV infections in the city, he said, and very possibly how he contracted the disease. Either that or by using a needle borrowed from a friend. 'Most of them are already infected. I know about 40 people who've tested positive in the last few months. There's no way of escaping it now,' he said. </p> <p>Waiting for check-up results in a cold corner of the city's main HIV hospital, he made an effort to look cheerful. 'As soon as I've got over my heroin addiction, I'm going to go back to college and get a job in the timber industry where I can work in the fresh air,' he said. </p> <p>His doctor assessed his prospects with less optimism. 'In a few years, when he contracts Aids, neither he nor the government will be able to afford the necessary drugs and he will die,' she said. </p> <p>The seeds of a catastrophe are germinating in St Petersburg, largely ignored by local and central government. Over the past two years, Russia has been experiencing the world's swiftest rate of growth in HIV cases, with the crisis intensifying more rapidly than in any African country. Russia's northern capital is in the grip of a severe epidemic - progressing faster than in any other city throughout the federation. Two years ago there were no more than around 200 cases of HIV registered in St Petersburg, but last January local doctors became concerned by a sudden surge in infections. A year later, some 7,000 people are infected with about 1,200 new cases emerging every month. </p> <p>The government has been slow to tackle the problem. As a result, among the group most at risk - people between the ages of 17 and 23 - understanding of the illness remains primitive. There is uncertainty about how the disease can be transmitted and the pulverised bone theory is widely believed. </p> <p>Specialists know how the situation will progress. Over the next year the disease will be passed from drug users, prostitutes and the gay community and begin to spread through the rest of the community, pushing the number up further. 'It's only then that the local authorities will start paying attention. But of course by then it will be too late,' commented Vladimir Musatov, a doctor with M\u00e9d\u00e9cins du Monde, one of the independent organisations trying to combat the outbreak. </p> <p>Late into the night, six days a week, he sits on a bus travelling between the main prostitute highways and the high-rise suburbs where drug use is most intensive. The bus has clean needles, facilities for testing and photocopied information on the transmission of the disease. Even when the temperature outside drops to minus 22 degrees, people queue in the snow to talk to the doctors in the bus. </p> <p>Sveta, 24, broke off from her five-hour shift by the roadside, for which she earns about 400 roubles (\u00a39.75), to pick up new needles. 'I'm very frightened about the disease,' she said, looking old and tired beneath her cheerful make-up. 'A few years ago we hardly knew what Aids was, and now we all know someone who's infected.' </p> <p>St Petersburg has a heroin problem. About four years ago, it stopped being just a transit point on the drug route between Central Asia and West Europe and became an important market in its own right. Large quantities of very cheap heroin appeared, costing around 70 roubles (\u00a31.70) a hit, and drug consumption soared tenfold among the young population. </p> <p>About 98 per cent of those infected by HIV are intravenous drug users. But the 70 people who turn up every night at the bus are but a fraction of the 100,000 intravenous drug users in the city. 'The government needs to implement a series of campaigns, targeting prostitutes, drug users, schoolchildren and the general public on the risks,' Musatov said. 'Do I expect them to do this? No.' </p> <p>Ingrained distaste for drug addiction among the Soviet generation has allowed many officials to suggest that those infected have only themselves to blame. 'We need to see real political desire to combat the epidemic, but the government is much better at hiding problems than at resolving them,' Alexander Tskhanovitch, director of the M\u00e9d\u00e9cins du Monde programme, said. </p> <p>The head of the government-run centre for the fight against Aids, Vadim Pokrovsky, said: 'Many officials still don't believe we have an Aids problem.' This belief is fed by the much-quoted statistic that there are currently only 125 people in Russia suffering from the disease, with only 780 deaths registered. </p> <p>Across the country some 86,000 people have been registered with HIV, which officials believe to be only 20 per cent of the real figure. Pokrovsky believes that by the end of the year, the actual number of HIV-infected Russians will rise to about a million, increasing to four million by 2005. Set against Russia's shrinking population of 145 million, the figure is disturbing. </p> <p>Pokrovsky wants the government to set up a single anti-Aids co-ordinating body, headed by members of Russia's powerful Security Council, to oversee the battle against the disease. He too is doubtful about the likelihood of this happening. 'Last year the government gave us less than $2 million (\u00a31.4m) to buy medicines, to pay for information campaigns and for testing, and this year the same amount has been allocated. To work effectively, we need no less than $100 million,' he said. </p> <p>Doctors at Russia's only HIV maternity ward, on the edge of St Petersburg, treat pregnant HIV mothers to reduce the risk of passing the disease on to their unborn babies. In a clean ward upstairs, abandoned HIV-positive babies lie in neat rows of cots. Until 1997 only 20 babies had been born in Russia with the infection; since then 1,147 more have arrived - most of them the children of drug-using mothers. The future for these babies is not bright. </p> <p>With the most effective Western drug treatment priced at around $800 (\u00a3544) a month per patient - and no Russian equivalent on the horizon - the doctors know that they will be unable to treat the children when they become ill.</p>",

She is going to the TB clinic. They will sort out the TB but then they will send her home to die. She is fatally weakened and there are no antiretroviral drugs to take on HIV here. </p> <p>Nokuthula, 23, is also under a death sentence, for all that she appears robust with health. So is her 18-month-old son Sipho, whose name means a gift. The young mother has put herself and her child in the care of the traditional healer in the township outside Natalspruit hospital who gives them herb and bark infusions to make them strong. But traditional medicine could not save Nokuthula's husband, who died of Aids last September. </p> <p>At an age when women in the west are embarking on families and careers, Refilwe and Nokuthula have begun the business of dying. They live in the East Rand suburbs of Johannesburg, South Africa, where one in five is estimated to be harbouring the virus that will kill them. </p> <p>Across Africa and the developing world millions more will die of diseases that are treatable in the west, such as diarrhoea, meningitis, malaria, TB and Aids. The hospitals do what they can, but their best efforts are a sticking plaster on a haemorrhage. The western drugs they need are unaffordable. Life is priced too high. </p> <p>Thirty-five miles away in Pretoria, a legal battle critical to the fate of many more women like Refilwe and Nokuthula, their men and their children, is about to begin. Case number 4183/98 in the South African high court is an action brought by 42 pharmaceutical companies, including the British giant GlaxoSmithKline, against the South African government. </p> <p>The case is an attempt to block South Africa from importing cheap medicines. The drug companies have spent three years and millions of pounds preparing the case. </p> <p>They have retained virtually every patent lawyer in South Africa. On March 5 their barristers will try to stop the South African government from buying the medicines its people so badly need from countries where the prices are lowest, on the grounds that it is infringing world trade agreements. </p> <p>The rest of Africa will be closely watching the outcome of the trial. So will developing countries on other continents. With the death toll from infectious diseases inexorably rising, especially in Africa, a tide of outrage is swelling among local activists and international aid organisations who see medicines denied to the sick in the name of commerce. </p> <p>More than 2.5m people die every year from Aids-related illnesses. More than 13m children have lost one or both parents to the condition. There are more than 32m men, women and children infected by HIV in developing countries. AZT and 3TC, the basic antiretroviral drugs in the west, would keep them alive and well, but the price tag is $10,000 (\u00a37,000) to $15,000 per patient a year. The majority of employed people in South Africa, with whole families to support, earn less than $3,000 a year, and by comparison with most of the rest of the continent, they are rich. </p> <p>But there are now alternatives - cheap copies of life-saving medicines called generics, made mainly in Brazil, India and Thailand whose national laws allow them to ignore drug patents in cases of dire human need. Thailand believes it could reduce the cost to $200 a year per patient. It is a price the South African government might be able to pay for the life of Refilwe and Nokuthula, but the drug companies, in Case 4183/98, afraid of the potential worldwide consequences if their prices start to be undercut, say no. </p> <p>Today in Cape Town at least 5,000 supporters of the successful grassroots Treatment Action Campaign will march on parliament to demand the medicines. At the same time in London, Oxfam is launching an international campaign demanding help for developing countries who want to use legitimate measures to buy or make their own cheap drugs, but who are bullied into submission by the lawyers working for drug companies and by the western governments who support them. </p> <p>The pharmaceutical companies argue that they need 20 years of patent protection to recoup the vast sum it costs to research and develop drugs. They say it takes $1bn and at least 12 years to get a new medicine to market. </p> <p>But, their accusers say, 90% of those new medicines are designed for 10% of the world's population in rich countries who can pay for them. The companies argue they already sell to developing countries at prices lower than in the west and that, with the approval of UNAids, the joint UN programme on HIV/Aids, five major companies have offered 85% discounts on drugs that are badly needed. </p> <p>That could bring antiretrovirals down to $1,500 a patient, low enough for poor countries to hand them out to a chosen few but, say critics, millions would still have to die. </p> <p>The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of South Africa, which is bringing the case with the international companies, says it supports any country's right to buy supplies of drugs that are cheaper abroad \"in exceptional circumstances\". But it argues that section 15c of the Medicines Act, passed by the South African government in 1997 to allow it to import cheap copies of western medicines, would give the health minister \"unfettered discretion to override patent rights for medicines in this country\". And it was appalled when the South African delegation told a World Health Organisation meeting in January 1999 that the new legislation was a model which the rest of Africa should follow. </p> <p>It is not just Africa that worries the big pharmaceuticals. On behalf of the industry the US government is taking the offensive to Brazil, which has had dramatic success in manufacturing its own cheap copies of patented drugs and now exports generics. Its price for an AZT equivalent is down from $15,000 a year to $4,000. There are now 60,000 people with HIV in Brazil who get free treatment. </p> <p>At the heart of the growing legal battles directed against South Africa, Brazil and several other developing countries lies a little known international agreement called Trips - trade related intellectual property rights. It was agreed within the World Trade Organisation in order to ensure patent rights were respected around the world. The poorest countries have until 2006 to comply with Trips by passing their own patent laws. Under Trips, signatory states can pass clauses, as South Africa has tried to do, to bypass patents and make or buy cheaper drugs in cases of \"dire emergency\", and few could argue Aids is less than that. </p> <p>But the west's sharp legal minds, backed by vast drug company wealth, are willing and able to mount expensive challenges in the courts to uphold their patent rights - and thus the price of their drugs - as is about to happen in Pretoria. </p> <p>For the first time, there is also about to be a challenge in the WTO itself. Last month the new US administration, which accepted substantial election funding from the pharmaceutical industry, asked for a WTO disputes hearing where it will claim Brazil is in breach of Trips. Oxfam and others fear the offensive against Brazil and South Africa marks a new determination by the drugs companies to resist the flouting of their patents by poor countries. </p> <p>GlaxoSmithKline has recently threatened legal action against the Indian generics company Cipla, blocking its plans to bring a cheap version of Combivir - AZT and 3TC in one pill - into Uganda and Ghana. \"The implementation of WTO patent rules is taking place against the backdrop of a sustained campaign led by the pharmaceutical industry which may well erode the public health protection provided by safeguard provisions,\" says an Oxfam report published today. </p> <p>In Khayelitsha, a shanty town that sprawls over a vast plain near Cape Town's airport, the Nobel prize-winning volunteer doctors are raising the stakes. They pioneered the use of nevirapine, a drug that stops pregnant women transmitting HIV to their babies. Now the government is rolling out the programme to the entire country. </p> <p>After the period of apostasy, when President Thabo Mbeki upset the medical world by doubting that HIV caused Aids, the government seems willing to seek out and use cheap drugs if it is allowed to. </p> <p>Last year it opened an infectious diseases clinic - code for HIV - where people are offered counselling and treatment for the \"opportunistic infections\" that can kill. They use fluconazole, a strong antibiotic most hospitals lack because of its price, to treat cryptococcal meningitis and thrush. </p> <p>In May, they will take the most radical step of all and start 150 adults and 30 children who are at death's door on antiretrovirals - the very medication that keeps people in the west with HIV alive. Dr Eric Goemaere, head of the South African mission of Med\u00e9cins sans Fronti\u00e8res, sees it as a marker for the future. \"We are here on the frontline to show that it is possible and it will change attitudes totally,\" he says. </p> <p>South Africa could by now be in the relatively advantageous position of Brazil, he believes, making its own cheap drugs and importing others. Perhaps Nokuthula's husband need not have died and Refilwe might be strong. There was a political willingness to use generics in 1997, but Case 4183/98 put a stop to all that. \"I have no hesitation in saying that I'm totally convinced that's exactly where it is,\" Dr Goemaere said. \"The pharmaceutical companies blocked South Africa becoming like Brazil.\" </p> <p>South Africa's director general of health, Ayunda Ntsaluba, says something similar. \"Three years down the road, access to medicines would have been completely different. We would be providing certainly for opportunistic infections, although it would be disingenuous to say we would have been providing triple therapy,\" he said. </p> <p>It is hard to be a doctor in Africa. Herman Reuter, a young South African of German extraction who works for MSF in Khayelitsha, has more medicines at his disposal than most, but he is clearly under strain. Doctors go into the profession to cure the sick, not temporarily staunch their wounds before they die. </p> <p>\"We have our worse days and our better days,\" he says. \"I saw one woman last Friday with a CD4 count of two [very low resistance to infection]. I said we hope to give antiretrovirals by May. She said, 'yes, but doctor, what happens until May?' I see many people die.\" </p> <p>A very sick woman of about 41 had been brought to his clinic that morning by her 18-year-old daughter. She had cryptococcal meningitis. A week earlier, she had been to a government hospital and was turned away. There was nothing they could do for her, they said. They did not have the right medicine. But they mentioned the MSF clinic. </p> <p>Dr Reuter was able to give her fluconazole, which costs around $4 for a 200mg capsule that will, for the moment, save her life. His last resort is to send the very sick to Somerset hospital in Cape Town, where pharmaceutical companies are running trials of drug combinations for HIV. </p> <p>There is a bitter irony in it. The trials cannot be run in Britain or the US where the drugs will eventually be sold because everyone who needs antiretrovirals is on them. Refilwe and Nokuthula have no hope of a trial. Their best chance is to eat well, if they can afford to, to build up their strength and hang on. </p> <p>Refilwe, like the rest of the patients in wards 13 and 16, refuses to accept she has HIV. What is the point when there is no treatment? \"I don't know why I'm sick,\" she says, barely audibly. </p> <p>Nokuthula places all her hope in the traditional healer, David Ngalana, even though he acknowledges he can give her only limited help. A large poster on the wall declares: \"Traditional medicine can cure almost all sicknesses but currently we cannot cure HIV/Aids.\" </p> <p>Nokuthula knows nothing about Aids drugs. There are no antiretrovirals for the people of her township, so they may as well not exist. She will drink her treebark infusions and convince herself they failed to save her husband only because he did not take them properly. In that way, maybe, hope can triumph for a while over despair. </p> <p>\u0095 Tomorrow: Dying for Drugs - how the drug giants flex their global muscle.

She sits as straight as a knife, all bone, white robe, and huge eyes gazing at nothing, breathing shallowly through an open mouth. She is 30 and has a son of seven. She has tuberculosis and her mouth is covered with the telltale white spots of a common infection she cannot fight off, because HIV is destroying her body's resistance. Ask her how she is and she slowly turns her entire body towards you. \"I'm feeling better,\" she whispers. It is a fiction maintained by the plump and jolly nurses at the Natalspruit hospital outside Johannesburg who have dozens more like her on drips in wards 13 and 16, where anybody with any strength resists going because if you have HIV, you have no future. Refilwe, impossibly, gets to her feet and makes her way with pitiful steps and the arm of a nurse to the door, a walking wraith. She is going to the TB clinic. They will sort out the TB but then they will send her home to die. She is fatally weakened and there are no antiretroviral drugs to take on HIV here. Nokuthula, 23, is also under a death sentence, for all that she appears robust with health. So is her 18-month-old son Sipho, whose name means a gift. The young mother has put herself and her child in the care of the traditional healer in the township outside Natalspruit hospital who gives them herb and bark infusions to make them strong.

      "body": "<p>Austrian minnows Sturm Graz were surprise qualifiers for the second stage of the Champions League. They could yet be surprise qualifiers for the quarter-finals too.</p> <p>After losing their first two Group A games to Manchester United and Valencia, Sturm have now beaten Panathinaikos twice in a week. They followed up last week's 2-0 home victory by winning the return in Athens 2-1.</p> <p>First-half goals from Markus Schopp and Mario Haas put Graz into a commanding position, and Ioannis Goumas's 73rd-minute header for the home side was too little, too late. </p> <p>Sturm Graz coach Ivica Osim was in ebullient mood after the game, claiming: \"Everyone thought Sturm would be easy opponents. That has not happened - and it will not happen in the next game.\" </p> <p>But he admitted that next game - against Valencia in Graz on March 7 - wouldn't be easy. \"Miracles don't happen every day,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>Gala suffer pain in Spain</strong></p> <p>Galatasaray suffered their first defeat in Group B, going down 2-0 away at Deportivo La Coruna. </p> <p>Deportivo went into the game on the back of two successive Group B defeats, and despite enjoying most of the early possession looked nervous in front of goal. But those nerves were settled on 40 minutes when Victor fired home after Djalminha's shot was deflected to him at the far post. </p> <p>Galatasaray were reduced to ten men on 58 minutes when Vedat Inceefe was sent off for a tackle from behind on Victor that brought him his second yellow card. Fifteen minutes later, Djalminha made the game safe for La Coruna with a well-taken penalty.</p> <p>\"The referee was very strict with the sending-off of Vedat but just after he didn't follow the same criterion with Mauro Silva [of Deportivo],\" claimed Galatasaray coach Mircea Lucescu after the game. \"The penalty was non-existent. The crowd refereed the game. Deportivo played at a high level, though,\" he added. </p> <p>\"The group is very even now,\" Lucescu continued. \"Whoever qualifies will go through in the last minute of the last game.\" </p> <p>Deportivo coach Javier Irureta said he expected his side to make it through to the last eight, providing they beat PSG in their next game. \"Winning the next game at home to PSG should be enough,\" he said. \"We were the better side tonight. We took the initiative, although we lacked a bit of composure on the key chances.\"</p> <p><strong>Late goal earns Milan a draw</strong></p> <p>A last-minute goal from substitute Jose Mari gave AC Milan a 1-1 draw at Paris St-Germain. </p> <p>PSG took the lead with a 25-yard free-kick from Laurent Robert after 75 minutes, but Jose Mari scrambled an injury-time equaliser through a mishit a shot that dribbled over the line as the wrong-footed PSG keeper Lionel Letizi scrambled after the ball. </p> <p>The result means that Galatasaray lead the group with seven points, followed by AC Milan and Deportivo Coruna on six and PSG on two. </p> <p>However, PSG coach Luis Fernandez has refused to concede the club's Champions League campaign is over. \"It's not all over yet,\" Fernandez said. \"We've got two matches left and we've got to win them both. It's as simple as that.\"</p> <p>But the maths are against him: PSG need to win their last two matches and hope Milan do the same to go through.</p> <p>Leonardo, who was playing against his former club, admitted his side's goal was \"a bit lucky\". </p> <p>\"Even though we are unbeaten in this phase it won't be easy for us in the last two games,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Austrian minnows Sturm Graz were surprise qualifiers for the second stage of the Champions League. They could yet be surprise qualifiers for the quarter-finals too. After losing their first two Group A games to Manchester United and Valencia, Sturm have now beaten Panathinaikos twice in a week. They followed up last week's 2-0 home victory by winning the return in Athens 2-1. First-half goals from Markus Schopp and Mario Haas put Graz into a commanding position, and Ioannis Goumas's 73rd-minute header for the home side was too little, too late. Sturm Graz coach Ivica Osim was in ebullient mood after the game, claiming: \"Everyone thought Sturm would be easy opponents. That has not happened - and it will not happen in the next game.\" But he admitted that next game - against Valencia in Graz on March 7 - wouldn't be easy. \"Miracles don't happen every day,\" he said. Gala suffer pain in Spain Galatasaray suffered their first defeat in Group B, going down 2-0 away at Deportivo La Coruna. Deportivo went into the game on the back of two successive Group B defeats, and despite enjoying most of the early possession looked nervous in front of goal. But those nerves were settled on 40 minutes when Victor fired home after Djalminha's shot was deflected to him at the far post. Galatasaray were reduced to ten men on 58 minutes when Vedat Inceefe was sent off for a tackle from behind on Victor that brought him his second yellow card. Fifteen minutes later, Djalminha made the game safe for La Coruna with a well-taken penalty. \"The referee was very strict with the sending-off of Vedat but just after he didn't follow the same criterion with Mauro Silva [of Deportivo],\" claimed Galatasaray coach Mircea Lucescu after the game. \"The penalty was non-existent. The crowd refereed the game. Deportivo played at a high level, though,\" he added. \"The group is very even now,\" Lucescu continued. \"Whoever qualifies will go through in the last minute of the last game.\" Deportivo coach Javier Irureta said he expected his side to make it through to the last eight, providing they beat PSG in their next game. \"Winning the next game at home to PSG should be enough,\" he said. \"We were the better side tonight. We took the initiative, although we lacked a bit of composure on the key chances.\" Late goal earns Milan a draw A last-minute goal from substitute Jose Mari gave AC Milan a 1-1 draw at Paris St-Germain. PSG took the lead with a 25-yard free-kick from Laurent Robert after 75 minutes, but Jose Mari scrambled an injury-time equaliser through a mishit a shot that dribbled over the line as the wrong-footed PSG keeper Lionel Letizi scrambled after the ball. The result means that Galatasaray lead the group with seven points, followed by AC Milan and Deportivo Coruna on six and PSG on two. However, PSG coach Luis Fernandez has refused to concede the club's Champions League campaign is over. \"It's not all over yet,\" Fernandez said. \"We've got two matches left and we've got to win them both. It's as simple as that.\" But the maths are against him: PSG need to win their last two matches and hope Milan do the same to go through. Leonardo, who was playing against his former club, admitted his side's goal was \"a bit lucky\". \"Even though we are unbeaten in this phase it won't be easy for us in the last two games,\" he said.",

Parallel trials have already begun on 18 volunteers in Britain to see if the vaccine has any toxic effects. </p> <p>The vaccine stems from the discovery that 60 prostitutes in Nairobi's Majengo slum - around 5 per cent of the total - were immune to HIV despite massive exposure to it. The women had between five and 10 sexual partners every day, and rarely used condoms. Up to 25 per cent of Kenyans are estimated to be HIV positive, and in Nairobi's slums even more. </p> <p>'They didn't have the virus or the antibodies. So they must have been getting rid of the virus so quickly that it couldn't get established,' said Dr Job Bwayo, leader of the Kenyan team, yesterday. </p> <p>Nairobi scientists discovered the women's immune systems were utilising an aggressive cell against the virus. The instant other cells became infected these 'killer T-cells' destroyed them. </p> <p>'We took the HIV virus and white blood cells from the prostitutes, put them in a test-tube and - bang! - they reacted. The cells killed the virus,' said Bwayo. </p> <p>The discovery spawned similar studies around the world. A team from Oxford's Institute of Molecular Medicine found the same phenomenon in prostitutes in the Gambia. In 1995 the Oxford and Nairobi teams joined forces. Backed by the New York-based International Aids Vaccine Initiative, their efforts have so far cost $4.5 million - a comparative snip. </p> <p>The idea of a vaccine is to train the body's immune system to recognise characteristics of an enemy virus in advance, so that it will tell foe from friend when the attack comes. Traditionally, that has meant injecting people with a weakened or killed version of the virus itself, triggering antibodies. </p> <p>Around 25 experimental Aids vaccines based on this principle are on trial globally. All except one have failed to get past the preliminary test stage. The new vaccine aims to trigger a different kind of immuno-response, producing not antibodies but cells - killer T-cells. Results in animals have been encouraging. Around 30 per cent of monkeys injected with the vaccine proved immune to extremely high doses of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV's close cousin. </p> <p>Professor Andrew Mc-Michael, leader of the Oxford team, said yesterday: 'I believe we have a really good chance of this thing working; somewhere in the region of 70 per cent.' </p> <p>McMichael confirmed that the trialists in Britain, himself included, had suffered no side-effects. 'We didn't expect any and we're very happy,' he said. </p> <p>If the Kenyan trials go as well , the vaccine will be tried on a large, high-risk population in 18 months. Kenya will be the perfect testing ground because the vaccine is designed for subtype A of the virus, the predominant strain in East Africa. All existing vaccines target subtype B, predominating in Europe, Asia and America. 'As a vaccine for people in the UK this would not be optimal, though we believe we could adapt it quite easily,' said McMichael. </p> <p>The best case scenario would see manufacturers called in after two years of population trials, and the vaccine widely available in another two years: around six years from now. Bwayo said: 'This vaccine may not prove to be the one. But we have hopes that, if not, one of the modifications currently being produced in Oxford will be.' </p> <p>Three months ago, such co-operation briefly seemed a distant dream. Reports that McMichael and a colleague, Dr Thomas Hanke, had patented the vaccine without mention of their Kenya colleagues caused a storm in the region's media.

The court heard that he bought gay porn magazines and videos on trips to London and Oxford and hid them from his wife in the attic. When police raided the house after his arrest in August they found 33 gay videos, hundreds of magazine cuttings and 3,000 gay images of teenage boys downloaded on to his computer. Prosecutor Greg Bull described Gray as a \"Jekyll and Hyde\" character who appeared to be a respectable citizen. \"But he had deeper, darker motives for seeking out young boys,\" he said. The court heard that the boy told of the meeting when, three months later, his parents questioned him about his internet phone bill. In evidence, the boy, who had been given the computer with a dedicated phone line to help with his homework, said he was \"confused\" because he thought he might be gay. \"I confided in my friends but not my parents. I was trying to speak to people of my own age who would understand me. I gave [Gray] my telephone number.\" After the hearing, the boy's mother said: \"I would warn other parents to watch what their children are doing on the computer.\" The case comes after seven men were jailed for their part in the Wonderland internet paedophile ring. Michele Elliott, director of Kidscape, said recent cases showed the urgent need for restrictions on the internet.",

Last night it awarded McQueen the British Designer of the Year award at the Rover British Fashion Awards.</p> <p>McQueen, who will leave his post at the House of Givenchy to concentrate on his own label, collected his award at the star-packed ceremony in Battersea Park. The Prince of Wales, Sir David Hare, Jodie Kidd and Joely Richardson were among the audience who watched McQueen beat off fellow designers Clements Ribeiro and Julien Macdonald.</p> <p>McQueen's own show last season featured a padded cell as a stage set, with the models pounding desperately at the partitions separating them from the unnerved audience. Among the more elegant and commercial clothes were dresses made from feathers and mussel shells, with skull caps pulling their faces back into seemingly agonising contortions.</p> <p>The show played with the accusations of madness frequently levelled at him by his detractors, accusations equalled by the compliments paid to his \"genius\" by fans.</p> <p>McQueen, 31, recently sold a 51% stake in his company to the Gucci Group. This sale is said to be behind his future departure from Givenchy, which is owned by the rival fashion conglomerate, LVMH. McQueen's show on Thursday is the most anticipated event in London Fashion Week this season.</p> <p>Despite the prestige of the award, it was never going to be a wholly celebratory affair. Hussein Chalayan, winner of the award for the past two years, went into liquidation last month - his accolade unable to keep him solvent.</p> <p>The rest of the awards went to names and faces familiar to those inside and out of the fashion world.</p> <p>The New Generation Designer Award, intended to recognise emerging talent, was presented by soap star-turned-pop star Natalie Imbruglia to Stella McCartney, designer for the French fashion house, Chloe. McCartney has become one of the most popular designers for Europe and America's younger fashion followers. Last year she was winner of the Glamour award. This year, that award went to Welsh designer Julien Macdonald, whose revealing sparkling dresses have, in the past two years, become a staple for starlets. Paul Smith beat John Smedley and Joseph for Classic Design award.</p> <p>Last year's winner of Classic Design, Burberry, was awarded Contemporary Collections this time round, emphasising its unlikely renaissance in recent seasons from being deemed staid and traditional to becoming the favourite checked pattern of every trendy young thing.</p> <p>Actor Johnny Lee Miller presented Kate Moss with the British model of the year award. Other awards went to Jemima Khan (Rover People's Award), bag designer Anya Hindmarch (accessory designer) and the street style designer award went to i.e. uniform, while Richard James was named menswear designer of the year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alexander McQueen may be the self-styled bad boy of British fashion, but the industry can't seem to get enough of him. Last night it awarded McQueen the British Designer of the Year award at the Rover British Fashion Awards. McQueen, who will leave his post at the House of Givenchy to concentrate on his own label, collected his award at the star-packed ceremony in Battersea Park. The Prince of Wales, Sir David Hare, Jodie Kidd and Joely Richardson were among the audience who watched McQueen beat off fellow designers Clements Ribeiro and Julien Macdonald. McQueen's own show last season featured a padded cell as a stage set, with the models pounding desperately at the partitions separating them from the unnerved audience. Among the more elegant and commercial clothes were dresses made from feathers and mussel shells, with skull caps pulling their faces back into seemingly agonising contortions. The show played with the accusations of madness frequently levelled at him by his detractors, accusations equalled by the compliments paid to his \"genius\" by fans. McQueen, 31, recently sold a 51% stake in his company to the Gucci Group. This sale is said to be behind his future departure from Givenchy, which is owned by the rival fashion conglomerate, LVMH. McQueen's show on Thursday is the most anticipated event in London Fashion Week this season. Despite the prestige of the award, it was never going to be a wholly celebratory affair. Hussein Chalayan, winner of the award for the past two years, went into liquidation last month - his accolade unable to keep him solvent. The rest of the awards went to names and faces familiar to those inside and out of the fashion world. The New Generation Designer Award, intended to recognise emerging talent, was presented by soap star-turned-pop star Natalie Imbruglia to Stella McCartney, designer for the French fashion house, Chloe. McCartney has become one of the most popular designers for Europe and America's younger fashion followers. Last year she was winner of the Glamour award. This year, that award went to Welsh designer Julien Macdonald, whose revealing sparkling dresses have, in the past two years, become a staple for starlets. Paul Smith beat John Smedley and Joseph for Classic Design award. Last year's winner of Classic Design, Burberry, was awarded Contemporary Collections this time round, emphasising its unlikely renaissance in recent seasons from being deemed staid and traditional to becoming the favourite checked pattern of every trendy young thing. Actor Johnny Lee Miller presented Kate Moss with the British model of the year award. Other awards went to Jemima Khan (Rover People's Award), bag designer Anya Hindmarch (accessory designer) and the street style designer award went to i.e. uniform, while Richard James was named menswear designer of the year.",

      "body": "<p>Her dresses have featured on more front pages than Alexander McQueen's or Stella McCartney's, although hers is hardly a household name. For the past two seasons, the British designer Maria Grachvogel has stolen the show at London Fashion Week. A year ago, Victoria Beckham caused a paparazzi frenzy when she appeared on the catwalk wearing Maria Grachvogel. Last autumn, it was Jodie Kidd in a \u00a31m dress dripping with diamonds, also designed by Maria Grachvogel. On Friday, she will unveil her latest collection at this year's fashion week. So, should we hold the front page? </p> <p>\"They weren't gimmicks,\" sighs Grachvogel. There are just a few days to go until showtime, and the designer, who hasn't taken a day off since Christmas, is standing in her airy West End studio in a toile (a mock up of an outfit) trying out sleeve shapes. Indeed, she is an easy target for criticism - at last year's British fashion awards, Hussein Chalayan railed against the invasion of celebrities on to the catwalk. Much of the criticism stems from the fact that in London, an astute young designer who knows how to manipulate the media to gain exposure is regarded with suspicion. British fashion designers are supposed to grow pale and thin in as-yet-undiscovered parts of east London, spending every last penny on Cambodian rubber buttons and vintage kimono fabric; not, as Grachvogel has done, win awards for running a successful small business. </p> <p>Grachvogel must have known that the Beckham catwalk stunt would garner publicity. \"Of course I did. But, honestly, neither of us had any idea how much coverage there would be. The day after she did my show we talked on the phone and we were both, 'ohmigod, it's everywhere!' I mean, it was on the front page of the Bombay Times.\" </p> <p>The picture made the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, as well as newspapers in France, Germany and Singapore. </p> <p>When the next fashion show rolled around, Grachvogel knew she \"couldn't get another celebrity to model. That would just have been awful. But I had this great idea of dewdrops on a spiderweb, and I thought, if the dewdrops could be diamonds . . . so I asked Van Peterson.\" The diamond dress, which had its own team of security guards made the finale to her show and caused another media flurry. </p> <p>With so many British fashion designers struggling to keep afloat, it would be churlish to turn noses up at such astute commercial sense. Grachvogel is well aware of the pitfalls. \"It is very hard to make a fashion business work. The cost of doing a collection now - just of getting the samples made - is around \u00a330,000. Then you've got the show itself which can cost anything from \u00a330,000 to \u00a350,000. And you've got to do that twice a year. You've got to sell a hell of a lot of clothes to make money.\" </p> <p> None the less, conscious that \"the last two shows were taken as a gimmick\", Grachvogel is keen to \"do something different, put all my energies into the clothes\". This season, the starring role on the Grachvogel catwalk will go to a sub-col lection of around 10 couture gowns - \"one-off, over the top, fantastical, glamorous.\" How much will they cost? \"Expensive. These are money-no-object gowns\". </p> <p>The inspiration for the couture collection stems from her current personal project: designing and making the dress for her own wedding in May. But don't expect demure white frocks. The feather-strewn studio - \"it looks a bit like an abbatoir in here\" - is the aftermath of days spent making feather corsets, and there will be \"amazing devor\u00e9 and appliqu\u00e9, all done by hand; gold lace appliqu\u00e9d on to stretch velvet, and glossy garnet sequins on soft satin chiffon. Really glamorous gowns.\" </p> <p>Glamorous gowns are what Grachvogel has always done best, but her own office wear is business-like - black polo neck with trousers and ankle boots, not a thigh slit or sequin in sight. An engagement ring is her only jewellery. But she combines a deeply sensible and practical nature with a romantic, fairytale imagination: not many 31-year-old women refer to dresses as \"gowns\", after all. </p> <p>Grachvogel was \"making stuff for people, if they paid me\" by her early teens. At around 14, she got \"really into how things were made. My needlework teacher told me that if you cut something on the bias you don't need darts. I hated making darts, so I started bias cutting.\" She worked on herself and her friends, taking measurements and making pattern blocks. \"I still use the same basic shape. All designers have their own blocks, and they are the building blocks of your fit. My dresses are a very different fit from anyone else's. There are bias cut dresses, and there are bias cut dresses.\" </p> <p>The daughter of a Polish father, who was an accountant, and an Irish mother, who was a housewife, Grachvogel grew up in the suburbs of north London \"spending all my time on buses coming up to town\". At 16, she knew she wanted to be a fashion designer. \"Everyone said, you need to go to St Martins [Central St Martins College of Art and Design, London]. But you can't go there until you're 18 and that seemed like ages away. So I thought, I'm going to set up my own business.\" </p> <p>Half embarrassed, half proud of her precociousness, Grachvogel recalls being interviewed after applying to take a stand at the prestigious London Fashion Week designers' exhibition. \"I turned up for an interview, with my clothes in a suitcase. The woman must have thought I was completely bonkers but she was really nice. She would say: 'This is lovely, how much is it?' And I was just making up prices. She would ask me: 'What's going to happen when you take an order from a buyer, how will you produce it?' And I was just making it up as I went along. At the end she said: 'My advice to you is to go away and learn about running a fashion business.' So I did.\" </p> <p>After college, Grachvogel needed to find some money with which to start her business. \"I went into the City because it was well paid.\" At 17, she took a London stock exchange exam, and became the youngest person ever to pass it. \"Which seemed funny, since all I wanted to be was a fashion designer.\" Grachvogel's first business, a collaboration with a friend and fellow designer, didn't work out. She wound up back in the City. \"I needed money and needed to get out of that situation.\" Six months later, she was designing again. </p> <p>It is 10 years since Grachvogel set up her own company, in January 1991. \"The first collection was just nine dresses. I kept to eveningwear and glamour because people I had been making clothes for privately had said to me that they wanted something special, so I knew that even if I didn't do any wholesale I had clients who would order these dresses.\" For the first five years, growth was slow. \"Glamour was just not big then, and grunge wasn't me and I knew it. You have to stay true to the essence of your style.\" In the latter half of the 90s, the style zeitgeist began slowly but surely to swing towards glamour and gowns. Grachvogel's time had come. </p> <p>The collection that will be shown on Friday has been gruelling to produce. \"I've reached a point of delirium now, working 15 hours every day for so long,\" she says. \"I haven't worked this hard in years. But then, this is the most excited I've been about a collection in a long time. Because it's all about the clothes.\"</p>",

Cabinet office minister Ian McCartney has said a review will begin \"as soon as possible\" and will be completed early next year. A steering group will be set up to conduct the review in cooperation with the cabinet office and COI bosses. \"The standard options are continued agency status, privatisation, abolition, merger, contracting out and market testing,\" said Mr McCartney. \"Each option will be considered on its merits and the preferred option will be the one that offers best value for money.\" The last major review of the COI was conducted in 1996/7, when the Conservative government raised the issue of privatisation. However, the Labour government halted plans to privatise semi-independent government bodies when it came into power. The review will once again raise the question of whether the government needs its own communications body. There have been suggestions in the past that it would be more cost effective to employ a private sector company to carry out the work. Separately, COI Communications has confirmed plans to put more than \u00a3100m worth of advertising business up for grabs in a review expected to kick off once a general election date has been announced. The timing means the review would take place during a lull in government advertising. The government is not allowed to advertise between the time it calls an election and polling day. The review will affect many of London's biggest advertising agencies.

Bosses at the TV stations have taken the decision not to screen live uncut 24-hour footage of the housemates via the website, ComicRelief.com. The live 24-hour coverage was what made Big Brother such a phenomenon last year. Millions of office workers addicted to the show abandoned work and logged on. But in the new version, internet viewers will be restricted to selected archived footage, which will probably amount to anodyne footage of celebrities eating dinner, washing up and amiably chatting. The decision was taken in order to appease the 10 celebrities, who will be locked in the house for one week in March. Insiders say the celebrities would never have agreed to appear on the show if there was live coverage, because it could have damaged their public image. \"They certainly wouldn't have gone on if there were cameras in the loos or cameras catching every detail of their behaviour, like the show did last year when Mel was caught plucking her pubic hair in the garden,\" said one source. So far there are no confirmed celebrities for the show but those tipped include Mel B, Anthea Turner, Ruby Wax, Frank Skinner and Richard Blackwood. Meanwhile, work has now started on the website for Big Brother 2 following the reappointment of Victoria Real to develop and maintain the site.

He has also hit out at a perceived arrogance at the highest level of the BBC saying the board of governors must wake up to the changing world and stop treating the BBC as a special case. The head of Oftel said the BBC should be \"more susceptible to the government in the future\" and should have paid closer attention to last year's communications white paper. \"The need to ensure consistency and the need to treat people on a far more equitable basis would have been better demonstrated had the government proposed the BBC be more susceptible to the government in the future,\" Mr Edmonds said at last night's Royal Television Society dinner. Senior figures within the broadcasting industry will be buoyed by the senior regulator's hints that the BBC should be brought under the wing of the Ofcom watchdog unveiled in the white paper. The BBC was not threatened with independent regulation in the white paper. However, Mr Edmonds warned the corporation it must stop treating itself as a unique and special case in the UK media. \"My own view is that the BBC is missing an opportunity. \"If I were a governor I would have been asking myself how I could use this paper to create a solid base for the future rather than saying 'this does not apply to me',\" he said. Mr Edmonds went on to urge the broadcast industry to embrace the Ofcom watchdog. This body will combine Oftel, the Independent Television Commission and other regulators including the Broadcasting Standards Commission and the Radio Authority. \"My hope is the broadcast industry puts to one side some of the anxieties it may have and shares in the development and evolution of the organisation,\" he added.",

      "body": "<p>Film producer-director Mervyn LeRoy once famously commented: \"If I wanted to send a message, I'd use Western Union.\" Although he hated the expression \"message picture\", Stanley Kramer, who has died aged 87, spent most of his career countering critics who attacked him for his wishy-washy liberal sentiments, and for tackling huge themes with inadequate artistic means.</p> <p>Andrew Sarris wrote: \"If Kramer were not so vulnerable in his sincerity, he would not have made such a tempting target. He will never be a natural, but time has proved that he is not a fake.\" Pauline Kael felt that Kramer's films were \"melodramas with redeeming social importance, and if their messages were often irritatingly self-righteous, the situations and settings were, nevertheless, excitingly modern and relevant.\"</p> <p>Despite his proselytising air, Kramer himself explained: \"I was spawned during the Roosevelt era, a time of great change. I still believe in getting people to think, but I don't believe films change anyone's mind.\"</p> <p>After a tough childhood in the Hell's Kitchen district of New York, Kramer took a degree in business administration at New York University. At 21, he got a job as an assistant writer at 20th-Century Fox, moving on to become apprentice senior editor at MGM. There, he acquired the sense of structure that enabled him to edit in the camera with minimal wastage.</p> <p>He became a production assistant on So Ends Our Night (1941), about three people forced to flee the Nazis in 1937, while the United States was still at peace with Germany. Prejudice, in all its forms, would become a central theme of his work. During the war, he joined the US Army Signal Corps, and helped make training films.</p> <p>Kramer then set up his own production company, its first film being So This Is New York (1948), an unusual and amusing comedy directed by Richard Fleischer and based on Ring Lardner's novel The Big Town. The following year, he started to make his reputation as one of the most enterprising and successful independent producers by making economical, but serious, films just outside the Hollywood mainstream. In fact, Kramer was more instrumental than any other independent producer in breaking the stranglehold of the major studios, thus giving the movie industry a shot in the arm.</p> <p>The two films that set him on his way were both directed by Mark Robson and written by Carl Foreman in 1949: Champion, a powerful study of ruthless ambition starring Kirk Douglas as a boxer who gets his comeuppance, and Home Of The Brave, which courageously took on the subject of racial prejudice in the US army; the main character was changed from a Jew in the stage play to a black man. It was one of the first American pictures to deal with the topic, preparing the way for other explorations of racial bigotry.</p> <p>In 1950, Kramer became even more prominent with Cyrano de Bergerac, an effective showcase for Jos\u00e9 Ferrer's Oscar-winning performance, and The Men, directed by Fred Zinnemann and written by Foreman, an uncompromising movie starring Marlon Brando as the former GI paralysed from the waist down. This was followed by a faithful screen version of Arthur Miller's poignant play Death Of A Salesman (1951), directed by Laszlo Benedek.</p> <p>A year later came two Zinnemann-directed pictures - Member Of The Wedding, an excellent transposition of Carson McCullers' novel about adolescence, and High Noon, probably the high-water mark of the careers of Kramer as producer, Zinnemann as director, Foreman as writer and Gary Cooper as actor. Ironically, Columbia, which was releasing Kramer's films, suggested he give \"the western without action\" to United Artists. He went on to produce The Wild One (1953), with Brando starring and Benedek directing. Faithful to a small circle of collaborators, Kramer hired Edward Dmytryk, who had recanted after being blacklisted by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, to direct three of his productions, notably The Caine Mutiny (1954).</p> <p>It was in 1955 that Kramer decided to direct his own productions, something he did in a heartfelt but rather heavy-handed manner, keeping a shrewd eye on both the box-office and the Oscar donors. His first was the torpid hospital drama Not As A Stranger (1955), with Dr Robert Mitchum acting as if under anaesthetic. He then spent $5m on The Pride And The Passion (1957), a few cents of which could have been spent on a pair of scissors and a red pencil. Yet this sprawling, 130-minute epic, starring Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra and Sophia Loren, earned its money back.</p> <p>The Defiant Ones (1958) was an advance on Hollywood's usual treatment of racial themes, though a chain was the clankingly obvious symbol which bound racist Tony Curtis to Sidney Poitier, both convicts on the run. When the chain is finally severed, they are bound by an iron friendship. The picture won five nominations and two Oscars for the screenplay and cinematography. In all, Kramer's films won 15 Oscars in various categories and one for lifetime achievement.</p> <p>Kramer claimed to have been inspired to make On The Beach (1959) by a letter from his nine-year-old son's teacher asking: \"In the event of nuclear war, do you want your son to remain at school or will you call for him?\" The anti-nuclear scientist Linus Pauling remarked: \"Some years from now we can look back and say On The Beach is the movie that saved the world.\"</p> <p>Aside from a sense of urgency from a young couple, however, most of the characters behaved as if the atomic war was little more than an irksome interruption to a cocktail party. The last image of the film was a banner saying, \"There is still time, brothers!\" - a judicious warning to audiences at the height of the cold war. The real message was that, although nuclear war is bad for the health, it is good for the box-office. Extremely successful financially as his films were, Kramer claimed: \"The worst enemies of the motion-picture industry are the critics whose highest praise is the word 'commercial'.\"</p> <p>The subject of his next film, Inherit The Wind (1960) was the famous \"monkey trial\" of 1925, in which a US schoolteacher was tried for teaching Darwin's theory of evolution. The well-staged battle that takes place in the stifling courtroom came down to a struggle for acting honours between the underplaying Spencer Tracy and the overplaying Fredric March.</p> <p>Nothing if not ambitious, Kramer then tackled Judgment At Nuremberg (1961), dealing with the 1948 trial of four German judges accused of crimes against humanity. For 190 minutes, the arguments were shouted across the court, calmly presided over by Spencer Tracy, who has the last, self-righteous word in the matter. Despite its laboured treatment and film-star witnesses, the movie must be commended for attempting to analyse one of the great issues of the 20th century, and it was presumably informative to a public that paid more than $3.5m dollars to see it.</p> <p>Putting gloom behind him, Kramer next paid a gigantic homage to slapstick comedy with It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), filmed in Ultra Panavision 70 (a form of Cinerama). The movie impressed cumulatively with its vast roster of comedians, past and present, its sheer size, and the number of pratfalls and spectacular stunts. The characters are all led on a trail of greed by Jimmy Durante, who gives a clue to the whereabouts of buried loot just before he dies, literally kicking a bucket. This cynical, and often funny, movie made off with more than $10m.</p> <p>Ship Of Fools (1965), an adaptation of Katherine Anne Porter's hefty novel, weighing in at 148 minutes, made the best of an excellent cast, including Vivien Leigh in her final screen role and Jos\u00e9 Ferrer as an anti-semite. Guess Who's Coming To Dinner (1967), about a liberal, white middle-class couple coming to terms with their daughter's wish to marry a black man, provided an ideal vehicle for Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy to co-star for the last time.</p> <p>Kramer knew he was taking an enormous risk in hiring the ailing Tracy. When an insurance company refused to cover the star, he accepted personal responsibility for any financial loss should Tracy die during shooting. As Tracy delivered his last line to Hepburn - \"If what they feel for each other is even half what we felt, then that is everything\" - she was not the only one moved to tears. In the event, Tracy died a few months later.</p> <p>Kramer was never able to repeat his huge triumphs of those earlier decades. The wartime comedy, The Secret Of Santa Vittoria (1969), was too long and loud (it starred the undemure Anthony Quinn and Anna Magnani), and with RPM (1970), he failed to catch the momentum of student revolution. At the time, during a talk at Stanford University, he declared: \"I've been fighting the establishment for 30 years, and I still don't know what the establishment is.\" A student stood up and said: \"Maybe because it's you.\"</p> <p>Undaunted, in Bless The Beasts And Children (1971), Kramer addressed the issue of endangered species, but it was the producer-director who was identified with disappearing buffalo. After The Runner Stumbles (1979), about a priest (Dick Van Dyke) falling for a nun (Kathleen Quinlan), failed at the box office, he decided that \"somewhere between films on outer space and [Sylvester] Stallone, there was no place for me\".</p> <p>He left Hollywood for Seattle, where he wrote a weekly column for the Seattle Times. \"I felt that after being half a step ahead for many years, I was suddenly half a step behind,\" he said. \"This helped me catch up again.\" When David Puttnam became president of Columbia Pictures in 1986, he asked Kramer to deliver new projects. Typically, the great man hoped to make a film on the Chernobyl disaster, but nothing came of it.</p> <p>Kramer, is survived by his second wife, Karen Sharpe Kramer, and two daughters, and a son and daughter from his first marriage, to Anne Pierce. He will be remembered fondly as a producer-director who made films with universally significant subjects, valiantly continuing to do so while American cinema, on the whole, became increasingly trivial.</p> <p>\u0095 Stanley Earl Kramer, film-maker, born September 29 1913; died February 19 2001</p>",

Last night he conjured up something just as dramatic to knock his old club out of this season's competition, book a sixth-round tie at Leicester and enhance his reputation as one of the country's best up-and-coming managers. </p> <p> After seeing his Second Division side come back dramatically to equalise from 2-0 down in Saturday's first tie, he watched as they were reduced to 10 men but still displayed the never-say-die attitude that characterised the Wimbledon team Sanchez played in for 10 years.</p> <p> They twice came back from a goal down to win 8-7 in the shoot-out after Wimbledon's Mark Williams missed the 20th penalty kick. </p> <p> The rest of an unbelievably eventful plot had unfolded like this. First Wimbledon took the lead when Gareth Ainsworth grabbed a breakaway goal after Wycombe themselves had almost scored. </p> <p> The visitors equalised when Andy Rammel's shot was parried by the Wimbledon keeper and the long-serving Dave Carroll converted the rebound.</p> <p> Wycombe, however, were hit badly when Rammell, their leading scorer, had to limp off and his replacement Andy Baird was carried off on a stretcher four minutes later after an awful challenge from Williams. The defender was only booked. </p> <p> Wimbledon dominated after the restart and Wycombe's hopes were further hit when Michael Simpson was sent off for a second yellow card on 70 minutes.

      "bodyText": "This last week has been all about Wycombe's manager Lawrie Sanchez reliving memories of scoring the FA Cup final winner for Wimbledon in 1988. Last night he conjured up something just as dramatic to knock his old club out of this season's competition, book a sixth-round tie at Leicester and enhance his reputation as one of the country's best up-and-coming managers. After seeing his Second Division side come back dramatically to equalise from 2-0 down in Saturday's first tie, he watched as they were reduced to 10 men but still displayed the never-say-die attitude that characterised the Wimbledon team Sanchez played in for 10 years. They twice came back from a goal down to win 8-7 in the shoot-out after Wimbledon's Mark Williams missed the 20th penalty kick. The rest of an unbelievably eventful plot had unfolded like this. First Wimbledon took the lead when Gareth Ainsworth grabbed a breakaway goal after Wycombe themselves had almost scored. The visitors equalised when Andy Rammel's shot was parried by the Wimbledon keeper and the long-serving Dave Carroll converted the rebound. Wycombe, however, were hit badly when Rammell, their leading scorer, had to limp off and his replacement Andy Baird was carried off on a stretcher four minutes later after an awful challenge from Williams. The defender was only booked. Wimbledon dominated after the restart and Wycombe's hopes were further hit when Michael Simpson was sent off for a second yellow card on 70 minutes. But they looked to be holding on for extra-time when, with only a minute left, Wimbledon were awarded a penalty after Paul McCarthy appeared to handle Marcus Gayle's cross. However, Martin Taylor saved Neal Ardley's penalty. Wycombe's relief was short lived. Thirty-four seconds into extra-time Wayne Gray picked up Jason Euell's knock-on and shot Wimbledon into the lead with his first senior goal. This was both teams' third replay in this season's competition but it was Wycombe who were feeling the pressure as Taylor was forced into a great save to deny Euell. As extra-time ticked away Wanderers' best run in this competition looked to be over. But with 30 seconds remaining they benefited from another slice of luck to go with their blatantly offside equaliser on Saturday. Dannie Bulman, in front of goal, sliced his shot but it found McCarthy on the far post and he found the net. Wimbledon's manager Terry Burton protested so vehemently that McCarthy was offside that he was banished from the bench. Burton watched from the stand as Wycombe won the shoot-out and perhaps the most famous victory in their history. Sanchez took the plaudits from the Wycombe faithful who made up half the crowd.

The advertising market is already being hit by the economic downturn. The dramatic slump in the US economy is prompting many big advertisers to rein in their marketing budgets. WPP today reflected this when it reported full-year profits in line with analysts' expectations, but warned of \"economic uncertainties\" over the next few years. \"Economic conditions in North America are now, to say the least, more challenging,\" said WPP in statement. Despite reporting a rise in pre-tax profit from \u00a3318m in 1999 to \u00a3365m last year, any admission of weakness in the North American market will damage confidence in a company that generates 46% of its revenues in the US. WPP admitted the uncertainty is set to continue because the measures being taken to rekindle the US economy could cause long-term damage. \"The real economic challenge may come not in 2001 but in 2002 if lower interest rates and US tax cuts overheat the economy,\" said WPP. However, WPP's aggressive acquisition policy helped push up revenues by 37% to \u00a32.98bn. The group bought New York-based rival Young &amp; Rubicam in a \u00a32.6bn deal last year, adding the company to a portfolio that includes J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather.

In a swingeing editorial on the the Harmsworth dynasty, the Express attacks \"the hypocrisy\" of the aristocratic proprietors of the Daily Mail, which has \"for decades piously preached about patriotism and family values\". It tells its readers that while the Mail likes to push family values and is filled with indignation at those it regards as responsible for moral decline in the this country, members of the Rothermere family, now dead, have been guilty of adultery, multiple marriages, divorce and drug abuse. And the Express also points out that the current head of the family, Viscount Rothermere, has fathered an illegitimate son. \"Theirs was a dysfunctional family long before the term was invented,\" says the Express. The double-page spread is confirmation of Richard Desmond's determination to lure readers from the Mail. The strategy follows disastrous set of circulation figures, which showed sales for the Express dropping below the 1m mark. Sources say Mr Desmond, who took over the Express last year, believes the Mail is \"fair game\" following its blistering attack on his pornography empire, which publishes titles such as Forum and Asian babes. The Express article - carrying no byline - goes on to chronicle examples of the Mail dynasty's hypocrisy. It pictures Harold Sidney Harmsworth, a Nazi sympathiser, standing next to Adolf Hitler. And its lengthy headline notes that Vere Rothermere, the third Viscount, kept a mistress for 15 years while his wife, fondly known as Bubbles, was still alive. And in a bid to steal the mantle of the paper of family values, the Express regurgitates Vere Rothermere's candid last interview. In this, Vere Rothermere made it plain that even he didn't agree with the Mail's simplistic conservatism. He said: \"Family values - what does that phrase mean? \"I've not the least idea!

      "body": "<p>The NHS is one of the great failures of the Blair government. Are there better ways of achieving the NHS ideal of universal access? An open-minded appraisal of European systems would show that there are. </p> <p>But instead of showing how social democratic France, Germany and the Netherlands have systems which combine consumer choice, health insurance and a measure of personal payment in different ways which guarantee the poorest people a higher standard of care than under the NHS, the pusillanimous Tories have been paralysed by fear that Labour will unfairly accuse them of being ready to ride roughshod over the interests of the poor. </p> <p>In which leading European country is there the widest gap between the standard of care available to the poor and that enjoyed by the rich? The answer is the UK: the rich can always take care of themselves, but the poor rely on the government and in this country the state provides only a low standard. </p> <p>Take France as an example. France has a reputation for central direction but French healthcare is based on a compromise between egalitarianism and liberalism.

      "bodyText": "The NHS is one of the great failures of the Blair government. Are there better ways of achieving the NHS ideal of universal access? An open-minded appraisal of European systems would show that there are. But instead of showing how social democratic France, Germany and the Netherlands have systems which combine consumer choice, health insurance and a measure of personal payment in different ways which guarantee the poorest people a higher standard of care than under the NHS, the pusillanimous Tories have been paralysed by fear that Labour will unfairly accuse them of being ready to ride roughshod over the interests of the poor. In which leading European country is there the widest gap between the standard of care available to the poor and that enjoyed by the rich? The answer is the UK: the rich can always take care of themselves, but the poor rely on the government and in this country the state provides only a low standard. Take France as an example. France has a reputation for central direction but French healthcare is based on a compromise between egalitarianism and liberalism. All citizens are said to be equal; yet, choice and competition are fiercely protected. In France, individuals can identify on their pay slips how much they are paying and form a view about whether the cost is justified. Consequently, the standard of care guaranteed by the state reflects the personal preferences of people who are self-sufficient through work.

      "bodyText": "Lord Hollick's radically transformed United Business Media has been knocked by analysts, who fear it will be hit by shockwaves from the crumbling US technology market. United Business Media became a business publishing group late last year. It dumped its old name of United News &amp; Media along with its ITV franchises and the Express newspaper group. However, the media team at ABN Amro have questioned the timing of the move, saying the group's close ties with the US market have made it the most exposed European media stock. \"We believe the transition is poorly timed given the significant slowdown in US hi-tech advertising. \"There is a significant risk of earnings disappointments and downgrades,\" said ABN. The ABN team said more than 80% of United's profits come from the US market and advertising provides 67% of the group's revenues. \"We believe recent trading statements from US companies with a hi-tech exposure point to a significant downturn in the advertising outlook,\" ABN added. The US technology sector has been hit by a series of profit warnings and job cuts at the likes of Motorola, Microsoft and Intel, which have borne the brunt of a slowing national economy. United's portfolio includes the CMP magazine group, PR Newswire and the United Information market research group. The majority of analysts who cover the company give it a \"buy\" rating. United made \u00a33.2bn from selling off its consumer assets last year. However, the ABN team said the group's plan to reinvest the windfall in a share buy-back scheme would not be enough to support the company's stock. ABN said the buy-back has already affected United's share price. Attention will soon revert to the company's core businesses, which faces stiff year-on-year revenue comparisons. United's shares, which ABN have kept on a \"reduce\" rating, slipped 2% to 762p by late afternoon trading. United was not available for comment.",

      "body": "<p>Persuading the NHS to extend its remit amid countless budgetary demands is a tough job. However, two years ago cash was found to set up a department for religious, spiritual and cultural care in Newham, east London. And a report out today shows how the initiative has forged links between people with mental health problems and their faith communities, while raising awareness among health and social care staff of the importance of religion. </p> <p>The department was the brainchild of Nigel Copsey, an ordained minister and resident of London's east end for most of his life. Some 40% of his local population - one in two of whom is black or Asian - is estimated to have links with a faith group. No fewer than 294 religious organisations are active locally, covering almost the entire spectrum of major world religions, with the exception of Judaism - although the population of neighbouring Hackney is 12% Jewish. </p> <p>Copsey spent two years researching how best to provide mental health services within such multi-faith communities. He says: \"Religion is inextricably bound with culture, and as fundamental to the lives of many minority ethnic communities as food and drink. Faith communities are the most significant group within the local population. People understandably become suspicious when the secular and spiritual are separated.\" </p> <p>The western psychiatric model traditionally excludes spiritual dimensions and overlooks the significance of religion in people's lives. Indeed, in many cases, Copsey found that faiths attribute what British society would describe as mental illness to \"spiritual sickness\". </p> <p>Despite the recent declaration by health and social care minister John Hutton that development and delivery of culturally appropriate services can no longer be regarded as optional, it can still prove very hard to get such issues on to the NHS agenda.

      "bodyText": "Persuading the NHS to extend its remit amid countless budgetary demands is a tough job. However, two years ago cash was found to set up a department for religious, spiritual and cultural care in Newham, east London. And a report out today shows how the initiative has forged links between people with mental health problems and their faith communities, while raising awareness among health and social care staff of the importance of religion. The department was the brainchild of Nigel Copsey, an ordained minister and resident of London's east end for most of his life. Some 40% of his local population - one in two of whom is black or Asian - is estimated to have links with a faith group. No fewer than 294 religious organisations are active locally, covering almost the entire spectrum of major world religions, with the exception of Judaism - although the population of neighbouring Hackney is 12% Jewish. Copsey spent two years researching how best to provide mental health services within such multi-faith communities. He says: \"Religion is inextricably bound with culture, and as fundamental to the lives of many minority ethnic communities as food and drink. Faith communities are the most significant group within the local population. People understandably become suspicious when the secular and spiritual are separated.\" The western psychiatric model traditionally excludes spiritual dimensions and overlooks the significance of religion in people's lives. Indeed, in many cases, Copsey found that faiths attribute what British society would describe as mental illness to \"spiritual sickness\". Despite the recent declaration by health and social care minister John Hutton that development and delivery of culturally appropriate services can no longer be regarded as optional, it can still prove very hard to get such issues on to the NHS agenda. Copsey admits to having been incredibly lucky in having had full support from the outset from leaders of the East London and City mental health trust. He stresses that the department needed to reflect the area's diversity, moving way from the chaplaincy model. \"Other places tried to launch similar initiatives by appointing chaplains and assistants, but neither an imam nor a priest can cover the range of religions,\" he says. \"The department clearly needed to be run by a neutral coordinator to assess what's there and what's needed.\" The first coordinator was an Asian woman with Hindu and Christian backgrounds, who was also a trained counselling psychologist.

These workers have proved invaluable in liaising with patients, who may not speak English well enough to explain their religious needs to staff. As shown in today's report, Forward in Faith, published by the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, many such patients fear they will be labelled psychotic, then compulsorily detained and forcibly medicated - the faith that they need most at a time of crisis itself becoming a burden. The team applies an action research model - asking patients on the wards what they want - which Copsey stresses is vital to \"turn findings into action that results in social change\". But simple changes of fundamental importance to many patients can be surprisingly complex to implement, as the department found when it discovered that the needs of Muslim men during Ramadan were being overlooked. Although their hospital had a prayer room, it was unfurnished, contained no religious symbols, and few staff and patients knew it existed. The department set about making the room welcoming, buying prayer mats and publicising its existence, and produced a staff handout explaining the meaning of the festival and related issues, such as prayer times and fasting.

But he then rejected an offer of \u00a3202.80, the cost of buying the tea bags commercially, and also knocked back an increased offer of \u00a3750 for the name. Mr Stewart increased his demand to \u00a37,500, plus legal expenses. David Perkins, a member of the ruling panel, said Mr Stewart had intended to \"tarnish and damage\" Connolly's name, and rejected the suggestion that the website could be named after the dog, whose kennel name was Rougemar Pindar. He ruled that Mr Stewart was using the name in bad faith, and that he was in the business of buying and selling celebrity domain names. The UN introduced the system of control to prevent \"cybersquatters\" profiteering by buying celebrity domain names for a few dollars and selling them for vast sums.",

Sixty-seven per cent of the company's 131,000 workforce responded to the survey, an increase on the 63% response rate the year before.

The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that an advertisement showing the lower legs and feet of a person looking down over the edge of a tall building, alongside the words, \"Go on. Jump\" was irresponsible. The ASA received several complaints about the poster, which advertised a documentary about the extreme sport of base jumping. Anti-suicide charity the Samaritans was one of the complainants. \"We lodged a complaint because we felt this ad was highly misleading,\" said a spokeswoman for the Samaritans. \"It was a blatant referral to suicide and that can lead to copycat cases.\" Another complaint came from Camden Council's assistant director for housing, who said the poster was offensive because a tower block near the one shown had been used in three recent suicides. But Channel 4 said it did not believe it had behaved irresponsibly. It said it had made every effort to ensure the poster conveyed clearly that the programme was about base jumping and not suicide by replacing the title of the show, Seconds to Impact, with the line \"confessions of a base jumper\". The ASA also upheld a complaint against Honda cars. A member of the public complained a national press advert promising \"the opportunity of a lifetime\" was misleading because it promised more reductions that were in fact available. Honda has since withdrawn the advert. Separately, the ASA has referred Planet Telecom, a company that specialises in sending unsolicited faxes on a variety of subjects to other organisations, to the Office of Fair Trading. The watchdog has called on the OFT to take action against Planet Telecom under the control of misleading advertisements regulations. The decision follows repeated violations of the ASA's regulations by the Wigan-based company. The first ruling was published three years ago after Planet Telecom sent out a fax headed \"paedophiles in your neighbourhood\". The ASA concluded the fax condoned violence and was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. \"This sends out a clear message to those advertisers that do not abide by the rules of self-regulation. \"The ASA will, when necessary, resort to its ultimate sanction of referring advertisers to the OFT to ensure advertisements remain legal, decent, honest and truthful,\" said ASA director general Christopher Graham.",

The Treasury said a cut in environmentally friendly ultra-low sulphur petrol, signalled by Chancellor Gordon Brown his pre-budget report last November, would be matched by a similar, temporary reduction in the duty on unleaded fuel. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Timms, said the measure was being introduced because independent petrol retailers had been unable to guarantee that ULSP would be available nationwide at all their outlets by budget day. \"One of the reasons we are doing it is to ensure there is no competitive disadvantage for independent retailers,\" Mr Timms told a news conference at the Treasury. The duty cut in unleaded fuel will run until June 14. In the pre-budget report, Mr Brown indicated that he was prepared to cut the duty on ULSP - which has already been reduced by 1p since October - by a further 2p, subject to consultation. It was part of a carefully crafted package drawn up by the chancellor to assuage the concerns of the fuel tax protesters without appearing to give too much ground. He said at the time that he expected ULSP to account for 100% of the market this year, with motorists \"using any petrol station in Britain\" able to benefit from a duty cut on budget day. Mr Timms said that at a meeting today which he attended with the transport minister, Lord Macdonald, the major oil companies had said they were on track to meet their target to supply ULSP at all their filling stations by the end of March. However, the independent retailers, who met ministers separately, said they would need more time to ensure that ULSP was available at all their 5,000 outlets - many serving remote areas - because of constraints on the capacity of UK oil refineries. Mr Timms said: \"The government's objectives are to ensure that everyone should be able to share the environmental benefits of ULSP, and the benefits of the duty cut associated with it.\" Talk about it Discuss the petrol crisis Related articles 20.02.2001: Opec warns of supply cuts 14.02.2001: Calls for windfall tax after BP's record profit Quiz: Do you know your oil?

For 42%, euro entry would enhance company valuations while 4% thought they would be reduced. </p> <p>Fund managers were bullish about prospects of improving sales and profits through the euro: 54% said joining would improve sales and 45% said it would help profits. </p> <p>The study shows views on the euro vary between business sectors. Car and component manufacturers were firmly positive while electricity and metals firms were negative. Those responses reflected different sectors' existing exposure to the European currency, said Stephen Parker, chief executive at Tempest. </p> <p>Larger companies were already increasingly thinking outside their national boundaries when communicating with financial audiences.

      "bodyText": "The City yesterday gave a strong vote in favour of joining the euro even though Britain's largest companies say it will make relatively little difference to profits. The European currency is seen as beneficial by 63% of larger companies and 68% of British fund managers, in an annual survey for the information group Reuters. The main advantage of joining the euro lay in its impact on the cost of financing and valuations, said respondents to the survey compiled by Tempest Consultants. A quarter of big companies questioned said being in the system would reduce financing costs while only 3% thought it would make things more difficult. For 42%, euro entry would enhance company valuations while 4% thought they would be reduced. Fund managers were bullish about prospects of improving sales and profits through the euro: 54% said joining would improve sales and 45% said it would help profits. The study shows views on the euro vary between business sectors. Car and component manufacturers were firmly positive while electricity and metals firms were negative. Those responses reflected different sectors' existing exposure to the European currency, said Stephen Parker, chief executive at Tempest. Larger companies were already increasingly thinking outside their national boundaries when communicating with financial audiences. Respondents said they planned to spend far more time talking to foreign fund managers and brokers. \"Together with fund management groups' views on the euro and the declining role of UK equities in global portfolios, this is leading to the adoption of a more international investment perspective,\" Tempest said. The UK equities market has underperformed other European markets and now accounts for less than 10% of a neutral global portfolio. Tempest argues it is difficult to see how the British market can stand alone. \"All three parts of our Equity Triangle [quoted companies, fund managers and sell-side analysts] are telling us that the future of UK equities market is inextricably linked to the global market place and to a European equity market in particular.

The treasury said there would be no irresponsible pre-election giveaway that might risk a repeat of the boom-bust cycles of the past.</p> <p>Mr Brown is thought to have pencilled in tax cuts worth \u00a33bn over two years on top of the increases in pensions and cuts in fuel duties announced in November, fearing that a more expansionary set of measures would put the stability of the economy at risk.</p> <p>However, with all parties gearing up for an election in April or May, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats seized on yesterday's data to attack the chancellor's tax and spending plans.</p> <p>Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said: \"The public finance figures out today confirm that Brown's war chest is overflowing. It's hardly surprising - spending under Labour has been below even Conservative plans. The chancellor should use the Budget to boost schools, hospitals and pensions instead of following the Tory agenda of tax cuts.\"</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, said any Budget surplus was a \"people's surplus\". \"It has only arisen because Gordon Brown has over-taxed British people,\" he said. \"If the chancellor can afford to cut taxes in the Budget he should do so, but people will know he will only be giving back a tiny proportion of the taxes he has already taken.\"</p> <p>Figures released jointly by the Treasury and Office for National Statistics showed that the public sector was in surplus in January by \u00a311.2bn, taking the cumulative total to \u00a316.7bn in the first 10 months of the financial year.</p> <p>Departmental spending on salaries and running costs picked up this year but was outstripped by the increase in tax revenues, boosted by the fall in unemployment and higher consumer spending.</p> <p>The size of the Treasury's surplus is also being affected by a continued shortfall in capital spending. In the 1999-2000 financial year spending on the infrastructure stood at \u00a33.5bn, less than the Conservatives were spending during their last year in power before 1997.</p> <p>Amid concerns about the decaying fabric of the public realm, Mr Brown authorised an increase to \u00a37bn this year, but in the first 10 months of the year only \u00a32. 2bn has been spent. Even if last year's surge in capital spending in February and March is repeated, the figure would only rise to around \u00a34.5bn.</p> <p>Geoffrey Dicks, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"If February and March pan out as per last year, the surplus will be \u00a318bn, way above pre-Budget estimates.\"</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said last night: \"The chancellor has said many times over many years that he is not going to repeat the mistakes of the late 1980s and take long-term decisions about the public finances on the basis of short term fluctuations in revenue.</p> <p>\"Because of the tough decisions this government has been prepared to take we are now building a virtuous circle of falling debt, lower interest rates, lower debt repayments and a stronger economy, releasing more resources for public services. The chancellor will do nothing which puts this hard-won stability at risk.\"</p> <p>Mr Portillo said the Conservatives would offer \"sustainable tax cuts\" over and above any changes announced in the Budget. \"This is because we plan to keep the growth of government spending within what the nation can afford, whereas Labour plan to increase government spending faster than the economy is growing.\"</p>",

They added that the size of Mr Brown's war chest - which excludes the \u00a322.5bn from selling off mobile phone licences - looked certain to dwarf the modest package of targeted tax cuts planned for the Budget. But officials insisted that there would be no back-tracking on the chancellor's hardline stance. The treasury said there would be no irresponsible pre-election giveaway that might risk a repeat of the boom-bust cycles of the past. Mr Brown is thought to have pencilled in tax cuts worth \u00a33bn over two years on top of the increases in pensions and cuts in fuel duties announced in November, fearing that a more expansionary set of measures would put the stability of the economy at risk. However, with all parties gearing up for an election in April or May, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats seized on yesterday's data to attack the chancellor's tax and spending plans. Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said: \"The public finance figures out today confirm that Brown's war chest is overflowing. It's hardly surprising - spending under Labour has been below even Conservative plans. The chancellor should use the Budget to boost schools, hospitals and pensions instead of following the Tory agenda of tax cuts.\" The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, said any Budget surplus was a \"people's surplus\". \"It has only arisen because Gordon Brown has over-taxed British people,\" he said. \"If the chancellor can afford to cut taxes in the Budget he should do so, but people will know he will only be giving back a tiny proportion of the taxes he has already taken.\" Figures released jointly by the Treasury and Office for National Statistics showed that the public sector was in surplus in January by \u00a311.2bn, taking the cumulative total to \u00a316.7bn in the first 10 months of the financial year. Departmental spending on salaries and running costs picked up this year but was outstripped by the increase in tax revenues, boosted by the fall in unemployment and higher consumer spending. The size of the Treasury's surplus is also being affected by a continued shortfall in capital spending. In the 1999-2000 financial year spending on the infrastructure stood at \u00a33.5bn, less than the Conservatives were spending during their last year in power before 1997. Amid concerns about the decaying fabric of the public realm, Mr Brown authorised an increase to \u00a37bn this year, but in the first 10 months of the year only \u00a32. 2bn has been spent. Even if last year's surge in capital spending in February and March is repeated, the figure would only rise to around \u00a34.5bn. Geoffrey Dicks, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"If February and March pan out as per last year, the surplus will be \u00a318bn, way above pre-Budget estimates.\" A Treasury spokesman said last night: \"The chancellor has said many times over many years that he is not going to repeat the mistakes of the late 1980s and take long-term decisions about the public finances on the basis of short term fluctuations in revenue. \"Because of the tough decisions this government has been prepared to take we are now building a virtuous circle of falling debt, lower interest rates, lower debt repayments and a stronger economy, releasing more resources for public services. The chancellor will do nothing which puts this hard-won stability at risk.\" Mr Portillo said the Conservatives would offer \"sustainable tax cuts\" over and above any changes announced in the Budget. \"This is because we plan to keep the growth of government spending within what the nation can afford, whereas Labour plan to increase government spending faster than the economy is growing.\"",

Al Kasaba started over 20 years ago in East Jerusalem. Inad - \"stubborn\" - Theatre is a smaller and newer community theatre near Bethlehem. </p> <p>In 1995 Dodgson and Daldry visited Israeli and Palestinian theatres and met George Ibrahim, director of Al Kasaba. He introduced them to a young director, Raeda Ghazaleh, who had learned Hebrew to get a theatre training not available on the West Bank. She was invited to the Royal Court, where she worked as Stephen Daldry's assistant on Ron Hutchinson's play Rat in the Skull. </p> <p>Over the next few years Palestinian playwrights came to the Royal Court and the Royal Court sent Stephen Jeffreys, April de Angelis and Phyllida Lloyd to work with young writers in Bethlehem, Ramallah, Nablus, Hebron and Jericho. The Royal Court encouraged David Hare to visit the area, which led to his writing Via Dolorosa, a monologue based on the troubled politics of the region. </p> <p>Meanwhile, because access to Jerusalem was becoming increasingly difficult for Palestinians, George Ibrahim decided to move Al Kasaba to Ramallah. He took over a disused cinema and planned a 250-seat theatre, a cinema and a cafe. Ghazaleh and some friends had started Inad when she was a student, and the group moved into an empty garage in Beit Jala. By 1999 Inad had converted the garage into a theatre space and Al Kasaba opened its new theatre last summer. But now both theatres are under threat. </p> <p>Inad has been concentrating particularly on working with children. It has a mobile theatre - a truck that it takes to schools, refugee camps, community centres and village squares, with five different plays for children as young as four or as old as 18. Inad's building was shelled on three nights and it is difficult for the truck to get about because of road closures. Barham writes about taking the truck to Hebron, where 1,500 children were waiting - looking for dirt tracks to avoid blocked roads, climbing over barriers of rocks and earth carrying sets and equipment, being turned back by shooting. But despite the difficulties they played to 31,000 children between September and the end of the year. </p> <p>At first, she writes, \"We thought after a week of violence it would be impossible to perform, since in our culture we cannot have any entertainment while people are in mourning.\" But to their surprise schools asked them to come. \"The headmasters said their students are suffering from traumas and were stunned by what was happening. They felt we could do something.\" She describes how the children were able to smile and laugh after being in shock, and how discussions after the shows helped them to share their fears. </p> <p>Al Kasaba has kept open despite the difficulties. People have been coming to the centre asking the actors to make theatre about what has been going on. Every day monologues have been performed about people's experiences, and some are being formed into a theatre piece. Barham's emails are being adapted for performance at a festival at Amman in Jordan, and Rose Fenton and Lucy Neal hope to bring both pieces to London for the London International Festival of Theatre this summer. </p> <p>But because there is now so much unemployment, with many Palestinians not allowed to travel to work, there is little money for theatre.

Both theatres are in danger of having to stop work. </p> <p>So this is why we are doing an extra performance of Far Away tomorrow at the Albery Theatre. All the money from ticket sales - normal price - will go to Al Kasaba and Inad. </p> <p>As I write, the latest news from Barham is that after a relatively quiet few weeks, the Israelis set up tanks in Beit Jala a few days ago, one opposite the theatre. From 8.30pm till midnight on February 13 there was shooting and shelling. Next morning Marina and her friends made jokes about Valentine's day and bought each other flowers.

In our solar system, they are perturbed by massive bodies.\" </p> <p>He examined only a fraction of the galaxy, but he assumed that it resembled the rest of the galaxy. \"I'm just making a statistical argument,\" he said. \"Probably more than half have accreted this material, and therefore probably more than half of the stars in our galaxy have accreted that material.

      "bodyText": "Age: 58. Appearance: Billy Bunter after a lifetime of oysters and champagne. Occupation: Gadfly. Politics: Exceedingly complicated. How so? McAlpine was treasurer of the Conservative party throughout Lady Thatcher's glorious reign, but loathed John Major and supported the Referendum party in 1997. He has now announced that he will be voting Labour at the next election. He doesn't think much of Hague, then? \"It kills me to say it, but Major is considerably superior to Hague. You can't shave your head and talk about the face of caring Conservatism.\" Remind us what he thought of Major: \"He was often at Chequers pretending to be a pair of curtains.\" And is his judgment to be trusted? Almost certainly not - he thinks that Margaret Thatcher has a sense of humour. What does he do these days? Travels between his homes in London and Monte Carlo, writes books on art and politics (he loves Machiavelli as well as Maggieavelli), and slags off the Tories. He's worth a packet, presumably. Hard to say. There's family money - \"Concrete Bob\" McAlpine was his great-grandfather - but he lost a fortune on property ventures in Australia, and said he was \"pretty much down to my last penny\" before he started writing. Life can be tough. It gets worse. He's just separated from his second wife, Romilly, despite the fact that she nursed him through a recent multiple heart bypass operation. How heartless. Er, yes. Explanation for his apparently bizarre behaviour: \"Deep down inside me, I think there is anger, though I've no reason to be angry. Everybody has been nice to me all my life.\" Clubs: Garrick, Carlton, Buck's, Pratt's, Beefsteak. Parties: Almost as numerous.",

It is bidding for the Wales and Borders train franchise and is on a short list of four. </p> <p>Final bids for the franchise are due to be submitted in May. \"The strategic rail authority is trying to operate a single railway for Wales,\" Mr Beeston said. \"It will be a government subsidised community service.\" </p> <p>The franchise will take in operations at present run by four different rail operators. </p> <p>Serco, which yesterday announced a 20% jump in profits for last year, has about 500 contracts for a wide range of activities, 90% of them for governments.

      "bodyText": "Serco, the business services group, is near to signing a \u00a3100m contract to build and operate a national road traffic control centre in Britain. Kevin Beeston, Serco's chief executive, said the centre would enable the police to have an overall view of traffic on motorways and trunk roads so they could divert traffic to avoid congestion. In addition the data gathered by the centre could be sold to outside organisations or used by Serco itself to provide other value-added services, such as warning motorists of delays. \"It could develop over time to a situation in which you could imagine someone who makes a regular journey getting a telephone call at home saying 'take a different route or leave half an hour earlier',\" Mr Beeston said. \"This is possible with the technology.\" Serco is in the final stage of negotiating the 10-year contract with the highways agency as a public finance initiative project. The group would have to invest about \u00a37.5m to build the centre and set up the monitoring system. Mr Beeston said that the UK transport sector was one of the growth areas for the group. It is bidding for the Wales and Borders train franchise and is on a short list of four. Final bids for the franchise are due to be submitted in May. \"The strategic rail authority is trying to operate a single railway for Wales,\" Mr Beeston said. \"It will be a government subsidised community service.\" The franchise will take in operations at present run by four different rail operators. Serco, which yesterday announced a 20% jump in profits for last year, has about 500 contracts for a wide range of activities, 90% of them for governments. They range from setting up and running complex IT projects to building and running prisons. It is the world's largest air traffic control operator and is seeking virtually to double the size of its ATC operations by acquiring control of Britain's National Air Traffic Services, which is responsible for the airspace over Britain and parts of the Atlantic.

      "bodyText": "A British businessman, three of whose wives have died in suspicious circumstances, was jailed for 13 years for murder yesterday - five years after a court originally ruled him not guilty. Kevin Sweeney, a 50-year-old computer publisher based in Holland, was cleared in 1996 of killing his third wife, Suzanne Davies, 35, by setting fire to their home in a \u00a3700,000 insurance swindle in July 1995. Yesterday he was convicted at the court of appeal in Den Bosch, Netherlands, after police pushed for a retrial - permitted by Dutch law if, as in this case, new evidence comes to light. The decision has prompted Scotland Yard to assess whether it should investigate the will of a previous wife, Beverly, who died of an alleged sudden heart attack at the age of 33 after taking out a life insurance policy worth \u00a3240,000, and just days after receiving a clean bill of health. The third Mrs Sweeney, the daughter of a former British Airways executive from Thame, Oxon, had been married for nine months when her naked body was discovered in the bedroom of their fire-ravaged home in the Dutch town of Steensel. The couple, who had met after she responded to his advert in the personal columns of Private Eye, had bought the \u00a3194,000 house on the Dutch-Belgian border three months before the fire, with a large mortgage in her name backed by big insurance policies. At the initial trial, police failed to prove Sweeney's guilt, but new evidence presented to the appeal court proved \"beyond any doubt\" that he had murdered his third wife. A meticulous reconstruction concluded that the fire was started deliberately, with experts testifying that they had found traces of an inflammable liquid on a carpet in the property. Investigators also discovered the home had been locked from the outside before the fire took hold, while further investigation into Sweeney's finances showed he stood to gain more than \u00a3700,000 from her death - \u00a3200,000 more than previously thought. Mrs Sweeney, who had married twice before and who left a daughter Charlotte, now nine, was said to have told friends shortly before her death that she was deeply unhappy with the relationship and that they were in financial difficulties. Friends have explained that she threatened to leave Sweeney, who allegedly enjoyed sadomasochistic pornography and introduced his wife to the sex clubs of Amsterdam, but that she felt \"she had a lot invested\". A former friend of his second wife, Beverley, has alleged that she witnessed the deceased's will, which left everything to her two children, but only after she died. Her husband was sole trustee after her death. Last night a Scotland Yard spokesman said: \"We have received a complaint regarding the alleged forging of a certain document and are considering what action to take.\" Sweeney also told police his first wife died in a car accident. Dutch police have also investigated the death of a former girlfriend in a car crash in America during the early 90s. After murdering Suzanne Davies, Sweeney, who at the time of his 1996 acquittal described marriage as \"wonderful to me\", married once again.",

      "bodyText": "Lord Irvine, the lord chancellor, will today reject claims he is destroying the judiciary's independence when he tells peers he is currently doing more than any of his predecessors to open up the judicial appointments process to independent scrutiny. In a long delayed counter-attack, he will point out the Lord Chancellor's department is interviewing for a new judicial appointments commissioner, responsible for handling complaints over judicial appointments. Officials inside the department are angry that Lord Irvine is being accused of a \"cash for wigs\" scandal in the same month they claim he is moving to lift the shroud of secrecy surrounding judicial appointments. His officials argued yesterday that the new commissioner will be entitled to attend all interviews and handle complaints, not just from a disappointed applicant, but also their representatives. The new appointment body is his own initiative and directly follows recommendations from Sir Leanard Peach, the former commissioner for public appointments. Conservatives yesterday renewed calls for Lord Irvine to resign following his admission that he sent a letter to leftwing lawyers urging them to give \u00a3200 at a Labour fundraising dinner earlier this month. Lord Irvine will reply today to an oral question tabled by Lord McNally, the Liberal Democrat peer. Lord McNally is not seeking a resignation, but challenging the lord chancellor's judgment. Sitting silently on the woolsack yesterday, he refused to respond when the shadow leader of the Lords, Lord Strathclyde, demanded an emergency statement. The leader of the Lords, Lady Jay, had contemptuously rejected the demand for a statement, accusing the Tories of \"a high level of opportunism\" and taking all their views from the newspaper delivery boy. The shadow lord chancellor, Lord Kingsland, yesterday wrote to Lord Irvine, calling on him to restore the \"probity\" of his office by releasing lists of lawyers attending and declining to attend a Labour fund-raising lunch on February 7, along with details of the funds they had given. Speaking on BBC radio earlier, Lord Kingsland defended Lord Irvine's record in appointing judges and QCs, saying he had always acted with \"absolute probity\". But Lord Kingsland later said that he did believe that Lord Irvine should resign. Tories insist Lord Irvine's refusal to come clean voluntarily on Sunday had made them demand his head. The lord chancellor stood down yesterday from a House of Lords case on which he had been due to sit next month as one of five judges. His spokesman said he had been obliged to take himself off the case because he had to attend a special cabinet committee to discuss the budget on the day it was set to start, March 7. But the House of Lords judicial office had not been told by late yesterday afternoon that they would have to draft in another judge for the case, which Lord Irvine had been listed to hear since January. The case is a compensation claim by three men abused as children by a housefather at a private school for maladjusted and vulnerable children. It is seen as an important test case to decide whether the owners of children's homes and schools are liable to pay compensation to children abused by one of their employees. Critics of the lord chancellor's dual role as judge and politician argue that he should not sit on any cases in which the state could have an interest in the result.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair last night served notice on Britain's European allies and his own party that he intends to make a \"pick up the phone\" friendship with President George Bush a major priority as the new Republican administration settles down in Washington.</p> <p>On the eve of Mr Blair's visit to the US and Canada, Downing Street insisted that choosing between the US and Europe was a \"false and foolish\" choice - and announced that the annual US-EU summit will, for the first time, be attached to the six monthly EU summit in Gothenburg on June 14.</p> <p>That will allow Mr Bush to meet all 15 EU leaders rather than the Swedish EU presidency. But the prime minister's spokesman made it plain that the switch from Democrats to Republicans in the White House would not affect Britain's self-declared status as the oldest ally of the US. That means closing ranks on divisive issues - most conspicuously the US plans to deploy a national missile defence (NMD) shield which British ministers have indicated already they will back, to the dismay of France.</p> <p>Basking in the prospect of being the first EU leader to pay court in Bush's Washington -and to spend a \"fairly relaxed and informal\" 24 hours at the presidential retreat of Camp David - No 10 invoked an emerging relationship of trust and confidence. \"It would allow the two men to engage in straight talking, problem solving and standing shoulder-to-shoulder against the likes of Saddam Hussein and Milosevic\", Alastair Campbell told reporters. \"In the kind of relationship he would like they would pick up the phone as they liked and talk over problem solving as they see it.\"</p> <p>With divisive controversies simmering over the EU's rapid reaction force, the US plan for NMD deployment and the renewed US-UK bombing of Iraq, Mr Blair's hopes may fall foul of both Labour backbenchers and EU colleagues.</p> <p>When British officials invoked London's historic cold war role as the bridge between Europe and the US, German reporters yesterday quoted back a remark made by a Schroder official in Berlin that \"the traffic on that bridge seems all one-way\", with Britain in the supplicant's role.</p> <p>Mr Campbell brushed such talk aside. \"The prime minister has always seen the notion that we have to choose between Europe and the US as a false choice and always a foolish choice,\" he said. Later he conceded: \"If we were to list the most important parts of his job, making sure he gets on with the US president would be pretty high on the list.\"</p> <p>All British prime ministers make varying successes of that task and Mr Blair did not make John Major's mistake of being identified with George Bush Snr, the man Bill Clinton defeated in 1992. But the ex-Texas governor's priorities lie more with Asia and Mexico - which he visited last week - than did Mr Clinton's.</p> <p>His global instincts are also more unilateralist than his predecessor's and there was no mention of Northern Ireland on the Blair agenda yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Blair will first visit Canada, and make a major speech to parliament in Ottawa. He and the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien, will jointly call for a new, world trade round after the abortive Seattle and Prague conferences. When Mr Blair flies south to Washington on Friday, Mr Bush is likely to agree.</p> <p>Trade between the EU and the US is trickier with the \"banana wars\" row threatening to produce US sanctions against EU luxury exports. But 98% of Atlantic trade is row-free, officials stressed yesterday.</p> <p>On the rapid reaction force, officials said much of the reporting had been misleading. \"What we have to do is set out the facts. The US would be opposed to it if it undermined Nato, and so would we.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair last night served notice on Britain's European allies and his own party that he intends to make a \"pick up the phone\" friendship with President George Bush a major priority as the new Republican administration settles down in Washington. On the eve of Mr Blair's visit to the US and Canada, Downing Street insisted that choosing between the US and Europe was a \"false and foolish\" choice - and announced that the annual US-EU summit will, for the first time, be attached to the six monthly EU summit in Gothenburg on June 14. That will allow Mr Bush to meet all 15 EU leaders rather than the Swedish EU presidency. But the prime minister's spokesman made it plain that the switch from Democrats to Republicans in the White House would not affect Britain's self-declared status as the oldest ally of the US. That means closing ranks on divisive issues - most conspicuously the US plans to deploy a national missile defence (NMD) shield which British ministers have indicated already they will back, to the dismay of France. Basking in the prospect of being the first EU leader to pay court in Bush's Washington -and to spend a \"fairly relaxed and informal\" 24 hours at the presidential retreat of Camp David - No 10 invoked an emerging relationship of trust and confidence. \"It would allow the two men to engage in straight talking, problem solving and standing shoulder-to-shoulder against the likes of Saddam Hussein and Milosevic\", Alastair Campbell told reporters. \"In the kind of relationship he would like they would pick up the phone as they liked and talk over problem solving as they see it.\" With divisive controversies simmering over the EU's rapid reaction force, the US plan for NMD deployment and the renewed US-UK bombing of Iraq, Mr Blair's hopes may fall foul of both Labour backbenchers and EU colleagues. When British officials invoked London's historic cold war role as the bridge between Europe and the US, German reporters yesterday quoted back a remark made by a Schroder official in Berlin that \"the traffic on that bridge seems all one-way\", with Britain in the supplicant's role. Mr Campbell brushed such talk aside. \"The prime minister has always seen the notion that we have to choose between Europe and the US as a false choice and always a foolish choice,\" he said. Later he conceded: \"If we were to list the most important parts of his job, making sure he gets on with the US president would be pretty high on the list.\" All British prime ministers make varying successes of that task and Mr Blair did not make John Major's mistake of being identified with George Bush Snr, the man Bill Clinton defeated in 1992. But the ex-Texas governor's priorities lie more with Asia and Mexico - which he visited last week - than did Mr Clinton's. His global instincts are also more unilateralist than his predecessor's and there was no mention of Northern Ireland on the Blair agenda yesterday. Mr Blair will first visit Canada, and make a major speech to parliament in Ottawa. He and the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien, will jointly call for a new, world trade round after the abortive Seattle and Prague conferences. When Mr Blair flies south to Washington on Friday, Mr Bush is likely to agree. Trade between the EU and the US is trickier with the \"banana wars\" row threatening to produce US sanctions against EU luxury exports. But 98% of Atlantic trade is row-free, officials stressed yesterday. On the rapid reaction force, officials said much of the reporting had been misleading. \"What we have to do is set out the facts. The US would be opposed to it if it undermined Nato, and so would we.\"",

The strategy would concentrate on the Iraqi leader's attempts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the finances of leading members of his regime.</p> <p>\"The mixture of measures, sanctions, military posture, oil revenues and enforcement around the borders, these are all elements that will be looked at again,\" a Downing Street policy maker said.</p> <p>A Foreign Office diplomat will meet US officials in Washington on Thursday to draw up a framework for more focused sanctions removing controls on civilian goods.</p> <p>US officials admit that the alliance between the US and Britain which has spearheaded the sanctions and upheld no-fly zones in the north and south of the country has begun to lose the public relations war.

      "bodyText": "The British government will discuss plans to impose \"smart\" sanctions on Iraq with the new US administration this week as opposition to the transatlantic policy against Saddam Hussein mounts throughout Europe and the Arab world. Foreign Office officials confirmed yesterday that the question of how to contain President Saddam would be high on the agenda when Tony Blair meets George Bush in Washington on Friday. Confirming a report in yesterday's Guardian, officials said the time had come to define a more \"clear-cut\" sanctions policy while highlighting President Saddam's repression of his people. The strategy would concentrate on the Iraqi leader's attempts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the finances of leading members of his regime. \"The mixture of measures, sanctions, military posture, oil revenues and enforcement around the borders, these are all elements that will be looked at again,\" a Downing Street policy maker said. A Foreign Office diplomat will meet US officials in Washington on Thursday to draw up a framework for more focused sanctions removing controls on civilian goods. US officials admit that the alliance between the US and Britain which has spearheaded the sanctions and upheld no-fly zones in the north and south of the country has begun to lose the public relations war. With governments across Europe lining up to condemn the strategy, the Washington-London axis looks increasingly isolated. But the new Bush administration is likely to follow a hawkish line, with the vice-president, Dick Cheney, and the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, loath to be seen granting any concessions to President Saddam. Fuelling speculation of a rift within the administration, the secretary of state, Colin Powell, has shown more readiness to shift the US stance on Iraq. He is likely to experience first-hand the extent of anger across the Arab world after last Friday's bombing raids on Baghdad by US and British planes. On Friday he is to begin his first trip abroad, aimed at selling the smart sanctions idea to America's Gulf war allies. State department officials have been assigned the task of retooling sanctions, so that Mr Powell will have new policies to offer Arab countries including Syria, Egypt and Jordan, which fear President Saddam's military intentions but face popular outrage about the trade embargo's perceived effect on ordinary Iraqis. In advance of the Blair-Bush meetings, officials on both sides of the Atlantic were yesterday emphasising that any change of policy should not be interpreted as a softening of approach on Iraq. Containment A British official said the objective would remain the same - \"containing Saddam, weapons of mass destruction and internal repression\". Brian Wilson, the new Foreign Office minister responsible for Iraq, told the BBC there were two strands to British policy. \"The first is to minimise the human impact and the second is to maximise the inability of Saddam Hussein to wage war on his own people, the region and the rest of the world,\" he said. The Iraqi leader, he said, had \"ruthlessly\" used the sanctions to blame the west for the suffering of his people and any changes to stop him doing that would be welcome. \"I have a positive desire to see sanctions developed in such a way that they do the only purpose that they are intended for,\" Mr Wilson said. Meanwhile Washington has given the US-funded Iraqi National Congress, the opposition coalition, the green light to move its operations back into its home country for the first time since it was forced out by Iraqi offensives in 1996. Some INC members will be given light weapons training, but the scope of the training is limited, and there are divisions within the Bush administration over how far to go in supporting the faction-ridden resistance movement. Anti-US and anti-British unrest on Arab streets has been heightened by the strikes against Iraqi anti-aircraft defences around Baghdad. The missile attack was intended to protect coalition air patrols from improved Iraqi air-defence batteries, but they have focused attention on the suffering of the Iraqi people. US officials insist that the hardships are imposed by the Iraqi government and not by the sanctions, which allow for the sale of Iraqi oil to buy food and medicines. \"Our goal [is] to make sure that Iraq complies with the arms control agreements it entered into and let's move beyond this,\" Mr Powell said last week on his first visit to the UN as secretary of state. Easing On his Middle East tour, Mr Powell is expected to suggest the easing of selected sanctions to allow Iraq to rebuild its civil infrastructure. The Bush administration is considering lifting \"holds\" on $3bn (\u00a32bn) in goods ordered by Baghdad, such as refrigerated trucks, which could in theory be used to transport weapons but are urgently required for civilian purposes - moving food and medical supplies. In his attempt to rejuvenate the sanctions policy, Mr Powell is expected to attempt to plug some of the big leaks in the oil embargo. He intends to confront Syrian officials over reports that Iraq is exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels of oil a day through the pipeline to Syria. Exports through Syria could be legitimised and included in the UN's oil for food programme. But the Baghdad regime is eager to maximise its illegal revenue; it is said to be using the pipeline to earn an extra $3m a day.

The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, said if last week's raids had been carried out in the context of purely military sanctions, they would have had more public support in the Arab world. The present sanctions policy had failed for 10 years and should have been reviewed long before now.

It should have happened before. It's just the market catching up with reality.\" </p> <p>A lacklustre showing from Wall Street, back in operation after Monday's holiday, also weighed on sentiment. By mid-afternoon in New York the Nasdaq index of technology shares was down 3%, extending Friday's sharp losses prompted by profits warnings from Nortel and Hewlett Packard. </p> <p>The Paris and Milan bourses closed at their lowest levels for 13 months while the Netherlands' AEX was down to its lowest level since December 1999. </p> <p>The telecoms sector has been undermined by worries about the size of the debt being taken on by companies in the sector because of mergers and acquisitions, and the costs of acquiring third-generation mobile phone licences and building their infrastructure. </p> <p>Shares in Vodafone, which on Monday fell below 200p for the first time in two years, lost another 9p to 190p yesterday. </p> <p>The sector's cash needs were underlined yesterday when France T\u00e9l\u00e9com announced that it was planning to raise up to $8bn through a bond issue. </p> <p>Commerzbank equity strategist Rolf Elgeti nonetheless said he remained reasonably bullish about the outlook for the UK market. </p> <p>\"We have a year-end target of 7,500 for the FTSE 100. As long as the fundamentals don't change we don't see any need to change our view of a fair value for the market. </p> <p>\"The question is what is going to happen in the meantime. There is a lot less confidence in the market. People just don't believe the earnings forecasts and projections.\" </p> <p>In London, banking shares, which have propped up the market in recent months, were undermined by fears of a price war after Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, announced it would be cutting its standard variable rate by 75 basis points. </p> <p>The move came a day after Nationwide, the mutually owned building society, announced it would be lowering its basic mortgage rate. </p> <p>Fears that the government will refer Lloyds TSB's offer for Abbey National to an in-depth competition inquiry also weighed on sentiment. </p> <p>An end to the recently solid performances from market heavyweight GlaxoSmithKline, which dropped 4% ahead of today's full-year results, removed another a central pillar of support for the FTSE 100.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets across Europe fell to their lowest levels for more than a year yesterday, with London closing below the 6,000 mark for the first time in 16 months as banking, telecom and drug stocks dragged down indices. Renewed nervousness in the telecoms sector hit index heavyweight Vodafone and the prospect of a mortgage price war weighed on the banking sector, causing the FTSE 100 share index to fall more than 100 points, closing at its lowest point since October 1999. \"It was mainly telecoms and banks, there wasn't much going on elsewhere in the market to offset that,\" said one share dealer. \"We have finally fallen back below 6,000. It should have happened before. It's just the market catching up with reality.\" A lacklustre showing from Wall Street, back in operation after Monday's holiday, also weighed on sentiment. By mid-afternoon in New York the Nasdaq index of technology shares was down 3%, extending Friday's sharp losses prompted by profits warnings from Nortel and Hewlett Packard. The Paris and Milan bourses closed at their lowest levels for 13 months while the Netherlands' AEX was down to its lowest level since December 1999. The telecoms sector has been undermined by worries about the size of the debt being taken on by companies in the sector because of mergers and acquisitions, and the costs of acquiring third-generation mobile phone licences and building their infrastructure. Shares in Vodafone, which on Monday fell below 200p for the first time in two years, lost another 9p to 190p yesterday. The sector's cash needs were underlined yesterday when France T\u00e9l\u00e9com announced that it was planning to raise up to $8bn through a bond issue. Commerzbank equity strategist Rolf Elgeti nonetheless said he remained reasonably bullish about the outlook for the UK market. \"We have a year-end target of 7,500 for the FTSE 100. As long as the fundamentals don't change we don't see any need to change our view of a fair value for the market. \"The question is what is going to happen in the meantime. There is a lot less confidence in the market. People just don't believe the earnings forecasts and projections.\" In London, banking shares, which have propped up the market in recent months, were undermined by fears of a price war after Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, announced it would be cutting its standard variable rate by 75 basis points. The move came a day after Nationwide, the mutually owned building society, announced it would be lowering its basic mortgage rate. Fears that the government will refer Lloyds TSB's offer for Abbey National to an in-depth competition inquiry also weighed on sentiment. An end to the recently solid performances from market heavyweight GlaxoSmithKline, which dropped 4% ahead of today's full-year results, removed another a central pillar of support for the FTSE 100.",

      "bodyText": "A call centre's staff were amazed and humiliated when their manager brought in disposable nappies and threatened that whoever made the most visits to the toilet would be forced to wear one. The horror story was just one of hundreds that have emerged over the past week via a TUC hotline, set up on February 12 as part of a campaign to improve conditions in call centres across Britain. Some 550 people have phoned in complaining of bullying, impossible sales targets, risible breaks between calls, and hostility to unions. But the majority have mentioned extreme pressure not to go to the toilet. \"One of the most common themes has been needing permission to go to the toilet, having to put up your hand to do so, being monitored on toilet breaks, people who are spending more time in the toilet than others being marked out and, in one particular instance, a manager taking in a box of nappies,\" said a TUC spokeswoman. The manager had made workers sign a \"toilet book\", but failed to carry out his threat of forcing them to wear nappies after a worker stood up to him.\" Call centre workers, who on average earn just \u00a312,850 - \u00a39,000 less than the national average, also told of having been threatened with the sack if they joined unions. Some were forced to go into work to report in sick, instead of being able to phone in and some were not allowed to take more than three days' consecutive leave, preventing anyone taking a proper holiday. A caller complained of being allowed a three-second break between calls, and one was accused of being \"idle\" after taking a break for six seconds. Another caller said that his boss forced people to take a monthly general knowledge quiz, disciplining them if they failed to get more than 95% three times. John Monks, TUC general secretary, said many centres treated staff with respect while others were making an effort to \"clean up\" their image. The call centre industry, which employs 400,000 people, has been blighted with a \"sweatshop\" tag. Workers stay less than 18 months on average, often leaving through the stress and tedium of the job. About 70% of them are women. The extent of dissatisfaction with the industry emerged in a survey for Bella magazine. The survey also revealed that employers in other industries were giving cash bonuses to workers to encourage them not to take sick leave - despite the risk of spreading infection to other colleagues. Ann-Marie Stagg, chair of the Call Centre Management Association, which represents 500 call centre managers, said: \"In the majority of centres, standards are very high, but there are small call centres, such as telesales teams, where you findthis level of over-supervision.\" Useful links Communication workers union Government recommendations for public-sector call centres Call Centre Focus online magazine",

But your talk of withdrawing from the Balkans is alarming. Kosovo and Serbia remain deeply unstable and we have our own troops there. It is simply not true that the US carries more than its fair share of the peacekeeping burden. Look at Britain's actions in Sierra Leone and East Timor.

This would increase American leverage when it really matters, as over Iraq now.</p> <p>\u0095 Do stop antagonising Russia unnecessarily, as you did when your guys accused Moscow the other day of being an arch-proliferator. Vlad Putin, a man I know well, is an insecure little bloke with cold war instincts. He feels threatened by NMD, the EU's and Nato's eastward expansion and your rearmament plans. He is already beginning to react aggressively. Putin needs flattery and coaxing. You'll need Russia one day, as you did when the Kosovo air campaign was getting nowhere.</p> <p>\u0095 Don't allow Ariel Sharon to destroy all the progress made in Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians. But if you don't want to lead Middle East mediation efforts, stand back and let us Europeans have a go.

      "bodyText": "Two men serving life sentences for murder launched a test case yesterday which could pave the way for the Moors murderer Myra Hindley to win her freedom. Lawyers for Anthony Anderson and John Taylor argued at the high court in London that the home secretary's role in fixing their tariff or earliest date of release is incompatible with the European convention on human rights. The two, represented by Hindley's QC, Edward Fitzgerald, invoked the Human Rights Act, which made the convention part of UK law when it came into force last October. Hindley lost her challenge to the \"whole life tariff\" set by Jack Straw, the home secretary, after a lengthy battle which ended in the House of Lords in 1999. But that was before the advent of the Human Rights Act, which has allowed new arguments to be mounted. Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, said in an interview that Mr Straw could be forced by the courts to release Hindley and other murderers against his will. He predicted judges might remove the home secretary's power to set the tariff. Mr Fitzgerald argued that allowing a politician rather than a judge to fix the tariff breached article six of the European convention, which requires sentences to be set after a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. A Home Office spokeswoman said hundreds of cases in which the home secretary had fixed a higher tariff than the minimum term recommended by judges could potentially be affected, although most of the tariffs for the country's 3,000 mandatory lifers had been set in line with judicial guidelines. All 23 murderers, including Myra Hindley, who have been told they will never be released, will be able to challenge that decision if Anderson and Taylor succeed. Mr Straw has already lost his role in setting tariffs for discretionary lifers - those serving life for crimes other than murder - and for young murderers like Jon Venables and Robert Thompson who are detained at her majesty's pleasure. Mr Fitzgerald told Lord Justice Rose, Mr Justice Sullivan and Mr Justice Penry-Davey: \"We submit that the writing is on the wall for the system _ the principal vice is simply one of principle. These are sentencing functions which should not be performed by a politician but by the judiciary.\" Anderson, 38, was convicted in 1988 of murdering Thomas Walker, 60, and Michael Tierney, a homosexual, and got two life sentences. The judge, with the agreement of the lord chief justice, recommended his tariff should be 15 years. In July 1994, the then home secretary, Michael Howard, set the minimum term Anderson must serve at 20 years, and that decision was reaffirmed by Mr Straw. The home secretary said the tariff was justified because Anderson had killed on two separate occasions. Taylor, 45 and serving life at Whitemoor prison, was convicted at Sheffield crown court in January 1989 of murdering Susan McNamara, a snooker club owner. The trial judge and the lord chief justice set his tariff at 16 years, but in March this year Mr Straw set the minimum term he should serve in prison before being considered for parole at 22 years.

      "body": "<p>Parents have to take some blame for British teenagers being near the top of international leagues in binge drinking, intoxication and experimenting with illegal drugs, researchers said yesterday.</p> <p>Three in 10 of 15- to 16-year-olds have been drunk at least 20 times in their lives, one in three have tried an illicit drug, and one in five claim they were smoking at least a cigarette a day by the time they were 13.</p> <p>The sorry tale of theUK's status for boozing and drug use was revealed in a study covering 60,000 teenagers in 30 countries.</p> <p>It also pointed to a possible explanation for the UK's love affair with alcoholic excess at the weekends. Nearly one in 10 of British youngsters questioned claimed their families did not know where they were on a Saturday night and only half said their parents always knew where they were on such evenings.</p> <p>That was worse than many European countries, including France, where seven in 10 teenagers said parents knew their whereabouts.</p> <p>The publication of the survey results from research conducted in 1999 coincides with a World Health Organisation conference in Stockholm designed to wake Europe up to its drink problems.</p> <p>Retailers and publicans were criticised for turning a blind eye to substantial sales of drink and tobacco to under-age buyers. Martin Plant, director of the alcohol and health research centre, Edinburgh, and coordinator of the UK part of survey, said the high tobacco use posed the greatest and most lasting risk to health.</p> <p>\"If boys and girls are raised in families where smoking or drinking or misuses of prescribed medication or illicit drugs is taking place, they are going to think it is normal _ Parents are clearly influential.\"</p> <p>He said French parents seemed to communicate more with their children. \"That suggests to me French parents may be better at establishing or delineating some kind of boundaries for what is acceptable for their teenagers.\"</p> <p>His colleague Patrick Miller said there was a link between alcohol, drug and tobacco misuse and whether parents knew where their children were. Single parents \"mostly strive to do a very good job\" but there were indications that children from lone parent families in the UK, where mothers or fathers were generally poorer and more likely to be unemployed than in Europe, were also more prone to misuse.</p> <p><b> Cultural changes</b><br></p> <p>The researchers pointed out that adult drinking cultures had changed rapidly in some parts of Europe with big falls in France and Italy but soaring consumption in eastern states.</p> <p>The results showed that 20% of the UK teenagers said they had smoked at least a cigarette a day when they were 13 or younger - although their lifetime consumption by 16 put this country 20th in the table, one of its more \"healthy\" results.</p> <p>But young people in the UK vied with those in Denmark , Ireland and Poland to be the young heavy drinking \"champions\" of Europe. A third of boys and more than a quarter of girls said they had been drunk at least 20 times in their lives.</p> <p>Their experience of other drugs was also more widespread than young people in other countries, although French teenagers had used cannabis more often recently.</p> <p>There were strong indications that drug use was falling, including that of ecstasy, perhaps as a result of widely-publicised tragic consequences.</p> <p>Dr Plant said policy must take account of the fact that 120,000 people a year died prematurely in the UK from smoking-related diseases, against up to 35,000 from alcohol and 1,200 from illicit drug taking. \"The prime minister suggested we should set up a UK register for people dealing hard drugs _ that register should include a tobacconist who sells to 13-year-olds, because tobacco kills a higher proportion of regular users than any other drug. The le gal age for alcohol purchase is 18. With tobacco, the most dangerous drug on the planet, it would be better if the age was raised from 16 to 18, to 21, or 50.\"</p> <p>Dr Plant added: \"We are getting the extreme consequences of the centuries-old tradition of concentrating our drinking around weekends.

      "bodyText": "Parents have to take some blame for British teenagers being near the top of international leagues in binge drinking, intoxication and experimenting with illegal drugs, researchers said yesterday. Three in 10 of 15- to 16-year-olds have been drunk at least 20 times in their lives, one in three have tried an illicit drug, and one in five claim they were smoking at least a cigarette a day by the time they were 13. The sorry tale of theUK's status for boozing and drug use was revealed in a study covering 60,000 teenagers in 30 countries. It also pointed to a possible explanation for the UK's love affair with alcoholic excess at the weekends. Nearly one in 10 of British youngsters questioned claimed their families did not know where they were on a Saturday night and only half said their parents always knew where they were on such evenings. That was worse than many European countries, including France, where seven in 10 teenagers said parents knew their whereabouts. The publication of the survey results from research conducted in 1999 coincides with a World Health Organisation conference in Stockholm designed to wake Europe up to its drink problems. Retailers and publicans were criticised for turning a blind eye to substantial sales of drink and tobacco to under-age buyers. Martin Plant, director of the alcohol and health research centre, Edinburgh, and coordinator of the UK part of survey, said the high tobacco use posed the greatest and most lasting risk to health. \"If boys and girls are raised in families where smoking or drinking or misuses of prescribed medication or illicit drugs is taking place, they are going to think it is normal _ Parents are clearly influential.\" He said French parents seemed to communicate more with their children. \"That suggests to me French parents may be better at establishing or delineating some kind of boundaries for what is acceptable for their teenagers.\" His colleague Patrick Miller said there was a link between alcohol, drug and tobacco misuse and whether parents knew where their children were. Single parents \"mostly strive to do a very good job\" but there were indications that children from lone parent families in the UK, where mothers or fathers were generally poorer and more likely to be unemployed than in Europe, were also more prone to misuse. Cultural changes The researchers pointed out that adult drinking cultures had changed rapidly in some parts of Europe with big falls in France and Italy but soaring consumption in eastern states. The results showed that 20% of the UK teenagers said they had smoked at least a cigarette a day when they were 13 or younger - although their lifetime consumption by 16 put this country 20th in the table, one of its more \"healthy\" results. But young people in the UK vied with those in Denmark , Ireland and Poland to be the young heavy drinking \"champions\" of Europe. A third of boys and more than a quarter of girls said they had been drunk at least 20 times in their lives. Their experience of other drugs was also more widespread than young people in other countries, although French teenagers had used cannabis more often recently. There were strong indications that drug use was falling, including that of ecstasy, perhaps as a result of widely-publicised tragic consequences. Dr Plant said policy must take account of the fact that 120,000 people a year died prematurely in the UK from smoking-related diseases, against up to 35,000 from alcohol and 1,200 from illicit drug taking. \"The prime minister suggested we should set up a UK register for people dealing hard drugs _ that register should include a tobacconist who sells to 13-year-olds, because tobacco kills a higher proportion of regular users than any other drug. The le gal age for alcohol purchase is 18. With tobacco, the most dangerous drug on the planet, it would be better if the age was raised from 16 to 18, to 21, or 50.\" Dr Plant added: \"We are getting the extreme consequences of the centuries-old tradition of concentrating our drinking around weekends. Teenagers have adopted this behaviour at young ages.\" Wider issue Existing rules, including those forbidding sale of drink to people already intoxicated, should be more widely enforced, he said. More flexibility of licensed drinking hours in England and Wales might help, as it had in Scotland. \"If you have too many controls, you could drive things underground.\" Paul Boateng, minister for children and young people, said: \"This study raises a wider issue of rights and responsibilities in society today. Our drive to improve standards in education, reform the youth justice system and the New Deal for the young unemployed are helping to ensure that young people are encouraged to take greater responsibility for themselves and others, as well as providing better work and social opportunities. \"But this cannot just be a matter for government. Encouraging more responsible behaviour amongst the young is a matter for us all - parents, teachers, friends and communities.\" Another report by Paul Willner, director for the centre for substance abuse research at the University of Wales, Swansea, suggested that huge numbers of 16-year-olds, and girls as young as 13, were buying alcohol, and that retailers, including supermarkets, were making little attempt to check their age.

Patrolling US and British aircraft have flown more than 16,000 sorties in the past four years alone and have frequently attacked Iraqi anti-aircraft systems on the ground. Apart from the financial cost (Britain has spent \u00a3800m), accidental civilian casualties have played into Iraq's hands by discrediting the policy - though western sources say Iraq's claim of 300 deaths is exaggerated. Iraq's military aircraft are barred from operating in the no-fly zones, but in November Iraq complicated the situation by resuming civilian flights into the zones: from Baghdad to Basra in the south and Mosul in the north. \u0095 Weapons inspections Since the Gulf war Iraq has played a cat-and-mouse game over inspections of its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programmes.

But their wonders, he believes, have limits. \"Women's work is to create life, nurture life and protect life. Mother love is the strongest of all human emotions, and is indeed the basis of civilisation.\"</p> <p>Major John Cann from Ascot agrees. In a letter published the same day he argues: \"In the majority of the animal world the male species protects the female species, and in the army in the frontline this is bound to apply.\"</p> <p>For those of us who are incapable of living our lives according to the laws of nature there is still hope, writes John Capel from Usk, on the subject of \"homosexual temptations\". \"For Christians,\" he writes, \"the important distinction is whether or not the individual is acknowledging the weaknesses, repenting of the failures and seeking to amend.\"</p> <p>Writing to the Telegraph after shadow chancellor, Francis Maude, suggested the Tories might one day have a gay leader, he states: \"Of course the liberal intelligentsia claim 'being gay' is not wrong, but most of us know that it is.\"</p> <p>Just below, Pastor Ken Slater is preparing the stable boys for the four horsemen of the apocalypse. After a quote from The Revelation of St John the Divine comes the omen: \"Sexual deviation is a mark on the spiritual barometer which indicates that stormy days are ahead.\"</p> <p>Britain, according to the Telegraph letters page, is indeed a scary place. When it comes to gender politics and sexual orientation its postbag reads like an unholy alliance between Eminem and the squires from the shires.</p> <p>To be fair there is occasional dissent - the day after the page had been transformed into a homophobic pamphlet, there were several pleas for sanity. But for the most part it is a land where men are chaps, women are ladies and Maude is a liberal. It is as though the past 50 years never happened. Like an afternoon watching reruns on UK Gold, you are left with the peculiar sense that the past and the present run not consecutively but concurrently.</p> <p>Confined to the Telegraph letters page all of this would represent little more than an everyday tale of ordinary, rightwing, letter-writing folk - a group of people for whom, like their leftwing counterparts, conviction and obsession are close bedfellows. But it does not stop there. These views are a fairly accurate reflection not only of Telegraph readers but Tory leaders. It is an expression of impotent rage that the world is not how it should be with no accompanying notion of how it might be improved.</p> <p>They hate the Macpherson report, but have no suggestions for restoring confidence in policing; they revile the Northern Ireland peace process, but offer no alternative. They not only mythologise the past and loathe the present but refuse to even contemplate the future.</p> <p>It is a mindset which Hague at first appeared keen to challenge.

      "bodyText": "Rear Admiral Sir Morgan Morgan-Giles sounds like a rum old chap. \"Women are wonderful,\" he says, writing on the prospect of female soldiers fighting on the frontline in a missive to the Telegraph from his home in Little Sodbury. But their wonders, he believes, have limits. \"Women's work is to create life, nurture life and protect life. Mother love is the strongest of all human emotions, and is indeed the basis of civilisation.\" Major John Cann from Ascot agrees. In a letter published the same day he argues: \"In the majority of the animal world the male species protects the female species, and in the army in the frontline this is bound to apply.\" For those of us who are incapable of living our lives according to the laws of nature there is still hope, writes John Capel from Usk, on the subject of \"homosexual temptations\". \"For Christians,\" he writes, \"the important distinction is whether or not the individual is acknowledging the weaknesses, repenting of the failures and seeking to amend.\" Writing to the Telegraph after shadow chancellor, Francis Maude, suggested the Tories might one day have a gay leader, he states: \"Of course the liberal intelligentsia claim 'being gay' is not wrong, but most of us know that it is.\" Just below, Pastor Ken Slater is preparing the stable boys for the four horsemen of the apocalypse. After a quote from The Revelation of St John the Divine comes the omen: \"Sexual deviation is a mark on the spiritual barometer which indicates that stormy days are ahead.\" Britain, according to the Telegraph letters page, is indeed a scary place. When it comes to gender politics and sexual orientation its postbag reads like an unholy alliance between Eminem and the squires from the shires. To be fair there is occasional dissent - the day after the page had been transformed into a homophobic pamphlet, there were several pleas for sanity. But for the most part it is a land where men are chaps, women are ladies and Maude is a liberal. It is as though the past 50 years never happened. Like an afternoon watching reruns on UK Gold, you are left with the peculiar sense that the past and the present run not consecutively but concurrently. Confined to the Telegraph letters page all of this would represent little more than an everyday tale of ordinary, rightwing, letter-writing folk - a group of people for whom, like their leftwing counterparts, conviction and obsession are close bedfellows. But it does not stop there. These views are a fairly accurate reflection not only of Telegraph readers but Tory leaders. It is an expression of impotent rage that the world is not how it should be with no accompanying notion of how it might be improved. They hate the Macpherson report, but have no suggestions for restoring confidence in policing; they revile the Northern Ireland peace process, but offer no alternative. They not only mythologise the past and loathe the present but refuse to even contemplate the future. It is a mindset which Hague at first appeared keen to challenge. His appearance at Notting Hill carnival in his baseball cap was the first sign, albeit a cheesy one, that he wanted to shift the perception, if not the direction, of his party. He spoke of \"compassion\" and \"inclusivity\", brought gay, Eurosceptic businessman Ivan Massow into the spotlight, and looked forward to a time when his party would have a black or Asian leader.

They look at yesterday's Guardian/ICM poll and see a lead stretching into the distance: a 15-point margin at a time when most governments are lucky to be in the low single digits.</p> <p>Or they can glance at the \"poll of polls\" produced by that veteran number-cruncher, Ivor Crewe. His latest average of the competing surveys shows Labour with an even fatter 17-point lead - enough to swell Labour's majority from 179 seats to 229.</p> <p>The Millbankers can slice it whichever way they like, it's still the same story. Labour are more trusted than the Conservatives to handle education, health and transport - and even traditional Tory strong suits like the economy and law and order. On every measure, they win. No postwar government has enjoyed a command like it; even Margaret Thatcher's post-Falklands surge in 1983 was not as strong.</p> <p>The private polling, where Labour might tell itself some unwelcome truths, is just as encouraging. Voters still associate the Tories with the bad old days of the early 90s - sky-high interest rates, repossessions, negative equity. Black Wednesday has become the Tories' Winter of Discontent: Labour only has to mention it to scare voters on to their side. Reporters may be bored rigid by hearing Gordon Brown chant \"No return to boom and bust\", but the polls show it works. Yesterday the Halifax did their bit to help, too: their cut in base rates, and the general price war in the mortgage business, all add to the pre-election, feelgood mood.</p> <p>As if Labour's advantage was not great enough already, it has two more weapons at the ready. First, the Millbank crew have had a recent lesson in how not to do it. They watched Al Gore's narrow defeat last year, realising that even a party presiding over economic good times can lose. Gore's mistake, they concluded, was to treat America's prosperity as a given, thereby denying the Democrats credit for their achievement. That's why the Blairite soundbite du jour is that Britain's economic health - record lows in both inflation and unemployment - is the fruit of \"choice, not chance\". Labour refuses to let this election become a debate with the Tories on how to spend it - they want credit for generating the surplus cash in the first place. And, so far, they're getting it.</p> <p>Labour's second nuclear device is William Hague. Polls show the British have warmed to him about as much as they did to Neil Kinnock: they simply do not see him as a plausible prime minister. Indeed, Blair's personal lead over Hague is a whopping 20 points.</p> <p>No blot, it seems, can muddy this landscape. The Tory boomlet of September's fuel protests went as fast as it came. Peter Mandelson's resignation excited the natterers and chatterers of the Westminster village but made no dent on the polls. The Derry Irvine, cash-for-wigs affair adds to the widespread impression of an arrogant Labour administration - but it seems unlikely to shift many votes. Tony Blair must reckon that his is the Teflon government: both the Mandy and Derry episodes would have unravelled John Major, but they seem to wash right off him.</p> <p>Can anything darken this blue sky for Labour? Only one thing: turnout. If Labour's supporters stay at home, confident that victory is theirs, and Conservatives head out, energised by their determination to keep the pound, a gap that should have been a mile-wide could suddenly narrow. That's why Blair's last two big speeches were so blatantly aimed at waking up and motivating Labour voters.</p> <p>In this context there are a couple of distant clouds which, even if they don't threaten to ruin Labour's spring day, could certainly cause the odd unwanted shower. The irony is that both are of the government's own making. Indeed, the source of the trouble is one of Labour's most radical first-term achievements: devolution.</p> <p>I t is in Wales that the problem is most obvious. Labour figures there warn that the party could lose between seven and 10 of the 34 Welsh seats they now hold. They cite the 1999 elections for the new Welsh assembly, when Labour lost the iconic strongholds of the Rhondda, Islwyn (Kinnock's old seat) and Llanelli.</p> <p>The explanation is simple. \"You ask people here what they would prefer to have, the national assembly or bubonic plague, and most of them would opt for the latter,\" says one Labour sceptic. He believes the government is now blamed for creating a body - following the narrowest of referendum victories in 1997 - which nobody wants. One recent poll found two-thirds of Welsh voters disapproved of the assembly, with Labour taking the rap. A recent council byelection in Wrexham saw Labour's total vote slump to just 50 - in a seat where its previous majority had been 654.</p> <p>Activists are still smarting over the Alun Michael episode - when Millbank sought to impose its own man as Welsh Labour leader over the people's choice, Rhodri Morgan -and have struggled to recover ever since. Now installed as first minister, Morgan has missed the odd political trick, too: he let himself announce the Corus steel closure in Llanwern, but allowed one of his Liberal Democrat coalition partners to get the glory of revealing that the FA Cup was coming to Cardiff. \"Naff politics,\" sniffs one critic. Punishment could come on polling day, when Welsh voters either defect to Plaid Cymru again - or stay home.</p> <p>In Scotland, Labour has the reverse problem - not that devolution has failed to bed down, but that it has bedded down too comfortably. While the Welsh still doubt the purpose of their assembly, Scots have grown entirely used to their new parliament in Edinburgh: \"It's as if it was always there,\" says one fulltime observer.</p> <p>The result is that a general election for Westminster could feel a very faraway affair. Now that so many key decisions are taken at Holyrood, Labour will have an uphill struggle explaining why the coming poll is even relevant to Scotland. After all, the key Blair themes - education, health and crime - are no longer decided in Westminster at all, but in Edinburgh. If anything, the new dispensation helps the Tories: at least their core issues - Europe and asylum, for example - remain Westminster matters. The one crumb of comfort for Labour is that if the remoteness of the House of Commons hurts them, imagine what it does to the Scottish National party: how on earth will they get their vote out?</p> <p>For wholly opposite reasons - the success of devolution in Scotland, its struggle to take root in Wales - two Labour bastions threaten to spoil the party this spring. It won't be enough to change the final outcome, but it could alter the scale of victory. Any of those Millbank workers, about to place their bet in the office sweepstake, take note.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

As if Labour's advantage was not great enough already, it has two more weapons at the ready. First, the Millbank crew have had a recent lesson in how not to do it. They watched Al Gore's narrow defeat last year, realising that even a party presiding over economic good times can lose. Gore's mistake, they concluded, was to treat America's prosperity as a given, thereby denying the Democrats credit for their achievement. That's why the Blairite soundbite du jour is that Britain's economic health - record lows in both inflation and unemployment - is the fruit of \"choice, not chance\". Labour refuses to let this election become a debate with the Tories on how to spend it - they want credit for generating the surplus cash in the first place. And, so far, they're getting it. Labour's second nuclear device is William Hague. Polls show the British have warmed to him about as much as they did to Neil Kinnock: they simply do not see him as a plausible prime minister. Indeed, Blair's personal lead over Hague is a whopping 20 points. No blot, it seems, can muddy this landscape. The Tory boomlet of September's fuel protests went as fast as it came. Peter Mandelson's resignation excited the natterers and chatterers of the Westminster village but made no dent on the polls. The Derry Irvine, cash-for-wigs affair adds to the widespread impression of an arrogant Labour administration - but it seems unlikely to shift many votes. Tony Blair must reckon that his is the Teflon government: both the Mandy and Derry episodes would have unravelled John Major, but they seem to wash right off him. Can anything darken this blue sky for Labour? Only one thing: turnout. If Labour's supporters stay at home, confident that victory is theirs, and Conservatives head out, energised by their determination to keep the pound, a gap that should have been a mile-wide could suddenly narrow. That's why Blair's last two big speeches were so blatantly aimed at waking up and motivating Labour voters. In this context there are a couple of distant clouds which, even if they don't threaten to ruin Labour's spring day, could certainly cause the odd unwanted shower. The irony is that both are of the government's own making. Indeed, the source of the trouble is one of Labour's most radical first-term achievements: devolution. I t is in Wales that the problem is most obvious. Labour figures there warn that the party could lose between seven and 10 of the 34 Welsh seats they now hold. They cite the 1999 elections for the new Welsh assembly, when Labour lost the iconic strongholds of the Rhondda, Islwyn (Kinnock's old seat) and Llanelli. The explanation is simple. \"You ask people here what they would prefer to have, the national assembly or bubonic plague, and most of them would opt for the latter,\" says one Labour sceptic. He believes the government is now blamed for creating a body - following the narrowest of referendum victories in 1997 - which nobody wants. One recent poll found two-thirds of Welsh voters disapproved of the assembly, with Labour taking the rap. A recent council byelection in Wrexham saw Labour's total vote slump to just 50 - in a seat where its previous majority had been 654. Activists are still smarting over the Alun Michael episode - when Millbank sought to impose its own man as Welsh Labour leader over the people's choice, Rhodri Morgan -and have struggled to recover ever since. Now installed as first minister, Morgan has missed the odd political trick, too: he let himself announce the Corus steel closure in Llanwern, but allowed one of his Liberal Democrat coalition partners to get the glory of revealing that the FA Cup was coming to Cardiff. \"Naff politics,\" sniffs one critic. Punishment could come on polling day, when Welsh voters either defect to Plaid Cymru again - or stay home. In Scotland, Labour has the reverse problem - not that devolution has failed to bed down, but that it has bedded down too comfortably. While the Welsh still doubt the purpose of their assembly, Scots have grown entirely used to their new parliament in Edinburgh: \"It's as if it was always there,\" says one fulltime observer. The result is that a general election for Westminster could feel a very faraway affair. Now that so many key decisions are taken at Holyrood, Labour will have an uphill struggle explaining why the coming poll is even relevant to Scotland. After all, the key Blair themes - education, health and crime - are no longer decided in Westminster at all, but in Edinburgh. If anything, the new dispensation helps the Tories: at least their core issues - Europe and asylum, for example - remain Westminster matters. The one crumb of comfort for Labour is that if the remoteness of the House of Commons hurts them, imagine what it does to the Scottish National party: how on earth will they get their vote out? For wholly opposite reasons - the success of devolution in Scotland, its struggle to take root in Wales - two Labour bastions threaten to spoil the party this spring. It won't be enough to change the final outcome, but it could alter the scale of victory. Any of those Millbank workers, about to place their bet in the office sweepstake, take note. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>When Josephine Baker was eight, she worked for a white woman who plunged Baker's hands into boiling water because she used too much soap in the wash. In her native St Louis, she witnessed terrifying race riots in 1917 that left 39 black people dead and thousands homeless. She had a better time in France. In her first two years in Paris she received 46,000 fan letters and 2,000 marriage proposals. </p> <p>The singer and dancer sailed for France in 1925, when she was 19. In Paris, Baker joined the cast of the Revue N\u00e8gre, a song and dance troupe put together by a bored American diplomat's wife. Baker drove Paris wild. But then she would, wouldn't she? She danced bare-breasted, often wore a belt of bananas and had a rear end that wiggled at least 120 times per minute. </p> <p>\"Eroticism has found a style,\" wrote Jean Cocteau. Erich Maria Remarque, author of All Quiet on the Western Front, wrote that Baker \"brought a whiff of jungle air and an elemental strength and beauty to the tired showplace of western civilisation\". </p> <p>When she returned to the States in the 1930s, having established herself as France's leading variety artist and contributed enormously to the popularity of jazz in Europe, Baker was ridiculed because of her reedy, high-pitched voice. In France she lived in a chateau in the Dordogne; in the US she was refused a hotel room because she was black. </p> <p>The 1920s Revue N\u00e8gre started a craze in Paris for things black and American, especially jazz. It has been a long love affair, commemorated in the release this week of 50 remastered CDs by Universal Records, which include everything from Django Reinhardt, St\u00e9phane Grappelli and the rest of the Quintette du Hot Club de France playing Limehouse Blues, to Toots Thielemans's Blues Pour Flirter, as well as lots of wonderful Oscar Peterson, Zoot Sims and Lucky Thompson, all of it recorded in Paris between the 1930s and the late 1970s. Above all, it gives us a chance to savour that now-distant time when Saint Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s swung and many a black-turtle necked existentialist knew more about the discography of the musician on stage than the musician himself. </p> <p>But Paris's jazz craze could have been nipped in the bud. In the 1920s the authorities decided to impose quotas: half the members of every band had to be French nationals, a rule that would have made Parisian jazz desperately insipid. Fortunately, the Americans got round that by having French musicians sitting in the band doing nothing more than hold their instruments. </p> <p>During this time, a young clarinettist from New Orleans called Sidney Bechet arrived in Paris for the first time. He joined a band led by Claude Hopkins, taking part in a show featuring Josephine Baker. It all went well until 1929, when he had an argument with a banjo player. They ended up trading gunshots, three people were wounded and Bechet was jailed for a year before being deported. </p> <p>But, as they had done with Baker, the French clasped Bechet to their bosom. The authorities managed to \"lose\" the evidence of Bechet's deportation order, and so, after the war, he was able to settle in Paris for good. One American visitor wrote: \"Sidney could have become mayor of Paris if he wanted to. Crowds of people followed him through the streets. I was never so surprised in my whole life as when I discovered that a compatriot, whom I had barely heard of, had become the darling of the French.\" </p> <p>The French called Bechet \"le dieu\" and after he died in 1959 the seaside town of Juan-les-Pins, where he had one of his two mansions, erected a statute to him. </p> <p>Bechet installed himself in Paris at the right time. The city had just been liberated and jazz in France was just about to come of age. In the aftermath of the second world war jazz clubs spread quickly around Saint Germain. Near the church of St Julien-le-Pauvre the Trois Mailletz club opened in a cellar complete with gothic arches. The Chat Qui Peche club saw Donald Byrd's bebop quintet play regularly, and Jean-Luc Ponty and Eddy Louiss started their careers there. There was jazz and dancing at the Tabou. In most Left Bank clubs, though, there was no dancing, just a great deal of chin-scratching contemplation. </p> <p>There's a lovely photograph of the Donald Byrd Quintet in some tiny Left Bank club in the mid-1950s. They're probably halfway through a skittering reading of Salt Peanuts or an achingly slow take on Stardust. Bobby Jaspar is playing the tenor solo, with Walter Davis Jr on an upright jammed against the wall. Doug Watkins is on bass and somehow Art Taylor has managed to get his drum kit into this little cellar. In the foreground, the last word in cool in a sharp suit, Byrd stands with his eyes closed. He's taking a last drag before picking up his trumpet to play the theme. </p> <p>Crammed around them in this tiny room are lots of studious white Parisians in jackets and ties. One man in particular draws one's attention. He's standing against a pillar with his head tilted down and thus repeating the posture and extreme concentration of Doug Watkins. Jazz - it's as serious as life, you know. </p> <p>In an article called Jazz 1947 Jean-Paul Sartre wrote wrote gnomically: \"Jazz music is like bananas; you eat them on the spot.\" He added that French musicians were \"melancholy imitators\". But this notion became less true as time went on. In the 1920s Paris could only listen to this new-found art form. But in the 1930s, Reinhardt and Grappelli showed the way. Over the next two decades Paris produced an increasing number of original musicians who thrived in Saint Germain - Guy Lafitte, Pierre Michelot, Guy Pederson, Henri Renaud and Jean-Luc Ponty. </p> <p>\"Saint Germain did for music what Montparnasse did for painting after 1918. And it wasn't just any kind of music, it was jazz,\" said Renaud. For a while jazz was everywhere in Paris. Everybody had copies of Sidney Bechet's huge hits, Petite Fleur and Oignons. His lavish Riviera wedding was shown on newsreels. At the Olympia theatre, Louis Armstrong, Erroll Garner and the band from the Club St Germain appeared on the same bill as Juliette Greco. </p> <p>Despite the rise of French musicians, Americans dominated Paris jazz in the 1960s. Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Chet Baker, Peanuts Holland, Lucky Thompson and Zoot Sims played long residencies, while Kenny Clarke and Bill Coleman were virtually permanent fixtures. </p> <p>What drew them to Paris? Scott Fitzgerald put it this way: \"There is no second act in an American's life.\" Especially if you're a jazz musician. But in France it was and is different: the French love their jazz so much that they give musicians not only second acts, but third, fourth and fifth acts, as well as generous state subsidies and the occasional statue. </p> <p>In France they look after jazz talent long after it has passed its American sell-by date. Consider Chet Baker. In 1952 this good-looking trumpeter was top of the Billboard charts, but his drug addiction put paid to that. His pretty-boy looks became spectacularly craggy, and his popularity waned. In the mid 1950s he arrived in Paris and immediately took Saint Germain by storm. Though he was strung out on drugs for much of the time, he kept up an intense and gloomy relationship with the city for the next three decades. </p> <p>And Paris gave Baker not just a second act, but an unexpected final one, too. He returned to France in 1975, where he started to play and record extensively. There was a renewed assurance and heartfelt lyricism in both his playing and his singing. Universal has just re-released an album he cut in Paris on the afternoon of December 28 1978, at the instigation of one of his most loyal friends and admirers, Gilles Gautherin. It's called Broken Wing and, if you can quickly acquire a taste for his singing (not everybody can), it's a wonderfully tender album, as good as anything he ever did - especially the track called Blue Gilles, written in honour of the Frenchman who helped him thrive anew. </p> <p>But that story, of the ageing American jazz musician helped by some French enthusiast, is a classic of Parisian jazz. It's told in Bertrand Tavernier's 1986 film Round Midnight, in which a lanky, ageing black tenor sax player (played uncannily by lanky, ageing black tenor player Dexter Gordon) is befriended by a small white jazz buff. The once-great musician has been booked at the Blue Note but seems to be over the hill. Now he's just a guy struggling to work and to overcome a drink problem. </p> <p>The Parisian hasn't enough money to pay for admission to the club to hear his beloved musician play. But he loves jazz so much that he borrows some money from his wife to buy a flat where the tenor player can stay and rebuild his life. And it works: the American stops drinking and starts composing again. \"You treat me like a king,\" says American to Frenchman. But will it last when he is back in New York and his old environment - without his French friend to nurture him? Probably not. </p> <p>Paris is no longer head over heels in love with jazz. Now it's mostly for nostalgics or tourists, though some good gigs remain. The international stars play at New Morning, and the Jazz Club Lionel Hampton, named after the francophile wizard of the vibraphone, still thrives in the Meridien hotel. Even on the Left Bank, some clubs cling on amid the couturiers' boutiques. Le Petit Journal St-Michel and La Villa on Rue Jacob struggle to keep afloat amid high rents. Bilboquet, a Saint Germain club that opened in 1947 and was a haven of cool jazz in the 1950s, now relies largely on tourists. </p> <p>But Paris is still a haven for black jazz musicians from the States. The American jazz singer Dee Dee Bridgewater is virtually unknown in her homeland but since 1983 has flourished in France. \"I had stopped doing jazz in the US,\" she recalls. \"There wasn't a market for it, so I wound up doing pop. But I found in Europe there was a huge market for standard jazz. </p> <p>\"I went to Paris to work. I was hired to sing in Sophisticated Lady as the lead. The show was a big hit. Then I started getting concert work, which floored me because in the US without a big record company behind you you only get club dates. I started playing small theatres and my reputation grew and then the festivals kicked in. I arrived in November 1983 and I stayed.\" </p> <p>Why? \"Because I loved it and because I met a Frenchman and fell in love.\" Now, like Josephine Baker and Sidney Bechet before her, Dee Dee Bridgewater is a French national icon. It's her second act, and she doesn't want it to end any time soon. </p> <p>\"France allowed me to grow as an artist. I have been able to do just about anything that I wanted to do. That's really, really cool. As soon as I get on to the plane going to France I get real good treatment in first class. And I always get people asking why. And I have to tell them, 'Baby, you gotta realise one thing. I'm a big star in France.' \" </p> <p>\u0095 The Jazz in Paris CD series is available now from Universal Jazz.</p>",

It's told in Bertrand Tavernier's 1986 film Round Midnight, in which a lanky, ageing black tenor sax player (played uncannily by lanky, ageing black tenor player Dexter Gordon) is befriended by a small white jazz buff. The once-great musician has been booked at the Blue Note but seems to be over the hill. Now he's just a guy struggling to work and to overcome a drink problem. The Parisian hasn't enough money to pay for admission to the club to hear his beloved musician play. But he loves jazz so much that he borrows some money from his wife to buy a flat where the tenor player can stay and rebuild his life. And it works: the American stops drinking and starts composing again. \"You treat me like a king,\" says American to Frenchman. But will it last when he is back in New York and his old environment - without his French friend to nurture him? Probably not. Paris is no longer head over heels in love with jazz. Now it's mostly for nostalgics or tourists, though some good gigs remain. The international stars play at New Morning, and the Jazz Club Lionel Hampton, named after the francophile wizard of the vibraphone, still thrives in the Meridien hotel. Even on the Left Bank, some clubs cling on amid the couturiers' boutiques. Le Petit Journal St-Michel and La Villa on Rue Jacob struggle to keep afloat amid high rents. Bilboquet, a Saint Germain club that opened in 1947 and was a haven of cool jazz in the 1950s, now relies largely on tourists. But Paris is still a haven for black jazz musicians from the States. The American jazz singer Dee Dee Bridgewater is virtually unknown in her homeland but since 1983 has flourished in France. \"I had stopped doing jazz in the US,\" she recalls. \"There wasn't a market for it, so I wound up doing pop. But I found in Europe there was a huge market for standard jazz. \"I went to Paris to work. I was hired to sing in Sophisticated Lady as the lead. The show was a big hit. Then I started getting concert work, which floored me because in the US without a big record company behind you you only get club dates. I started playing small theatres and my reputation grew and then the festivals kicked in. I arrived in November 1983 and I stayed.\" Why? \"Because I loved it and because I met a Frenchman and fell in love.\" Now, like Josephine Baker and Sidney Bechet before her, Dee Dee Bridgewater is a French national icon. It's her second act, and she doesn't want it to end any time soon. \"France allowed me to grow as an artist. I have been able to do just about anything that I wanted to do. That's really, really cool. As soon as I get on to the plane going to France I get real good treatment in first class. And I always get people asking why. And I have to tell them, 'Baby, you gotta realise one thing. I'm a big star in France.' \" \u0095 The Jazz in Paris CD series is available now from Universal Jazz.",

      "bodyText": "An international mediator has warned of dire consequences for the Orange Order if it keeps refusing to talk to Northern Ireland's independent parades commission, and residents who object to some of their marches going through Catholic areas. The South African lawyer Brian Currin, who had been brought in as an impartial negotiator last year to try to sort out the controversial Drumcree dispute, told the order that its present stance, coupled with the UK's new human rights laws, meant it had virtually no chance of winning any court battle to parade down the mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road in Portadown, Co Armagh. Only a handful of the 3,000 or so Protestant loyal order marches held in the province every year are contentious. Drumcree, where Orangemen have been banned from an annual July parade down the Garvaghy Road for the past three years, has become the focal point for protest. There was wide-scale disorder when a march was forced down in 1997, and a multi-million-pound police and army operation is put in place every year. A solution is needed soon because Portadown is in the heart of the Upper Bann constituency - that of the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble - and the issue is sure to become more heated and difficult to resolve as the general election looms. Mr Currin insisted that he was not taking sides nor advocating what action Orangemen should take. He said that he merely wanted to advise them of the legal and practical implications of their decisions in a paper he gave to their leaders. In the document, he claimed the future of Orange marches in Northern Ireland was in the balance and cooperation with the parades commission, the autonomous body set up by government to arbitrate on contested routes, was the key to preserving this element of cultural diversity. \"If that key is thrown away, the consequences for Orangism, its culture and traditions, will be dire,\" he said. Regular protests are held at Drumcree, including one last week, when nationalists claimed masked men were present, which was denied by the organisers. There are fears of demonstrations being hijacked by loyalist paramilitaries. A leading Ulster Defence Association figure, Johnny Adair, now back in prison, was a frequent visitor last July.

      "bodyText": "The Kremlin yesterday moved to undermine the US administration's national missile defence plan when President Vladimir Putin presented Nato with a scaled-down \"non-strategic\" plan to protect Europe against the alleged threat of missile attack from so-called rogue states. Mr Putin coupled his initiative, which appears to be aimed at driving a wedge between the US and its European allies, with strong criticism of President George Bush's new administration, accusing hardliners in Washington of viewing Russia as \"the evil empire\". The Putin gambit came during a visit to Moscow by the Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson, aimed at healing the rift with Russia caused by the Kosovo war in 1999, when Moscow suspended relations with the alliance. But the current war of words between Moscow and Washington, the US and British bombing of Iraq at the week end, President Bush's apparent determination to pursue the\"Son of Star Wars\" plan, and the possible expansion of Nato in eastern Europe are sources of growing friction. Senior Russian officials are threatening to abandon all UN sanctions against Baghdad, the Kremlin is warning of a renewed arms race if the Americans go ahead with its missile defence system (NMD) and the Russian military is talking of retaliatory nuclear deployments if Nato takes in the Baltic states on Russia's borders. The Russian defence minister, Igor Sergeyev, outlined the three-stage Russian anti-ballistic missile proposals to Lord Robertson. Nato officials are to examine the plan in Brussels before Russian officers arrive at Nato headquarters to flesh out the plan. \"Our experts are ready to travel to Brussels to explain all the issues, including, and this is important, explaining the Russian proposals to the European public,\" Mr Putin said. The plan would entail the deployment of missiles close to potentially threatening sites to shoot down any rogue missiles shortly after launch. It would be cheaper than the $60bnUS project and \"non-strategic\", meaning that it would not violate the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. The Russians have generally denied US arguments that there is a missile threat from rogue states and are convinced that the US plan is aimed at securing unilateral strategic invulnerability. The Americans are likely to cite yesterday's proposals as evidence that the Russians acknowledge that there is a rogue missile threat. Lord Robertson said as much yesterday. \"What is important now is that we have a Russian proposal to deal with the same kind of perceived threat,\" he said. Marshal Sergeyev described any further Nato expansion as \"the most painful issue for Russia\" and warned that Nato membership for the former Soviet republics of Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia would be \"a direct threat to Russia's security\". \"For the moment we agreed to disagree,\" Lord Robertson said after the Kremlin meeting with Mr Putin. He said that no decision on further expansion would be taken until next year. But while Lord Robertson described Russia as Nato's \"partner\", the new Pentagon chief, Donald Rumsfeld, last week described Russia as a \"problem\", and Condoleezza Rice, the US national security adviser, dubbed it a \"threat\" to the west. In an interview with a French newspaper, Ms Rice said: \"I sincerely believe that Russia constitutes a threat for the west in general and our European allies in particular.\" In an apparent reference to Ms Rice's interview, Mr Putin said yesterday: \"We are aware of the statements made by certain representatives of the west - we can read - who are trying to recreate the image of Russia as the evil empire.\"",

      "bodyText": "A British Airways pilot was burned by a massive electrical shock after his plane carrying 158 people was struck by lightning. The incident, described by aviation experts as unheard of, is detailed in a report by the air accidents investigations branch, released today. The pilot told investigators that after the bolt of lightning hit he felt as if he had been kicked in the chest. The incident is one of two detailed by the AAIB today. In the other, an RAF jet came within 100ft of crashing into a passenger aircraft with 14 people on board last March, prompting the AAIB to call for an urgent review. The incident where the pilot was burned happened after a BA flight had left Heathrow airport in October last year, and was 10 minutes from landing at Amsterdam's Schipol airport when the lightning struck. The 54-year-old first officer was at the controls of the Boeing 757, acting as the \"handling pilot\", trying to fly the plane between two storm systems. The plane had descended from its maximum height of 35,000ft to 5,000ft as it prepared for an imminent landing. According to the report: \"The first officer was seated with his right hand and part of his right arm resting on the cockpit coaming close to the right forward windscreen. \"At about 5,000ft on the approach the aircraft was struck by lightning just below the right windscreen. \"The first officer was aware of a loud bang and bright flash and described feeling as if he had been kicked in the chest. \"After recovering from the initial surprise the first officer found difficulty in using his right arm. He handed over control to the commander, and reverted to a non-handling pilot. \"After landing the first officer was taken for a medical examination that revealed a burn wound in his chest consistent with an electrical discharge.\" The first officer was able to return to flying duties within a fortnight, but the AAIB report says he \"has subsequently developed a medical condition that may be a consequence of the incident\". A BA spokesman stressed that the 151 passengers and seven crew on board were never in any danger and that the plane had landed safely. Usually pilots try to fly their craft either over or around a storm system. The pilot was still off work, said BA, declining to name him. The AAIB calls today for a review of the risks of mid-air collisions in airspace where planes fly outside the control of air traffic controllers, so- called uncontrolled airspace. It follows an incident last March where an RAF Tornado came within feet of crashing into a passenger jet with 14 people aboard at 5,000ft. Both planes were in uncontrolled airspace near Newcastle airport when the near miss happened, with the craft coming within 100ft of each other. The Tornado was travelling so fast that neither pilot had time to take any avoiding action. The civilian plane, a Gill Airways' Shorts SD360, was flying from Aberdeen to Newcastle and carrying 11 passengers. The Tornado was one of four based at RAF Leuchars in St Andrews, which were taking part in a night training exercise involving up to 32 jets. The report said that statistics from the UK Airprox Board, which investigates near misses, showed that from January 1990 to March 2000, there were 87 reports of near misses involving military aircraft and commercial planes in uncontrolled airspace below 10,000ft.",

      "body": "<p>William Masters, who has died at the age of 85, was one of the first and leading researchers in the field of human sexuality. With his colleague and sometime wife Virginia Johnson, he could legitimately claim to have done more for couple relationships and marital satisfaction in the last 35 years than that other 60s icon, the contraceptive pill.</p> <p>The sex therapy programme they developed aimed to help clients by providing sex information, alleviating anxiety about sexual performance and encouraging verbal, emotional and physical communication with their partners. Before this, any approach to sexual disorders had focused on the individual. Masters and Johnson included both partners in the therapy process, emphasising mutual responsibility for change and for finding a solution to their problems.</p> <p>Born in Cleveland, Masters became interested in the nature of sexuality while studying medicine in New York in the early 1940s, and wanted to conduct research that would lead to an objective understanding of the topics. He joined the Washington University school of medicine in 1947, and began researching sexual functions in 1954. Three years later, Johnson joined him as a research assistant, and they soon became a pioneering team.</p> <p>Their investigation of the physical aspects of sexuality produced some of the first reliable data in the field, and widened public debate and awareness of the role of sex and sexuality in relationships. Alfred Kinsey and his co-workers had began that debate with Sexual Behaviour In The Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behaviour In The Human Female (1953), which, among other things, had disclosed the frequency of various sexual practices, including homosexuality. They had caused a furore, with critics voicing the view that the study and public discussion of sexual behaviour would undermine the family and society.</p> <p>Masters himself believed that \"science, by itself, has no moral dimension, but it does seek to establish truth, and upon this truth morality can be built\" - and he and Johnson set out to find the truth. Their initial research, with 312 men and 382 women, was published as Human Sexual Response (1966), and remains the keystone of modern sex therapy, wherever it is studied or practised.</p> <p>While Kinsey discovered how many people were doing what, Masters and Johnson explained what happened when they did it. Using polygraph-like instruments, laboratory observation and measurement of their research subjects while they were having intercourse or masturbating, the couple identified four phases in the human sexual response cycle - excitement, plateau, orgasm and resolution.</p> <p>Although written for the medical community, Human Sexual Response became a bestseller, as did Masters and Johnson's next book, Human Sexual Inadequacy (1970), which was concerned with the treatment of impotence, premature ejaculation, lack of sexual desire and other sexual problems. In the wake of these two publications, the field of sex therapy - the clinical treatment of sexual problems - was born.</p> <p>In 1964, Masters and Johnson had established the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation in St Louis, with Masters as its director. During this period, he and his first wife divorced and, in 1971, he married Johnson.</p> <p>Two years later, she became co-director and both became directors of the Masters and Johnson Institute, a clinic for the treatment of sexual problems. Many of the students who trained at their centre went on to establish practices in sex therapy across America, and most of the therapeutic practices begun at the clinic, such as assisting couples to more fully experience and focus on basic physical sensations, remain central to contemporary sex therapy worldwide.</p> <p>Masters and Johnson used a male-female, dual-therapy team, and a brief, intensive re-education process that involved behavioural exercises such as sensate focus, which encourage each partner to take turns in paying increased attention to their own senses. These exercises were originally developed to help couples experiencing sexual problems, but are also used today to heighten personal awareness and spice up couples' sex lives. As part of a comprehensive psychotherapy programme, they can have a dramatic effect, even in cases where severe sexual dysfunction has lasted for many years.</p> <p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Masters and Johnson continued their work, publishing The Pleasure Bond (1974), a fresh look at sexuality and commitment, and Homosexuality In Perspective (1979), which described the sexual responses of gay men and lesbians. They debunked the idea that homosexuality is a mental illness, but their claims to be able to change the sexual preferences of homosexuals met with considerable criticism from the gay community and other sex researchers. A further work, Human Sexuality, appeared in 1982.</p> <p>The couple's later book, Crisis: Heterosexual Behaviour In The Age Of Aids (1988), co-written with Robert C Kolodny, provoked another storm, this time from Aids researchers and health workers who disputed their findings. Masters, Johnson and Kolodny advanced the theory, now largely accepted, that engaging in risky sexual practices may be as important as membership of a high-risk group, such as drug users, in defining HIV risk, and also recommended safer sex practices for heterosexual, non-drug users.</p> <p>Masters and Johnson worked together until 1992, and continued to collaborate, after their divorce the following year, on Heterosexuality, which was published in 1994, the year that Masters retired and left St Louis.</p> <p>The expectation that sex should be a source of pleasure, personal development and empowerment for all is a legacy of the 20th century which Masters and Johnson were instrumental in developing. Their contribution on problems of sexual functioning and therapeutic interventions remains among the most significant work in these areas.</p> <p>Back in 1992, Masters had complained that Americans still had not cast off their puritanism about sex. He could, however, note with satisfaction that all but two or three American medical schools by then included courses on human sexuality.

Her confidence may be well-founded: while her announcement may have sent Department of Health mandarins into a spin, a government which says it supports family-friendly employment policies cannot be seen to be a careless employer.</p> <p>Ms Cooper has already rescheduled her day to ensure that her red boxes are dealt with during the day instead of at home in the evening as is traditional, leaving her free to spend time with her family.</p> <p>\"It's business as usual,\" she insisted, amid a breakneck schedule of meetings, a hospital visit and a sweet factory tour in her Pontefract and Castleford constituency. \"Millions of women take maternity leave from jobs and it ought to be normal in every occupation and every walk of life. People at work have families too.</p> <p>\"One day no one will bat an eyelid at ministers taking maternity leave because of course it's something that ministers, MPs, nurses, businesswomen and everybody else needs to be able to do.\"</p> <p>Ms Cooper, who took five months' maternity leave after the birth of Ellie, now 20 months, is keen to see attention paid instead to the maternity and child health services she will be using.</p> <p>Under a new drive to address the inequalities which mean that UK children from low income backgrounds suffer poorer health and higher death rates than their more affluent counterparts, the government has set a new infant mortality target. Amid evidence that the death rate of babies under one in the lowest income areas is 70% higher than in the most affluent areas, the aim is to reduce the gap between the poorest and the average by 10% in 10 years.</p> <p><b> Equal treatment</b><br></p> <p>In a move designed to iron out the postcode lottery affecting child health care, ministers are to draw up a new children's national service framework - NHS jargon for a plan to offer equal treatment and services, including maternity care, across the country.</p> <p>The step follows recent moves to extend the Sure Start programme, aimed at helping poorer families with children under four, to support expectant mothers, and an initiative to provide free daily fruit in infant schools.</p> <p>Ms Cooper, who pushed strongly within her department for the focus on child health, points to the relatively lower birthweight of babies from low income homes, together with statistics showing that smaller babies have increased risk of higher blood pressure and heart disease later in life. \"If you look at the health inequalities issue, so many of them are rooted very early in life, if not passed down from one generation to another.\"</p> <p>The government, with its pledge to abolish child poverty within 20 years, has much to do: the latest published figures, for 1998/99, show that 4.5m children in the UK were living in poverty: one of the worst rates among industrialised countries. The numbers have since been reduced by 1m, according to government figures, but child poverty campaigners warn those deepest in poverty will be hardest to lift out.</p> <p><b> More passionate</b><br></p> <p>Ms Cooper admits personal experience has strengthened her concern over child health. \"When you are a parent, inevitably, it makes you more sensitive or more passionate about what happens to young children because it is what you see immediately around you in your own life. In the same way, when you are using maternity services, and talking to other parents, that can be quite effective for the policy-making process because you are not divorced from the policy area you are working on.\"</p> <p>Ms Cooper will take the statutory 18 weeks leave, on full ministerial pay. At the birth of the baby, her husband, Ed Balls, also at New Labour's epicentre as chancellor Gordon Brown's closest aide, will take two weeks' paternity leave and will continue to help out with childcare in the evenings.</p> <p>Publicly, she will refuse to admit she is doing anything unusual, though the prospect of a minister taking maternity leave inevitably breaks new ground. \"It has never been done before - this is new territory and it will take some time to work out how to do it. The department will have to look at what the best arrangements are. But I have found everybody is very keen to make it work.\"</p>",

People at work have families too. \"One day no one will bat an eyelid at ministers taking maternity leave because of course it's something that ministers, MPs, nurses, businesswomen and everybody else needs to be able to do.\" Ms Cooper, who took five months' maternity leave after the birth of Ellie, now 20 months, is keen to see attention paid instead to the maternity and child health services she will be using. Under a new drive to address the inequalities which mean that UK children from low income backgrounds suffer poorer health and higher death rates than their more affluent counterparts, the government has set a new infant mortality target. Amid evidence that the death rate of babies under one in the lowest income areas is 70% higher than in the most affluent areas, the aim is to reduce the gap between the poorest and the average by 10% in 10 years. Equal treatment In a move designed to iron out the postcode lottery affecting child health care, ministers are to draw up a new children's national service framework - NHS jargon for a plan to offer equal treatment and services, including maternity care, across the country. The step follows recent moves to extend the Sure Start programme, aimed at helping poorer families with children under four, to support expectant mothers, and an initiative to provide free daily fruit in infant schools. Ms Cooper, who pushed strongly within her department for the focus on child health, points to the relatively lower birthweight of babies from low income homes, together with statistics showing that smaller babies have increased risk of higher blood pressure and heart disease later in life. \"If you look at the health inequalities issue, so many of them are rooted very early in life, if not passed down from one generation to another.\" The government, with its pledge to abolish child poverty within 20 years, has much to do: the latest published figures, for 1998/99, show that 4.5m children in the UK were living in poverty: one of the worst rates among industrialised countries. The numbers have since been reduced by 1m, according to government figures, but child poverty campaigners warn those deepest in poverty will be hardest to lift out. More passionate Ms Cooper admits personal experience has strengthened her concern over child health. \"When you are a parent, inevitably, it makes you more sensitive or more passionate about what happens to young children because it is what you see immediately around you in your own life. In the same way, when you are using maternity services, and talking to other parents, that can be quite effective for the policy-making process because you are not divorced from the policy area you are working on.\" Ms Cooper will take the statutory 18 weeks leave, on full ministerial pay. At the birth of the baby, her husband, Ed Balls, also at New Labour's epicentre as chancellor Gordon Brown's closest aide, will take two weeks' paternity leave and will continue to help out with childcare in the evenings. Publicly, she will refuse to admit she is doing anything unusual, though the prospect of a minister taking maternity leave inevitably breaks new ground. \"It has never been done before - this is new territory and it will take some time to work out how to do it. The department will have to look at what the best arrangements are. But I have found everybody is very keen to make it work.\"",

There will be the small one in Harare before he flies off in a futile bid to persuade international bankers to give him more money. Then there will be a big bash at Victoria Falls at the weekend, loans or no loans. With one eye on a looming presidential election, all sorts of people have made the invitation list to Victoria Falls who might otherwise have been ignored. Aside from the usual cronies and government officials, young men and women from the youth groups loyal to the ruling party suddenly find themselves in favour; they do not usually get much attention from the president, but every vote is going to count in this election, which may be just months away. Also, young men are not only good at getting Mr Mugabe's supporters out; they will prove useful in ensuring that opposition supporters stay away from the ballot boxes. The celebrations at Victoria Falls are being organised by the 21st February Movement, a group named after Mr Mugabe's date of birth, and one which might be more at home in North Korea in the light of its attempts to build a personality cult around him. The party will be paid for by Zimbabwean taxpayers, very few of whom think it is money well spent, despite the movement's attempts to whip up enthusiasm. Some view the celebrations as a particularly perverse taunt given the state of Zimbabwe's finances and the misery engulfing the country. The guest list is a who's who of Africa's historic liberation movements and ruling parties. Tony Blair has not been invited. There are those among Zimbabwe's neighbours who think it might not be a bad thing if this were Mr Mugabe's last birthday as president.

The fact that I grew up in south Wales and none of my friends then was Asian or understood the language didn't matter. Bollywood films have other ways of communicating with a wide audience.

      "bodyText": "A public row between Turkey's president and prime minister has provoked a renewed financial crisis and highlighted the biggest challenge facing the country - how to deal with the web of corruption that has shaped Turkey for a generation. The prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, stormed out of a routine meeting of the national security council on Monday, saying he had been insulted by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer. Mr Sezer had harangued the government for looking into corruption allegations too slowly. \"You are sitting on the mud. We can clean it up if you're not going to do it,\" he reportedly said. \"Why are you scared of the corruption investigations?\" A copy of the constitution was thrown back and forth across the table before Mr Ecevit and members of his cabinet walked out. An angry prime minister then went on national television to speak of a serious political crisis. The markets believed the government was about to resign. Within minutes several billion pounds had been wiped off share values, and several billion more had been sold from the foreign exchange reserves of the central bank. Yesterday the markets stabilised, but some interest rates soared to more than 1,000%. The latest row between Mr Sezer and Mr Ecevit, who have had several high-profile disputes, is a fundamental disagreement about how the state system should operate. President Sezer has reactivated a rarely used state inspection board to investigate the political plunder of public banks over the last decade. Mr Ecevit had already appointed investigators, and is angry that the president seems to be \"inspecting his inspectors\". Both men have reputations for honesty, and Mr Ecevit clearly believes his integrity has been called into question by the president's criticism. Whoever is to blame for the current crisis, there is a widespread belief in Turkey that things cannot stumble on as they are. But changing the system will be a massive task. \"Corruption has eaten into everything,\" said Metin Munir, a leading financial journalist. \"It's like a disease, and Turkey can't bear it any longer.\" There are entrenched interests who have a lot to lose from a cleaner economy. Many are part of a political system which has lost the confidence of the people. Several leading politicians have been the target of corruption claims that have been dropped at politically convenient moments. The government insists it has done more than its predecessors to expose corruption, and wants a public apology from the president. Sceptics say that as long as the old guard investigates itself, nothing lasting will be achieved. But if Mr Ecevit allows a large-scale anti-corruption drive, he may sacrifice the political stability needed to push through economic reforms. All the while, Turks seem gloomier than ever about their country's prospects. \"We've had the political theatre,\" said Hakan Avci, a financial analyst with Global Securities. \"Now we're waiting to see if the president and the prime minister can find some way to work together.

      "bodyText": "Analysis of the skeleton of a child buried on the eve of the fall of the Roman empire has revealed that the barbarians may have had a secret ally: malaria. British and American researchers say that DNA from the 1,500-year-old bones, found in a cemetery north of Rome, yielded evidence of an epidemic. A lethal outbreak could partly explain why antiquity's mightiest military machine was too enfeebled to repel the Visigoths, Huns and Vandals. The discovery - the earliest genetic evidence of malaria yet identified - has been hailed as a breakthrough in the collaboration between archaeology and biomolecular science. Excavations at a cemetery for infants in Lugnano, dated to the year 450, found a leg bone of a three-year-old child suffering from Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent form of human malaria. Around 50 infants' skeletons were buried within a short period of time, suggesting an epidemic. The smallest skeletons were too degraded to produce DNA samples but some had pitted cranium surfaces - another sign of malaria. The disease is thought to have spawned panic: despite the fact that Romans were by then officially Christians, pagan offerings such as a raven's claw and decapitated puppy skeletons were found nearby. Malaria is a mosquito-borne fever caused by a protozoan parasite which thrives in warm, marshy areas such as the Tiber river valley. The falciparum strain causes miscarriage and infant death. Some historians had long suspected that malaria contributed to the empire's decline and fall by sapping morale and manpower. Robert Sallares, a research fellow at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, and Susan Comz, a student, reported their results in the journal Ancient Biomolecules. The skeleton was recovered in the early 1990s by ateam of archaeologists led by David Soren of the University of Arizona. He told the Washington Post that the DNA findings were new and exciting. \"The idea that this deadly type of malaria really existed in imperial Rome had never been documented.\" Rot set into the empire from the late second century.

      "bodyText": "The United Nations is investigating allegations that some of its employees were members of an organised crime network in Africa which took bribes to resettle refugees in the west. Paul Stromberg, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), confirmed reports that at least four people who had worked out of the Nairobi office were being investigated. One of the four is understood to be a European. Mr Stromberg said a number of refugees had alleged that they were asked to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 (\u00a31,400-\u00a33,500) to be resettled in north America, Europe and Australia. \"[The investigation] may involve more than four people. How many people will be investigated, how many people may have charges brought against them we will only know when the... UN watchdog agency gives its final report.\" The investigation is understood to be looking beyond resettlement cases to reports that guards charged refugees for entry into UNHCR compounds, and that UN workers demanded payment for appointments and for basic services, he said. UN staff who allegedly extorted money from refugees should be \"harshly\" punished if proved guilty, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, said yesterday. \"I think it is abominable that refugees who are already suffering, who are displaced, whose lives have been uprooted, should be exploited in this manner,\" he said. Many refugees say they believed paying a fee to UNHCR officials increased their chances of being given asylum. \"The refugees who have money do not have the problems that everyone else has,\" Celestin Kangambo, who fled Congo after his parents were killed by rebels, said outside the UNHCR office in Nairobi. \"As refugees we talk to each other, and there are refugees who have accomplished the process by money,\" Destaw Berhanu, a refugee from Ethiopia, said. Mr Annan said: \"It was important that we discovered this quite early and got to work very quickly.\" The office in Nairobi had carried out an \"inconclusive\" investigation, he said, adding that the UN's Office of Internal Oversight, based in New York, had taken over the inquiry. \"We are determined to go to the bottom of this and deal with those are responsible. Of course we will have to take measures to make sure that it does not reoccur and tighten our controls,\" Mr Annan said. More than 9,000 refugees, mostly from Somalia and Sudan, were resettled through Kenya last year, mainly to the US, Australia, New Zealand and Scandinavia. Three of the UNHCR's staff under investigation have not been suspended but have been moved off tasks related to the movement of refugees. The European has not had his contract renewed. There also appear to be links to organised crime groups, and four international UNHCR staff have had to be moved from Kenya after receiving death threats because of their knowledge of the situation, Mr Stromberg said. \"Human trafficking is something which involves in many countries very highly organised and very violent criminal groups,\" he said. \"They made very serious threats against our staff.\" Investigations, which began in Nairobi in December 1999, are expected to be complete within the next few months. Mr Stromberg acknowledged that the allegations were deeply embarrassing for the UNHCR, which is responsible for screening the suitability of refugees who request asylum in western countries. \"We take it very seriously,\" he said. \"It's clearly a corruption of the [UNHCR] mandate if the allegations are true.\"",

      "body": "<p>Commuters enraged when a signal failure forced the cancellation of dozens of trains at rush hour on Monday night burned down a large part of Pretoria's historic railway station.</p> <p>About 6,000 travellers stormed the station's passenger services office after failing to break into the control room. They smashed through a glass wall, destroyed computers and a few set fire to the 91-year-old station designed by one of South Africa's most famous architects, Sir Herbert Baker.</p> <p>The roof and third floor of the national monument were destroyed and much of the rest of the building was damaged by water as about 80 firefighters spent the night dousing the blaze.</p> <p>Witnesses said guards on the station platform fled as passengers vented their anger on any official connected with the railways.</p> <p>The train firm, Metrorail, blamed the breakdown on the theft of a fibre optic cable. Its chief executive, Honey Mateya, said the problem was compounded by a communications failure which left commuters standing on the platforms with no information. \"It was almost operationally hopeless,\" he conceded.</p> <p>But he condemned the arson. \"This kind of behaviour is not acceptable... It is not good for our image,\" he said.</p> <p>Long delays, often with commuters stuck in idle trains, are common in South Africa, as are cancelled services with no explanation. Sometimes a bus is laid on, but usually there are not enough seats for all the passengers.</p> <p>\"Metrorail would leave us at the station all night and not care,\" said Timid Moekeletsi. \"Our children are waiting for their food. They are saying: 'Where are our mothers and fathers?' But they know. Their parents are prisoners on the train. It happens almost every day.\"</p> <p>On Monday a woman was hit by a passing train in Johannesburg when passengers forced open doors and started walking along the track after their train had been stationary for close to an hour.</p> <p>But the fire in Pretoria only compounded the misery for commuters yesterday as thousands of people arrived at the station to find it sealed off by soldiers and riot police with barbed wire. About 70% of train services to other stations in the Pretoria area were cancelled or late.</p> <p>The rail company sent buses to some townships but there were too few vehicles. The mood was reported to be tense in Atteridgeville where commuters were left completely stranded.</p> <p>The railways corporation which owns Pretoria station said preliminary investigations suggested that the main structure could be saved but that it is necessary to wait two days for the temperature to settle before a final assessment could be made.</p> <p>\"These incidents make our insurers, Lloyd's of London, very, very nervous about insuring us,\" said Ben van der Ross, head of the corporation.</p> <p>The transport minister, Dullah Omar, condemned the riot. \"I understand the frustration of commuters when there are delays, but this should never be allowed to find expression in violence,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Commuters enraged when a signal failure forced the cancellation of dozens of trains at rush hour on Monday night burned down a large part of Pretoria's historic railway station. About 6,000 travellers stormed the station's passenger services office after failing to break into the control room. They smashed through a glass wall, destroyed computers and a few set fire to the 91-year-old station designed by one of South Africa's most famous architects, Sir Herbert Baker. The roof and third floor of the national monument were destroyed and much of the rest of the building was damaged by water as about 80 firefighters spent the night dousing the blaze. Witnesses said guards on the station platform fled as passengers vented their anger on any official connected with the railways. The train firm, Metrorail, blamed the breakdown on the theft of a fibre optic cable. Its chief executive, Honey Mateya, said the problem was compounded by a communications failure which left commuters standing on the platforms with no information. \"It was almost operationally hopeless,\" he conceded. But he condemned the arson. \"This kind of behaviour is not acceptable... It is not good for our image,\" he said. Long delays, often with commuters stuck in idle trains, are common in South Africa, as are cancelled services with no explanation. Sometimes a bus is laid on, but usually there are not enough seats for all the passengers. \"Metrorail would leave us at the station all night and not care,\" said Timid Moekeletsi. \"Our children are waiting for their food. They are saying: 'Where are our mothers and fathers?' But they know. Their parents are prisoners on the train. It happens almost every day.\" On Monday a woman was hit by a passing train in Johannesburg when passengers forced open doors and started walking along the track after their train had been stationary for close to an hour. But the fire in Pretoria only compounded the misery for commuters yesterday as thousands of people arrived at the station to find it sealed off by soldiers and riot police with barbed wire. About 70% of train services to other stations in the Pretoria area were cancelled or late. The rail company sent buses to some townships but there were too few vehicles. The mood was reported to be tense in Atteridgeville where commuters were left completely stranded. The railways corporation which owns Pretoria station said preliminary investigations suggested that the main structure could be saved but that it is necessary to wait two days for the temperature to settle before a final assessment could be made. \"These incidents make our insurers, Lloyd's of London, very, very nervous about insuring us,\" said Ben van der Ross, head of the corporation. The transport minister, Dullah Omar, condemned the riot. \"I understand the frustration of commuters when there are delays, but this should never be allowed to find expression in violence,\" he said.",

Patagonian tooth fish are worth \u00a38 a kilo for sushi and sashimi and the illegal trade in this catch alone is worth \u00a3300m annually. Individual blue fin tuna, now an endangered species, have fetched up to \u00a330,000 on the Japanese market.",

      "bodyText": "The latest Guardian/ICM poll shows that neither Labour's little local difficulties nor the Tories' recent policy extravaganza - an announcement a minute - have had any effect on the government's support. The Mandelson-Hinduja and now the Irvine dramas probably do affect people's medium-to-long-run perceptions of a party and political system, for the worse. But in the short run Labour is suffering no electoral pain. Indeed its lead has gone up. Perhaps voters are registering the unmistakable signs of an impending election and firming up their long-held belief that Tony Blair deserves a second term. Today he gets useful backing on specifics, too. ICM's results on secondary education suggest the public shares his wish to reconcile the comprehensive principle - which gets a 72% approval rating - with practical selection of pupils on the basis of aptitude, applauded by nearly 60%. While the 18% against comprehensives can vote Tory, the 31% against secondary selection have nowhere else to go. Of course the usual caveats apply to such polls. Surveys of voting intentions exclude don't knows yet the ranks of the undecided have been growing. Apathy would not, however, necessarily affect Labour's tally of Commons' seats. Prime ministers have bags of freedom (too much, we would say) to pick election dates but Mr Blair needs to decide sharpish: the public may well start to re sent being denied the decision they evidently have now made. They might seek to punish the man who is keeping them hanging on. So is Labour's lead a manifestation of the \"feel good\" factor that famously did not guarantee Al Gore's victory in the United States last year? Recent headlines have certainly been positive, with interest rates, growth and mortgage wars to cheapen borrowing and stimulate house prices (see below).

Spokesman Keith Fearby said the 80 pupils were accompanied by nine or 10 teachers on their week-long trip to the resort. Press Association",

      "body": "<p>Some 40 rough sleepers are in for the night at the centre under Trafalgar Square, dozing, watching TV and bickering. There's the quietly spoken gardener who became homeless after losing the job he'd held for 40 years, and the young man whose staring eyes and loud indignation betray obvious mental health problems. He's spent most of the last year living in a tent on a bypass. \"I hardly spoke to a soul for nine months,\" he yells.</p> <p>With state-funded outreach workers referring London's street homeless to the centre as a first step to services and a long-term solution, the project carries all the hallmarks of the government's social exclusion programme. What is less obvious is that it is part of a growing trend to involve faith communities in the provision of public services. Opened last September, as an extension to the social work done by the Anglican church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the night centre gets all its funding - \u00a3400,000 a year - from the government's rough sleepers' unit. </p> <p>This month's announcements on both sides of the Atlantic are proof positive, if more were needed, that faith groups have made it on to the political agenda. While one of US president George Bush's first moves has been to entrust social services to the churches, British opposition leader William Hague has continued to court the black Christian vote with the promise of an office of civil society to \"empower\" faith groups and the voluntary sector. And religious leaders are using their new power. An evangelical Christian charity, Oasis Trust, has launched a campaign to persuade the next government to give faith groups a better hearing. Having surveyed 2,000 Christian leaders, the trust claims one in five is discriminated against when seeking government support. It is going out with road shows to faith groups around the country, giving advice on political and media lobbying.</p> <p>Yet the government is already engaged with faith groups. The rough sleepers' strategy relies heavily on church-based organisations - from those with long traditions of street philanthropy, such as the Salvation Army, to more innovative schemes. While this might stem from a pragmatic decision to join forces with those already doing the work, with the faith element largely irrelevant, in education the recognition of religious life has developed as a natural feature of a multi-cultural society. Having brought the first Muslim and Sikh schools into the state system, the government is now encouraging schools of all denominations to follow. </p> <p>But the most concentrated attempt to harness faith groups has been simmering in the social exclusion unit for some time. The conclusions of the unit's policy action teams, recognising the role played by such groups in social and economic life, have now made it into government policy: the action plan on neighbourhood renewal identifies them as a key element to the success of regeneration partnerships.</p> <p>The unit is now running a series of events to inform religious leaders of their role in the action plan. And the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) plans to launch pilots with faith groups as partners in the New Deal for communities programme early in the summer.</p> <p>Much of the thinking behind this activity comes from a recognition that government has to work harder to engage with Britain's black and ethnic minorities. Since religion is integral to their identity and daily lives, challenging received ideas about the secular nature of public life may be the price of being truly inclusive. </p> <p>Saif Ahmed, chief executive of the North London Muslim Housing Association, and a former member of the policy action team on unpopular housing, points out: \"If you exclude the Muslim faith community, you are excluding the Muslim majority from any government agenda.\"</p> <p>The Muslim-led Salfai Association Community Centre, in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, already provides IT training courses and acess to computers and the internet, in conjunction with Dewsbury college, primarily for local Muslims. It is about to become involved in the government's online initiative, in partnership with Kirklees council. Run from a converted textile mill, the \u00a3650,000 centre was opened last April, with funds raised by the Muslim community matched by the single regeneration budget. Its facilities include day care for elderly people, a creche, youth club, homework club and a number of classes. It also houses a mosque. </p> <p>Centre manager David Hay says it is designed to serve the whole community but must work hard to ensure that non-Muslims take advantage of what it has to offer. \"Already there is a 50:50 mix in the youth club and homework club and some of our new courses, such as beauty therapy and food hygiene,\" he points out.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ahmed's association is running faith-based regeneration pilots, including a multi-faith project, in north and east London. The religious belief of those involved makes all the difference, he says. \"There is a passion to see changes take place because it is part of their faith. They believe if they do something for humanity, it makes God happy.\"</p> <p>The association will shortly publish research on the housing needs of young Muslims in Hackney, east London. It confirms the centrality of the mosque to the tenants' lives, but also finds that the mosque authorities do not meet the needs of Muslim women. While Ahmed insists that projects will push for a more inclusive approach, the exclusion of certain groups on religious grounds is precisely what worries those opposed to the greater involvement of faith groups in public service.</p> <p>Examples documented by the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement include St George's Crypt Centre, a church-run homeless charity in Leeds. A gay job applicant ran up against an equal opportunities policy declaring active homosexuals - together with adulterers and those involved in occult practices - to be contrary to its \"Christian ethos\". </p> <p>In the face of such practice, critics see the shift towards more public funding of faith groups as the key problem. \"The big Rubicon is taxpayers' money,\" says Keith Porteous Wood, general secretary of the National Secular Society. \"Once you've accepted that, you're entitled to demand that there will be no discrimination in the service that's provided and in the employment of the staff.\"</p> <p>But religious groups will get no special treatment, according to one of the main players in the new faith-friendly politics. For David Raynor, secretary to the Inner Cities Religious Council, the only faith-based forum in government and a semi-independent body linked to the DETR, faith groups are \"an integral part of civil society, viewed as equals with others\". He adds: \"What I find difficult is the discourse which says that faith communities bring values and morals, as though other bodies did not.\"</p> <p>Yet religious leaders argue that the spiritual energy that politicians want to capture inevitably sets them apart from other organisations. Pecan is a Christian training charity whose work on the Peckham estates in south London won it first place in the neighbourhood renewal action plan's list of good practice. The charity's approach to unemployment aims, through systematic door-knocking, to find the people missed by other schemes and link them into training opportunities. Through its community induction project, all new tenants on the rebuilt North Peckham estates have been receiving visits to help them settle in the refigured community. Although, from the outside, this kind of work may be seen as simply good provision, managing director Simon Pellew insists it arises out of the charity's Christianity and \"comes out of our theology\".</p> <p>This faith element will inevitably make for tensions as government and faith groups work more closely together, Pellew believes. Pecan's annual budget of \u00a31.5m includes 80% state funding and, Pellew points out, \"any money has strings attached. Government has to understand that, as a faith-driven organisation, we may do things they don't like. For example, Pecan only employs Christians.\"</p> <p>The crunch comes where the need of faith groups to keep their identity runs up against the requirement for public services to be neutral - and professional. \"It's not sufficient to be enthusiastic - you've got to be professional as well,\" says Graham Dale, director of the Christian Socialist Movement.</p> <p>\"You don't have to be Christian to come in through the door,\" says Chris Edwards, director of St Martin's night centre. \"We offer non-judgmental acceptance of anyone. The values of the church inform very strongly what we do here.\"</p> <p><strong>Tapping into traditions</strong></p> <p>Some local authorities have been quietly furthering the faith agenda for years.

Its joint review report concludes: \"The authority can boast of superior skills andproficiency in meeting the needs of its population.\" </p> <p>The report will be particularly welcome to the Association of Directors of Social Services, as its current president, Moira Gibb, is Kensington and Chelsea's social services director. </p> <p>How is the council succeeding where so many of its London neighbours are not? While parts of the borough are famously wealthy, it also has its share of deprivation and social problems. Although 50% of children go to private schools, 40% of those who do not are eligible for a free lunch. </p> <p>According to the joint review team, much of the good work comes down to senior managers' \"obsession with the frontline\" - originating six years ago in a strategy which concentrated minds on delivery of flexible services responsive to needs, working in partnership and demonstrating value. </p> <p>Warwick Lightfoot, the authority's chairman of housing and social services, says: \"We try, where we can, to act as though we were choosing services for a relative. This means we are prepared to spend, but only in return for practical, high quality services.\" </p> <p>One area where success has been remarkable is the refocusing of services from dealing with the consequences of family crises to preventing them. As a result, relatively low numbers of children are on the protection register or in care. </p> <p>The report also praises services including the Oremi resource centre for African-Caribbean people with mental health problems, drug and alcohol teams, dementia care and provision for young people leaving care - the latter having already earned the council \"beacon\" status under the government's drive to spread good practice. </p> <p>John Bolton, director of the joint reviews programme, says: \"Kensington and Chelsea can congratulate themselves on the successful delivery of good quality services which meet the requirements of local people.\" </p> <p>The report is available at \u00a315 from audit commission publications on 0800-502030</p>",

Its joint review report concludes: \"The authority can boast of superior skills andproficiency in meeting the needs of its population.\" The report will be particularly welcome to the Association of Directors of Social Services, as its current president, Moira Gibb, is Kensington and Chelsea's social services director. How is the council succeeding where so many of its London neighbours are not? While parts of the borough are famously wealthy, it also has its share of deprivation and social problems. Although 50% of children go to private schools, 40% of those who do not are eligible for a free lunch. According to the joint review team, much of the good work comes down to senior managers' \"obsession with the frontline\" - originating six years ago in a strategy which concentrated minds on delivery of flexible services responsive to needs, working in partnership and demonstrating value. Warwick Lightfoot, the authority's chairman of housing and social services, says: \"We try, where we can, to act as though we were choosing services for a relative. This means we are prepared to spend, but only in return for practical, high quality services.\" One area where success has been remarkable is the refocusing of services from dealing with the consequences of family crises to preventing them. As a result, relatively low numbers of children are on the protection register or in care. The report also praises services including the Oremi resource centre for African-Caribbean people with mental health problems, drug and alcohol teams, dementia care and provision for young people leaving care - the latter having already earned the council \"beacon\" status under the government's drive to spread good practice. John Bolton, director of the joint reviews programme, says: \"Kensington and Chelsea can congratulate themselves on the successful delivery of good quality services which meet the requirements of local people.\" The report is available at \u00a315 from audit commission publications on 0800-502030",

      "body": "<p>Black Africans living in Britain are the target of a new campaign launched today by a leading HIV/Aids charity. Terrence Higgins Trust Lighthouse is seeking to curb the rapid increase in HIV infection in the African community, which has emerged as the most pressing concern among those working to combat the disease. </p> <p>The charity is holding a conference in London to address issues of prevention and is due to start a three-month poster campaign. The key aim is to tackle the stigma surrounding HIV, which hinders black Africans from seeking advice on prevention or coming forward for testing. </p> <p>The number of new reports of HIV infection is now higher among heterosexuals than gays or bisexuals. In 1996, heterosexual sex accounted for 29% of new reported infections; by 1999, it accounted for 49% of new reports. The increase is attributed largely to a growing number of reported cases among black Africans. </p> <p>The majority of HIV transmissions during pregnancy also occur among black African women. And most black Africans seek treatment only once they have symptoms of the disease. </p> <p>Pat Nair, consultant in communicable disease control with Bedfordshire health authority, will report to today's conference on a 200% increase in reports of HIV in Luton. Just over half of those affected were born in Zimbabwe and 86% had arrived in Britain since 1998. </p> <p>A representative from the Public Health Laboratory Service will highlight a study in Camden and Islington, north London, which found that 70% of 748 black African respondents did not use condoms with new sexual partners. </p> <p>Liza Kawonza, a Zimbabwean health promotion manager in Terrence Higgins Trust Lighthouse's African team, says: \"Within our community, because of religious and cultural beliefs, once you are known to be HIV positive you are no longer considered a human being.\" </p> <p>Themba (not his real name), a 40-year-old black African who is HIV positive, confirms this. \"I have lost most of my friends and my life has become much more narrow,\" he says. \"People still think they can be infected by coughing or sharing cutlery.\" He adds: \"There is a sense of shame around sex, and a belief that if you catch a disease it is from your own evil doings and you don't deserve support.\" </p> <p>Kawonza maintains that HIV is often associated by black Africans with promiscuity and homosexuality. \"This prejudice is based on ignorance which, through the campaign, we are hoping to show has parallels with racism,\" she says. </p> <p>The poster campaign will use familiar images of segregation in Africa to challenge black people's own prejudice towards HIV. Kawonza says the campaign is not concerned with talking about safe sex, or apportioning blame, but is about changing attitudes to make it more acceptable for people to talk about HIV and come forward for tests. If people could seek help earlier, she argues, they would be better able to take control of their treatment and live longer. </p> <p> The charity hopes its message will spread across Europe and Africa. It has been shown to African people at various stages of its development and the response is said to have been \"overwhelming\". Posters will be displayed in community centres, hairdressers, churches, bars and taxi offices. </p> <p>Themba, however, is sceptical about the campaign. He says: \"The stigma will not go away for a long time. The posters are about encouraging people not to be afraid to talk about HIV. People are not ready to do that. The few people who have come out as HIV positive have become superstars, and this deters other people from disclosing their status.\" </p> <p>He argues that the campaign should be about encouraging people to take diagnostic tests and assuring them of confidentiality. He is, however, more hopeful of a research forum which is also being launched at the conference. </p> <p>Ade Fakoya, a consultant specialising in HIV, will introduce the African research forum to delegates. Based at Newham General hospital, east London, he wants to draw together specialists and involve the black African community in planning research. </p> <p>Fayoka, who runs a family clinic and offers pre-natal testing, says the issues among the black African community are different from those in the gay community, and one of the key problems is transmission of HIV from mother to child. </p> <p>Kawonza says: \"Black African schoolchildren who contracted the disease at birth are now facing the stigma of HIV and being teased in the playground. They are terrified of talking to their friends.\" </p> <p>Themba agrees that answers need to come from within the black African community. \"We need an African solution to this problem,\" he says. \"By drawing together the most knowledgeable black African specialists, we can formulate a plan to approach our own people. We need to get the message across that the spread of HIV is a reality and we need to concentrate our efforts on prevention.\" </p> <p>Special report on HIV and Aids at <a href=\"http://www.SocietyGuardian.co.uk/hivaids/\">www.SocietyGuardian.co.uk/hivaids/</a></p>",

In 1996, heterosexual sex accounted for 29% of new reported infections; by 1999, it accounted for 49% of new reports. The increase is attributed largely to a growing number of reported cases among black Africans. The majority of HIV transmissions during pregnancy also occur among black African women. And most black Africans seek treatment only once they have symptoms of the disease. Pat Nair, consultant in communicable disease control with Bedfordshire health authority, will report to today's conference on a 200% increase in reports of HIV in Luton. Just over half of those affected were born in Zimbabwe and 86% had arrived in Britain since 1998. A representative from the Public Health Laboratory Service will highlight a study in Camden and Islington, north London, which found that 70% of 748 black African respondents did not use condoms with new sexual partners. Liza Kawonza, a Zimbabwean health promotion manager in Terrence Higgins Trust Lighthouse's African team, says: \"Within our community, because of religious and cultural beliefs, once you are known to be HIV positive you are no longer considered a human being.\" Themba (not his real name), a 40-year-old black African who is HIV positive, confirms this. \"I have lost most of my friends and my life has become much more narrow,\" he says. \"People still think they can be infected by coughing or sharing cutlery.\" He adds: \"There is a sense of shame around sex, and a belief that if you catch a disease it is from your own evil doings and you don't deserve support.\" Kawonza maintains that HIV is often associated by black Africans with promiscuity and homosexuality. \"This prejudice is based on ignorance which, through the campaign, we are hoping to show has parallels with racism,\" she says. The poster campaign will use familiar images of segregation in Africa to challenge black people's own prejudice towards HIV. Kawonza says the campaign is not concerned with talking about safe sex, or apportioning blame, but is about changing attitudes to make it more acceptable for people to talk about HIV and come forward for tests. If people could seek help earlier, she argues, they would be better able to take control of their treatment and live longer. The charity hopes its message will spread across Europe and Africa. It has been shown to African people at various stages of its development and the response is said to have been \"overwhelming\". Posters will be displayed in community centres, hairdressers, churches, bars and taxi offices. Themba, however, is sceptical about the campaign. He says: \"The stigma will not go away for a long time. The posters are about encouraging people not to be afraid to talk about HIV. People are not ready to do that. The few people who have come out as HIV positive have become superstars, and this deters other people from disclosing their status.\" He argues that the campaign should be about encouraging people to take diagnostic tests and assuring them of confidentiality. He is, however, more hopeful of a research forum which is also being launched at the conference. Ade Fakoya, a consultant specialising in HIV, will introduce the African research forum to delegates. Based at Newham General hospital, east London, he wants to draw together specialists and involve the black African community in planning research. Fayoka, who runs a family clinic and offers pre-natal testing, says the issues among the black African community are different from those in the gay community, and one of the key problems is transmission of HIV from mother to child. Kawonza says: \"Black African schoolchildren who contracted the disease at birth are now facing the stigma of HIV and being teased in the playground. They are terrified of talking to their friends.\" Themba agrees that answers need to come from within the black African community. \"We need an African solution to this problem,\" he says. \"By drawing together the most knowledgeable black African specialists, we can formulate a plan to approach our own people. We need to get the message across that the spread of HIV is a reality and we need to concentrate our efforts on prevention.\" Special report on HIV and Aids at www.SocietyGuardian.co.uk/hivaids/",

Disabled children, on the other hand, need the right wheelchair or mobility equipment to enable them to lead an independent life from a very young age right through to adulthood. It is an ongoing need. In the experience of Whizz-Kidz, parents are all too often thrown from pillar to post in their search to find \"essential\" equipment that meets their child's individual needs - and let's not forget the expense of it, too. Experiencing movement in their early years (0-4) is an essential stimuli to any child's critical growth period. Whizz-Kidz provides a large number of powered wheelchairs for children under five because the NHS rarely provides for them. Funding is tight in the NHS and criteria strict. Both are neglecting young disabled children and preventing them from getting the best possible start in life. Jill Cochrane Whizz-Kidz Smelling a rat Malcolm Dean is right to be concerned about the effects of a large part of social services being hived off to care trusts (Only fools and Trojan horses, February 14). But there are two he failed to mention. The civil liberty implications are particularly alarming: there are certain areas in which the power of the social worker has been explicitly designed to counterbalance the power of the doctor (and, in particular, the consultant). Mental health and hospital social work are only the most obvious examples. If everyone works for the same employer, the ability of a social worker to represent the interests of a client/patient against the doctor will be lost. It is also likely that a transfer to care trusts will seriously affect the pay and conditions of all care workers - as evidenced by recent examples in Hillingdon and Tameside. Privatisation by any other name smells just as bad. Mike Scott Branch organiser, Unison Nottinghamshire Pregnant pause \"With the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe . . . it is crucial that misconceptions do not shape the services for this important section of society,\" (Baby blues, February 14). Aren't most teenage pregnancies the result of \"misconceptions\"?

      "body": "<p>Stanislaw Stepien looks slightly surprised when I turn down his offer of another glass of vodka. It is late on a dark winter's afternoon and I have already accepted a good slug on top of a cup of tea and a ham sandwich. Politely, I hope, I have declined further offers of cake and apple pie. Even by Polish standards, the Stepiens are generous and hospitable people. Stanislaw tops up his own glass. Then, eyes twinkling mischievously beneath bushy eyebrows, he leans forward and says: \"In moderation, I can take plenty.\"</p> <p>He is a powerful-looking man with a military bearing. In his 89th year, he is still tilling a fertile acre of garden behind a semi on the edge of Bradford. His wife, Leonia, is 84 and slightly stooped, but just as full of fun. \"You can laugh; you can cry,\" she says at one point. And in the course of nearly three hours of conversation, she does both, occasionally dabbing her eyes with a neatly folded handkerchief.</p> <p>She talks with measured composure about wartime experiences of unimaginable cruelty and deprivation. Along with her first husband and his family, she was rounded up by Soviet troops and transported to Siberia in cattle-truck trains soon after Stanislaw and his comrades had fought a brave but doomed battle against the Nazi invaders from the west. Having survived the packed, freezing, insanitary trucks, she was put to work helping to fell trees in a forest. She worked for 12 hours at a time, up to her chest in snow. \"If you cried, the tears would freeze on your cheeks,\" she recalls. She drank melted snow. The brick-like bread she was given to sustain her had to be melted over pieces of burning wood.</p> <p>Leonia was freed after Hitler's armies invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. So began an epic journey, all the way down to the Caspian Sea, across to Tehran and then on to Palestine. From there, she was flown to Britain. Her first husband, Romuald, was killed in 1945 while flying a Lancaster bomber over German cities. She met Stanislaw after the war, in the Leicestershire town of Melton Mowbray.</p> <p> The remarkable thing about the Stepiens' story is that, in Polish terms, it is not particularly remarkable. Almost as remarkable is how little most of the indigenous British know about these stories. Large numbers of Poles have been living among us since the second world war. Over 160,000-strong at the time, they made up the biggest group of political exiles to settle here since 1918. Yet sometimes it seems that not much has changed since the 1950s when Leonia revealed to workmates at a Bradford textile mill a little about the appalling conditions she had endured in Siberia, and somebody asked her: \"Why didn't you write and complain to Stalin?\"</p> <p>Forty years on, the first generation of settlers are reaching an age when many of them need help from the caring services. Are those services geared up to cope with their special needs? They will be in Bradford, if Barbara Stepien-Foad, daughter of Stanislaw and Leonia, has anything to do with it. As social services development manager in the city's Shipley area, she is well aware that there are elderly Poles who are more isolated and more mentally scarred than her own sprightly parents.</p> <p>\"Yet our home-care people providing services in eastern European homes were finding clients very reluctant to ask for help,\" she says. \"They have always been self-reliant survivors. But they've carried what happened to them between 1939 and '45 into old age. In retirement they have more time to dwell on the past. Too often we are reaching them at a crisis point when what we really need is more preventative work. To give them appropriate help, though, we have to understand what they have lived through.\"</p> <p>Accordingly, she has set up a course to educate social workers and others on the culture and wartime history of Poles and other eastern Europeans. \"I'm not aware that other areas are doing what Bradford is doing, apart from Reading where Age Concern set up a similar scheme that has since collapsed because of lack of funding,\" says Michelle Winslow, co-author of a new book which should prove invaluable for those who want to know more. The book, Keeping the Faith: the Polish Community in Britain, provides an outline of how their country was carved up by invaders from the west and east, coupled with extracts from the personal stories of elderly Poles.</p> <p>Winslow took her tape recorder to centres all around the country. But many interviews were done in Bradford and her native Sheffield where she was, until comparatively recently, a state enrolled nurse. A career break led her to a history degree and a PhD on Polish migration to Britain. In the course of it, she became aware of the high incidence of mental health problems among immigrants from eastern Europe. As long ago as 1956, the rate was identified as four times higher than that of the indigenous population.</p> <p>The reasons are not difficult to discern, as Winslow points out. \"Apart from all the trauma they went through during the war, at the end of it they faced the crushing blow that they couldn't go back without risking death or arrest. They'd lost their families and their homeland. Meanwhile, Soviet propaganda had got through to some people here who were shouting 'fascist' at them in the street.\"</p> <p>The post-war Labour government was evidently not immune to Soviet propaganda either. Foreign secretary Ernest Bevin urged the Poles to return to their \"liberated country\" and, in order to appease Stalin, Polish servicemen were excluded from the London victory parade in 1946. Never mind that one in eight of the pilots who fought against the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain had been a Pole.</p> <p>It's hardly surprising that many survivors remain obsessed with the Second World War. It was that obsession that intrigued Tim Smith, a photographer with an interest in oral history, who provided the pictures for Winslow's book (of which he is the co-author) and carried out a few of the interviews. \"Many British people went through awful things during the war,\" he says, \"but at the end at least they knew they were on the winning side and they still had a homeland. The Poles had lost everything and had nowhere to go. No wonder they see it as the pivotal event of their lives.\"</p> <p>And no wonder it still haunts them in old age. \"I wanted to go back,\" says Stanislaw, \"but I knew friends who did and finished up in Siberia. I stayed in England because here I was free,\" he says, hammering the table with a heavy forefinger. \"I try to look forward rather than back,\" he goes on. \"Tomorrow is more important to me than yesterday - tomorrow when I know which seeds are going to come through in my garden.\"</p> <p>But he also knows that for himself, his wife and other elderly Poles, the horrors of yesterday retain an all too powerful grip on today.</p> <p>Keeping the Faith, The Polish Community in Britain, is published by the Bradford Heritage Recording Unit in association with the University of Sheffield at \u00a39.95. </p> <p><strong>Solid sense of community and pride</strong></p> <p>The vast majority of Poles who were to settle in Britain had already arrived by 1949. A Home Office report estimated the numbers to be some 162,000, the majority being former deportees to the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Most of those who settled in Britain were members of the Roman Catholic church, which, in many ways, has provided the background of the organised Polish community. Only 2% were Jewish and they tended to identify with Jewish organisations in this country.</p> <p>By 1960, there were about 150 Polish schools in Britain. The community also produced a wealth of publications. In the 1940s, the Dziennik Polski (Polish Daily) had a circulation of 35,000; today, the figure is nearer 7,000.</p> <p>Among the early settlers, men outnumbered women by a ratio of three to one, so there was a search for wives outside the community. Marriages between Polish and Italian immigrants were quite common.</p> <p>The election of the first Polish pope, the rise of Solidarity (driving force behind the independence movement in Poland) and the downfall of communism all played a part in reviving a sense of pride in Polish roots among the second and third generations.</p> <p>The original settlers kept alive the belief that one day they would return to an independent Poland. But relatively few lived long enough to see the collapse of communism and the election of Lech Walesa (left) as president in 1990.</p> <p>Many of those who did outlive communist rule have returned on nostalgic and often painful journeys. For the majority, their former homes now lie in Ukraine, Belarus or Lithuania, and the Poland of a new millennium is not the place of idealised childhood memories. Few have gone back to live there permanently.</p>",

It was that obsession that intrigued Tim Smith, a photographer with an interest in oral history, who provided the pictures for Winslow's book (of which he is the co-author) and carried out a few of the interviews. \"Many British people went through awful things during the war,\" he says, \"but at the end at least they knew they were on the winning side and they still had a homeland. The Poles had lost everything and had nowhere to go. No wonder they see it as the pivotal event of their lives.\" And no wonder it still haunts them in old age. \"I wanted to go back,\" says Stanislaw, \"but I knew friends who did and finished up in Siberia. I stayed in England because here I was free,\" he says, hammering the table with a heavy forefinger. \"I try to look forward rather than back,\" he goes on. \"Tomorrow is more important to me than yesterday - tomorrow when I know which seeds are going to come through in my garden.\" But he also knows that for himself, his wife and other elderly Poles, the horrors of yesterday retain an all too powerful grip on today. Keeping the Faith, The Polish Community in Britain, is published by the Bradford Heritage Recording Unit in association with the University of Sheffield at \u00a39.95. Solid sense of community and pride The vast majority of Poles who were to settle in Britain had already arrived by 1949. A Home Office report estimated the numbers to be some 162,000, the majority being former deportees to the Soviet Union. Most of those who settled in Britain were members of the Roman Catholic church, which, in many ways, has provided the background of the organised Polish community. Only 2% were Jewish and they tended to identify with Jewish organisations in this country. By 1960, there were about 150 Polish schools in Britain. The community also produced a wealth of publications. In the 1940s, the Dziennik Polski (Polish Daily) had a circulation of 35,000; today, the figure is nearer 7,000. Among the early settlers, men outnumbered women by a ratio of three to one, so there was a search for wives outside the community. Marriages between Polish and Italian immigrants were quite common. The election of the first Polish pope, the rise of Solidarity (driving force behind the independence movement in Poland) and the downfall of communism all played a part in reviving a sense of pride in Polish roots among the second and third generations. The original settlers kept alive the belief that one day they would return to an independent Poland. But relatively few lived long enough to see the collapse of communism and the election of Lech Walesa (left) as president in 1990. Many of those who did outlive communist rule have returned on nostalgic and often painful journeys. For the majority, their former homes now lie in Ukraine, Belarus or Lithuania, and the Poland of a new millennium is not the place of idealised childhood memories. Few have gone back to live there permanently.",

Pharaoh's Palace, a casino with 2,500 slot machines, 70 gaming tables and a 500 bed hotel, designed on an Egyptian theme complete with kitsch sphinxes, is planned to occupy the site of the former Central railway station.

It is easy to see why the proposals - tabled by Leisure Parcs, the company which owns and runs Blackpool's landmark attractions of the Tower, the Winter Garden and the piers, and backed by Blackpool challenge partnership - are being advanced as the resort's best chance of an assured prosperous future. For while the town is still the top seaside resort, with 12m visitors annually, this has dropped 30% since the mid-90s.

Their views will be fed into a submission that challenge partnership will make to the government's gambling review body. This was set up by home secretary, Jack Straw, under the chairmanship of Sir Alan Budd, to make recommendations on future regulation of the industry. It is expected to report to Straw in the summer.</p> <p>The second bet is that the review body will back an easing of the rules (at present, only 10 slot machines per casino, with a maximum \u00a310,000 jackpot, are allowed), thereby opening the door for resort hotels.</p> <p>The third (where the odds are trickiest to call) is that the government, aware of the problems of struggling seaside towns, would be willing to reform the law so that part of the tax on casinos could be earmarked for a regeneration fund.</p> <p>This radical element has been included in Leisure Parcs' plans by its director, Marc Etches. He has borrowed the idea from Atlantic City, the US resort which he sees as a paradigm for Blackpool.

It would mean getting ministers to change primary legislation and to put into practice the controversial idea of hypothecation of taxes. There is a precedent, he points out, as ground improvements at soccer clubs are in part financed from tax on football pools.

Terrence Higgins Trust Lighthouse is seeking to curb the rapid increase in HIV infection in the African community, which has emerged as the most pressing concern among those working to combat the disease.

      "body": "<p>Lenders and private sector developers have shied away from government plans to provide affordable homes for teachers, nurses and police officers in London and the south-east. And the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) and the Home Office have failed to stump up any extra cash for the \u00a3250m starter homes initiative.</p> <p>In spite of hopes that interest-free loans and cash deposits of up to \u00a325,000 to help key workers purchase homes would be available from building societies, developers and employers under the initiative, there was little expectation that lenders would be among those who submitted bids this week to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), and the Housing Corporation.</p> <p>Peter Williams, deputy director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, says that routing the scheme through local authorities has deterred members from participating. \"Two or three major lenders were very keen to participate. One option was to run the Homebuy scheme [providing interest free equity loans] through lenders rather than registered social landlords. After all, if someone wants to buy a home they are more likely to approach a bank or building society. But it's not feasible under local authority control.\"</p> <p>Another option to provide lower rate mortgages to key workers was also ruled out as non-viable. This could be done only under a national scheme, says Williams; not by a one limited to helping only 10,000 employees get a foot on the housing ladder.</p> <p>Richard McCarthy, chief executive of the Peabody Trust, which has submitted a bid in partnership with the NHS to provide equity loans on 100 homes for NHS employees, agrees that the heavy focus on local authorities was a problem. \"They see the programme as theirs to control, and a way to house their own teachers and social workers.\" </p> <p>The House Builders Federation criticised the initiative for failing to tackle the cause of the problem: too many people chasing too few properties. \"The reason why too few homes are built is because under-funded LAs are pushing for more and more planning gain requirements, including affordable homes, from developers, in exchange for planning permission. </p> <p>\"It would be fine if there was sufficient public subsidy to make this economically viable. But developers cannot be expected to take on loss-making projects,\" says an HBF spokesman. </p> <p>Public sector employers are thought to have steered clear of giving workers top-ups in their pay packets to cover housing costs, fearing that the cash would be clawed back by the Inland Revenue. </p> <p>The majority of the bids were submitted by councils and housing associations. They are an extension of shared ownership schemes that allow house buyers to purchase part of a property, and rent the rest from a social landlord.</p> <p>Others, such as the Peabody scheme, and a plan to provide flats for teachers and police above a Sainsbury's supermarket in Lambeth, propose interest-free equity loans - covering a percentage of a property's value - which are repaid when the home owner moves on. </p> <p>Launching the scheme last December, housing minister Nick Raynsford said its success might depend on private companies providing subsidies to match government cash. A DETR spokeswoman says the tight bidding period, coupled with social landlords' experience in this field, was the reason why they had submitted the majority of the bids. \"It is important that bids have the support of local authorities because the homes provided have to be an integral part of their strategies to meet housing need.\" </p> <p>The Greater London Authority acknowledges that low wages price people out of the capital's housing market. It called for London weighting to be reviewed, for the first time in 27 years, in its report on key workers launched yesterday. The GLA report, which extends the definition of key workers to include bus drivers, also recommends partnerships between housing associations, lenders and employers.

      "bodyText": "Lenders and private sector developers have shied away from government plans to provide affordable homes for teachers, nurses and police officers in London and the south-east. And the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) and the Home Office have failed to stump up any extra cash for the \u00a3250m starter homes initiative. In spite of hopes that interest-free loans and cash deposits of up to \u00a325,000 to help key workers purchase homes would be available from building societies, developers and employers under the initiative, there was little expectation that lenders would be among those who submitted bids this week to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), and the Housing Corporation. Peter Williams, deputy director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, says that routing the scheme through local authorities has deterred members from participating. \"Two or three major lenders were very keen to participate. One option was to run the Homebuy scheme [providing interest free equity loans] through lenders rather than registered social landlords. After all, if someone wants to buy a home they are more likely to approach a bank or building society. But it's not feasible under local authority control.\" Another option to provide lower rate mortgages to key workers was also ruled out as non-viable. This could be done only under a national scheme, says Williams; not by a one limited to helping only 10,000 employees get a foot on the housing ladder. Richard McCarthy, chief executive of the Peabody Trust, which has submitted a bid in partnership with the NHS to provide equity loans on 100 homes for NHS employees, agrees that the heavy focus on local authorities was a problem. \"They see the programme as theirs to control, and a way to house their own teachers and social workers.\" The House Builders Federation criticised the initiative for failing to tackle the cause of the problem: too many people chasing too few properties. \"The reason why too few homes are built is because under-funded LAs are pushing for more and more planning gain requirements, including affordable homes, from developers, in exchange for planning permission. \"It would be fine if there was sufficient public subsidy to make this economically viable. But developers cannot be expected to take on loss-making projects,\" says an HBF spokesman. Public sector employers are thought to have steered clear of giving workers top-ups in their pay packets to cover housing costs, fearing that the cash would be clawed back by the Inland Revenue. The majority of the bids were submitted by councils and housing associations. They are an extension of shared ownership schemes that allow house buyers to purchase part of a property, and rent the rest from a social landlord. Others, such as the Peabody scheme, and a plan to provide flats for teachers and police above a Sainsbury's supermarket in Lambeth, propose interest-free equity loans - covering a percentage of a property's value - which are repaid when the home owner moves on. Launching the scheme last December, housing minister Nick Raynsford said its success might depend on private companies providing subsidies to match government cash. A DETR spokeswoman says the tight bidding period, coupled with social landlords' experience in this field, was the reason why they had submitted the majority of the bids. \"It is important that bids have the support of local authorities because the homes provided have to be an integral part of their strategies to meet housing need.\" The Greater London Authority acknowledges that low wages price people out of the capital's housing market. It called for London weighting to be reviewed, for the first time in 27 years, in its report on key workers launched yesterday. The GLA report, which extends the definition of key workers to include bus drivers, also recommends partnerships between housing associations, lenders and employers. It suggests employers do more to recruit older people, people from ethnic minority backgrounds, non-working parents and skilled refugees already living in London. It says the starter homes initiative provides an \"important, if limited funding contribution\", but it wants public subsidy - currently limited to \u00a325,000 per property - to be relaxed so that family-sized homes could be included.

The fall of European communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union led to hopes of an end to the cloak-and-dagger era, but Russia remains suspicious about an array of security issues. The US and Russia have taken the occasional spy scandal in their stride. However, the Hanssen spy scandal comes at a particularly low point in relations between Washington and Moscow. President Bush has come to power with an entourage of veteran cold warriors who believe Russia should be treated as a strategic rival rather than a partner. The new defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, in particular, believes the US should pursue its plans to construct a missile shield system, NMD, irrespective of Russian concerns. The new administration is also strongly in favour of Nato expansion into the Baltic states, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, a move which Russia views with considerable alarm. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, a KGB veteran, is campaigning hard against NMD, which he portrays as a destabilising and hostile development, and the Russian military has threatened to equip its upgraded Topol intercontinental ballistic missile with multiple warheads designed to confuse the NMD's anti-ballistic system. \"Espionage didn't fall with the [Berlin] Wall,\" said security expert Frank Cilluffo of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The US maintains its interest in keeping tabs on the military, political and economic activities of other nations. \"Russia still has the capacity to destroy the United States in 30 minutes, so that focuses the attention, even though the prospects of that are minimal in the near term,\" said Loch Johnson, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia. Foreign intelligence activities never seem to have flagged under former President Boris Yeltsin, and some analysts have predicted they would increase under his successor Vladimir Putin. Mr Yeltsin split the KGB into several smaller agencies, but the security apparatus seems to have remained mighty. Russia's intense interest in learning the secrets of the wealthy and technically sophisticated west were underlined by the arrest of Robert Hanssen on charges of spying for Russia, the latest in an unusually heavy flurry of espionage cases over the past year and a half. Russia, once proud of how it sped from the serf age to the space age in less than a century, now appears to feel vulnerable because it is behind the technological wave. Hanssen was reportedly passing on unspecified information about US electronic surveillance techniques. Western technological sophistication has made many other countries besides Russia nervous, particularly over the Echelon surveillance network, allegedly run by the US National Security Agency, which reportedly intercepts telephone calls, fax transmissions and private emails. Moscow, meanwhile, says foreign intelligence agents have stepped up their work in Russia. Spy wars 1994 Aldrich Ames, a CIA officer, is jailed for life after admitting spying for Moscow.

      "body": "<p>Nicol Williamson was once a powerfully rebarbative presence in Shakespeare, Osborne and Beckett. Terry Hands is a world-class director. Put the two together, and you expect something memorable. But, although this Lear has a stunning visual clarity, Williamson's performance as yet lacks definition; at the late preview I saw, he was too busy searching for the lines to be fully inside the character. </p> <p>Williamson has one quality vital for Lear: authority. He has height, presence, an explosive unpredictability. In the first scene, things look promising as he treats the division of the kingdom as a mad, capricious game. But we are told that Lear \"hath ever but slenderly known himself\", and here the same applies to his lines. </p> <p>Williamson is marvellous at moments: he is vindictively ironic at learning of the \"fiery\" quality of the Duke of Cornwall and, when he tells his daughters \"I gave you all\", he invests the lines with a heartbroken disbelief at filial ingratitude. But, as Hazlitt said of Edmund Kean's Lear, \"he chips a bit off the character here and there\".

      "bodyText": "Nicol Williamson was once a powerfully rebarbative presence in Shakespeare, Osborne and Beckett. Terry Hands is a world-class director. Put the two together, and you expect something memorable. But, although this Lear has a stunning visual clarity, Williamson's performance as yet lacks definition; at the late preview I saw, he was too busy searching for the lines to be fully inside the character. Williamson has one quality vital for Lear: authority. He has height, presence, an explosive unpredictability. In the first scene, things look promising as he treats the division of the kingdom as a mad, capricious game. But we are told that Lear \"hath ever but slenderly known himself\", and here the same applies to his lines. Williamson is marvellous at moments: he is vindictively ironic at learning of the \"fiery\" quality of the Duke of Cornwall and, when he tells his daughters \"I gave you all\", he invests the lines with a heartbroken disbelief at filial ingratitude. But, as Hazlitt said of Edmund Kean's Lear, \"he chips a bit off the character here and there\". When it comes to the great tirades, such as the curse of sterility on Goneril, Williamson runs out of verbal and emotional steam. The pity of it is that Hands has created a framework for a great performance that never quite arrives. Indeed, in terms of staging, this is one of the best Lears in years. The opening, in particular, is mesmerising: Siwan Morris's Cordelia enters alone in a spirit of serene happiness and greets the arriving courtiers with an unaffected gaiety, soon to be fractured.

Debt interest payments and social security payments are undershooting, but it never harmed a chancellor to stand up on Budget day and announce that because unemployment is lower than forecast, there is more money for health and education. </p> <p>The embarrassing statistics are the figures for investment. With just two months of the fiscal year to go, the government has spent only \u00a32.2bn renewing the public infrastructure - more than last year's miserly \u00a31.4bn - but well short of Mr Brown's aim of \u00a37bn. In three months of the financial year, the public sector disinvested - it spent less than the depreciation costs. </p> <p>The trouble is that the last time the public sector was allowed to spend anything like \u00a37bn on investment was 1995-96.

That, by the way, is more than 30 times last year's revenues from Infostrada. </p> <p>Such comparisons might be thought invidious. Despite recent reservations the internet is all about future prospects and companies are priced accordingly. The steel industry, especially in Europe, comes heavily burdened by a past where the politics of employment have often diluted the disciplines of the market. Such excitement as the merger generated came from the likelihood of further cuts in Europe's steel making capacity with a (hoped-for) knock on effect on prices. </p> <p>Yet, whatever the promise of the internet and the problems of the steel industry, it is surely a matter of concern that the value investors attach to an enter prise which represents the livelihoods of more than 100,000 people is, in stock market terms, not that much more than loose change. </p> <p><strong> Byers beware </strong><br> </p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, is due to rule on whether Lloyds TSB's \u00a319bn bid for Abbey National should be subjected to a competition inquiry by the end of the week.

It is lunchtime and Ian Plenderleith is explaining how the Bank of England has become the bank that loves to listen. As the coffee cups clink, the intricacies of monetary policy are revealed to the Bath chamber of commerce. </p> <p>For Plenderleith, it is the chance both to take the pulse of the regions and to lay an old ghost to rest. While the main purpose of his visit is to gather information first-hand, it is hard for a lifelong Bank official to forget that it was behind the elegant frontage of the Royal Crescent hotel that one of the more inglorious episodes in Britain's recent economic history was played out. The \"forces of darkness\", as Plenderleith calls them, were gathering over sterling in early September 1992 when Europe's finance ministers and central bank governors convened at the hotel and rejected Norman Lamont's plea to save John Major's government from a humiliating devaluation. It was in Bath that the clock started ticking down remorselessly towards Black Wednesday four days later. </p> <p><strong> Sign of the times</strong><br> </p> <p> Times have changed. Today the Bank will release minutes of its meeting earlier this month at which interest rates were cut from 6% to 5.75%. On September 16 1992, they were raised twice, to 15%, even though Plenderleith, along with every other official at the Bank, knew that the game was up. </p> <p>As the official who called Denis Healey back from Heathrow airport during the sterling crisis in 1976, he had been there before. But today, Bath's prosperity is evidence of almost nine years of uninterrupted growth. The days of full employment are back and Plenderleith wants to know whether strong growth means higher inflation. </p> <p>As the Bank official in charge of foreign exchange markets at the time of Black Wednesday, Plenderleith is aware of the change in the economic weather. Not that he was actually in Bath for Lamont's last stand. As a cricket fanatic, he was at Lord's watching the NatWest final and trying to avoid catching the eye of one of the other guests in the executive box, one John Major. </p> <p>Today, the Bank's director in charge of markets can joke that Black Wednesday witnessed \"one of the least appreciated pieces of financial diplomacy\", but that was not how it seemed at the time. </p> <p>Moreover, without the activities of George Soros and his speculator chums, Plenderleith would almost certainly not be on a whistle-stop overnight tour of Bristol and Bath, chewing the fat with the area's business elite, but back in his office in Threadneedle Street sizing up the impact of the likely cut in US interest rates. A new monetary framework was hurriedly put into place following Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism, and this structure was refined in 1997 when the newly elected Labour government gave the Bank the freedom to set interest rates. Under the new arrangement, Gordon Brown set up a nine-strong monetary policy committee, consisting of five full-time Bank officials - including Plenderleith - and four outside experts. </p> <p>As part of the process, MPC members make regular visits to explain their thinking and find out what is going on outside the M25. There are times when this can backfire. Sir Eddie George, the Bank's governor, was once sandbagged on a visit to the north, but the Bank is anxious to tackle head-on the idea that the MPC takes no heed of the needs of the regions, particularly the impact of the strong pound on manufacturing. At each MPC meeting one of the Bank's agents gives a presentation on how life looks from the regions. </p> <p>Plenderleith explains to his dinner guests at the Bank's office in Bristol: \"We have a mandate to hit the government's inflation target of 2.5%. But as part of that we have a duty to take account of regional variations. That's important. There are differences across the country. We can't juggle all of those, but we need to get a picture of the UK as a whole.\" He says that the MPC has three main sources of information - hard economic data, the signals from the financial markets and the direct evidence it receives from business surveys, reports from Bank agents and personal visits by committee members. </p> <p>According to Plenderleith, his visit is a two-way process - he explains what the Bank is up to and businesses explain what life is like for them. </p> <p>The message from the west country is upbeat, although some firms complain of \"profitless prosperity\", where intense competition means that increased activity is not showing up in the bottom line. Almost universally, firms are looking for ways to cope with a shortage of labour - either through automation or by increasing output per worker. </p> <p>But as Plenderleith readily admits, it is a moot point whether Bristol and Bath are really part of the south-west or part of an outpost of the booming south-east. Prosperity has travelled westwards down the hi-tech M4 corridor, so that neither city is typical of the south-west. </p> <p>Bristol has a pocket of high unemployment in the south of the city, but the fact that BAE Systems is employing engineers from China tells its own story. There is no shortage of jobs and the Bank's agent for the region, John Beverly, says that more and more of the 500 firms he is in regular contact with are starting to report skill shortages. </p> <p><strong> Tough call</strong><br> </p> <p> The next meeting of the MPC is a week away, and Plenderleith tells the Bath chamber that the decision on rates will be a tough call, with the strength of the domestic economy counter-balanced by the gloomy news from overseas. \"It is the story of two shifting scenes superimposed on each other. In the UK the picture is of reasonably steady growth; in the US the economy slowed rapidly in the final quarter of last year. The MPC has shifted. There has been a sensible shift in the balance of risks from the possibility that we might need to restrain the economy a bit more to the possibility that we are going to get a weaker performance than we would like. I have only one vote and I have no idea how I am going to cast it.\" </p> <p>Asked what he has learnt from 24 hours in Bristol and Bath, Plenderleith says: \"It is interesting how they are dealing with supply constraints and focusing on efficiency gains. Businesses were not thinking of bidding up the price of labour. It is the first time I have heard people say that the exchange rate has ceased to be an issue for them. That is partly because it has come back from its previous levels, but also because firms have adjusted. It's not universal but if you are getting it here [in Bristol and Bath], it may be true elsewhere.\" </p> <p>And what does the Bath chamber of commerce make of the man from the MPC? Hard to say. By the time Plenderleith is preparing to depart for a firm making hi-tech valves, the chairman is already on to the next business - the forthcoming pub triathlon of darts, skittles and shove ha'penny.</p>",
