Should a publisher circulate or incinerate the racist journals of one of its best-selling authors? In the real world you feel that, if the journals were any good, they would publish and be damned: the one thing they wouldn't do is destroy them. </p> <p>All Hutchinson's premises seem a little shaky. He posits the idea of a writer, Edward Mallowan, who has created a twelve-novel sequence exploring the moral issues of the modern world; not least what to do with the paintings the Nazis labelled degenerate. </p> <p>The man is a potential Nobel candidate, attracts correspondence from the world's greatest writers and is a northern recluse who has kept his private journals hidden from his tame academic biographer. Suddenly, for no clear reason, Mallowan not only wants his journals published but threatens to take his new novel elsewhere if they're not. </p> <p>Think Philip Larkin, whose name is naturally invoked, and you begin to see the falsity of the dilemmas. The Little Englandism of Larkin's letters, which were of course published, is deducible from his poetry and journalism; in Mallowan's case there seems a ludicrous chasm between the sensitivity of his fiction and the banal racism of his journals. As the play proceeds, the false choices proliferate. </p> <p>At one point Neil, a pragmatic Scot who wants to destroy the diaries, asks Richter, the publishing house's brash American owner, what he would have done if in 1925 he had possessed the sole copy of Mein Kampf: the implication is that, by destroying it, he could have saved the lives of 6m Jews. The reality is that the book was so turgidly written it was scarcely read even by dedicated Nazis. </p> <p>Even Mallowan's frontal attack on his biographer, though amusingly written, seems wide of the mark. You can argue, as Scott Fitzgerald did, that a biography of a novelist is inherently impossible: \"he's too many people if he's any good\". But Mallowan's line that biography is generally conceived in sullen hate just seems sour grapes. </p> <p>Where Hutchinson comes closer to truth is in his portrayal of the fractious nature of modern publishing. In Denis Lawson's production, roving between London, Manchester and Tuscany, there are sparky exchanges between John Gordon-Sinclair's incendiary Neil, Miranda Pleasence's author-defending editor and Rob Spendlove's wiry American owner. Kenneth Colley also has the right solitary grumpiness as the morose Mallowan. But it seems a pity that this unfocused debate about literary ethics has been given London exposure at the expense of Ben Brown's Larkin with Women, seen in Scarborough last year, which examined a real writer's life with exemplary sensitivity. </p> <p>Until June 3.

      "bodyText": "I am all for plays about moral issues. The problem with Ron Hutchinson's new work, however, is that the central dilemma carries little conviction. Should a publisher circulate or incinerate the racist journals of one of its best-selling authors? In the real world you feel that, if the journals were any good, they would publish and be damned: the one thing they wouldn't do is destroy them. All Hutchinson's premises seem a little shaky. He posits the idea of a writer, Edward Mallowan, who has created a twelve-novel sequence exploring the moral issues of the modern world; not least what to do with the paintings the Nazis labelled degenerate. The man is a potential Nobel candidate, attracts correspondence from the world's greatest writers and is a northern recluse who has kept his private journals hidden from his tame academic biographer. Suddenly, for no clear reason, Mallowan not only wants his journals published but threatens to take his new novel elsewhere if they're not. Think Philip Larkin, whose name is naturally invoked, and you begin to see the falsity of the dilemmas. The Little Englandism of Larkin's letters, which were of course published, is deducible from his poetry and journalism; in Mallowan's case there seems a ludicrous chasm between the sensitivity of his fiction and the banal racism of his journals. As the play proceeds, the false choices proliferate. At one point Neil, a pragmatic Scot who wants to destroy the diaries, asks Richter, the publishing house's brash American owner, what he would have done if in 1925 he had possessed the sole copy of Mein Kampf: the implication is that, by destroying it, he could have saved the lives of 6m Jews. The reality is that the book was so turgidly written it was scarcely read even by dedicated Nazis. Even Mallowan's frontal attack on his biographer, though amusingly written, seems wide of the mark. You can argue, as Scott Fitzgerald did, that a biography of a novelist is inherently impossible: \"he's too many people if he's any good\". But Mallowan's line that biography is generally conceived in sullen hate just seems sour grapes. Where Hutchinson comes closer to truth is in his portrayal of the fractious nature of modern publishing. In Denis Lawson's production, roving between London, Manchester and Tuscany, there are sparky exchanges between John Gordon-Sinclair's incendiary Neil, Miranda Pleasence's author-defending editor and Rob Spendlove's wiry American owner. Kenneth Colley also has the right solitary grumpiness as the morose Mallowan. But it seems a pity that this unfocused debate about literary ethics has been given London exposure at the expense of Ben Brown's Larkin with Women, seen in Scarborough last year, which examined a real writer's life with exemplary sensitivity. Until June 3. Box office: 020-7722 9301.",

While acknowledging that the weakness of investment intentions may reflect unrealistically high expectations of profits, Mr Reilly said there were also strong external pressures on manufacturers. \"It is hard to justify long term investment in an environment where manufacturers' efforts to improve productivity are easily outweighed by an increasing tax burden, higher interest rates and higher exchange rates. \"This reluctance to invest is worrying for the future of our manufacturing base, even if sterling falls from recent highs. Everyone who has an impact on manufacturing must take account of the strong messages in this survey and take appropriate action to help get through this difficult period. \"There is now an opportunity for the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold, indicating that they peaked and encouraging a decline in the exchange rate. With few signs of inflation across the economy in general, the MPC has little justification for doing anything else.\" He said the government should look at ways of reducing the corporate tax burden and consider investment allowances for large firms. A Treasury spokeswoman said: \"We are concerned if there is evidence that confidence is falling but it's important to get these issues into perspective. We have macro economic stability, low inflation and total business investment is very high - it's an excellent environment for growth.\"",

Lawrie McMenemy, McIlroy's predecessor, omitted Taggart for disciplinary reasons after the friendly with Spain in Santander in June 1998. \"It would be naive to say nothing happened but football is all about learning and I appreciate the lessons,\" said Taggart, 29. \"However, it was frustrating missing out for so long. Indeed, if Sammy McIlroy had not been appointed my international career might have ended. The choice would have been mine.\" Northern Ireland (probable, 4-4-2): Taylor (Fulham); Griffin (St Johnstone), A Hughes (Newcastle), Taggart (Leicester), Nolan (Sheffield Wednesday); Gillespie (Blackburn) or Johnson (Blackburn), Lennon (Leicester), Sonner (Sheffield Wednesday), M Hughes (Wimbledon); Kirk (Hearts), Healy (Manchester United). Hungary (probable, 4-3-3): Kiraly; Feher, Sedok, Hrutka, Matyus; Peto, Halmai, Lendvai; Lisztes, Illes, Derdai. Referee: C Richards (Wales).",

      "body": "<p>There is a local condition known as play-off-itis and the Suffolk medical authorities are bracing themselves for a rash of new complaints should Ipswich have to endure the end-of-season lottery for a fourth successive year. </p> <p>Victory last night, as David Johnson moved to 20 goals for the campaign, improved their chances of taking the automatic promotion place behind Charlton, but Portman Road senses that they are going to have to try and do it the hard way once again. </p> <p>The failure to build on Johnson's 26th-minute drive added to the anxiety because sporadically Crystal Palace were able to demonstrate pace on the break to worry George Burley's defence. The London club still need one more win to guarantee their safety, but it looks assured. </p> <p>Defeat against QPR had severely damaged Ipswich's cause and left them looking to Manchester City to show their fallibility. Maybe City's generosity in allowing Portsmouth to retrieve a two-goal deficit on Monday could yet prove crucial because Joe Royle's team have a harder two games with which to finish. </p> <p>Ipswich needed something to happen early if Portman Road's April neurosis was not to take hold again. A couple of headers softened up Palace for a long night on the retreat.

      "bodyText": "There is a local condition known as play-off-itis and the Suffolk medical authorities are bracing themselves for a rash of new complaints should Ipswich have to endure the end-of-season lottery for a fourth successive year. Victory last night, as David Johnson moved to 20 goals for the campaign, improved their chances of taking the automatic promotion place behind Charlton, but Portman Road senses that they are going to have to try and do it the hard way once again. The failure to build on Johnson's 26th-minute drive added to the anxiety because sporadically Crystal Palace were able to demonstrate pace on the break to worry George Burley's defence. The London club still need one more win to guarantee their safety, but it looks assured. Defeat against QPR had severely damaged Ipswich's cause and left them looking to Manchester City to show their fallibility. Maybe City's generosity in allowing Portsmouth to retrieve a two-goal deficit on Monday could yet prove crucial because Joe Royle's team have a harder two games with which to finish. Ipswich needed something to happen early if Portman Road's April neurosis was not to take hold again. A couple of headers softened up Palace for a long night on the retreat. Johnson, off-balance, then got under his shot after James Scowcroft had nipped in ahead of Matt Gregg. Burley had restored the Dutch midfielder Martijn Reuser to his side after impressing in the second half at Loftus Road and he added some quality touches to the central areas.

After the first two tests between the countries had been drawn, and after England's coach David Lloyd had uttered his infamous \"we flippin' murdered 'em\" line, Zimbabwe swept to a 3-0 win in the one-day series, with Brandes taking his hat-trick and knocking over the entire England top five in the third match. </p> <p>He is now 37, but though he may be gone from international cricket he is far from forgotten. \"Yeah, I'm still here: can't you hear the chickens?\" he said in that strangely cheerful tone the human voice defaults to when adversity strikes. </p> <p>The boast on a T-shirt worn as a badge of honour by Zimbabwean cricket folk is \"This is what we call murder\". It features a caricature of Brandes gleefully holding aloft a plucked chicken in each hand. One of the chickens has a picture of Michael Atherton as its head and the other an image of Lloyd. </p> <p>Then came the violent farm invasions by self-styled veterans of Zimbabwe's liberation struggle and the words on the T-shirt took on an ominous significance. </p> <p>Would Brandes be abandoning his farm to the invaders, like many other farmers? \"Nah, I don't think so,\" he said. \"You know, you can't just up sticks when you're talking about a business. </p> <p>\"We haven't had any real trouble yet but it has been a bit scary at times. But we're all in this together and we have to find a solution, which we have started negotiating towards.\" </p> <p>He added, less confidently, that he \"really can't talk about this\" in case his comments are seen as anti-patriotic by the Zimbabwean authorities.

      "bodyText": "As the Zimbabwe team arrived yesterday for their first tour of Britain, Eddo Brandes, the chicken farmer who found fame by taking a one-day international hat-trick against England, was back at home on his farm 15 miles from Harare, caught in the crossfire of what threatens to be a bloody civil war. Brandes pricked the pomposity of English cricket three years ago. After the first two tests between the countries had been drawn, and after England's coach David Lloyd had uttered his infamous \"we flippin' murdered 'em\" line, Zimbabwe swept to a 3-0 win in the one-day series, with Brandes taking his hat-trick and knocking over the entire England top five in the third match. He is now 37, but though he may be gone from international cricket he is far from forgotten. \"Yeah, I'm still here: can't you hear the chickens?\" he said in that strangely cheerful tone the human voice defaults to when adversity strikes. The boast on a T-shirt worn as a badge of honour by Zimbabwean cricket folk is \"This is what we call murder\". It features a caricature of Brandes gleefully holding aloft a plucked chicken in each hand. One of the chickens has a picture of Michael Atherton as its head and the other an image of Lloyd. Then came the violent farm invasions by self-styled veterans of Zimbabwe's liberation struggle and the words on the T-shirt took on an ominous significance. Would Brandes be abandoning his farm to the invaders, like many other farmers? \"Nah, I don't think so,\" he said. \"You know, you can't just up sticks when you're talking about a business. \"We haven't had any real trouble yet but it has been a bit scary at times. But we're all in this together and we have to find a solution, which we have started negotiating towards.\" He added, less confidently, that he \"really can't talk about this\" in case his comments are seen as anti-patriotic by the Zimbabwean authorities. Merely attending an opposition party meeting is regarded as treasonous by Robert Mugabe's police. \"They're blaming everyone now, and safety is of paramount importance,\" Brandes added. From his cattle and game ranch 45 miles north of Bulawayo the gentlemanly Denis Streak, the ever restrained father of the strapping perennial spearhead of the Zimbabwean attack Heath Streak, is also cagey. \"It hasn't been very pleasant, you feel defenceless, but we've got a very good police force here,\" he said hopefully, adding that he had managed to placate the \"20 or so\" invaders who had arrived at his gates last week. That said, Streak Jr's departure for England was delayed by the crisis. \"We needed to sort things out in case something goes drastically wrong while he is away,\" said his father. \"I want his mind to be on cricket, not on what's happening at home.\"",

So the impending withdrawal of BMW and Ford from mass car production in Britain could prove to be a turning point for the unions , in which they are forced, finally, to acknowledge just how little power they possess to carry out their primary function as the defenders of their members' livelihoods. It is true that strike action has a certain muscular resonance, recalling the years of union militancy when shop stewards were the lords of creation and most managers cringed at the sight of a union card.

It is at this point that many union members must be beginning to think not just about the sort of questions that exercised George Woodcock, but also about the hitherto taboo subject of the relationship between the trades unions and the Labour party. For there is an obvious question which has hung over New Labour ever since its birth, and it is this: if we can't rely on the Labour government to protect our most vital interests - namely, the jobs of our members - why do we give them all that money? Ironically, it was New Labour itself which first raised the question of whether this long-standing alliance had any further justification.

Here, less than 200 years ago, millions of young west Africans were manacled and shipped to Cuba and the Americas, consigned to early death, their communities and families divided and crushed.</p> <p>Goree is now a moving shrine to the African diaspora and over the next few days most of the 500 world leaders from 181 countries gathering three miles away in Dakar will visit the island to condemn slavery - even as they effectively chain hundreds of millions of the poorest children to lifetimes of ignorance and permanent disadvantage.</p> <p>The United Nations' World Education Forum - the equivalent of the earth summit for education - opens today at the five star Meridien hotel in Dakar. Set behind huge walls far from the city's slums and pollution, the Meridien this week whiffs of complacency, abject failure and broken promises.</p> <p>The same UN bodies, the same governments and the same global financial institutions that 10 years ago in Thailand pledged to provide primary schooling for all by the year 2000, are in Dakar having failed to keep their promises.</p> <p>Today, 125m children have never seen the inside of a school. Another 150m have been forced to drop out of education in the past decade before they could even read or write. Meanwhile, 880m adults are illiterate and few governments or world bodies will admit there is even a crisis.</p> <p>There have been advances, especially in Asia, but the situation now is being likened by charities and grassroots groups to 19th century slavery, with governments deliberately seeking to deprive the poorest of education.</p> <p>Across the world, schools are roofless, teachers have no materials and the poorest parents are being expected to pay for the most basic schooling.</p> <p>During the next three days, the leaders of all the main UN agencies - including the secretary general, Kofi Annan - the 181 government delegations, the head of the World Bank and other global financial institutions, together with Nelson Mandela, Nobel prize winners and other statesman, will hum and haw, hold workshops and plenary sessions and are expected to reaffirm education as a human right and pledge universal primary education by 2015.</p> <p>But the world community and national politicians are unable to agree an action plan or offer more money - no heads of state of any rich northern country are coming to Dakar and the message for the poorest must be that education for the poorest one billion people is not a priority.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an increasingly vocal band of development groups, teachers' unions and grassroots organisations from rich and poor countries is throwing up its hands in horror at what they see as the continuing complacency and impotence of the political and financial elites. Just \u00a35bn - less than a third of what the US spends on cosmetics a year, or the equivalent of just four days of global defence spending, they argue - would provide free education for all.</p> <p>Under the banner of the Global Campaign for Education, more than 300 groups from around the world have arrived in Dakar hoping to be shown a global action plan that mobilises the world to give education to all.</p> <p>If the politicians and bureaucrats ever doubted the value or simple humanity of giving a child a primary education, they could head to Diomaye Sene Street, a semi-slum in downtown Dakar. There, at number nine, they would meet two 10-year-old girls, best friends Ndieumbe Ngom and Coumba Mdoye.</p> <p>Ndieumbe has never been inside a school and lives with her parents and four brothers and sisters in a single, rotting wooden shack. Her mother has no work and her father earns less than \u00a31.50 a day selling western cosmetics in the street. Every penny earned goes on food and rent.</p> <p>Ndieumbe is bright and desperately wants to go to school but however much her parents know that education is the only hope she will have to escape life in the slums, there is nothing they can do. In the past 10 years, largely due to International Monetary Fund constraints on spending, the massively indebted Senegalese government has been forced to charge parents for books, pencils, teachers' salaries and paper.</p> <p>The \u00a325 it would cost to send Ndieumbe to school for a year may as well be \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>Coumba lives next door in the same courtyard. Her parents have work and live in markedly better conditions. Every morning the two children walk round the corner arm in arm to the local primary school. Coumba goes through the door, Ndieumbe returns home to cook and clean. At the end of the day, the two children meet again to play.</p> <p>\"I feel very sad when Coumba goes to school,\" says Ndieumbe. \"I want to learn, I want to be a teacher. If I am to help my family I must have a job. I do not want to sell cosmetics.\"</p> <p>Coumba picks up a slate and in three seconds has added 25 + 19, and then 38 + 27. Ndieumbe recognises only the 2 and the plus signs. But with Coumba's help, Ndieumbe has learned to count to 100 and speak a bit of French, Senegal's second language. She knows too, how to add, but cannot yet write the figures. She cannot write her name but her father, uneducated himself, is teaching her the Arabic alphabet.</p> <p>Coumba loves school. \"I learn many things,\" she says. \"Going to school is like waking up. Today I learned maths and conjugations. I feel very sorry for Ndieumbe and other children I know who do not go to school. I'd like to help them learn, to teach them to write letters. I want them to learn so they can help their parents.\"</p> <p>The difference between the two friends is already marked. Coumba is more confident, open and proud of what she can do, Ndieumbe is shy and retiring. Coumba wants to go to university like her eldest sister, Ndieumbe doesn't know what a university is. Coumba has a sense of a life beyond poverty. Ndieumbe's life is defined by the home where she must work eight hours a day. \"But I want knowledge,\" she says.</p> <p>\"The gap between children with and without education increases as they get older,\" says Ibrahima Faye, who teaches at a primary school 124 miles from Dakar. \"Education gives confidence and independence, it allows people to participate in society,\" he says.</p> <p>So great is the demand for education in his village, he says, that 750 children attend his school and classes must be doubled up. Even so, about 10% of all children in the village cannot afford to go. These children, he says \"will be divided from society, from other families and in their own communities\".</p> <p>Ibrahima is paying for his own children's education as well as that of a 10-year-old boy from a family of subsistence farmers. \"Life is getting more and more expensive,\" he says. \"The modernisation of society means that families need more money, and therefore work.</p> <p>\"Education is the only way that they can get it. When some people get education and others don't, the poor just become poorer and poorer. It means the rich profit from the situation and the gaps in society are emphasised. People must make huge sacrifices to send children to school.\"</p> <p>The same story is repeated across Africa and the world. In the copper belt of Zambia, mothers are paying 70% or more of their family's incomes to hire teachers and set up their own schools.</p> <p>In Brazil, the landless have been forced to bypass the non-existent state education whose budget mostly goes to the middle classes and elite. From South Africa to the Philippines, Bangladesh and Peru, parents are turning to self-help schemes and making the most extraordinary sacrifices to educate their children.</p> <p>Back on the former slave island of Goree, Thioro Fall teaches science at Senegal's most elite school, the Bao academy for girls, which draws on the most brilliant youngsters from Senegal.</p> <p>The school has 30 teachers for 180 students, computers, theatres and a library. The teachers help pay for the poor students. All will go to university and many, says Mr Fall, will get scholarships to study abroad.</p> <p>He says: \"It goes without saying that a lack of education today is the new slavery. Anyone without education today, in the new millennium, is like a slave.</p> <p>\"In fact it's worse than slavery. It's unforgivable.\"</p> <p><b>Empty assurances</b></p> <p>At the 1990 World Education Forum, pledges were made that in the 10 years since have never been met:</p> <p><b> The promises</b></p> <p>\u0095 All children to enjoy a good quality basic education by 2000. Adult illiteracy to be halved \u0095 More aid for education</p> <p>\u0095 Guarantees that debt repayments would not undermine education budgets</p> <p>\u0095 IMF programmes reformed to prevent cuts in education budgets</p> <p>\u0095 Third world governments pledged to attach more weight to basic education when prioritising their budgets</p> <p>\u0095 Public education accessible to all</p> <p><b> The reality</b></p> <p>\u0095 125m children out of school. More illiterate adults than in 1990</p> <p>\u0095 Aid budgets for education cut from $6.8bn (\u00a34.1bn) in 1990 to $5bn in 1998. The US has halved its aid budget for basic education</p> <p>\u0095 On average, sub-Saharan Africa - with more than 40m children not in school - spent $12bn a year on debt repayments in the 1990s, three times spending on basic education. So far, only five highly indebted countries have received debt relief, and most continue to spend more on debt than education</p> <p>\u0095 A recent review of 16 IMF programmes in sub-Saharan Africa found 12 had cut education budgets. Per capita spending on basic education in Zambia, an IMF pupil for the past eight years, is 30% lower than in the mid-1980s</p> <p>\u0095 India, with more children out of school than any other country, spends twice as much on arms as on basic education. Pakistan, with a huge gender gap in education, spends six times as much. Many poor countries in Africa, including Mali, Burkina Faso and Senegal, spend less than half their education budgets on basic education for the poor, subsidising higher education for the wealthy</p> <p>\u0095 Supported by the World Bank, many governments have introduced \"cost recovery\", or charges, for primary school</p>",

Goree is now a moving shrine to the African diaspora and over the next few days most of the 500 world leaders from 181 countries gathering three miles away in Dakar will visit the island to condemn slavery - even as they effectively chain hundreds of millions of the poorest children to lifetimes of ignorance and permanent disadvantage. The United Nations' World Education Forum - the equivalent of the earth summit for education - opens today at the five star Meridien hotel in Dakar. Set behind huge walls far from the city's slums and pollution, the Meridien this week whiffs of complacency, abject failure and broken promises. The same UN bodies, the same governments and the same global financial institutions that 10 years ago in Thailand pledged to provide primary schooling for all by the year 2000, are in Dakar having failed to keep their promises. Today, 125m children have never seen the inside of a school. Another 150m have been forced to drop out of education in the past decade before they could even read or write. Meanwhile, 880m adults are illiterate and few governments or world bodies will admit there is even a crisis. There have been advances, especially in Asia, but the situation now is being likened by charities and grassroots groups to 19th century slavery, with governments deliberately seeking to deprive the poorest of education. Across the world, schools are roofless, teachers have no materials and the poorest parents are being expected to pay for the most basic schooling. During the next three days, the leaders of all the main UN agencies - including the secretary general, Kofi Annan - the 181 government delegations, the head of the World Bank and other global financial institutions, together with Nelson Mandela, Nobel prize winners and other statesman, will hum and haw, hold workshops and plenary sessions and are expected to reaffirm education as a human right and pledge universal primary education by 2015. But the world community and national politicians are unable to agree an action plan or offer more money - no heads of state of any rich northern country are coming to Dakar and the message for the poorest must be that education for the poorest one billion people is not a priority. Meanwhile, an increasingly vocal band of development groups, teachers' unions and grassroots organisations from rich and poor countries is throwing up its hands in horror at what they see as the continuing complacency and impotence of the political and financial elites. Just \u00a35bn - less than a third of what the US spends on cosmetics a year, or the equivalent of just four days of global defence spending, they argue - would provide free education for all. Under the banner of the Global Campaign for Education, more than 300 groups from around the world have arrived in Dakar hoping to be shown a global action plan that mobilises the world to give education to all. If the politicians and bureaucrats ever doubted the value or simple humanity of giving a child a primary education, they could head to Diomaye Sene Street, a semi-slum in downtown Dakar. There, at number nine, they would meet two 10-year-old girls, best friends Ndieumbe Ngom and Coumba Mdoye. Ndieumbe has never been inside a school and lives with her parents and four brothers and sisters in a single, rotting wooden shack. Her mother has no work and her father earns less than \u00a31.50 a day selling western cosmetics in the street. Every penny earned goes on food and rent. Ndieumbe is bright and desperately wants to go to school but however much her parents know that education is the only hope she will have to escape life in the slums, there is nothing they can do. In the past 10 years, largely due to International Monetary Fund constraints on spending, the massively indebted Senegalese government has been forced to charge parents for books, pencils, teachers' salaries and paper. The \u00a325 it would cost to send Ndieumbe to school for a year may as well be \u00a3250,000. Coumba lives next door in the same courtyard. Her parents have work and live in markedly better conditions. Every morning the two children walk round the corner arm in arm to the local primary school. Coumba goes through the door, Ndieumbe returns home to cook and clean. At the end of the day, the two children meet again to play. \"I feel very sad when Coumba goes to school,\" says Ndieumbe. \"I want to learn, I want to be a teacher. If I am to help my family I must have a job. I do not want to sell cosmetics.\" Coumba picks up a slate and in three seconds has added 25 + 19, and then 38 + 27. Ndieumbe recognises only the 2 and the plus signs. But with Coumba's help, Ndieumbe has learned to count to 100 and speak a bit of French, Senegal's second language. She knows too, how to add, but cannot yet write the figures. She cannot write her name but her father, uneducated himself, is teaching her the Arabic alphabet. Coumba loves school. \"I learn many things,\" she says. \"Going to school is like waking up. Today I learned maths and conjugations. I feel very sorry for Ndieumbe and other children I know who do not go to school. I'd like to help them learn, to teach them to write letters. I want them to learn so they can help their parents.\" The difference between the two friends is already marked. Coumba is more confident, open and proud of what she can do, Ndieumbe is shy and retiring. Coumba wants to go to university like her eldest sister, Ndieumbe doesn't know what a university is. Coumba has a sense of a life beyond poverty. Ndieumbe's life is defined by the home where she must work eight hours a day. \"But I want knowledge,\" she says. \"The gap between children with and without education increases as they get older,\" says Ibrahima Faye, who teaches at a primary school 124 miles from Dakar. \"Education gives confidence and independence, it allows people to participate in society,\" he says. So great is the demand for education in his village, he says, that 750 children attend his school and classes must be doubled up. Even so, about 10% of all children in the village cannot afford to go. These children, he says \"will be divided from society, from other families and in their own communities\". Ibrahima is paying for his own children's education as well as that of a 10-year-old boy from a family of subsistence farmers. \"Life is getting more and more expensive,\" he says. \"The modernisation of society means that families need more money, and therefore work. \"Education is the only way that they can get it. When some people get education and others don't, the poor just become poorer and poorer. It means the rich profit from the situation and the gaps in society are emphasised. People must make huge sacrifices to send children to school.\" The same story is repeated across Africa and the world. In the copper belt of Zambia, mothers are paying 70% or more of their family's incomes to hire teachers and set up their own schools. In Brazil, the landless have been forced to bypass the non-existent state education whose budget mostly goes to the middle classes and elite. From South Africa to the Philippines, Bangladesh and Peru, parents are turning to self-help schemes and making the most extraordinary sacrifices to educate their children. Back on the former slave island of Goree, Thioro Fall teaches science at Senegal's most elite school, the Bao academy for girls, which draws on the most brilliant youngsters from Senegal. The school has 30 teachers for 180 students, computers, theatres and a library. The teachers help pay for the poor students. All will go to university and many, says Mr Fall, will get scholarships to study abroad. He says: \"It goes without saying that a lack of education today is the new slavery. Anyone without education today, in the new millennium, is like a slave. \"In fact it's worse than slavery. It's unforgivable.\" Empty assurances At the 1990 World Education Forum, pledges were made that in the 10 years since have never been met: The promises \u0095 All children to enjoy a good quality basic education by 2000. Adult illiteracy to be halved \u0095 More aid for education \u0095 Guarantees that debt repayments would not undermine education budgets \u0095 IMF programmes reformed to prevent cuts in education budgets \u0095 Third world governments pledged to attach more weight to basic education when prioritising their budgets \u0095 Public education accessible to all The reality \u0095 125m children out of school. More illiterate adults than in 1990 \u0095 Aid budgets for education cut from $6.8bn (\u00a34.1bn) in 1990 to $5bn in 1998. The US has halved its aid budget for basic education \u0095 On average, sub-Saharan Africa - with more than 40m children not in school - spent $12bn a year on debt repayments in the 1990s, three times spending on basic education. So far, only five highly indebted countries have received debt relief, and most continue to spend more on debt than education \u0095 A recent review of 16 IMF programmes in sub-Saharan Africa found 12 had cut education budgets. Per capita spending on basic education in Zambia, an IMF pupil for the past eight years, is 30% lower than in the mid-1980s \u0095 India, with more children out of school than any other country, spends twice as much on arms as on basic education. Pakistan, with a huge gender gap in education, spends six times as much. Many poor countries in Africa, including Mali, Burkina Faso and Senegal, spend less than half their education budgets on basic education for the poor, subsidising higher education for the wealthy \u0095 Supported by the World Bank, many governments have introduced \"cost recovery\", or charges, for primary school",

But politicians aren't doing their job if they don't listen and respond to the unprecedented public outcry which has greeted the murder conviction for this Norfolk farmer who was defending his home against burglars.</p> <p>\"I understand the outcry and I share it. It is time we asked ourselves some blunt questions:</p> <p>\"What is the point of having a police service and prisons when three criminals, with 114 convictions between them, are allowed to wander about free to terrorise rural communities?</p> <p>\"What has happened to our courts system when career burglars and muggers get a few dozen hours community service, or a couple of months in prison if they're unlucky, while people defending their homes against the very same criminals risk long prison sentences?</p> <p>\"Why is the Government cutting police numbers, and why has it hamstrung the job of those policemen and policewomen who remain, at the very moment when crime is starting to rise again?</p> <p>\"Politicians need to provide answers to these questions if public confidence in the criminal justice system is not to collapse altogether. If the Labour Government cannot or will not, then it is the duty of the Conservative Opposition to do so.</p> <p>\"These are the broad principles of our response to the anger expressed by the British people in recent days and months. I will expand on them further when I speak to the Police Federation Conference next month.</p> <p>\"First, we are going to restore confidence in our courts and prison service.</p> <p>\"The three men who broke into Tony Martin's farm had each been convicted of dozens of criminal offences, ranging from burglary and theft to wounding and assault of a police officer. Most of the time they were fined paltry sums or given community service. Occasionally they got short prison sentences, and even then were released early after just a few months behind bars.</p> <p>\"Their histories of repeated crime and repeatedly lenient sentences is sadly familiar in today's courts. No wonder the public despair and the police ask what the point is of catching criminals when they just get released back on to the street. Part of the blame lies with a liberal legal establishment that too often appears to put concerns for the rights of criminals before the rights of the millions of vulnerable people who live in fear of crime.</p> <p>\"The next Conservative Government will take a different approach.</p> <p>\"We will introduce honesty in sentencing, which means that criminals serve the sentences handed down in court. Automatic early release on licence will be ended. We will extend the 'two strikes and you're out regime' to other crimes, such as selling drugs to children. We will greatly expand the number of Secure Training Centres so that young thugs are actually taken off our streets and locked up. And we will make prisoners work in prison, rather than sit about learning from each other about how to commit more crimes.</p> <p>\"These common sense policies are tough. Criminals won't like them; nor will some left-wing pressure groups. That is because they restore the proper balance between justice and a safe society, and because they are true to the instincts of a British people fed up with the failure of the courts and prisons to deal with persistent criminals.</p> <p>\"Second, we are going to give the police the support and backing they deserve.</p> <p>One of the greatest deceits of this Government has been to promise to be tough on crime while at the same time cutting the number of police who fight crime.</p> <p>\"By the end of this Parliament, there will be 2,500 fewer police than there were at the beginning. What sort of message does that send to career criminals about our determination to catch them? What does it say to rural communities miles from the nearest police station, or families terrorised on sink estates, or elderly people and young women afraid to walk down our streets at night?</p> <p>\"This Government's cut in police numbers is a total disgrace. Tony Blair and Jack Straw are failing in their most basic duty, that of protecting the public.</p> <p>\"The next Conservative Government will reverse Labour's cut in the number of police. We will also give the police the support and backing they need. At the moment many policemen and policewomen spend just 20 per cent of their time actually fighting crime. We will make sure the police spend less time filling in forms and hanging around in court waiting rooms, and more time on the streets catching criminals.</p> <p>\"Third, we are going to re-balance the justice system to protect people who defend their families, their homes and their property against criminals.</p> <p>\"Vigilantes have no place in a civilised society. But there is all the difference in the world between the career criminal who sets out deliberately to burgle a house and the terrified home-owner who acts to protect himself and his home. Unless our laws reflect natural justice, then they fall into disrepute.</p> <p>\"The next Conservative Government will overhaul the law with a strong presumption that, in future, the state will be on the side of people who protect their homes and their families against criminals.</p> <p>\"Restoring confidence in our courts, supporting our police and tipping the balance of justice in favour of those who defend their homes and their families: these are three key principles which will guide any Government I lead.</p> <p>\"Conservatives believe in the first and foremost responsibility of the state is to protect its law-abiding citizens. This Government is failing in that responsibility, which is why the outcry over the Martin case has reverberated far beyond a small village in Norfolk.</p> <p>The Conservative Party has heard the outcry and is responding.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"The Tony Martin case lit a touch-paper that has led to an explosion of anger and resentment among millions of law-abiding British people who no longer feel the state is on their side. \"The specifics of the particular case are best left to the criminal courts. But politicians aren't doing their job if they don't listen and respond to the unprecedented public outcry which has greeted the murder conviction for this Norfolk farmer who was defending his home against burglars. \"I understand the outcry and I share it. It is time we asked ourselves some blunt questions: \"What is the point of having a police service and prisons when three criminals, with 114 convictions between them, are allowed to wander about free to terrorise rural communities? \"What has happened to our courts system when career burglars and muggers get a few dozen hours community service, or a couple of months in prison if they're unlucky, while people defending their homes against the very same criminals risk long prison sentences? \"Why is the Government cutting police numbers, and why has it hamstrung the job of those policemen and policewomen who remain, at the very moment when crime is starting to rise again? \"Politicians need to provide answers to these questions if public confidence in the criminal justice system is not to collapse altogether. If the Labour Government cannot or will not, then it is the duty of the Conservative Opposition to do so. \"These are the broad principles of our response to the anger expressed by the British people in recent days and months. I will expand on them further when I speak to the Police Federation Conference next month. \"First, we are going to restore confidence in our courts and prison service. \"The three men who broke into Tony Martin's farm had each been convicted of dozens of criminal offences, ranging from burglary and theft to wounding and assault of a police officer. Most of the time they were fined paltry sums or given community service. Occasionally they got short prison sentences, and even then were released early after just a few months behind bars. \"Their histories of repeated crime and repeatedly lenient sentences is sadly familiar in today's courts. No wonder the public despair and the police ask what the point is of catching criminals when they just get released back on to the street. Part of the blame lies with a liberal legal establishment that too often appears to put concerns for the rights of criminals before the rights of the millions of vulnerable people who live in fear of crime. \"The next Conservative Government will take a different approach. \"We will introduce honesty in sentencing, which means that criminals serve the sentences handed down in court. Automatic early release on licence will be ended. We will extend the 'two strikes and you're out regime' to other crimes, such as selling drugs to children. We will greatly expand the number of Secure Training Centres so that young thugs are actually taken off our streets and locked up. And we will make prisoners work in prison, rather than sit about learning from each other about how to commit more crimes. \"These common sense policies are tough. Criminals won't like them; nor will some left-wing pressure groups. That is because they restore the proper balance between justice and a safe society, and because they are true to the instincts of a British people fed up with the failure of the courts and prisons to deal with persistent criminals. \"Second, we are going to give the police the support and backing they deserve. One of the greatest deceits of this Government has been to promise to be tough on crime while at the same time cutting the number of police who fight crime. \"By the end of this Parliament, there will be 2,500 fewer police than there were at the beginning. What sort of message does that send to career criminals about our determination to catch them? What does it say to rural communities miles from the nearest police station, or families terrorised on sink estates, or elderly people and young women afraid to walk down our streets at night? \"This Government's cut in police numbers is a total disgrace. Tony Blair and Jack Straw are failing in their most basic duty, that of protecting the public. \"The next Conservative Government will reverse Labour's cut in the number of police. We will also give the police the support and backing they need. At the moment many policemen and policewomen spend just 20 per cent of their time actually fighting crime. We will make sure the police spend less time filling in forms and hanging around in court waiting rooms, and more time on the streets catching criminals. \"Third, we are going to re-balance the justice system to protect people who defend their families, their homes and their property against criminals. \"Vigilantes have no place in a civilised society. But there is all the difference in the world between the career criminal who sets out deliberately to burgle a house and the terrified home-owner who acts to protect himself and his home. Unless our laws reflect natural justice, then they fall into disrepute. \"The next Conservative Government will overhaul the law with a strong presumption that, in future, the state will be on the side of people who protect their homes and their families against criminals. \"Restoring confidence in our courts, supporting our police and tipping the balance of justice in favour of those who defend their homes and their families: these are three key principles which will guide any Government I lead. \"Conservatives believe in the first and foremost responsibility of the state is to protect its law-abiding citizens. This Government is failing in that responsibility, which is why the outcry over the Martin case has reverberated far beyond a small village in Norfolk. The Conservative Party has heard the outcry and is responding.\"",

Nada. Zip. </p> <p>The report, Video Games and Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings and Behaviour in the Laboratory and in Life, by Craig A Anderson and Karen E Dill, appears in the April issue of the American Psychological Association's Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. It consists of two separate experiments performed on psychology undergraduates at Iowa State University. The first experiment is merely a set of interviews with the students and decides that \"aggressive delinquent behaviour\" (fighting, mugging) is positively correlated with \"exposure to videogame violence\", and also that low academic performance is correlated with a longer amount of time spent playing video games in general. </p> <p>We can deal with the second point straight away. Of course if you spend six hours a day playing video games your school grades will suffer. They'll also suffer if you spend six hours a day baking cookies, hugging trees or doing anything else except your homework. Next! </p> <p>The other finding crumbles when confronted with the crucial scientific slogan: Correlation Ain't Causation. There is no evidence that the games cause real-life violence. To their credit, the authors of the article acknowledge this: \"It could be that the obtained video game links to aggressive and non-aggressive delinquency are wholly due to the fact that highly aggressive individuals are especially attracted to violent video games.\" In other words, violent kids are more likely to play violent games. Well, duh, of course they are. And they're more likely to steal your lunchbox. But lunchboxes don't cause crime. </p> <p>The second experiment is more interesting. One group of students played the violent Wolfenstein 3-D (in which you shoot Nazis) for 15 minutes, the other played the tedious Myst (in which you look at pretty pictures and solve dull puzzles). (By the way, Anderson claims that Myst \"shares the 3-D 'walk through' format\" of Wolfenstein. It doesn't.) Then the students were told to play a game of quick reactions against a human in another cubicle. After a round, they could \"punish\" their opponent (who was actually just a computer) with a blast of noise. The people who had just been playing Wolfenstein punished their enemies with longer blasts of noise than the Myst players. Conclusion: a violent game makes you more aggressive. </p> <p>But the noise increase was tiny. The Wolfensteiners averaged a 6.81-second blast; the Mysters a 6.65-second blast. And this difference appeared only when the participants had just lost a round of the reflex game. You'd see the same thing after making someone play a game of squash or chess and comparing them with a couch-potato's responses. And we have only the author's own pet theory, their \"General Affective Aggression Model\", as evidence that such a minuscule short-term effect might translate into long-term violence. </p> <p>In fact, the article unwittingly furnishes evidence for the opposite argument, the \"catharsis hypothesis\". Several other studies in the last decade have argued that playing violent games is actually a healthy release for natural feelings of aggression: a safe way to exercise them without harming real people. This is the view shared by nearly all gameplayers and industry types, not to mention the New York Police Department, who told the producer of the notorious joyriding-and-cop-shooting game Grand Theft Auto: \"We'd rather they did it in your game than on the street.\" </p> <p>The crux comes when the psychologists notice that women were more hostile than men after playing both games, delivering longer blasts of noise. In fact, when the participant had just won a round of the reflex game, this gender difference was the only one observed: it had nothing to do with whether they'd been playing Wolfenstein or Myst. The authors are bemused, and suspect it's because the women in their study were generally \"less familiar with videogames\". </p> <p>But this implies either that the catharsis hypothesis is true, or that what the experiment was measuring wasn't aggression at all. Either the men delivered shorter noise blasts because they regularly used games as a vent for their natural aggression and so were more chilled-out, or the experiment was measuring frustration (because the women weren't as good at either game) rather than violent tendencies. </p> <p> In conclusion, the authors again have to admit to having \"no empirical evidence\" that games increase violent behaviour. They even sulkily acknowledge the many competing views: one 1997 study argues that video games increase children's IQ, others claim further evidence for the catharsis hypothesis or point out that the communal activities of video game hint-swapping among children aid socialisation. </p> <p>Playing games isn't going to make you want to practise violence in real life. The skills aren't the same anyway. If I want to beat someone up, I can hardly use my Doom skills on them, because whacking them over the head with a mouse isn't going to hurt much. I'd be better off studying karate. And people who can't tell the difference between video game fiction and real life, like Harris and Klebold, are psychopaths, and they might equally be set off by a film, or a heavy-metal record played backwards. There's no accounting for nutters. </p> <p>Video game enthusiasts should thank Anderson and Dill. They tried to prove that videogames are bad for you; but they ended up showing that they might make you a more relaxed human being. Thank goodness for that. Now, I'm feeling tense, frustrated and aggressive after all this irresponsible and inaccurate reporting, so if you'll excuse me, I'm off to fight someone to death with an enormous axe. </p> <p>\u0095 Steven Poole's Trigger Happy: The Inner Life of Videogames (Fourth Estate, \u00a312) is out on May 18.</p>",

In fact, when the participant had just won a round of the reflex game, this gender difference was the only one observed: it had nothing to do with whether they'd been playing Wolfenstein or Myst. The authors are bemused, and suspect it's because the women in their study were generally \"less familiar with videogames\". But this implies either that the catharsis hypothesis is true, or that what the experiment was measuring wasn't aggression at all. Either the men delivered shorter noise blasts because they regularly used games as a vent for their natural aggression and so were more chilled-out, or the experiment was measuring frustration (because the women weren't as good at either game) rather than violent tendencies. In conclusion, the authors again have to admit to having \"no empirical evidence\" that games increase violent behaviour. They even sulkily acknowledge the many competing views: one 1997 study argues that video games increase children's IQ, others claim further evidence for the catharsis hypothesis or point out that the communal activities of video game hint-swapping among children aid socialisation. Playing games isn't going to make you want to practise violence in real life. The skills aren't the same anyway. If I want to beat someone up, I can hardly use my Doom skills on them, because whacking them over the head with a mouse isn't going to hurt much. I'd be better off studying karate. And people who can't tell the difference between video game fiction and real life, like Harris and Klebold, are psychopaths, and they might equally be set off by a film, or a heavy-metal record played backwards. There's no accounting for nutters. Video game enthusiasts should thank Anderson and Dill. They tried to prove that videogames are bad for you; but they ended up showing that they might make you a more relaxed human being. Thank goodness for that. Now, I'm feeling tense, frustrated and aggressive after all this irresponsible and inaccurate reporting, so if you'll excuse me, I'm off to fight someone to death with an enormous axe. \u0095 Steven Poole's Trigger Happy: The Inner Life of Videogames (Fourth Estate, \u00a312) is out on May 18.",

      "body": "<p>German researchers announced this week that pet hamsters are anti-social, uninquisitive animals so frightened of humans they almost have a seizure when one comes near. After being stroked, hamsters are so stressed they need 20 minutes to calm down. Hammy does not like to live in a cage. Hammy would prefer to live down a hole, alone. </p> <p>Welcome to the latest pet paradox. Around 18m British households own pets. We keep 7.3m cats, 7m dogs, 1m rabbits and hundreds of thousands of small mammals and fish. The pet industry is worth \u00a33bn a year and manuals claim pets teach children about sex, death and responsibility. So how do you now explain to your child that by giving Hammy some nice fresh bedding they are forcing him out of its environment, increasing his heart rate by 150 beats a minute and pushing him close to a coronary? </p> <p>\"Parents should start from the assumption that children don't need pets and pets don't need children,\" says child psychologist Jack Boyle. \"There is no research to show that if you don't provide a pet you are depriving your child. In some cases, where a child is unhappy or lonely, pets can be an excellent help, but it is not a significant factor for child development in general. Plan your pet choice extremely carefully.\" </p> <p>It is increasingly hard to find an animal up to the job in a world where our innocent caresses are actually slowly driving our pets mad. </p> <p>\"Goldfish have hearing so acute that a slight greeting tap on their bowl is like taking them to a rave where the bass is up full volume and then standing them next to a pneumatic drill,\" says Lynn Gibbons, education officer at the London Aquarium. </p> <p>Likewise, chinchillas don't like sugary food and will become diabetic if given a dog treat. They also mate for life, and if separated from their spouse they will die of a broken heart. Pet spiders dread being picked up and when caressed will shed all the hair on their back. \"Most pet spiders are completely bald on their backs,\" says Linda Walker, chief keeper at London Zoo's Children's Zoo. </p> <p>The natural habits of common pets are often very different from what we imagine, says Walker. Guinea pigs, for example, are terribly shy and prone to die of shock if touched. \"If a child picks a guinea pig up and accidentally drops it, even from a small height, it could die,\" says Walker, who runs a special pet centre to teach people how to keep pets in their natural environment. </p> <p>Walker's guinea pig enclosure is two and a half metres squared, filled with straw and hay, and logs for exercise. Four guinea pigs sit in separate corners, each facing the wall and sucking on long pieces of straw. They are the rodent equivalent of someone too embarrassed to order spaghetti in an Italian restaurant. They are too worried about manners even to let their pen-mates see them eating. To place a guinea pig on a lawn, uncamouflaged, and give it a piece of apple is utterly nerve-wracking. </p> <p>Nor should you take them for walkies, as pet shops often advise. \"To put a guinea pig on a lead is ridiculous,\" says Walker, and highly embarrassing for it if another is present. Don't take heart if the guinea pig begins rushing backwards and forwards, it's probably having a panic attack. \"Guinea pigs do like company and will feel depressed if alone,\" says Walker. \"You should pair them with another guinea pig of the same sex, or a rabbit.\" </p> <p>But rabbits are another minefield. \"They do not like being handled by children,\" says Julie Briggs of the RSPCA. \"So they are the most common backyard sufferers\". In 1998, 22,874 rabbits were handed back to the RSPCA from owners who couldn't handle them, in third place after cats and dogs. \"Female rabbits are prone to terrible pre-menstrual tension and will become incredibly bolshy and bite children,\" says Walker. \"You should opt for males and buy two as they are incredibly sociable and like living in groups. But don't put them on a lead because it's unnatural.\" </p> <p>What about the trend for keeping rabbits in the house and litter-training them? This is fine in principle, but rabbits need fresh air and you are doing them no favours by keeping them in a shed, says Briggs. \"If they are kept too warm, they have breathing difficulties.\" </p> <p>The most silent sufferers are goldfish. Apart from their acute hearing, the five-second memory theory is a myth. \"Keeping them in a bowl or a circular tank is just cruel,\" says Walker. \"They should not swim round in circles but in a straight line at a constant speed. If they are in an empty bowl, they will be unstimulated and depressed.\" </p> <p>Fish recognise their owners and feeders, says Lynn Gibbons of the London Aquarium. If they are always fed by someone in a yellow shirt, they will come to the surface if a yellow shirt comes near. But if they come to the surface and gulp at you, it's probably because they are suffocating. \"All goldfish need aerated tanks with a filter,\" says Gibbons. \"Buy a long, rectangular tank, with play things and algae for amusement and to hide behind. They are social creatures, so buy in pairs from the same tank. Don't introduce another fish from a different background.\" </p> <p>Other pets endure dreadful situations due to popular pet myths. Mice don't like cheese and shouldn't be fed it as it makes them smell. Parrots crave cheese, but must not be kept in a cage or left alone, as they need company. Female budgies don't sing, but males do. Both get depressed when separated from other birds and should be kept in an aviary, says Walker. Budgies must have a bath in their cage and be let out twice a day to fly around. The sound of a dog barking in the distance can send them mad with fear. </p> <p>The best pets, Walker advises, are gerbils. \"They have longer lifespans and are active in the day whereas hamsters are nocturnal. They also need very little maintenance.\" This is fair enough if you think they live in a cage with a wheel. But they don't. At the London Zoo pet centre they reside in a deep glass tank half filled with soil. \"Gerbils are burrowers and must be placed in a tank with a peat substitute and sand mix packed tightly so it doesn't collapse. Then create tunnels for them using clay pipes and old bricks and children can watch them dig.\" The tank only needs to be changed once every few months, and gerbils should be bought in groups of four of the same sex from the same litter. Don't introduce outside gerbils, even if one dies. </p> <p>The worst pets, the RSPCA and London Zoo agree, are terrapins. \"They grow to the size of a dinner plate and may live 30 years,\" says Briggs. \"They don't like being handled, they tend to bite and they need a two-metre long tank with water changed every day. Many are bred on chicken farms and fed chicken offal and they are notorious for passing salmonella to children.\" </p> <p> Tortoises are also not a good bet. One family dutifully places theirs in a sandwhich box in the fridge every winter for two months so it can hibernate. \"No, no, no!\" cries Briggs. Apart from being a protected endangered species, tortoises, believe it or not, have a habit of speeding off when you are not looking. Briggs says, if you must have one, put a microchip into its shell so it can be identified when it runs away, as it will definitely make a dash for it. \"Microchips are a painless way of tagging animals and can be fitted by the RSPCA and vets.\" </p> <p>Briggs and Walker suggest pets should be bought straight from the mother animal through friends or breeders, not pet shops. Assess your child's temperament before buying. Rodentologist Victoria Carey suggests the best age for a child to have a pet hamster or small rodent is eight and above, and for guinea pigs not before 10. Hamsters need a solid wheel, not one with rungs as this hurts their feet and if they roll on their backs and play dead, it is a sign they are utterly miserable. Cats should be fed twice a day and should not live in flats. Dogs should be walked twice a day and older dogs may not like to be introduced to children. </p> <p>\"Don't fall for fashion,\" adds Briggs. \"Growing numbers of families are buying what they are told are miniature crocodiles. These are growing to six to 12 feet and are being kept in bathrooms. Recently we found a cobra floating down the Thames in a cardboard box because the owner didn't know what to do with it.\" </p> <p> \u0095 For advice on choosing pets: RSPCA: 01403 264181 British association of rodentologists: 01480 455 346 British Rabbit Council: 01636 676042</p>",

Brian Pattern is putting it back with a great new collection that looks set to become as much of a classic as his earlier Gargling With Jelly. </p> <p>There is a whole world here, from the good advice of the title poem to the giggly silliness of The Day I Got My Finger Stuck Up My Nose. \"When I got my finger stuck up my nose/I went to the doctor, who said,/'Nothing like this had happened before./ We will have to chop off your head.' \" </p> <p>Pattern can be both funny and perceptive in poems such as The Burden of Bringing Up a Single Parent, and he isn't afraid of the profound. In eight lines, The Inside of Things makes you feel as if you've grasped the secret of the universe. </p> <p>Start your children with these poems at five and they'll be going back for more at nine. As Pattern himself observes in the poem Reading the Classics: \"Though time's a thief it cannot thieve/One page from the world of make believe.\" Quite. </p> <p> <strong> How to buy the books</strong> </p> <p> All the books can be bought direct from Books Unlimited. The titles below can also be bought through Guardian CultureShop, at the discount indicated: freephone 0800 3166 102, or send a cheque payable to the Guardian CultureShop to 250 Western Ave, London W3 6EE. </p> <p><strong> Ages 0-4</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> My Dad</strong></p> <p> Anthony Browne (Doubleday, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99 plus UK p&amp;p 99p, details above) </p> <p> If you aren't familiar with Browne's sideways looks at the world, here's a chance to introduce the very youngest members of the family to this children's illustrator who really does deserve the tag genius. </p> <p>Browne has a sharp eye that sees the extraordinary in the most ordinary lives. Here, a dad, who never gets out of his dressing gown, sees off a wolf, dances the tango, replaces one of the three tenors and does long division, all before breakfast. </p> <p>There is a great sense of humour at work here in these typically bold drawings that are full of the kind of visual jokes that keep small children alert and stop parents dropping off during repeated readings. </p> <p> <strong> Whose House?</strong> </p> <p> Colin and Jacqui Hawkins (Collins, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99 freepost) </p> <p> If you go down to the woods today you're in for a rather nice surprise from this really clever and imaginative lift-the-flap book. </p> <p>Look at the pictures and read the clues and you'll be able to work out which nursery character lives in which of the intricately drawn fairy-tale dwellings. Does the thatched cottage in the woods belong to Red Riding Hood, her granny, or maybe the three bears? Once inside the house a whole new world of domestic interiors opens up, and children have to search for objects in each room. </p> <p>This undoubtedly has educational value, but it works because it is great fun. It is also value for money because you'll all get hours of pleasure from it as the sheer detail of each of the drawings means this is a book you can return to again and again. </p> <p><strong> Ages 5-7 </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Coral Goes Swimming</strong> </p> <p>Simon Puttock and Stephen Lambert (Hodder, \u00a34.99, CultureShop price \u00a34.99 freepost) </p> <p> You can glimpse the whole world in the reflection of a paddling pool in this striking picture book with text, which is about the limitless, unfettered nature of a child's imagination. Sent to play in her paddling pool, Coral embarks on a watery journey that sees her float past the neighbour's houses and out to sea, where she rides whales around the Cape of Good Hope, swims with seahorses in the Indian Ocean, chases penguins in Antarctica, watches flying fish in Fiji and floats with the manatee off Florida. </p> <p>In best picture book style, Coral is back in time for tea. Baked Alaska, no less. A book that, with its lovely pastel drawings and genuine sense of curiosity, cracks open the world. </p> <p> <strong> You're All Animals</strong> </p> <p>Nicholas Allan (Hutchinson, \u00a37.99, CultureShop price \u00a35.99 plus UK p&amp;p 99p) </p> <p> When young Billy Trunk, an elephant, starts school, everyone is perfectly friendly. But Billy won't make friends because he thinks that they are all really weird. Well, they are slimy frogs, creepy spiders and toothy crocodiles. Billy believes that he will never have anything in common with any of these creatures and longs for \"a friend who's just like me\". Of course, with a little help from the computer, he does hitch up with his soulmate - who turns out to be the mouse in the next desk. This is a book about tolerance, not judging by appearances and seeing what's under your nose. Allan's first-person narrative and loopy line drawings ensure it is a story told with enough wit and charm to repay repeated readings. </p> <p><strong> Ages 8-11</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> I Was a Rat</strong> </p> <p>Philip Pullman (Corgi Yearling, \u00a33.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99 freepost) </p> <p> A toothsome little number this, which mixes age-old fairy tale with bang up to date morality tale. When old Bob the cobbler and his wife, Joan, open the door one dark night, they discover a boy in a page's uniform who claims that he was once a rat. The childless couple take him in and name him Roger. But soon rumours begin to spread about the strange boy and the unscrupulous seek to make a fast buck from him. </p> <p>Set against the background of a fairy-tale royal wedding, Pullman's story plunders Cinderella, wolf-children myth and tabloid culture to create a satisfying story that points up our tendency to demonise what we do not understand. A novel that you can gnaw on for hours. </p> <p> <strong> Charmed Life</strong> </p> <p>Diana Wynne Jones </p> <p>(Collins, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price, \u00a34.99 freepost) </p> <p> Move over, Harry Potter, and make way for Cat Chant and his sister, Gwendolyn, who everyone says is a young witch with exceptional powers. When the children are orphaned in a paddle-boat disaster, they find themselves whisked away to Chrestomanci Castle, where the great enchanter is soon locked in a battle of wills with Gwendolyn. </p> <p>Wynne Jones's novel won the Guardian Award for Children's Books back in 1977, but then fell into obscurity. This reissue, in an attractive new format, is the first of five books in the Chrestomanci series, although not all feature Cat. This book and the others should plug the gap nicely for anyone who can't wait for the arrival of the next Potter. </p> <p><strong> Ages 12 + </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Plague</strong> </p> <p>Malcolm Rose (Scholastic, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99 freepost) </p> <p> Who could think of any place more safe and dull than Milton Keynes? But as teenagers Rev, Lucy and Scott while away the summer, an invisible enemy is heading their way. Soon the town is in the grip of a deadly virus that causes its victims to haemorrhage to death. The army is called in, part of the town is turned into a ghetto and tensions between different parts of the community reach breaking point as scientists race against time to find a cure. </p> <p>This is not the most literary of novels, but it is a compulsive page turner that would grip even the most reluctant reader, with its jump-cut style reminiscent of popular TV series. It even succeeds in making viral science seem sexy, which is no mean feat. </p> <p> <strong> Young American</strong> </p> <p>Jeff Gomez (Scholastic, \u00a35.99; CultureShop price, \u00a35.99 freepost) </p> <p> A rites-of-passage novel, narrated by 14-year-old Perry, who comes not just from a broken home but one with \"multiple fractures\".

      "bodyText": "Book of the Month Juggling With Gerbils Brian Pattern (Puffin, \u00a33.99) We teach our children nursery rhymes, but the poetry often goes out of their lives by the age of five or so. Brian Pattern is putting it back with a great new collection that looks set to become as much of a classic as his earlier Gargling With Jelly. There is a whole world here, from the good advice of the title poem to the giggly silliness of The Day I Got My Finger Stuck Up My Nose. \"When I got my finger stuck up my nose/I went to the doctor, who said,/'Nothing like this had happened before./ We will have to chop off your head.' \" Pattern can be both funny and perceptive in poems such as The Burden of Bringing Up a Single Parent, and he isn't afraid of the profound. In eight lines, The Inside of Things makes you feel as if you've grasped the secret of the universe. Start your children with these poems at five and they'll be going back for more at nine. As Pattern himself observes in the poem Reading the Classics: \"Though time's a thief it cannot thieve/One page from the world of make believe.\" Quite. How to buy the books All the books can be bought direct from Books Unlimited. The titles below can also be bought through Guardian CultureShop, at the discount indicated: freephone 0800 3166 102, or send a cheque payable to the Guardian CultureShop to 250 Western Ave, London W3 6EE. Ages 0-4 My Dad Anthony Browne (Doubleday, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99 plus UK p&amp;p 99p, details above) If you aren't familiar with Browne's sideways looks at the world, here's a chance to introduce the very youngest members of the family to this children's illustrator who really does deserve the tag genius. Browne has a sharp eye that sees the extraordinary in the most ordinary lives. Here, a dad, who never gets out of his dressing gown, sees off a wolf, dances the tango, replaces one of the three tenors and does long division, all before breakfast. There is a great sense of humour at work here in these typically bold drawings that are full of the kind of visual jokes that keep small children alert and stop parents dropping off during repeated readings. Whose House? Colin and Jacqui Hawkins (Collins, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99 freepost) If you go down to the woods today you're in for a rather nice surprise from this really clever and imaginative lift-the-flap book. Look at the pictures and read the clues and you'll be able to work out which nursery character lives in which of the intricately drawn fairy-tale dwellings. Does the thatched cottage in the woods belong to Red Riding Hood, her granny, or maybe the three bears? Once inside the house a whole new world of domestic interiors opens up, and children have to search for objects in each room. This undoubtedly has educational value, but it works because it is great fun. It is also value for money because you'll all get hours of pleasure from it as the sheer detail of each of the drawings means this is a book you can return to again and again. Ages 5-7 Coral Goes Swimming Simon Puttock and Stephen Lambert (Hodder, \u00a34.99, CultureShop price \u00a34.99 freepost) You can glimpse the whole world in the reflection of a paddling pool in this striking picture book with text, which is about the limitless, unfettered nature of a child's imagination. Sent to play in her paddling pool, Coral embarks on a watery journey that sees her float past the neighbour's houses and out to sea, where she rides whales around the Cape of Good Hope, swims with seahorses in the Indian Ocean, chases penguins in Antarctica, watches flying fish in Fiji and floats with the manatee off Florida. In best picture book style, Coral is back in time for tea. Baked Alaska, no less. A book that, with its lovely pastel drawings and genuine sense of curiosity, cracks open the world. You're All Animals Nicholas Allan (Hutchinson, \u00a37.99, CultureShop price \u00a35.99 plus UK p&amp;p 99p) When young Billy Trunk, an elephant, starts school, everyone is perfectly friendly. But Billy won't make friends because he thinks that they are all really weird. Well, they are slimy frogs, creepy spiders and toothy crocodiles. Billy believes that he will never have anything in common with any of these creatures and longs for \"a friend who's just like me\". Of course, with a little help from the computer, he does hitch up with his soulmate - who turns out to be the mouse in the next desk. This is a book about tolerance, not judging by appearances and seeing what's under your nose. Allan's first-person narrative and loopy line drawings ensure it is a story told with enough wit and charm to repay repeated readings. Ages 8-11 I Was a Rat Philip Pullman (Corgi Yearling, \u00a33.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99 freepost) A toothsome little number this, which mixes age-old fairy tale with bang up to date morality tale. When old Bob the cobbler and his wife, Joan, open the door one dark night, they discover a boy in a page's uniform who claims that he was once a rat. The childless couple take him in and name him Roger. But soon rumours begin to spread about the strange boy and the unscrupulous seek to make a fast buck from him. Set against the background of a fairy-tale royal wedding, Pullman's story plunders Cinderella, wolf-children myth and tabloid culture to create a satisfying story that points up our tendency to demonise what we do not understand. A novel that you can gnaw on for hours. Charmed Life Diana Wynne Jones (Collins, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price, \u00a34.99 freepost) Move over, Harry Potter, and make way for Cat Chant and his sister, Gwendolyn, who everyone says is a young witch with exceptional powers. When the children are orphaned in a paddle-boat disaster, they find themselves whisked away to Chrestomanci Castle, where the great enchanter is soon locked in a battle of wills with Gwendolyn. Wynne Jones's novel won the Guardian Award for Children's Books back in 1977, but then fell into obscurity. This reissue, in an attractive new format, is the first of five books in the Chrestomanci series, although not all feature Cat. This book and the others should plug the gap nicely for anyone who can't wait for the arrival of the next Potter. Ages 12 + Plague Malcolm Rose (Scholastic, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99 freepost) Who could think of any place more safe and dull than Milton Keynes? But as teenagers Rev, Lucy and Scott while away the summer, an invisible enemy is heading their way. Soon the town is in the grip of a deadly virus that causes its victims to haemorrhage to death. The army is called in, part of the town is turned into a ghetto and tensions between different parts of the community reach breaking point as scientists race against time to find a cure. This is not the most literary of novels, but it is a compulsive page turner that would grip even the most reluctant reader, with its jump-cut style reminiscent of popular TV series. It even succeeds in making viral science seem sexy, which is no mean feat. Young American Jeff Gomez (Scholastic, \u00a35.99; CultureShop price, \u00a35.99 freepost) A rites-of-passage novel, narrated by 14-year-old Perry, who comes not just from a broken home but one with \"multiple fractures\". When, after her latest divorce, Perry's mum uproots him yet again, he finds himself spending another summer in a strange town with no friends. Gomez's relaxed, low-key style doesn't exactly race, but it is sharply observant as it charts the story of an outsider who desperately wants to belong. It captures that moment in adolescence when you are no longer a child but still not an adult and view the adult world with a mixture of confusion and clarity. Perry's brother's strange, troubled marriage, his mum's anxieties at letting go and Perry's dangerous dabblings at playing an adult never ring less than true.",

In his campaign speech, Mr Hague insisted that while there is no place in a civilised society for vigilantes the law must meet the demands of \"natural justice\". \"Politicians aren't doing their job if they don't listen and respond to the unprecedented public outcry which has greeted the murder conviction for this Norfolk farmer who was defending his home against burglars,\" he said. \"I understand that outcry and I share it.\" The prime minister, visiting Watford, Hertfordshire, as part of the local election campaign, refused today to make any direct comment on Mr Hague's proposal or on the Martin case. \"I remind the Conservatives that when they were in power, crime doubled and in all their 18 years in office they never once introduced the rather vague measures they are now proposing,\" he told an audience of local councillors. At the weekend, government sources more resources could be made available for policing isolated rural areas in chancellor Gordon Brown's July spending review.",

This 10% are at much greater risk of abusing drugs, having health problems, being involved in criminal activity and being long-term unemployed,\" Goodman says. </p> <p>One of the most striking findings of the research was the relationship between social class and mental health.

Similarly, 14% of children with mental disorders came from families in social class V (unskilled occupations), while the figure for those from professional families (social class I) was just 5%. </p> <p>Mental disorders in children were twice as likely in lone parent families, compared with those with two parents (16% and 8%). Similarly, incidences were much more common when the primary care giver, usually the mother, had no educational qualifications (15%) compared with those that had been to university (6%). </p> <p>Twice as many children with a mental health problem had a parent with a similar problem, such as anxiety or depression (47% and 23%), and affected children were also twice as likely to come from broken families. </p> <p>Goodman says the research had not tried to determine the causes of mental illness in children, and this would require a different type of study. Rather, he says, the Department of Health commissioned the study to help it design services for children with serious mental health problems. \"Inner city areas with a high number of poor single parent families in social housing need a lot more money for services, because there will be more chil dren needing help,\" he says. \"In the recent past, money has been moved away from, for instance, inner London and out into more rural areas probably more than was justified, because inner city areas have much more deprived populations.\" </p> <p>He hoped that the findings would lead to the government providing more funding to areas that needed better mental health services and said its commit- ment to tackling social exclusion suggested action would be taken.

Why should people have to take a morning off work to have a routine test? What other services today insist on, at best, a nine-to-five schedule? </p> <p>At the Queen Mary's MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) unit, such questions have already been addressed. The scanner is operating from 8am to 10pm three days a week and to 8pm on a fourth. And there is no shortage of evening patients. </p> <p>\"We've found very high interest in the evenings because it means no time off work,\" says Patrick Byrne, managing director of the company running the unit in partnership with the NHS trust. \"People say that their partners can look after the children and, interestingly, they can park. If you are driving to a hospital during normal clinic hours, it's just a nightmare.\" </p> <p>The company, Lodestone Patient Care, runs all seven of its MRI units at health service hospitals until 8pm most days. The success of the later hours piloted at Sidcup means it is considering following suit elsewhere. In a recent survey, more than half the 724 patients questioned at four units said they would be willing to attend between 8pm and midnight. </p> <p>There is, of course, an extra incentive for an MRI unit to operate long hours: the high cost of the equipment, and its limited life, make it prudent to get as much out of it as possible. </p> <p>Peter Barker, the lead consultant radiologist at Sidcup, says: \"There are key advantages to this approach. The whole set-up probably costs \u00a32m and the machine itself \u00a3800,000. It's a lot of money for an NHS trust to find if you cannot guarantee to use it 10 sessions or more a week.\" </p> <p>Then there is the question of the unit's semi-private status. Could such \"out of hours\" working be replicated in the mainstream NHS, or is it something achievable only outside the restrictions of health service labour agreements? </p> <p>Lodestone began life when Byrne, who was something in the City, was asked by his brother - a consultant neuro-radiologist at Atkinson Morley's hospital in Wimbledon, south London - to help raise money to buy a scanner. Byrne found venture funding on the basis that the MRI unit, opened in 1992, would be sited at the hospital, and would contract to it, but would also see private patients. Across the now seven units,74% of patients are NHS and 26% private. </p> <p>\"Patient care is fundamental to what we do and we didn't like the way patients were being treated generally,\" says Byrne. \"We said we would take the risk, put the kit in, but come up with a better service.\" </p> <p>Part of this commitment is the extended hours arrangement at Sidcup - a response in itself to findings from the company's annual patient survey. The unit initially offered appointments through to midnight, but experience showed that demand tailed off in the last two hours. The 10pm finish has now been made permanent. </p> <p> Lesley Harmes, a radiographer who manages the unit, says: \"We started off thinking it would be mainly private patients who would want the flexibility of a later appointment. But we've found it popular across the board: the last two or three tonight will be private, but that's not always the case.\" </p> <p>Patients attend for scanning of everything from a sports injury to the potential for brain surgery. Although there is always a \"crash\" team on hand in the hospital, Harmes admits that evening work tends to the routine and that more complex cases are usually dealt with during the day, when the unit is more fully staffed. </p> <p>Working to 10pm is now reflected modestly in staff pay, says Harmes. But of more importance is a flexibility of attitude that could prove difficult to establish in the NHS itself. \"This week I have worked a few extra hours,\" she says, \"so I will finish at about 2pm on Friday so that I get the time back.\" </p> <p>Lodestone argues that being more customer friendly pays dividends. It says the average waiting time for a non-urgent NHS scan at its units is between eight and 12 weeks, compared to between eight and 12 months in some other areas, and it points to a failure rate - where the patient refuses to go into the scanner or panics and demands to come out - of less than 0.5%, compared to up to 5% elsewhere. </p> <p>According to the company's latest survey, 85% of patients classed their appointment as better than other hospital visits. Yet, fascinatingly, 44% were unaware that the unit is privately run.</p>",

Lodestone began life when Byrne, who was something in the City, was asked by his brother - a consultant neuro-radiologist at Atkinson Morley's hospital in Wimbledon, south London - to help raise money to buy a scanner. Byrne found venture funding on the basis that the MRI unit, opened in 1992, would be sited at the hospital, and would contract to it, but would also see private patients. Across the now seven units,74% of patients are NHS and 26% private. \"Patient care is fundamental to what we do and we didn't like the way patients were being treated generally,\" says Byrne. \"We said we would take the risk, put the kit in, but come up with a better service.\" Part of this commitment is the extended hours arrangement at Sidcup - a response in itself to findings from the company's annual patient survey. The unit initially offered appointments through to midnight, but experience showed that demand tailed off in the last two hours. The 10pm finish has now been made permanent. Lesley Harmes, a radiographer who manages the unit, says: \"We started off thinking it would be mainly private patients who would want the flexibility of a later appointment. But we've found it popular across the board: the last two or three tonight will be private, but that's not always the case.\" Patients attend for scanning of everything from a sports injury to the potential for brain surgery. Although there is always a \"crash\" team on hand in the hospital, Harmes admits that evening work tends to the routine and that more complex cases are usually dealt with during the day, when the unit is more fully staffed. Working to 10pm is now reflected modestly in staff pay, says Harmes. But of more importance is a flexibility of attitude that could prove difficult to establish in the NHS itself. \"This week I have worked a few extra hours,\" she says, \"so I will finish at about 2pm on Friday so that I get the time back.\" Lodestone argues that being more customer friendly pays dividends. It says the average waiting time for a non-urgent NHS scan at its units is between eight and 12 weeks, compared to between eight and 12 months in some other areas, and it points to a failure rate - where the patient refuses to go into the scanner or panics and demands to come out - of less than 0.5%, compared to up to 5% elsewhere. According to the company's latest survey, 85% of patients classed their appointment as better than other hospital visits. Yet, fascinatingly, 44% were unaware that the unit is privately run.",

Those jailed include Roger Saint, who was also a foster carer. </p> <p>\"Detection of abuse in foster care is likely to be at least as difficult as it is in any residential home,\" Sir Ronald Waterhouse, who carried out an extensive inquiry into the north Wales abuse, has said. \"The disincentive to complain is just as strong, if not stronger.\" </p> <p>Janet knows about that disincentive. She was six when the son of her foster parents began sexually abusing her.

Traditionally, young people went to the woods the night before May Day, to \"bring in the may\" and to find a maypole; grooving the dark earthy groves, vicarless and knickerless. \"Scarcely a third of maidens going to the woods returned home undefiled\", wrote one disapproving puritan. </p> <p>May Day is personification of spring and the Green Man gives a green light to revelry with his huge \"horn\" full of wine and suggestiveness.

The festivities were led by the Lord of Misrule, the King of Unreason and the Abbot of Disobedience. </p> <p>It was also a day for the common people to celebrate common time on common land. They celebrated their rites on the land and also celebrated their rights to that land. </p> <p>First came the enclosures. Hundreds of folk festivals and carnivals disappeared with these acts of parliament which robbed people of their rights, and their sites of carnival. Then came the puritans. Hating the social reversal of carnival and sniffing the rank sexuality of the day (they decried the maypole as \"this stinking idol\"), the puritans banned May Day in 1644. </p> <p>Over the following centuries, just as land was literally enclosed so the spirit of carnival time was metaphorically enclosed: no drinking, no bawdiness, no sex. For carnival was vulgar in two senses; it was rude, for sure, and it was also vulgar in a class context because it was of the common people. Nothing irritated the Victorian rising middle classes more than seeing commoners having a jovial pie-eating, procreating piss-up in public. </p> <p>For the factories and mills of the industrial revolution, \"time off\" was disastrous, so holidays were massively reduced and working hours dramatically increased. May Day then became a focus for campaigns to reduce working hours. A general strike was held across the US and Canada on May Day 1886. After a rally on May 4, eight anarchists were hanged for calling for an eight-hour working day.

The other, frowned on by the media and the authorities, is a profound upholding of tradition - such as Reclaim The Streets doing some guerrilla gardening in Parliament Square. The traditional Mayday is all about the sexy, earthy, horizontal plane of copulation, not about virginal choristers in a vertical tower. </p> <p>The quality of universality of May Day - from the commoners celebrating common time on common land, to the internationalism of May Day in labour terms - is represented today in the People's Global Action and in focusing protests against organisations like the WTO, IMF and the World Bank which traduce the rights of common people across the world. </p> <p>Protesting against corporations which destroy the natural environment looks back to Beltane's pagan roots.

He hacked through the undergrowth to plant them, in soil so heavy that people had given up trying to grow vegetables on it. </p> <p>Along a cycle path, his friend Bethan has harvested some chives, which may or may not be those she planted a year or two ago. The cherries and plums that thrive along the path end up as jam. And all over the city, derelict land is sprouting, where people like Mike and Bethan have planted everything from apple trees to strawberries. </p> <p>The same is happening in many British cities - including Brighton, Bradford, Manchester, Sheffield and London - and in cities the world over. Wherever derelict urban land can be brought back to life as green space, the guerrilla gardeners can work. </p> <p>\"People go out and plant stuff where there are no trees,\" said Ben, another Bristol activist. \"Willows are simple to do on a large scale: you push willow sticks in the ground and you can get a 40% success rate. Some people just drift through, plant and then move on.\" </p> <p>Mike, who has taught permaculture for 20 years, says: \"The idea of doing something on someone else's land takes vast amounts of control out of people's hands, but it's perfectly natural that you should want to improve your environment. People around the world manage their resources without having ownership of them, so it's strange that guerrilla gardening is seen as subversive.\" </p> <p>Guerrilla gardening - so named after the Green Guerrillas, who pioneered it in New York in the 1980s - is not a new idea. Gypsies have practised it for generations, planting potatoes by a roadside, moving on, and returning to collect their crop. But now it has become politicised. Gardening is direct action: it can reassert people's rights over their land, revive urban communities, and seize back control of the food supply from multinationals. </p> <p>As a movement, it is vague and made up of many disparate groups. But its aims are clear: to reconnect people to their land and produce food from it, using local resources and a minimum of energy. Rather than buying apples flown from Chile, you can grow your own where you live. In place of individual gardens, community ones; in place of monoculture, diversity; and in place of consumption, production. A conventional garden consumes energy, chemicals and fertilisers made from fossil fuels, but an organic one recycles everything. </p> <p>Guerrilla gardening has grown naturally from other environmental direct action, such as anti-roads protests, and involves many of the same people. \"Some activists decided it was better to come down off the trees and grow vegetables,\" says Sophie Andrews, of Bristol Friends of the Earth. \"They have moved round to more positive actions rather than just saying no.\" </p> <p>Now the guerrilla gardeners have gone global. On May Day, the direct action group Reclaim the Streets, under the slogan \"Resistance is Fertile\", will hold planting events in London, Manchester, Belfast, Bristol and Brighton as part of a global day of action against capitalism. Earlier this month, similar actions took place in Washington, at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank summit. As one US instruction leaflet said: \"We must do it creatively enough that they cannot credibly label us as terrorists, and militantly enough that we cannot be ignored.\" </p> <p> This has taken guerrilla gardening beyond the local context and into the arena of challenging capitalism and consumption. Jack Tann, of Reclaim the Streets, says: \"It is not just green; it is also symbolic of taking back the land under people's feet - land they have to buy or rent - and breaking up the alienating cycle of producers and consumers. It represents the idea that people have the power and right to decide how they live. We do not have to live in this ugly and constrained way under capitalism.\" </p> <p>It all started in New York, where, in the blighted, brownish landscape of Manhattan's lower east side, a group called the Green Guerrillas began to plant gardens among the burnt-out slum tenements. What began as squats by activists and poor residents eventually became full-blown community gardens. </p> <p>Local traditions and ethnic minorities flourished. In some gardens, central American immigrants reproduced the conditions of their home villages, keeping chickens, building huts and drinking beer with their friends on hot days. Thus communities were given the power to control their environment, even though, under the zero tolerance regime of the city's Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, many of their activities were criminalised. </p> <p>Puerto Ricans, Anglo-Saxons, Dominicans, Colombians, Poles and many other groups planted and worked together, painted murals, secured grants. They held poetry readings and jazz concerts. </p> <p>The gardens spread throughout Manhattan and up to the Bronx, until they numbered close to 1,000 in the city as a whole. But they were victims of their own success. As areas were improved so they became safer and, eventually, gentrified. Once the land underneath a garden had become attractive to build on, the garden was threatened. A series of planning battles followed in the late 1990s, and a number of gardens were bulldozed and destroyed. Nevertheless, New York's guerrilla gardening movement has demonstrated what can be achieved. Many hundreds of gardens survive, and many have sprung up in other cities, including San Francisco and Vancouver. </p> <p>The US experience helped inspire the growth of community gardens in Britain. As in New York, many began with squatting, or a local community fighting to keep green waste land. Among the earliest were the Calthorpe Street project on a derelict site near King's Cross, a deprived area of inner London, and the Windmill Hill city farm in Bristol. Here and in many other places what was started by activists brought lasting benefits to a whole community. </p> <p>Community gardens - and city farms, which are similar but with livestock - are booming in Britain, unlike allotments, which are declining as interest wanes. There are now 518 community gardens, run by volunteers, and 68 farms. Tellingly, more than a third are in the 33 most deprived districts in England. Of the remainder, many are in deprived pockets in more affluent areas. </p> <p>Between them, they provide green space for more than 300,000 people. But like those in New York, they may also be threatened by development. As the government tries to find space for millions of extra homes on \"brownfield\" sites within cities, the gardens are soft targets for developers. Judging from experience, even the most dedicated activists may be powerless to stop the bulldozers.</p> <p><strong>Useful websites</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reclaimthestreets.net\">Reclaim the Streets</a> <br><a href=\"http://freedom.tao.ca/aggard.html\">Guerrilla Gardens and Urban Ecology</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.autonomedia.org\">Avant Gardening</a></p>",

As one US instruction leaflet said: \"We must do it creatively enough that they cannot credibly label us as terrorists, and militantly enough that we cannot be ignored.\" This has taken guerrilla gardening beyond the local context and into the arena of challenging capitalism and consumption. Jack Tann, of Reclaim the Streets, says: \"It is not just green; it is also symbolic of taking back the land under people's feet - land they have to buy or rent - and breaking up the alienating cycle of producers and consumers. It represents the idea that people have the power and right to decide how they live. We do not have to live in this ugly and constrained way under capitalism.\" It all started in New York, where, in the blighted, brownish landscape of Manhattan's lower east side, a group called the Green Guerrillas began to plant gardens among the burnt-out slum tenements. What began as squats by activists and poor residents eventually became full-blown community gardens. Local traditions and ethnic minorities flourished. In some gardens, central American immigrants reproduced the conditions of their home villages, keeping chickens, building huts and drinking beer with their friends on hot days. Thus communities were given the power to control their environment, even though, under the zero tolerance regime of the city's Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, many of their activities were criminalised. Puerto Ricans, Anglo-Saxons, Dominicans, Colombians, Poles and many other groups planted and worked together, painted murals, secured grants. They held poetry readings and jazz concerts. The gardens spread throughout Manhattan and up to the Bronx, until they numbered close to 1,000 in the city as a whole. But they were victims of their own success. As areas were improved so they became safer and, eventually, gentrified. Once the land underneath a garden had become attractive to build on, the garden was threatened. A series of planning battles followed in the late 1990s, and a number of gardens were bulldozed and destroyed. Nevertheless, New York's guerrilla gardening movement has demonstrated what can be achieved. Many hundreds of gardens survive, and many have sprung up in other cities, including San Francisco and Vancouver. The US experience helped inspire the growth of community gardens in Britain. As in New York, many began with squatting, or a local community fighting to keep green waste land. Among the earliest were the Calthorpe Street project on a derelict site near King's Cross, a deprived area of inner London, and the Windmill Hill city farm in Bristol. Here and in many other places what was started by activists brought lasting benefits to a whole community. Community gardens - and city farms, which are similar but with livestock - are booming in Britain, unlike allotments, which are declining as interest wanes. There are now 518 community gardens, run by volunteers, and 68 farms. Tellingly, more than a third are in the 33 most deprived districts in England. Of the remainder, many are in deprived pockets in more affluent areas. Between them, they provide green space for more than 300,000 people. But like those in New York, they may also be threatened by development. As the government tries to find space for millions of extra homes on \"brownfield\" sites within cities, the gardens are soft targets for developers. Judging from experience, even the most dedicated activists may be powerless to stop the bulldozers. Useful websites Reclaim the Streets Guerrilla Gardens and Urban Ecology Avant Gardening",

There are a lot of very public-spirited people out there and the public generally has always hankered for more bobbies on the beat. </p> <p>\"In fact, the chances of a beat bobby catching a burglar in the act are fairly remote, unless he's acting on prior information.

Today's afternoon promenade is in response to a specific outbreak of daylight robberies. This is the fifth such patrol, so it's too early to draw any conclusions about the likely deterrent effect. Perhaps it's a coincidence that the figures for domestic burglaries in Harborne are down from 256 to175 - a drop of 32%. But that's since last April. The volunteers' initiative only started in December. The effects of deterrence, unlike detection, are impossible to gauge.

So at the very least, Pearson's patch is off to a flying start in the context of a West Midlands force where the overall drop in burglaries over the same period is 5%.

Dogged determination: Staff at a veterinary centre in Newcastle upon Tyne treated a dog which limped in on its own after being hit by a car. Job lot: A host of job vacancies have arisen on the Hebridean island of Gigha following the retirement of a man who held 14 positions, ranging from policeman and fireman to pier master and undertaker. Parental concern: The parents of a woman who had phoned to say she was going into labour arrived at the hospital in Whiston, Merseyside, in an ambulance after the mother fell downstairs and the father suffered a panic attack. Living dangerously: An endangered species of shrimp is thriving on Salisbury Plain army training area, Wiltshire, in water- filled ruts carved out by tanks. Heady brew: A further education college in Plymouth is soon to have its own brewery for students on a course in beer making. Mass appeal: Health and safety officials at Manchester city council have warned the priest of a church in Chorlton-cum-Hardy to restrict the size of his congregations for mass because of the danger of overcrowding. Tall order: A builder who created a 43-foot obelisk at his home in Great Rissington, Gloucestershire, in memory of his late wife has been ordered to scale it down following complaints by neighbours. Morris major: A group of Morris dancers formed the guard of honour at the wedding in Colchester, Essex, of a Morris Minor restorer named Morris. Harry's shame: The head of a primary school in Chatham, Kent, has banned pupils from reading J K Rowling's Harry Potter books because she claims they go against the Bible's teaching.

      "body": "<b>Steven, you seem like a decent bloke. Surely, especially given your recent utterances, it's time for you to leave the Conservative party?</b> <br> <b>Angela</b> <br> No, I still have every intention of working hard to make the Conservative party as attractive to ethnic minorities as I believe it should be. I have a very good relationship with William Hague. He is a decent, fair minded man and I know he believes as I do that equality is indivisible. If I ever thought the Tories were either racist or homophobic I would leave the party. Sadly, every political party has its share of bigots but I don't believe the Conservatives are particularly over represented in that category! <b>If you couldn't control transport, still less control your trousers, how are you going to control one of the biggest cities in the world?</b> <br> <b>Paul King</b> <br> Do you really expect a serious answer to such a pathetically sniggering 14-year-old question. My strong advice is to get outdoors more and find a girlfriend. Mind you, could take you some time. <b>How will Steven accommodate or facilitate for the growing business demands in the City? Particularly in terms of building heights and floorplate sizes. Can we expect Manhattan?</b> <br> <b>Ben Wrighton</b> <br> I have no problem with tall buildings in appropriate locations and broadly, I do see the City accommodating increasing densities. It may not be Manhattan but over the next 10 years we have to keep pace with the demands of business and Docklands will not be able to absorb all the capacity we are likely to generate. On a related issue I do believe we have to look at residential densities if we are going to increase the amount of affordable housing in this city. It is an irony that Georgian terraces are far more dense than modern two storey semis. With good design we can raise heights, increase density and make the city more attractive at the same time. <b>1. You say you will increase the London weighting. Good. But by how much? Clearly if it's going to allow public sector workers to buy home sit will need to be a very substantial rise.<p>2. Brownfield development; high density housing; protection of green belt. Fine words indeed. Will you support the policy of the Empty homes agency to reduce VAT on refurbishment from 17.5% and equalise it vis a vis new homes? I'm not asking if you agree in principle with this but whether you will promise to do it?</p></b> <p><b>3. You seem to be opposed to all social housing and your desire for an audit of council housing sounds suspiciously like a plan for a sell-off. This feeling is strengthened by your commitment to a right-to-buy drive. Can you explain in greater detail how your plan of PPP will provide the necessary affordable houses?</b><br><b>Michael O'Flynn</b><br> 1.London weighting needs to be increased to a maximum of \u00a36,000 as compared to the current ceiling of \u00a33,000. To do this for police officers (post Sheehey) teachers and other public sector workers in London will cost around \u00a3820m. This represents a tiny proportion of the funds London is currently denied by the Barnett formula - around \u00a33.5bn. There is no short cut here. The Home Office accepts the problem exists and that something urgent must be done. 2. Yes. 3. You are quite wrong. I perfectly accept the value of social housing. I have no plans to campaign to sell any of it off. I don't know where you get this idea of \"my committment to a right to buy drive\" but it is news to me. Working with the housing corporation and the existing housing associations in London and putting them together with public sector employers and private sector funders can fund tied accomodation for example for key workers. <b>Steve, do you support William Hague and the Conservative party's policy of immediate detention of all asylum seekers?<br>Cedric</b><br>I certainly think we have to have a serious look at how the current policy is working. Is it reasonable to suggest that in a number of cases, whilst the motives of those applying are perfectly understandable, their claim to asylum status does not stand examination? Are there any circumstances in which those who do not qualify should be returned to whence they came? And if the answer to the above questions is yes, then is it not reasonable to deal with all applicants quickly and then ensure that the decisions are implemented? I think the answer to all three questions is yes. Every applicant is entitled to their dignity and to a fair and prompt hearing. It may be that in order to process applications efficiently applicants need to be directed to reception centres. If that is logistically necessary I would not shrink from it. What is very worrying to me is that the current position does appear to be damaging good community relations in London. When many boroughs are spending more on the problem than they are on their own elderly population, and when housing waiting lists applicants see accomodation being allocated ahead of them they resent the burden. It is not the fault of the asylum seeker but it is most certainly an issue the government has to address urgently. <b>Do you not think that opposing the euro outright is unhelpful for the City's balancing act of maintaining importance while staying outside? <br>Brian Wolfe</b><br> No. You will be aware that the London Chamber of Commerce research has satisfied them, and many others, that there are no adverse consequences for the City deriving from our not joining the euro. My objections are economic and constitutional. They are most certainly not anti-european.<br><b>Can you let me know what your thoughts are on people who email questions to you when they should be working? Would you lock them all up in one of Mr Hagues camps?<br>Jonathan</b><br>Ha ha. Yeah. Actually I can't answer all the questions coming in but I am really impressed by the quality. There are some very bright Guardian readers out there.<br><br><b>What is the mayor actually going to be able to do? You all talk sensibly about crime, transport, jobs and free sweets for everyone. What makes you think you'll have any effect as mayor when your party so signally failed in government to implement any of these improvements for Londoners?<br> Simon Paley</b><br>There is a real difference between what a junior minister can do (very little in reality) and what a mayor can do with real executive authority. It is not about money alone. As a minister you advise organisations like LT, you answer for them when things go wrong and you try to take the credit when things go right, but ultimately it's their call. As mayor if you don't like what LT management is doing, you change them. Get it wrong and you alone are to blame. Get it right and you deserve to get the credit. <br><br><b>How is Mr Norris going to deal with spiralling house RENTAL prices in the capital?<br>Rory Cook</b><br>Not easy but I believe that you can make progress in at least two ways. First, we have to review London weighting to allow public servants to keep pace with the massive increase in freehold values and rents. Second, we have to make more affordable housing available, both tied to key public sector workers (teachers, nurses, police) and for more general consumption. There is one way this can be done without massive injections of cash (which is any event push prices up even further) and that is to insist on better design, greater density and a higher proportion from the developer made available to appropriate nominating housing associations, local authorities, etc. <br><br><b>How can he expect anyone to take him seriously when his own political party originally rejected him as a mayoral candidate only to backtrack because there were few other options open to them? <br> Pete Leary</b><br>I'll tell you why Pete. Whatever the farce over Archer, my party leader and members insisted on an open one member, one vote process even where this might embarrass a candidate. In the event I got more than a good majority - better than three to one - of Tory party members in London. That's good enough for me, but more importantly it was clearly good enough for the party too. I have had tremendous support from party rank and file who will be working for me in large numbers everyday between now and May 4 in parts of London Ken Livingstone would hardly recognise. By contrast the incompetent, corrupt, cynical brutality of the Labour process has resulted in no one out there working for Frank, while Ken, the ultimate Zone One candidate, simply has no organisation capable of turning the vote out. Perhaps that's why he was so obviously rattled last night on TV, warning his supporters of the danger of my nicking the prize after all. Believe me, he's right to be worried.</p> <p><b>Will you keep Routemaster buses?<br>Paul Gailey</b><br>Yes, love them.</p> <p>Thanks for the questions. Sorry I can't answer more, but I'm off to the southern states (Wimbledon to you) to meet some more very happy supporters.</p> <p>Steve.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kevin Spacey's move into more mainstream, user-friendly comedy continues today with the news that the double Oscar-winning actor is currently in negotiations to star in MGM's long-planned remake of The Pink Panther. The 40-year-old star would play the blundering, self-conscious French cop Inspector Clouseau - a role made famous by the great Peter Sellers. But MGM vice-president Chris McGurk hastens to put out that these negotiations are still at a fledgling stage. \"Currently he is not attached,\" McGurk admits. \"But we are in discussions with Kevin Spacey.\" The Pink Panther remake will be produced by Ivan Reitman and will begin shooting at the end of year. However, it looks set to struggle to find a window in Spacey's increasingly hectic schedule, which includes a starring role in the adaptation of E Annie Proulx's The Shipping News and an as yet untitled romantic comedy that he will also produce. The original Pink Panther picture was filmed back in 1963 and followed the fortunes of Clouseau as he hunted a debonair cat burglar (David Niven) who had swiped a priceless jewel. The film was so successful that it inspired a long-running TV cartoon and seven sequels. Even Sellers, who succumbed to a heart attack in 1980, found that death was no barrier to further adventures. The last Pink Panther film - 1982's The Trail of the Pink Panther - was pieced together with out-takes from his previous pictures. \u0095 Would Spacey make a good Clouseau?

His aides have therefore been preening themselves this morning as they survey the front pages which are all dominated by Mr Hague's pledge to change the law to give greater protection to people who are forced to defend themselves against burglars. Tony Blair grabbed the headlines with policy announcements while in opposition and we are just following his example, goes the thinking among members of the Hague inner circle. Unfortunately for Mr Hague there are two crucial differences between the Labour party in the run-up to the general election of 1997 and today's Conservative party. All of New Labour's major policy changes were announced after a lengthy period of work in which they were tested on countless focus groups and subjected to rigorous tests to assess how much they would cost. The policies were also designed to reach out to voters in the centre ground where Mr Blair knew the election would be won. Mr Hague's speech today, which follows hard on the heels of his pledge to lock up all asylum seekers, appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to the outcry over the jailing of Tony Martin. The farmer has barely been in jail for a week and the Tory leader has announced a major change in the law which would introduce a \"strong presumption\" in favour of people forced to defend their homes. Unlike Labour's efforts to reach out to new voters, Mr Hague's speech appears to have been inspired by an outcry in the rightwing press and among his own backbenchers. Labour and the Liberal Democrats wasted little time in condemning the speech, with one Labour MP accusing the Tory leader of fostering a \"lynch mob mentality\". But in a sign of how far Mr Hague has lurched to the right, a chief constable was also moved to criticise his plans. Northumbria's Crispian Strachan said that Mr Hague's proposed change in the law would lead to a \"serious increase in violent crime\". The Hague inner circle will be unmoved by such remarks.

At least EW Swanton and Godfrey Evans - remembered here by their friends John Woodcock and Colin Cowdrey respectively - lived sufficiently long that you smile at the tributes to them. Swanton, at 92, had the distinction of having also written a piece (on Wisden's editors of the century) which appears in the same edition as the posthumous appreciation of him.</p> <p>Amid these saddening dismissals, the one consolation is that the fine playwright Peter Tinniswood - who added to cricket literature with the Brigadier - recovered sufficiently from his recent grave illnesses to contribute an entertaining book review in which he dares, among other things, to criticise Dickens.</p> <p>The edition which takes leave of the century also announces another departure. Matthew Engel - who has brought more mischief, literary merit and marketing zeal to Wisden than it has ever had - leaves his post for at least a year, his predecessor Graeme Wright coming in as a runner.</p> <p>Engel's editor's notes for 2000 contain the usual mixture of high-class polemic (cricket in schools, the use of painkillers by bowlers, the amount of driving required of players) and good jokes: the sloppy nostalgia of a Lord MacLaurin speech is lethally deconstructed.</p> <p>The rules allow Engel to return - there is an asterisk beside his score of eight - and we must hope he does. Retired tired. But also, on this evidence, triumphant. </p> <p><em> Mark Lawson is a columnist on the Guardian and the presenter of BBC2's Review and Radio 4's Front Row</em></p>",

At least EW Swanton and Godfrey Evans - remembered here by their friends John Woodcock and Colin Cowdrey respectively - lived sufficiently long that you smile at the tributes to them. Swanton, at 92, had the distinction of having also written a piece (on Wisden's editors of the century) which appears in the same edition as the posthumous appreciation of him. Amid these saddening dismissals, the one consolation is that the fine playwright Peter Tinniswood - who added to cricket literature with the Brigadier - recovered sufficiently from his recent grave illnesses to contribute an entertaining book review in which he dares, among other things, to criticise Dickens. The edition which takes leave of the century also announces another departure. Matthew Engel - who has brought more mischief, literary merit and marketing zeal to Wisden than it has ever had - leaves his post for at least a year, his predecessor Graeme Wright coming in as a runner. Engel's editor's notes for 2000 contain the usual mixture of high-class polemic (cricket in schools, the use of painkillers by bowlers, the amount of driving required of players) and good jokes: the sloppy nostalgia of a Lord MacLaurin speech is lethally deconstructed. The rules allow Engel to return - there is an asterisk beside his score of eight - and we must hope he does. Retired tired. But also, on this evidence, triumphant.

There's surely no way back to the England team now for Lewis, who got a taste of how low his stock had sunk when he was booed from the field after being run out for 0 for Leicestershire against Lancashire on Monday. The two-division County Championship, which starts today, should have been his chance to remind the selectors and the public that he is not a spent force, but in fact a better all rounder than Craig White, who has been given an England contract. I wonder about Lewis\u00d5s state of mind, especially given his short and ill-advised strike to protest his treatment by Lord MacLaurin and co. For Clairmonte Christopher Lewis, the season looks over before it's properly begun. </p> <p>Lewis has been accused time and again of not delivering the goods for England. It's a cruel irony that, as he tells it, a bent bookie asked him literally to deliver. The ECB should take a leaf out of the book of the South Africans, who acted swiftly in the case of Hansie Cronje. The three players should immediately be summoned to a hearing along with Lewis. The board should then clear up the question of whether he did make the same allegations last year. If the evidence he presents is credible, they should consider suspending the players pending a full investigation. This in turn should be part of a wider inquiry by the ICC into a) the extent to which bookies pay players for information on pitch conditions and the like, and b) the extent of real match-fixing. We know match-fixing is illegal and players who are found guilty should be banned for life. Tough, uniform new penalties should be introduced for taking payment from bookmakers. It's not criminal, but it tarnishes the sport. </p> <p>The way it looks, for the moment anyway, is that West Indies appear to be the only one of the major cricketing nations untouched by the whole affair. But it's unlikely that the bookies would have approached the likes of Cronje, Shane Warne, Mark Waugh and, apparently, several Pakistanis and not done the same to West Indies players. When I spoke with Clive Lloyd shortly after the Cronje story broke, he told me that to his knowledge none of his players was approached while he was captain or manager (a job he held until a few months ago). He was sure the players would have told him and in any case, he told me confidently, he was sure such approaches would have been dismissed out of hand. Lloyd is certain the drip-drip of allegations and revelations \"is destroying the game of cricket\", and is in favour of the ICC holding a full and wide-ranging investigation. </p> <p>How might a player get tapped? Functions such as sponsors' parties and receptions are now important off-field activities for the players, and Lloyd believes it is not that hard to get their mobile phone numbers. Journalists routinely get the their numbers that way. Unfortunately, it seems we're not the only ones who can. I'm less confident than Clive that everyone who might have approached a player would have been shooed away. Cricketers earn very little compared to other professional sportsmen. Shane Warne will take home \u00a3750,000 after his season with Hampshire, but most of that will be in sponsorship. Footballers at the low end of the pay scale in the English Premiership can earn close to half-a-million a year. A footballer who has as much stature as Warne in his game can expect to earn at least five times that. And let's not even talk about what basketball players earn in the NBA. The point is that cricketers are sensitive to issues of pay, as the Windies players showed when they almost wrecked their tour of South Africa before it started 18 months ago, with their Heathrow stand-off. When they finally did face Cronje's men, they lost the Test series 5-0 and the one-day series 6-1. Yeah, I know what you'd be thinking now: how did they win that one match when they were so mind-numbingly awful throughout the tour? I thought and still think Cronje's captaincy was a great example of ruthlessly, even chillingly, professional leadership. His opponents had even begun to inspire pity, but he never let up.

      "body": "<p>In the year that has passed since 10,000 Falun Gong devotees surrounded the vermilion walls of the Chinese leadership's headquarters next to the Forbidden City in Beijing and demanded an end to official persecution of their sect, two things have happened: Falun Gong has demonstrated that it has both a tenacious organisation worldwide and deep roots in China, and the Chinese government has made itself look ridiculous.</p> <p>On July 22 last year, the persecution that Falun Gong had complained of became an article of faith at the highest level of the state as police raided the homes of practitioners across the country and arrested such leaders as they could get their hands on. Falun Gong reacted with demonstrations in 30 cities. The government responded with more arrests. Yesterday the group succeeded in pulling off another demonstration in Tiananmen Square, despite a large police presence dedicated to preventing it.</p> <p>Twelve months after resolving publicly to eliminate Falun Gong, the Chinese government has an embarrassing failure on its hands. According to the movement's own figures, 35,000 followers have been arrested and 5,000 sent to labour camps - a form of detention that the Chinese authorities call \"administrative\" and which does not, therefore, require a court trial. These figures are not verifiable, but the minority who have been tried in formal courts have received sentences of up to 18 years in prison. Falun Gong practitioners also risk losing their jobs and now their university places.</p> <p>What is the point of all this? According to government propaganda, Falun Gong is a politically motivated movement that has as its aim the overthrow of the Chinese government. Yet the government has failed to produce a scrap of evidence of any such conspiracy.</p> <p>It is worth remembering that, just 10 years ago, the same government was going out of its way to promote belief in the kind of qigong practice that is now condemned as superstitious. Casting around for some diversion for a nation stunned by the Tiananmen massacre, the Communist party fell upon qigong because they saw it as apolitical, autochthonous and good for health. These were qualities that appealed strongly to a government that had no political message beyond the promise that it would always be in power and was prepared to shoot anyone who said otherwise.</p> <p>But what the Falun Gong affair demonstrates is that, to a morally and ideologically bankrupt government, there is no safe activity. The threat did not even lie in the message that those 10,000 protesters who encircled Zhongnanhai a year ago were delivering, but in the fact that they were there at all. They were not the usual suspects - the political activists and dissidents whose names figure on China's police computers and whose movements and contacts are constantly watched. These were ordinary citizens: pensioners, housewives, small time clerks, party members, a cross section of Chinese society with only their passion for Falun Gong in common.</p> <p>Falun Gong followers, of course, supported last week's attempt by the United States to censure China in the UN commission on human rights. The Chinese government promptly accused Falun Gong of being \"a new tool for anti-China elements in the United States\". The idea that even the most fervent of such \"anti-China elements\" could conjure tens of thousands of demonstrators out of the air in China is simply laughable.</p> <p>Falun Gong is the most dramatic and widely publicised case of repression in the past year, but it is not the only one. At least five other qigong movements have been targeted in the same period, among them Zhong Gong, a group that last year claimed 38m followers in China and had centres across the country. Zhong Gong representatives complain that 600 of its followers have been detained, that group assets worth \u00a350m (810m yuan) have been seized and that 400,000 workers have lost their jobs after the government closed down more than 3,000 Zhong Gong centres. The government has not tried to suggest that Zhong Gong is trying to overthrow it, but like Falun Gong, it is entirely too appealing.</p> <p>Last week's human rights resolution failed, as have all attempts to censure China in that forum, because too many governments, including the British one, believe in chasing crocks of gold at the end of Chinese rainbows.</p> <p>But those governments that will do anything to do business with China might care to reflect on why the Chinese government is so scared of qigong. The men who run China understand that their people think that a faith in deep breathing and visiting aliens is at least as good a bet as believing any of the promises made by the government and the Communist party.

      "bodyText": "In the year that has passed since 10,000 Falun Gong devotees surrounded the vermilion walls of the Chinese leadership's headquarters next to the Forbidden City in Beijing and demanded an end to official persecution of their sect, two things have happened: Falun Gong has demonstrated that it has both a tenacious organisation worldwide and deep roots in China, and the Chinese government has made itself look ridiculous. On July 22 last year, the persecution that Falun Gong had complained of became an article of faith at the highest level of the state as police raided the homes of practitioners across the country and arrested such leaders as they could get their hands on. Falun Gong reacted with demonstrations in 30 cities. The government responded with more arrests. Yesterday the group succeeded in pulling off another demonstration in Tiananmen Square, despite a large police presence dedicated to preventing it. Twelve months after resolving publicly to eliminate Falun Gong, the Chinese government has an embarrassing failure on its hands. According to the movement's own figures, 35,000 followers have been arrested and 5,000 sent to labour camps - a form of detention that the Chinese authorities call \"administrative\" and which does not, therefore, require a court trial. These figures are not verifiable, but the minority who have been tried in formal courts have received sentences of up to 18 years in prison. Falun Gong practitioners also risk losing their jobs and now their university places. What is the point of all this? According to government propaganda, Falun Gong is a politically motivated movement that has as its aim the overthrow of the Chinese government. Yet the government has failed to produce a scrap of evidence of any such conspiracy. It is worth remembering that, just 10 years ago, the same government was going out of its way to promote belief in the kind of qigong practice that is now condemned as superstitious. Casting around for some diversion for a nation stunned by the Tiananmen massacre, the Communist party fell upon qigong because they saw it as apolitical, autochthonous and good for health. These were qualities that appealed strongly to a government that had no political message beyond the promise that it would always be in power and was prepared to shoot anyone who said otherwise. But what the Falun Gong affair demonstrates is that, to a morally and ideologically bankrupt government, there is no safe activity. The threat did not even lie in the message that those 10,000 protesters who encircled Zhongnanhai a year ago were delivering, but in the fact that they were there at all. They were not the usual suspects - the political activists and dissidents whose names figure on China's police computers and whose movements and contacts are constantly watched. These were ordinary citizens: pensioners, housewives, small time clerks, party members, a cross section of Chinese society with only their passion for Falun Gong in common. Falun Gong followers, of course, supported last week's attempt by the United States to censure China in the UN commission on human rights. The Chinese government promptly accused Falun Gong of being \"a new tool for anti-China elements in the United States\". The idea that even the most fervent of such \"anti-China elements\" could conjure tens of thousands of demonstrators out of the air in China is simply laughable. Falun Gong is the most dramatic and widely publicised case of repression in the past year, but it is not the only one. At least five other qigong movements have been targeted in the same period, among them Zhong Gong, a group that last year claimed 38m followers in China and had centres across the country. Zhong Gong representatives complain that 600 of its followers have been detained, that group assets worth \u00a350m (810m yuan) have been seized and that 400,000 workers have lost their jobs after the government closed down more than 3,000 Zhong Gong centres. The government has not tried to suggest that Zhong Gong is trying to overthrow it, but like Falun Gong, it is entirely too appealing. Last week's human rights resolution failed, as have all attempts to censure China in that forum, because too many governments, including the British one, believe in chasing crocks of gold at the end of Chinese rainbows. But those governments that will do anything to do business with China might care to reflect on why the Chinese government is so scared of qigong. The men who run China understand that their people think that a faith in deep breathing and visiting aliens is at least as good a bet as believing any of the promises made by the government and the Communist party. If they can see it, why can't we? comment@theguardian.com Useful links Introduction to Falun Gong Falun Dafa",

      "body": "<b>Frank Dobson, Labour</b> <p> <b>Crime</b><br> Frank Dobson has made a \"crackdown\" on crime his priority, suggesting that police are soft on drug users and offering tough words demanding they confront drug use and drug dealers. More specifically, he promises that every Londoner will have a named police officer in their local area \"just as everyone has their own GP\". He also wants more \"community-based wardens\", the removal of racist graffiti within one day and use of \"anti-social behaviour orders\" to combat nuisance neighbours. </p> <p> <b>Racism and the police</b><br> \"It is imperative that the mayor and the police work in partnership with the black and ethnic minority communities to build trust and confidence and recruit more black and Asian police,\" Labour's candidate says. Mr Dobson's running mate, black broadcaster Trevor Phillips, will chair the Metropolitan Police Authority. </p> <p> <b>Equality issues</b><br> Mr Phillips will also head a task force on black and Asian unemployment, aiming to promote public sector jobs and training for young black and Asian people and encourage black and Asian-led businesses. </p> <p><b>Steven Norris, Conservative</b></p> <p> <b>Crime</b><br> As in almost all policy areas, Steven Norris's declared position is markedly to the left of official Conservative party policy. He says he will \"not prosecute those who use cannabis for medicinal purposes\", although he is on more traditional territory with his promises to \"rid London of the scourge of drug pushers and lobby for tougher sentences from the courts\". </p> <p> <b>Racism and the police</b><br> Mr Norris also promises to reverse the fall in police numbers in the capital since 1997 and increase the number of special constables and other civilian volunteers in the Met. Police racism will be tackled through a new complaints and disciplinary unit and targets will be set for recruitment from each London community.

      "bodyText": "Frank Dobson, Labour Crime Frank Dobson has made a \"crackdown\" on crime his priority, suggesting that police are soft on drug users and offering tough words demanding they confront drug use and drug dealers. More specifically, he promises that every Londoner will have a named police officer in their local area \"just as everyone has their own GP\". He also wants more \"community-based wardens\", the removal of racist graffiti within one day and use of \"anti-social behaviour orders\" to combat nuisance neighbours. Racism and the police \"It is imperative that the mayor and the police work in partnership with the black and ethnic minority communities to build trust and confidence and recruit more black and Asian police,\" Labour's candidate says. Mr Dobson's running mate, black broadcaster Trevor Phillips, will chair the Metropolitan Police Authority. Equality issues Mr Phillips will also head a task force on black and Asian unemployment, aiming to promote public sector jobs and training for young black and Asian people and encourage black and Asian-led businesses. Steven Norris, Conservative Crime As in almost all policy areas, Steven Norris's declared position is markedly to the left of official Conservative party policy. He says he will \"not prosecute those who use cannabis for medicinal purposes\", although he is on more traditional territory with his promises to \"rid London of the scourge of drug pushers and lobby for tougher sentences from the courts\". Racism and the police Mr Norris also promises to reverse the fall in police numbers in the capital since 1997 and increase the number of special constables and other civilian volunteers in the Met. Police racism will be tackled through a new complaints and disciplinary unit and targets will be set for recruitment from each London community. Daily crime figures will also be published.

The game's oldest enemy arrived right on cue to prevent a single ball being bowled before lunch in this country and to raise the prospect of a total washout at all venues. The Division One clash between Indian Test players Rahul Dravid and Saurav Ganguly and their respective teams Kent and Lancashire was put on hold by morning rain at Canterbury. Even wetter conditions at Trent Bridge saw Division Two hopefuls Nottinghamshire and Northamptonshire abandon day one of their championship season almost two hours before the scheduled start of play. It was the same story between Gloucestershire and Sussex at Bristol, where the decision to call off play for the day came at 10.15am. A 1pm inspection was planned at New Road - venue for Worcestershire's clash with Glamorgan - while back in Division One Derbyshire and Leicestershire were still clinging to the hope of an afternoon start if the rains relented at the Racecourse Ground. The day's remaining championship fixture between Somerset and county title-holders Surrey hinged on a 2pm inspection at Taunton. Oxford University and Warwickshire were in the same boat in the Parks - play abandoned by 11am - while Cambridge University and Essex were also unable to start but awaiting an improvement in the weather after lunch at Fenner's.

Phyllis Gardner, the young artist whose tempestuous affair with the patriot poet Churchill idolised as \"one of England's noblest sons\" only came to light when her 90-page memoirs were unearthed in the British Library, was an innocent who doggedly clung to her virginity. Brooke became so frustrated with her defence of her virtue that during an erotic encounter he pretended to strangle her, an experience she later confessed she had quite enjoyed. The discovery of the papers, locked away for 50 years at the request of Gardner's sister Delphis, confirmed the growing impression that Brooke was far from the noble martyr of myth but could be a cruel and manipulative cad, whose charisma and beauty allowed him to get away with murder. With poems such as the The Soldier, Brooke became the laureate of the generation lost in the first world war, his sanctity confirmed by his early death on the way to Gallipoli. Biographies and memoirs by his friends Eddie Marsh and Geoffrey Keynes cultivated this image of a pure and ethereal young man who sacrificed himself for his country. What they failed to mention was that Brooke was a lothario who at one stage, according to his most recent biographer, Nigel Jones, kept four relationships on the go at one time, was bisexual in his youth, and also managed to conduct affairs with two sisters simultaneously, without either of them knowing the full story.

Mr Clifford admitted yesterday that he had been stirring up the public outcry against Martin's conviction by supplying newspaper editors and journalists with stories and information about his client to ensure that the story \"had got a bloody good airing\". But he denied that he was behind the call to a local Norfolk radio station last week by a woman who claimed to have been a jury member. The caller - who did not go on air - spoke of how the trial had \"changed her life\", and how she felt \"frightened to leave her house\". The radio station, Broadland 102.4fm, insisted that the woman - it is still unclear whether she was genuine or a hoax caller - did not say she was intimidated or nobbled. Front pages But immediately Martin's lawyers and Mr Clifford himself started using those phrases and by the next morning they were splashed over the front pages of the tabloids. Mr Clifford said: \"In terms of the hype and media coverage I am very happy to put my hands up.

Isolated house The sentencing to life imprisonment of Martin after the shooting at his isolated Norfolk farmhouse has become the talking point in pubs and at dinner tables across the country. Martin, 55, was found guilty by a majority verdict of murdering 16-year-old Fred Barras and of attempting to murder Brendon Fearon, another burglar, with intent to cause bodily harm. The farmer had been the subject of threats and it emerged in court that a \u00a360,000 bounty was alleged to have been put on his head. For reasons of safety, jury members were identified by number and not name in court. Martin's lawyers will now lodge an appeal against his conviction on Friday and will ask for a number of documents from the trial relating to jury intimidation. Mr Makin said: \"We hope it will be dealt with as quickly as possible.\"",

      "bodyText": "Miami's Cuban exiles plunged deeper into isolation yesterday when a strike called to protest Saturday's forcible reunion of Elian Gonzalez with his father failed to paralyse the city. In the working class Cuban district of Little Havana, the strike was observed in full. Its restaurants, shops and cigar stores were all locked up and plastered with signs explaining the cause. One insurance company had rigged its electronic hoarding to read: \"Support Elian. Shame on Clinton.\" Along the normally bustling main thoroughfare, the loudest sounds were the horns of cars decorated in Cuban flags honking their support. The rest of Miami, however, functioned more or less as normal, highlighting the city's deep ethnic divide and the failure of its 800,000 Cubans to win the sympathy of its 1.3m Anglophone whites and blacks. The police force reported an almost 100% turnout for work, while the municipal and county governments said their services would not be seriously affected. The Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan closed her recording studio for the day, and six Cuban members of the Florida Marlins baseball team announced they would not play last night, but no leading non-Cuban figures offered any gesture of support. A nationwide poll found that a majority, 57%, of Americans supported the government's police action - a slight increase over the past two days. Meanwhile Elian, his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and their immediate family were moved from their temporary home at Andrews air force base outside Washington to Carmichael farm at the Wye River plantation in Maryland, where the late King Hussein stayed during recent Middle East talks. Mr Gonzalez asked the state department yesterday to grant visas for some of Elian's classmates and parents so that they could join him in the US and provide some degree of normality while the family waits for a court hearing on the boy's fate, due to start on May 11. The state department spokesman, James Rubin, said that once the visa applications arrived at the US interests section in Havana, they would be processed within 24 hours. Meanwhile, in Congress, the attorney general, Janet Reno, appeared before a bipartisan group of senators to account for her decision to send armed federal agents into the home of Elian's Miami relatives to seize the six-year-old boy. The Miami relatives, Cuban-American political groups and their Republican allies have accused Ms Reno of using excessive force at a time when negotiations were still under way. The attorney general argued that on the night, the Miami relatives continually played for time and showed no signs of being ready to hand over Elian. But Republicans repeated their call for a congressional investigation. \"I'm going to recommend to the majority leader that the Senate engage in a hearing or a set of hearings into the use of force,\" the Florida senator, Connie Mack, said, declaring himself \"horrified\" by the raid. But Democratic senators argued that the public appeared to be tired of the issue. Vermont senator Patrick Leahy said the Miami relatives' intention to damage the Cuban communist regime had backfired. \"They helped Castro and they hurt Elian,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>The Tory candidate for London mayor Steve Norris believes the core of the Conservative Party is racist, sexist and homophobic, according to a secretly taped conversation. He also feels increasingly detached from the party's \"rather unpleasant core\".</p> <p>The allegations, relayed by Mr Norris's most senior aide, come just over a week before polling day in both the London and local elections.</p> <p>The remarks will infuriate Conservative central office with which Mr Norris has had an uneasy relationship throughout the campaign, and will reignite the political debate inside the the party over its handling of the asylum issue.</p> <p>Mr Norris' views came from campaign aide Ceri Evans. In a conversation with a London-based Asian television company Zee TV, Mr Evans said: \"His credentials on equality, the sexual agenda and race and everything are utterly impeccable. Not only are they utterly impeccable, they cost him dear amongst the rather unpleasant core of the party from which we feel increasingly detached.\"</p> <p>Mr Evans was defending Mr Norris' refusal to join the other candidates in making a special broadcast for the company.</p> <p>Mr Evans who used to work for Tory leader William Hague at central office has been Mr Norris's right-hand man since last summer.</p> <p>Asked if he had indeed reflected Mr Norris's views on his party in this way, Mr Evans said: \"I am not going to nickel and dime you on my form of words. I might well have said there is a core of the party from which he is increasingly detached. I might well have said it. Frankly, if I had a memory erasion and you asked me again now, I would say the same thing.\"</p> <p>Mr Evans then adjusted his remarks to claim that Mr Norris only thought his agenda would distance himself from parts of the far right, or the periphery in his party.</p> <p>He continued: \"There are elements in all parts of the country, not just in London, who are not perhaps as tolerant as one might like.\"</p> <p>He said Norris \"does not just want people to tolerate diversity, he wanted them to celebrate the diversity of London. That does not happen the whole time\".</p> <p>Mr Norris was initially blocked from standing as the Conservative candidate by the 22-strong London executive on the grounds that he was a philanderer.

      "bodyText": "The Tory candidate for London mayor Steve Norris believes the core of the Conservative Party is racist, sexist and homophobic, according to a secretly taped conversation. He also feels increasingly detached from the party's \"rather unpleasant core\". The allegations, relayed by Mr Norris's most senior aide, come just over a week before polling day in both the London and local elections. The remarks will infuriate Conservative central office with which Mr Norris has had an uneasy relationship throughout the campaign, and will reignite the political debate inside the the party over its handling of the asylum issue. Mr Norris' views came from campaign aide Ceri Evans. In a conversation with a London-based Asian television company Zee TV, Mr Evans said: \"His credentials on equality, the sexual agenda and race and everything are utterly impeccable. Not only are they utterly impeccable, they cost him dear amongst the rather unpleasant core of the party from which we feel increasingly detached.\" Mr Evans was defending Mr Norris' refusal to join the other candidates in making a special broadcast for the company. Mr Evans who used to work for Tory leader William Hague at central office has been Mr Norris's right-hand man since last summer. Asked if he had indeed reflected Mr Norris's views on his party in this way, Mr Evans said: \"I am not going to nickel and dime you on my form of words. I might well have said there is a core of the party from which he is increasingly detached. I might well have said it. Frankly, if I had a memory erasion and you asked me again now, I would say the same thing.\" Mr Evans then adjusted his remarks to claim that Mr Norris only thought his agenda would distance himself from parts of the far right, or the periphery in his party. He continued: \"There are elements in all parts of the country, not just in London, who are not perhaps as tolerant as one might like.\" He said Norris \"does not just want people to tolerate diversity, he wanted them to celebrate the diversity of London. That does not happen the whole time\". Mr Norris was initially blocked from standing as the Conservative candidate by the 22-strong London executive on the grounds that he was a philanderer. The decision was overturned in December on the orders of Mr Hague, who had already lost his favoured candidate, the now disgraced Jeffrey Archer. Mr Norris credentials on gender equality are publicly known. At the outset of the campaign, he opposed the party's call to keep Section 28 saying that the controversial clause in the Local Government Act fosters widespread homophobic bullying in schools. He took a highly liberal view on race, opposing marriage bonds and the proposal from Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, to restrict immigration. Mr Norris attacked as immoral and disgusting plans by Ms Widdecombe to bring back the primary purpose rule, the rule aimed at stopping immigration for marriage from the Indian subcontinent. The measure is designed to debar applicants if immigration officials believe the marriage is designed purely to get foreign nationals into Britain. But Mr Norris subsequently disappointed the liberal wing of his party when he was reluctant to criticise Mr Hague's call for detention centres for all asylum seekers in Britain. He has also disappointed liberals by refusing to change his hard line stance on abortion. The embarrassing disclosure came as Frank Dobson, the Labour candidate, rounded on Mr Norris at the launch of his manifesto for London mayor. Mr Dobson said that it would be a great mistake to vote for Mr Norris because he would privatise the tube. \"The Tories devastated the capital in their 18 years in power with crime escalating, unemployment soaring and public transport neglected,\" Mr Dobson said. \"Let's not give them another chance to wreck London.\" His attack shows how Labour has been jolted by Mr Norris's success in reaching out to non-Tory voters. In the most recent opinion poll, Mr Norris nudged ahead of Mr Dobson after 16% of electors said they would vote for him. Labour has privately given up on a Dobson victory. Presuming a victory for the independent candidate, Ken Livingstone, Labour is embarking on a final round of frantic campaigning to avoid the humiliation of being beaten into second place by Mr Norris.",

The government said it had released 100,000 tonnes of wheat and rice each for Rajasthan and Gujarat which would be distributed in the drought-hit areas at subsidised prices, and Mr Vajpayee told parliament that trainloads of animal fodder were being rushed there. Meanwhile his Bharatiya Janata party urged rival groups not to play politics with drought. \"We appeal to all political parties to join in this endeavour and not politicise it, otherwise it would divert the nation's attention from the problem confronting the people,\" a BJP spokesman said.

      "bodyText": "The Colombian government has agreed to pull troops and police out of a northern region to enable peace talks with the country's second largest leftwing rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN. In a communique released on Monday, the ELN commander Nicolas Rodriguez said that government security forces would withdraw from the area surrounding three towns on the Magdalena river, to allow a national peace convention. \"Civil authorities, the guerrilla forces of the ELN and the communities will live side by side ...This is a serious attempt to find a peaceful solution to the conflict,\" he said. The president, Andres Pastrana, confirmed that the two sides had reached a \"general framework of understanding\", although he gave no details about the withdrawal. The announcement comes 17 months after government forces pulled out of a larger region in southern Colombia as a condition for talks with the most powerful rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). Since taking office in 1998, Mr Pastrana has concentrated on making peace with the 15,000-strong Farc, but talks have stalled and the group has refused to call a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the 5,000-strong ELN has carried out a campaign of terrorism and economic sabotage in an attempt to force the government to the negotiating table. Last year, ELN gunmen hijacked a domestic airliner, and abducted more than 100 worshippers from a church mass. The group declared a week-long Easter truce to coincide with behind-the-scenes talks with the government, but while most Colombians welcomed a new peace process, few believe it will be simple. Although the second demilitarised zone - about the size of Switzerland - will be much smaller than the territory ceded to the Farc, the region is a key economic and strategic corridor. Rich in oil, gold, and coca - the raw material for cocaine - the area straddles the Magdalena river, Colombia's main waterway, and road links to the Caribbean. Once an ELN stronghold, the region has been convulsed with violence since incursions by rightwing paramilitaries. In a letter to the government peace commissioner, Victor Ricardo, paramilitary commanders from the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia, or AUC, rejected the planned withdrawal, and threatened to attack the ELN within their safe haven. \"You cannot return to the ELN territory which the AUC has recovered,\" it said. \"The ELN must not use their demilitarised zone to launch terrorist attacks. If they do, we will not respect their refuge.\" But Mr Rodriguez announced that Colombian and international monitoring groups will be allowed into the ELN's demilitarised zone. Talks with Farc were suspended for several months last year, when commanders rejected the president's demand to allow international observers into their territory in the Caguan region of southern Colombia.",

Let's give the government a puzzle.\" The organisation has previously demanded that the US should free three Islamists, including Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was convicted of conspiring to blow up New York city landmarks. Sabah state police, in Malaysia, yesterday interrogated five people understood to include former employees of the Sipadan island resort, who were suspected of knowing some of the gunmen or aiding them in the kidnapping. Earlier yesterday, a local Philippine radio station broadcast an appeal from a Catholic priest, held captive on Basilan by Abu Sayyaf along with the children, pleading for the military offensive to stop.",

      "bodyText": "A wave of political repression continued to engulf Zimbabwe yesterday following the murder of three supporters of the opposition party, allegedly at the hands of activists from the ruling party. The killings mark a sharp escalation in political violence over the last few days as members of Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party switched the emphasis of their campaign of political intimidation away from white farmers to individual supporters of the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), ahead of next month's elections. One MDC supporter was attacked with axes in Shamva, 55 miles north of Harare, on Monday night after attending a rally. He was approached by Zanu supporters and asked to produce the party card. \"He failed to do so and was beaten badly,\" said Moses Kufandiko, the MDC organising secretary for the area. David Mhaurwa died yesterday morning. Another MDC supporter was killed on Monday night in the capital, Harare. He was working as a bouncer at a bar when two Zanu supporters approached and asked to come in. He refused them entry and when they noticed that he was wearing an MDC T-shirt they beat him to death with metal bars. Another opposition organiser, Robert Mbuzi, died from gunshot wounds he suffered on Friday near Mhangura, 100 miles north-west of Harare. Their murders bring the death toll to 12 in the past two months. Ten of the victims have been members of the MDC, which is posing a serious threat to the 20-year rule of president Robert Mugabe's party. The other two were a farm foreman and a policeman who was killed because he was suspected of supporting the MDC. Two of the dead MDC members were also white farmers. Police arrested five suspects for the murders yesterday - the first arrests since the most recent spate of killings and beatings began. Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the MDC, said political violence may be the price Zimbabwe has to pay to achieve democratic change. \"This intimidation will continue,\" he said. \"We believe violence against our supporters will not be scaled down until after the elections, whenever they are held. The MDC is aware of this burden and sacrifice. It will not deter our campaign. The elections are the real benchmark. They will determine where this country is headed. We shall pull through.\" Mr Tsvangirai doubted whether a meeting in London later this week, between a Zimbabwe government delegation and the British government to discuss the land crisis, would offer a tangible solution. \"We believe the question is one of the future of Mugabe's government, and that cannot be settled by the London meeting. The violence at home has nothing to do with commercial farmers, it is a political equation,\" Mr Tsvangirai said. With the scheduled time for the election fast approaching and the MDC maintaining a strong political presence, Mr Mugabe has stopped scapegoating white farmers and let the question of land reform take a back seat as his party's supporters have begun to target opposition party workers and the black labourers he fears will support them. Many white farmers returned to their homes over the Easter weekend under local deals with squatters which ensured their safety, so long as they did not allow the MDC to organise on their property. Mr Mugabe's political opponents have accused him of attempting to stoke up racial hatred and revive the issue of land redistribution in order to divert the electorate's attention from the parlous state of the country and the unpopular war in the Congo.

      "body": "<p>Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Ogoni activist whose execution in 1995 brought opprobrium on the oil multinational Shell, received a symbolic funeral on Monday. But his body remains where it was buried by the Nigerian regime. </p> <p>In a move which typifies the confusion and infighting of this Niger delta region, this week' s funeral, which was organised by his younger brother did not include a reburial. That is still planned for the November anniversary of the execution, with other members of the family insisting on honouring his wishes for a private ceremony. </p> <p>For the past two years Shell has been attempting to repair relations with the Ogoni. With the Methodist church acting as intermediary, a painfully slow reconciliation appeared to be healing the wounds caused by the company's refusal to intervene in the events that led to the execution of Saro-Wiwa and eight colleagues. </p> <p>That has all fallen apart over the past few weeks, however. Violence has erupted again, resulting in several deaths. Ledum Mitee, Saro-Wiwa's successor as leader of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop), has been charged with attempted murder and arson. He is due to appear in court next week on the arson charges, ironically the day after Shell publishes its third annual report on its social and environmental performance. </p> <p>The latest conflict endangers Shell's efforts to be seen as a \"responsible\" business. It also highlights the difficulties for companies attempting to work in accordance with the wishes of the communities where they operate. </p> <p>The Ogoni affair in 1995, combined with the humiliating climbdown over plans to sink the Brent Spar oil platform, forced Shell to reassess its business approach and pursue what it dubbed \"profits with principles\". This includes opening its social and environmental performance to external scrutiny. </p> <p>But despite years of careful diplomacy in Nigeria, Shell is accused once again of trampling local communities and bypassing Ogoni representatives. In an open letter to Shell chairman Mark Moody-Stuart, Mr Mitee wrote: \"Shell risks sparking the worst crisis in relations since1995.\" </p> <p>Mosop describes the recent violence as a rerun of 1994 - the events which led to the arrest and execution of the Mosop activists. </p> <p>Speaking from his law chambers in Port Harcourt before his arrest, Mr Mitee said: \"Shell has not actually changed over the past five years.

      "bodyText": "Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Ogoni activist whose execution in 1995 brought opprobrium on the oil multinational Shell, received a symbolic funeral on Monday. But his body remains where it was buried by the Nigerian regime. In a move which typifies the confusion and infighting of this Niger delta region, this week' s funeral, which was organised by his younger brother did not include a reburial. That is still planned for the November anniversary of the execution, with other members of the family insisting on honouring his wishes for a private ceremony. For the past two years Shell has been attempting to repair relations with the Ogoni. With the Methodist church acting as intermediary, a painfully slow reconciliation appeared to be healing the wounds caused by the company's refusal to intervene in the events that led to the execution of Saro-Wiwa and eight colleagues. That has all fallen apart over the past few weeks, however. Violence has erupted again, resulting in several deaths. Ledum Mitee, Saro-Wiwa's successor as leader of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop), has been charged with attempted murder and arson. He is due to appear in court next week on the arson charges, ironically the day after Shell publishes its third annual report on its social and environmental performance. The latest conflict endangers Shell's efforts to be seen as a \"responsible\" business. It also highlights the difficulties for companies attempting to work in accordance with the wishes of the communities where they operate. The Ogoni affair in 1995, combined with the humiliating climbdown over plans to sink the Brent Spar oil platform, forced Shell to reassess its business approach and pursue what it dubbed \"profits with principles\". This includes opening its social and environmental performance to external scrutiny. But despite years of careful diplomacy in Nigeria, Shell is accused once again of trampling local communities and bypassing Ogoni representatives. In an open letter to Shell chairman Mark Moody-Stuart, Mr Mitee wrote: \"Shell risks sparking the worst crisis in relations since1995.\" Mosop describes the recent violence as a rerun of 1994 - the events which led to the arrest and execution of the Mosop activists. Speaking from his law chambers in Port Harcourt before his arrest, Mr Mitee said: \"Shell has not actually changed over the past five years. There is nothing to show they want to match words to actions on the ground.\" Mosop accuses the oil company of using sham consultations with local organisations in the Ogoni region to justify pushing ahead with road construction projects. It says local government leaders have been bribed to allow contractors into the area but local opposition has necessitated armed police protection. And the organisation claims documents supposedly showing Mr Mitee's support for the road projects are forgeries. Rebuttal Shell dismisses these accusations. Emeka Achebe, an adviser on Nigeria in the group's London headquarters, said the company has asked for evidence of bribery, which would justify instant dismissal, but none has been forthcoming. He says Shell is not interested in working under armed protection. \"We are committed to not working in areas where we are not welcome,\" Mr Achebe said. \"The best security is good relationships.

He confirmed that Shell would eventually hope to start producing oil again in the area, but said the immediate aim was to repair relationships and rebuild communities. This approach is based on the group's new philosophy, developed after the Saro-Wiwa affair, which places social and environmental objectives alongside shareholder value. \"There are three legs to our philosophy.

      "body": "<p>It has entered into City folklore - and with some justification, it seems. It is also one of the first initiation regimes for fresh-faced City traders, to chant the rhyme: \"Sell in May and go away. Buy again on St Leger's day.\" </p> <p>For most, working out when St Leger's day falls is the biggest problem, and for the record, it is a key day in the racing calendar and falls on the first or second Saturday in September. </p> <p>But the next question is what is the point in learning such a childish mantra in the first place? According to research by Standard Life Investments there is every reason to remember the silly sounding rhyme. </p> <p>By analysing equity prices over the past 27 years Standard Life concluded that equity markets appear to prefer the winter months. </p> <p>The research showed that between 1973 and last year, stock prices around the world made their sharpest gains in December, January and April, and fell every month between - and including - May to September. </p> <p>Just to be sure, the Standard Life fund managers broke down each period between equities markets in the US, Britain and Japan and also found consistency. They also split the 27-year period into three blocks - the 70s, 80s and 90s - and established that consistency remained, albeit with a slight weakening over the time. </p> <p>Standard Life concludes that the established trend may be weakening because of changes in saving patterns among investors, who now put their money into the market on a monthly basis through savings schemes instead of waiting for year-end tax incentives before blitzing the market. </p> <p>The research also makes the point that the reason prices rise so much at the start of the year might also be because companies, which sell stock to raise new money, tend to be less active in the early part of the year. This reduces supply when demand is going up, hence the simple demand and supply equation is in force. Standard Life notes that even though the mantra works over time, the market appears to have ignored it this year. </p> <p>This might because the markets were so strong at the end of last year or, more worryingly, because they are about to to undergo a serious period of weakness. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the fund managers conclude that the application of the mantra to this year's movements suggests the markets are on course for unseasonal summer strength.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has entered into City folklore - and with some justification, it seems. It is also one of the first initiation regimes for fresh-faced City traders, to chant the rhyme: \"Sell in May and go away. Buy again on St Leger's day.\" For most, working out when St Leger's day falls is the biggest problem, and for the record, it is a key day in the racing calendar and falls on the first or second Saturday in September. But the next question is what is the point in learning such a childish mantra in the first place? According to research by Standard Life Investments there is every reason to remember the silly sounding rhyme. By analysing equity prices over the past 27 years Standard Life concluded that equity markets appear to prefer the winter months. The research showed that between 1973 and last year, stock prices around the world made their sharpest gains in December, January and April, and fell every month between - and including - May to September. Just to be sure, the Standard Life fund managers broke down each period between equities markets in the US, Britain and Japan and also found consistency. They also split the 27-year period into three blocks - the 70s, 80s and 90s - and established that consistency remained, albeit with a slight weakening over the time. Standard Life concludes that the established trend may be weakening because of changes in saving patterns among investors, who now put their money into the market on a monthly basis through savings schemes instead of waiting for year-end tax incentives before blitzing the market. The research also makes the point that the reason prices rise so much at the start of the year might also be because companies, which sell stock to raise new money, tend to be less active in the early part of the year. This reduces supply when demand is going up, hence the simple demand and supply equation is in force. Standard Life notes that even though the mantra works over time, the market appears to have ignored it this year. This might because the markets were so strong at the end of last year or, more worryingly, because they are about to to undergo a serious period of weakness. Unsurprisingly, the fund managers conclude that the application of the mantra to this year's movements suggests the markets are on course for unseasonal summer strength.",

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based think tank which represents the worlds richest countries, is pressing ahead with plans to publish a list of jurisdictions which meet the technical criteria of harmful tax practices in June. However, Frances Horner, head of the organisation's tax competition unit, said yesterday that the list would not form the basis of any sanctions to be applied. Instead, the OECD would take another year to refine the list, excluding those jurisdictions which have agreed to cooperate with the OECD by opening their books to inspectors seeking to track down tax fraudsters.

The OECD has identified 47 jurisdictions which it suspects of harmful tax practices, including Caribbean states and British territories, such as the Cayman Islands, Jersey and the Bahamas, and has been in negotiations with them for some time but is it also aiming to eradicate bad practice in member states. Earlier this month, the organisation achieved a breakthrough when Switzerland and Luxembourg both agreed to sign a report committing OECD members to end the use of banking secrecy laws to hide fiscal crime. The failure of the two countries to cooperate in the past represented a significant moral flaw in the OECD's argument with offshore centres, which had accused it of hypocrisy.

The candidates of what we still, rather quaintly, call the \"three main parties\" are slugging it out for second place. The Green has already conceded defeat.</p> <p>Ken's lead is so great, his stroll toward the London mayoralty such a cakewalk, that he has barely broken a sweat. His campaign has been meagre, saying little, doing little. Such is the prerogative of a candidate with a massive lead - his prime objective is to sit on it. When he has made news, it's usually been with an ill-chosen remark: he appeared to play down Hitler's crimes when he wanted to play up the cruelty of world debt. But these have been mere blips.</p> <p>Instead, the campaign has become a victory march. The real battle, we now realise, was the internal contest for the Labour nomination: the action has dried up since then. In its place has come Red Ken's morphing from a politician into something larger. Behold, Ken Livingstone - cultural icon.</p> <p>His face is deemed fashionable enough to wear: either as a Che Guevara-style portrait on a limited-edition T-shirt or multiply reproduced over a suit, as worn by Harry Enfield at the premiere last week of his new film. Like Gary Lineker before him, Livingstone even has his very own London play: Snogging Ken, complete with Warhol-style headshot on the programme cover. The play, a skit really, by Tariq Ali, Howard Brenton and Andy de la Tour, takes as its premise the sheer inevitability of the independent candidate. \"What do the focus groups say?\" asks Lola, an ultra-Blairite MP. \"We dissolved them,\" replies the evil Pandora of Millbank. \"They all wanted to vote for Ken.\"</p> <p>The man is fast becoming a phenomenon. Very few politicians break out of politics and penetrate popular culture: Margaret Thatcher managed it (inspiring the now-forgotten song Stand Down, Margaret) so, for different reasons, did Richard Nixon (played by Antony Hopkins in the movie). But it's been a long time since a figure from British local government won a similar accolade.</p> <p>Still, besides elevating Ken into the stratosphere of national celebrity, what has this mayor's race - now all but over - achieved? After consuming so much of the public oxygen for six months, has any good come of it?</p> <p>The answer is an enthusiastic yes. The conventional wisdom may rule that the London contest has been a farce, a pantomime starring Ken, Frank (and earlier Jeffrey) which has given politics a bad name.

But, in his first interview since being acquitted of theft, the head of Greenpeace says even Eton couldn't prepare him for his time in prison.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Lord Melchett, executive director of Greenpeace, alumnus of Eton, Cambridge and the Callaghan government, was due to fly to Tanzania for a scuba diving holiday last July. The cases were packed and his family was waiting, but Melchett didn't show: he was banged up in a cell in Norwich Prison, hoping for clemency from the duty magistrate. Frazer Morrison, however, did not consider the peer's wish to see the marine life of the Indian Ocean sufficient cause for granting bail and kept Lord Melchett in for two nights and three days, an experience, he says, that not even public school had prepared him for. </p> <p>Nine months later, Lord Peter Melchett is in his house in Kentish Town, freshly acquitted of theft and awaiting the verdict on whether he and 27 other Greenpeace activists will be retried for criminal damage. It was on a Monday morning last July that they wheeled a big mower into a field of GM maize near Norwich and tried to cut it down before it could pollinate neighbouring crops. It wasn't an act of vandalism, he says, but a genuine attempt to clear the field of pollution that would have worked, godammit, if they'd had an undisturbed hour and a half with the mower. \"Greenpeace doesn't have a moral objection to GM foods. We don't believe it is something that religion wouldn't countenance, or that it's an interference with nature to which people would have ethical objection. We just think there is a danger in introducing something into the environment that you can't recall.\" </p> <p>If Melchett is an unlikely eco-warrior, it is not for his poshness, but for his ambiguous relationship with the establishment. He looks like a hush puppy, with squashed features, luxurious hair and a way of bobbing up and down under the force of his own jollity. He is the fourth baron of a title created in 1928 by his great grandfather. \"On paper, I suppose I look like a very establishment figure. But it wasn't quite like that. My family were German Jewish immigrants who possibly wouldn't have got into the country today. My great grandfather started ICI and was a Liberal politician. They were nouveau riche, I suppose. My mother never voted conservative. My father ran the steel industry under Harold Wilson and was seen as a traitor to conservative values. They weren't seen by the upper class to be particularly conventional.\" </p> <p>Melchett was none the less sent to Eton, where he interpreted his masters' advice to engage in the national debate by going to hear Barbara Castle address a meeting in Slough. \"It wasn't quite what they had in mind. But I thought she was brilliant.\" There followed a conventional path through Cambridge and the Lords, with occasional flashes of rebellion that would culminate in him leaving politics to take up the job at Greenpeace in 1979. Melchett chose to do an MA in criminology at Keele University, a discipline that the Cambridge law faculty thought of as intellectual heresy and could scarcely bare to speak of. (Melchett was given such unconventional assignments as being sent on the beat with Stoke-on-Trent police and, more usefully for his future career, observing prisoners at Grendon Underwood.) </p> <p>There was a seminal moment with some dead partridges on the family farm in Norfolk. It has become more seminal in the retelling, says Melchett, but it was a profound boyhood experience: stumbling across two dead chicks that had been starved by the effects of pesticides. Having been brought up to applaud science, Melchett began for the first time to question it. \"My father ran a big farming company in Norfolk, and cared a lot about the countryside. It never occurred to him that these modern, scientific sprays that he was using might be killing things he cared about. The idea that science proceeds in this rational, orderly way is bullshit. People have political and personal and financial agendas that they pursue with a level of viciousness.\" </p> <p>Melchett worked in the environment ministry, the department of industry and was a minister of state in the Northern Ireland Office. In 1975 he acted on a working party on pop festivals. Then, when the Labour government lost to the Conservatives in 1979, he left. \"It didn't appeal to me as a long-term career. The House of Lords is an appalling institution; it's really not something to base your life on. I find it embarrassing explaining to people from other countries how the House of Lords works.\" </p> <p>His dislike of the Lords is such that Melchett has purposefully not married his partner and the mother of his son, to stop his title being passed down to the next generation. Disapproving of the hereditary peerage and taking to an airforce base perimeter fence with a pair of bolt cutters is quite a leap, but Melchett is laconic about his defection from lawmaker to lawbreaker, wrapping it up in terms of personal necessity. When he got involved in the anti-nuclear debate, the Chernobyl disaster had just happened and Melchett envis aged the 200-year-old beech trees of his native Norfolk as cinders on a charred landscape. He thought he'd be of more use to the environment outside of the political establishment, while using his experience within it. \"There's an element of knowing how the other side behaves. It's like that dialogue in Yes Minister: 'Well, Sir Humphry, what happens if we get an independent scientific advisor and he says the wrong thing?' And Sir Humphry says, 'Don't worry minister, he's one of us.' And that's how it works.\" </p> <p>Melchett doesn't shy away from confrontation, but he does prefer the behind-the-scenes wranglings that don't come with the threat of a prison sentence. One gets the feeling he enjoys revisiting his ministerial days by mixing and debating with politicians. One of his greatest triumphs, he says, was persuading Tim Yeo, then a junior minister at the department of environment, to install ozone-friendly fridges in his department's kitchens. \"There was outrage in the refrigeration business because the government couldn't buy them in Britain and had to turn to Germany. It was a great moment.\" </p> <p>Great moments, for Melchett, are not the demos and theatrical sit-ins, but those in which he successfully negotiates with a government to change its environment policy. \"I don't think groups like Greenpeace should have the power to make decisions; of course we shouldn't, we shouldn't have the power to decide if GM crops are on the market. Ultimately, a democratically elected government must decide that, but they need the pressure.\" </p> <p>Pressure is most effective when it comes from a variety of sources and it is variety that Melchett loves: the 27 activists in court with him included a Baptist minister, a beautician from Yorkshire, a biochemist from Cardiff University, a BBC researcher, a forester and a social worker. Even when he went to prison, an experience he found awful, he received a lot of support from fellow inmates. \"When I went to get my food the first time, the prisoner dishing it out said, you can't eat this, it's not guaranteed GM free. I had a lot of encouragement to go on hunger strike.\" To Melchett, there could have been no higher compliment.</p>",

It was given a mark of 64%, with only three other tunnels achieving a lower score.</p> <p>The survey was commissioned by European motoring organisations, including the AA, following the fire in the Mont Blanc tunnel which killed 33 people in March 1999. But investigators from a German firm of consultants were refused access to four Italian tunnels and to the Dartford tunnel, the busiest in Europe, which carries 150,000 vehicles under the Thames.</p> <p>The Queensway tunnel between Liverpool and the Wirral was rated acceptable and the adjacent, newer Kingsway tunnel described as good.</p> <p>But the consultants criticised all three British tunnels for failing to have automatic fire detectors, raised walkways accessible to all and emergency, sound-proofed phones.

      "bodyText": "The mile-long tunnel which carries 32,000 vehicles a day under the river Tyne has been rated poor in a survey of safety standards of 25 tunnels in Europe published today. It was given a mark of 64%, with only three other tunnels achieving a lower score. The survey was commissioned by European motoring organisations, including the AA, following the fire in the Mont Blanc tunnel which killed 33 people in March 1999. But investigators from a German firm of consultants were refused access to four Italian tunnels and to the Dartford tunnel, the busiest in Europe, which carries 150,000 vehicles under the Thames. The Queensway tunnel between Liverpool and the Wirral was rated acceptable and the adjacent, newer Kingsway tunnel described as good. But the consultants criticised all three British tunnels for failing to have automatic fire detectors, raised walkways accessible to all and emergency, sound-proofed phones. Potential problems with the smoke extraction systems in the Tyne and Queensway tunnels were also criticised. However, they praised the three British operators for having procedures to deal with emergencies and hazardous loads. They also praised fire services and systems for dealing with broken down vehicles. No tunnel in Europe scored 90% or more, which would have earned a \"very good\" rating. Eight were rated as good, nine as acceptable and six as poor.

      "body": "<p>Peace talks between Israel and Palestinian leaders resume this week, under the aegis of the US, with a formal commitment by all to come to a \"final agreement\" before the autumn and the end of Bill Clinton's mandate as president. Negotiations focus on air and sea ports, safe passage routes between Gaza and the West Bank - and the existence of a Palestinian state as a kind of Bantustan.</p> <p>But the issue that was at the core of the \"peace process\" begun in Oslo will again be avoided. It is the 5m refugees whose right to return to their homes in Palestine and to be compensated for loss and property damage was recognised by UN resolution 194 of December 1948. This resolution has been reaffirmed more than 100 times but never implemented. In 1994, for the first time, the US voted against it in the general assembly - a warning that the UN is no longer a reference point for Washington.</p> <p>Even third and fourth generation Palestinians maintain a strong identification with their original homes. They keep the keys to their houses and small children can describe in detail the family villages they and even their parents have never seen. The conditions in which most of them live should be an international scandal, but it suits the parties to the peace process to forget.</p> <p>Lebanon has the worst record. The massacres by the Israelis and their Lebanese allies at the Sabra and Chatilla camps in 1982 are a wound that has never healed. The Lebanese political environment is hostile. All Beirut governments since 1948 have refused to grant Palestinians citizenship or integrate them into the local economy. State policy restricts Palestinians' housing, jobs and travel - aiming to encourage the emigration of these mainly Sunni Muslims who could upset Lebanon's tenuous sectarian balance. Some 75,000 Palestinians have in fact left in the last 10 years. In the camps 60% live below the poverty line, and there is 40% unemployment. Funding for the refugees has dwindled in recent years, leaving a gap UN officials call a \"collective disaster\".</p> <p>Uniquely, Palestinian refugees do not come under the protection of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, but have their own organisation, the UN Relief and Works Agency, in recognition of the fact that their problem was created by the UN itself with the attempted division of Palestine. In 1947 the UN proposed giving 56% of the territory of Palestine to a Jewish state and went ahead with the plan despite its rejection by the Palestinian leadership and some Zionist parties.</p> <p>In 1948, 1967 and 1982 waves of ethnic cleansing virtually destroyed Palestinian society. Palestinians' profound sense of dispossession, and the discrimination against them where they now live, has made them a serious destabilising factor in the Middle East. With 70% of Palestinians being refugees, the issue cannot be kept off the agenda if the peace process, which began with the Madrid conference of 1991, is to have any chance of succeeding.</p> <p>The refugee issue was obfuscated by Oslo. Those pushed out in 1948 when the state of Israel was created are excluded; only refugees from the 1967 war are to be considered. After Oslo the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leadership began cautiously to say the unthinkable, suggesting that the right of return was no longer practical, although the PLO's public position continued to ask for the right to return under resolution 194. In the refugee camps and among diaspora intellectuals, such as Edward Said, the shift was seen as a betrayal by PLO leaders. This has brought refugees to the centre of the growing revolt against the peace process. The Israelis say international aid should be used to settle the refugees in their host communities or elsewhere in the Arab world.</p> <p>When Israel was established in 1948 Jews controlled 7-8% of the land and the British an additional 6-7%. Today the situation is reversed with 93% of the land held by Israeli Jews. The land was seized from Palestinian refugees now living outside Israel and from the 230,000 Palestinian Israeli citizens still inside.</p> <p>Is it unrealistic, as the Israelis say, to imagine the refugees returning? Meticulous records of much of the 1948 land ownership were made by British land expert Frank Jarvis for the UN Palestine Conciliation Commission using data from the mandate records. Research done since by Dr Salman Abu Sitta shows the concentration of Jews today is largely in and around pre-1948 Jewish land and that Palestinian land is mainly empty. Dr Abu Sitta's proposes the return of refugees in the worst circumstances, from Lebanon and Gaza. Lebanon refugees could mostly return to their homes in Galilee, making little impact on the Jewish community. Gaza refugees could return to almost empty land in the southern part of Israel.</p> <p>The US supports the return of stolen property to its rightful owners by backing the efforts of the Jewish restitution organisation. In Germany the first agreement between the government and Jewish organisations was in 1952 and $60bn was paid in compensation. German industry last year came under pressure from President Clinton and paid between $1bn and $2bn recompense for the suffering of Jewish slave workers under the Nazis. Hungary, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Poland and France have all passed or drafted laws for the restitution of Jewish property. Swiss banks, under pressure from the US, have paid back enormous sums to Jewish Holocaust survivors and their families.</p> <p>No comparable pressure group exists to press for Palestinians, although there are stirrings among the diaspora and estimates of Palestinians' losses and compensation due have been made. Academics calculate material losses as between $147bn and $253bn. Another estimate includes non- material losses and amounts to $114,000 for each of 5m refugees.</p> <p>Victoria Brittain is the Guardian's deputy foreign editor. <br><a href=\"mailto:victoria.brittain@theguardian.com\">mailto:victoria.brittain@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Peace talks between Israel and Palestinian leaders resume this week, under the aegis of the US, with a formal commitment by all to come to a \"final agreement\" before the autumn and the end of Bill Clinton's mandate as president. Negotiations focus on air and sea ports, safe passage routes between Gaza and the West Bank - and the existence of a Palestinian state as a kind of Bantustan. But the issue that was at the core of the \"peace process\" begun in Oslo will again be avoided. It is the 5m refugees whose right to return to their homes in Palestine and to be compensated for loss and property damage was recognised by UN resolution 194 of December 1948. This resolution has been reaffirmed more than 100 times but never implemented. In 1994, for the first time, the US voted against it in the general assembly - a warning that the UN is no longer a reference point for Washington. Even third and fourth generation Palestinians maintain a strong identification with their original homes. They keep the keys to their houses and small children can describe in detail the family villages they and even their parents have never seen. The conditions in which most of them live should be an international scandal, but it suits the parties to the peace process to forget. Lebanon has the worst record. The massacres by the Israelis and their Lebanese allies at the Sabra and Chatilla camps in 1982 are a wound that has never healed. The Lebanese political environment is hostile. All Beirut governments since 1948 have refused to grant Palestinians citizenship or integrate them into the local economy. State policy restricts Palestinians' housing, jobs and travel - aiming to encourage the emigration of these mainly Sunni Muslims who could upset Lebanon's tenuous sectarian balance. Some 75,000 Palestinians have in fact left in the last 10 years. In the camps 60% live below the poverty line, and there is 40% unemployment. Funding for the refugees has dwindled in recent years, leaving a gap UN officials call a \"collective disaster\". Uniquely, Palestinian refugees do not come under the protection of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, but have their own organisation, the UN Relief and Works Agency, in recognition of the fact that their problem was created by the UN itself with the attempted division of Palestine. In 1947 the UN proposed giving 56% of the territory of Palestine to a Jewish state and went ahead with the plan despite its rejection by the Palestinian leadership and some Zionist parties. In 1948, 1967 and 1982 waves of ethnic cleansing virtually destroyed Palestinian society. Palestinians' profound sense of dispossession, and the discrimination against them where they now live, has made them a serious destabilising factor in the Middle East. With 70% of Palestinians being refugees, the issue cannot be kept off the agenda if the peace process, which began with the Madrid conference of 1991, is to have any chance of succeeding. The refugee issue was obfuscated by Oslo. Those pushed out in 1948 when the state of Israel was created are excluded; only refugees from the 1967 war are to be considered. After Oslo the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leadership began cautiously to say the unthinkable, suggesting that the right of return was no longer practical, although the PLO's public position continued to ask for the right to return under resolution 194. In the refugee camps and among diaspora intellectuals, such as Edward Said, the shift was seen as a betrayal by PLO leaders. This has brought refugees to the centre of the growing revolt against the peace process. The Israelis say international aid should be used to settle the refugees in their host communities or elsewhere in the Arab world. When Israel was established in 1948 Jews controlled 7-8% of the land and the British an additional 6-7%. Today the situation is reversed with 93% of the land held by Israeli Jews. The land was seized from Palestinian refugees now living outside Israel and from the 230,000 Palestinian Israeli citizens still inside. Is it unrealistic, as the Israelis say, to imagine the refugees returning? Meticulous records of much of the 1948 land ownership were made by British land expert Frank Jarvis for the UN Palestine Conciliation Commission using data from the mandate records. Research done since by Dr Salman Abu Sitta shows the concentration of Jews today is largely in and around pre-1948 Jewish land and that Palestinian land is mainly empty. Dr Abu Sitta's proposes the return of refugees in the worst circumstances, from Lebanon and Gaza. Lebanon refugees could mostly return to their homes in Galilee, making little impact on the Jewish community. Gaza refugees could return to almost empty land in the southern part of Israel. The US supports the return of stolen property to its rightful owners by backing the efforts of the Jewish restitution organisation. In Germany the first agreement between the government and Jewish organisations was in 1952 and $60bn was paid in compensation. German industry last year came under pressure from President Clinton and paid between $1bn and $2bn recompense for the suffering of Jewish slave workers under the Nazis. Hungary, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Poland and France have all passed or drafted laws for the restitution of Jewish property. Swiss banks, under pressure from the US, have paid back enormous sums to Jewish Holocaust survivors and their families. No comparable pressure group exists to press for Palestinians, although there are stirrings among the diaspora and estimates of Palestinians' losses and compensation due have been made. Academics calculate material losses as between $147bn and $253bn. Another estimate includes non- material losses and amounts to $114,000 for each of 5m refugees.

Only when he had an answer to his simple question would it be possible, in his view, to move on to a discussion of the Woodcock pet project - the reform and restructuring of the entire trades union movement.</p> <p>Alas, he got no satisfactory response from such panjandrums of the card vote as Frank Cousins of the Transport Workers and Bill Carron of the engineers. Woodcock saw himself as up to the armpits in high-pressure discussions with successive Conservative and Labour governments over the running of the economy. What he got back from the men (and they were men) round the table was that their job was to fatten the pay packets of their members at every opportunity - and not much else.</p> <p>This extraordinary confrontation took place at a meeting of the economic committee of the TUC general council - the inner cabinet of the movement - in December 1962. The minutes of the meeting are reported in some detail in a timely new two-volume set of essays on the history of trades unionism in the post-war period up to the advent of Thatcherism*. The article on Woodcock and his failed crusade is written by Robert Taylor of the Financial Times, and it reveals just how far-sighted this difficult, and sometimes perverse, man really was.</p> <p>In the course of a lengthy introductory speech, Woodcock clearly foresaw the coming of Thatcherism, the return of mass unemployment and even, to some extent, the acceptance of the monetarist approach to the economy by New Labour.</p> <p>In a key passage, he told his colleagues: \"The free-for-all cannot continue unabated. It will bring regulation, either by legislation or by unemployment. If this problem is not solved, the government will solve it for us by putting employers back into the position of having to be tough.\"</p> <p>Alas, his analysis was not so much rejected as ignored. As Frank Cousins put it, if there is a free-for-all, then we must be part of the all. Woodcock never returned to the subject, though he soldiered on for another six years.

      "bodyText": "It is almost 40 years since the then general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, the Ruskin and Balliol-educated George Woodcock, posed a disarmingly simple and obvious question to his colleagues on the TUC general council. \"Why,\" he asked them, \"are we here?\" He wanted to know what these great and good leaders of something like 14m paid-up members - almost double the present, post-Thatcher figure - actually believed the trades union movement was all about. Only when he had an answer to his simple question would it be possible, in his view, to move on to a discussion of the Woodcock pet project - the reform and restructuring of the entire trades union movement. Alas, he got no satisfactory response from such panjandrums of the card vote as Frank Cousins of the Transport Workers and Bill Carron of the engineers. Woodcock saw himself as up to the armpits in high-pressure discussions with successive Conservative and Labour governments over the running of the economy. What he got back from the men (and they were men) round the table was that their job was to fatten the pay packets of their members at every opportunity - and not much else. This extraordinary confrontation took place at a meeting of the economic committee of the TUC general council - the inner cabinet of the movement - in December 1962. The minutes of the meeting are reported in some detail in a timely new two-volume set of essays on the history of trades unionism in the post-war period up to the advent of Thatcherism*. The article on Woodcock and his failed crusade is written by Robert Taylor of the Financial Times, and it reveals just how far-sighted this difficult, and sometimes perverse, man really was. In the course of a lengthy introductory speech, Woodcock clearly foresaw the coming of Thatcherism, the return of mass unemployment and even, to some extent, the acceptance of the monetarist approach to the economy by New Labour. In a key passage, he told his colleagues: \"The free-for-all cannot continue unabated. It will bring regulation, either by legislation or by unemployment. If this problem is not solved, the government will solve it for us by putting employers back into the position of having to be tough.\" Alas, his analysis was not so much rejected as ignored. As Frank Cousins put it, if there is a free-for-all, then we must be part of the all. Woodcock never returned to the subject, though he soldiered on for another six years. It was one of the great lost opportunities, leading remorselessly to the winter of discontent of 1978/9, the fall of the Callaghan government and the arrival of Mrs Thatcher and her \"ism\", and resulting ultimately in New Labour's endorsement of the concept of a flexible labour market. It all could - as Mr Taylor clearly believes - have been very different. But it did not happen, and the successors of Frank Cousins, Bill Carron, Hughie Scanlon and Jack Jones are now facing a situation in which vast swaths of the manufacturing industry on which they depend for their core membership is being destroyed. So the impending withdrawal of BMW and Ford from mass car production in Britain could prove to be a turning point for the unions, in which they are forced, finally, to acknowledge just how little power they possess to carry out their primary function as the defenders of their members' livelihoods. It is true that strike action has a certain muscular resonance, recalling the years of union militancy when shop stewards were the lords of creation and most managers cringed at the sight of a union card. But few people inside the present day union bureaucracy, and even fewer in the boardrooms of BMW and Ford, can take the idea of a strike seriously, as an effective means of saving jobs rather than a means of letting off steam. So the unions are effectively reduced to pleading with the government to do something - anything, they know not what - to prevent the remorseless process of cost-cutting at the expense of their members' livelihoods. But the government, beyond a few personal appeals from Mister Tony to the people he thought he had turned into his friends, is no better equipped with ideas for preventing the apparently inevitable. And ministers are well aware that their attachment to the flexible economy - a euphemism for making it easy to sack people - has helped to create the situation they now face. It is at this point that many union members must be beginning to think not just about the sort of questions that exercised George Woodcock, but also about the hitherto taboo subject of the relationship between the trades unions and the Labour party. For there is an obvious question which has hung over New Labour ever since its birth, and it is this: if we can't rely on the Labour government to protect our most vital interests - namely, the jobs of our members - why do we give them all that money? Ironically, it was New Labour itself which first raised the question of whether this long-standing alliance had any further justification. Indeed, Mr Blair himself made it clear some time before he became party leader that it would be possible to do without union cash if the party set out to build a mass membership. Such a project was feasible, he argued, because he had achieved just that in his own constituency of Sedgefield. So convinced was he that he called me in for a wigging when I expressed scepticism in these pages. Similar thoughts were expressed somewhat later by, as it happens, the very man the unions are now relying on in Dagenham and Longbridge: none other than Stephen Byers, the present industry secretary, was identified as the shadow minister who unwisely blurted out some \"dump the unions\" speculation to a couple of journalists in a Blackpool seafood restaurant. But harsh reality, in the form of falling rather than rising membership, has since broken through. It is now well understood that New Labour's increasingly expensive election campaigns cannot be funded entirely by people like Bernie Ecclestone. Trade union money is still crucial to \"the project\". But a \"project\" which includes high interest rates and a grossly over-valued pound is hardly one to appeal to union members who are suffering the consequences. So perhaps some of them will now revive George Woodcock's question, and I suspect that very few will reply: \"We are here to pay the Labour party's bills.\" Perhaps the time has come to ask for something back.

Patients are no longer prepared to feel disempowered by the lack of adequate information specific to their cases and the failure of personal interchanges and joint decision-making that would enable them to be partners in their own health care.

      "body": "<p>Classic FM has announced the results of its annual Eastertide contest for the nation's favourite piece of classical music - the first of the new millennium. The winner was the violin concerto in G minor by Max Bruch. Runner-up was Rachmaninov's piano concerto no 2 in C minor. This is the same result as last year. And the year before. And the year before that. Also in 1996, when the exercise started. The only change at the top of the table has been at number three, where Beethoven's Pastoral symphony, which finished in this position in 1996 and 1997, was displaced by the Mozart clarinet concerto in 1998. And in 1999. And again this year.</p> <p>The station is keen to point out that the margin by which Bruch beat off Rachmaninov was narrower this year than last.

      "bodyText": "Classic FM has announced the results of its annual Eastertide contest for the nation's favourite piece of classical music - the first of the new millennium. The winner was the violin concerto in G minor by Max Bruch. Runner-up was Rachmaninov's piano concerto no 2 in C minor. This is the same result as last year. And the year before. And the year before that. Also in 1996, when the exercise started. The only change at the top of the table has been at number three, where Beethoven's Pastoral symphony, which finished in this position in 1996 and 1997, was displaced by the Mozart clarinet concerto in 1998. And in 1999. And again this year. The station is keen to point out that the margin by which Bruch beat off Rachmaninov was narrower this year than last. And lower down the table there are some encouraging signs of what psephologists call churning, with Vivaldi's inescapable Four Seasons, 11th in 1996, now sagging at 29th, while some nifty cornering at the chicane has swept Samuel Barber's equally omnipresent Adagio past it to sixth.

      "byline": "Adam Sweeting",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>TV writers seem to believe that setting a story in Wales automatically establishes an atmosphere of primitive mystery and existential isolation. As Michael Fry puts it in <strong> The Secret Life Of Michael Fry</strong> (C4), to Donna the prostitute as she explains how she'd returned from London to Llangrych, \"I never heard of anyone fighting their way back here.\" </p> <p>But to be fair to writer Paul Abbott and director Marc Munden, The Secret Life... squeezes full value from its rundown but characterful seaside locations, and benefits further from an excellent cast. Ewen Bremner takes the title role of the bemused council planning officer who discovers that his bosses are planning an implausible campaign to turn Llangrych into a magnet for international tourism, with the aid of lavish EU funding. The local internet-pornographer is played by an immensely sordid Michael Kitchen, while Rosie Marcel could almost convince you that Donna is different from the lamentable clich\u00e9 of the tart-with-a-heart. As Mr Wentworth-Davies, the planning supremo, Robert Pugh rants and blusters like a clockwork Mussolini. </p> <p>What Abbott's script is getting at is that a lust for power is meaningless without a sense of belonging and self-worth, and he uses the petty tyrannies of local government as a revealing satiric device. The council's lunatic pretensions are rendered extra-absurd by framing them inside a vast, echoing municipal building, as Fry looks on in goggle-eyed bewilderment. Bremner is especially good at evoking the cluelessness of a divorced single father. With Polish parents and a gay brother, he's already confused enough before he meets porno-queen Donna and finds his libido spinning off the dial. But all Donna wants is somebody to talk to... </p> <p>Surveys reveal that chicken tikka marsala is now the most popular dish in Britain. Thirty-seven per cent of women prefer a curry and a video to a night of passion. Britain's curry industry is now bigger than coal-mining, shipbuilding and steel combined. </p> <p>Regrettably, once you'd ticked off the statistics in <strong> Argi Bhaji</strong> (Cutting Edge, C4), there weren't many good reasons for watching the rest of the film. Although it was unusual to find a programme about food which didn't feature wine critics engaged in an idiocy contest or have a matching hardback book on sale in WH Smith, there seemed little point in tracking down living Mancunian stereotypes to prove yet again that curry-houses are packed with loutish lager-drinking men and shrieking women singing lewd songs. </p> <p>But there were signs that the programme had started out with loftier ambitions than merely to make Curry Uncovered. It had been shot in Manchester's Rusholme district - a mecca, if you will, for curry addicts - around the time of the Muslim Eid festival, as if director Iain MacDonald had been planning an essay in multiculturalism, viewed through a digestion-blitzing prism of poppadoms and Carlsberg. In the end, though, the festival scenes were merely wallpaper in between the scenes of boorish drunks falling face-down into plates of aloo gobi, since most of the restaurant owners had decided there was no mileage in probing into the commerce-versus-religion debate. \"You cannot mix religion with business, otherwise everybody would be bankrupt\", declared the pragmatic Taz, manager of the Mughli. </p> <p>The significant exception was Asif, from the Darbar restaurant, who succumbed to a soliloquy of self-loathing. He misses his family, and he hates Eid because it reminds him of his dead father. \"I haven't been a good Muslim, I haven't been a good son\", he lamented.

      "bodyText": "TV writers seem to believe that setting a story in Wales automatically establishes an atmosphere of primitive mystery and existential isolation. As Michael Fry puts it in The Secret Life Of Michael Fry (C4), to Donna the prostitute as she explains how she'd returned from London to Llangrych, \"I never heard of anyone fighting their way back here.\" But to be fair to writer Paul Abbott and director Marc Munden, The Secret Life... squeezes full value from its rundown but characterful seaside locations, and benefits further from an excellent cast. Ewen Bremner takes the title role of the bemused council planning officer who discovers that his bosses are planning an implausible campaign to turn Llangrych into a magnet for international tourism, with the aid of lavish EU funding. The local internet-pornographer is played by an immensely sordid Michael Kitchen, while Rosie Marcel could almost convince you that Donna is different from the lamentable clich\u00e9 of the tart-with-a-heart. As Mr Wentworth-Davies, the planning supremo, Robert Pugh rants and blusters like a clockwork Mussolini. What Abbott's script is getting at is that a lust for power is meaningless without a sense of belonging and self-worth, and he uses the petty tyrannies of local government as a revealing satiric device. The council's lunatic pretensions are rendered extra-absurd by framing them inside a vast, echoing municipal building, as Fry looks on in goggle-eyed bewilderment. Bremner is especially good at evoking the cluelessness of a divorced single father. With Polish parents and a gay brother, he's already confused enough before he meets porno-queen Donna and finds his libido spinning off the dial. But all Donna wants is somebody to talk to... Surveys reveal that chicken tikka marsala is now the most popular dish in Britain. Thirty-seven per cent of women prefer a curry and a video to a night of passion. Britain's curry industry is now bigger than coal-mining, shipbuilding and steel combined. Regrettably, once you'd ticked off the statistics in Argi Bhaji (Cutting Edge, C4), there weren't many good reasons for watching the rest of the film. Although it was unusual to find a programme about food which didn't feature wine critics engaged in an idiocy contest or have a matching hardback book on sale in WH Smith, there seemed little point in tracking down living Mancunian stereotypes to prove yet again that curry-houses are packed with loutish lager-drinking men and shrieking women singing lewd songs. But there were signs that the programme had started out with loftier ambitions than merely to make Curry Uncovered. It had been shot in Manchester's Rusholme district - a mecca, if you will, for curry addicts - around the time of the Muslim Eid festival, as if director Iain MacDonald had been planning an essay in multiculturalism, viewed through a digestion-blitzing prism of poppadoms and Carlsberg. In the end, though, the festival scenes were merely wallpaper in between the scenes of boorish drunks falling face-down into plates of aloo gobi, since most of the restaurant owners had decided there was no mileage in probing into the commerce-versus-religion debate. \"You cannot mix religion with business, otherwise everybody would be bankrupt\", declared the pragmatic Taz, manager of the Mughli. The significant exception was Asif, from the Darbar restaurant, who succumbed to a soliloquy of self-loathing. He misses his family, and he hates Eid because it reminds him of his dead father. \"I haven't been a good Muslim, I haven't been a good son\", he lamented. On a brighter note, he had some tips for clearing obstreperous diners from his restaurant. A curt \"sod off\" is normally sufficient. Under The Wire (Desperately Seeking EUtopia, BBC2) contrasted the way asylum-seekers are treated in southern Italy and Austria. In Italy, kindly priest Don Cesare hopes to convince them that \"they can have a future in Italy and Europe\". On Austria's Hungarian border, eager young patrolmen round up immigrants with the aid of radar and heat-seeking cameras and send them back. It wasn't hard to cast the Austrians as the bad guys, yet it remains to be seen how much trouble the Italian government's hands-off approach, which enables 80 per cent of asylum seekers to slip away into Germany, France and Britain, is going to cause.",

      "bodyText": "With his huge dark eyes and a smile full of mischief, five-year-old Faress Nasser is impossible to ignore as he plays in the family's living room. Officially, though, he does not exist. When Faress was born in Jerusalem on April 15 1995, the hospital refused to issue a birth certificate, arguing that his mother, Dina Khoury, no longer had the right to reside in the city where she was born. The authorities in the West Bank, under Palestinian control, also refused to register Faress's birth, rendering him a non-person. Faress's parents, Dina and Youssef Nasser - born in the West Bank but raised in San Francisco - married in 1984 after meeting in London. The couple returned to live in Jerusalem and in 1987 Ms Khoury applied to the Israeli authorities for her husband to live with her. As a US citizen, Mr Nasser could only stay in Jerusalem on tourist visas. In the years that followed, Ms Khoury's encounters with bureaucracy included the deportation of her husband in 1990. \"Until now I joke that if I knew I would have been in this misery for 15 years, I do not know if I would marry Yousef,\" she says. Ever since Israel occupied the eastern portion of Jerusalem after the 1967 war, Palestinian existence in the city has been a precarious affair. Israeli historians say Israeli rule over Jerusalem has been guided by a demographic imperative, with Israel determined to maintain the balance that existed in 1967, when Jews accounted for 78% of the population. To preserve that majority, the Israeli authorities initiated a range of restrictions on residency rights in the city. The beginning of the peace process in 1993 only made matters worse. \"This all became part of the battle of Jerusalem,\" says Barry Zinn, the human rights lawyer who is representing Ms Khoury. A Jerusalem identity card carries tremendous advantages: medical insurance, family allowance, pensions and other social benefits. Most important of all, it offers freedom. For example, Mr Nasser is legally bound to leave the city by 10pm each night, and if he should drive his wife's car, with yellow Israeli plates, it would be an offence under Israeli security regulations.

      "body": "<p>Where does one start with Classic FM's Hall of Fame, already unveiled in a 45-hour radio marathon over Easter, and now sanctified in book form as A Buyer's Guide to the Best Classical CDs? Asking Classic FM's listeners to vote for their favourite pieces based upon the music that has been broadcast on the network over the past year is the kind of election process New Labour ought to admire. If you spoonfeed your audience a pappy diet of light classics and bite-sized chunks of larger works, all seasoned with the odd bit of cross-over, and then get them to vote for their favourites, the result is more or less a foregone conclusion. Pavlov couldn't have conditioned his salivating dogs any more effectively. </p> <p>Without wishing to continue the suspense any longer, I can reveal that the winner this time, as it has been every year since the poll began in 1996, was Bruch's Violin Concerto No 1, with Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto as the runner-up. Both are undeniably fine works (though Bruch's Second Violin Concerto is actually a better piece than his first), with the right quota of big, succulent tunes to conform to the popular stereotype of \"classical\" music as heavily romantic and emotionally undemanding. It might relax you or stir you (see below) but it doesn't make you think. It is no surprise that 55 per cent of the 300 works honoured in this hall of fame come from the 19th century, for it is through this romantic lingua franca that the second half of the 20th century turned a debased form of classical music into a commodity, which is now exploited just as much by Classic FM as by the film and advertising industries. </p> <p>Not content with its main list of winners - James Horner's score for Titanic is in at 75, Michael Nyman's music for The Piano at 291, just nosing ahead of Verdi's Otello - the guide reels off all manner of subsidiary lists. So we have the top conductors, the top pianists and even the top record labels; the top 20 \"relaxing classics\" (Bruch and Rachmaninov lead that category too), and top 20 \"stirring classics\" (Elgar takes the first two spots there, with the Cello Concerto and the Enigma Variations). </p> <p>Bizet's The Pearl Fishers comes out as number one opera, closely followed by Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana and Verdi's Nabucco: in each case, surely, on the basis of one famous lollipop. Similarly because of its orchestral \"M\u00e9ditation\" (more masturbation than meditation if you take a close look at the story), Massenet's Tha\u00efs gets in at number six, one ahead of the Marriage of Figaro. All nothing to do with opera as such, and everything to do with sound-bite broadcasting. </p> <p>It's the kind of nonsense that could charitably be dismissed as harmless if it were not for the fact that, like the classical Brit awards (also sponsored by Classic FM), there is something profoundly meretricious and self-serving about the whole thing. My real gripe isn't the fatuousness of it all - though that is pretty hard to stomach - but the fact that the whole exercise seems designed to confirm in-built prejudices rather than to extend anyone's horizons.

      "bodyText": "Where does one start with Classic FM's Hall of Fame, already unveiled in a 45-hour radio marathon over Easter, and now sanctified in book form as A Buyer's Guide to the Best Classical CDs? Asking Classic FM's listeners to vote for their favourite pieces based upon the music that has been broadcast on the network over the past year is the kind of election process New Labour ought to admire. If you spoonfeed your audience a pappy diet of light classics and bite-sized chunks of larger works, all seasoned with the odd bit of cross-over, and then get them to vote for their favourites, the result is more or less a foregone conclusion. Pavlov couldn't have conditioned his salivating dogs any more effectively. Without wishing to continue the suspense any longer, I can reveal that the winner this time, as it has been every year since the poll began in 1996, was Bruch's Violin Concerto No 1, with Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto as the runner-up. Both are undeniably fine works (though Bruch's Second Violin Concerto is actually a better piece than his first), with the right quota of big, succulent tunes to conform to the popular stereotype of \"classical\" music as heavily romantic and emotionally undemanding. It might relax you or stir you (see below) but it doesn't make you think. It is no surprise that 55 per cent of the 300 works honoured in this hall of fame come from the 19th century, for it is through this romantic lingua franca that the second half of the 20th century turned a debased form of classical music into a commodity, which is now exploited just as much by Classic FM as by the film and advertising industries. Not content with its main list of winners - James Horner's score for Titanic is in at 75, Michael Nyman's music for The Piano at 291, just nosing ahead of Verdi's Otello - the guide reels off all manner of subsidiary lists. So we have the top conductors, the top pianists and even the top record labels; the top 20 \"relaxing classics\" (Bruch and Rachmaninov lead that category too), and top 20 \"stirring classics\" (Elgar takes the first two spots there, with the Cello Concerto and the Enigma Variations). Bizet's The Pearl Fishers comes out as number one opera, closely followed by Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana and Verdi's Nabucco: in each case, surely, on the basis of one famous lollipop. Similarly because of its orchestral \"M\u00e9ditation\" (more masturbation than meditation if you take a close look at the story), Massenet's Tha\u00efs gets in at number six, one ahead of the Marriage of Figaro. All nothing to do with opera as such, and everything to do with sound-bite broadcasting. It's the kind of nonsense that could charitably be dismissed as harmless if it were not for the fact that, like the classical Brit awards (also sponsored by Classic FM), there is something profoundly meretricious and self-serving about the whole thing. My real gripe isn't the fatuousness of it all - though that is pretty hard to stomach - but the fact that the whole exercise seems designed to confirm in-built prejudices rather than to extend anyone's horizons. If all the \"classical music\" someone knows is Bruch's First Violin Concerto and Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto, then they will be reassured to find that these, according to Classic FM, are the \"best\" works, and they won't be encouraged to explore any further. As well as listing the \"top\" recorded versions for each of the 300 entries (some of those truly bizarre choices in themselves), the guide does contain recommendations of the \"if- you-like-this-then-try\" variety.

Greig has written a string of hit plays - Europe, The Architect, Cal-edonia Dreaming - for Scotland's most distinguished theatres and for the zeitgeisty experimental ensemble he co-runs, Suspect Culture. At 31, he is the most eye-catching of a mini-movement of fine young dramatists north of the border. He is the most productive, too, premiering seven new works in the last year, culminating in last month's tartan Oedipus for Glasgow's Tramway. </p> <p>Greig, whose work is performed all over Europe, blames funding anomalies for his low profile in England. \"It's easier to bring a Belgian production to London than a Scottish one,\" he says. When Victoria, his first play for the Royal Shakespeare Company, opens this week, southern audiences should be as approving as their Caledonian counterparts. </p> <p>But wait - there's the mystery of The Speculator to consider. Greig's epic historical drama about the Scots banker and exile John Law, commissioned by and performed at last year's Edinburgh festival, provoked a veritable broadsheet Bannockburn, polarising critics along national lines. While the Scots praised it as \"stunningly original\" and \"as absorbing as it is visionary\", reviewers visiting from London (the Guardian's Michael Billington excepted) growlingly called it \"ponderous, pretentious and shambolic\" and \"disastrously dull\". </p> <p>\"It bamboozled me,\" says Greig, who talks to me an hour before the opening preview of his new play. \"I would read the English papers calling The Speculator a flop, and yet my perception of it was that I'd never had a bigger hit. I was sold out at the biggest theatre in Edinburgh, I had peer-group approval from the Scottish theatre community, people coming up to me in the street...\" </p> <p>So what soured the Sassenachs? Unlike Irn Bru and The Proclaimers, Greig is not Scotland-specific: his work - dreamy but guttural conceptual dramas whose characters' lives insistently overlap - reflects his country's concerns, but not exclusively. (In a spirit of accessibility, he has just axed from Victoria a football quip about the 1978 World Cup that would have 'em rolling in the aisles north of Berwick). What is most likely is that the English critics of The Speculator had a festival-bashing agenda and the Scots a tub-thumping one: the production was neither as bad nor as grand as either claimed. Still, the play is undeniably a cracker. Like much of Greig's work, it offers up variations on a theme, teasing an idea - in this case, that capitalism, like love, depends on blind faith - into innumerable theatrical shapes. </p> <p>Victoria, too, is an inquest into belief - or the absence of it. \"I think by the end of the century, something had changed about the way we believed in things, certainly in the west,\" says Greig. \"The question in my head was: what was the nature of that change?\" This is surprising. The play - another epic, surveying life in a coastal village from 1936 through 1976 to 1996 - seems only peripherally concerned with the withering of ideology. True, it employs the Spanish civil war as a yardstick for an idealism that we have lost. But the politics are subsumed by a strong spirituality - familiar in Greig's work - rooted here in the omnipresence of history and in the indomitable Scottish landscape. </p> <p>One character in Victoria, when asked, \"Are you a communist?\" replies, \"I am, sort of.\" Greig seems to relish the obfuscation. I ask him the same question, and he too hums and hahs, before answering, circumspectly, \"I'm definitely of the left.\" The dithering will hardly endear him to his critics, who have accused Greig, along with contemporaries Stephen Greenhorn and David Harrower, of diluting the Scottish stage's working-class tradition. </p> <p>\"The trouble with Scottish theatre,\" Greig sighs, \"is that it's so small that two writers make a trend. It's quite an easy thing for Scots to define the working class solely as Scottish and the middle or upper class as British or English. But Edinburgh is a city with a large and extremely powerful middle class. That's engaged with in my theatre and I'd never apologise for that.\" </p> <p>Bourgeois pride notwithstanding, Victoria toys with some of Scottish agitprop's favourite concerns - in its treatment of the 70s oil rush, it echoes John McGrath's bolshie classic The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil. More topically, the play - one of whose characters makes a mint quarrying a mountain - reflects the recent stramash surrounding the Highland toff who is trying to sell off the mighty Cuillins peaks on Skye, which he reckons he owns. It could only happen in Scotland - a land divvied into fiefdoms between fading rockers and loopy absentee lairds. </p> <p>Greig is sensitive to the Scottish debate about ownership and conservation - though his take on the matter is ambivalent. \"I like the idea that great chunks of Scotland are wilderness, I like to walk in those chunks, I believe that the nation should own that land, absolutely. But once you start writing and other voices come in to play, you start to question that... I was in the Basque country in Spain, and the landscape looks very like the Highlands, except that there were houses everywhere, there were people everywhere. You then have to question, is this a spoiled landscape or is it a populated landscape? Which is more important: people or hills?\" In Greig's reading, the 20th century represents a journey from communitarianism through individualism to environmentalism, a creed that has \"gone beyond the individual, to a point where humans themselves are regarded as problematic\". </p> <p>Victoria weaves these ideas deftly into a story of three generations' attraction to and repulsion from one stretch of Scottish coast. As in so much of the nation's literature, emigration is the great panacea. \"The advantage of being Scottish,\" Greig wrote in The Speculator, \"is that there's always somewhere better to go.\" It is tempting to attribute this recurring motif to Greig's biography: he grew up in Nigeria, studied in Bristol, and speaks without a Scots accent. \"I certainly feel that if you live in Scotland but speak like I do, if you live in Scotland and work in theatre, you can't help but be ambivalent about it. To be honest, I think if you live in Scotland at all you can't help but be ambivalent.\" </p> <p>Greig could easily leave. He is under commission to the National and the Royal Court. Recognition in England - even from its critics - seems on its way. But Scotland pulls him back, because he is helping to create something new in the national culture. \"If you exclude entertainment and music hall and talk just about the writing of plays, we are at a very young stage in that tradition. There's an excitement about that,\" says Greig - an excitement reflected in the current proposals for a Scottish national theatre. He dreams of the day Scotland has a repertoire of classic plays to call its own - indeed, it is a day he seems determined to precipitate, single-handedly. The ambition accords with what Greig describes as Victoria's preoccupation: \"My plays resonate very strongly with the belief,\" he says, \"that we can become more than we feel that we are.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Victoria is at the Pit, the Barbican, London EC1 (020-7638 8891) till May 13.</p>",

Terry Zwigoff's film Crumb gives artist Robert Crumb and his disturbed brothers an opportunity for group psychotherapy, something they may never have attempted before there was a camera present to watch it. Here's the paradox: if a film works, then its underlying contract is clearly understood, even if it is never explicitly stated; and if its contract is understood, then the film works. That's the trouble with Sex - if only Gough Lewis were a more accomplished storyteller, then we would have a clearer sense of what's going on between him as a film-maker and Grace Quek as a subject. As it is, we can't quite understand how either of them benefits from the investigation, and we are left piecing together the disparate bits of the Annabel Chong puzzle, wondering just what the deal really is. \u0095 Sex: The Annabel Chong Story is on release.",

He was educated privately and at Birmingham Art School, where he met his future wife, Marjorie Derricourt, who was studying painting. A talented illustrator, in 1928 Jones was awarded a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London, where he studied illustration and sculpture and came under the influence of Henry Moore, who was teaching there.</p> <p>On graduation, Jones worked briefly as an apprentice to the sculptor Barry Hart before joining Vauxhall in 1932. After the retirement of Eric Kennington, he was appointed director of styling, but his career was interrupted by the war.

      "bodyText": "Chinese police detained around a hundred followers of the banned Falun Gong sect in Beijing's Tiananmen Square yesterday after they staged silent protests to mark the first anniversary of the group's protests outside government headquarters last April. The symbolic heart of the Chinese capital was thrown into confusion soon after its morning opening, as scores of Falun Gong members - who follow a meditation-based, Buddhist-influenced exercise regime - emerged from among tourist crowds and began a sit-in. Some assumed the lotus position, trademark of the group, while others tried to raise yellow banners bearing its name. Plain-clothes and uniformed police then sprinted across the square and bundled protesters into waiting vans. Some of the those arrested, who included men and women of all ages and at least one child, were shoved and punched. A number of foreign journalists were detained by police and ordered to hand over their press cards, and films and videotapes were confiscated from reporters and tourists. Occasional scattered protests continued for several hours. An official at the Tiananmen Square office said only: \"It's just been a normal day in the square.\" That may not be so far from the truth. Last week a senior Chinese official acknowledged that protests had taken place in the square on an almost daily basis since last summer when the government banned the Falun Gong and began a nationwide crackdown against its supporters. The banning of the movement was provoked by last April's protest, when some 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners surrounded government headquarters for more than 12 hours, in protest against being labelled superstitious by an official publication. Chinese leaders became alarmed that an apparently obscure movement could mobilise thousands in the tightly controlled capital without the authorities finding out. It also numbered among its followers - estimated by some officials at tens of millions - government advisers and functionaries at various levels, including a senior official in the police ministry itself. The government decided to stamp out what it labelled an evil cult. One of its main targets was Li Hongzhi, the Falun Gong's New York-based leader, whose personal popularity was seen as a threat by Chinese leaders. He claimed to possess healing powers and special talents such as the ability to walk through locked windows. The authorities accused him of causing more than 1,500 deaths by urging his followers not to take medicine. A propaganda war and the jailing of hundreds of followers have led many to give up the practice. Sun Yuxi, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said yesterday that \"98% of Falun Gong followers have now seen through the movement and broken away\". But some followers simply refuse to give up. Observers in Beijing say the government has been shocked by the persistence of the Falun Gong loyalists, whose continuing defiance in the face of a massive official campaign is almost unprecedented in contemporary China. And western diplomats say the tough action by the authorities has risked alienating ordinary people who may have been disillusioned with changes in Chinese society, but were more concerned about improving their health and avoiding China's fast-rising medical costs, than with any kind of outright opposition to the government.",

Have a wedding.\" \"No. I can't take the time off work.\" \"When has anyone at that company done anything nice for you?\" \"I don't want to talk about it.\" \"I hate that job anyway. I don't know why you don't just quit.\" Patrick speaks very slowly, as if addressing a child. \"Because... I... Want... To... Fit... In.\" He looks at her in disgust, turning back to stare out of the tinted window. He puts his headphones back on.The conversation is over.
