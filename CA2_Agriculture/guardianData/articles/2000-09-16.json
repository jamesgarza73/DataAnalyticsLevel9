But fortunately garage.com has another string to its financial bow: the 'bootcamp'. Bootcamp is a 48-hour primer for would-be entrepreneurs on how to start changing the world. In an atmosphere somewhere between a rock concert and a revivalist meeting, it brings together 500 to 700 would-be business revolutionaries eager to learn how to draw up a business plan (25 pages maximum), how to perfect an 'elevator pitch' (no more than the 30 seconds it takes to travel five floors), how to get venture capitalists to stump up the cash (ask for less rather than more so you can say 'I'm fully subscribed' - at which point others will demand to be let in). </p> <p>A gifted performer, Kawasaki is by turns inspirational and self-deprecating. At a recent bootcamp in London, he harangued, cajoled and flattered his audience, his tales from the entrepreneurial front line striking a powerful chord.

This is equivalent to 4.2p a mile, compared with 46.87p per mile for cars of 1100cc and 79.94p per mile for those of 2000cc, doing 5,000 miles a year.

      "body": "<p>Over the next year, many students will get into difficulties over the rental agreements that they have recently signed. While moving into your own property for the first time can seem rather liberating, all too often it ends up feeling like a prison. </p> <p>University housing officers can talk in their sleep about cases where students have not had their deposit back when the rental agreement is over. And there is a litany of other common problems for the 1 million students who each year sign on the dotted line: landlords who do not do the cleaning job that they agreed to do; the fellow student who drops out and leaves the other tenants to sort out the rent; the worries you may have because you have not seen your landlord's gas safety certificate; the huge electricity bill that arrives at the end of the year when no quarterly bills were received in the first 10 months; and then there are mites, bugs, mice and - if you are really unlucky - rats. </p> <p>So what can you do to ensure that you do not come to rue the day that you moved in? You need to recognise that you are entering a potentially difficult world where you can minimise the likelihood of trouble if you do some homework first. </p> <p>The rental market has long attracted the opportunistic and even the downright dodgy. If you sign up for the first property you see, you could find yourself paying over the odds. If you go to the first letting agency on the high street, you could find yourself in the hands of sharks. Signing a rental agreement is the first legal contract that many students enter into with such large financial repercussions. You need to read it, talk to family and other advisers about it and understand what you are agreeing to do. </p> <p>'Students often don't realise what they are signing up to,' says an adviser in a university town. 'If you have a joint tenancy, signed by all the tenants, then they are all responsible for paying the money to the landlord even if - as happens frequently - one of them then pulls out.' The best practical solution is usually to find someone else to move in as quickly as possible. </p> <p>Even parents and other members of the worldly wise do not always appreciate the legal ramifications. If a mother, for instance, signs her name as guarantor on her child's potential rental debts, she will usually find that she has thereby agreed to be guarantor on the debts of all the other people covered by that agreement. </p> <p>The quality and pricing of the rental market varies hugely from town to town. In Leicester, for example, there is a glut of properties available and students are typically paying \u00a335 a week for a room. In Brighton, where there is a shortage, students are more likely to pay \u00a355 a week. Landlords in Leicester are so eager to market their properties that they often go to De Montfort University's student accommodation office to ask for advice. 'More and more landlords are trying to rent out properties,' says housing adviser Martin Clelow. 'The glut of properties available has meant that there has been very little increase in rents over the last couple of years.' Landlords will frequently provide a couple of fridges, a freezer, a microwave and a washing machine. They may be open to negotiation on issues such as individual contracts and how much students should pay in July and August. </p> <p>In Brighton, the University of Sussex has seen rentals rise more than 10 per cent in the past couple of years as local house prices have pushed up rents. 'The sort of houses that students want are usually those with four or five bedrooms,' says Catherine Bancroft-Rimmer, a housing officer at the university. 'But there aren't enough to go round.' While letting agents in many other areas make their money by charging the landlords, agents in Brighton can usually squeeze something out of the students. Even the best known agencies are likely to charge more than \u00a3100 to each tenant they place and demand a 'holding deposit' of \u00a3200 on each property until the contracts are signed. </p> <p>In places where there is intense competition for properties, students need to start looking well ahead. The University of Sussex starts making arrangements for autumn lets in February. Most universities run their own accommodation service, introducing landlords and tenants to each other. De Montfort is fairly typical in not visiting and vetting each property - but it does strike out landlords and letting agencies if it is disturbed by their behaviour. It recently blackballed a male landlord who kept turning up unannounced in a female household (where, under the regulations, he should have given at least 24 hours' notice). Another name struck off the list was the letting agency which would agree a rental premium with tenants but then start bartering with students over the deposit. </p> <p>Deposits are a constant source of complaints. About half of all tenants say that some deposit money is unreasonably withheld, according to the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (Nacab). The typical amount withheld in this 1998 piece of research was just over \u00a3300. A way to prevent this is to do a careful inventory with the landlord, since most deposits are withheld on the grounds that furniture has been damaged or cleaners have had to be brought in after the tenants leave. The University of Sussex recommends that students bring along a friend who can act as an independent witness when they inspect the property with the landlord just before moving out. </p> <p>Many landlords often say at this stage that the property looks fine, but then write later to say that they need to pay to restore it to its previous condition. But if they have made their initial comment in front of a third party, they might then be less inclined to change their mind. Many students are now routinely withholding the final month of their rent because they expect their deposit to be withheld. As a result, many landlords are now asking for more than one month's rent as a deposit. In any case it is potentially a dangerous move to make since the tenants are in breach of contract. </p> <p>Another major problem area is the landlord who does little to stop the fungus creeping up the kitchen wall or to fight off the rats. 'Put your request in writing,' says Bancroft-Rimmer. 'That normally gets the landlord to hurry up, and it is proof that you asked.' CABs will give help on this sort of issue and will, if requested, contact the local authority if it believes a property is 'unfit' for habitation. Landlords have to meet basic standards when they let out property. They are under legal obligations to get a gas safety certificate each year, for instance, and they also have to react quickly if they are told of other health-threatening developments. </p> <p>But students also have to be wary of themselves. Many forget that they are, in most circumstances, directly liable to the electricity, gas and other utility suppliers. It is far better to sort a regular billing system at the start of the year rather than have a shock at the end.

      "bodyText": "Over the next year, many students will get into difficulties over the rental agreements that they have recently signed. While moving into your own property for the first time can seem rather liberating, all too often it ends up feeling like a prison. University housing officers can talk in their sleep about cases where students have not had their deposit back when the rental agreement is over. And there is a litany of other common problems for the 1 million students who each year sign on the dotted line: landlords who do not do the cleaning job that they agreed to do; the fellow student who drops out and leaves the other tenants to sort out the rent; the worries you may have because you have not seen your landlord's gas safety certificate; the huge electricity bill that arrives at the end of the year when no quarterly bills were received in the first 10 months; and then there are mites, bugs, mice and - if you are really unlucky - rats. So what can you do to ensure that you do not come to rue the day that you moved in? You need to recognise that you are entering a potentially difficult world where you can minimise the likelihood of trouble if you do some homework first. The rental market has long attracted the opportunistic and even the downright dodgy. If you sign up for the first property you see, you could find yourself paying over the odds. If you go to the first letting agency on the high street, you could find yourself in the hands of sharks. Signing a rental agreement is the first legal contract that many students enter into with such large financial repercussions. You need to read it, talk to family and other advisers about it and understand what you are agreeing to do. 'Students often don't realise what they are signing up to,' says an adviser in a university town. 'If you have a joint tenancy, signed by all the tenants, then they are all responsible for paying the money to the landlord even if - as happens frequently - one of them then pulls out.' The best practical solution is usually to find someone else to move in as quickly as possible. Even parents and other members of the worldly wise do not always appreciate the legal ramifications. If a mother, for instance, signs her name as guarantor on her child's potential rental debts, she will usually find that she has thereby agreed to be guarantor on the debts of all the other people covered by that agreement. The quality and pricing of the rental market varies hugely from town to town. In Leicester, for example, there is a glut of properties available and students are typically paying \u00a335 a week for a room. In Brighton, where there is a shortage, students are more likely to pay \u00a355 a week. Landlords in Leicester are so eager to market their properties that they often go to De Montfort University's student accommodation office to ask for advice.

      "body": "<p>More than a third of us would like to work flexible hours, and more than a quarter would like to work from home, according to a new survey on work-life balance published by the Department for Education and Employment earlier this month. Research from the TUC last week comes to similar conclusions: five out of six of us enjoy the job we do, but as a nation we are working long hours and feeling the strain. </p> <p>The idea that a happy worker is a better worker may not exactly be novel, but it has been gaining currency of late. An increasing number of companies are endeavouring to measure and improve the satisfaction of their employees on an ongoing basis through that annual paper-filling exercise, the staff survey. </p> <p>It may seem an obvious question, but why do employers want to know how satisfied we are at work? For service-oriented organisations, one answer is that there is a direct link between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction, according to John Hughes, principal of the Customer Service Network. He says: 'When I worked at Birmingham Midshires building society, we had Mori survey every member of staff anonymously, and independently we had a programme measuring customer satisfaction. When we looked at the two sets of scores, we found there was a direct correlation: branches with happy staff scored well with customers, and vice versa.' </p> <p>According to Mike Emmott, an adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development, most large organisations routinely conduct a staff survey every year; small companies are far less likely to bother as they have a greater level of face to face contact. 'Managers may think they know what employees feel about their jobs, but in practice they don't ask these sorts of questions on a daily basis. So it's a way of deepening their understanding of employees.' </p> <p>There is no prescribed formula for what an employer should ask. 'Are you satisfied with your work?' is a pretty obvious question, but others range from 'Do you feel secure?' to 'Do you understand the company's objectives?' and even 'How do you rate the level of clean liness in the washroom?'. Employers may well have an agenda of their own, for example to find out whether particular initiatives are working, or whether specific messages are getting through. </p> <p>Karen Wisdom, associate director at Mori Employee Research, says one of her first steps when brought in by an employer is often to talk to employees and find out which issues should be included in the survey. </p> <p>Nevertheless, workers faced with a questionnaire for the first time are often apprehensive. Wisdom says: 'You encounter a lot of suspicion and cynicism from staff. Mainly it is a fear of their anonymity being lost, and a suspicion as to the company's motives.' She has seen questionnaires deliberately defaced - in one instance a banana skin was sent through the post. Wisdom says that to allay any suspicions, it is vital for management to communicate what the survey is about from the outset. She believes that using an independent company such as Mori also removes fears about anonymity not being respected. </p> <p>The most common failure with staff surveys, it is generally agreed, occurs when expectations are raised but the results are not acted upon. That may be because senior managers didn't buy in to the survey in the first place. If follow-up is minimal, it is much harder to get employees to take the survey seriously in subsequent years. </p> <p>'If no action is taken, a survey can actually be counterproductive,' says David Tong, senior project director at International Survey Research. He says employers must also be prepared to share the main results with employees, although they may want to put some of the figures in context. For example, around 60-70 per cent of employees will typically say that they are satisfied with their job; but the number saying they are satisfied with their pay is generally around 40 per cent. </p> <p>One reason for this may be tactical. If everybody says they are happy with their pay, it will not help when the annual pay rise is negotiated. But Mike Emmott says that evidence from national surveys, which are not com missioned by employers, is that long hours and the work-life balance are the biggest causes of dissatisfaction. </p> <p>The rate of response to an employee survey may depend on the method used. Once, questionnaires would have been handed out in the workplace, or distributed in pigeonholes, but some employers now post them to home addresses. As well as ensuring that they receive it, this gives them a more relaxed opportunity to fill it in. </p> <p>Electronic surveys are also gaining ground, mainly as a cost-saving mea sure. Usually this involves filling in a questionnaire on a website. But here employees may worry that their contribution is not anonymous: one way Mori has countered this is by allowing employees to take a randomly generated password before they enter the site. </p> <p>But staff surveys do not always have to be anonymous. TNT Express Services offers employees a choice over whether to put their name on the questionnaire. Those who do are promised a meeting with a manager to discuss their feedback, which is a huge commitment for the company, but is regarded as a way of ensuring the process is taken seriously. </p> <p>Chris Fowkes, TNT's director of quality, says: 'There are only a small minority who don't put down their names, and that may be because we have a very open culture here. Most of us have come up through the depots, and we don't have a blame culture.' </p> <p>Last year, TNT received a 75 per cent response to its staff survey, with a remarkable 76 per cent of employees saying they were 'completely contented'. Some cynics will continue to believe that staff surveys owe more to public relations than to a genuine desire to improve things but unions, once hostile to the idea, are among those who have been won over. Ultimately, any voice, even an imperfect one, is better than no voice at all. </p> <p>As Wisdom puts it: 'I still occasionally come across people who say: \"I've been working here for 10 years, and nobody has ever asked me what I think of it\".'</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than a third of us would like to work flexible hours, and more than a quarter would like to work from home, according to a new survey on work-life balance published by the Department for Education and Employment earlier this month. Research from the TUC last week comes to similar conclusions: five out of six of us enjoy the job we do, but as a nation we are working long hours and feeling the strain. The idea that a happy worker is a better worker may not exactly be novel, but it has been gaining currency of late. An increasing number of companies are endeavouring to measure and improve the satisfaction of their employees on an ongoing basis through that annual paper-filling exercise, the staff survey. It may seem an obvious question, but why do employers want to know how satisfied we are at work? For service-oriented organisations, one answer is that there is a direct link between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction, according to John Hughes, principal of the Customer Service Network. He says: 'When I worked at Birmingham Midshires building society, we had Mori survey every member of staff anonymously, and independently we had a programme measuring customer satisfaction. When we looked at the two sets of scores, we found there was a direct correlation: branches with happy staff scored well with customers, and vice versa.' According to Mike Emmott, an adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development, most large organisations routinely conduct a staff survey every year; small companies are far less likely to bother as they have a greater level of face to face contact. 'Managers may think they know what employees feel about their jobs, but in practice they don't ask these sorts of questions on a daily basis. So it's a way of deepening their understanding of employees.' There is no prescribed formula for what an employer should ask. 'Are you satisfied with your work?' is a pretty obvious question, but others range from 'Do you feel secure?' to 'Do you understand the company's objectives?' and even 'How do you rate the level of clean liness in the washroom?'. Employers may well have an agenda of their own, for example to find out whether particular initiatives are working, or whether specific messages are getting through. Karen Wisdom, associate director at Mori Employee Research, says one of her first steps when brought in by an employer is often to talk to employees and find out which issues should be included in the survey. Nevertheless, workers faced with a questionnaire for the first time are often apprehensive. Wisdom says: 'You encounter a lot of suspicion and cynicism from staff. Mainly it is a fear of their anonymity being lost, and a suspicion as to the company's motives.' She has seen questionnaires deliberately defaced - in one instance a banana skin was sent through the post. Wisdom says that to allay any suspicions, it is vital for management to communicate what the survey is about from the outset. She believes that using an independent company such as Mori also removes fears about anonymity not being respected. The most common failure with staff surveys, it is generally agreed, occurs when expectations are raised but the results are not acted upon. That may be because senior managers didn't buy in to the survey in the first place. If follow-up is minimal, it is much harder to get employees to take the survey seriously in subsequent years. 'If no action is taken, a survey can actually be counterproductive,' says David Tong, senior project director at International Survey Research. He says employers must also be prepared to share the main results with employees, although they may want to put some of the figures in context. For example, around 60-70 per cent of employees will typically say that they are satisfied with their job; but the number saying they are satisfied with their pay is generally around 40 per cent. One reason for this may be tactical. If everybody says they are happy with their pay, it will not help when the annual pay rise is negotiated. But Mike Emmott says that evidence from national surveys, which are not com missioned by employers, is that long hours and the work-life balance are the biggest causes of dissatisfaction. The rate of response to an employee survey may depend on the method used. Once, questionnaires would have been handed out in the workplace, or distributed in pigeonholes, but some employers now post them to home addresses. As well as ensuring that they receive it, this gives them a more relaxed opportunity to fill it in. Electronic surveys are also gaining ground, mainly as a cost-saving mea sure. Usually this involves filling in a questionnaire on a website. But here employees may worry that their contribution is not anonymous: one way Mori has countered this is by allowing employees to take a randomly generated password before they enter the site. But staff surveys do not always have to be anonymous. TNT Express Services offers employees a choice over whether to put their name on the questionnaire. Those who do are promised a meeting with a manager to discuss their feedback, which is a huge commitment for the company, but is regarded as a way of ensuring the process is taken seriously. Chris Fowkes, TNT's director of quality, says: 'There are only a small minority who don't put down their names, and that may be because we have a very open culture here. Most of us have come up through the depots, and we don't have a blame culture.' Last year, TNT received a 75 per cent response to its staff survey, with a remarkable 76 per cent of employees saying they were 'completely contented'. Some cynics will continue to believe that staff surveys owe more to public relations than to a genuine desire to improve things but unions, once hostile to the idea, are among those who have been won over. Ultimately, any voice, even an imperfect one, is better than no voice at all. As Wisdom puts it: 'I still occasionally come across people who say: \"I've been working here for 10 years, and nobody has ever asked me what I think of it\".'",

      "body": "<p>Brazil is the sleeping giant of global tourism. It is the world's fifth largest country, has the world's largest rainforest (the Amazon), the world's largest swampland (the Pantanal), thousands of miles of tropical beaches, and an enviably rich musical, culinary and architectural heritage. </p> <p>Just the sort of place, you might think, to go on holiday. </p> <p>But Brazil has never fulfilled its potential. It is a baffling statistic that tourists travel in far greater numbers to Argentina, which is several hours further away by plane and offers arguably less variety of activity. </p> <p>The last available figures show that in 1998 4.8 million visited Argentina, compared to 3.1m for Brazil. Britons, too, prefer Argentina to its larger, northern neighbour. </p> <p>Brazil's consistent state of underachievement can, in part, be explained by its poor infrastructure, itself partly the result of its own vastness. There is also the perceived threat of violence in cities such as Rio de Janeiro. And it doesn't help that in Brazil people speak Portuguese instead of the more visitor-friendly Spanish. </p> <p>However, this year the giant has begun to stir. A mixture of unconnected factors, such as the country's 500th anniversary of its sighting by Portuguese sailors and the rise of the supermodel Giselle Bundchen, have generated a new wave of international interest. </p> <p>This month sees the launch of a tourist resort near the north-eastern city of Salvador that aims to be the first major package destination for European and north American travellers. Tour operator Unijet is offering packages to Brazil for the first time next year. </p> <p>Without a doubt, the Costa do Sau\u00edpe resort is causing travel companies to look at Brazil through different eyes. Airtours will next year begin direct flights to Salvador from Gatwick in order to service the resort. At present, all scheduled flights come into the country via the business centre S\u00e3o Paulo, adding several hours to most tourists' journeys, so the Airtours flight will be opening up a part of Brazil previously only known to committed travellers. </p> <p>Salvador and the Costa do Sau\u00edpe are both in Bahia, a state the size of France that has a diversity of attractions - from colonial cities to fishing villages, from deserted beaches to spectacular canyons. It is waiting to be explored. </p> <p> An hour's drive north of Salvador's international airport, Costa do Sau\u00edpe is an ambitious attempt to build a Cancun-style resort. </p> <p>The builders claim it is the largest tourism development in South America. So far it has cost more than \u00a3120m and includes two five-star and three four-star hotels. Capacity is 4,000 rooms, although this will be expanded to 10,000. </p> <p>Costa do Sau\u00edpe is situated in a beautiful and hitherto-undeveloped stretch of coastline. The emphasis from the beginning has been on pre serving the ecosystem as much as possible. During construction, the builders relocated 32,000 plants and 586 animals, including a rare sloth. </p> <p>One part of the resort is designed in the colonial style of the old town in Salvador. Special hybrid grass was developed for a golf course that the managers hope will eventually attract a leg of the PGA tour. </p> <p>The resort offers sports such as tennis, beach activities, nightlife and shopping facilities. There will also be concerts of Bahian music and other demonstrations of Brazilian culture. </p> <p>The Costa do Sau\u00edpe information line is on 00 55 71 354 9696. English is spoken. </p> <p> Salvador was the first capital of Brazil. It was also the main arrival port for slaves being imported from the Portuguese colonies in Africa. As a result, it has the highest proportion of black people in Brazil and, not unnaturally, is the centre of Afro-Brazilian culture. </p> <p>The old town is a square mile of cobbled streets, colonial buildings and baroque churches. At night, restaurants spill out on to the pavement, bands play live music and groups of drummers march through the streets. Every night is good, although Tuesday nights and weekends are busiest. </p> <p>During one week at the end of February, Salvador is home to the most exciting carnival in Brazil. Millions of people follow floats around three circuits all through the day and night. The atmos phere is so hedonistic that it is virtually impossible not to have a passing amorous fling. </p> <p>Salvador is also the best place to sample Afro-Brazilian cuisine. The fish and seafood stews should be gulped down with a ice-cold rum-and-coconut cocktail. </p> <p>A popular and cheap hotel is the Hotel Pelourinho (00 55 71 243 2324), which is in the centre of the old town. An option near the centre but by a beach is the Marazul (00 55 71 264 8200). </p> <p>Traditional restaurants for Bahian food include Barga\u00e7o (00 55 71 231 5141) and Yemanj\u00e1 (00 55 71 231 5770) </p> <p> A 20-minute flight in a tiny plane from Salvador airport takes you over the Bay of All Saints to the island of Tinhar\u00e9. The only real settlement is Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo, a small village that is the favoured destination for Bahia's monied classes. The beaches at Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo can get quite crowded but a short boatride away you can find miles of deserted sand. </p> <p>The only means of transport on the island is by tractor, which will meet you off the plane and trundle you along the beach to your hotel. </p> <p>If you prefer to avoid the crowds altogether, half an hour away on a motorboat is Boipeba, which has a handful of places to stay and is blissfully tranquil. Like most of the other beaches in Bahia, the sea at Boipeba is particularly warm and clear. </p> <p>At Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo, the best equipped place to stay is the Villegaignon Resort (00 55 75 783 1010). On Boipeba, try the Pousada do Outeiro (00 55 74 9972 1535). </p> <p>Flights can be booked with AeroStar at Salvador airport (00 55 71 204 1335). The return fare is about \u00a360. </p> <p> Ilh\u00e9us is the town that chocolate built. The centre of Brazil's cocoa-growing region, it used to be one of the most prosperous cities in South America. Its residents built themselves a belle-\u00e9poque town hall and a neo-classical cathedral. </p> <p>It still produces cocoa but has been overtaken by Africa in terms of the level of production and the city is inhabited by poor workers rather than chocolate barons. Yet it maintains a decadent charm and is worth a visit. </p> <p>There are nice beaches in the city and nearby, but chocolate remains the reason to come here: for the Cocoa Museum or the chance to see a cocoa plantation in the surrounding countryside. </p> <p> Porto Seguro means \"safe port\", and it was here that the Portuguese dropped anchor in April 1500. As a result, it became the focus this year for Brazil's 500th birthday celebrations, together with demonstrations by indians who, for obvious reasons, claimed it was anything but a reason for rejoicing. </p> <p>The first place where the Portuguese stepped ashore was at Coroa Vermelha, around 10 miles north of Porto Seguro. The area is now owned by the Patax\u00f3 indians but can be entered without permission. A metal cross stands a few metres from the shore to mark the place where the first mass is reputed to have been held on the South American continent. </p> <p>Between Porto Seguro and Coroa Vermelha, the coast road is lined with cheap hotels. Driving south from Porto Seguro, the road turns into a dirt track and leads to Arraial d'Ajuda and Trancoso, which hip and hippyish travellers have turned into Brazil's equivalent of Thailand. </p> <p>Slightly further south, the impressive Monte Pascaol completes the sights of the heavily-marketed \"Discovery Coast\" - history records that the mountain was the first piece of land spotted by the sailors when they stum bled upon Brazil. </p> <p>There is no shortage of places to say in Trancoso and Arraial d'Ajuda, both of which are more laid-back than Porto Seguro. Try the Pousada Verde Agua (00 55 73 875 1453) on the beach at Arraial. </p> <p> Bahia, like Brazil in general, has its population and industry concentrated along a thin coastal strip. Inland, you get a completely different picture: much less developed and full of open spaces. If you only go to one place away from the coast, go to the Chapada Diamantina national park, a stunning area of canyons, caves and waterfalls. It is one of Brazil's main adventure tourism destinations and offers mountain-biking, horse-riding, caving, abseiling and trekking. </p> <p>The scenery is untouched and the small colonial towns are not as yet overrun by karabiner-wielding athletes, so one can enjoy the natural beauty and tranquility at ease. </p> <p>The Chapada has a reputation as a magical place that has enchanted many foreign visitors.

      "body": "<p>If, like me, you are old enough, and committed enough, to have seen Jimi Hendrix play live more than once, then you'll know the significance of September 18 1970. It was 30 years ago on Monday that Jimi was found dead by his girlfriend, Monika Dannemann, in their London flat. </p> <p>If, unlike me, you are one of the world's richest men, then you might indulge one of your adolescent interests in middle-age with a few spare bob that you have in the bank, and create what must be one of the most extraordinary museums in the world. </p> <p>That, at least, is what Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and his partner Joe Patton, have done in creating the Experience Music Project. Designed by Canadian architect Frank Gehry, the building looks like half a dozen balls of brightly-coloured Playdough shaped by a giant's hands, with a few broken guitar fretboards thrown on the top for good measure. </p> <p>Straddling the Seattle monorail, which clatters between the Seattle Center and the downtown Westlake Center (an early prototype for the ubiquitous shopping mall), the Project opened in June and demonstrates what can be achieved by a consuming passion and seemingly-unlimited resources. </p> <p>Seattle is an appropriate setting for such an imaginative and ambitious project. The home of Starbucks, Boeing and Microsoft and the setting for Frasier and Free Willy, it has become the most desirable alternative location for Californians fed up with increasing pollution. It was also the birthplace of one James Marshall Hendrix on November 27 1942. </p> <p>Not surprisingly then, large portions of the museum are devoted to Hendrix's life, work and ideas. On entering, you are equipped with a shoulder-slung guide, consisting of a CD-Rom player and a hand-held LCD display and keypad which you point at exhibits to hear more information about them through the headphone set. As my 11-year-old son discovered, this is enough to sustain the interest of those who have never even heard of Jimi Hendrix. </p> <p>The state-of-the-art guide is handed to you in the main entrance area, which is called the Sky Church, a name coined by Jimi to describe an area where people come together to share a sense of communion through music. It is a performance area capable of holding 650 people with the largest indoor LCD screen in the world. </p> <p>One whole gallery is devoted to artefacts associated with his band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, including Jimi's favourite guitar, the white Fender Stratocaster he played at Woodstock, Noel Redding's bass, and Mitch Mitchell's drum-kit. </p> <p>The only exhibit visitors have any hope of physically touching is the guitar and, if like me you are over 6ft tall, you can just reach over the plexiglass barrier and touch it. As I discovered, this immediately sets off the alarm, but if you stay cool and pretend it has nothing to do with you, then you should get away with it. In any event, I know Jimi would have approved. </p> <p>In another gallery covering the history of rock music, a stage outfit worn by Janis Joplin is on display, along with one of Elvis's leather biking jackets.

The first of these, Funk Blast, is, not surprisingly, a journey through the world of funk music. You begin by watching a short video describing the basics of funk, before moving up a ramp around a giant multi-coloured boot signed by funk stars and surrounded by video screens preparing you for your ride. </p> <p>The ride is a standard flight simulator with a very non-standard visual experience that takes you through tunnels of funk, on stage, and out into the street with a range of ridiculously dressed musicians. You come to the end by almost disappearing down the gap between James Brown's front teeth. </p> <p>There's no doubt that this is a museum with a difference, and whether or not you are a fan of Jimi Hendrix, it more than deserves a visit for the imagination that has gone into it. Be warned, however, that some preciously-held beliefs might be shattered. I always thought Purple Haze was a song about a psychedelic drug experience, but driving around I realised that it refers to the lavender farms that abound in the Seattle area and advertise their purple haze on roadside billboards. </p> <p>You can also visit Jimi's grave in Greenwood Memor ial Park, Renton, a suburb of Seattle, which you can reach in half an hour by car.

      "bodyText": "If, like me, you are old enough, and committed enough, to have seen Jimi Hendrix play live more than once, then you'll know the significance of September 18 1970. It was 30 years ago on Monday that Jimi was found dead by his girlfriend, Monika Dannemann, in their London flat. If, unlike me, you are one of the world's richest men, then you might indulge one of your adolescent interests in middle-age with a few spare bob that you have in the bank, and create what must be one of the most extraordinary museums in the world. That, at least, is what Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and his partner Joe Patton, have done in creating the Experience Music Project. Designed by Canadian architect Frank Gehry, the building looks like half a dozen balls of brightly-coloured Playdough shaped by a giant's hands, with a few broken guitar fretboards thrown on the top for good measure. Straddling the Seattle monorail, which clatters between the Seattle Center and the downtown Westlake Center (an early prototype for the ubiquitous shopping mall), the Project opened in June and demonstrates what can be achieved by a consuming passion and seemingly-unlimited resources. Seattle is an appropriate setting for such an imaginative and ambitious project. The home of Starbucks, Boeing and Microsoft and the setting for Frasier and Free Willy, it has become the most desirable alternative location for Californians fed up with increasing pollution. It was also the birthplace of one James Marshall Hendrix on November 27 1942. Not surprisingly then, large portions of the museum are devoted to Hendrix's life, work and ideas. On entering, you are equipped with a shoulder-slung guide, consisting of a CD-Rom player and a hand-held LCD display and keypad which you point at exhibits to hear more information about them through the headphone set. As my 11-year-old son discovered, this is enough to sustain the interest of those who have never even heard of Jimi Hendrix. The state-of-the-art guide is handed to you in the main entrance area, which is called the Sky Church, a name coined by Jimi to describe an area where people come together to share a sense of communion through music. It is a performance area capable of holding 650 people with the largest indoor LCD screen in the world. One whole gallery is devoted to artefacts associated with his band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, including Jimi's favourite guitar, the white Fender Stratocaster he played at Woodstock, Noel Redding's bass, and Mitch Mitchell's drum-kit. The only exhibit visitors have any hope of physically touching is the guitar and, if like me you are over 6ft tall, you can just reach over the plexiglass barrier and touch it. As I discovered, this immediately sets off the alarm, but if you stay cool and pretend it has nothing to do with you, then you should get away with it. In any event, I know Jimi would have approved. In another gallery covering the history of rock music, a stage outfit worn by Janis Joplin is on display, along with one of Elvis's leather biking jackets.

      "body": "<p>The glorious white-sand beach was deserted except for a smiling waiter bringing a refreshing glass of freshly-squeezed mango juice. Could this really be Bali? Its popular image is of a fading tropical paradise ruined by legions of young surfers, its roads clogged with coaches in search of the last remnants of local culture. </p> <p>But last weekend at opposite ends of the island, I twice experienced that kind of laid-back luxury (the second time, the waiter was bringing a mixture of pineapple juice, banana and fresh coconut milk). With a little searching, you will find that Bali still has oodles of magical charm unspoilt by mass tourism. </p> <p>My first stop was the 19,000-hectare West Bali National Park. Until recently, its distance from the tourist centres in the south (four hours along winding roads) and lack of upmarket accommodation has deterred all but a handful of wildlife lovers, divers and backpackers who don't mind roughing it. </p> <p>The good news for people who require a little more comfort is that the first hotel has now opened. At first glance, Waka Shorea seems nothing special as far as upper-end Asian resorts go. A bungalow with only a shower and no bath or air-conditioning costs \u00a3100 a night with breakfast. Nightlife in non-existent. But although the price is hardly justified by the facilities, this is more than made up for by the surroundings. </p> <p>There is no road to the resort. Visitors are brought in by motorboat unless the sea is very rough, when the choice is a bumpy 20-minute ride on the back of a motorbike or a one-hour walk. </p> <p>Thirty seconds after leaving my bungalow, I was ambling down a trail engulfed in a cloud of butterflies. Most were white with black tips to their wings but there were occasional splashes of brown, red, orange and blue. </p> <p>Within half an hour, I had also seen two of the three local species of deer and two types of monkey, and had almost been decapitated by an over-enthusiastic sea eagle. The only prize I missed was the Bali starling, one of the world's most endangered birds - at the last count, only 14 were found living in the wild, all in the national park. </p> <p>The following morning, it was time to go scuba diving. Manjangan island, widely agreed to be Bali's best dive site, is less than 10 minutes away by boat. Being part of the national park, its coral and marine life have been protected from the cyanide and bombs that have wrecked many other parts of Indonesia. Visibility at 90ft below the surface was well over 100ft, the coral formations were up to 10ft high and the fish numerous and colourful. The snorkelling was also great and a lot cheaper. </p> <p>While Waka Shorea is the only hotel actually in the park, there are cheaper alternatives just beyond the boundaries of the protected area. Several losmen (Indonesian guesthouses) can be found in Gilimanuk, which is where the informative park headquarters is located. These range from \u00a32.50 a night for a spartan room to about \u00a313 for something a little more comfortable. </p> <p>At the other end of the scale, the Mimpi Manjangan (which claims to be in the heart of the park but is actually a couple of miles beyond the eastern boundary) has rooms ranging from \u00a376 to \u00a3275. </p> <p>It was impossible to hurry from the national park to my next destination, Bunutan, on the far eastern tip of the island. For starters, the northern coast road is not great, and, for \u00a313 a day, I had not hired the best car on the road. </p> <p>Also, there were so many distractions in the form of traditional ceremonies. No one minded in Air Sanih that the road was blocked for 20 minutes as a bridal party made its way through the village to the temple. A couple of miles down the road the whole village was on the black-sand beach giving offerings to their local deity. I could only stare in awe at how the women walked with 4ft-high arrangements of fruit, bougainvillea and coconut palms stacked on their heads. </p> <p>In the seven places I stopped, I met only two other tourists. Clearly, these villagers had not decked themselves up in their finery and built amazingly elaborate wooden models of fish, bulls and other animals on the offchance that a busload of tourists would turn up and give them some money.

      "bodyText": "The glorious white-sand beach was deserted except for a smiling waiter bringing a refreshing glass of freshly-squeezed mango juice. Could this really be Bali? Its popular image is of a fading tropical paradise ruined by legions of young surfers, its roads clogged with coaches in search of the last remnants of local culture. But last weekend at opposite ends of the island, I twice experienced that kind of laid-back luxury (the second time, the waiter was bringing a mixture of pineapple juice, banana and fresh coconut milk). With a little searching, you will find that Bali still has oodles of magical charm unspoilt by mass tourism. My first stop was the 19,000-hectare West Bali National Park. Until recently, its distance from the tourist centres in the south (four hours along winding roads) and lack of upmarket accommodation has deterred all but a handful of wildlife lovers, divers and backpackers who don't mind roughing it. The good news for people who require a little more comfort is that the first hotel has now opened. At first glance, Waka Shorea seems nothing special as far as upper-end Asian resorts go. A bungalow with only a shower and no bath or air-conditioning costs \u00a3100 a night with breakfast. Nightlife in non-existent. But although the price is hardly justified by the facilities, this is more than made up for by the surroundings. There is no road to the resort. Visitors are brought in by motorboat unless the sea is very rough, when the choice is a bumpy 20-minute ride on the back of a motorbike or a one-hour walk. Thirty seconds after leaving my bungalow, I was ambling down a trail engulfed in a cloud of butterflies. Most were white with black tips to their wings but there were occasional splashes of brown, red, orange and blue. Within half an hour, I had also seen two of the three local species of deer and two types of monkey, and had almost been decapitated by an over-enthusiastic sea eagle. The only prize I missed was the Bali starling, one of the world's most endangered birds - at the last count, only 14 were found living in the wild, all in the national park. The following morning, it was time to go scuba diving. Manjangan island, widely agreed to be Bali's best dive site, is less than 10 minutes away by boat. Being part of the national park, its coral and marine life have been protected from the cyanide and bombs that have wrecked many other parts of Indonesia. Visibility at 90ft below the surface was well over 100ft, the coral formations were up to 10ft high and the fish numerous and colourful. The snorkelling was also great and a lot cheaper. While Waka Shorea is the only hotel actually in the park, there are cheaper alternatives just beyond the boundaries of the protected area. Several losmen (Indonesian guesthouses) can be found in Gilimanuk, which is where the informative park headquarters is located. These range from \u00a32.50 a night for a spartan room to about \u00a313 for something a little more comfortable. At the other end of the scale, the Mimpi Manjangan (which claims to be in the heart of the park but is actually a couple of miles beyond the eastern boundary) has rooms ranging from \u00a376 to \u00a3275. It was impossible to hurry from the national park to my next destination, Bunutan, on the far eastern tip of the island. For starters, the northern coast road is not great, and, for \u00a313 a day, I had not hired the best car on the road. Also, there were so many distractions in the form of traditional ceremonies. No one minded in Air Sanih that the road was blocked for 20 minutes as a bridal party made its way through the village to the temple. A couple of miles down the road the whole village was on the black-sand beach giving offerings to their local deity. I could only stare in awe at how the women walked with 4ft-high arrangements of fruit, bougainvillea and coconut palms stacked on their heads. In the seven places I stopped, I met only two other tourists. Clearly, these villagers had not decked themselves up in their finery and built amazingly elaborate wooden models of fish, bulls and other animals on the offchance that a busload of tourists would turn up and give them some money. This was true Balinese culture. Bunutan is not as remote or deserted as West Bali National Park - there are about four places to stay along the mile-long beach - but its pace of life is as sedate as the rate of evaporation from the ranks of salt pans laid out on the sand. Its lack of development can be measured by the fact that it is still a spa-free zone - now a rarity on Bali (see sidebar). Again, there is no nightlife, but then you need a clear head to enjoy the best time of day, namely early morning when you can watch the sun rise over the silhouette of Mount Rinjani on the neighbouring island of Lombok while an armada of outrigger canoes return from the night's fishing.

But however you choose to fill your day, it is worth going back to your bungalow to enjoy the freshly-squeezed juice on the deserted beach as the sun sets. Who said Bali was ruined? Pamper central Spas are not quite as ubiquitous as Hindu temples in Bali - yet - but these monuments to undiluted hedonism are being built at such a rapid rate it seems they are not far behind. With more than 500 body-treatment centres dotted all over an island 140km by 80km, Bali must surely be \"pamper central\" of south-east Asia, if not the world. Most are attached to hotels - they are now de rigueur for any resort claiming to be upmarket.

      "body": "<p> <strong> Katharine Viner</strong> </p> <p><strong> Estimated total: \u00a3600</strong></p> <p> I was in need of a quiet, beachy holiday with as little activity as possible, so went to stay with my friend Jack in his family's apartment in Gozo, a small, beautiful island off Malta. Thanks to Jack's generosity, this was not a holiday that broke the bank, but I do get a bit carried away when faced with the two words \"duty-free\". </p> <p><strong> What I spent</strong></p> <p> <strong> Flights: </strong> BA to Malta \u00a3260. </p> <p> <strong> Clothes: </strong> Three summer dresses (Selfridges, Top Shop) \u00a3150; new bikini (Selfridges, didn't wear) \u00a340.</p> <p> <strong> Books: </strong> Philip Roth, Janis Joplin biography, Anita Desai \u00a340.</p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Legs and bikini wax \u00a330; suntan lotions (Nivea, Factor 15, 12, 8, plus after-sun) \u00a335; sun-protecting shampoo and conditioner (Kerastase) \u00a315; mosquito repellent and cream (Superdrug) \u00a310; breakfast at airport \u00a34. </p> <p> <strong> Duty-free on the way out: </strong> CDs (inc Craig David with free video, Bob Dylan, Beach Boys, Cardigans, UK Garage and Ibiza compilations) \u00a380; perfume (Armani) \u00a340; vodka and cointreau for holiday \u00a320. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Cab to airport \u00a326; cab from Malta airport to ferry \u00a312; share of jeep hire, plus petrol \u00a354; cab from ferry to Malta airport \u00a312; cab home \u00a328. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation: </strong> \u00a30. </p> <p> <strong> Basics: </strong> Kitty for the week \u00a3150; share of utilities \u00a329. </p> <p> <strong> Entertainment: </strong> Dinner for three \u00a330; entry and drinks in the Grotta nightclub \u00a315; beers out (total for week, rounds at 30p a bottle) \u00a315. </p> <p> <strong> What I bought on the way home: </strong> Presents (wine, nougat, sarong for Mum) \u00a340; British newspapers at airport \u00a35; duty-free moisturiser (Clarins) \u00a330; duty-free kalhua and rum \u00a320. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a31,190 </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> It was more than I thought I'd spent, but worth every penny. And I still have the Craig David CD to dance to in my bikini. </p> <p> <strong> Will Woodward and Rachel Cooke</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Estimated total: \u00a32,000</strong></p> <p> It felt expensive before we left, mainly because of \u00a3680 for a week's stay in an (admittedly delightful) house overlooking Meloi beach in Patmos. But we spent money like Greek mineral water, and usually can't be bothered to check it. Was it a cheap holiday? No. Did we need it? Yes. </p> <p><strong> What we spent</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Flights: </strong> Heathrow-Athens-Rhodes, Olympic Airways, \u00a3646 for two. </p> <p> <strong> Clothes:</strong> Two swimsuits \u00a324, three T-shirts \u00a315, new beach towel \u00a310. </p> <p> <strong> Books:</strong> Rough Guide to Greek Islands, Carol Shields, Raymond Chandler, Adhaf Soueif, Sybil Bedford, JK Rowling, Martin Amis \u00a348.93. </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Insect repellent \u00a34; copy of the Guardian at airport \u00a30.45. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Early-morning mini-cab Hackney-Heathrow \u00a330; Heathrow Express to Paddington x 2 \u00a324; cab Paddington-Hackney \u00a316. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation:</strong> House in Patmos for seven days,<strong> </strong> \u00a3680. </p> <p> <strong> Paid on credit card: </strong> Meal in Rhodes \u00a348.86; unnecessary tip \u00a37.58. </p> <p> <strong> Money taken out of cash machines: </strong> Heathrow \u00a3202.61; Rhodes \u00a3187.02; Patmos \u00a3357.03. This was spent on: </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation: </strong> Four nights in hotels in Rhodes \u00a3185; three nights in hotels in Patmos \u00a3140. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Taxis in Rhodes \u00a310; taxis in Patmos \u00a33; hydrofoil, Rhodes-Patmos, Patmos-Rhodes \u00a380. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought out there:</strong> </p> <p> Hat and swimming trunks \u00a320; after-sun cream \u00a33. </p> <p> <strong> Activities: </strong> Entrance to Patmos monasteries \u00a315; opera tickets \u00a314, sun lounger rental \u00a316; internet access \u00a32. </p> <p>The rest was pretty much food and restaurant bills - we ate out every night save for about three nights at our house in Patmos; there we had breakfast in every day and lunch in about five days. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a32,301.48</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> Cost-wise, it was on the high side for a holiday with very little sightseeing action. But it was worth it. </p> <p> <strong> Andrew Gilchrist </strong></p> <p> <strong>Estimated cost: \u00a31,600 </strong> </p> <p> I spent two weeks in Thailand (trekking round the hills up north, scuba-diving off the southern islands, boozing in Bangkok) then a week-long bender in Hong Kong staying at a mate's. So, it was never going to be cheap. </p> <p> <strong> What I spent </strong></p> <p> <strong>Flights: </strong> London-Bangkok return \u00a3693; Bangkok- Chiang Mai rtn \u00a360; Bangkok- Ko Samui rtn \u00a3110; Bangkok-Hong Kong rtn \u00a3120. </p> <p> <strong> Books: </strong> Rough Guide to Thailand, Stalingrad \u00a326; <strong> Extras: </strong> Money belt \u00a35; shiny glasses case with snazzy pop-up lid \u00a312. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Tube to Heathrow \u00a33.50. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation in Chiang Mai: </strong> One night in crappy hostel with door hanging off hinges \u00a35; two nights in hotel (4-star) \u00a360. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Tuk tuks (taxis) \u00a320. </p> <p> <strong> Activities: </strong> Three-day trek to hill tribes \u00a340. </p> <p> <strong> What I bought: </strong> Nike sandals \u00a35; fake Oakley shorts (fell apart the same day) \u00a35; mosquito sprays \u00a310; camera and films \u00a3150. </p> <p> <strong> Entertainment: </strong> Thai boxing show \u00a35. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> \u00a360. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation in Ko Pha Ngan/Ko Samui: </strong> Seven nights' accommodation \u00a3120. </p> <p> <strong> Activities: </strong> Four days' diving \u00a3200. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> (inc Full Moon beach party all-nighter) \u00a3100. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Boat crossings \u00a310; tuk tuks \u00a320. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation in Bangkok: </strong> Two nights in hotel (inc mini bar) \u00a340. </p> <p> <strong> Activities: </strong> Dismal city boat trip \u00a38; massage \u00a35. </p> <p> <strong> Transport:</strong> Tuk tuks \u00a315. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> \u00a330. </p> <p> <strong> What I bought: </strong> Two fake Diesel T-shirts \u00a310; Thai boxing shorts \u00a35; carved teak elephant with stand, four teak bowls, two sets of teak salad server spoons, two coconut bowls for rice, giant teak plate, 11 sets of chopsticks, two pairs colourful beach trousers (not teak) \u00a350. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation in Hong Kong: </strong> \u00a30. </p> <p> <strong> What I bought: </strong> Ralph Lauren top (not fake) \u00a340; Adidas trainers (not fake) \u00a335; Johnny Walker Red Label whisky (present) \u00a310; silk dressing gown (present) \u00a3120. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Airport train return \u00a320; taxis \u00a340. </p> <p> <strong> Activities: </strong> Daytrip to Macau (inc dinner at world-famous Fernando's) \u00a360; daytrip to Stanley Beach (inc waterfront lunch) \u00a320; Sunny Paradise hot bath and massage \u00a330. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> \u00a3200 (inc vodka jelly night); plus lunch at 62nd floor revolving restaurant \u00a320; plus took pal and his girlfriend for a meal at classy restaurant (Harry Ramsden's) \u00a350. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a32,647.50</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> I am flabbergasted. I knew I hadn't exactly been tight-fisted. But having now totted things up, I clearly went bananas, blazing round south-east Asia haemorrhaging cash. I booked my flight late, which was costly, then thought: why spend all that then skimp when I get there? So I didn't. And it was worth it - especially the Full Moon party and the Sunny Paradise massage. </p> <p><strong> Mark Porter and Lizzy Hubbard</strong></p> <p> <strong> Estimated total: \u00a32,300</strong></p> <p> The first week was spent self-catering in a traditional black house by the sea on the isle of Harris. It takes ingenuity to find ways of spending money in Harris, but we succeeded by dining lavishly twice at a nearby hotel. The second week was at a hotel in Skye, which was comfortable, but creaky. It reminded us more and more of Fawlty Towers, so we decamped for the last night to a restaurant with rooms on the other side of the island. </p> <p> <strong> What we spent </strong></p> <p> <strong>Transport: </strong> Return train fare from London (overnight sleeper to Inverness) \u00a3258; ferry tickets \u00a3145.90; cab to Euston \u00a38.50;car hire \u00a3210; petrol \u00a360.43; cab home from Euston \u00a38. </p> <p> <strong> Clothes: </strong> Shoes, T-shirts (one pair of Merrell aquamocs, three T-shirts from Joseph, two T-shirts from agn\u00e8s b) \u00a3225. </p> <p> <strong> Books:</strong> Stewart Brand's The Clock of the Long Now, Lee Seldes' The Legacy of Mark Rothko, Freeman J Dyson's The Sun, the Genome and the Internet and Hugo Vickers' biography of Cecil Beaton \u00a344.62; </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Binoculars (to spy on the Taransay castaways) \u00a329.99; maps \u00a310.50; camera films \u00a312.75; walking kit (we already had the basics, but bought socks, trousers and hat) \u00a3120.45. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation: </strong> Hotel deposit \u00a380; house rental on Harris \u00a3345; house electricity \u00a312; Hotel in Skye (5 nights B&amp;B, pre-dinner drinks, one restaurant dinner, 4 bar meals, telephone) \u00a3678.99; drinks, dinner, B&amp;B for one night at Three Chimneys restaurant-with-rooms \u00a3260. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought when we were there:</strong> Fleece top \u00a343; enough tweed to make two skirts \u00a360. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> Shopping in Inverness (deli, butcher, baker, wine) \u00a3100.15; shopping in Ullapool (household supplies, groceries) \u00a345; pub lunch \u00a312.20; afternoon tea waiting for ferry \u00a34.50; Skye pub/tea shop lunches \u00a329; groceries in Harris \u00a343.20 (bag of fresh langoustines from fishermen at Leverburgh pier was free); Harris pub/tea shop lunches \u00a324; drinks &amp; dinner twice at Scarista House \u00a3203.10; supper in Inverness \u00a365; lunch in Drumnadrochit \u00a312.50. </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Left luggage at Inverness station \u00a38; film processing \u00a320. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a33,179.78</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> A lot, considering that most days were spent walking in the hills.

      "bodyText": "Katharine Viner Estimated total: \u00a3600 I was in need of a quiet, beachy holiday with as little activity as possible, so went to stay with my friend Jack in his family's apartment in Gozo, a small, beautiful island off Malta. Thanks to Jack's generosity, this was not a holiday that broke the bank, but I do get a bit carried away when faced with the two words \"duty-free\". What I spent Flights: BA to Malta \u00a3260. Clothes: Three summer dresses (Selfridges, Top Shop) \u00a3150; new bikini (Selfridges, didn't wear) \u00a340. Books: Philip Roth, Janis Joplin biography, Anita Desai \u00a340. Extras: Legs and bikini wax \u00a330; suntan lotions (Nivea, Factor 15, 12, 8, plus after-sun) \u00a335; sun-protecting shampoo and conditioner (Kerastase) \u00a315; mosquito repellent and cream (Superdrug) \u00a310; breakfast at airport \u00a34. Duty-free on the way out: CDs (inc Craig David with free video, Bob Dylan, Beach Boys, Cardigans, UK Garage and Ibiza compilations) \u00a380; perfume (Armani) \u00a340; vodka and cointreau for holiday \u00a320.

Accommodation: \u00a30. Basics: Kitty for the week \u00a3150; share of utilities \u00a329. Entertainment: Dinner for three \u00a330; entry and drinks in the Grotta nightclub \u00a315; beers out (total for week, rounds at 30p a bottle) \u00a315. What I bought on the way home: Presents (wine, nougat, sarong for Mum) \u00a340; British newspapers at airport \u00a35; duty-free moisturiser (Clarins) \u00a330; duty-free kalhua and rum \u00a320. Real total: \u00a31,190 Verdict: It was more than I thought I'd spent, but worth every penny. And I still have the Craig David CD to dance to in my bikini. Will Woodward and Rachel Cooke Estimated total: \u00a32,000 It felt expensive before we left, mainly because of \u00a3680 for a week's stay in an (admittedly delightful) house overlooking Meloi beach in Patmos. But we spent money like Greek mineral water, and usually can't be bothered to check it. Was it a cheap holiday? No. Did we need it? Yes. What we spent Flights: Heathrow-Athens-Rhodes, Olympic Airways, \u00a3646 for two. Clothes: Two swimsuits \u00a324, three T-shirts \u00a315, new beach towel \u00a310.

Activities: Entrance to Patmos monasteries \u00a315; opera tickets \u00a314, sun lounger rental \u00a316; internet access \u00a32. The rest was pretty much food and restaurant bills - we ate out every night save for about three nights at our house in Patmos; there we had breakfast in every day and lunch in about five days. Real total: \u00a32,301.48 Verdict: Cost-wise, it was on the high side for a holiday with very little sightseeing action. But it was worth it. Andrew Gilchrist Estimated cost: \u00a31,600 I spent two weeks in Thailand (trekking round the hills up north, scuba-diving off the southern islands, boozing in Bangkok) then a week-long bender in Hong Kong staying at a mate's. So, it was never going to be cheap. What I spent Flights: London-Bangkok return \u00a3693; Bangkok- Chiang Mai rtn \u00a360; Bangkok- Ko Samui rtn \u00a3110; Bangkok-Hong Kong rtn \u00a3120.

Activities: Three-day trek to hill tribes \u00a340. What I bought: Nike sandals \u00a35; fake Oakley shorts (fell apart the same day) \u00a35; mosquito sprays \u00a310; camera and films \u00a3150. Entertainment: Thai boxing show \u00a35. Food and drink: \u00a360. Accommodation in Ko Pha Ngan/Ko Samui: Seven nights' accommodation \u00a3120. Activities: Four days' diving \u00a3200. Food and drink: (inc Full Moon beach party all-nighter) \u00a3100. Transport: Boat crossings \u00a310; tuk tuks \u00a320. Accommodation in Bangkok: Two nights in hotel (inc mini bar) \u00a340. Activities: Dismal city boat trip \u00a38; massage \u00a35. Transport: Tuk tuks \u00a315. Food and drink: \u00a330.

Real total: \u00a32,647.50 Verdict: I am flabbergasted. I knew I hadn't exactly been tight-fisted. But having now totted things up, I clearly went bananas, blazing round south-east Asia haemorrhaging cash. I booked my flight late, which was costly, then thought: why spend all that then skimp when I get there? So I didn't. And it was worth it - especially the Full Moon party and the Sunny Paradise massage.

Extras: Left luggage at Inverness station \u00a38; film processing \u00a320. Real total: \u00a33,179.78 Verdict: A lot, considering that most days were spent walking in the hills. Expensive train fares, car hire, hotels, and restaurants mean that a holiday in Scotland costs us much more than one in Italy or Spain (and we have to go to Italy or Spain afterwards to get some decent weather). Ben Mallalieu, Jenny Taylor and three children Estimated total: \u00a33,200 Apart from the cost of the ferry and the apartment, this ought not to be an expensive holiday.

      "body": "<p>The British have been heading south to holiday in Mediterranean Europe for so long and in such numbers that it seems every destination has become a clich\u00e9. In Tuscany, you can't move for members of the Cabinet; the Spanish Costas are a summer camp for football fans and a rest home for retired gangsters; and St Tropez is fast becoming a theme park for subscribers to OK! magazine. </p> <p>No less of a clich\u00e9, of course, is the \"undiscovered\" corner of Europe. But visit the Languedoc, a hot, rocky corner of south-west France, and you cannot help but feel you have uncovered a well-kept secret. The Languedoc is, to use travel industry jargon, seriously underdeveloped as a destination. </p> <p>The area has always had a distinct identity defined by its own language (Occitan), a cultural heritage steeped in Catharism (a heretical strand of Christianity), and a degree of Spanish influence. Bordered by the Pyrenees to the south and the Black Mountains to the north, at its heart lies the lower Aude alley - a 100-mile-long triangle with Toulouse, Narbonne and Perpignan at the corners - which stretches in a widening plain to the Mediterranean. </p> <p>With staggering scenery, sandy beaches, ancient castles, abbeys and churches, affordable accommodation, great food, some of the most drinkable vintages in France and a local population not yet sick of the sight of tourists, it has all the elements of a classic Mediterranean holiday minus the crowds. Indeed, if you were in marketing, you would call it the new Provence. It even has its own Peter Mayle in Christopher Hope, whose book Signs of the Heart: Love and Death in Languedoc was published in paperback last month. </p> <p>Hope, however, recently bemoaned the ever-increasing Brit presence. And he's right, of course - the peace and quiet can't last. Ryanair has been operating budget services from Stansted to Carcassonne for more than two years and this summer introduced daily flights to Perpignan. Return flights start at \u00a370 a head plus tax, and nearly 70,000 people flew in between June and August. </p> <p>However, wine, not tourism, is the dominant, industry, with vines growing on every spare scrap of land; one of the great pleasures of the Languedoc is to sit in a restaurant overlooking the vineyards from which the wine in your glass was produced. The peace and quiet may not last long - the Brits are coming - but there's still time to visit without noticing. Fly cheap, hire a car and tour the castles, villages and beaches while you can. </p> <p><strong> The beaches</strong></p> <p> Do not expect the celebrity-filled golden sands of St Tropez - the Languedoc coast is a more egalitarian place than that. Typical is Gruisson, 15 miles from Narbonne. An ancient seaside town supplemented a decade ago with a marina development, the long, shallow bay is backed by rows of beach huts on stilts, which famously featured in the film Betty Blue. </p> <p>There's all the usual beach stuff to do, but a local favourite is bat and ball. The French appear obsessive about the game and it is played with gusto by men and women, young and old alike. </p> <p>The marina at Gruisson has affordable hotel accommodation and enough nightlife to keep one going. At Le Corail, a personable small hotel on the waterfront, a twin room costs \u00a340 a night. </p> <p>The marina is lined with restaurants offering menus ranging from an absurdly cheap 60F (\u00a36) for three courses to 180F for foie gras, langoustine and lobster. The seafood is of the highest quality and as long as you try and eat when the restaurateur wants you to, you can't go wrong (at one restaurant, we were told that it was too hot for the chef to cook lunch). </p> <p>Further south, Argeles sur Mer and Banyuls, the most southerly resorts in France, are a little cosier, more Salcombe than Blackpool. </p> <p><strong> Castles and churches</strong></p> <p>Central to the local heritage is Catharism, the great heresy stamped out by the Catholic church early in the second millennium. The Cathar's differences with Rome seem somewhat petty viewed from the 21st century. Essentially, they believed that evil existed independently of God, while Rome held that Lucifer was initially a good being who revolted against the creator. But in the 13th century, the Cathars belief in this dualism was serious enough for successive pontiffs to launch murderous campaigns against them. By 1244, they had succeeded in crushing the Cathars, but not before the heretics had built hundreds of spectacular mountain-top fortifications, many of which remain. </p> <p>Perhaps the most spectacular is at Querebas, 90 minutes south of Narbonne and high in the Corbi\u00e8res mountains. The remaining castle walls cling to the top of a peak only accessible from one side and commanding views of all approaches.

      "bodyText": "The British have been heading south to holiday in Mediterranean Europe for so long and in such numbers that it seems every destination has become a clich\u00e9. In Tuscany, you can't move for members of the Cabinet; the Spanish Costas are a summer camp for football fans and a rest home for retired gangsters; and St Tropez is fast becoming a theme park for subscribers to OK! magazine. No less of a clich\u00e9, of course, is the \"undiscovered\" corner of Europe. But visit the Languedoc, a hot, rocky corner of south-west France, and you cannot help but feel you have uncovered a well-kept secret. The Languedoc is, to use travel industry jargon, seriously underdeveloped as a destination. The area has always had a distinct identity defined by its own language (Occitan), a cultural heritage steeped in Catharism (a heretical strand of Christianity), and a degree of Spanish influence. Bordered by the Pyrenees to the south and the Black Mountains to the north, at its heart lies the lower Aude alley - a 100-mile-long triangle with Toulouse, Narbonne and Perpignan at the corners - which stretches in a widening plain to the Mediterranean. With staggering scenery, sandy beaches, ancient castles, abbeys and churches, affordable accommodation, great food, some of the most drinkable vintages in France and a local population not yet sick of the sight of tourists, it has all the elements of a classic Mediterranean holiday minus the crowds. Indeed, if you were in marketing, you would call it the new Provence. It even has its own Peter Mayle in Christopher Hope, whose book Signs of the Heart: Love and Death in Languedoc was published in paperback last month. Hope, however, recently bemoaned the ever-increasing Brit presence. And he's right, of course - the peace and quiet can't last. Ryanair has been operating budget services from Stansted to Carcassonne for more than two years and this summer introduced daily flights to Perpignan. Return flights start at \u00a370 a head plus tax, and nearly 70,000 people flew in between June and August. However, wine, not tourism, is the dominant, industry, with vines growing on every spare scrap of land; one of the great pleasures of the Languedoc is to sit in a restaurant overlooking the vineyards from which the wine in your glass was produced. The peace and quiet may not last long - the Brits are coming - but there's still time to visit without noticing. Fly cheap, hire a car and tour the castles, villages and beaches while you can. The beaches Do not expect the celebrity-filled golden sands of St Tropez - the Languedoc coast is a more egalitarian place than that. Typical is Gruisson, 15 miles from Narbonne. An ancient seaside town supplemented a decade ago with a marina development, the long, shallow bay is backed by rows of beach huts on stilts, which famously featured in the film Betty Blue. There's all the usual beach stuff to do, but a local favourite is bat and ball. The French appear obsessive about the game and it is played with gusto by men and women, young and old alike. The marina at Gruisson has affordable hotel accommodation and enough nightlife to keep one going. At Le Corail, a personable small hotel on the waterfront, a twin room costs \u00a340 a night. The marina is lined with restaurants offering menus ranging from an absurdly cheap 60F (\u00a36) for three courses to 180F for foie gras, langoustine and lobster. The seafood is of the highest quality and as long as you try and eat when the restaurateur wants you to, you can't go wrong (at one restaurant, we were told that it was too hot for the chef to cook lunch). Further south, Argeles sur Mer and Banyuls, the most southerly resorts in France, are a little cosier, more Salcombe than Blackpool. Castles and churches Central to the local heritage is Catharism, the great heresy stamped out by the Catholic church early in the second millennium. The Cathar's differences with Rome seem somewhat petty viewed from the 21st century. Essentially, they believed that evil existed independently of God, while Rome held that Lucifer was initially a good being who revolted against the creator. But in the 13th century, the Cathars belief in this dualism was serious enough for successive pontiffs to launch murderous campaigns against them. By 1244, they had succeeded in crushing the Cathars, but not before the heretics had built hundreds of spectacular mountain-top fortifications, many of which remain. Perhaps the most spectacular is at Querebas, 90 minutes south of Narbonne and high in the Corbi\u00e8res mountains. The remaining castle walls cling to the top of a peak only accessible from one side and commanding views of all approaches. To the south, the Mediterranean twinkles, while to the east the snow-capped Pyrenees peek through the haze. Across the valley from Querebas is the chateau at Puilaurens built on a jagged ridge 900 years ago. They used to fling non-believers to the rocks from here and peering down you gain a truer understanding of what it meant to be dashed. Now the only people hurling themselves off are paragliders drifting with the eagles to the valley floor. Another church in the Corbi\u00e8res has attracted almost as much attention as the Cathar castles but, unlike the ruins on the peaks, it still attracts 25,000 pilgrims a year. The church of St Mary Magadalene in Rennes-le-Chateau is the focus of a complex mythology that puts it in the grassy knoll class of conspiracy theories. It has been variously described as the true resting place of Jesus Christ, home to the Holy Grail and a UFO landing pad. In the late 1800s, Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re, a man of no great means, spent a fortune restoring the church and presbytery. The source of his fortune is still unclear, but one theory is that he was paid off by the Vatican after uncovering the uncomfortable truth that Christ was smuggled to France before the Romans had a chance to nail him to anything. Whatever the source of Sauni\u00e8re's loot, the tale has inspired a stream of visitors armed with eccentric theories and it lends the tiny church an air of mystery that sets it apart. But it helps to have read a theory or two before you arrive. The villages One of the gentler pleasures of the Languedoc is touring the towns and villages slowly being occupied by speculating Brits. The classic settlement has a bar, a baker, a post office, a church and a square, usually shaded by the plane trees that Napolean planted to protect his troops from the noonday heat. There are few more splendid places to do nothing. Bages overlooks the salt marshes south of Narbonne and is famous for its antique shops and its seafood. Lagrasse, a beautiful medieval settlement on the Aude upstream from Narbonne, is wonderfully bourgeois compared with many of the villages of the Languedoc, which remain pleasantly paisant . It's a sort of French Hay-on-Wye, whose cobbled lanes are full of holidaying Parisiennes and ateliers des art . Unlike many of the ancient monuments in the Languedoc, there is no son et lumiere at Lagrasse, nor a guided tour for the plebs.

And in the course of doing so, life manages a whole planet. It makes an atmosphere to breathe, and water to drink, and food to eat and then it recycles its own detritus. It hijacks sunlight and passes it around to the next user in digestible, shrink-wrapped form. Having done that, it disposes of itself, directly as nutrient for some other creature, or indirectly as a strata of phosphate or a layer of chalk or fossil limestone, or as energy to burn 1bn years later. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Austrian scientists detected bacteria, living comfortably in high clouds, reproducing themselves and - some think - serving the world by playing rainmaker, acting as \"seeds\" around which water vapour could become raindrops. </p> <p>But this heavenly host of living things surprised no one. Life has been turning up in improbable places for years. People who drilled a mile deep into the basalt of the ocean floor found tiny microbes living on a diet of warmth and rock. Submarine explorers have found huge colonies of strange creatures basking in a kind of chemical cornucopia at the bottom of the ocean's depths, far from any sunlight. Microbes have been found in acid flows, in lakes of soda, down the vents of volcanoes and on the underside of the polar ice, organising the planet for the rest of creation. </p> <p>Might things have got a little hot when carbon dioxide levels built up dangerously at the dawn of the Eocene, 55m years ago? Fear not. The rapid response team was on hand. An Anglo-American team of scientists reported on Thursday that plankton bloomed, the oceans became a garden and greedily mopped up the excess carbon, cooling the greenhouse world to acceptable levels. Not for the first time, nor the last, the biosphere had risen to the challenge, and adjusted itself. </p> <p>It is more than 30 years since James Lovelock, a freelance chemist with a background in medical research and a gift for devising sensitive detectors, worked for Nasa on the Mars exploration programme. While doing so, he began to form the idea of the biosphere as a self-regulating entity, of life and the planet as a kind of sensitive organism, not sensitive to any particular form of life, just to the principle of life. He called it the Gaia hypothesis. The novelist William Golding, a friend and neighbour, suggested the name. Gaia was the Earth goddess, the Greeks' Mother Nature. </p> <p>Touchingly, Lovelock reports in his latest book that he originally thought Golding had suggested calling it the Gyre hypothesis, after the gyres or vortexes that drive ocean and atmospheric circulation. The idea of Gaia caught the imagination of people everywhere. Gaia is a kind of metaphor for a very subtle lesson in the physiology of a planet. But Gaia became a reality, too, for the Greens, particularly those inclined to mysticism. Lovelock doesn't mind. He finds things to marvel at in Gaia, too. \"Some very distinguished scientist, I have forgotten his name, told me when I was quite young that the one thing you have got to keep right through your life or right up to your dotage is a sense of childlike wonder and once it goes, stop doing science,\" he says. </p> <p>He is fond of individual Greens, but he doesn't have much patience for some Green thinking, and in particular the Green attitude to nuclear power. Never mind the British government's little local difficulty with fuel prices, fossil fuels are literally beginning to cost the earth and meanwhile the Green campaigners are rejecting at least one easy answer to the great problem of how to power an economy without shutting down the biosphere with polluting greenhouse gases. </p> <p>This answer, Lovelock says, is ecologically clean and tidy and has a very bad press. It is nuclear power. \"I can envisage somewhere about 2050, when the greenhouse really begins to bite, when people will start looking back and saying: whose fault was all this? And they will settle on the Greens and say: 'if those damn people hadn't stopped us building nuclear power stations we wouldn't be in this mess'. And I think it is true. The real dangers to humanity and the ecosystems of the earth from nuclear power are almost negligible. You get things like Chernobyl but what happens? Thirty-odd brave firemen died who needn't have died but its general effect on the world population is almost negligible. </p> <p>\"What has it done to wild life? All around Chernobyl, where people are not allowed to go because the ground is too radioactive, well, the wildlife doesn't care about radiation. It has come flooding in. It is one of the richest ecosystems in the region. And then they say: what shall we do with nuclear waste?\" Lovelock has an answer for that, too. Stick it in some precious wilderness, he says. If you wanted to preserve the biodiversity of rainforest, drop pockets of nuclear waste into it to keep the developers out. The lifespans of the wild things might be shortened a bit, but the animals wouldn't know, or care. Natural selection would take care of the mutations. Life would go on. </p> <p>\"I have told the BNFL, or whoever it was, that I would happily take the full output of one of their big power stations. I think the high-level waste is a stainless steel cube of about a metre in size and I would be very happy to have a concrete pit that they would dig - I wouldn't dig it - that they would put it in.\" He says he would use the waste for two purposes. \"One would be home heating. You would get free home heat from it. And the other would be to sterilise the stuff from the supermarket, the chicken and whatnot, full of salmonella. Just drop it down through a hole. I'm not saying this tongue-in-cheek. I am quite serious,\" he says. \"They would be welcome to take pictures of my grandchildren sitting on top of it.\" </p> <p>Lovelock regards himself as an eccentric, and a radical, and he enjoys being a member of the awkward squad. The Gaia hypothesis was a huge delight to some, but it was a huge provocation to others. It also plunged Lovelock into a war of metaphors. Most of the battle was with the biologists, who had a different set of metaphors to defend. Some scientists, for example, call the Earth the Goldilocks planet, because Venus, hot enough to melt lead, was too warm and Mars, the frozen desert, was too cold, but Earth was just right for life. So in their view, the planet manages life, not the other way around. </p> <p>Another group thinks of the fullness and richness of biodiversity as the outcome of \"selfish genes\", hectically competing to replicate themselves. So for them, life is a battle for tenure rather than an invitation to the dance. And then along came Lovelock, a non-biologist who proposes something disconcerting: that the earth is fit for life because life made it that way. The battle was brisk, because life is the great mystery. There are three great stories that science has to tell: one of these is where the universe came from, one is where life came from and the third is where humans came from. The first and the last are being sorted out right now. Cosmologists think, for instance, that they have the story of creation figured out, except for the first 1,000th of a second. Anthropologists have settled on a consensus that modern humans emerged in Africa about 250,000 years ago, the latest and only survivors in a line of hominids. </p> <p>But the origin of life is a puzzle. Think of it as a kind of reverse murder mystery. The bringing-to-life happened in a locked room in a strange world 3.4 bn years ago. There is no surviving scene of the not-crime. There are no footprints, no strewn clues. The evidence was destroyed by the very creatures that rose from original experiments in fashioning the living chemistry from non-living chemicals. Whatever conditions made life possible were promptly erased by the action of life itself. The last surviving universal common ancestor went round eliminating all chances of new rivals emerging. </p> <p>Life came into a planet with an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, and began to alter it, producing as waste a dangerous, reactive gas called oxygen which could ultimately have brought the whole experiment to a halt. So life's - and Gaia's - next step was to favour a balancing set of creatures that consumed oxygen and breathed out carbon dioxide. But once that was done, the original atmosphere was gone, and water and nitrogen cycles were wiping away any evidence that might have been left in the rocks. </p> <p>Lovelock began thinking of such things three decades ago when he worked on Nasa's search for evidence of life on another planet. He proposed in effect that you could tell that the earth was alive from a million miles away. Its atmospheric chemistry would shout of life. He proposed that the 70s Mars probe instruments could confirm the presence of life on the red planet by detecting an atmosphere of dynamic disequilibrium. </p> <p>If there had been life on Mars, it would have been a very different planet. The atmosphere of Mars is 98% carbon dioxide and very stable. Venus is 98% carbon dioxide and a very nasty example of a runaway greenhouse effect. The earth no doubt started at 98% carbon dioxide too but today's atmosphere is a mixture of inflammable oxygen and reactive nitrogen with just a touch of carbon dioxide, and something is definitely keeping this explosive mixture primed. </p> <p>He says Nasa ignored his proposal at the time but the future search for life on planets outside the solar system will be based entirely on Lovelock principles. At some future point, fleets of spacecraft working in exquisite unison will focus on little specks of light reflected from parent stars, looking for the spectral signatures of telltale gases such as oxygen and water vapour and methane. </p> <p>You couldn't imagine oxygen and methane surviving together for very long in the same atmosphere. So if you spotted these in the gleam from a planet 30 light years away you'd start to wonder. \"If there is a lot of methane, oxygen won't rise by accident. So you have to postulate a process on the surface that is producing gigatonnes if not teratonnes of both of those gases all the time and not only that but regulating them, because if you didn't regulate them you would be in danger of making an inflammable atmosphere or something like that. So that then becomes conclusive evidence of life,\" he says. </p> <p>The American enthusiasm for possible life on Mars amuses him. \"I think it is all part of the American frontier mentality. This Mars is the ultimate place, we can go there when we have screwed up the earth. We have the technology, we can fix it. The national legend of America is very tied up with Star Trek and if you go to scientific meetings you hear Star Trek metaphors paraded around all the time and to them it no longer is a kind of story, it is reality and there is a great danger in their thinking.\" </p> <p>Lovelock is now 81. He and his wife Sandy - his first wife, Helen, the mother of his children, died after a long illness - have completed the 600-miles coastal walk from Poole, Dorset to Minehead , Somerset. He has pursued a long career as a kind of freelance scientist and he says big corporations are not for him, although he is happy to sell them his inventions. He doesn't care for science run by bureaucracies. He lives in an idyllic corner of Devon, on a 35-acre farm, on which he has planted 25,000 trees. </p> <p>He takes the long view of eco-hazards, he says. He isn't bothered by the menace of industrial chemicals like PCBs or agricultural fertilisers in the way that Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth are. A chemist from the start, he points out that according to a Royal Society of Chemistry survey, chemists live longer than most scientists. The big threat to the planet, he says, is people: there are too many, doing too well economically and burning too much oil. </p> <p>\"It's the people that count and the only message I would have to give is to stop fretting, stop looking for scapegoats, people are to blame for the condition of the earth. It is me, you, all of us that are to blame and if we are going to do anything about it we have to tackle it individually, not expect anybody to take the load off us and do it. If you are a housewife in Balham you are not, probably, doing anywhere near as much to damage the planet as suburbanites and exurbanites living around here, using their cars wholly unnecessarily in huge numbers of journeys and burning far more fuel. The more money you have, the more damage you can do.\" </p> <p>His new book is a hymn to science, and to Gaia and to the other makers of his great idea, and to the forces that made him choose to swim upstream, to stay independent, to be free to follow his nose. He grew up with Quaker principles, and became a conscientious objector in the second world war. He spent 20 years at the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, a lab with 100 scientists and six Nobel prizewinners, and then he started pleasing himself, usually by devising instruments that pleased big business, or Nasa, or the Ministry of Defence. </p> <p>He built a detector so sensitive it could trace seemingly infinitesimally small concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. Famously, he remarked that such low levels could do no harm. He should have written no toxic harm, he says. They were, of course, the chemicals that began to demolish the ozone layer. He thinks the big dangers to the planet are the greenhouse effect and the spread of humanity. Humans, just by their fecundity, and their economic demands, have begun to affect habitat and biodiversity so furiously that it might be that one day Gaia might not be able to step in and adjust the conditions to secure her own reign. The planetary regulator might not regulate so efficiently. </p> <p>In that sense, biodiversity was a kind of insurance, a spreading of bets to allow life to survive the kind of catastrophes - from outer space, or from volcanoes - that have seriously interrupted evolution at least five times in the last 600m years. Meanwhile, humans could get their comeuppance in some quite mundane but unexpected way. </p> <p>\"Every few hundred years or less, there is a natural geological disaster, like a big volcano. Tambora was the last, in 1815, and the one before that was Laki in 1783. Both of those were followed by two years without any harvest. Now in those days, people survived. There were famines, but people survived. What would happen now?\" he asks. He was speaking before the British pickets began their fuel blockade, and before panic-stricken consumers began clearing supermarket shelves. He was speaking long before word began to leak of UK government statement to be made on Monday about research into the possibility of some future collision with a large asteroid, an event which would darken the sky, shake continents, shut down agriculture and certainly clear the supermarket shelves the world over. </p> <p>He was simply taking, as he has done all his life, the long view. \"Two years without a harvest? It would probably bust civilisation. People would survive all right. It really would cut us back, and that is the sort of thing nobody really prepares for. It's not some ecological poison or GM foods or nuclear that is going to get us, it is going to be some perfectly ordinary natural event.\"</p>",

Tambora was the last, in 1815, and the one before that was Laki in 1783. Both of those were followed by two years without any harvest. Now in those days, people survived. There were famines, but people survived. What would happen now?\" he asks. He was speaking before the British pickets began their fuel blockade, and before panic-stricken consumers began clearing supermarket shelves. He was speaking long before word began to leak of UK government statement to be made on Monday about research into the possibility of some future collision with a large asteroid, an event which would darken the sky, shake continents, shut down agriculture and certainly clear the supermarket shelves the world over. He was simply taking, as he has done all his life, the long view. \"Two years without a harvest? It would probably bust civilisation. People would survive all right. It really would cut us back, and that is the sort of thing nobody really prepares for. It's not some ecological poison or GM foods or nuclear that is going to get us, it is going to be some perfectly ordinary natural event.\"",

I found myself in just such a mood the other day. I wanted to do something radical, to let the winds of revolution blow through my hair, or across my plate, so I went to Topsy Tasty. </p> <p>In an era of naff names, Topsy Tasty is in a class of its own. So naff is it, it is classic, iconic and really rather wonderful. More wonderful still, it is a smarter cousin of the sober (in the name stakes) Bedlington Cafe in one of the more anonymous terraces of shops in one of the more anonymous parts of the Chiswick hinterland south of the Great West Road, west London.</p> <p> The Bedlington achieved a certain reputation a few years ago for being among the first cafes to cross dress from greasy spoon at lunchtime to wholesome Thai neighbourhood diner in the evening. So successful has the Bedlington formula been that the same management, P Priyanu (Tim to his friends), opened Topsy Tasty, refining the concept slightly by dropping the greasy spoon bit and opening only for Thai aficionados in the evening. </p> <p>The refinement of concept has not really embraced the decor, which remains defiantly basic.

      "bodyText": "Address: Topsy Tasty, London Are there moments when you yearn for something different, a change of address, a change of job, a change of spouse, a change of hairstyle? I found myself in just such a mood the other day. I wanted to do something radical, to let the winds of revolution blow through my hair, or across my plate, so I went to Topsy Tasty. In an era of naff names, Topsy Tasty is in a class of its own. So naff is it, it is classic, iconic and really rather wonderful. More wonderful still, it is a smarter cousin of the sober (in the name stakes) Bedlington Cafe in one of the more anonymous terraces of shops in one of the more anonymous parts of the Chiswick hinterland south of the Great West Road, west London. The Bedlington achieved a certain reputation a few years ago for being among the first cafes to cross dress from greasy spoon at lunchtime to wholesome Thai neighbourhood diner in the evening. So successful has the Bedlington formula been that the same management, P Priyanu (Tim to his friends), opened Topsy Tasty, refining the concept slightly by dropping the greasy spoon bit and opening only for Thai aficionados in the evening. The refinement of concept has not really embraced the decor, which remains defiantly basic. There are a few rather engaging black-and-white photographs of life in Old Thailand, and a curious decorative motif on the ceiling, and that's about it. So you know that your bill isn't going towards paying the fee of some fancy-pants designer. It's going towards paying for the food, drink and service, which is something of a refreshing change in itself.

      "body": "<p>Last week, I wrote about enjoying your garden. This week, by contrast, you shall read about making it look worthy, in autumn, of your or any friends' presence. The sad fact is that many gardens look a shambles by now - a second flowering on some roses (leaves already stripped by rust and black spot), and that's about the sum of it. Which is our fault, not the season's. </p> <p>There is no need to cut down everything in sight, apart from shrubs, of course. But all dowdy remnants that can no longer give pleasure should go. The tarnished silver of Eryngium giganteum ('Miss Willmott's Ghost'), for instance; the over-prolific, self-sowing purple orach, Atriplex hortensis , now changed from red to brown; likewise Alchemilla mollis, which probably looks a wreck - yet if the whole plant had been shorn back in early August, it would now be covered with a new crop of young leaves. I make these latter form a background to colchicums, which are now in bloom. If there is too much self-sown honesty or fennel or teazels, most of that goes, too, leaving just a few as winter skeletons. </p> <p>Follow-on bedding is a great idea for enlivening the autumn scene. This year, we had dwarf lupins, a seed strain called Gallery Mixed, bedded out late last autumn, at the same time interplanting them with tulips, as young lupin foliage makes a handsome background to those. We removed the whole lot in early July (the bulbs stored, the lupins discarded), and replaced them with African marigolds and a mauve bedding verbena (propagated from cuttings), 'La France'. The marigolds, in orange and yellow, are fully double and in two strains: Jubilee Mixed and Treasure Trove. They make big plants and can be bedded at 0.8m intervals, each plant given one stake and a tie when large (you may be more sheltered than we are). </p> <p>Now, these were not sown till May 18, and they came into flower in late August, just when needed. By timing your sowings, you can manipulate the peaking of your displays. </p> <p>In the same way, we sowed Thompson &amp; Morgan's dahlia collerette Dandy Mixed, also on May 18, and those seedlings followed another earlier lot of summer bedding. We also (largely because we don't get around to the job earlier) take late cuttings from dahlias that we overwinter in store. They produce plants that may not be bedded out till late August, but we are seldom afflicted by frost before November, so the young plants have a good innings and they look fresh when other dahlias may be tiring. </p> <p>Begonias are great value, and we are especially pleased with a tuberous-rooted strain called Dragon Wing we received from Thompson &amp; Morgan as plugs on May 10. It has single, intense red flowers and handsome, glossy foliage. We shall save the tubers from that. </p> <p>Some seed-raised annuals have a prolonged season anyway. Ageratum 'Blue Horizon' is one of our greatest standbys, growing to 0.5m and mixing well with yellow annual rudbeckias, or with begonias. Salvia coccinea 'Lady In Red' (0.5m) is a great seed strain, and will carry two flushes of blossom in most years. It looks good with the bluey-purple Salvia farinacea ' Victoria'. There is a very long-flowering annual that I always grow, called Cuphea 'Firefly' (0.3m), with dusky, pinky-red flowers on a nice bushy plant. We save seed from that from year to year. </p> <p>Grown in pots, you'll still be enjoying heliotrope: a scented kind such as 'Chatsworth' or 'Princess Marina'. Or there's the untiring blue Convolvulus sabatius (save your old plants, splitting them a little next spring), which has a cascading habit, as do nasturtiums. We make fresh sowings of them, one seed or two to a pot up to late July. Zonal pelargoniums ('geraniums') are a wonderful standby, and I turn to them for spots of scarlet and vermilion where highlights are needed. You must keep them fresh by regular dead-heading and by rubbing out the dead centres of flower heads that still have life left in them. Remember that single-flowered kinds stand up to wet weather better than doubles. </p> <p>I must have lilies in pots, to bring forward in their season, and September gives us the Lilium speciosum hybrids and the white trumpet L. formosanum, which is quick from seed. Some perennials are very long-flowering, so you don't have to feel they are keeping you waiting for too many months before they perform - as do some michaelmas daisies. But Aster frikartii 'M\u00f6nch' (0.5m), with large, lavender daisies, is exceptionally generous, blooming from late July to October. </p> <p>Japanese anemones have a similarly prolonged season. I have one long-lasting combination with pink Anemone 'Hadspen Abundance', yellow, deeply cupped Hypericum 'Rowallane' and an umbrella above them of Rosa glauca , with bluish leaves and hips in dangling bunches, which colour now to deep red. I prune this regularly by removing all the flowered wood, in winter leaving only the long, straight new canes, which will flower and fruit for me next year. The shrub is constantly rejuvenated in this way, and never becomes outsize. </p> <p>Some shrubs give us a second flowering, notably hebes such as 'Midsummer Beauty'. The cherry laurel, Prunus laurocerasus 'Otto Luyken' is doing it this year, and I have hopes of the Mexican orange, Choisya ternata.</p>",

Despite repeated statements by Givenchy that it has \"no plans to change McQueen's contract\", due to run until October 2001, rumours persist that he is unhappy with the limits placed on his role and hankers after the input into advertising and house image enjoyed by John Galliano at Christian Dior. Designers showing in Europe have been alarmed by a suggestion that they may have difficulty persuading their favourite models, most of them based in New York, to appear on their catwalks this season, due to the grounding of Concorde - because an overnight flight would play havoc with their sleep and beauty routines. Model agencies, however, insist that their models will be happy to travel subsonically.",

      "body": "<p>Margaret Atwood would like to clear a few things up from the start. She is not a murderer (this in spite of writing as a murderer in Alias Grace). She was not bullied to within an inch of her existence by her childhood best friend (unlike the narrator of Cat's Eye). She is not a femme fatale about to steal your man (The Robber Bride), she does not have an eating disorder (The Edible Woman), and she is not a woman whose lover committed suicide (Life Before Man), nor a woman searching for her lost father (Surfacing). People often think she lives the lives of the characters in her books, she says. But they are not her. </p> <p>This is the message of her new novel, too, which could almost be read as a plea not to confuse the author with the narrator. In The Blind Assassin we have two narrators: Iris, 82 and looking back over her life, and Laura, her sister, author of a pulpy romance bestseller. Iris's story is a bitter one, a loveless tale of abusive marriage, bad loyalties and dissatisfaction. By contrast, Laura's novel within the novel is the tale of a scandalous love affair between a 30s lady in mink and a sexy young Bolshevik.</p> <p>But as time passes, the reader starts to wonder if Laura really did write the novel, and if the extraordinary events in it really did happen to her. What if it were someone else who caused the scandal? Are we right in believing that whoever wrote the novel must have had such experiences in real life? Where did we get the idea that the author is the star of their own fiction? </p> <p>It is also, perhaps, the message of our meeting. All we know and read about Margaret Atwood is that she is \"frosty\" and \"scary\" and \"witch-like\" and \"remote\". She's the \"high priestess of pain\". She's the \"authority on malevolence\". She's Medusa, Boudicca and the Queen Bee. Canadians, who know her better than anyone, warn that she's a ferocious interviewee: if she says you can have an hour, you'll get spot-on 60 minutes. She'll fight you, ridicule you, chew you up and spit you out and make you sorry you came. One writer ended an interview saying that if she ever saw her again, she'd run in the opposite direction. </p> <p>But when we meet on a sticky Toronto midsummer day, Atwood keeps suggesting more things we can do together, kindness after kindness. We go for breakfast, in her favourite cafe. And then lunch, with her husband (more of him later). A hotel for coffee and fruit and meringues. She takes me to her home, her garden. (It doesn't get much light, but has a gargoyle fountain and 10 lilies upright in a circle, tied to sticks, soldiers with rods down their backs.) She becomes my tour guide for Toronto (\"This is where I went to college; this is our legislature\"); she takes me on a tour of locations in her novels (the bridge Laura Chase drives off in The Blind Assassin; the bridge from which Elaine is led down an icy, dark and terrifying ravine in Cat's Eye; a street Roz crosses in The Robber Bride); then, even, a mini-tour of where she used to live.</p> <p>Sometimes when she speaks she puts on the voice of a child; sometimes when she's standing and asking a question she bends one leg inwards, at the knee, like young girls do when they want something. A sweet sort of intimacy. Why do people find her scary? \"They confuse me with the characters in my books,\" she says. (Don't forget. She's not her narrators, and she's not as her image would have her. It's all about what's real and what's not.) </p> <p>It is impossible to overstate just how famous Margaret Atwood is in Canada. For many years, before Jim Carrey and Shania Twain, Atwood was pretty much the only Canadian with international fame. When she started writing, there was no literary tradition; one year in the early 60s, only five Canadian novels were published. (In 1972, Atwood tried to draw some themes and conclusions about the limited number of writers in Canada's history in her extraordinary book of literary criticism, Survival.) But the fallow was fertile for her. \"I didn't feel all those genius men hanging over me,\" she says. \"Canada was a wide open prairie.\" </p> <p>Today, there's a fiction boom - Michael Ondaatje, Carol Shields, Alice Munro - and Atwood has been at the heart of it since The Edible Woman, her first novel, was published in 1969. (She had written it four years earlier, but the publisher lost the manuscript.) Her work since has been a roll call of gleaming successes, novels at once intellectual and popular, emotional and neatly- plotted: from Surfacing, her 1979 novel about a woman's investigation into her father's disappearance on a remote island, which has an emotional impact on all who read it; to the million-selling The Handmaid's Tale, perhaps her greatest work and certainly a classic, a feminist sci-fi horror story in which fertile women are turned into breeding machines; to Cat's Eye, the best novel ever written about how girls can bully each other. Three of her books - The Handmaid's Tale, Cat's Eye and Alias Grace - have been nominated for the Booker Prize. </p> <p>After 30 years at her craft, Atwood's new novel is a work by a writer who knows how to command an audience; getting out of her grasp, once you are in it, is not really an option. Readers develop quite obsessive relationships with her work. She's popular with women (her novels actually feature female characters you can believe in), but also men (she says she gets a large amount of fan mail from British men, who write to say they wish they'd read her books before their divorces - it might have saved their marriages). Atwood is taught in more than three-quarters of British universities. </p> <p>She's an industry on her own: The Blind Assassin is her 10th novel, her 37th book (she also writes poetry, children's books, literary criticism); she is published in more than 30 languages; even her assistant has an assistant. When it comes to book-signing, she has developed a system whereby an assistant passes the book or poster over to her, rather than reaching out. This was because of RSI problems. Yes: Atwood had been getting RSI not from typing, but from signing too many autographs. </p> <p>She arrives for breakfast wearing dark, loose clothing and a big, dark hat that shadows her face. Her eyes are a pale and memorable blue, her skin translucent and unlined, a trait she shares with her 92-year-old mother. (\"Good bones.\") She is tiny. She was once described as \"not like other people\", and there's something in the description - her appearance is both everywoman and strangely ethereal, her voice both quiet and impossible to ignore. Her manner, too, is unusual. This is Atwood, early in our meeting, on Prince Charles: \"If he weren't the prince or the duke or whatever he is, he would be considered a valuable eccentric person going against the grain and speaking out. A sort of Bertrand Russell or Albert Schweitzer of the food chain... He is not properly valued as an objet . If he were in Japan, he'd be valued as some precious, lacquered treasure.\" </p> <p>Her conversation is wry, educated, knowing; a bit superior, challenging you to get the joke. Later, when we're eating a fruit plate and I question the identity of an unfamiliar berry, she says it's a \"boobleberry\". I don't realise that she is making it up, using a little ridicule, at which her eyes glitter: \"We're going to have fun with you.\" (She once said that her humour was just like everyone else's in Atlantic Canada - deadpan. \"They'll tell you the most outrageous lies with a straight face.\") </p> <p>We order - or, rather, she does. \"I would like a freshly squeezed orange juice,\" she drawls, turning to me, \"and so would you.\" (I quickly nod) \"Then I would like a cappuccino,\" she turns to me, \"and so would you.\" (I nod again) \"And then I would like a toasted bagel,\" she turns to me, \"and so would you.\" This time, I shake my head, say no to the bagel. She looks perplexed, and rather thrilled, as if it were rare and fascinating for someone to say no to her. </p> <p>She opens up her grasp, and there's a handful of vitamins. \"Chewable betacarotene. Evening primrose,\" she says, counting them off. \"Glucose amine sulphates, which are good when you start getting a bit arthritic. Remember that. This is a very good kind of calcium, because it's in a gel cap. This is something I can't remember. This is vitamin C. This is a new kind of vitamin E which is supposed to be good for people who have cholesterol, which I have. Life is not fair. This is a ginger pill, which is on general principles. And these -\" she points to the biggest tablets, flecked with purple - \"are an Indian 'erb called Goo Goo lipids, which are supposed to be good for cholesterol.\" (Don't go searching for these. I'm pretty sure she made them up.) </p> <p>So it's the tablets that explain her youthful appearance? \"Actually, I'm 2,000 years old,\" she says. \"And dead.\" That Atlantic sense of humour again. Actually, at 60, she does not smoke, drinks in moderation (\"I drink just exactly the amount they say you're supposed to drink to avoid bursting, or whatever\"') and has never been out in the sun. She has facials, eats well, takes all those pills. It's not magic that makes her look so good: she's in control of what might harm her, takes steps to avoid the possibility of pain. </p> <p>It might be good advice to do something similar before you read an Atwood novel. She is a writer who revels in suffering, who describes pain so that it hurts, so that the reader feels it. One night, after reading The Robber Bride, I was awake until dawn, so deeply upsetting was her portrayal of Charis, who changed her name from Karen to try to obliterate the horrors of an abusive childhood. When, in Toronto, Atwood drove me to the bridge featured in Cat's Eye, the location of a hugely distressing incident of childhood torture in the novel, it was an overwhelming experience...ad to turn back and leave, as if from bad memories. In a way, I suppose I'd been there before - through her fiction, she'd already taken me. </p> <p>So what about this \"high priestess of pain\" label? \"I'm not responsible for other people's metaphors,\" she says. \"What that means is that I'm good at describing certain kinds of emotions. That's all it means. I also can do other things. I'm good at writing fake newspaper reports. High priestess of fake newspaper reports.\" But she describes pain so that it's unbearable, which is a shock when we think we see pain every day on television, news and dramas and chat shows and Oprah.</p> <p>\"There's a difference between describing and evoking something. You can describe something and be quite clinical about it. To evoke it, you call it up in the reader. That's what writers do when they're good. It's one of the things writing can do. Then there's another thing, which is just as difficult, and just as honourable, and that is to be able to evoke joy. There are some people who do that very well, Carol Shields, for example. Some do rage. Others do a disjointed kind of melancholy.\" But what is it that makes a particular writer good at a particular emotion? Why is she so good at pain? \"We don't know it. If we did, we'd package it and sell it. You can never tell anybody else how to do it.\" </p> <p>Readers tend to assume that Atwood must have had some terrible pain in her life, to convey it so well in her work. This infuriates her. \"If you feel that there's the author and then the character, then the book is not working. People have a habit of identifying the author with the narrator, and you can't, obviously, be all of the narrators in all of your books, or else you'd be a very strange person indeed. I do it myself when I'm reading a book...atch myself saying, I wonder if that really happened to her, or, oh, I didn't know she'd had an affair. It's because we're human beings. And human beings are social animals and they form groups of people that they know, and when you read a novel you feel you know the narrator. You can catch yourself in the act, you know it's not real, but you do it anyway, because that's what humans do.\" </p> <p>It must also be to do with the fashion for biography, the gossip culture, the cult of personality: that knowing that a writer committed suicide, or couldn't have children, or hated his mother, colours our understanding of the work on its own. \"Sometimes it is,\" she says, \"but only if you're that kind of person.\" What kind? \"The kind,\" she says, slowly, \"who's interested in gossip to the exclusion of form.\" </p> <p>Of course, it looks stern on paper, but it's the way she tells them. She follows this comment with a tinkly little laugh. </p> <p>\"Let's put it this way,\" she says. \"Who knows which daffodils Wordsworth wrote his poem about? Perhaps there weren't any daffodils. But who cares? What does it matter? All kinds of people have all kinds of really, really interesting things happen to them, and they don't write books about them. And all kinds of other people sit there in their rooms and you can't tell if it's real, you the reader can never actually know. A reader can never tell if it's a real thimble or an imaginary thimble, because by the time you're reading it, they're the same. It's a thimble. It's in the book.\" </p> <p>The Blind Assassin tackles this head on, asking the reader to work out how much of the novel within the novel is really fiction. It's a brilliant example of an author in control of her readers, as if she's saying: you think you understand, but do you? Really? Are you sure this isn't all just made-up? She's playing with our assumptions about who is the author, who is the narrator. It makes her angry when readers try to look for psychodramas in her background to explain the intensity of her books.</p> <p>\"The darkness is really out there,\" she says. \"It's not something that's in my head, just. It's in my work because it's in the world.\" Of course, she says, there must be some hook-in to something deeply personal if the book is going to work as art; but fiction is never the whole and literal truth. \"Take the Bront\u00ebs,\" she says. \"Was there really a Heathcliff? I doubt it very much. Maybe there was a proto-Heathcliff, or someone like Heathcliff, or someone glimpsed on a street corner one day. The passion was there, but it probably wasn't lived out in the way of their books. If you did, you probably wouldn't bother writing.\" </p> <p>This is quite a confession; confirmation - if any were needed - that writers don't have exciting lives, that her life isn't as eventful as her novels. But then, this is not much of a surprise. All reports of Atwood point to a full and happy personal life. Her parents liked each other; her father was an entomologist who studied forest insects, so she spent many of her early years learning how to live in the Canadian bush.</p> <p>At school a teacher said she showed \"no particular promise\", but it didn't matter: she loved books, Grimm, Poe, then Austen, then reading her own poems at a Toronto cafe called The Bohemian Embassy. Her father died of a stroke, but her mother is still alive at 92. She has a daughter, Jess, aged 24, who is a student of art history and who loves her mother's books. When she was 27, Atwood married James Polk, an American writer with a \"very entrancing mind\", but it lasted less than five years; she has lived, for the 28 years since, with fellow writer and fellow Canadian Graeme Gibson. </p> <p>Now then, Graeme Gibson. These are two people who fit well together. Graeme is a very tall, very big man with a huge white beard, a little yellow at the edges. He writes novels, which are moderately successful in Canada. He founded the Writer's Union, and the Canadian chapter of PEN, which fights for writers' human rights. He used to run bird-watching tours to Cuba. And this man exudes, bursts, beams with pride for his wife. </p> <p>While we're having lunch - we all drink ros\u00e9 in the sunshine - he tells a story about something that happened in Argentina. There was a reviewer on a live literary TV programme, completely trashing a woman writer's novel. It's garbage, says the reviewer - it's the biggest pile of garbage I've ever read. Anyway, the writer's husband was watching this live show at home. And he's furious, he's so furious that he gets into his car and drives to the studio and \"beats the shit\" out of the critic. \" 'Way to go!' That's what we were all saying!\" exclaims Graeme, laughing and punching the air. </p> <p>He would, of course, do exactly the same. </p> <p>Atwood herself is more relaxed when he's around, happy to let him be gregarious while she shields herself from the glare with her big floppy hat. She's always saying, \"Where's Graeme?\" or \"We must wait for Graeme.\" A British interviewer, quoting an American female novelist, once said \"every woman writer should be married to Graeme Gibson\". What did Atwood think of that? \"Oh, that was cute,\" she smiles. \"We got that put on to a T-shirt for him, in fact.\" </p> <p>This small intimacy is a little bit of Peggy coming out. Atwood was named Margaret, after her mother, but to avoid confusion she has always been known as Peggy to those close to her. (Torontonians don't ask whether or not you know Margaret Atwood; they ask whether you call her Margaret or Peggy.) It is Margaret who is usually on show in interviews - official, rather above it all, broadening everything out from the personal to the general. Why does she avoid getting personal in public? </p> <p>\"Oh, I can talk about all kinds of personal things, but they probably won't have anything to do with the book. It's the same as everyone else. It's factoid trivia. Am...erfectionist? No. Do I spend hours playing with my nails? No. But once in a while I file them so that they're even and sometimes I paint them, but I never bite them.\" But she goes out of her way to give interviewers nothing of herself. \"What do you mean, nothing?\" she says. \"There are some things that are not anyone else's business. You'd have to be quite strange to sit down and tell somebody everything about your entire life.\" People do. \"No they don't. They're giving you a facsimile of what you think is all about their life.\" </p> <p>Here it is, her double: the public and private personas, the real and unreal identities. The cold versus warm, the scary versus the approachable, the chilly reputation versus the personal guided tours of her Toronto. Margaret versus Peggy. \"I have a frivolous side,\" she once said, \"but you notice which name I use for writing. In a way, I had an alternate personality in reserve.\" Neither is her completely; she is both. </p> <p> And this is true of her narratives, too. In The Blind Assassin, Iris says of her sister, \"Laura was my left hand, and I was hers.\" In Alias Grace, her 1996 novel, the central character, a murderer called Grace, has amnesiac fits during which, she claims, she cannot be responsible for her actions. It was during one such episode that she committed her crime. Or did she? Nothing is easier to fake than amnesia. What is real, what is true? Atwood never tells us whether Grace has a split personality or is a very good liar - and who knows if the narrator is a reliable one? Zenia, in 1993's The Robber Bride, is both charming and evil; seductive and dangerous. And all these alternate personalities fit neatly with a comment Atwood once made that \"the national mental illness of Canada was schizophrenia\" - bilingual, always threatening to split in two. </p> <p>But Atwood does not agree that this is a feature peculiar to her work - partly, surely, because she pulls away from specific comments about her books in favour of broader comments about being \"human\" and hates to have her work categorised. (Asked the difference between her short stories and her novels, she said, \"short stories are short. Novels are long\".)</p> <p>\"Duality particularly interests fiction as a form,\" she says. \"It is particularly interesting from the word go - by which I mean Cain and Abel, Romulus and Remus. It's the structures of siblings. Look at Christianity - having had God, they had to have the Devil. I think it's the structure of the body and the brain. Two hands, two eyes, two halves of the brain - but one heart. This has been something that has interested people writing about being human. If we were millipedes, had a thousand legs and compound eyes, we'd write quite different books.\" </p> <p>Zenia, one of her most memorable characters, finds a way of hurting her closest women friends in horrific, emotionally devastating ways, exploiting their gravest fears, accessing them through their vulnerabilities. In Atwood's 1988 novel Cat's Eye, in childhood, Elaine's girlfriends, led by Cordelia, turn on her in terrifying ways that will affect her forever. Your friend is your enemy, your enemy your friend - and women, as they have always appeared in Atwood's novels, can be both.</p> <p>\"In real life, the best friend can be the worst enemy, because she can turn on you, ruin your life, steal your man,\" she says. \"It is life. There are mean girls. I think there was a period of time in the 70s when you weren't supposed to say that, when you were supposed to polarise things so that bad behaviour came from men. And even if some bad behaviour did come from women, then it was the fault of the patriarchy, and if the patriarchy wasn't there then all women would be nice. Well, I don't happen to believe that. There are all kinds of things that people do - and people do them, not boys or girls, even though they might do things in different ways. It's all about their struggles for power, survival, a position, self-definition. Chimpanzees do the same thing.\" </p> <p>Of course, the idea that women can be bad, and that women authors can write about bad women without betraying their sex, is commonplace now, and there are a great many serious women writers today, especially in Canada: it is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have been 29 in 1969, having published The Edible Woman, a feminist novel written before women's liberation kicked in, and have had interviewers ask you, \"Do men find you attractive?\" as one did. (Her reply, although she now denies it, was recorded as, \"Do women find you attractive? Because I don't.\")</p> <p>\"At that stage, you really were seen as a freak,\" she says. \"It was still the cusp of the women's movement. Reviews of The Edible Woman divided into people who hadn't caught up with the early women's movement and said this is a novel by a very young woman and she'll get more material later, and those who said this is cutting-edge feminism. Well, actually, it was not quite either one.\" </p> <p>This is an important point. Atwood is absolutely a feminist - many years of standing up for equality, supporting women workers, writing letters, protesting, testify to that. But that her books are feminist has sometimes been questioned - mainly because it is women who are evil in her fiction, not men. It could be argued, however, that her work is feminist in a much less literal and more mature sense, in that it features women who are good and bad, neat and messy; normal, damaged, whole, human. </p> <p>\"The idea of a female person writing - in fact, doing anything other than the traditional roles - it was very early days for that,\" she says. \"You were really seen as someone who was quite eccentric and peculiar.\" </p> <p>This was especially true in Canada. \"You have to take into account the colonial factor - Australians talk about having had \"cultural cringe\", because things come from elsewhere. The arts were very marginal then. Then, in the late 60s, you get this sudden upsurge, with all these people getting all this attention and getting into all the newspapers, and what are you going to say about them? What they usually said was: aren't they weird? It almost cancelled out the female weird - arty weird. </p> <p>\"In my early days of being interviewed on the radio, I'd get people saying, 'Why should I read your book?' or, 'Tell me in 25 words or less: what's the plot?' Or they'd kick off with, 'Haven't read your book, I'm not going to, but what's it about?' As far as they were concerned, I was just this jumped-up little shit. So of course they gave me a hard time. Things are quite pleasant for me these days, but what you see is the veteran of many battles.\" </p> <p>When Atwood said that she had a frivolous side, she was talking about Peggy, not Margaret, and I think I met both. We had a bit of fun, touring round Toronto. We ate a lot. She put on funny voices. When the photographer arrived, Atwood took off her hat, \"Because it looks stooooopid.\" She mimics a mad old lady: \" 'Who do you think you are, Greta Garbo?' \" There might even have been some jokes about strippers. She let me a little into the world of Peggy, a world Margaret-readers don't often get to see. </p> <p>But not that much. Even though I had all these personal experiences with Atwood - experiences that Canadian journalists I spoke to could hardly believe, said were unprecedented, totally out of character... I still didn't get that close to knowing who she is. She is so very good at the mirrors behind the mirrors. Perhaps there's a Margaret, for the world; a Peggy, for her friends (and the odd privileged acquaintance); and then a Pegs, the secret, private bit of her who only a few get to know. </p> <p>This is, of course, a very, very smart thing. Because, perhaps, if people knew her as Peggy or Pegs they wouldn't believe her books in the same way. Wouldn't knowing about her happy life spoil our understanding of Zenia's evil, of Cordelia's viciousness? If we knew the intricacies of her day-to-day domestic life with St Graeme, the garden, the cat, surely we would find it more difficult to be convinced by the emotional violence in her work? </p> <p>She does want us to know that her life isn't completely as painful as the novels. (She once said, \"Women see me as living proof that you don't have to come to a sticky end - put your head in an oven, stay silent for 30 years, not have children - to be a good and serious writer.\") And perhaps there is a deep, dark secret of some terrible pain that informs her most horrifying creations. But I doubt it. </p> <p>Instead, she plays up to the scary identity that has been constructed for and by her, in order to maintain Peggy's privacy. She likes her doubles: \"Everything has a positive space and a negative space. So there's you. And then there's the space that would be there if you weren't.\" She says, \"People shouldn't talk too much with authors, or they destroy their image of the writing.\" She has also said that \"self-definition is a kind of prison\".</p> <p>Atwood's life's work, for 30 years, has been about playing with reality, and she can take you to places you'd rather not go, in ways that few writers are able. She plays with reality in her fiction; she does it with her public persona, too. Why shouldn't Margaret Atwood, world-famous novelist, Canadian institution, be as much a construct as her heroines, her anti-heroines? The wry, deadpan humour belongs to both Peggy and Margaret, but Peggy keeps a lot in reserve for those she loves. </p> <p>So we're back to what's real and what's not. Atwood says that the Margaret who's the \"person on the big billboard... is sort of like having a twin who looks exactly like you, who is running around out of control. A lot of it is mythology.\" She doesn't want you to read her through her books, but she doesn't want you to read her through her interviews, either. She doesn't really want you to read her at all. What have you been doing reading this interview? Read her books instead.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Margaret Atwood would like to clear a few things up from the start. She is not a murderer (this in spite of writing as a murderer in Alias Grace). She was not bullied to within an inch of her existence by her childhood best friend (unlike the narrator of Cat's Eye). She is not a femme fatale about to steal your man (The Robber Bride), she does not have an eating disorder (The Edible Woman), and she is not a woman whose lover committed suicide (Life Before Man), nor a woman searching for her lost father (Surfacing). People often think she lives the lives of the characters in her books, she says. But they are not her. This is the message of her new novel, too, which could almost be read as a plea not to confuse the author with the narrator. In The Blind Assassin we have two narrators: Iris, 82 and looking back over her life, and Laura, her sister, author of a pulpy romance bestseller. Iris's story is a bitter one, a loveless tale of abusive marriage, bad loyalties and dissatisfaction. By contrast, Laura's novel within the novel is the tale of a scandalous love affair between a 30s lady in mink and a sexy young Bolshevik. But as time passes, the reader starts to wonder if Laura really did write the novel, and if the extraordinary events in it really did happen to her. What if it were someone else who caused the scandal? Are we right in believing that whoever wrote the novel must have had such experiences in real life? Where did we get the idea that the author is the star of their own fiction? It is also, perhaps, the message of our meeting. All we know and read about Margaret Atwood is that she is \"frosty\" and \"scary\" and \"witch-like\" and \"remote\". She's the \"high priestess of pain\". She's the \"authority on malevolence\". She's Medusa, Boudicca and the Queen Bee. Canadians, who know her better than anyone, warn that she's a ferocious interviewee: if she says you can have an hour, you'll get spot-on 60 minutes. She'll fight you, ridicule you, chew you up and spit you out and make you sorry you came. One writer ended an interview saying that if she ever saw her again, she'd run in the opposite direction. But when we meet on a sticky Toronto midsummer day, Atwood keeps suggesting more things we can do together, kindness after kindness. We go for breakfast, in her favourite cafe. And then lunch, with her husband (more of him later). A hotel for coffee and fruit and meringues. She takes me to her home, her garden. (It doesn't get much light, but has a gargoyle fountain and 10 lilies upright in a circle, tied to sticks, soldiers with rods down their backs.) She becomes my tour guide for Toronto (\"This is where I went to college; this is our legislature\"); she takes me on a tour of locations in her novels (the bridge Laura Chase drives off in The Blind Assassin; the bridge from which Elaine is led down an icy, dark and terrifying ravine in Cat's Eye; a street Roz crosses in The Robber Bride); then, even, a mini-tour of where she used to live. Sometimes when she speaks she puts on the voice of a child; sometimes when she's standing and asking a question she bends one leg inwards, at the knee, like young girls do when they want something. A sweet sort of intimacy. Why do people find her scary? \"They confuse me with the characters in my books,\" she says. (Don't forget. She's not her narrators, and she's not as her image would have her. It's all about what's real and what's not.) It is impossible to overstate just how famous Margaret Atwood is in Canada. For many years, before Jim Carrey and Shania Twain, Atwood was pretty much the only Canadian with international fame. When she started writing, there was no literary tradition; one year in the early 60s, only five Canadian novels were published. (In 1972, Atwood tried to draw some themes and conclusions about the limited number of writers in Canada's history in her extraordinary book of literary criticism, Survival.) But the fallow was fertile for her. \"I didn't feel all those genius men hanging over me,\" she says. \"Canada was a wide open prairie.\" Today, there's a fiction boom - Michael Ondaatje, Carol Shields, Alice Munro - and Atwood has been at the heart of it since The Edible Woman, her first novel, was published in 1969. (She had written it four years earlier, but the publisher lost the manuscript.) Her work since has been a roll call of gleaming successes, novels at once intellectual and popular, emotional and neatly- plotted: from Surfacing, her 1979 novel about a woman's investigation into her father's disappearance on a remote island, which has an emotional impact on all who read it; to the million-selling The Handmaid's Tale, perhaps her greatest work and certainly a classic, a feminist sci-fi horror story in which fertile women are turned into breeding machines; to Cat's Eye, the best novel ever written about how girls can bully each other. Three of her books - The Handmaid's Tale, Cat's Eye and Alias Grace - have been nominated for the Booker Prize. After 30 years at her craft, Atwood's new novel is a work by a writer who knows how to command an audience; getting out of her grasp, once you are in it, is not really an option. Readers develop quite obsessive relationships with her work. She's popular with women (her novels actually feature female characters you can believe in), but also men (she says she gets a large amount of fan mail from British men, who write to say they wish they'd read her books before their divorces - it might have saved their marriages). Atwood is taught in more than three-quarters of British universities. She's an industry on her own: The Blind Assassin is her 10th novel, her 37th book (she also writes poetry, children's books, literary criticism); she is published in more than 30 languages; even her assistant has an assistant. When it comes to book-signing, she has developed a system whereby an assistant passes the book or poster over to her, rather than reaching out. This was because of RSI problems. Yes: Atwood had been getting RSI not from typing, but from signing too many autographs. She arrives for breakfast wearing dark, loose clothing and a big, dark hat that shadows her face. Her eyes are a pale and memorable blue, her skin translucent and unlined, a trait she shares with her 92-year-old mother. (\"Good bones.\") She is tiny. She was once described as \"not like other people\", and there's something in the description - her appearance is both everywoman and strangely ethereal, her voice both quiet and impossible to ignore. Her manner, too, is unusual. This is Atwood, early in our meeting, on Prince Charles: \"If he weren't the prince or the duke or whatever he is, he would be considered a valuable eccentric person going against the grain and speaking out. A sort of Bertrand Russell or Albert Schweitzer of the food chain... He is not properly valued as an objet . If he were in Japan, he'd be valued as some precious, lacquered treasure.\" Her conversation is wry, educated, knowing; a bit superior, challenging you to get the joke. Later, when we're eating a fruit plate and I question the identity of an unfamiliar berry, she says it's a \"boobleberry\". I don't realise that she is making it up, using a little ridicule, at which her eyes glitter: \"We're going to have fun with you.\" (She once said that her humour was just like everyone else's in Atlantic Canada - deadpan. \"They'll tell you the most outrageous lies with a straight face.\") We order - or, rather, she does. \"I would like a freshly squeezed orange juice,\" she drawls, turning to me, \"and so would you.\" (I quickly nod) \"Then I would like a cappuccino,\" she turns to me, \"and so would you.\" (I nod again) \"And then I would like a toasted bagel,\" she turns to me, \"and so would you.\" This time, I shake my head, say no to the bagel. She looks perplexed, and rather thrilled, as if it were rare and fascinating for someone to say no to her. She opens up her grasp, and there's a handful of vitamins. \"Chewable betacarotene. Evening primrose,\" she says, counting them off. \"Glucose amine sulphates, which are good when you start getting a bit arthritic. Remember that. This is a very good kind of calcium, because it's in a gel cap. This is something I can't remember. This is vitamin C. This is a new kind of vitamin E which is supposed to be good for people who have cholesterol, which I have. Life is not fair. This is a ginger pill, which is on general principles. And these -\" she points to the biggest tablets, flecked with purple - \"are an Indian 'erb called Goo Goo lipids, which are supposed to be good for cholesterol.\" (Don't go searching for these. I'm pretty sure she made them up.) So it's the tablets that explain her youthful appearance? \"Actually, I'm 2,000 years old,\" she says. \"And dead.\" That Atlantic sense of humour again. Actually, at 60, she does not smoke, drinks in moderation (\"I drink just exactly the amount they say you're supposed to drink to avoid bursting, or whatever\"') and has never been out in the sun. She has facials, eats well, takes all those pills. It's not magic that makes her look so good: she's in control of what might harm her, takes steps to avoid the possibility of pain. It might be good advice to do something similar before you read an Atwood novel. She is a writer who revels in suffering, who describes pain so that it hurts, so that the reader feels it. One night, after reading The Robber Bride, I was awake until dawn, so deeply upsetting was her portrayal of Charis, who changed her name from Karen to try to obliterate the horrors of an abusive childhood. When, in Toronto, Atwood drove me to the bridge featured in Cat's Eye, the location of a hugely distressing incident of childhood torture in the novel, it was an overwhelming experience...ad to turn back and leave, as if from bad memories. In a way, I suppose I'd been there before - through her fiction, she'd already taken me. So what about this \"high priestess of pain\" label? \"I'm not responsible for other people's metaphors,\" she says. \"What that means is that I'm good at describing certain kinds of emotions. That's all it means. I also can do other things. I'm good at writing fake newspaper reports. High priestess of fake newspaper reports.\" But she describes pain so that it's unbearable, which is a shock when we think we see pain every day on television, news and dramas and chat shows and Oprah. \"There's a difference between describing and evoking something. You can describe something and be quite clinical about it. To evoke it, you call it up in the reader. That's what writers do when they're good. It's one of the things writing can do. Then there's another thing, which is just as difficult, and just as honourable, and that is to be able to evoke joy. There are some people who do that very well, Carol Shields, for example. Some do rage. Others do a disjointed kind of melancholy.\" But what is it that makes a particular writer good at a particular emotion? Why is she so good at pain? \"We don't know it. If we did, we'd package it and sell it. You can never tell anybody else how to do it.\" Readers tend to assume that Atwood must have had some terrible pain in her life, to convey it so well in her work. This infuriates her. \"If you feel that there's the author and then the character, then the book is not working. People have a habit of identifying the author with the narrator, and you can't, obviously, be all of the narrators in all of your books, or else you'd be a very strange person indeed. I do it myself when I'm reading a book...atch myself saying, I wonder if that really happened to her, or, oh, I didn't know she'd had an affair. It's because we're human beings. And human beings are social animals and they form groups of people that they know, and when you read a novel you feel you know the narrator. You can catch yourself in the act, you know it's not real, but you do it anyway, because that's what humans do.\" It must also be to do with the fashion for biography, the gossip culture, the cult of personality: that knowing that a writer committed suicide, or couldn't have children, or hated his mother, colours our understanding of the work on its own. \"Sometimes it is,\" she says, \"but only if you're that kind of person.\" What kind? \"The kind,\" she says, slowly, \"who's interested in gossip to the exclusion of form.\" Of course, it looks stern on paper, but it's the way she tells them. She follows this comment with a tinkly little laugh. \"Let's put it this way,\" she says. \"Who knows which daffodils Wordsworth wrote his poem about? Perhaps there weren't any daffodils. But who cares? What does it matter? All kinds of people have all kinds of really, really interesting things happen to them, and they don't write books about them. And all kinds of other people sit there in their rooms and you can't tell if it's real, you the reader can never actually know. A reader can never tell if it's a real thimble or an imaginary thimble, because by the time you're reading it, they're the same. It's a thimble. It's in the book.\" The Blind Assassin tackles this head on, asking the reader to work out how much of the novel within the novel is really fiction. It's a brilliant example of an author in control of her readers, as if she's saying: you think you understand, but do you? Really? Are you sure this isn't all just made-up? She's playing with our assumptions about who is the author, who is the narrator. It makes her angry when readers try to look for psychodramas in her background to explain the intensity of her books. \"The darkness is really out there,\" she says. \"It's not something that's in my head, just. It's in my work because it's in the world.\" Of course, she says, there must be some hook-in to something deeply personal if the book is going to work as art; but fiction is never the whole and literal truth. \"Take the Bront\u00ebs,\" she says. \"Was there really a Heathcliff? I doubt it very much. Maybe there was a proto-Heathcliff, or someone like Heathcliff, or someone glimpsed on a street corner one day. The passion was there, but it probably wasn't lived out in the way of their books. If you did, you probably wouldn't bother writing.\" This is quite a confession; confirmation - if any were needed - that writers don't have exciting lives, that her life isn't as eventful as her novels. But then, this is not much of a surprise. All reports of Atwood point to a full and happy personal life. Her parents liked each other; her father was an entomologist who studied forest insects, so she spent many of her early years learning how to live in the Canadian bush. At school a teacher said she showed \"no particular promise\", but it didn't matter: she loved books, Grimm, Poe, then Austen, then reading her own poems at a Toronto cafe called The Bohemian Embassy. Her father died of a stroke, but her mother is still alive at 92. She has a daughter, Jess, aged 24, who is a student of art history and who loves her mother's books. When she was 27, Atwood married James Polk, an American writer with a \"very entrancing mind\", but it lasted less than five years; she has lived, for the 28 years since, with fellow writer and fellow Canadian Graeme Gibson. Now then, Graeme Gibson. These are two people who fit well together. Graeme is a very tall, very big man with a huge white beard, a little yellow at the edges. He writes novels, which are moderately successful in Canada. He founded the Writer's Union, and the Canadian chapter of PEN, which fights for writers' human rights. He used to run bird-watching tours to Cuba. And this man exudes, bursts, beams with pride for his wife. While we're having lunch - we all drink ros\u00e9 in the sunshine - he tells a story about something that happened in Argentina. There was a reviewer on a live literary TV programme, completely trashing a woman writer's novel. It's garbage, says the reviewer - it's the biggest pile of garbage I've ever read. Anyway, the writer's husband was watching this live show at home. And he's furious, he's so furious that he gets into his car and drives to the studio and \"beats the shit\" out of the critic. \" 'Way to go!' That's what we were all saying!\" exclaims Graeme, laughing and punching the air. He would, of course, do exactly the same. Atwood herself is more relaxed when he's around, happy to let him be gregarious while she shields herself from the glare with her big floppy hat. She's always saying, \"Where's Graeme?\" or \"We must wait for Graeme.\" A British interviewer, quoting an American female novelist, once said \"every woman writer should be married to Graeme Gibson\". What did Atwood think of that? \"Oh, that was cute,\" she smiles. \"We got that put on to a T-shirt for him, in fact.\" This small intimacy is a little bit of Peggy coming out. Atwood was named Margaret, after her mother, but to avoid confusion she has always been known as Peggy to those close to her. (Torontonians don't ask whether or not you know Margaret Atwood; they ask whether you call her Margaret or Peggy.) It is Margaret who is usually on show in interviews - official, rather above it all, broadening everything out from the personal to the general. Why does she avoid getting personal in public? \"Oh, I can talk about all kinds of personal things, but they probably won't have anything to do with the book. It's the same as everyone else. It's factoid trivia. Am...erfectionist? No. Do I spend hours playing with my nails? No. But once in a while I file them so that they're even and sometimes I paint them, but I never bite them.\" But she goes out of her way to give interviewers nothing of herself. \"What do you mean, nothing?\" she says. \"There are some things that are not anyone else's business. You'd have to be quite strange to sit down and tell somebody everything about your entire life.\" People do. \"No they don't. They're giving you a facsimile of what you think is all about their life.\" Here it is, her double: the public and private personas, the real and unreal identities. The cold versus warm, the scary versus the approachable, the chilly reputation versus the personal guided tours of her Toronto. Margaret versus Peggy. \"I have a frivolous side,\" she once said, \"but you notice which name I use for writing. In a way, I had an alternate personality in reserve.\" Neither is her completely; she is both. And this is true of her narratives, too. In The Blind Assassin, Iris says of her sister, \"Laura was my left hand, and I was hers.\" In Alias Grace, her 1996 novel, the central character, a murderer called Grace, has amnesiac fits during which, she claims, she cannot be responsible for her actions. It was during one such episode that she committed her crime. Or did she? Nothing is easier to fake than amnesia. What is real, what is true? Atwood never tells us whether Grace has a split personality or is a very good liar - and who knows if the narrator is a reliable one? Zenia, in 1993's The Robber Bride, is both charming and evil; seductive and dangerous. And all these alternate personalities fit neatly with a comment Atwood once made that \"the national mental illness of Canada was schizophrenia\" - bilingual, always threatening to split in two. But Atwood does not agree that this is a feature peculiar to her work - partly, surely, because she pulls away from specific comments about her books in favour of broader comments about being \"human\" and hates to have her work categorised. (Asked the difference between her short stories and her novels, she said, \"short stories are short. Novels are long\".) \"Duality particularly interests fiction as a form,\" she says. \"It is particularly interesting from the word go - by which I mean Cain and Abel, Romulus and Remus. It's the structures of siblings. Look at Christianity - having had God, they had to have the Devil. I think it's the structure of the body and the brain. Two hands, two eyes, two halves of the brain - but one heart. This has been something that has interested people writing about being human. If we were millipedes, had a thousand legs and compound eyes, we'd write quite different books.\" Zenia, one of her most memorable characters, finds a way of hurting her closest women friends in horrific, emotionally devastating ways, exploiting their gravest fears, accessing them through their vulnerabilities. In Atwood's 1988 novel Cat's Eye, in childhood, Elaine's girlfriends, led by Cordelia, turn on her in terrifying ways that will affect her forever. Your friend is your enemy, your enemy your friend - and women, as they have always appeared in Atwood's novels, can be both. \"In real life, the best friend can be the worst enemy, because she can turn on you, ruin your life, steal your man,\" she says. \"It is life. There are mean girls. I think there was a period of time in the 70s when you weren't supposed to say that, when you were supposed to polarise things so that bad behaviour came from men. And even if some bad behaviour did come from women, then it was the fault of the patriarchy, and if the patriarchy wasn't there then all women would be nice. Well, I don't happen to believe that. There are all kinds of things that people do - and people do them, not boys or girls, even though they might do things in different ways. It's all about their struggles for power, survival, a position, self-definition. Chimpanzees do the same thing.\" Of course, the idea that women can be bad, and that women authors can write about bad women without betraying their sex, is commonplace now, and there are a great many serious women writers today, especially in Canada: it is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have been 29 in 1969, having published The Edible Woman, a feminist novel written before women's liberation kicked in, and have had interviewers ask you, \"Do men find you attractive?\" as one did. (Her reply, although she now denies it, was recorded as, \"Do women find you attractive? Because I don't.\") \"At that stage, you really were seen as a freak,\" she says. \"It was still the cusp of the women's movement. Reviews of The Edible Woman divided into people who hadn't caught up with the early women's movement and said this is a novel by a very young woman and she'll get more material later, and those who said this is cutting-edge feminism. Well, actually, it was not quite either one.\" This is an important point. Atwood is absolutely a feminist - many years of standing up for equality, supporting women workers, writing letters, protesting, testify to that. But that her books are feminist has sometimes been questioned - mainly because it is women who are evil in her fiction, not men. It could be argued, however, that her work is feminist in a much less literal and more mature sense, in that it features women who are good and bad, neat and messy; normal, damaged, whole, human. \"The idea of a female person writing - in fact, doing anything other than the traditional roles - it was very early days for that,\" she says. \"You were really seen as someone who was quite eccentric and peculiar.\" This was especially true in Canada. \"You have to take into account the colonial factor - Australians talk about having had \"cultural cringe\", because things come from elsewhere. The arts were very marginal then. Then, in the late 60s, you get this sudden upsurge, with all these people getting all this attention and getting into all the newspapers, and what are you going to say about them? What they usually said was: aren't they weird? It almost cancelled out the female weird - arty weird. \"In my early days of being interviewed on the radio, I'd get people saying, 'Why should I read your book?' or, 'Tell me in 25 words or less: what's the plot?' Or they'd kick off with, 'Haven't read your book, I'm not going to, but what's it about?' As far as they were concerned, I was just this jumped-up little shit. So of course they gave me a hard time. Things are quite pleasant for me these days, but what you see is the veteran of many battles.\" When Atwood said that she had a frivolous side, she was talking about Peggy, not Margaret, and I think I met both. We had a bit of fun, touring round Toronto. We ate a lot. She put on funny voices. When the photographer arrived, Atwood took off her hat, \"Because it looks stooooopid.\" She mimics a mad old lady: \" 'Who do you think you are, Greta Garbo?' \" There might even have been some jokes about strippers. She let me a little into the world of Peggy, a world Margaret-readers don't often get to see. But not that much. Even though I had all these personal experiences with Atwood - experiences that Canadian journalists I spoke to could hardly believe, said were unprecedented, totally out of character... I still didn't get that close to knowing who she is. She is so very good at the mirrors behind the mirrors. Perhaps there's a Margaret, for the world; a Peggy, for her friends (and the odd privileged acquaintance); and then a Pegs, the secret, private bit of her who only a few get to know. This is, of course, a very, very smart thing. Because, perhaps, if people knew her as Peggy or Pegs they wouldn't believe her books in the same way. Wouldn't knowing about her happy life spoil our understanding of Zenia's evil, of Cordelia's viciousness? If we knew the intricacies of her day-to-day domestic life with St Graeme, the garden, the cat, surely we would find it more difficult to be convinced by the emotional violence in her work? She does want us to know that her life isn't completely as painful as the novels. (She once said, \"Women see me as living proof that you don't have to come to a sticky end - put your head in an oven, stay silent for 30 years, not have children - to be a good and serious writer.\") And perhaps there is a deep, dark secret of some terrible pain that informs her most horrifying creations. But I doubt it. Instead, she plays up to the scary identity that has been constructed for and by her, in order to maintain Peggy's privacy. She likes her doubles: \"Everything has a positive space and a negative space. So there's you. And then there's the space that would be there if you weren't.\" She says, \"People shouldn't talk too much with authors, or they destroy their image of the writing.\" She has also said that \"self-definition is a kind of prison\". Atwood's life's work, for 30 years, has been about playing with reality, and she can take you to places you'd rather not go, in ways that few writers are able. She plays with reality in her fiction; she does it with her public persona, too. Why shouldn't Margaret Atwood, world-famous novelist, Canadian institution, be as much a construct as her heroines, her anti-heroines? The wry, deadpan humour belongs to both Peggy and Margaret, but Peggy keeps a lot in reserve for those she loves. So we're back to what's real and what's not. Atwood says that the Margaret who's the \"person on the big billboard... is sort of like having a twin who looks exactly like you, who is running around out of control. A lot of it is mythology.\" She doesn't want you to read her through her books, but she doesn't want you to read her through her interviews, either. She doesn't really want you to read her at all. What have you been doing reading this interview? Read her books instead.",

      "body": "<p>Poor Sacha Distel. Not only did people hate him enough already for being one of the few men alive to have had full penetrative sex with the young Brigitte Bardot, but now he's in the merde with his fellow Frenchies for claiming last week that English is a far better language to sing in than French.</p> <p>Then the fantastically brilliant American-born writer Bonnie Greer revealed in last Saturday's Guardian that, when travelling back to her adopted homeland from the US, she habitually begs airlines to let her sit near the front of the plane, so that she may be all the quicker on to her beloved British soil.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the very sexy model and singer Caprice, who was born and bred in California, sighed to OK! magazine from her LA condo that she considers England to be her real home: \"Living there has made me a much better person, a lot more cultured and sophisticated... the education system is better, so you get a different kind of character.\" Gee whiz, Caprice! </p> <p>Knowing that I'm approved of by Sacha, Bonnie and the beauteous Miss Bourret makes me feel even better about the recent nasty comments from Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie and Jeanette Winterson about how they're planning to leg it to America because this country is going to the dogs - ie, not buying their rotten books in anything like the quantities they used to. Go on, be honest: which trio would you rather go down the pub with? I thought so. </p> <p>And, of course, once more it is naked self-interest attempting to cloak its dank and shameful crevices in the watered silk of artistic stimulation. As sumptuous banquets of hypocrisy go, it's the 80s Bad Boy actors thing all over again - you remember, when every week there would be an interview with Tim Roth or Gary Oldman ranting on about how they couldn't breathe any more in Thatcher's rotten, repressive, rightwing Britain. So, for the good of their health and their art, they were moving to... Cuba? Sweden? No, actually: they were moving to kind, enlightened, liberal Reagan's America!</p> <p>You couldn't help but snigger when the turkeys started trotting. Like Michael Caine before them, who made such gems as Alfie, The Ipcress File and Get Carter in boring old Britain before abandoning us for Hollywood where, apparently, the real work was - in his case Blame It On Rio, Jaws: The Revenge and The Swarm IV. </p> <p>No, when Brits move to America - be they actors, writers or stupid sportsmen-turned- movie-tough-guys with mouths like little cats' anuses who are managing to pass off silence as wisdom rather than cretinism - they move there for one of two reasons, both of which have nothing to do with art. They move there because they are rich and greedy for more, or because, unconsciously, they worship evil.</p> <p>Yes, I said evil. You need only read or own dear George Monbiot's excellent new book to understand that the US has done, is doing and will do more damage to this planet and its people than Nazi Germany and fascist Japan put together. In the face of this, the rest of the world seems somehow to have reverted to the state of impressionable native - and instead of waving shiny beads in our faces, the Americans now wave shiny Starbucks, Seinfeld and Britney Spears instead. </p> <p>And this voodoo works. All around you, you can hear people choosing to ignore the fact that America is greatly responsible for turning the earth into an open sewer - culturally, morally and physically - and harping on instead about American \"energy\" and \"can-do\". Of course, nine times out of 10, that energy is the energy of the vandal, psychotic or manic depressive, fuelling acts of barbarism and destruction from My Lai to Eminem; and it's a shame that that legendary can-do usually translates as can-do crime, can-do imperialism and can-do poisoning the seas. But Frasier's dead funny, so never mind! </p> <p>If you want to worship evil and cosy up in the belly of the beast, you're perfectly free to do so, but please don't dress it up as love of art. The fact is that Britain has always attracted sexy, brilliant Americans such as Ava Gardner, Stanley Kubrick and numerous blacks who cannot believe the lack of racial segregation that exists here.</p> <p>You could see this in the true-life scene from John Schlesinger's film, Yanks, when the English girls, horrified by the white GIs' contempt for their black colleagues, grab the black men and drag them on to the dancefloor, leaving the white Americans as wallflowers. When I was in the music business, I was always being told by black musicians how amazed they were by the sexual and social freedom extended to them here.

      "bodyText": "Poor Sacha Distel. Not only did people hate him enough already for being one of the few men alive to have had full penetrative sex with the young Brigitte Bardot, but now he's in the merde with his fellow Frenchies for claiming last week that English is a far better language to sing in than French. Then the fantastically brilliant American-born writer Bonnie Greer revealed in last Saturday's Guardian that, when travelling back to her adopted homeland from the US, she habitually begs airlines to let her sit near the front of the plane, so that she may be all the quicker on to her beloved British soil. Meanwhile, the very sexy model and singer Caprice, who was born and bred in California, sighed to OK! magazine from her LA condo that she considers England to be her real home: \"Living there has made me a much better person, a lot more cultured and sophisticated... the education system is better, so you get a different kind of character.\" Gee whiz, Caprice! Knowing that I'm approved of by Sacha, Bonnie and the beauteous Miss Bourret makes me feel even better about the recent nasty comments from Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie and Jeanette Winterson about how they're planning to leg it to America because this country is going to the dogs - ie, not buying their rotten books in anything like the quantities they used to. Go on, be honest: which trio would you rather go down the pub with? I thought so. And, of course, once more it is naked self-interest attempting to cloak its dank and shameful crevices in the watered silk of artistic stimulation. As sumptuous banquets of hypocrisy go, it's the 80s Bad Boy actors thing all over again - you remember, when every week there would be an interview with Tim Roth or Gary Oldman ranting on about how they couldn't breathe any more in Thatcher's rotten, repressive, rightwing Britain. So, for the good of their health and their art, they were moving to... Cuba? Sweden? No, actually: they were moving to kind, enlightened, liberal Reagan's America! You couldn't help but snigger when the turkeys started trotting. Like Michael Caine before them, who made such gems as Alfie, The Ipcress File and Get Carter in boring old Britain before abandoning us for Hollywood where, apparently, the real work was - in his case Blame It On Rio, Jaws: The Revenge and The Swarm IV. No, when Brits move to America - be they actors, writers or stupid sportsmen-turned- movie-tough-guys with mouths like little cats' anuses who are managing to pass off silence as wisdom rather than cretinism - they move there for one of two reasons, both of which have nothing to do with art. They move there because they are rich and greedy for more, or because, unconsciously, they worship evil. Yes, I said evil. You need only read or own dear George Monbiot's excellent new book to understand that the US has done, is doing and will do more damage to this planet and its people than Nazi Germany and fascist Japan put together. In the face of this, the rest of the world seems somehow to have reverted to the state of impressionable native - and instead of waving shiny beads in our faces, the Americans now wave shiny Starbucks, Seinfeld and Britney Spears instead. And this voodoo works. All around you, you can hear people choosing to ignore the fact that America is greatly responsible for turning the earth into an open sewer - culturally, morally and physically - and harping on instead about American \"energy\" and \"can-do\". Of course, nine times out of 10, that energy is the energy of the vandal, psychotic or manic depressive, fuelling acts of barbarism and destruction from My Lai to Eminem; and it's a shame that that legendary can-do usually translates as can-do crime, can-do imperialism and can-do poisoning the seas. But Frasier's dead funny, so never mind! If you want to worship evil and cosy up in the belly of the beast, you're perfectly free to do so, but please don't dress it up as love of art. The fact is that Britain has always attracted sexy, brilliant Americans such as Ava Gardner, Stanley Kubrick and numerous blacks who cannot believe the lack of racial segregation that exists here. You could see this in the true-life scene from John Schlesinger's film, Yanks, when the English girls, horrified by the white GIs' contempt for their black colleagues, grab the black men and drag them on to the dancefloor, leaving the white Americans as wallflowers. When I was in the music business, I was always being told by black musicians how amazed they were by the sexual and social freedom extended to them here. Most touchingly, I'll never forget a black teenager from a Boston boy band whispering to me, \"You can go anywhere you like in England! Where I come from, there's always someone telling you you can't come in.\" And every so often, you meet black Americans called Devon - never white ones: \"It's because my grandpa was there during the war,\" an American black lady told me recently. \"The people were so nice to him, he always dreamed of going back.

      "body": "<p>There were thousands of us. The crowd was bigger than that for Suzanne Vega. It was bigger even than that for the doyen of world music, Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour, even though we were at Womad, the annual festival of world music. No, this was the man we all wanted to see. We recognise his face instantly. We trust the square glasses, the ruthlessly trimmed beard. We know the words to every single one of his songs. \"You're a hero,\" cried out a white Rasta. The crowd began to shout his name. Can you tell who it is yet? \"Rolf, Rolf, Rolf, Rolf... \" </p> <p>Rolf Harris is wearing a T-shirt with a cartoon of Rolf Harris on it, drawn by Rolf Harris. He is entirely self-referential. He cannot be compared to any one else. Cartoonist, entertainer, raconteur, percussionist, singer, songwriter, painter, one-man world music machine, TV presenter and, aged 70, about to hit the club scene with a dance track. When he performed Fine Day, his first new single in five years, the crowd went wild. He could have done anything with them. </p> <p>He could have done anything with me. I had conned my way on to the stage wing with my seven-year-old daughter, to be closer to the man himself. He came over to us and shook my hand. I don't like to admit it, but I felt weak at the knees. I could barely bring myself to ask how old he was. \"Seventy,\" he said. I muttered some half-audible, \"No, surely, you can't possibly be.\" If Rolf Harris is old, I realised, then I must be getting that way, too. \"I'm fine, apart from this,\" he said, and waved the crutch he uses to help him get around. A knee operation has left him with a limp. \"Jake The Peg really has three legs!\" cheered my daughter. Within a moment of the meeting, we are both devoted to him. I was determined to see him again. </p> <p>So here I am, four weeks later, at an anonymous Heathrow hotel, interviewing Rolf. We are in the lounge... I don't need to describe it, they're all the same, you can envisage it exactly. I'll just give you one visual clue: the carpet was a mushy green, and patterned. Everything else was made of vinyl. </p> <p>This is how the interview began. \"Dee, dee, dagga dagga, dagga dagga, dagga dagga, brrr, buph, buph, buph, tip, tip,\" says Rolf. He hisses like a kettle whistling, when kettles used to whistle. Then he blows a raspberry. </p> <p>\"I love getting different sounds and working out different rhythms,\" he explains. \"I was listening to Radio 1 in the car, and they had one of those dance tracks without any voice at all, just going... \" and he starts off again, \"bumph, dee, bumph, dee, chuph, chuph, bumph, bumph, bumph, brrrrrrr. The drum machine going like mad, dee, dee, dagga dagga... All these synchronised drum sounds. I kept waiting for someone to say something, but there was no voice at all. And it just went on, it seemed like for an hour. Out of boredom, I was thinking, what sort of words? I'd heard some tracks before when guys had done very tongue-twisting lines. Digedde, gedde, geddddd. Something like that. I kept thinking what sort of words would work on a really fast thing? And I thought, wanna, wanna, wonna, winna... \" </p> <p>This is the start of the story of how Fine Day was conceived, probably the only dance track to be written and performed by a 70-year-old. Well past pensionable age, Rolf Harris has started to share a record label with De La Soul, Pimpadelic, Screwball, Coolio and Grammy winners Everlast. </p> <p>Perhaps I ought to explain a couple of things first, before you get the wrong impression about Rolf. He is not some reinvented 60s icon, a sad, ageing man with a limp who refuses to grow old, a Peter Stringfellow of the world music scene. When Rolf uses the word \"guys\", he is not being hip, he is being Australian, in an 80s, or even earlier sense. He says \"square\" as if he's just discovered the word, as in \"it was square to like Rolf Harris until I recorded Stairway To Heaven\". He still uses \"disco\" when he means \"dance\". He's wearing a turquoise shirt, a colour that is irretrievably associated with a decade that gave birth to the Bay City Rollers and the Arctic roll.</p> <p>Although we might now find Rolf fashionable, and we may cheer him at our festivals (he's played Womad, Glastonbury and Guildford this year), it's not Rolf that's changed. We have. He reminds us of when we were young, when children's TV had real-life stars and not cartoon characters as heroes. Rolf has not attempted to keep up with us. We have gone back to him. The song that received the biggest cheer at Womad was Two Little Boys, a sentimental ballad about the American Civil War that is hardly cutting edge, and that Rolf first sang in 1969. Margaret Thatcher chose it as one of her Desert Island Discs. </p> <p>The other point that it's important to make is that Rolf does not speak our language. It's not only that this man has introduced objects with ridiculous names - wobble-board, didgeridoo, Rolfaroo, Coojee Bear, Stylophone (which David Frost dubbed \"the world's smallest organ\") - into our everyday vocabulary, he speaks a tongue that is only partly made up of recognisable words. The rest is rhythm sounds - impossible to write down with any accuracy - which are usually inextricably linked to some arm movements, rather like the actions that accompany children's nursery songs. Alwen Hughes, Harris's wife for 42 years, bemoans, \"Rolf has always made weird noises.\" </p> <p>Only after a good 20 minutes of talking - if we can give that word to the sounds that emerge from Rolf's agile lips - does he sit back a moment and say, \"I don't know how you'd write that - wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna\", helpfully suggesting a few alternative spellings. He resumes his wah-wahing for another five minutes, until it changes from \"wanna wanna\" to \"wunna wanna\".</p> <p>This, explains Rolf, is \"wouldn't want to\" said extremely fast. A few minutes of wunna wanna follow, during which he gets so excited that he knocks off his big bifocals, before beginning to speak our language again. \"I was doing all these sounds, and I was going into a dinner with Peter Salmon, controller of BBC1. He laid on a meal for a few of the top BBC presenters. I was sitting next to one of the weather girls. Really good-looking blonde girl. I was talking to her about all the problems of her job, how they manage to refer to the screen when they only see it on a monitor... I was so impressed with it. We had a nice long conversation. Then, on the way home in the car, I put on Radio 1 again, trying to find another bit of rhythm, because I had this thing going in my head. That would work well, wouldn't it?\" I wonder what he's referring to, but he begins to sing, \"Another bit of rhythm, another bit, another bit... \" extremely fast, until it becomes, \"anna bi, anna bi, anna bi\"... </p> <p>\"I'm really keen on words that create a fascinating rhythm. I did a song about Pavlova, the dessert.\" This may read like a non sequitur, but when Rolf Harris says \"Pavlova\", it sounds like the percussion section of a pub band. Without being prompted, he sings me a line: \"Then he got out another meringue, a big one, then a banana... cut it up into a lot of bite-sized pieces.\" He sang these words faster than you can ever read them. He then started banging out a rhythm on the vinyl table. Anything will do as his drum. </p> <p>Then, without so much as a skipped breath, we're back to the story of the creation of Fine Day. \"Wouldn't want to worry what the weatherwoman told you... It just developed over the three quarters of an hour drive home to my place.\" These words, garbled so fast they are unrecognisable (\"wunna wanna worree wa wether... \"), became the lyrics. </p> <p>He makes no concession to the club scene, apart from his music. His brown leather shoes are splattered with paint, as if to give a hint of who he might be. But there is never any doubt. It would be impossible to disguise or alter him. I flicked through his books - The A-To-Z Of Animal Hospital, Draw Your Own Cartoons With Rolf Harris, Tall Animal Tales, True Animal Tales - and his 70th birthday tribute, The Court Of King Rolf. In every picture, he looks exactly the same. The same smile, the same bit of a chin, the same glasses, the same beard. He always seems a certain age, never 16 and certainly not 70. He has always been Rolf Harris, whether singing his version of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody or Two Little Boys. I came across one photograph, taken while he was in his 20s and had just arrived in England. He has tightly curled dark hair, no glasses, no beard. When I showed it to a friend of mine, she called it \"scary\". It was like coming across your granddad without any clothes on. </p> <p>Rolf Harris has always been nothing other than Rolf Harris. He was born that way. His mother gave him no other names. He was brought up, no doubt humming and whistling before he could even walk, in a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, by parents who had emigrated from Wales. Aged 15, he became Australian Junior Backstroke Champion. (Remember the TV safety campaign he later headed, imploring all us pommie kids to learn to swim?) He entered the national radio Australia's Amateur Hour with his very own version of Seven Beers With The Wrong Woman. (It now seems near impossible to imagine Harris singing a song with such a suggestive title.) It was voted the best performance, and he was offered a slot in a variety show at Her Majesty's Theatre, Perth. His stage career was launched. </p> <p>At 22, and clean-shaven for the last time, he came to Britain to study painting at the London Art School. \"The constant feeling I picked up from my parents was that England was the hub of the universe, that this part of the world was the centre of everything. They referred to it as Home, in inverted commas and with a capital H. I thought I had enough money to last me for life, but I ran out of money very soon in that first year. The money I had went... \" and he makes the sound of something being sucked down a Hoover. </p> <p>He continues the story: \"I'm now without any loot and I've got a job singing at an Australian club called the Down Under once a week. That netted me two and a half quid for three hours' work. I was doing portraits of people, in oils, for \u00a35 a time. I dropped out of art school because I got a job doing cabaret at the Gargoyle Club in the West End, at the piano, singing clever songs, boogie. I was getting home at three in the morning. And art school wasn't giving me what I wanted. Then I met up with a painter, Hayward Veal. I became a sort of disciple of his. This guy taught me all about impressionist painting. Then I got a job on children's television doing drawing and telling stories. Veal was the one who got me on the right road for doing all these huge paintings I did on television in the late 60s and into the 70s and 80s. I was just using a very strictly organised, simplified version of his impressionist painting.\" </p> <p>It's easy to imagine Harris's career being launched at an amateur competition; there is something about him that seems very unrehearsed. Whatever he's doing - whether playing his squeezebox or dashing off a Rolfaroo cartoon - it appears as if he is not professionally performing but simply doing his party piece. This is an illusion. On his first adult Saturday night TV series, The Rolf Harris Show, accompanied by the irreparably dated Young Generation dance troupe, he would draw huge landscapes on 12ft x 9ft backdrops. It looked effortless. But Harris would practise the paintings in full size as many as five times, against a stopwatch, so he could recreate them live in the allotted time each week. </p> <p>He's a man with fidgety hands and a very active mouth. They're always up to something. His new bride used to complain that he wrote songs on the menu at the Grill &amp; Cheese, a Lyons Corner House in Marble Arch to which he frequently took her. Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport is said to have been composed on the back of one such menu. He famously whistles while he executes his cartoons, interrupting only to shout, \"Can you tell what it is yet?\" (\"Can you tell what it is yet?\" has remained his catchphrase.)</p> <p>Somehow, he manages to eat his club sandwich while demonstrating how to play a Jew's harp. \"Val Doonican showed me how to play that properly - 20 years ago,\" he says. (I try to remember if Val Doonican is still alive.) He is a one-man band, and I am a one-woman audience, but at least I am an audience, and a very appreciative one. \"He is addicted to applause - that would be hard for him to give up,\" says Alwen. \"Rolf has had continuous praise all his life and has become accustomed to it.\" </p> <p>It is being appreciated that matters to him. It's no use pestering Rolf about the meaning of his work. There is nothing behind and beyond what you see. Questions that attempt to be penetrating, to extract meaning, are answered in exactly the same manner, as straightforward factual enquiries. Everything is turned into a story accompanied by a one-man rhythm section. There is only one level on which Rolf operates, and it is not deep. </p> <p>His appeal is primal. His songs reach parts other songs just don't reach. They nearly always involve repetition, to be comforting, and most (Jake The Peg, I've Lost My Mummy, Six White Boomers, Two Little Boys) are written from the viewpoint of a child. Being a child, of course, is a universal experience. We've all been there at some point; we all at some point long to return. But we can glimpse that lost place singing along with Rolf, who reminds us that we were once innocent, lovely little beings (\"little\" is a recurrent word in his lyrics) who liked to play and make up silly rhymes, just like he does. </p> <p>There must be a Mr Nasty somewhere inside that Mr Nice. There just must be. But try as I might, I couldn't find him. Rolf had just got off a nine and a half hour flight from Vancouver, and was leaving in a couple of hours to film the video for Fine Day in Cannes, with no time for even a shower between flights, yet it was me, a stranger, he was concerned about. \"Would you like some coffee?\" he asks, cupping my elbow in his palm. </p> <p>Perhaps his greatest crime is being anodyne. He is a bit too easy to like - not exactly a trait to be listed alongside the deadly sins. He is utterly inoffensive, with the single exception of having a reputation for telling right-off jokes, particularly about the Irish. I beg him to tell me one. \"There's a great one that really reflects that whole politically-correct thing,\" he says. \"But you can't really write it, because it depends on accent.\" In the scheme of things, conveying accent seemed a minor problem when I came to transcribe the tape. Harris claims he heard the joke from the comedian Barry Cryer. \"This Irish fella rings up the maternity ward at the hospital and asks if they've any news about his wife, who's in labour at the moment. The matron on the other end of the phone says, 'Is this her first child?' And he says, 'No, it's her husband.'\" The whole thing is told in a rather good Irish accent. Harris chuckles. </p> <p>\"Do you think you can laugh about practically anything?\" I ask him. His response is swift. \"No.... raw the line at filth and crude language. It seems to be an excuse for not being funny.\" I remembered that when he said the word \"bloody\" in front of the Womad crowd, I had been genuinely shocked. Rolf Harris just didn't speak like that. \"I've told some questionable jokes,\" he continues, \"which could be called dirty jokes, but with the proviso that they've got to be funny.\" I ask him to tell me a questionable, dirty joke. The prospect of Rolf Harris being rude and crude is just too tempting. </p> <p>\"There was an Australian who was working in America, and got himself a five-month contract as a quantity surveyor. He didn't really want to book into a hotel, he wanted to get himself a little house and rent it. Which he did. He bought himself some el cheapo furniture, just some minimum things, and he's arranging them in this house. Then this guy arrives in this big Cadillac, he's in work clothes, dungarees, then he gets out and puts this big Stetson on, comes up to the Australian bloke and says, 'Hey, I'm your nearest neighbour, and I just called round to say howdy. Now, I'm throwing a barbecue tonight to welcome you to the area.'\"</p> <p>All this is recounted, of course, in an extremely convincing Texan accent. \"'Start about 5.30. Plenty to eat, plenty to drink, music for dancing, and later on some sex and some fighting, maybe.' And the Australian guy's eyebrows go up and he says, 'Yeah, well, I'm not so sure about the last two. But thanks for the invitation. What should I wear?' The other chap says, 'Just come as you are. There'll only be the two of us.'\" And for the first time in our interview, Rolf Harris seems dated. If he considers that a dirty joke, he obviously hasn't heard much of the comedy going around the clubs these days. </p> <p>If I think his success hinges on failing to offend anyone, Rolf has other ideas. \"It's essential that you make eye contact with your audience. You've got to know what's happening out there. If you make eye contact with just one person, everybody in the place, by some indefinable magic, is sure that you're talking to them personally. I learned that very early on. Hermione Gingold - remember her? - told me, 'Make eye contact or you're dead.'\" (For those of you who don't remember Hermione, she was a comedienne and cabaret performer who began her career entertaining US troops during the Blitz.)</p> <p>\"That's the secret of anybody's success. That's why my stuff works at these big rock venues. A lot of the bands come on and they just sing at people, they never look at them, they never involve them. If you're not singing to them, if you're just singing to a point on the wall, you might just as well be a record playing. A record playing would be better, actually, because the quality's going to be better.\" </p> <p>Whatever Rolf is doing, he does it live. When he was asked on to Top Of The Pops following the phenomenal success of his didgeridoo version of Led Zeppelin's Stairway To Heaven in 1993, he performed without a backing track. The production staff was so unprepared, they had to hunt around for spare microphones and monitors. Even then, live acts were rare. \"I hate miming things, I can't bear it, it upsets me,\" he says with uncharacteristic venom. </p> <p>Harris may have his hand on the mike, but he doesn't have his finger on the pulse; it's rumoured that he had no idea who Led Zeppelin were when he got involved in Stairway To Heaven. \"To Rolf, I suspect it was a bunch of lyrics and a piece of music,\" said Simon Bates, whose repetitive playing of the record on his Radio 1 show was the main reason behind its phenomenal rise. Its success, and the subsequent tour around student unions, forced Harris to form his own band for the first time, nicknamed The Roo Brothers. </p> <p>\"In a funny way, the band has helped me considerably, by not only playing what I want to do, but also suggesting things I would never have dreamt of doing in a million years, things like - what's the Lou Reed track?\" I have to remind him - Perfect Day. \"They said, 'That'd be ideal for you.' I said, 'You're kidding!' They said, 'No, honestly.'\" Perfect Day is by no means Harris's best remake. Honestly. </p> <p>Is Rolf Harris, aged 70, reaching his musical maturity? \"It's really nice to be able to call the tune. To be able to say, 'This is what I want to do.' I don't care whether it's musically right, but I want to do this. It's probably the first time in my life I've had that happen, in the past three or four years. Before that, you're always being told by other people, by other musicians, 'Well, musically, it's not really very good.' You can't do this, you can't do that. I was never quite confident enough to say, 'Well, look, this is what I want to do.'\" </p> <p>While his younger audience was being regenerated in clubs and at festivals, on the television he won the contract to present Animal Hospital, a job for which Ken Livingstone was first considered. It was not an instant success. \"The truth of the matter was that Rolf was a huge risk,\" says Lorraine Heggessey, who was executive producer on the original series. The first two programmes went only reasonably well.</p> <p>But on the third day, a tough-looking guy dressed in denim came in with a very sick German Shepherd called Floss. Floss had to be put down, and her owner became very distressed. Rolf offered comfort, putting his arm around him, and was soon in tears himself. \"That night, people saw the German Shepherd being put down and Rolf crying live on national television,\" said Heggessey. \"The next day it was the talking point of the nation.

      "bodyText": "There were thousands of us. The crowd was bigger than that for Suzanne Vega. It was bigger even than that for the doyen of world music, Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour, even though we were at Womad, the annual festival of world music. No, this was the man we all wanted to see. We recognise his face instantly. We trust the square glasses, the ruthlessly trimmed beard. We know the words to every single one of his songs. \"You're a hero,\" cried out a white Rasta. The crowd began to shout his name. Can you tell who it is yet? \"Rolf, Rolf, Rolf, Rolf... \" Rolf Harris is wearing a T-shirt with a cartoon of Rolf Harris on it, drawn by Rolf Harris. He is entirely self-referential. He cannot be compared to any one else. Cartoonist, entertainer, raconteur, percussionist, singer, songwriter, painter, one-man world music machine, TV presenter and, aged 70, about to hit the club scene with a dance track. When he performed Fine Day, his first new single in five years, the crowd went wild. He could have done anything with them. He could have done anything with me. I had conned my way on to the stage wing with my seven-year-old daughter, to be closer to the man himself. He came over to us and shook my hand. I don't like to admit it, but I felt weak at the knees. I could barely bring myself to ask how old he was. \"Seventy,\" he said. I muttered some half-audible, \"No, surely, you can't possibly be.\" If Rolf Harris is old, I realised, then I must be getting that way, too. \"I'm fine, apart from this,\" he said, and waved the crutch he uses to help him get around. A knee operation has left him with a limp. \"Jake The Peg really has three legs!\" cheered my daughter. Within a moment of the meeting, we are both devoted to him. I was determined to see him again. So here I am, four weeks later, at an anonymous Heathrow hotel, interviewing Rolf. We are in the lounge... I don't need to describe it, they're all the same, you can envisage it exactly. I'll just give you one visual clue: the carpet was a mushy green, and patterned. Everything else was made of vinyl. This is how the interview began. \"Dee, dee, dagga dagga, dagga dagga, dagga dagga, brrr, buph, buph, buph, tip, tip,\" says Rolf. He hisses like a kettle whistling, when kettles used to whistle. Then he blows a raspberry. \"I love getting different sounds and working out different rhythms,\" he explains. \"I was listening to Radio 1 in the car, and they had one of those dance tracks without any voice at all, just going... \" and he starts off again, \"bumph, dee, bumph, dee, chuph, chuph, bumph, bumph, bumph, brrrrrrr. The drum machine going like mad, dee, dee, dagga dagga... All these synchronised drum sounds. I kept waiting for someone to say something, but there was no voice at all. And it just went on, it seemed like for an hour. Out of boredom, I was thinking, what sort of words? I'd heard some tracks before when guys had done very tongue-twisting lines. Digedde, gedde, geddddd. Something like that. I kept thinking what sort of words would work on a really fast thing? And I thought, wanna, wanna, wonna, winna... \" This is the start of the story of how Fine Day was conceived, probably the only dance track to be written and performed by a 70-year-old. Well past pensionable age, Rolf Harris has started to share a record label with De La Soul, Pimpadelic, Screwball, Coolio and Grammy winners Everlast. Perhaps I ought to explain a couple of things first, before you get the wrong impression about Rolf. He is not some reinvented 60s icon, a sad, ageing man with a limp who refuses to grow old, a Peter Stringfellow of the world music scene. When Rolf uses the word \"guys\", he is not being hip, he is being Australian, in an 80s, or even earlier sense. He says \"square\" as if he's just discovered the word, as in \"it was square to like Rolf Harris until I recorded Stairway To Heaven\". He still uses \"disco\" when he means \"dance\". He's wearing a turquoise shirt, a colour that is irretrievably associated with a decade that gave birth to the Bay City Rollers and the Arctic roll. Although we might now find Rolf fashionable, and we may cheer him at our festivals (he's played Womad, Glastonbury and Guildford this year), it's not Rolf that's changed. We have. He reminds us of when we were young, when children's TV had real-life stars and not cartoon characters as heroes. Rolf has not attempted to keep up with us. We have gone back to him. The song that received the biggest cheer at Womad was Two Little Boys, a sentimental ballad about the American Civil War that is hardly cutting edge, and that Rolf first sang in 1969. Margaret Thatcher chose it as one of her Desert Island Discs. The other point that it's important to make is that Rolf does not speak our language. It's not only that this man has introduced objects with ridiculous names - wobble-board, didgeridoo, Rolfaroo, Coojee Bear, Stylophone (which David Frost dubbed \"the world's smallest organ\") - into our everyday vocabulary, he speaks a tongue that is only partly made up of recognisable words. The rest is rhythm sounds - impossible to write down with any accuracy - which are usually inextricably linked to some arm movements, rather like the actions that accompany children's nursery songs. Alwen Hughes, Harris's wife for 42 years, bemoans, \"Rolf has always made weird noises.\" Only after a good 20 minutes of talking - if we can give that word to the sounds that emerge from Rolf's agile lips - does he sit back a moment and say, \"I don't know how you'd write that - wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna\", helpfully suggesting a few alternative spellings. He resumes his wah-wahing for another five minutes, until it changes from \"wanna wanna\" to \"wunna wanna\". This, explains Rolf, is \"wouldn't want to\" said extremely fast. A few minutes of wunna wanna follow, during which he gets so excited that he knocks off his big bifocals, before beginning to speak our language again. \"I was doing all these sounds, and I was going into a dinner with Peter Salmon, controller of BBC1. He laid on a meal for a few of the top BBC presenters. I was sitting next to one of the weather girls. Really good-looking blonde girl. I was talking to her about all the problems of her job, how they manage to refer to the screen when they only see it on a monitor... I was so impressed with it. We had a nice long conversation. Then, on the way home in the car, I put on Radio 1 again, trying to find another bit of rhythm, because I had this thing going in my head. That would work well, wouldn't it?\" I wonder what he's referring to, but he begins to sing, \"Another bit of rhythm, another bit, another bit... \" extremely fast, until it becomes, \"anna bi, anna bi, anna bi\"... \"I'm really keen on words that create a fascinating rhythm. I did a song about Pavlova, the dessert.\" This may read like a non sequitur, but when Rolf Harris says \"Pavlova\", it sounds like the percussion section of a pub band. Without being prompted, he sings me a line: \"Then he got out another meringue, a big one, then a banana... cut it up into a lot of bite-sized pieces.\" He sang these words faster than you can ever read them. He then started banging out a rhythm on the vinyl table. Anything will do as his drum. Then, without so much as a skipped breath, we're back to the story of the creation of Fine Day. \"Wouldn't want to worry what the weatherwoman told you... It just developed over the three quarters of an hour drive home to my place.\" These words, garbled so fast they are unrecognisable (\"wunna wanna worree wa wether... \"), became the lyrics. He makes no concession to the club scene, apart from his music. His brown leather shoes are splattered with paint, as if to give a hint of who he might be. But there is never any doubt. It would be impossible to disguise or alter him. I flicked through his books - The A-To-Z Of Animal Hospital, Draw Your Own Cartoons With Rolf Harris, Tall Animal Tales, True Animal Tales - and his 70th birthday tribute, The Court Of King Rolf. In every picture, he looks exactly the same. The same smile, the same bit of a chin, the same glasses, the same beard. He always seems a certain age, never 16 and certainly not 70. He has always been Rolf Harris, whether singing his version of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody or Two Little Boys. I came across one photograph, taken while he was in his 20s and had just arrived in England. He has tightly curled dark hair, no glasses, no beard. When I showed it to a friend of mine, she called it \"scary\". It was like coming across your granddad without any clothes on. Rolf Harris has always been nothing other than Rolf Harris. He was born that way. His mother gave him no other names. He was brought up, no doubt humming and whistling before he could even walk, in a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, by parents who had emigrated from Wales. Aged 15, he became Australian Junior Backstroke Champion. (Remember the TV safety campaign he later headed, imploring all us pommie kids to learn to swim?) He entered the national radio Australia's Amateur Hour with his very own version of Seven Beers With The Wrong Woman. (It now seems near impossible to imagine Harris singing a song with such a suggestive title.) It was voted the best performance, and he was offered a slot in a variety show at Her Majesty's Theatre, Perth. His stage career was launched. At 22, and clean-shaven for the last time, he came to Britain to study painting at the London Art School. \"The constant feeling I picked up from my parents was that England was the hub of the universe, that this part of the world was the centre of everything. They referred to it as Home, in inverted commas and with a capital H. I thought I had enough money to last me for life, but I ran out of money very soon in that first year. The money I had went... \" and he makes the sound of something being sucked down a Hoover. He continues the story: \"I'm now without any loot and I've got a job singing at an Australian club called the Down Under once a week. That netted me two and a half quid for three hours' work. I was doing portraits of people, in oils, for \u00a35 a time. I dropped out of art school because I got a job doing cabaret at the Gargoyle Club in the West End, at the piano, singing clever songs, boogie. I was getting home at three in the morning. And art school wasn't giving me what I wanted. Then I met up with a painter, Hayward Veal. I became a sort of disciple of his. This guy taught me all about impressionist painting. Then I got a job on children's television doing drawing and telling stories. Veal was the one who got me on the right road for doing all these huge paintings I did on television in the late 60s and into the 70s and 80s. I was just using a very strictly organised, simplified version of his impressionist painting.\" It's easy to imagine Harris's career being launched at an amateur competition; there is something about him that seems very unrehearsed. Whatever he's doing - whether playing his squeezebox or dashing off a Rolfaroo cartoon - it appears as if he is not professionally performing but simply doing his party piece. This is an illusion. On his first adult Saturday night TV series, The Rolf Harris Show, accompanied by the irreparably dated Young Generation dance troupe, he would draw huge landscapes on 12ft x 9ft backdrops. It looked effortless. But Harris would practise the paintings in full size as many as five times, against a stopwatch, so he could recreate them live in the allotted time each week. He's a man with fidgety hands and a very active mouth. They're always up to something. His new bride used to complain that he wrote songs on the menu at the Grill &amp; Cheese, a Lyons Corner House in Marble Arch to which he frequently took her. Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport is said to have been composed on the back of one such menu. He famously whistles while he executes his cartoons, interrupting only to shout, \"Can you tell what it is yet?\" (\"Can you tell what it is yet?\" has remained his catchphrase.) Somehow, he manages to eat his club sandwich while demonstrating how to play a Jew's harp. \"Val Doonican showed me how to play that properly - 20 years ago,\" he says. (I try to remember if Val Doonican is still alive.) He is a one-man band, and I am a one-woman audience, but at least I am an audience, and a very appreciative one. \"He is addicted to applause - that would be hard for him to give up,\" says Alwen. \"Rolf has had continuous praise all his life and has become accustomed to it.\" It is being appreciated that matters to him. It's no use pestering Rolf about the meaning of his work. There is nothing behind and beyond what you see. Questions that attempt to be penetrating, to extract meaning, are answered in exactly the same manner, as straightforward factual enquiries. Everything is turned into a story accompanied by a one-man rhythm section. There is only one level on which Rolf operates, and it is not deep. His appeal is primal. His songs reach parts other songs just don't reach. They nearly always involve repetition, to be comforting, and most (Jake The Peg, I've Lost My Mummy, Six White Boomers, Two Little Boys) are written from the viewpoint of a child. Being a child, of course, is a universal experience. We've all been there at some point; we all at some point long to return. But we can glimpse that lost place singing along with Rolf, who reminds us that we were once innocent, lovely little beings (\"little\" is a recurrent word in his lyrics) who liked to play and make up silly rhymes, just like he does. There must be a Mr Nasty somewhere inside that Mr Nice. There just must be. But try as I might, I couldn't find him. Rolf had just got off a nine and a half hour flight from Vancouver, and was leaving in a couple of hours to film the video for Fine Day in Cannes, with no time for even a shower between flights, yet it was me, a stranger, he was concerned about. \"Would you like some coffee?\" he asks, cupping my elbow in his palm. Perhaps his greatest crime is being anodyne. He is a bit too easy to like - not exactly a trait to be listed alongside the deadly sins. He is utterly inoffensive, with the single exception of having a reputation for telling right-off jokes, particularly about the Irish. I beg him to tell me one. \"There's a great one that really reflects that whole politically-correct thing,\" he says. \"But you can't really write it, because it depends on accent.\" In the scheme of things, conveying accent seemed a minor problem when I came to transcribe the tape. Harris claims he heard the joke from the comedian Barry Cryer. \"This Irish fella rings up the maternity ward at the hospital and asks if they've any news about his wife, who's in labour at the moment. The matron on the other end of the phone says, 'Is this her first child?' And he says, 'No, it's her husband.'\" The whole thing is told in a rather good Irish accent. Harris chuckles. \"Do you think you can laugh about practically anything?\" I ask him. His response is swift. \"No.... raw the line at filth and crude language. It seems to be an excuse for not being funny.\" I remembered that when he said the word \"bloody\" in front of the Womad crowd, I had been genuinely shocked. Rolf Harris just didn't speak like that. \"I've told some questionable jokes,\" he continues, \"which could be called dirty jokes, but with the proviso that they've got to be funny.\" I ask him to tell me a questionable, dirty joke. The prospect of Rolf Harris being rude and crude is just too tempting. \"There was an Australian who was working in America, and got himself a five-month contract as a quantity surveyor. He didn't really want to book into a hotel, he wanted to get himself a little house and rent it. Which he did. He bought himself some el cheapo furniture, just some minimum things, and he's arranging them in this house. Then this guy arrives in this big Cadillac, he's in work clothes, dungarees, then he gets out and puts this big Stetson on, comes up to the Australian bloke and says, 'Hey, I'm your nearest neighbour, and I just called round to say howdy. Now, I'm throwing a barbecue tonight to welcome you to the area.'\" All this is recounted, of course, in an extremely convincing Texan accent. \"'Start about 5.30. Plenty to eat, plenty to drink, music for dancing, and later on some sex and some fighting, maybe.' And the Australian guy's eyebrows go up and he says, 'Yeah, well, I'm not so sure about the last two. But thanks for the invitation. What should I wear?' The other chap says, 'Just come as you are. There'll only be the two of us.'\" And for the first time in our interview, Rolf Harris seems dated. If he considers that a dirty joke, he obviously hasn't heard much of the comedy going around the clubs these days. If I think his success hinges on failing to offend anyone, Rolf has other ideas. \"It's essential that you make eye contact with your audience. You've got to know what's happening out there. If you make eye contact with just one person, everybody in the place, by some indefinable magic, is sure that you're talking to them personally. I learned that very early on. Hermione Gingold - remember her? - told me, 'Make eye contact or you're dead.'\" (For those of you who don't remember Hermione, she was a comedienne and cabaret performer who began her career entertaining US troops during the Blitz.) \"That's the secret of anybody's success. That's why my stuff works at these big rock venues. A lot of the bands come on and they just sing at people, they never look at them, they never involve them. If you're not singing to them, if you're just singing to a point on the wall, you might just as well be a record playing. A record playing would be better, actually, because the quality's going to be better.\" Whatever Rolf is doing, he does it live. When he was asked on to Top Of The Pops following the phenomenal success of his didgeridoo version of Led Zeppelin's Stairway To Heaven in 1993, he performed without a backing track. The production staff was so unprepared, they had to hunt around for spare microphones and monitors. Even then, live acts were rare. \"I hate miming things, I can't bear it, it upsets me,\" he says with uncharacteristic venom. Harris may have his hand on the mike, but he doesn't have his finger on the pulse; it's rumoured that he had no idea who Led Zeppelin were when he got involved in Stairway To Heaven. \"To Rolf, I suspect it was a bunch of lyrics and a piece of music,\" said Simon Bates, whose repetitive playing of the record on his Radio 1 show was the main reason behind its phenomenal rise. Its success, and the subsequent tour around student unions, forced Harris to form his own band for the first time, nicknamed The Roo Brothers. \"In a funny way, the band has helped me considerably, by not only playing what I want to do, but also suggesting things I would never have dreamt of doing in a million years, things like - what's the Lou Reed track?\" I have to remind him - Perfect Day. \"They said, 'That'd be ideal for you.' I said, 'You're kidding!' They said, 'No, honestly.'\" Perfect Day is by no means Harris's best remake. Honestly. Is Rolf Harris, aged 70, reaching his musical maturity? \"It's really nice to be able to call the tune. To be able to say, 'This is what I want to do.' I don't care whether it's musically right, but I want to do this. It's probably the first time in my life I've had that happen, in the past three or four years. Before that, you're always being told by other people, by other musicians, 'Well, musically, it's not really very good.' You can't do this, you can't do that. I was never quite confident enough to say, 'Well, look, this is what I want to do.'\" While his younger audience was being regenerated in clubs and at festivals, on the television he won the contract to present Animal Hospital, a job for which Ken Livingstone was first considered. It was not an instant success. \"The truth of the matter was that Rolf was a huge risk,\" says Lorraine Heggessey, who was executive producer on the original series. The first two programmes went only reasonably well. But on the third day, a tough-looking guy dressed in denim came in with a very sick German Shepherd called Floss. Floss had to be put down, and her owner became very distressed. Rolf offered comfort, putting his arm around him, and was soon in tears himself. \"That night, people saw the German Shepherd being put down and Rolf crying live on national television,\" said Heggessey. \"The next day it was the talking point of the nation. The next night our rating shot up to nearly 10 million.\" Was this a case of false sentimentality? Was this a ruthless TV personality, desperate to secure his foothold in popular broadcasting after his Cartoon Club had been axed, making a calculated display of emotion to boost the audience? I suspect not. With Harris, what you see is what you get. There is no artifice. The presenter of Animal Hospital and Rolf's Amazing World Of Animals went on this year's annual holiday with his one wife, one daughter and one four-year-old grandson to a Kenyan elephant orphanage. Dougie Squires, who choreographed The Rolf Harris Show, said, \"I wish I could dish the dirt about this man, but there is none.\" The only thing that appears to be artificial is his teeth. He is ever so nice, ever so warm, and has plenty of time for absolutely everyone. As he's gathering up his various instruments ready to leave - the accordion, the bagpipes, the didgeridoo, the Jew's harp - he breaks off to draw a cartoon for my daughter, whistling throughout, even though he is already late checking in for his flight. As we descend to the lobby, he hugs the hotel manager. He hugs the publicity girl. He hugs me. He waves and smiles from the back of the car, ever cheery, his didgeridoo jammed up against him, his 10-gallon hat - the sort that ought to be hung with corks - on his head. He looks like a cartoon. In fact, he looks like a Rolf Harris cartoon. I expect he always will. Then the car drives away, until I can no longer tell who it is. \u0095 Fine Day is released on September 25.",

She is still extant, though, in the long-running newspaper strip. And she's alive and kicking (literally - as a martial arts expert) on the internet, thanks to her fans and much to O'Donnell's surprise. </p> <p>Modesty's age has always been problematical: in the last book, Cobra Trap (now reissued <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501183120,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), someone surmises that she's 52, \"though her body would have passed for 30\". On her website, though, a meanie has calculated that with so many adventures notched up, she must be over 70. </p> <p>Chronology is not O'Donnell's strong point, but his own creative span is undisputed. He started work as a teenager in Fleet Street on \"picture stories\" - illustrated adventure serials for young readers. Modesty is a daughter of this genre. She was conceived 38 years ago and O'Donnell, now 80, is still backing her into tight corners in the daily syndicated version. Though the scams and scoundrels she's been involved with over the decades have been updated, what hasn't altered is the moral line - drawn somewhat arbitrarily, it may seem - and the way in which O'Donnell strives to keep her on the right side of it. </p> <p>The outfit she ran - the Network - can't be classified as just another criminal gang. Based in Tangier, it was tacitly approved by the authorities, which it sometimes helped. Its operatives, though they handled many a murky assignment, never tangled with the trade in drugs or sex. And even when a load of butch broads muscled in on her act - in the Bond books and movies and TV's Charlie's Angels - Modesty refused to become a female Rambo. </p> <p>O'Donnell is proud of the way she has stuck to her standards. \"She does other things besides kick people in the head,\" he says. \"She's very compassionate and vulnerable.\" In the early days, she would have a little weep on Willie's chest when they had been in a dicey situation, but soon pull herself together. </p> <p>Modesty bid farewell to the Network several books ago and, as a very rich retiree, could afford to be picky about her subsequent challenges. She in turn has seen O'Donnell right, setting him up with a handsome home in an unspoilt Brighton square. Along with the 12 Modesty books, two other authors get pride of place on his study shelves: Madeleine Brent is blazoned on a set of bright dustjackets, while Bernard O'Donnell graces the faded spines of the other set. </p> <p>Both hold the key to O'Donnell's success. Bernard was his crime reporter father, who also wrote volumes on cops and crims and gave his young son a sniff of gangland and Fleet Street. Madeleine is O'Donnell himself in drag as a romantic novelist, proving that the way to writerly wealth is to have two personae. </p> <p>As a kid, he'd find stubbly scar-faced characters at the breakfast table, invited in by his dad, who knew gangland from Bethnal Green to Brighton racecourse. He was also on nodding terms with everyone in \"The Print\". \"My old man trundled me round the newspaper offices when I was 17, giving them all first refusal of this brilliant lad,\" recalls O'Donnell, \"and they all refused!\" But Amalgamated Press took him on, writing storylines for its stable of publications for young people. </p> <p>\"It was a hard school,\" he says: writing to order, to length and to time; literate but not literary. It was hackwork at its best, and it paid off in a post-war Fleet Street avid for fiction as well as fact. \"I used to write 20,000 words a week: an adventure, a detective, a western; short stories and scripts for strips.\" He worked in a big garret above El Vino's, but there was a flipside to the conviviality of hacks.

From a wartime posting in the Caucasus he remembered a refugee girl, all alone at 12 or 13, who was given food by his unit, smiled her thanks and went on her way. He often pondered the mystery of her rootlessness, and years later used it as the basis for the footloose independence of Ms Blaise: the original wild child.

They do not perform an action in one way or another; they either do it, or fail to do it. Such a view is now, as it doubtless was already to Homer's audiences, an idealistic dream of pure action - of man as his own reliable instrument, unassailed by doubts or contradictory intentions. </p> <p>The first third of In the Shape of a Boar recounts how the ancient heroes gather in order to hunt the monstrous Boar of Kalydon, a ferocious beast that is ravaging the land because their leader's father omitted to honour Artemis in his sacrifices. The hunt is much celebrated in Greek art and sculpture. But just as the Odyssey is set at the fraught intersection between the imagined ancient purity of heroic action and the compromises of modernity - its hero, the wily Odysseus, is the man who is expert at seeming otherwise than he is - so Norfolk fashions something more doubtful and weirdly compelling from his mythical sources. His heroes track the beast into a terrain where no traces can be left: a (non-canonical) place called Agrapha, \"unwritten things\".

      "bodyText": "In the Shape of a Boar Lawrence Norfolk 320pp, Weidenfeld \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL Greek heroes, according to Lawrence Norfolk's astonishing new novel, do not require adverbs. They do not perform an action in one way or another; they either do it, or fail to do it. Such a view is now, as it doubtless was already to Homer's audiences, an idealistic dream of pure action - of man as his own reliable instrument, unassailed by doubts or contradictory intentions. The first third of In the Shape of a Boar recounts how the ancient heroes gather in order to hunt the monstrous Boar of Kalydon, a ferocious beast that is ravaging the land because their leader's father omitted to honour Artemis in his sacrifices. The hunt is much celebrated in Greek art and sculpture. But just as the Odyssey is set at the fraught intersection between the imagined ancient purity of heroic action and the compromises of modernity - its hero, the wily Odysseus, is the man who is expert at seeming otherwise than he is - so Norfolk fashions something more doubtful and weirdly compelling from his mythical sources. His heroes track the beast into a terrain where no traces can be left: a (non-canonical) place called Agrapha, \"unwritten things\". Its hellish blankness stands for, among other things, the unknowability of unsung lives. Unknowable, too, are the shapes of the original myths themselves: heroes die in one telling, only to reappear fighting a new enemy in another version. Norfolk floods the first few pages of his account with an ironic surge of scholarly footnotes, tributaries of manifold myth-rivers merging in a wild sea of contradictory meanings. Slowly this babble of papyric voices recedes, drawing the reader in expertly to the potent tug of the main text; eventually the footnotes reappear to trace the ambivalences of the tale's mysterious end.

He made further enquiries with the eminent psychologist Halla Beloff, who confirmed that a liking for flowers, and skill at flowering arranging, were part of a traditional evaluation of sexual identity and orientation. Later, she got back to him with further thoughts on the subject - opening the conversation with the question,\"Have you considered the phallic dimension of mowing?\" Her thinking was that pushing out all that thrusting, throbbing motor mower in front of you, cutting a swathe through the rampaging grass and making nice straight lines fits the male desire to feel potent and to change the world. </p> <p>Fort asked lawnsman and novelist Jim Crace about this impulse: \"Crace thought it sprang from a deeply imprinted desire to control and domesticate nature.

Readers who haven't read him yet will find this collection the perfect way to make his acquaintance. Normally a novelist, McInerney has set out to prove he can handle that slippery form, the short story. He succeeds with ease. His efforts all manage to run their natural length, being genuinely short without feeling compacted or reading like novels ruthlessly sliced off at either end. They aren't overstuffed with character or incident, nor are they heavy with laborious detail. They are single-issue without being simple-minded. A couple spend their first Christmas together on opposing drugs (one on uppers, one on downers). The girl ends up wishing she could strip her visible skin off altogether and arise brand-new.

His first novel Electric Brae (1992) was excellent, while his poetry is uniformly good. He has also written two books about his experiences as a mountaineer.

In his acknowledgments Greig name-checks Fighter by Len Deighton and The People's War by Angus Calder. Their influence is palpable. What distinguishes That Summer is what distinguishes all of Greig's work: the teasing out of the complex relationship between irresolution and adventure. </p> <p>Len, for example, comes to self-knowledge through his relationship with the fearless Polish airman Tadeusz: \"I knew then I'd never really be a true fighter pilot. I hadn't that careless capacity to live in the present, to be, as they said, regardless.\" Meanwhile Stella befriends Maddy, a \"cheery bouncing blonde\" who teaches her to leave behind her \"long drawn-out adolescence\" and \"insecure snobbery\". </p> <p>The flab and the fat of the poetic that was off-putting in some of Greig's earlier novels has finally been sweated off, and the prose is now down to its fighting weight.

Fair dos, you might think, they get into all kinds of scrapes. What surprised me was when I learned that insurers - or at least the ones I have the misfortune to deal with - don't like even book reviewers that much. Speaking as someone whose main professional fear lies in typing half a paragraph in capital letters by mistake, this strikes me as unnecessarily cautious. (True, Jeanette Winterson has been known to serenade reviewers with invective in the small hours, but it's hardly criminal damage and you can take steps to avoid this, mainly by not reviewing her work.) </p> <p>So I'm quite excited to discover that I may be entering into a little literary controversy simply by mentioning this novel. I picked it up off the pile with few expectations, beyond the fact that its publisher is pretty reputable and it had a laudatory quote from Alberto Manguel, author of the intelligent and likeable A History of Reading, on the back. A Times reviewer, unnamed, said \"tense, chillingly beautiful, moving ... this is first-class reading\". </p> <p>Well, one learns to take such things with a pinch of salt, for there are often wheels within wheels when it comes to reviewing (though not in these pages, of course), but Manguel carries a fair amount of weight round these parts, so off I went. </p> <p>The story begins in 1957, as a young Parisian flautist hires Saffie, a fascinatingly inscrutable German, to be his maid. She fascinates him so much, in fact, that he asks her to marry him. \"That's OK with me,\" she says. (The novel has been translated from the French by the author.) The only change of tone in her calm, almost supernatural indifference comes when she freaks out completely at the sound of an alarm clock; and, during her pregnancy, when Huston does a cleverly understated but still quite alarming attempted auto-abortion scene. When the child is born, we duly fear for its safety. </p> <p>It turns out that Saffie, of course, has some very nasty memories of the war; and when she meets a charismatic Hungarian instrument repairer called Andr\u00e1s, they can share their unspoken war traumas, in a manner of speaking (or not speaking). Meanwhile, as Huston reminds us, the French are doing terrible things to Algerians. </p> <p>It all chunters along quite enjoyably if you read it without too many expectations, or much scrutiny. Huston's voice may occasionally become irritatingly arch, but it is still very readable; as befits a book that was not only a best-seller in France but won the Grand Prix des Lectrices d'Elle - by which I understand that the readers of the French edition of Elle magazine considered it their fave book of 1998. This was one of the grievances of a highly dismissive review in the TLS, which complained that the novel's triteness was particularly offensive in the light of the events it leans on for its historical power. </p> <p>At which point this reviewer raises his hands in despair. I can see what the objections are to this novel; it is, in truth, a far thinner story than it claims to be. And yet it is perfectly pleasurable to read. It is not criminally inane, like that novel Damage by Josephine Hart, which was turned into a rotten film with Jeremy Irons. One reads The Mark of the Angel at the kitchen table, munching an apple and at times forgetting which hand is holding the apple and which the book. And there is room in the culture for that kind of novel, isn't there?</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Mark of the Angel Nancy Huston Vintage, \u00a36.99 Buy it at BOL You may know that insurers purse their lips when it comes to insuring journalists. Fair dos, you might think, they get into all kinds of scrapes. What surprised me was when I learned that insurers - or at least the ones I have the misfortune to deal with - don't like even book reviewers that much. Speaking as someone whose main professional fear lies in typing half a paragraph in capital letters by mistake, this strikes me as unnecessarily cautious. (True, Jeanette Winterson has been known to serenade reviewers with invective in the small hours, but it's hardly criminal damage and you can take steps to avoid this, mainly by not reviewing her work.) So I'm quite excited to discover that I may be entering into a little literary controversy simply by mentioning this novel. I picked it up off the pile with few expectations, beyond the fact that its publisher is pretty reputable and it had a laudatory quote from Alberto Manguel, author of the intelligent and likeable A History of Reading, on the back. A Times reviewer, unnamed, said \"tense, chillingly beautiful, moving ... this is first-class reading\". Well, one learns to take such things with a pinch of salt, for there are often wheels within wheels when it comes to reviewing (though not in these pages, of course), but Manguel carries a fair amount of weight round these parts, so off I went. The story begins in 1957, as a young Parisian flautist hires Saffie, a fascinatingly inscrutable German, to be his maid. She fascinates him so much, in fact, that he asks her to marry him. \"That's OK with me,\" she says. (The novel has been translated from the French by the author.) The only change of tone in her calm, almost supernatural indifference comes when she freaks out completely at the sound of an alarm clock; and, during her pregnancy, when Huston does a cleverly understated but still quite alarming attempted auto-abortion scene. When the child is born, we duly fear for its safety. It turns out that Saffie, of course, has some very nasty memories of the war; and when she meets a charismatic Hungarian instrument repairer called Andr\u00e1s, they can share their unspoken war traumas, in a manner of speaking (or not speaking). Meanwhile, as Huston reminds us, the French are doing terrible things to Algerians. It all chunters along quite enjoyably if you read it without too many expectations, or much scrutiny. Huston's voice may occasionally become irritatingly arch, but it is still very readable; as befits a book that was not only a best-seller in France but won the Grand Prix des Lectrices d'Elle - by which I understand that the readers of the French edition of Elle magazine considered it their fave book of 1998. This was one of the grievances of a highly dismissive review in the TLS, which complained that the novel's triteness was particularly offensive in the light of the events it leans on for its historical power. At which point this reviewer raises his hands in despair. I can see what the objections are to this novel; it is, in truth, a far thinner story than it claims to be. And yet it is perfectly pleasurable to read. It is not criminally inane, like that novel Damage by Josephine Hart, which was turned into a rotten film with Jeremy Irons. One reads The Mark of the Angel at the kitchen table, munching an apple and at times forgetting which hand is holding the apple and which the book. And there is room in the culture for that kind of novel, isn't there?",

In the course of this relationship Noone is able to discuss, and come to terms with, his relationship with Jess and also with his own parents, particularly his provocatively prejudiced yet stumblingly loving father. The healing that Pete affords Noone is compromised, however, by doubt. Did Pete write his own story? Is Pete's story true?

He finds it far less deserted than he imagined, and this fact provokes further self-scrutiny. During the course of the novel little else happens, save from some minor shuffling of characters and one swift, brutal event that occurs offstage at the end; but here psychological investigation stands in for plot, and Banville's inward prose comes to seem both populous and crowded with incident. </p> <p>The narrator of Eclipse, Alexander Cleave, is a classical actor who has recently corpsed during a first-night speech and fled, reputation in tatters, into self-imposed exile. Despite a sense of enfolding mental crisis, his narcissism remains largely intact, much to the exasperation and despair of his abandoned wife, Lydia, who accurately detects in his return to his mother's old, creaky house the curse of arrested development. \"I dreamed last night I was a child and here again,\" Cleave confides to her at the novel's opening, to which she justly retorts: \"Of course; you never left here, that's the truth.\" But the insight only provokes in its object an admiration for his wife's use of iambic pentameter; later, when she challenges him in vain once again, he muses on whether her accusations take the form of anapaests or \"the rarer, shyer amphibrach\". His recourse to infuriating pedantry is in part sadistic, but also points towards a mental armoury which mere words or stray thoughts cannot easily dismantle. </p> <p>In a state of agonised self-consciousness, Cleave clings to the limbo that the house offers: a way, as he puts it, of \"being alive with out living\". Variously, he ascribes this paralysis to an emotional cauterisation probably inflicted on him during childhood; to the dead parents for whom he did not grieve; to the profession that has imbued him with a constant sense of being watched and has required of him his own constant watchfulness; and to his daughter Cass, similarly tormented by demons and now miserably cordoned off in her own world. </p> <p>\"What confusion there is in me; I really am a stranger to myself,\" Cleave reflects, but his proposed solution to that inner chaos is a period of quiet introspection that soon begins to seem almost wilfully misguided. Amid the false starts and blind alleys of remembrance, he is besieged by ghosts - as he would have us and himself believe, actual ghostly presences - who move about his house in \"naggingly insinuative\" fashion; \"ancestral resemblances\" who make the furniture they perch upon \"blush, almost, in the surprise of being singled out\". In time, the phantoms are displaced by solid humans; by the sly surprise of Quirke, the caretaker of the house who has furtively moved in, together with his slatternly adolescent daughter, Lily. The pair regard Cleave with a mixture of bemused concern and insolent tolerance, and their arrival on the scene, like characters in a Shakespearean subplot, provides humorous counterpoint to the would-be tragic hero's manic melancholia. Banville's handling of this strand of the novel is impeccable: the gruesome comedy of manners alternating with the painful impulse that prompts Cleave to take on, ineptly and disastrously, the role of paterfamilias. </p> <p>If the psychological wranglings of the situation are familiar - the unresolved detritus of childhood, the fruitless search for an authentic sense of self - then the language and tone in which they are conveyed makes them hard to recognise, not in the sense that they are unconvincing, but because the mental trauma they provoke is near impossible to unpick. \"Making strange\", in the idiom of Cleave's provincial town, is used to describe the upset of a frightened child when confronted by an unknown adult, and Cleave is indeed estranged from himself and from the world about him. Stranded in a past that has no use for him, he is plagued by delusion and suspended in a state of \"transcendent tipsiness\", an alienation that renders him both pitiful and monstrous. </p> <p>Banville's flighted prose, in which atmosphere is evoked through a dripfeed of lyricism, is superbly suited to his subject matter; his willed patience and defiant wordiness resonate with an almost unbearable sense of claustrophobia and the lurid excess of breakdown. At one point, Cleave recalls a stalled session with a therapist whose diagnosis is that he is overwhelmed; in parallel, the writing expertly communicates that helplessness - the critical loss of coherence in the face of a sudden onrush of feeling. Paradoxically, words are all we have available to us to describe the indescribable, the loss of language - or of the connection with language - being a common complaint of the depressed and the psychologically dispossessed. </p> <p> Eclipse avoids the doomy territory of the morality tale by its constant playfulness, and by maintaining a certain degree of detachment that, at times, infects the reader with its own ennui. Yet just as Cleave is prone to portentousness, seeing in the dazed scamper of a roadside animal the call home, or in the whirl and screech of seagulls his own family dramas, the novel is not without its message. At its close, the protagonist is summoned back to life by a vast, external event and the past, if not quite yet another country, is temporarily sidelined. Ghosts, it appears, can exist in the future as well as the past; whether or not we choose to respond to their beckoning is another matter.</p>",

The pair regard Cleave with a mixture of bemused concern and insolent tolerance, and their arrival on the scene, like characters in a Shakespearean subplot, provides humorous counterpoint to the would-be tragic hero's manic melancholia. Banville's handling of this strand of the novel is impeccable: the gruesome comedy of manners alternating with the painful impulse that prompts Cleave to take on, ineptly and disastrously, the role of paterfamilias. If the psychological wranglings of the situation are familiar - the unresolved detritus of childhood, the fruitless search for an authentic sense of self - then the language and tone in which they are conveyed makes them hard to recognise, not in the sense that they are unconvincing, but because the mental trauma they provoke is near impossible to unpick. \"Making strange\", in the idiom of Cleave's provincial town, is used to describe the upset of a frightened child when confronted by an unknown adult, and Cleave is indeed estranged from himself and from the world about him. Stranded in a past that has no use for him, he is plagued by delusion and suspended in a state of \"transcendent tipsiness\", an alienation that renders him both pitiful and monstrous. Banville's flighted prose, in which atmosphere is evoked through a dripfeed of lyricism, is superbly suited to his subject matter; his willed patience and defiant wordiness resonate with an almost unbearable sense of claustrophobia and the lurid excess of breakdown. At one point, Cleave recalls a stalled session with a therapist whose diagnosis is that he is overwhelmed; in parallel, the writing expertly communicates that helplessness - the critical loss of coherence in the face of a sudden onrush of feeling. Paradoxically, words are all we have available to us to describe the indescribable, the loss of language - or of the connection with language - being a common complaint of the depressed and the psychologically dispossessed. Eclipse avoids the doomy territory of the morality tale by its constant playfulness, and by maintaining a certain degree of detachment that, at times, infects the reader with its own ennui. Yet just as Cleave is prone to portentousness, seeing in the dazed scamper of a roadside animal the call home, or in the whirl and screech of seagulls his own family dramas, the novel is not without its message. At its close, the protagonist is summoned back to life by a vast, external event and the past, if not quite yet another country, is temporarily sidelined. Ghosts, it appears, can exist in the future as well as the past; whether or not we choose to respond to their beckoning is another matter.",

      "body": "<p> I like manifestos, gauntlets, red rags. It is necessary to assassinate some orchards, especially when those English gardens are full of people exclaiming what a \"vintage year\" it has been for fiction. Wyndham Lewis's phrase, \"Kill John Bull with art\", has always seemed a fine slogan. But the manifesto proposed by Matt Thorne and Nicholas Blincoe in this anthology of 15 stories seems more likely to kill art with John Bull. It flourishes the possibility of a new kind of fiction, but in fact it represents a kind of hidden shame about literature, and an embarrassment that fiction is not more like film. It is really a manifesto for the New Philistinism. Fortunately, the best contributors to this book ignore the editors' rules. </p> <p>Those rules are laid out in the form of a dialogue between Blincoe and Thorne. Gathering around them a group of writers in their late 20s and early 30s, they argue that \"new, exciting voices\" in recent contemporary fiction - generally men who, in the last three years, have written punchy novels with monosyllabic titles like Coast, Go, Seaside, Tourist, Corpsing - have been \"marginalised\". Blincoe and Thorne propose that the new fiction obey the following rules: it should be simple and \"avoid all devices of voice\", such as rhetoric and authorial asides, and shun \"poetry and poetic licence in all its forms\"; it should be plotty and forward-driving, and eschew flashbacks; it should be grammatically simple, and avoid elaborate punctuation; being a \"fragment of time\", it should be set in the present day; and all references to \"products, places, artists and objects\" should be \"real\". </p> <p>The first thing to observe is that if these writers - such as Alex Garland, Bo Fowler, Thorne himself, Toby Litt - have been marginalised, then their margin is our centre, because it is difficult to move in a bookshop without falling over some dictator-sized photograph of a slightly hooliganish figure, his hair as shaved as his prose style, his mouth set in a macho moue, his fine eyes focused on some suitably menacing abstraction in the middle distance. </p> <p>Second, one can hardly help agreeing that the editors, at least, should shun poetic licence, for when they indulge in it, the results are not good. Blincoe allows himself an unfortunate metaphor when he says that \"poetry is defined by metre - ultimately by the storm of jackboots\". (Heil H\u00f6lderlin!) Thorne, mixing a metaphor, suggests that \"the building blocks of storytelling should not be focusing on the minutiae of narrative but the grand plan\". (So those building blocks won't get too distracted.) </p> <p>Third, this manifesto is largely a list of prohibitions. Yet the great revolutions in literature - the Lyrical Ballads, naturalism, modernism - were fervent with proposal, and correspondingly eager to hit their enemies with those proposals. On both counts, Blincoe and Thorne are not revolutionaries: they admit to no apparent enemies, and they want literature to do less, not more. </p> <p>This quietism seems a mystery, but the clue is film. Blincoe and Thorne seem less goaded by the failures of British fiction than piqued by the success of cinema. And correspondingly, their response is not literary but cinematic. Blincoe says that flashbacks are \"essentially undramatic\", and Thorne concurs, adding that \"if the characters are strong, we need only know what they're doing now\". So: out with memory, because memory is undramatic. The model, the idol, is the linearity of film (though not, one presumes, the unlinearity of Antonioni, Bergman, Kurosawa, Ozu). </p> <p>Thorne says stories should shun \"poetry and poetic licence in all its forms\", because poetry is not the great influence on fiction: that is \"film, technology, music or television ... Today, fiction should be focusing on visual culture, and attempting to prove itself the equal of these mediums.\" This is a revealing slip, for Thorne must mean that fiction is not, at present, the equal of these mediums. The idea that literature might be superior, or simply engaged in a different kind of activity, has seemingly not occurred to Blincoe and Thorne. </p> <p>But then what can \"equal\" mean? Since it cannot mean \"the same as\" it must mean \"equally successful\". The manifesto for the New Puritanism is really a plea for success on the scale of film - a plea for worldly success wrapped in the disguise of denial. And a deep defensiveness, amounting to an embarrassment on behalf of literature, runs throughout this introduction. For what Blincoe and Thorne propose is to strip literature of all that makes it literary, so that it can better \"compete\" with film. It is really a commercial or pragmatic argument posing as an aesthetic and puritanical argument. </p> <p> So in a strange inversion, while Dogme 95, the Danish art-film movement on which this book is loosely modelled, set itself puritanically against Hollywood film, Blincoe and Thorne really want to embrace Hollywood, despite their avowed puritanism. They are friendly to precisely those simplicities that seem deadly to the founders of Dogme 95. </p> <p>Furthermore, while the rebellion of the Danish filmmakers makes sense within a world dominated by commercial cinema, the rebellion of Blincoe and Thorne is incoherent in a literary world already strongly infected by simplicity, presentism, blankness and a love affair with the cinematic. Thorne and Blincoe surely know that the contemporary short story since Raymond Carver - and as practised most recently by, say, Junot Diaz - has been quick, short, skinned and generally New Puritanical. Certainly in America, creative writing programmes process the story that only aspires to be a quick savage swipe of the cloth across reality. Such a story - invariably a \"fragment of time\", to use Blincoe and Thorne's phrase - offers itself as a kind of victim of its own confusion. Like many in this anthology, it is always narrated by a character, since third-person narration is nowadays taken to be something sent from an official ghost, like a bill. </p> <p>The contemporary short story is invariably written in a babyish or busted English of thoughtless simplicity. In its refusal to take much note of place, history, or society, it seems - like its characters - the victim of sensory deprivation. Its characters speak to each other, if they are into conversation at all, in stringy glazed abruptnesses. Their conversation, in its complacent discontinuity, sounds as if each participant were on the phone to a third party. If they have pasts at all, they are thinly offered. Instead, they seem oddly stunned by the present, deseeded and without the pith of affect. We do not see them change much; instead, the story photographs their stasis. </p> <p>This description of the contemporary story is also a description of the general tone of many of those in this anthology; which suggests that the New Puritans' revolution will not succeed precisely because it already has done. Pleasingly, the stories in this book that follow the \"rules\" are the weakest. \"Monkey See\" by Matthew Branton, about a policeman who watches hard-core porn as part of his job but who has not had sex with his wife for four months, seems to be an attempt to eat as many brand names as it can: \"I'll pop round Londis, get some Persil ... He cooked up a Sizzle and Stir ... He spooned some Gold Blend into a jug.\" The absurdity of the rule that demands that all references to objects be \"real\" is nicely exploded by Scarlett Thomas, who in her piece misspells H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, and by Thorne himself, who in his unpleasant and sexually sadistic story describes a woman in \"a blue Knicks baseball T-shirt\". The Knicks are a basketball team. </p> <p>Thorne says that \"fiction must always try to define the prominent cultural forms of its time\" (oh, like The Charterhouse of Parma, War and Peace, Middlemarch, To the Lighthouse). So what do these stories tell us about British society? That people are watching a lot of TV (ER is mentioned in two of the stories, The Bill in another) and American videos, that they are masturbating quite a bit, using or making pornography, taking drugs and listening to music. Mostly, they are doing \"simple\" things in \"simple\" prose: \"I shook my head and went into the kitchen, pouring myself a big bowl of cornflakes. I took a carton of juice from the fridge and filled a tall glass.\" Or: \"For dinner, Mark's mum has Chunky Monkey ice-cream. Me and Mark's dad have egg and chips, sitting in the lounge watching Neighbours From Hell.\" In these stories the unexamined life is decidedly worth living. </p> <p>The best stories are by Anna Davis (a lovely picture of a 15-year-old girl's frustrations: \"There's so much life here and none of it is mine\"); Geoff Dyer (a very funny and finely written piece about a Frenchwoman's bad trip); and Candida Clark (a rich, pleasingly old-fashioned bar-room anecdote, poetically rendered). These disobedient examples take plenty of poetic licence, indulge in all kinds of devices of voice, and are not especially simple in their grammar. Nicholas Blincoe and Toby Litt have written stories that are at least intriguing, and certainly plot-driven. But they both have trick endings, and their proper milieu seems to be Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected. </p> <p>Of course, the short story has historically tended toward the simple. I have a favourite line from Joyce's \"A Little Cloud\": \"He watched the scene and thought of life; and (as always happened when he thought of life) he became sad.\" Many stories by Chekhov, Verga, Joyce and the incomparably simple Pirandello follow Blincoe and Thorne's rules. But this is the simplicity of those who have known richness, and who are a little weary of congestion. Blincoe and Thorne, by contrast, are too poor too young; paddling in remnants, they are incuriously abandoning something they did not possess anyway. On the evidence of this book, we need a New Abundance. </p> <p> \u0095 James Wood's The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief, is published in paperback by Pimlico.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501017685,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>The intriguing premise often disappoints in the unfolding. Not so in Jean-Christophe Grang\u00e9's <strong> Flight of the Storks </strong> (Harvill, \u00a316.99) <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502453153,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>. Storks are inexplicably vanishing during their migration from north Europe to central Africa, and a young academic, hired to investigate by a elderly ornithologist, finds himself drawn into a bizarre journey of destiny and colonial rapacity. The speed with which the dilettante don takes to a life of murder and chase is the only questionable note in a first-rate thriller that barrels through Europe and the Middle East, into Africa and then India, blending the Gothic surrealism of Georges Franju's classic horror film Les Yeux Sans Visage (stolen body parts and weird, obsessive medical experiments) with the tropical depravities of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Recommended. </p> <p>Washington film critic Stephen Hunter has made a second career writing calibrated masculine thrillers dedicated to guns, which are detailed more lovingly than any woman. He draws heavily on film for inspiration, particularly Clint Eastwood as embodiment of the Puritan struggle and the flawed machismo and high fire-power of Sam Peckinpah. <strong> Hot Springs </strong> (Century, \u00a317.99) <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502451505,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> features his regular crack shot Earl Swagger, demon-driven and given to improbable heroics. Suffering post-second world war depression, Swagger gets back in the killing groove when hired to clean up an Arkansas gambling town. Hunter does a professional job, but this is coarser and more cartoonish than his best work, full of set-piece slaughter, pat psychology, twinkling villains and laughably stoic women. </p> <p>Like Hunter, George P Pelecanos is from Washington and has a film background. Unlike Hunter, he is an urban creature and spends more time describing natty shoes than guns; he also gives believable meaning to the trajectories of ordinary lives. The big mystery about <strong> The Big Blowdown </strong> (Serpent's Tail, \u00a310) <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502440985,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> is why it has taken four years to get published here when Pelecanos is widely regarded as one of the best young American writers, and when this novel is one of his best. Set in Washington between 1933 and 1959, The Big Blowdown plays mainly as a post-war blues about a homecoming gone wrong. As always with Pelecanos, the prose is just dandy; the story unfolds to the beat of the city and a jukebox of hits, with the emphasis on racial mix and the overlap of retail and criminal enterprise (Greek diners and protection rackets; bars and pimping). After half a dozen interlocking novels, Pelecanos appears to be producing one of the great contemporary bodies of work. </p> <p>Where Pelecanos is a writer of texture and ambition, Faye Kellerman offers little beyond formula and the odd chatty insight. The slack ease of the writing extends to lazy plotting that relies on coincidence and wild surmise. She also does a rotten red herring. </p> <p> <strong> Stalker</strong> (Headline Feature, \u00a317.99) <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502440574,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> doesn't really feature a stalker at all - more an inside case of unresolved police work that has a mustard-keen female rookie (irritating) trying to distinguish between regular departmental male chauvinism (irritating) and more specific harassment. Kellerman's bag is LA bland, and her political correctness comes at the expense of believable motivation. The villains are all routinely ugly. </p> <p>After her husband is stung to death by a bee, modest Anna discovers the extent to which his life and their marriage were built on lies. She also finds herself exposed to a fanciful obsessive who orchestrates her widowhood in increasingly creepy ways, encouraged at first by her masochism. Julie Parsons's <strong> The Courtship Gift </strong> (Pan, \u00a35.99) <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501021896,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> is set in a world of natural predators and victims whose initial curiosity serves merely to spring the trap. This Dublin tale is reminiscent of Ruth Rendell in its general nastiness, but her eye for how the ordinary turns extraordinary owes something to Patricia Highsmith, although Parsons is more Gothic in her liking for horror and twists and lacks some of Highsmith's relentless exposure of human motivation. </p> <p>Kathy Reichs is pretty much a push-button, middle-range formula writer, providing middle-class weekend reading. She rips off the Patricia Cornwell thing (females and forensics) and gives it a French Canadian twist with a Montreal setting - hence those cutely accented titles, which are getting more desperate: <strong> Deadly D\u00e9cisions </strong> (Heinemann, \u00a315.99) <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000064464,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>.

      "bodyText": "The intriguing premise often disappoints in the unfolding. Not so in Jean-Christophe Grang\u00e9's Flight of the Storks (Harvill, \u00a316.99) Buy it at BOL. Storks are inexplicably vanishing during their migration from north Europe to central Africa, and a young academic, hired to investigate by a elderly ornithologist, finds himself drawn into a bizarre journey of destiny and colonial rapacity. The speed with which the dilettante don takes to a life of murder and chase is the only questionable note in a first-rate thriller that barrels through Europe and the Middle East, into Africa and then India, blending the Gothic surrealism of Georges Franju's classic horror film Les Yeux Sans Visage (stolen body parts and weird, obsessive medical experiments) with the tropical depravities of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Recommended. Washington film critic Stephen Hunter has made a second career writing calibrated masculine thrillers dedicated to guns, which are detailed more lovingly than any woman. He draws heavily on film for inspiration, particularly Clint Eastwood as embodiment of the Puritan struggle and the flawed machismo and high fire-power of Sam Peckinpah. Hot Springs (Century, \u00a317.99) Buy it at BOL features his regular crack shot Earl Swagger, demon-driven and given to improbable heroics. Suffering post-second world war depression, Swagger gets back in the killing groove when hired to clean up an Arkansas gambling town. Hunter does a professional job, but this is coarser and more cartoonish than his best work, full of set-piece slaughter, pat psychology, twinkling villains and laughably stoic women. Like Hunter, George P Pelecanos is from Washington and has a film background. Unlike Hunter, he is an urban creature and spends more time describing natty shoes than guns; he also gives believable meaning to the trajectories of ordinary lives. The big mystery about The Big Blowdown (Serpent's Tail, \u00a310) Buy it at BOL is why it has taken four years to get published here when Pelecanos is widely regarded as one of the best young American writers, and when this novel is one of his best. Set in Washington between 1933 and 1959, The Big Blowdown plays mainly as a post-war blues about a homecoming gone wrong. As always with Pelecanos, the prose is just dandy; the story unfolds to the beat of the city and a jukebox of hits, with the emphasis on racial mix and the overlap of retail and criminal enterprise (Greek diners and protection rackets; bars and pimping). After half a dozen interlocking novels, Pelecanos appears to be producing one of the great contemporary bodies of work. Where Pelecanos is a writer of texture and ambition, Faye Kellerman offers little beyond formula and the odd chatty insight. The slack ease of the writing extends to lazy plotting that relies on coincidence and wild surmise. She also does a rotten red herring. Stalker (Headline Feature, \u00a317.99) Buy it at BOL doesn't really feature a stalker at all - more an inside case of unresolved police work that has a mustard-keen female rookie (irritating) trying to distinguish between regular departmental male chauvinism (irritating) and more specific harassment. Kellerman's bag is LA bland, and her political correctness comes at the expense of believable motivation. The villains are all routinely ugly. After her husband is stung to death by a bee, modest Anna discovers the extent to which his life and their marriage were built on lies. She also finds herself exposed to a fanciful obsessive who orchestrates her widowhood in increasingly creepy ways, encouraged at first by her masochism. Julie Parsons's The Courtship Gift (Pan, \u00a35.99) Buy it at BOL is set in a world of natural predators and victims whose initial curiosity serves merely to spring the trap. This Dublin tale is reminiscent of Ruth Rendell in its general nastiness, but her eye for how the ordinary turns extraordinary owes something to Patricia Highsmith, although Parsons is more Gothic in her liking for horror and twists and lacks some of Highsmith's relentless exposure of human motivation. Kathy Reichs is pretty much a push-button, middle-range formula writer, providing middle-class weekend reading. She rips off the Patricia Cornwell thing (females and forensics) and gives it a French Canadian twist with a Montreal setting - hence those cutely accented titles, which are getting more desperate: Deadly D\u00e9cisions (Heinemann, \u00a315.99) Buy it at BOL.

Charles Lewington, speaking at the height of the fuel crisis, admitted the Conservative leader's appeal was too narrow to beat Tony Blair despite Labour's recent woes.

Mr Hague's fate was compared by Mr Lewington to that of the US Republican presidential contender Bob Dole, who lost to Bill Clinton four years ago. The concentration on issues such as Europe to shore up the Tories' core vote, he said, risked leaving Mr Hague appearing an extremist, thus frightening off Middle Britain. \"The next UK campaign may follow Clinton's 1996 campaign with its focus on emphasising deliverables and its attempt to paint Dole as an out-of-touch rightwinger,\" said Mr Lewington. \"Hague is younger and has more going for him than Dole. But he is going into a campaign with a euro-focused policy direction which leaves him as vulnerable to attack as Dole was in the 1996 campaign. \"I don't blame the Tories for adopting a core vote strategy, but I think it will be difficult for Hague to broaden his appeal from where he is currently positioned.\" Mr Lewington, who now runs his own PR company, spoke at a debate in London on UK and US political campaigning organised by BKSH, the government relations division of Burson-Marsteller. Stuck on or just below 30% in the opinion polls, the Tories have been dubbed the flatliners. Mr Hague hoped populist stands against \"bogus\" asylum seekers and for Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer jailed for killing an intruder, would boost his support, but they have left him looking opportunistic.",

The Sunday Times confirmed last night it had purchased British serialisation rights and expected to run extracts within weeks. Palace lawyers have been trying to pressure Mr Jephson not to publish but are understood to have been hamstrung because his confidentiality agreement was signed only in 1995, long after the couple separated, and was with the princess herself - another oversight by the royal household. Private negotiations over the book have been going on for two years but the royal lawyers recently dropped plans to proceed with an injunction. Making clear that the royal family had not yet seen the manuscript, their statement said: \"Whatever its possible content the book is likely to arouse fresh speculation about the life of the princess which can only be upsetting to the feelings of Prince William and Prince Harry and the princess's family.\" The announcement of the book coincided with Prince Harry's 16th birthday and the royal household's latest attempt to demonstrate that it is a functioning family, with the publication of portraits of the young prince leaning happily against his father's shoulder. Mr Jephson, 43, issued his own statement yesterday defending his decision to publish the book, which he described as truthful and balanced. \"I take full responsibility for my decision to write about my personal experience of HRH Princess of Wales between 1987 and 1996,\" he said. \"During her lifetime I was discreet and utterly loyal. Since her death I have been dismayed by the indiscriminate comment she has received, much of it inaccurate, some of it apparently intended to diminish her memory. \"This book is a truthful and balanced account and therefore intended as a service to the late princess and those who worked with her. \"As such it can be a protection for those who would be hurt by speculation about her character or motives in public life... when [the princes] read the book I am confident they will be reassured.\" American networks are showing considerable interest in his story. Mr Jephson has already filmed an interview with the ABC network's star presenter, Barbara Walters, outside Kensington Palace. John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times, said last night the newspaper had not been approached by the palace or its lawyers to head off publication. \"We have agreed a fee with Mr Jephson and will be publishing within the next few weeks,\" he said.",

The home secretary, Jack Straw, has held out against the change despite a campaign by the parents of the murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne for a \"Sarah's law\", modelled on the US \"Megan's law\", which would give parents access to details of sex offenders in their area. Mr Straw said he had considered some form of controlled access to the register but had concluded that this would not be possible and would not help to protect children. But Stuart Kuttner, managing editor of the News of the World, which had mounted a campaign for parents to have access to the register, said he would not rule out publishing more photographs, names and addresses of alleged paedophiles. In some US states, laws introduced after the murder of a Californian girl, Megan Kanka, allow names and addresses of paedophiles to be accessed through police websites or CD-roms in police stations. But in Britain police, probation and child protection agencies opposed the move, warning that it would risk driving paedophiles underground. Instead, police and probation services will be put under a new statutory duty to set up risk assessment and monitoring programmes for violent and sex offenders released into the community. To reassure the public, police will be able to publicise the measures they take to manage risk.

      "bodyText": "The embattled Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, yesterday announced he had ordered the arrest of the youngest son of the country's former dictator Suharto in connection with a massive bomb explosion at the Jakarta stock exchange on Wednesday that killed 15 people. The move shows that Mr Wahid is no longer willing to tolerate the escalating campaign to discredit him and destabilise the nation, which several ministers have publicly linked to Mr Suharto, who is defiantly refusing to appear at his corruption trial, claiming ill health. But some politicians said the arrest order shows Mr Wahid is becoming desperate, because it caught the police completely unawares. Some analysts believe Indonesia's first democratically elected president is merely attempting to deflect attention from his government's inability to solve numerous escalating crises. \"In the cabinet meeting yesterday, I ordered the arrest of Tommy Suharto in relation to the bomb case,\" Mr Wahid told worshippers at a Jakarta mosque after Friday prayers, adding that Habib Alwi al Baaqil, the leader of the Islamic Concern Forum, a militant group with close links to the former president, should also be arrested. Mr Wahid stressed this does not mean the men are automatically guilty. \"But we regard there as being enough evidence to arrest them,\" he said. Officers at the national police headquarters said they had not been informed of the decision. \"Before we arrest anyone, we need to gather enough evidence,\" the national police spokesman, Brig Gen Dadang Garniga, said. Later, the police confirmed they had summoned Tommy Suharto, 38, whose real name is Hutomo Mandala Putra, for questioning. Jakarta has been rocked by bombs in recent weeks, including one on the day before each of the first two hearings of the corruption trial of Suharto. Another exploded at the attorney general's office hours after Tommy Suharto had been questioned in connection with a corruption investigation. Tommy Suharto made a fortune during his father's regime, but once the retired general was ousted in May 1998 the fortunes of the former playboy - who once owned half of the luxury carmaker Lamborghini - declined rapidly.",

An injunction preventing fishing fleets from trawling in areas off the Alaskan coast has drawn the governor of Alaska into an angry row with environmentalists who say they have been forced to resort to the law to save a dying species. The dispute is among a growing number of such clashes as commercial fleets compete aggressively for diminishing harvests around the world. The number of Steller sea lions in the Alaska region has fallen by 80% in the last 35 years, from 230,000 in 1965 to 34,000 now. Measuring 10ft in length and weighing more than a tonne, the sea lions require huge quantities of fish to survive and their decline has accompanied a rise in the catch numbers of pollock - a main source of fish served in fast food restaurant chains - on which the sea lions depend. The national marine fisheries service (NMFS) has a duty both to protect such species and the interests of the fishing industry. It is what has been judged in court as a failure to carry out the former function that has prompted the action by the environmentalists.

      "bodyText": "A tycoon who decided to support Labour when it promised to change the quarantine laws is putting \u00a32m into the first of the government's city academies. Frank Lowe, chairman of the Lowe Group and Octagon sports marketing, will join the board of governors of the city academy being set up on the site of Willesden high school, north-west London, which was failed by Ofsted inspectors two years ago. He will fund a fifth of a \u00a310m renovation, with the rest of the money coming from the government. He said yesterday that he hoped some of his clients, who include tennis player Anna Kournikova and footballer Gareth Southgate, would visit the school. He is planning a trip for the school to the world superbike championships at Brand's Hatch. Mr Lowe, 59, said he had backed Labour at the election because the party, unlike the Conservatives, gave a firm commitment to change quarantine regulations. He wanted his family to be able to bring their dogs back to the UK from his home in Switzerland. \"I am not very political,\" he said. He was telephoned six months ago by Andrew Adonis, the prime minister's education adviser in the Downing Street policy unit, and asked if he would be interested in funding a specialist sports academy. Mr Lowe, the son of an RAF officer and an opera singer, spent much of his early life in Manchester before attending Westminster school. His mother has lived in Brondesbury Park, near the academy site, for nearly 40 years. He plans to rebuild the basketball courts and playing fields, and experts from his company have been to the school to upgrade its computers. \"I started off with the idea that I have been fortunate in my life in terms of business ... I thought, wouldn't it be nice to do something for others?\" he said. \"There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that education is the most important thing for our country.\" Mr Lowe described the new head teacher of Willesden high, Frank Thomas, as terrific, adding: \"I have no knowledge of education in the sense of how to run a school, but I might be able to help, I might be able to inspire a few of the children.\" He said he was mystified by criticism of the city academies, which David Blunkett, the education secretary, said yesterday would be funded by a mixture of private and central government money. The academies will be put outside local authority control and take on charitable status, with a private board of governors that will set the salaries and conditions of staff. There would be two more city academies in Lambeth, south London, and in Liverpool, but in both cases plans were at an early stage. Three more will be announced by the end of the year. In Lambeth CfBT education services, a charity, is in discussion with the council over injecting finance but has not yet decided how to do so. In Liverpool the Anglican bishop, James Jones, said the diocese was interested in setting up a city academy, although a site had not been found. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"After six months the government has got one plan to have the building completed by 2002, and others announced in such a vague way that it is of no benefit to anyone.\" City academies will be allowed to select up to 10% of pupils on ability.

The environment agency says councils might have to triple their flood defence budgets to prevent the low-lying Somerset levels and other parts of Somerset becoming swamped. In a paper to be discussed by the local flood defence committee next week, the agency estimates that councils could face a \u00a370m bill over the next 10 years. Somerset county council and North Somerset council will have to decide whether they can ask local council tax payers to foot the bill. About one fifth of the area is at or below sea level and is surrounded by five ranges of hills which drain into the levels. Seventy miles of coastline run along the Severn estuary, which has the world's second highest tidal range. The area has been hit by severe floods in 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999 and this year, and the report acknowledges that opinion is divided on how much of the problem can be blamed on climate change.

Another (above) shows a figure crouched by a window shattered by bullets, and in a third (bottom right) a mother weeps as she sits on a pile of rubble with her baby. The negatives were found by Guardian staff photographer Don McPhee in the darkroom in the Manchester offices shared by the Manchester Evening News and the Guardian. \"The darkroom is to be closed because modern digital photography does not require old-style developing and printing techniques,\" he said yesterday. \"I was having a last nostalgic look round and found the box of glass plate negatives on the floor. \"I picked them up, still in their protective paper wrapping, and was amazed. The clothes gave away the age of the pictures but their quality matches that of any taken in a contemporary conflict.\" \"He was a great photographer who taught me a lot,\" said Bob Corfield, who worked for the Manchester Evening News for 50 years. \"He had a knack of always being in the right place at the right time. He photographed the Irish uprising in 1916 and also attempts to raise the Thetis, the submarine which was stranded on the seabed off the North Wales coast in 1939.\" Corfield remembers Doughty as \"short, stocky and slow-moving\". But Bob Smithies, a Guardian staff photographer from 1955 to 1974, says he was a lively man who always wore a trilby hat. \"I remember those pictures from Easter 1916,\" said Smithies. \"When I worked as a boy in the Evening News darkroom, I had to sit and file negatives in a freezing warehouse and those negatives were among them. \"I particularly remember the picture of the soldier by the broken window. It's magnificent. \"Walter was a delightful man. He taught me a lot and said I ought to be a Guardian photographer. He also built his own cameras and particularly wanted one for taking architectural pictures. He needed a super wide-angle lens and persuaded Zeiss to build one to his design. It cost\u00a32.50. \"He invented a developer which we used for donkey's years. \"It was my job to mix it and it was so rapid that you could develop a negative in a minute - 45 seconds if you used flash. \"In the old days he used to travel by motorbike. But in later years he had a car, and terrorised reporters because he drove so fast.\" \u0095 Left A Bit!, Photographs from the Guardian, runs at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery until November 26",

      "bodyText": "Train operating companies were yesterday warned to get on with fitting data recorders or automatic warning systems in drivers' cabs, following the Southall train crash three years ago. The health and safety commission said it would ask the government to legislate and make the companies act if they failed to speed up the process. Bill Callaghan, the commission's chairman, said it would not hesitate to intervene \"if commitments are broken or timetables slip.\" He assured families of the seven killed and 139 injured in the crash that safety improvements drawn up subsequently would be vigorously pursued. Legislation would be introduced where promises could not be delivered. The commission is furious at the failure to install data recorders. The Southall report said that this should be achieved by 2002, but the companies say that it cannot be done before 2005. The Association of Train Operating Companies said an independent report found that 2002 was too drastic, requiring \"a massive withdrawal of the fleet at any given time, leading to huge delays and considerable overcrowding\". The commission is also watching progress on automatic warning systems, whose failure was a contributory cause of the crash. Passengers on the train, and at the Paddington crash last year, complained about some of the emergency evacuation equipment, particularly hammers for breaking windows. The commission is arguing with some companies, which say hammers are sometimes used by vandals to attack passengers or damage trains. Central Trains, based at Birmingham, has withdrawn them.",

We in Britain should take the threat more seriously of collision with large rocks from space. </p> <p>Last December 30, lost among the millennium celebrations, Lord Sainsbury announced the formation of a top-level task force consisting of Sir Crispin Tickell, Dr Harry Atkinson and Professor David Williams, to investigate the asteroid hazard. Their report is due to be published on Monday. They are to confirm that the hazard we face is not trivial, and to recommend a suite of actions that the UK might implement, as a participant in a global programme aimed at ensuring that we are not taken unawares. </p> <p>Although the US is by far the dominant player in this field, the UK is well placed to lead European efforts to tackle this surprising danger. We must secure the future of the human race against attack from above. </p> <p>We have got all our eggs stored in one basket. It's called the Earth. We must keep it safe. The dinosaurs couldn't see their nemesis coming. We can, and having realised the danger it would be negligent of us to adopt an ostrich-like stance. </p> <p>Forget, for the moment, Bruce Willis and the other heroes of those cosmic disaster movies Armageddon and Deep Impact. The way the universe really works is this. In our yearly orbit around the Sun, many space rocks pass us by. Some are large, some small. Some come near, but most keep their distance. The Earth collects about 40,000 tons of celestial debris each year, mainly tiny grains producing the familiar shooting stars seen on a dark night. But every so often a whopper slams into us. </p> <p>Of concern are those bigger than about a kilometre: maybe a mile at the outside. A crater 10 miles wide and several miles deep would be excavated by one of these. By dint of the extreme speed, the energy released on impact would be equivalent to about 100,000 megatons of TNT. Around 10m times the Hiroshima bomb. </p> <p>This is the threshold at which a global upset of the environment would be caused (putting it mildly), and we may expect at least a quarter of the human race to perish. How often might that happen? Answer: about once every 100,000 years. </p> <p>Now, is that anything to be concerned about? As a scientist, I have to compare it against other risks. If the kill-rate is one in four people, the chance of dying that way is one in 400,000 per annum. If you have a remaining life expectancy of 40 years, this means there is a one in 10,000 probability that an asteroid catastrophe will end your days. Statistics for airline disasters indicate that the average westerner's chance of dying in a plane crash is around one in 30,000. So asteroids are more dangerous than jetliners. We spend billions on the latter, and essentially nothing on the former. </p> <p>Compare the risk against other major catastrophes, such as nuclear power stations or chemical plants exploding. The government has safety guidelines for such things. Take that one chance in 100,000 per annum level of occurrence as reference: the guidelines say that if some accident has that likelihood and it would kill more than 100 people, then money should be spent if it is feasible to reduce the risk. If the death expectancy is more than 10,000, then the risk is defined as being \"intolerable\", and it must be tackled. </p> <p>A massive asteroid impact anywhere around the globe has that annual probability, and no matter where it hits one may expect more than 10m Britons to die. The safety guidelines indicate, then, that this is super-intolerable. The government must act. </p> <p>The average voter still thinks people such as I are joking when we argue that there is a significant hazard posed by asteroids running into the Earth. Bruce Willis has fooled you. As a matter of fact, it is about as funny as cancer, or mass murder. Not to realise that some things are dangerous without having it painfully proven to you is dumb. Hydrogen bombs have never killed anyone. But we can imagine the consequences of a war in which they are used in anger. </p> <p> What can we do, having recognised the danger? All that is advocated at this stage is a surveillance programme aimed at answering one question: is there a major impact due within the next century? Most likely the answer is \"no\". </p> <p>It is like taking out car insurance: you hope you won't need to make a claim. But if the answer is \"yes\" then, with adequate warning, we can take ameliorative action. The only viable method we know to divert an identified impactor involves nuclear weapons, but it is not like in the movies. We are talking here about having 10 or 20 years to get out there and give it a small but sufficient nudge such that it misses our planetary home, and does not deliver its far more powerful punch. </p> <p>The parallel with cancer is a pertinent one. Cancer screening costs relatively little and most often the result is negative. But if a tumour is found, then all the feasible cures are unpleasant, and they may only be used if the cancer is picked up early enough. And you won't find it if you don't look. </p> <p>Ah, but you have never heard of anyone dying due to an asteroid strike? No, there have been no really large impacts during recorded history. Of course not. You wouldn't be here to read about it if there had been. But there was a 15 megaton event over Siberia in 1908 that would have flattened the whole of London if the circumstances had been only slightly different. And Chinese records tell us of a meteorite explosion killing tens of thousands in the 15th century. </p> <p>Statistics can be misleading. Take air crashes. I'm a member of the Qantas frequent flyer club, an airline that has never had an accident. Does that mean that next time I board a Qantas jet to Sydney I have zero risk of dying? Circumstances can change quickly. Until recently Concorde was regarded as a paragon of air safety. Two decades ago virtually everyone, weather forecasters included, thought that hurricanes never hit England. </p> <p>The only nation spending any sensible amount on asteroid defence is the United States. And I do mean \"defence\" - the two most productive search telescopes are owned by the US Air Force. In effect we too, need to declare war on the heavens. </p> <p> Duncan Steel is reader in space technology at the University of Salford. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:D.I.Steel@salford.ac.uk  \">D.I.Steel@salford.ac.uk </a></p>",

We spend billions on the latter, and essentially nothing on the former. Compare the risk against other major catastrophes, such as nuclear power stations or chemical plants exploding. The government has safety guidelines for such things. Take that one chance in 100,000 per annum level of occurrence as reference: the guidelines say that if some accident has that likelihood and it would kill more than 100 people, then money should be spent if it is feasible to reduce the risk. If the death expectancy is more than 10,000, then the risk is defined as being \"intolerable\", and it must be tackled. A massive asteroid impact anywhere around the globe has that annual probability, and no matter where it hits one may expect more than 10m Britons to die. The safety guidelines indicate, then, that this is super-intolerable. The government must act. The average voter still thinks people such as I are joking when we argue that there is a significant hazard posed by asteroids running into the Earth. Bruce Willis has fooled you. As a matter of fact, it is about as funny as cancer, or mass murder. Not to realise that some things are dangerous without having it painfully proven to you is dumb. Hydrogen bombs have never killed anyone. But we can imagine the consequences of a war in which they are used in anger. What can we do, having recognised the danger? All that is advocated at this stage is a surveillance programme aimed at answering one question: is there a major impact due within the next century? Most likely the answer is \"no\". It is like taking out car insurance: you hope you won't need to make a claim. But if the answer is \"yes\" then, with adequate warning, we can take ameliorative action. The only viable method we know to divert an identified impactor involves nuclear weapons, but it is not like in the movies. We are talking here about having 10 or 20 years to get out there and give it a small but sufficient nudge such that it misses our planetary home, and does not deliver its far more powerful punch. The parallel with cancer is a pertinent one. Cancer screening costs relatively little and most often the result is negative. But if a tumour is found, then all the feasible cures are unpleasant, and they may only be used if the cancer is picked up early enough. And you won't find it if you don't look. Ah, but you have never heard of anyone dying due to an asteroid strike? No, there have been no really large impacts during recorded history. Of course not. You wouldn't be here to read about it if there had been. But there was a 15 megaton event over Siberia in 1908 that would have flattened the whole of London if the circumstances had been only slightly different. And Chinese records tell us of a meteorite explosion killing tens of thousands in the 15th century. Statistics can be misleading. Take air crashes. I'm a member of the Qantas frequent flyer club, an airline that has never had an accident. Does that mean that next time I board a Qantas jet to Sydney I have zero risk of dying? Circumstances can change quickly. Until recently Concorde was regarded as a paragon of air safety. Two decades ago virtually everyone, weather forecasters included, thought that hurricanes never hit England. The only nation spending any sensible amount on asteroid defence is the United States. And I do mean \"defence\" - the two most productive search telescopes are owned by the US Air Force. In effect we too, need to declare war on the heavens.

With the lure of an introduction fee of \u00a33,000 or \u00a35,000 for director-level hires, UBS Warburg pleads: \"Help us to get those shoes filled\". The shoes, pictured on colourful postcards placed on each employee's desk in the City and other major financial centres around the world, advertise the group's new internal website, ihire. In a reflection of a highly-competitive job market in the City, Warburg launched the campaign to persuade its existing employees to recommend candidates last week. While other investment banks, such as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, already pay introduction fees to its staff, few financial firms have adopted such a recruitment drive. Investment banks have traditionally used headhunters - who can demand up to 20% of the first year's salary for an introduction fee - to find new staff, ranging from specialists in investment banking to share salesmen. Warburg describes the ihire scheme as one that \"rewards you for helping to bring the right people into your organisation - people who fit\" and adds: \"It'll make your social life easier to plan too\". While some bankers might be concerned that if their friends are sitting alongside them it will more difficult for them to get out of the office, Warburg promises that the best will bring further rewards. \"The better our people, the better we are at what we do.

When Salman Rushdie published a book about rock singers, The Ground Beneath Her Feet, accompanied by a pop CD, the critics were divided; those in favour often acclaimed the book for what one suspects were not purely literary reasons.\" Sutherland published a gushing review of the book. He clearly recognised himself as an example of the ingratiating, youth-worshipping new establishment bufferdom I had in mind. George Walden London",

But some who knew Kujau in his many guises - he used at least eight aliases and followed 10 occupations - may still wonder whether the man nicknamed \"the professor\" might still be around somewhere, having pulled off his last grand sting.</p> <p>Kujau's place in 20th-century history was assured in April 1983, when the Sunday Times and the German magazine, Stern, announced the publication of extracts from 62 volumes of Hitler's diaries, supposedly covering the entire history of the third reich, from 1933, when the National Socialist party took power in Germany, to its ignominious end in 1945.</p> <p>They had been unearthed by a Stern employee, Gerd Heidemann, in a journalistic coup that made him the envy of colleagues everywhere. The Sunday Times coverage of the story began on page one and ran to four inside pages. There were photographs of Hitler, his mistress Eva Braun, and fellow Nazi leaders Goebbels, Himmler and Bormann, with extracts from the diaries themselves, all under the headline \"world exclusive\".</p> <p>Less than two weeks later, however, the diaries were unmasked as forgeries. Relatively simple scientific tests, conducted by the West German federal archives, showed that the paper and ink used in the preparation of the diaries had been manufactured at least eight years after Hitler's death.</p> <p>Reputations began to tumble rapidly. The first to suffer was Heidemann. He turned out to be a researcher, rather than a journalist. He ran in neo-Nazi circles, had had an affair with Goering's daughter, gave parties for leading ex-Nazis, and collected Nazi and other military memorabilia - he even boasted of having acquired Idi Amin's underpants. Crucially, when he had persuaded Stern's management to lay out nearly \u00a31m to buy the diaries, no one had thought it necessary to tell the magazine's editors. So, in an attempt to save him self, Heidemann had to reveal how he had located his priceless material - and the extra- ordinary figure of Konrad Kujau moved on to the international media stage.</p> <p>A short, roundfaced man with a drooping moustache, he was born in the Saxon town of Loebau, 40 miles from Dresden, in what became East Germany. His father, a shoemaker, was an ardent Nazi supporter until his death in 1944. Konrad was brought up in a series of children's homes, fled to the west in 1957 and drifted into a world of casual labour and petty crime.</p> <p>His biography is written in his police record, although there is no certainty that even this is correct. Kujau had the ability to confuse his police interrogators with stories packed with such apparently authentic detail that they believed him until their investigations proved them false. Then, unfazed, he would start all over again with another, equally false, story.</p> <p>Gradually, however, two previously hidden talents surfaced in his life. First, he could paint. Nothing he did was original, and he had no style of his own, but he could copy a painting almost exactly. Second, he could forge almost anything, particularly other people's handwriting. His first conviction for forgery was for counterfeiting 27 marks' worth of luncheon vouchers. Then, in the mid-1970s, he had the brilliant idea of combining his two talents into a scam, which - if only he had not become too greedy - could have kept him financially comfortable for the rest of his life.</p> <p>Hitler himself had been an industrious amateur painter; it has been estimated that he turned out some two to three thousand drawings, paintings and sketches. So Kujau began creating paintings in Hitler's style, attaching to them a forged letter or certificate confirming their authenticity. For example, on the back of a large painting of German infantrymen in France during the first world war, he forged a note, in Hitler's handwriting, saying: \"I painted this picture in memory of the comrades who fell in the field.\"</p> <p>In truth, the authentication notes were crude and the paper was modern - Kujau achieved the aged appearance by pouring tea over it. But we must assume that he had taken into account an important psychological factor, and one that would surface again in the Hitler diaries fraud: the power of secrecy. He knew that his customers felt guilty about their purchases, that collections of Nazi memorabilia were kept secret and that, therefore, no one would take his forgeries to experts for checking. The next step must have appeared logical - if paintings and notes, why not diaries?</p> <p>According to Kujau, it was not until 1978 that he sat down and, using an official Nazi party yearbook for 1935 as a source, began to write, in Hitler's handwriting, a diary for the period. But Kujau's American agent told the writer Gitta Sereny, then with the Sunday Times, that he had handled \"unbound sheets\" of Hitler's writing supplied by Kujau as early as 1976. What Kujau could not have known was that one day a gullible fool like Heidemann would turn up on his doorstep, having heard about the diaries - and then offer him \u00a32.5m of Stern's money for them.</p> <p>When it happened, he did not, of course, reject the approach. And, once the offer came, he worked long hours churning out diary after diary, on the understanding - naturally - that Heideman would never reveal that he was the source.</p> <p>It was this corrosive secrecy that led to the Sunday Times being fooled. Everyone connected with the paper's deal with Stern, to publish the diaries in English, had to sign confidentiality agreements. The historian, Lord Dacre of Glanton (formerly Professor Hugh Trevor-Roper), engaged by the paper's new proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, to authenticate the diaries, complained after the scandal broke that, had he not signed such an agreement before he was allowed to inspect the diaries, he would have been able to consult his German colleagues - and the fraud would have been revealed. As it was, he at first said the diaries were \"an archive of great historical importance\", then, when he had more time to think about it, did a 180-degree turn.</p> <p>It was all too late. Both publications apologised. Heidemann and Kujau went on trial and were jailed. When Kujau emerged three years later, he became a media celebrity, selling his life story and appearing on television. He opened a gallery of forgeries in Stuttgart, which did quite well, but he could not resist a little forging on the side, and was arrested and fined \u00a32,000 for creating false driving licences.</p> <p>When he fell ill, he opened another gallery in Majorca to fund his treatment. Germans on holiday would seek him out and persuade him to demonstrate his skills.

      "body": "<p>Gillian Wearing's art makes Britain look like a place of benign lunacy, a country where there should be a big sign at the ferry terminal that says You Don't Have to Be Mad to Live Here, But it Helps. </p> <p>This maxim is the sort of thing you can imagine on one of the placards people hold in her celebrated photographic work Signs That Say What You Want Them to Say_ (1992-3). These deliberately roughshod pictures greet you in Wearing's retrospective in the Serpentine Gallery's imposing classical space. The sharply coloured photographs collide humorously with the gallery's whiteness. I'm Desperate, says the sign held by a young man in a suit. Southwark Council Hopeless, protests a woman in an alley. </p> <p>This first room of Wearing's solo show brings together the cream of the funny, disarming images that made her name and earned her the Turner prize in 1997. The video Homage to the Woman With the Bandaged Face Who I Saw Yesterday Down Walworth Road (1995) is best of all. Small, intimate and filmed with just the right amount of roughness, it tells how Wearing was so captivated by the sight of a confident, smartly dressed young woman walking down the street with her face entirely bandaged that she re-enacted it, bandaging her own face. Homage... is clever and moving. It points to great things, not just for Wearing but for British film-making: she seems to have hit on a new way of looking at things. You can see why she was so excited, dancing madly to music in her head in the middle of a shopping centre in her video Dancing in Peckham (1994). This collection of Wearing's early works confirms she was one of the real talents to emerge in the British art boom of the last decade. </p> <p>So what went wrong? A retrospective is a cruel thing but, in recent years, Wearing has taken the wrong road. Not just that, but the obviously, predictably wrong one: her work has become more monumental.

      "bodyText": "Gillian Wearing's art makes Britain look like a place of benign lunacy, a country where there should be a big sign at the ferry terminal that says You Don't Have to Be Mad to Live Here, But it Helps. This maxim is the sort of thing you can imagine on one of the placards people hold in her celebrated photographic work Signs That Say What You Want Them to Say_ (1992-3). These deliberately roughshod pictures greet you in Wearing's retrospective in the Serpentine Gallery's imposing classical space. The sharply coloured photographs collide humorously with the gallery's whiteness. I'm Desperate, says the sign held by a young man in a suit. Southwark Council Hopeless, protests a woman in an alley. This first room of Wearing's solo show brings together the cream of the funny, disarming images that made her name and earned her the Turner prize in 1997. The video Homage to the Woman With the Bandaged Face Who I Saw Yesterday Down Walworth Road (1995) is best of all. Small, intimate and filmed with just the right amount of roughness, it tells how Wearing was so captivated by the sight of a confident, smartly dressed young woman walking down the street with her face entirely bandaged that she re-enacted it, bandaging her own face. Homage... is clever and moving. It points to great things, not just for Wearing but for British film-making: she seems to have hit on a new way of looking at things. You can see why she was so excited, dancing madly to music in her head in the middle of a shopping centre in her video Dancing in Peckham (1994). This collection of Wearing's early works confirms she was one of the real talents to emerge in the British art boom of the last decade. So what went wrong? A retrospective is a cruel thing but, in recent years, Wearing has taken the wrong road. Not just that, but the obviously, predictably wrong one: her work has become more monumental. Her early work brilliantly used the texture of television. Dancing in Peckham is shown on a TV monitor; Homage..., though projected, is also televisual in scale. Wearing has a sculptor's eye for the figure, for framing a body in space, and when this is combined with genuine attention to other people, something magical happens.

In the manner of Henry V on St Crispin's Day, Tony Blair told us all to stop complaining and to \"seize the moment\", so we might say to ourselves with pride, \"This is our Dome.\" His appeal was effective. The Independent, a newspaper that had previously been sceptical, decided that praising the Dome was \"a far more testing intellectual challenge than going for easy, negative cynicism which so disfigures modern journalism\".

The Great Exhibition of 1851 had the interesting and comprehensible purpose of \"wedding high art with mechanical skill\", and it even made a small profit.

As Philip Norman, \"the historian of cool\", has written, all New Labour has tried to do is to duplicate the \"coolness\" of the 60s, but by government edict and with the \"sort of grim heavy-handedness we used to mock in the Germans\".

      "body": "<p>The 60s were not all they are cracked up to be. It was just that things looked different. And the look was invented, as it usually is, by the fashion trade, the print media, by models and those who style and photograph them, but dictated by money and whose pockets the money is in. </p> <p>Mid-20th-century man was either poor or he had a tailor. Model-man was Nigel on the knitting pattern, captured by the potting shed with his teeth clenched, his sartorial splendour dependent on his old mum's willingness to buy wool and have a stab at Fair Isle. His female equivalent, known as the mannequin, was a lady of indeterminate age and equine physicality, a highly cosmeticised parody of the sort of middle-class, middle-aged married woman thought to have the wherewithal to purchase cocktail frocks by the score. </p> <p>As the second half of the century shifted, as it were, its gear, we miraculously became young. The Pill, the proliferation of specialised further education and the erosion of class barriers produced a new generation of wage earners, which meant the young were now a market force. As though by imaginative design, the natural gawkiness of extreme youth replaced Nigel and his lady as an idealistic frame for the display of consumer goods. A new breed of iconographer emerged, superseding the elitist gentleman-portraitists of high-societal aspiration; working-class boys who could see in the darkroom, talked all any'ow, drove flash motors and used their cameras like penis extensions. </p> <p>What they produced was heady, sexy stuff, technically flawless and as limitlessly promising as the midnight chimes of Hogmanay. Glossy magazines became biblical in terms of the compulsion of their imagery and influence. The young believed in what they saw, as though they were looking into a mirror and recognised themselves as both real and invincible. It was no longer inevitable that they would replicate their parents in form or in content. They made the rules. They also made what the media were pleased to call the generation gap. They were on their own. And at the epicentre of their quasi- revolution were three photographers, David Bailey, Brian Duffy and Terence Donovan, a sort of holy trinity of modernity, unchallenged arbiters of all that is true and beautiful.</p> <p>The problem for those who innovate at sub-culture level, who literally make things look different, is that they tend to get impaled on their own cutting edge, enshrined for future decades in the awesome reputation of the cult they subscribed to. If you imply revolution, show that something that seemed to be indelible is washed out and something else has been born, you set a date for yourself and others. The higher you hoist your petard, the more unequivocal its salute, the quicker the imitators move in to date you. That is the nature of sub-culture. Bailey knew this, hung on and survived. Duffy knew it, fancied he heard the muffled march of the philistines coming to trample him and buggered off to pastures new before they came anywhere near. Donovan knew it and railed against it till the day he died. \"These are the 90s?\" he'd roar at anyone remarking upon the celebrity of his youth. \"That was then, this is now.\"</p> <p>It is questionable that he would have much relished the resurgences of his work in exhibitions and coffee-table collections since his death four years ago, all of which somehow serve to increase rather than mute the enigma of his personality. His widow Diana, his colleagues and their friends have collaborated to produce these memorials as though they themselves were looking for a better understanding of the man himself.</p> <p>The morning after his death was announced, with the chilling undertow of its self-infliction, five men counting themselves as members of his most intimate circle telephoned each other in utter consternation. Anyone else, they said one to another, one times five and five times one, anyone else but Donovan. They'd have understood if it'd been a man with observable volatility. Just not Donovan. Not in a thousand years. He was too controlled, too balanced, too centred in his own skin, too philosophical, the very obverse of a suicide. They say so to this day. The more astute of them conclude that, perhaps, he was simply unknowable, that the sweet, equable, funny, generous, diligent, well-mannered Terry they knew merely chose consciously to guard his private self from all-comers. There was nothing they could have done</p> <p>Diana Donovan prefers not to dwell on the circumstances of her husband's death. To this effect she raises a slender white hand, palm outwards, and affirms, in a curiously well-bred version of the Jerry Springer show vernacular, that she will not go there. Suffice it to say that one day she wandered into his studio and found him casually perusing colour transparencies and muttering \"every one a Bruegel\" as he dropped them in the bin, and another day she went there and saw that he was dead. Her devastation is her own affair. </p> <p>She has negotiated her own emotional survival by concentrating on the positive, happy aspects of her marriage and by immersing herself in the task of bringing the enormous diversity of Donovan's contribution to the visual arts to a forgetful public.</p> <p>Her account of their first meeting is succinct and quaintly illuminating. You have to imagine the pair of them. She wasn't a model, but she was pretty and tiny and blonde and very earnestly middle class, thrilled to have landed a job as picture editor for one of the many hopefully seminal glossies that came and went in the mid-60s. He was, well, he was Terence Donovan, the Terence Donovan; built like a brick outhouse, spoiled for choice sex-wise, unreconstructed East End accent, open-top Bentley with white-wall tyres parked outside, Savile Row suit all buttoned up, minions bearing equipment, the full monty. They wouldn't normally have afforded him, but he was a friend of the proprietor and a jolly nice bloke, and besides, they were saving on model fees by using the girls in the office. They combed their hair, did their lipstick and dressed up in raincoats and sou'westers and did what they were told. </p> <p>When the session was over he offered her a lift home. She thought that was rather splendid until they got to Knightsbridge and he said that's it, we're home. As she lived in Earl's Court at the time, she pointed out that it wasn't her home. No, he said, but it is mine. So she thanked him, got out of the car and took a bus the rest of the way. No, he didn't ask her in. No, definitely not. And no, she wasn't remotely offended. All gifted people are eccentric, she reasoned with the impeccable logic of one who would doubtless attribute ego-centricity to the same gesture by a non-gifted person. You had to accept it from such a great photographer. </p> <p>Years later she accepted the rules of their engagement in a similarly deferential manner. No holidays, he said to her. No shopping. Perfectly reasonable, she thought. She is particularly delighted with the episode of the graphologist. While debating with himself whether or not to propose marriage, he sneaked a recipe she'd jotted down in her kitchen and sent it off to a pal of his who interpreted handwriting for the edification of Scotland Yard crime-busters. </p> <p>The resultant report, ill-spelled and typed on a manual typewriter from which the bogeys had not been removed from the \"a\"s and \"e\"s, she continues to treasure as an intuitive and accurate character analysis of herself. It describes a young lady of exceptional taste and refinement, particularly good at colour matching; self-reliant, detached, practical, discreet, loyal and instinctual, an ideal partner for an artistic, enterprising, active man. It is anyone's guess what Donovan made of it; the western equivalent of a gentle geisha, perhaps, but at all events he popped the question, doubts dispelled.</p> <p>He was never nebulous about his expectations of her as a wife. \"Di-di\", he would say to her, it being his special name, \"Di-di, we are all alone in this world. You've got to learn to be alone.\" She didn't understand at first. Having been brought up to imagine that marriage meant an indissoluble togetherness, a belonging with and belonging to, she found it a little daunting to be thrown on her own resources while her husband spent his days in the exclusive company of the world's most beautiful and alluring women. It did not pass her by that her newly acquired husband might easily acquire a new wife. </p> <p>\"You've got to think about things, Di-di,\" he'd say. \"You've got to think things out.\" So she thought about it and concluded there wasn't much point in whining. \"Poor old Terry,\" she'd say, \"stuck in a studio all day with Celia Hammond/Jean Shrimpton/ Cindy Crawford/whoever. Ah well, somebody's got to do it.\"</p> <p>When their first child was imminent, he drove her to Queen Charlotte's Hospital, walked her into reception and drove himself home. There was never any question of him being there. No point in being sad about it, either. It was her business, childbirth. The doctor woke him from a deep sleep to tell him his son had been born. That was just the way he was. Horses for courses, sort of thing. She felt he wanted a family, wanted in some way to replicate the closeness of his childhood family group, with mum and dad downstairs, and Aunt Doll and Uncle Bill and Cousin Roy upstairs. Not that he saw that much of them. He was evacuated by himself to Devon during the war, his father was a long-distance lorry driver and his mum worked full time as a Woolworths floor walker and Cousin Roy was too old to be a companion.</p> <p>So he was very much a loner. He did his very best to train her, as she puts it, in the same mode. And she's grateful now, she really is. It wasn't always easy. Sometimes, she'd fly off the handle about something, get rattled and express anger. \"Hang on,\" he'd, say, \"let's get the right perspective on this. Let's get the whole picture. Let's not pretend it isn't what it is or it is what it isn't.\" And, of course, she'd sometimes feel like giving him a slap, but he was always right, always correctly focused.</p> <p>She never really understood his religious proclivities. Not then, anyway, perhaps a little more since his death. They didn't scrutinise each others' psyches, you see. He was a Zen Buddhist, she was Roman Catholic. These things are private, and besides, he always said there wasn't much difference between the two, apart from the guilt. So far as Diana was aware, he'd been to see The Seven Samurai at about the same time he did his National Service and came out of the cinema with an abiding passion for Japan and all things Japanese. It happened to a lot of people in the 50s. You either fell for La Dolce Vita or, if you were of a more deeply romantic, soulful stamp, Seven Samurai did it for you.</p> <p>Like all morality tales, it is about suffering humanity and what it takes to struggle through this vale of tears with some degree of dignity. The fact that orientals appear to have a different physical centre of gravity from ours, particularly noticeable when they're running about bashing each other with sticks, makes it all seem new and exotic, but the messages are all there, all the good old enduring, universal clich\u00e9s, writ large and bleak in subtitles beneath the seething paddy-fields of another time and another country.</p> <p>There is strength in unity. Selfishness makes you weak. Don't stew in your own juice. A problem shared is a problem halved. If you need help, ask for it. Defence is more difficult than attack. Choose your own battlefield. The enemy is as afraid of you as you are of him; use this against him. Courage is only an attitude you strike. Bravado is better than nothing. Pride goes before a fall. You can't win 'em all.

And Donovan was a black belt. The tenets of Zen are so amorphous, as much about what they're not as what they are, you are in danger of ballsing up any attempt to verbalise them. The original Buddha, bless him, never wrote anything down, he just sat there minding his own business until he was good and ready to go public with whatever part of his tangled web he was weaving. This probably accounts for the plethora of bastardised versions that prevailed in the 60s, vapid souls who imagined their personal path to enlightenment lay in expanding their self-consciousness, babbling about their innermost f-f-f-feelings and being bloody rude to everyone with their home truths.</p> <p>What was so difficult to assimilate was the yin and yang of it, the balance: the pesky fact that we are all huge bundles of contradictions, polarised monsters whose backs are always exactly and invariably as broad as our fronts.</p> <p>Top and bottom, though, it means we're supposed to try to be good. According to Diana, this was Donovan's avowed intent. He just wanted to be a good man, to help and not hinder his fellows. He would also argue ad nauseam with himself and with anyone who'd listen about the meaning of good. \"He could,\" Diana said with something akin to maternal pride, \"tie you in knots.\"</p> <p>Donovan was never ostentatious about his Buddhism. So far as Diana ever knew in their 28 years together, he didn't meditate so you'd notice, nor did he light incense sticks and make a song and dance at an altar, chanting and what have you. Every evening, though, he went to the Budakwai to practise his judo and just be in a safe place, nobody asking him to account for himself, a man among other men trying to up the grade of their judo belts, trying, literally, to better themselves. White belt, yellow belt, green belt, brown belt, black belt; all very Mickey-Mouse on the face of it, but it took hard work and dedication. </p> <p>The hierarchic structure of his chosen discipline made sense to him so there is no paradox in the fact he was politically Conservative. He adored Margaret Thatcher. His portrait of her owes something to Annigoni's highly romanticised painting of the young Queen Elizabeth; noble, heroic, yawningly portentous. He enjoyed her company and, unsurprisingly, she enjoyed his. He had all her party political broadcasts with no hint of cynicism. They got on together like a house on fire; the grocer's daughter and the lorry driver's son, escapees of obscurity, subscribers to the principle of \"If I can do it so can you and if you can't you have only yourself to blame.\"</p> <p>Donovan's value system was founded, like Thatcher's, on the Protestant work ethic, which is all the more potent for being tacit. Work hard, and you get rewarded; idle, and you don't. Pure pragmatism. Donovan had no patience with lazy students in his teaching days. Right, he'd say, anybody not feel like buckling down, sod off out of it. As the 70s and 80s dripped by and his profession was over-run with would-be Donovans, his scorn was boundless. Look at them, he'd say, running off 90 rolls of film in the hope that one of them will have a picture on it. Not one of them has seen the inside of a darkroom and most of the buggers don't know how to load a fucking camera. And he was right.</p> <p>There is nothing morally wrong with having the Midas touch in Zen ideology. In a way you're duty bound to make as much loot as you can so that you can redistribute it where it's needed. Terry would empty his pockets for anyone down on their luck, Diana says. He never passed a beggar on the street . . . Donovan made a great deal of money. His business ventures always came good and a quarter of a century spent making commercials for film and television made him a rich man by anybody's standards. His money wedge, he called it - as in \"You all right for wedge?\" - also defended him against disparagement.</p> <p>Once, while mooching around the National Portrait Gallery, he was greeted by an upper-class aesthete of his acquaintance. \"Why Terence,\" said the man, \"fancy seeing you here! I didn't know you were interested in this sort of thing.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not,\" Donovan replied, whipping out a hefty wedge. \"These are all the portraits I'm interested in.\" </p> <p>A lot of loyal friends felt that Donovan compromised his artistic integrity with so much commercial work. He always insisted he was a craftsman, not an artist. Perhaps he longed to be contradicted. His advertisements were technically brilliant, of course, they had the requisite style and punch, but they could always only be a triumph of form over content. And even a craftsman wants to say something louder than Wear Tuff Boots or Drink Guinness. His foray into feature film making was singularly unsuccessful. He made a movie about a Japanese spy in London. I haven't seen it. Very few people have. Those who had the privilege variously opine \"He was having a joke\", \"It was fantastically interesting\" and \"Crap\". Donovan had no option but to shrug it off. \"I believed in it,\" was all he ever said. He did not invite sympathy, nor did he get much. </p> <p>It is considered axiomatic that a man who gives the impression of being completely in control of himself is somehow immune to the anguish of disappointment. Particularly if he has a sense of humour. There was an unseemly hoo-ha, for instance, over his Robert Palmer promo. For this effort he gathered together a tribe of his favourite models, the thin but bosomy types who precursed the supermodel, dolled them up in next to nothing and had them zombying about like a bunch of identical, porny automatons. By way, I imagine, of ironic comment upon the socio-sexual mores of the pop scene. How would I know? At all events, those more deeply entrenched thereabouts than I took a certain umbrage. Surely this was insulting to women? Not only were they showing their bits, they were clearly inept musically since they weren't really playing their guitars.

What a load of wankers.\" But he had been right all along. These really were the 90s. During their course he privately - intensely privately - took himself back to the drawing board and embarked on the process of becoming what he always said he wasn't, an artist. As though laughing at himself before anyone could get a snigger, he was overtly shy and wry about it, but obsessive, earnest, perfectionist.

Diana Donovan remembers the day he sold a painting. It hadn't been for sale, none of them was, but an acquaintance saw it, liked it, wanted it and a deal was struck. It's a funny thing, Diana said, but she had never seen him so thrilled to have earned money in his life.</p> <p>In 1996, the year of his death, he was working for the glossies again, bad-mouthing picture-desk wankers and generally doing what came naturally. In his spare time he keyed in his word processor to capital letters and began to write. He planned a series of vignettes, apparently, to expose his thought processes to a wider public and have a bit of a laugh. In one of them, which he has archly entitled The Curious Power Of Yellow, he rails against the complacency with which the British have allowed their beautiful cities to be fouled up by madmen who rush about scribbling ugly yellow lines on our lovely streets. What has happened to our British fighting spirit? Are we fit only to be footie-drunks?

      "bodyText": "The 60s were not all they are cracked up to be. It was just that things looked different. And the look was invented, as it usually is, by the fashion trade, the print media, by models and those who style and photograph them, but dictated by money and whose pockets the money is in. Mid-20th-century man was either poor or he had a tailor. Model-man was Nigel on the knitting pattern, captured by the potting shed with his teeth clenched, his sartorial splendour dependent on his old mum's willingness to buy wool and have a stab at Fair Isle. His female equivalent, known as the mannequin, was a lady of indeterminate age and equine physicality, a highly cosmeticised parody of the sort of middle-class, middle-aged married woman thought to have the wherewithal to purchase cocktail frocks by the score. As the second half of the century shifted, as it were, its gear, we miraculously became young. The Pill, the proliferation of specialised further education and the erosion of class barriers produced a new generation of wage earners, which meant the young were now a market force. As though by imaginative design, the natural gawkiness of extreme youth replaced Nigel and his lady as an idealistic frame for the display of consumer goods. A new breed of iconographer emerged, superseding the elitist gentleman-portraitists of high-societal aspiration; working-class boys who could see in the darkroom, talked all any'ow, drove flash motors and used their cameras like penis extensions. What they produced was heady, sexy stuff, technically flawless and as limitlessly promising as the midnight chimes of Hogmanay. Glossy magazines became biblical in terms of the compulsion of their imagery and influence. The young believed in what they saw, as though they were looking into a mirror and recognised themselves as both real and invincible. It was no longer inevitable that they would replicate their parents in form or in content. They made the rules. They also made what the media were pleased to call the generation gap. They were on their own. And at the epicentre of their quasi- revolution were three photographers, David Bailey, Brian Duffy and Terence Donovan, a sort of holy trinity of modernity, unchallenged arbiters of all that is true and beautiful. The problem for those who innovate at sub-culture level, who literally make things look different, is that they tend to get impaled on their own cutting edge, enshrined for future decades in the awesome reputation of the cult they subscribed to. If you imply revolution, show that something that seemed to be indelible is washed out and something else has been born, you set a date for yourself and others. The higher you hoist your petard, the more unequivocal its salute, the quicker the imitators move in to date you. That is the nature of sub-culture. Bailey knew this, hung on and survived. Duffy knew it, fancied he heard the muffled march of the philistines coming to trample him and buggered off to pastures new before they came anywhere near. Donovan knew it and railed against it till the day he died. \"These are the 90s?\" he'd roar at anyone remarking upon the celebrity of his youth. \"That was then, this is now.\" It is questionable that he would have much relished the resurgences of his work in exhibitions and coffee-table collections since his death four years ago, all of which somehow serve to increase rather than mute the enigma of his personality. His widow Diana, his colleagues and their friends have collaborated to produce these memorials as though they themselves were looking for a better understanding of the man himself. The morning after his death was announced, with the chilling undertow of its self-infliction, five men counting themselves as members of his most intimate circle telephoned each other in utter consternation. Anyone else, they said one to another, one times five and five times one, anyone else but Donovan. They'd have understood if it'd been a man with observable volatility. Just not Donovan. Not in a thousand years. He was too controlled, too balanced, too centred in his own skin, too philosophical, the very obverse of a suicide. They say so to this day. The more astute of them conclude that, perhaps, he was simply unknowable, that the sweet, equable, funny, generous, diligent, well-mannered Terry they knew merely chose consciously to guard his private self from all-comers. There was nothing they could have done Diana Donovan prefers not to dwell on the circumstances of her husband's death. To this effect she raises a slender white hand, palm outwards, and affirms, in a curiously well-bred version of the Jerry Springer show vernacular, that she will not go there. Suffice it to say that one day she wandered into his studio and found him casually perusing colour transparencies and muttering \"every one a Bruegel\" as he dropped them in the bin, and another day she went there and saw that he was dead. Her devastation is her own affair. She has negotiated her own emotional survival by concentrating on the positive, happy aspects of her marriage and by immersing herself in the task of bringing the enormous diversity of Donovan's contribution to the visual arts to a forgetful public. Her account of their first meeting is succinct and quaintly illuminating. You have to imagine the pair of them. She wasn't a model, but she was pretty and tiny and blonde and very earnestly middle class, thrilled to have landed a job as picture editor for one of the many hopefully seminal glossies that came and went in the mid-60s. He was, well, he was Terence Donovan, the Terence Donovan; built like a brick outhouse, spoiled for choice sex-wise, unreconstructed East End accent, open-top Bentley with white-wall tyres parked outside, Savile Row suit all buttoned up, minions bearing equipment, the full monty. They wouldn't normally have afforded him, but he was a friend of the proprietor and a jolly nice bloke, and besides, they were saving on model fees by using the girls in the office. They combed their hair, did their lipstick and dressed up in raincoats and sou'westers and did what they were told. When the session was over he offered her a lift home. She thought that was rather splendid until they got to Knightsbridge and he said that's it, we're home. As she lived in Earl's Court at the time, she pointed out that it wasn't her home. No, he said, but it is mine. So she thanked him, got out of the car and took a bus the rest of the way. No, he didn't ask her in. No, definitely not. And no, she wasn't remotely offended. All gifted people are eccentric, she reasoned with the impeccable logic of one who would doubtless attribute ego-centricity to the same gesture by a non-gifted person. You had to accept it from such a great photographer. Years later she accepted the rules of their engagement in a similarly deferential manner. No holidays, he said to her. No shopping. Perfectly reasonable, she thought. She is particularly delighted with the episode of the graphologist. While debating with himself whether or not to propose marriage, he sneaked a recipe she'd jotted down in her kitchen and sent it off to a pal of his who interpreted handwriting for the edification of Scotland Yard crime-busters. The resultant report, ill-spelled and typed on a manual typewriter from which the bogeys had not been removed from the \"a\"s and \"e\"s, she continues to treasure as an intuitive and accurate character analysis of herself. It describes a young lady of exceptional taste and refinement, particularly good at colour matching; self-reliant, detached, practical, discreet, loyal and instinctual, an ideal partner for an artistic, enterprising, active man. It is anyone's guess what Donovan made of it; the western equivalent of a gentle geisha, perhaps, but at all events he popped the question, doubts dispelled. He was never nebulous about his expectations of her as a wife. \"Di-di\", he would say to her, it being his special name, \"Di-di, we are all alone in this world. You've got to learn to be alone.\" She didn't understand at first. Having been brought up to imagine that marriage meant an indissoluble togetherness, a belonging with and belonging to, she found it a little daunting to be thrown on her own resources while her husband spent his days in the exclusive company of the world's most beautiful and alluring women. It did not pass her by that her newly acquired husband might easily acquire a new wife. \"You've got to think about things, Di-di,\" he'd say. \"You've got to think things out.\" So she thought about it and concluded there wasn't much point in whining. \"Poor old Terry,\" she'd say, \"stuck in a studio all day with Celia Hammond/Jean Shrimpton/ Cindy Crawford/whoever. Ah well, somebody's got to do it.\" When their first child was imminent, he drove her to Queen Charlotte's Hospital, walked her into reception and drove himself home. There was never any question of him being there. No point in being sad about it, either. It was her business, childbirth. The doctor woke him from a deep sleep to tell him his son had been born. That was just the way he was. Horses for courses, sort of thing. She felt he wanted a family, wanted in some way to replicate the closeness of his childhood family group, with mum and dad downstairs, and Aunt Doll and Uncle Bill and Cousin Roy upstairs. Not that he saw that much of them. He was evacuated by himself to Devon during the war, his father was a long-distance lorry driver and his mum worked full time as a Woolworths floor walker and Cousin Roy was too old to be a companion. So he was very much a loner. He did his very best to train her, as she puts it, in the same mode. And she's grateful now, she really is. It wasn't always easy. Sometimes, she'd fly off the handle about something, get rattled and express anger. \"Hang on,\" he'd, say, \"let's get the right perspective on this. Let's get the whole picture. Let's not pretend it isn't what it is or it is what it isn't.\" And, of course, she'd sometimes feel like giving him a slap, but he was always right, always correctly focused. She never really understood his religious proclivities. Not then, anyway, perhaps a little more since his death. They didn't scrutinise each others' psyches, you see. He was a Zen Buddhist, she was Roman Catholic. These things are private, and besides, he always said there wasn't much difference between the two, apart from the guilt. So far as Diana was aware, he'd been to see The Seven Samurai at about the same time he did his National Service and came out of the cinema with an abiding passion for Japan and all things Japanese. It happened to a lot of people in the 50s. You either fell for La Dolce Vita or, if you were of a more deeply romantic, soulful stamp, Seven Samurai did it for you. Like all morality tales, it is about suffering humanity and what it takes to struggle through this vale of tears with some degree of dignity. The fact that orientals appear to have a different physical centre of gravity from ours, particularly noticeable when they're running about bashing each other with sticks, makes it all seem new and exotic, but the messages are all there, all the good old enduring, universal clich\u00e9s, writ large and bleak in subtitles beneath the seething paddy-fields of another time and another country. There is strength in unity. Selfishness makes you weak. Don't stew in your own juice. A problem shared is a problem halved. If you need help, ask for it. Defence is more difficult than attack. Choose your own battlefield. The enemy is as afraid of you as you are of him; use this against him. Courage is only an attitude you strike. Bravado is better than nothing. Pride goes before a fall. You can't win 'em all. Don't be a willing victim. Kill or be killed. Go down fighting. The next world is a very nice place; there are no bandits there. In effect it is the philosophy of the judo mat. And Donovan was a black belt. The tenets of Zen are so amorphous, as much about what they're not as what they are, you are in danger of ballsing up any attempt to verbalise them. The original Buddha, bless him, never wrote anything down, he just sat there minding his own business until he was good and ready to go public with whatever part of his tangled web he was weaving. This probably accounts for the plethora of bastardised versions that prevailed in the 60s, vapid souls who imagined their personal path to enlightenment lay in expanding their self-consciousness, babbling about their innermost f-f-f-feelings and being bloody rude to everyone with their home truths. What was so difficult to assimilate was the yin and yang of it, the balance: the pesky fact that we are all huge bundles of contradictions, polarised monsters whose backs are always exactly and invariably as broad as our fronts. Top and bottom, though, it means we're supposed to try to be good. According to Diana, this was Donovan's avowed intent. He just wanted to be a good man, to help and not hinder his fellows. He would also argue ad nauseam with himself and with anyone who'd listen about the meaning of good. \"He could,\" Diana said with something akin to maternal pride, \"tie you in knots.\" Donovan was never ostentatious about his Buddhism.

However, you are not really changing your life if you do; you're just chucking in your job, selling your house and sailing to the six continents. A much more profound change is having grapefruit for breakfast. Inviting fruit into your life, especially at breakfast-time, when you're at your weakest, is a much more difficult challenge, especially if you decide to wave goodbye to your sausage at the same time. </p> <p>Changing what you wear can also completely change your life. For example, if you've spent the past 10 years in thick corduroy trousers and then go out and buy a pair of cargo pants, you're suddenly going to feel very uncomfortable with folk music and ancient battle revivals.

However, you are not really changing your life if you do; you're just chucking in your job, selling your house and sailing to the six continents. A much more profound change is having grapefruit for breakfast. Inviting fruit into your life, especially at breakfast-time, when you're at your weakest, is a much more difficult challenge, especially if you decide to wave goodbye to your sausage at the same time. Changing what you wear can also completely change your life. For example, if you've spent the past 10 years in thick corduroy trousers and then go out and buy a pair of cargo pants, you're suddenly going to feel very uncomfortable with folk music and ancient battle revivals.

      "body": "<p><strong> The subject</strong> </p> <p>Properly: pesto Genovese. Paradoxically: Liguria's only world-renowned culinary export, but 'the one that most needs the local oil and basil' (Anna del Conte). Pathetically: a name applied to almost any coarse paste containing garlic.</p> <p><strong> The basics </strong></p> <p> 'Pesto may have become more popular than is good for it,' says Marcella Hazan. She's got a point. Pesto means pestle, as in mortar and... , which is how true pesto is made. Ingredients: basil, extra-virgin olive oil, Pecorino and/or Parmesan, and pinenuts.</p> <p><strong> The details</strong></p> <p>If you insist on authenticity (an over-rated virtue), you should eat pesto only in Liguria. Ligurian basil and oil are uniquely sweet, blah blah. So, if you shop in Stockport, must your life lack pesto? Naaah, especially if your garden is groaning with an end-of-summer basil-glut. Follow a good recipe; and use a food processor (cautiously), if you can't face that pounding.

      "bodyText": "The subject Properly: pesto Genovese. Paradoxically: Liguria's only world-renowned culinary export, but 'the one that most needs the local oil and basil' (Anna del Conte). Pathetically: a name applied to almost any coarse paste containing garlic. The basics 'Pesto may have become more popular than is good for it,' says Marcella Hazan. She's got a point. Pesto means pestle, as in mortar and... , which is how true pesto is made. Ingredients: basil, extra-virgin olive oil, Pecorino and/or Parmesan, and pinenuts. The details If you insist on authenticity (an over-rated virtue), you should eat pesto only in Liguria. Ligurian basil and oil are uniquely sweet, blah blah. So, if you shop in Stockport, must your life lack pesto? Naaah, especially if your garden is groaning with an end-of-summer basil-glut. Follow a good recipe; and use a food processor (cautiously), if you can't face that pounding. Follow Anna del Conte's shopping advice on pinenuts: 'Large and smooth, of a creamy ivory colour, and without any darker patches.' Use good oil.

      "body": "<p>In a small house in Los Angeles, an archaeological project is taking place - one that digs deep into the \"low end of American art\". For 25 years, artist Jim Shaw has built up an eclectic collection of American junk, including his unwieldy chef-d'oeuvre - a revered collection of thrift-store paintings by anonymous amateurs bought from American flea markets, secondhand stores and charity shops. </p> <p>Shaw is a laconic figure, deadpan even. As a serious diviner of popular culture, he would never be seen to laugh at these paintings, as might some spotty student ironist. \"For instance, I saw a book called something like Black Velvet Paintings: Those You Love To Hate,\" he says. \"I wouldn't dream of being that disrespectful to the thrift-store paintings.\" Instead, Shaw's eye finds oddball value in such items, alerting one to how the abandoned, tatty and kitsch can be amusing, but also strange, disturbing and possibly even mind-expanding. </p> <p>The 400-odd paintings have been rescued by Shaw from dusty obscurity. Now his collection is famous in the art world - an unlikely outcome for the work of these ingenue artists, who didn't have a clue they would one day be splashed over the world's art galleries. A few years ago Charles Saatchi wanted to buy the lot, but Shaw didn't then want to sell, feeling that it should be in an American museum, but now says that he is prepared to let the collection go. </p> <p>Shaw grew up in a small chemical-producing town called Midland, in Michigan, and as an adolescent was already exploring the decor detritus of middle America, going into the lucky dips that were the town's thrift stores. \"Back then, we could find stuff going back to the turn of the century,\" he says. \"Nowadays you'd be hard pressed to find things from before the 70s.\" Indeed: as any charity-shop hound this side of the Atlantic will attest, junk is getting poorer in quality. </p> <p>As a result of this rich early experience, Shaw's eye was weaned on the popular Americana of the period. \"When I was a kid, I was an avid collector of comic books. My parents were sick of it - they forbade me to have monster magazines. They didn't like the more lurid type of comic.\" But Shaw became mesmerised by the reject undergrowth of America's golden consumer age. He has called the thrift-store art project \"anthropology\" - insofar as it involves \"looking through the garbage of American culture\", and has become a kind of historian of the trash vernacular. </p> <p>As an artist, Shaw has drawn on this kind of material. His My Mirage took elements from pulp novels, posters, comics, records, and toy soldiers to create what the Los Angeles Times called \"a complete upchucking of the first 20 years of the life of a middle-class American boy born in the 50s\". Several of these things remain in his home, including phalanxes of toy soldiers on a mantlepiece, odd dolls and masks, and, in the kitchen, \"tiki\" exotica such as souvenir Easter Island heads. A vinyl-covered Salvation Army-salvaged piano is in the living room. \"It cost more to get it tuned than to buy it,\" he says. </p> <p>For a long time, Shaw was driven to collect \"anything strange\", particularly ceramics. But there eventually came a point at which he had to stop buying bulkier items and limit himself to two-dimensional objects such as books, records, paintings - partly due to space, partly because the tat had started to move into a secondary, collectors market. This is when he decided to build up his thrift-store painting collection. Exotic records by artists such as Esquival and Les Baxter were becoming hip among the lounge set. \"Then I realised that these paintings were unquantifiable. They were pretty strange, and no one else wanted them.\" </p> <p>He honed his aesthetic at CalArts - the same art school that produced angsty comic-strip artist Raymond Pettibone and sculptor Mike Kelley, best known for his scary use of secondhand stuffed animals, and long celebrated in the UK's art schools. With Kelley, Shaw had a band called Destroy All Monsters. </p> <p>After art school, he \"forgot to leave LA\", and has been here since 1976, ending up in the district of Highland Park since 1993, living in what is termed a \"craftsman\" house, built in the 1920s. \"For some reason, you see them a lot in the X-Files. It has lots of wood and built-in cupboards.\"</p> <p>These shelves and niches are ideal for the display of his weird knick-knacks, but there is only room for a fraction of his 400-strong painting collection on the walls of the house, and besides, it is not everyone's idea of everyday viewing: his wife, the artist Marnie Weber, has raised objections to living with daubs of spooky clowns and grinning cheerleaders. There are, however, still quite a few paintings in the house, crammed into recesses in the bathroom or wherever else they can fit. Some go back years. Headless Beat Girl With Paintbrushes Sticking From Head came from a thrift store in Eagle Rock, LA. The Nymphs, has had a place above the mantlepiece for seven years. </p> <p>Shaw gives his paintings very literal titles. Nude, Deer Head, Many Women And Dotted Line is typical; Man With No Crotch Sits Down With Girl is another, while Off-road Helmet Merges With Landscape stretched his descriptive ingenuity. The paintings are divided into arch sub-genres - Teenage Fantasies, Psycho Paintings, Beefcakes And Cheesecakes - into which they fit fairly neatly. Of course, these devices only serve to emphasise their strangeness. But while it taxes his curatorial skills, Shaw insists that the thrift-store painting project is not about finding unsung talent. \"That's a bit like the old question, 'Could Bing Crosby have sung opera?'\" he says. \"I don't know. Is it relevant?\" </p> <p>Crucially, Shaw makes few claims for the thrift-store artists. These are not marginal visionaries like the so-called \"Outsider\" artists; nor are they necessarily Sunday painters - the derogatory term used since the 19th century for dilettante amateurs. Yet the ones that he has chosen - and he has \"tended to be a little bit selective\" - hit a bizarre discord in the soul, and Shaw himself sees all kinds of societal tendencies in them. \"A lot of the more surrealist and expressionist paintings among them involve some sort of sinful activity,\" he says. \"There seems to be a lot of puritanism, shame and guilt involved.\" </p> <p>Shaw's project has artistic lineage. The search for the unschooled, the naive and raw in art has a pedigree throughout modernism, from Picasso marvelling at tribal masks to Jean Dubuffet's post-war search for \"Art Brut\"; literally \"raw art\", produced by the unschooled and marginal. Indeed, the elusive intellectual quest for authentic creativity can even be seen in the shaky needlework of Tracey Emin, and the work of certain American painters such as John Curran and Alex Katz, which look a bit \"thrift store\" in execution. In this context, Shaw's artists may be seen as genuine suburban primitives. </p> <p>Equally, such junk-shop finds form a part of the history of objets trouv\u00e9s and ready-mades - works found complete, and invested with status by the professional artist-discoverer. Upending this notion is a section in the archive labelled \"Inspired By Modern Art\". </p> <p>\"Dal\u00ed, Magritte and Van Gogh tend to be the biggest inspirations,\" he says. \"It's that adolescent thing of loving surrealism and expressionism.\" </p> <p>Few of the thrift-store artists have been in contact with Shaw, although one did phone him, having seen his work in Shaw's book, Thrift Store Painting. On one occasion, when the show was in Hawaii, someone recognised a painting she'd given to her sister in law, and which had ended up abandoned. \"I gave her the painting back,\" says Shaw. \"It turned out that her husband had told her to give up art.\" This tale of crushed creativity moved him, and he tried to encourage her to do more. </p> <p>It looks as if Shaw has started something big. There are now several thrift-store painting-type sites on the internet - galleries include Huge Gallery, PSB Gallery, Friendly Toast and the Museum Of Bad Art. And now there are British collectors, including Tim Burke, who is having a show of his own more modest collection of Brit-thrift paintings at Coins, a west London coffee house, which includes paintings of Princess Diana, Spitfires and pub interiors. \"They were abandoned,\" says Burke, \"like orphans that needed a new parent.\" </p> <p>With all this interest in modern folk art, the buyers may well amass to purchase Jim Shaw's historic slice of the American cultural underbelly. But even if they do, Shaw's work is not over. Like a frontiersman of taste, he is driven to \"keep collecting weird things\" </p> <p>\u0095 Jim Shaw's Thrift Store Paintings can be seen at the ICA, The Mall, London SW1 from September 28 to November 5.

      "body": "<p>The other evening at a supermarket, I slurped expensive, single-vineyard, Alsatian gew\u00fcrztraminer and guzzled freshly prepared sushi that was passing on a small conveyor belt. Several major developments in the British way of life are implied here, and they can be summed up by this expostulation: who on earth, 20 years ago, would have dreamed that any of these things would come to pass? </p> <p>The supermarket was a newly refurbished London branch of Sainsbury's, in an area famous for its au pairs and Porsches, and so we can take it that not every branch will be tarted up to the same chic level. But, given time, who knows? </p> <p>Sainsbury's, I presume, needs to develop enticing new avenues to compete with Tesco and face up to the revivified Asda, but in certain instances it is doing the old things better than anyone. Two of these instances are Muscadet and Chinon. Sainsbury's Classic Selection Muscadet Sevre et Maine 1999 (16 points out of 20, \u00a34.99) rates an 'Astonishing!' wine note. It is the highest rating Muscadet I've tasted in 20 years (after more or less writing off such wines as spineless rubbish). It has wonderfully minerally, sushi-knife-sharp fruit without tartness, and I am led to believe that, unlike raw fish on lumps of rice, it is available at most branches.</p> <p>Sainsbury's Chinon Domaine du Colombier 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), alas, is not, but it is, I am reliably informed, well distributed nevertheless (call 0800 632262 for details). This is the best vintage of this engaging cabernet franc for some years. It parades ripe cherries, slatey tannins and a lovely, bitter cherry/cobnut finish.

      "bodyText": "The other evening at a supermarket, I slurped expensive, single-vineyard, Alsatian gew\u00fcrztraminer and guzzled freshly prepared sushi that was passing on a small conveyor belt. Several major developments in the British way of life are implied here, and they can be summed up by this expostulation: who on earth, 20 years ago, would have dreamed that any of these things would come to pass? The supermarket was a newly refurbished London branch of Sainsbury's, in an area famous for its au pairs and Porsches, and so we can take it that not every branch will be tarted up to the same chic level. But, given time, who knows? Sainsbury's, I presume, needs to develop enticing new avenues to compete with Tesco and face up to the revivified Asda, but in certain instances it is doing the old things better than anyone. Two of these instances are Muscadet and Chinon. Sainsbury's Classic Selection Muscadet Sevre et Maine 1999 (16 points out of 20, \u00a34.99) rates an 'Astonishing!' wine note. It is the highest rating Muscadet I've tasted in 20 years (after more or less writing off such wines as spineless rubbish). It has wonderfully minerally, sushi-knife-sharp fruit without tartness, and I am led to believe that, unlike raw fish on lumps of rice, it is available at most branches. Sainsbury's Chinon Domaine du Colombier 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), alas, is not, but it is, I am reliably informed, well distributed nevertheless (call 0800 632262 for details). This is the best vintage of this engaging cabernet franc for some years. It parades ripe cherries, slatey tannins and a lovely, bitter cherry/cobnut finish.

      "body": "<p>When he was 12 or 13, sometime around 1972, Matthew Bourne started taking the bus two or three evenings a week from his home in workaday Walthamstow into London's theatreland. There was a hint of the magic to come as the 38 rumbled past Sadler's Wells in Islington. But not till it reached Shaftesbury Avenue where, as dusk faded into night and showbiz names blinked in yellow lights, was the spell fully cast. </p> <p>In school blazers, Bourne and his friend, Simon Carter - both obsessive autograph hunters - would arrive at the stage door of the Apollo, Lyric, Palace or Queens theatres to waylay actors on their way in.\"We were very polite to everyone,\" Bourne recalls. \"It was always sir and miss. We were never rude or familiar, so we got a lot of names.\" Gradually, the boys were accepted by the clique of adults who habitually hung round theatres and hotels in the hope of getting the signatures of the famous. \"They were all misfits, and I'd be embarrassed to say I was doing it now,\" says Bourne. </p> <p>To find out where the stars were staying, they clubbed together for a subscription to a celebrity bulletin, which was posted to the self-important doyenne of the group. \"You used to ring her up twice a week to get the names. She'd just read out the list - 'Elizabeth Taylor, Dorchester, two nights; Gloria Swanson, Connaught, three nights'. She never even said hello or goodbye; she was totally charmless.\" Even so, she was the link with the twilight world of posh hotels and first nights where stage and screen stars became real people in coats and hats. </p> <p>Fast forward almost 30 years. A few weeks ago, around six pm - the hour when he used to haunt stage doors - Bourne was sitting alone in the stalls of the Old Vic, snacking from a plastic tray; afternoon rehearsals over; evening session to come. Between its try-out in the provinces and the London opening, Bourne was fine-tuning his latest show. Devised by him and performed by the company he created, Adventures in Motion Pictures, it opened this week at the Old Vic. In 2002 the theatre will become AMP's permanent home. The fan has come in from the cold. </p> <p>The former schoolboy whose good manners charmed the big names of showbiz has shaken the canon of classic ballet and shocked some traditionalists. He's not the bad boy of British dance - that's still Michael Clark with his dildos and bare bottoms. But, given there's always an erotic charge in ballet, Bourne has stepped up the voltage, famously recasting Swan Lane as a piece mainly for blokes, and presenting a sexually dysfunctional household in Cinderella, which he set in the London Blitz. </p> <p>Now he has turned Carmen into a ballet about a male drifter, a bisexual who bowls into a small US township like a hormonal hurricane. Bourne has relocated the workplace from cigarette factory to garage, and flagrantly flagged up the liberties he's taken with a tongue-in-cheeky title:from Carmen to Car Man. No wonder some pillars of the dance world have had palpitations. But plaudits from audiences and most critics attest to Bourne's success in bringing closer the once-separate realms of classical and contemporary dance and dance theatre. In commercial terms, AMP has leapt from the fringe to the big stage. Swan Lake clocked up 120 performances after its West End transfer in 1996 - the longest run for a full-length dance classic. It has garnered international awards and played to packed houses on Broadway </p> <p>But if Swan Lake was the work which put him in the international spotlight, another fairy tale might serve as a metaphor for his early life: the Ugly Duckling. \"I had black hair when I was born and a big red spot on my nose,\" he says. \"The nurses used to make fun of me because I was ugly, which upset my mother.\" That blotch soon disappeared and Bourne grew up into a kid smiling readily enough for the family album; in some photos, though, there's a hint that he'd sooner be playing his own game than joining in anyone else's. </p> <p>At the mixed comprehensive he attended - Sir George Monoux (now a sixth-form college): the teachers offered no encouragement for the artistic projects Bourne liked. It was a rough place, with the girls tougher than the boys. \"I absolutely hated it; was terrified of it; never learned anything. I was slightly bullied, not terribly, but I certainly wasn't the 'in' person.\" His mother remembers he told her once that he'd learned not to look anybody in the eye. </p> <p>At home his hobby was putting on amateur shows, dreamed up from movies he'd seen with his parents, both big film fans. He roped in his mother to sew costumes, father to make the sets, and his brother to act and sing. Matthew had developed a passion for music and dance from his fifth birthday, when he was taken to see The Sound Of Music; he's been a fan of the show ever since. Later his mother passed on her own Cockney girlhood habit of going \"up West\" and queuing for a seat in the gods. He didn't tell anyone at school about his autograph hunting, or about the amateur shows. </p> <p>His parents, June and Jim, had lost their first baby, and doted on their two surviving sons. They always thought Matthew would end up on the stage, but they were not pushy. Jim was with Thames Water for 30 years, working his way up to be a supply controller; June was a secretary. They still live in the rented house on a small 1930s private estate where the boys grew up; it almost passes for rustic compared with its high-rise neighbours. They had the chance to buy the house years ago, but their sons' needs came first. \"We tried to give them everything they wanted,\" says Jim. \"Dan [the younger] was sporty like us, and we used to spend our money on a bit of coaching for him. Matthew had to have his theatre tickets and a bit of money so he could buy records.\" </p> <p>The Bournes' Walthamstow house is now a shrine to the boys, Matt especially: posters, photographs with celebrities like Cameron Macintosh and Shirley MacLaine. And the family still has a behind-the-scenes supporting role in Matthew's shows. June and Jim adore attending first nights in London or Los Angeles. \"My mum was always a bit stylish, but now she's more so,\" says Bourne; June says she still casts an eye on the costumes (now made professionally, where she once used to run them up) and organises the AMP fans' magazine. </p> <p>As well as their day jobs, Jim and June did evening youth work for more than 20 years. The clubs they ran became a bit rougher as the neighbourhood changed, so they sent their sons off to one run by the Methodists. It had a choir and a drama group: Matthew was in his element, and was soon staging potted versions of musicals. </p> <p>At school, though, Bourne served his time, increasingly bored until he left with two A-levels (grade Cs) and no clear idea about a career. As a sixth-former, he says his teacher pretty well put him off Shakespeare for ever. For A-level exams, he read Brodie's Notes instead of the set books. </p> <p>Frustration set in quickly when he started work, first as a clerk in the BBC contracts department. His vague idea was that it might lead to something creative. It didn't. Next, the Keith Prowse ticket agency (\"very boring, but I got to see a lot of free shows\"), then he worked in the National Theatre bookshop. He might be there still if he hadn't also been an usher, and found the others weren't just theatre devotees as he was: they were drama and dance students. </p> <p>He had been increasingly led to the world of dance since he bought a ticket out of curiosity to see Swan Lake at Covent Garden. \"I must have liked it because I saw another production two weeks later at Sadler's Wells. It wasn't like I expected. They moved a lot quicker; I thought the steps were quite interesting. But I didn't come away thinking 'It's all so beautiful'. I thought it was quite odd and unusual. But I loved the glamorous central figures.\" Soon biographies of Diaghilev and Nijinsky joined movies by Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock in the personal eclectic encyclopedia of cultural references, high and low, that was to be so useful in the future. </p> <p>He made the leap in 1983, to a degree course at the Laban Centre for Movement and Dance in south London. Finding his m\u00e9tier took so long because, he says, \"I was directionless and na\u00efve about the whole thing, and my parents were too, because it was so obvious what I was into - putting on a show.\" None of his immediate family had gone to university, and no-one had suggested dance or drama school to him. </p> <p>He set up Adventures in Motion Pictures with friends from Laban. The early days of the company comprised \"gigs at \u00a330 and long drives back to London after shows, because we couldn't afford to stay overnight,\" says founder member Emma Gladstone. There were lots of experimental contemporary dance around when AMP started up. Groups such as the Cholmondeleys and the Featherstonehaughs are still stepping out, but AMP is unusual, if not unique, in making a commercial crossover. </p> <p> There's been sniping from some in the contemporary camp that Bourne's company has sold out. Gladstone though, now assistant director of The Place theatre, believes this criticism is misplaced. \"Matt's had huge commercial potential from the beginning. He makes dance that's accessible and well-crafted\". And he has paid his dues: \"He didn't get any real recognition for 10 years.\" </p> <p>After producing a dozen or so small works, the break came when Bourne was asked to choreograph the Nutcracker for Opera North in 1992. His wit, mischief and originality were set loose on a classic. Katherine Dor\u00e9, who joined AMP as administrator in 1989 and is now its business brain, says, \"Nutcracker was a big learning curve for us. I said to Matt we either take the next step without being under the umbrella of Opera North and the Arts Council or we go back to being six dancers in a mini-van.\" </p> <p>They decided to bet on the bigtime, though they haven't made a mint - yet, though people assume they must have coined it with Swan Lake. Dor\u00e9, who also produces the company's work, has brought in more financial discipline, and says: \"In the end, the sums probably come out at zero, but the perception is that we've made an absolute fortune because of its high profile.\" </p> <p>When AMP was an infant, Bourne was happy enough to muck in, licking envelopes and writing press releases. Now that he's free of those responsibilities he's relieved. \"I don't really enjoy the business side of it. As long as I've got artistic control, I'm OK, but I wouldn't know where to begin to raise money.\" The one big profitable project he's had to date was nothing to do with AMP. Cameron Mackintosh asked him to do much of the choreography for the 1995 revival of Oliver!, and the fees for this paid for the house in Islington where he lives with his partner, Arthur Pita, a principle dancer with AMP. </p> <p>Bourne is now 40; he has the same build as Kenneth Branagh, but looks more unassuming. Watching him at a late rehearsal for Car Man, outsiders wouldn't take him for a former dancer. The waist has filled out a bit; he moves economically, almost stiffly; he's generally easy-going and affable. But as a dozen young dancers go through their sexual aerobics for a scene in act one, outside Dino's Diner, he hovers anxiously as if watching a workman fix the plumbing. He's made his mark as a choreographer, though it's a word he's still shy of using. Too pompous, he says. \"I call what I do shows; I don't call them ballets.\" Fred Astaire was as much an influence as Frederick Ashton. </p> <p>Just as well, as far as Clement Crisp, dance critic of the Financial Times, is concerned: \"I don't think of him at all seriously as a choreographer; he's an astute producer.\" Crisp, a critic for 45 years, is quite fed up with Bourne's way of \"turning some of ballet's older masterpieces upside down and shaking them to see what falls out of their pockets.\" Although he maintains that Bourne \"polishes off his scores with the sensitivity of Sweeney Todd\", and that his dance numbers are \"laboured rather than felicitous\", Crisp nonetheless allows that AMP has some virtues. It has enlarged the audience for dance, and the public loves it; however its productions are nothing to do with ballet, says Crisp wearily. </p> <p>The opposite, upbeat view comes from the New Yorker's dance writer, Joan Acocella, who mentions Bourne in the same breath as Frederick Ashton (\"England's master of classicism, of dance as dance\") and Kenneth MacMillan (\"the story man, the dance dramatist\"), who dominated the British scene for decades. Since their deaths, there had been no worthy successor to carry either strand forward, argues Acocella. Seeing Cinderella in Los Angeles, she confirmed her opinion that \"now, at last, in Bourne we have someone really interesting, large-minded - also young and wild - and he is an inheritor of MacMillan.\" </p> <p>Laurels indeed, but Bourne himself is too canny to flaunt them before the Covent Garden cognoscenti. He wooed Royal Ballet's Adam Cooper and Sarah Wildor to appear in Swan Lake and Cinderella, but he's not of the classical tribe. He accepts their tributes but can't resist cocking a camp snook. When a diva or a dowager inquires, \"When were you at the [RB] school?\" he replies with faux innocence, \"What school would that be?\" </p> <p>Bourne's reputation is for crossing more cultural boundaries than Sam Mendes. He's doing the dance numbers for a revival of the musical My Fair Lady at the National Theatre, where he hopes Trevor Nunn will let him direct Pal Joey in 2002; Disney has asked AMP to work on a version of the Little Mermaid; and he's in discussions to do a stage dance/musical version of Edward Scissorhands, a gothic story of an outsider at large in the stifling suburbs, which may have some personal resonance for an ex-Walthamstow boy.. </p> <p>For all his closeness to his family, there was one secret Bourne didn't reveal for a long time: his sexuality. He didn't hide it, but it wasn't something the family talked about. Bourne didn't admit to himself that he was gay till he was 18. It seems to have been a relatively tranquil rite of passage. Tom Robinson's single, Glad To Be Gay was a pop anthem in 1978. On the sleeve was the Gay Switchboard phone number. He rang it and was referred to an address in grimy Holloway. Expecting to see a councillor surrounded by depressed teenagers, his heart jumped when he found himself in a gay youthclub. He was flattered to be pounced on \"till I realised it happened all the time when new blood arrived\". </p> <p>His qualification reveals modesty but, even more, evidence of Bourne's self-steadying, self-preserving mechanism. He makes no bones about being gay but, says Judith Mackrell, the Guardian's dance editor, it would be anathema to him to be labelled as a gay choreographer because that would be too limiting. Dancers closest to him know that he doesn't fully open up to anyone, except his partner, Pita. </p> <p> Bourne's coming out stretched over the last carefree years in the early 80s before Aids scythed its path. He discoed to Donna Summer and the Bee Gees and came home late, remaining silent when faced with a questioning Mum. June Bourne says, \"I had a feeling he might have been gay by the time he was four, but I don't think Jim knew, because we never discussed it.\" They both seem quite tickled that Matthew publicly announced the fact in an aside on the South Bank Show. Bourne was never uneasy about his sexuality, he says. \"When I first kissed a guy, it felt the most natural thing in the world to me. But the odd thing was that, up to the point when it happened, though I was attracted by images of [male] pop stars, I'd never really imagined myself with a man - or with anyone.\" </p> <p>He has stayed in long-term relationships: with Arthur Pita for five years - they became an item some time after Pita (who been in Cinderella and Swan Lake and is in Car Man) joined AMP; and for seven years before that with David Manners, who designed for the company. \"My friend Simon [Carter] says I've always gone from one relationship to another - I've always got the next one lined up.\" Bourne jokes about his constancy, but he admits, \"I suppose I was always looking for someone to be with. I wasn't sexually led, particularly. If I was with someone, that was it.\" </p> <p>The dance world isn't synonymous with gay culture, though they overlap. The forays Bourne made to the West End as a teenager - \"it was my playground\" - had a dual purpose: social and sexual; entertainment and cultural. In dance, they overlapped. \"There's always been a sort of allure of eroticism in dance; that appealed to me. I do get infatuated with certain dancers I work with - in a way you have to, to want to make roles for them. I did with Adam Cooper [who's heterosexual]. But it's the same with a female dancer for me as well - you have to pour a lot into them to get something back.\" </p> <p>But sometimes a relationship isn't possible; and sometimes ideas have to be redrafted. There's a wonderful inventiveness which is all his own, for instance, giving Cinderella a Norma Desmond of a stepmother, adding two weirdos as stepbrothers, and making the fairy godmother a (male) guardian angel. His idea for setting it in the Blitz was partly based on his relatives' experience in the war, but his research revealed that Prokofiev composed the ballet in the 1940s, further justification for recreating the ballet as a wartime piece. </p> <p>In Swan Lake, however, his original idea for two black male dancers to take the leads didn't come off - the dancers he wanted thought it stupid. There was another disappointment with his new work. Though he wrote the Car Man with Adam Cooper in mind, Cooper declined, possibly because, having left the Royal Ballet, he wants to earn bigger fees than AMP can pay. In future, Bourne says AMP won't have guest stars; it will be an ensemble (which is how it started), presenting its repertory several months a year at the Old Vic, and touring. </p> <p>While fresh ideas are his forte, he's glad of the input of dancers when it comes to the choreography. Katharine Dor\u00e9 says, \"I see Matt as the grand editor, in as much as the dancers create movements and characters. Matt will give them the name and the essence of a character. They go away and create the role, then he brings it all together, taking the bits that work and discarding the others. That's his genius.\" Scott Ambler, an associate director who has been with the company since 1991, confirms this: \"As for coming up with the steps, I think Matt finds this the least interesting. He likes the ideas, then the dancers will shape them into dance material, then he can work with it.\" </p> <p>All choreography is a joint effort, Judith Mackrell points out, and much as she admires Bourne, she doesn't put him in the first rank. She notes, for example, that he has come up with more interesting steps for male than for female dancers. </p> <p>While the older generation of classical dancers pays Bourne rather prim and proper compliments - Dame Beryl Grey says he's a great talent who has done much to popularise ballet - younger stars are more openly enthusiastic. The Royal Ballet's Deborah Bull says, \"Matthew is a fantastic producer. He has a wonderful eye and a wonderful way of giving new life to traditional work.\" That's particularly valuable, she believes, because, unlike other art forms, ballet currently lacks great producers. </p> <p>As bigger projects came, Bourne's approach had to be modified. AMP started \"as a bunch of mates\", Ambler explains. \"Because they were all students, they all had the same dance language, so it could be much more cooperative. Matt was quite happy to go into the group and say, 'I'm choreographing this piece' because he knew what styles they knew.\" </p> <p>When Swan Lake reached the West End, there had to be eight performances a week for the production to pay its way. That meant a total of 45 dancers split into three casts. With a bigger intake of performers with different backgrounds, Bourne had to get used to working with new people instead of the core he was used to. Ambler says he soon realised that new people could offer things he didn't know - \"he's interested in ballet, jazz dance, modern - he really enjoys that kind of melting pot, and the input of different dancers.\" </p> <p>But that flexibility wasn't always there. Dor\u00e9 recalls that in 1990, after AMP had got Equity cards for dancers, some obviously moved on. But Bourne had been so attuned to working with them \"he was sitting with his head in his hands saying 'it's finished'.\" </p> <p>A small detail, says Dor\u00e9 but it reveals Bourne's needs to protect himself: \"He always looks on the pessimistic side.\" They both realise now, she says, that they won't go on for ever with AMP. There will be growth, and an expanded repertory that can be revived and toured. Eventually AMP may end, but there is optimism as other projects come along. Hollywood, among many other suitors, is beckoning. Bourne says ,\"I see myself stopping when I'm really happy with what I've done. I've no ambition to have the work carried on and on, but I do like the fact that I'm in the history books of dance.\" His Swan Lake gets a mention in the new Macmillan encyclopedia of dance. \"That pleases me more than anything,\" he says. </p> <p>It is, after all, a more permanent tribute to the work of any artist than the transient attention of fans. Bourne was reminded of that a few weeks ago when, outside a theatre, he spotted, from long ago, the queen of the autograph hunters he used to hang round with. \"She didn't recognise me.\" Of course.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When he was 12 or 13, sometime around 1972, Matthew Bourne started taking the bus two or three evenings a week from his home in workaday Walthamstow into London's theatreland. There was a hint of the magic to come as the 38 rumbled past Sadler's Wells in Islington. But not till it reached Shaftesbury Avenue where, as dusk faded into night and showbiz names blinked in yellow lights, was the spell fully cast. In school blazers, Bourne and his friend, Simon Carter - both obsessive autograph hunters - would arrive at the stage door of the Apollo, Lyric, Palace or Queens theatres to waylay actors on their way in.\"We were very polite to everyone,\" Bourne recalls. \"It was always sir and miss. We were never rude or familiar, so we got a lot of names.\" Gradually, the boys were accepted by the clique of adults who habitually hung round theatres and hotels in the hope of getting the signatures of the famous. \"They were all misfits, and I'd be embarrassed to say I was doing it now,\" says Bourne. To find out where the stars were staying, they clubbed together for a subscription to a celebrity bulletin, which was posted to the self-important doyenne of the group. \"You used to ring her up twice a week to get the names. She'd just read out the list - 'Elizabeth Taylor, Dorchester, two nights; Gloria Swanson, Connaught, three nights'. She never even said hello or goodbye; she was totally charmless.\" Even so, she was the link with the twilight world of posh hotels and first nights where stage and screen stars became real people in coats and hats. Fast forward almost 30 years. A few weeks ago, around six pm - the hour when he used to haunt stage doors - Bourne was sitting alone in the stalls of the Old Vic, snacking from a plastic tray; afternoon rehearsals over; evening session to come. Between its try-out in the provinces and the London opening, Bourne was fine-tuning his latest show. Devised by him and performed by the company he created, Adventures in Motion Pictures, it opened this week at the Old Vic. In 2002 the theatre will become AMP's permanent home. The fan has come in from the cold. The former schoolboy whose good manners charmed the big names of showbiz has shaken the canon of classic ballet and shocked some traditionalists. He's not the bad boy of British dance - that's still Michael Clark with his dildos and bare bottoms. But, given there's always an erotic charge in ballet, Bourne has stepped up the voltage, famously recasting Swan Lane as a piece mainly for blokes, and presenting a sexually dysfunctional household in Cinderella, which he set in the London Blitz. Now he has turned Carmen into a ballet about a male drifter, a bisexual who bowls into a small US township like a hormonal hurricane. Bourne has relocated the workplace from cigarette factory to garage, and flagrantly flagged up the liberties he's taken with a tongue-in-cheeky title:from Carmen to Car Man. No wonder some pillars of the dance world have had palpitations. But plaudits from audiences and most critics attest to Bourne's success in bringing closer the once-separate realms of classical and contemporary dance and dance theatre. In commercial terms, AMP has leapt from the fringe to the big stage. Swan Lake clocked up 120 performances after its West End transfer in 1996 - the longest run for a full-length dance classic. It has garnered international awards and played to packed houses on Broadway But if Swan Lake was the work which put him in the international spotlight, another fairy tale might serve as a metaphor for his early life: the Ugly Duckling. \"I had black hair when I was born and a big red spot on my nose,\" he says. \"The nurses used to make fun of me because I was ugly, which upset my mother.\" That blotch soon disappeared and Bourne grew up into a kid smiling readily enough for the family album; in some photos, though, there's a hint that he'd sooner be playing his own game than joining in anyone else's. At the mixed comprehensive he attended - Sir George Monoux (now a sixth-form college): the teachers offered no encouragement for the artistic projects Bourne liked. It was a rough place, with the girls tougher than the boys. \"I absolutely hated it; was terrified of it; never learned anything. I was slightly bullied, not terribly, but I certainly wasn't the 'in' person.\" His mother remembers he told her once that he'd learned not to look anybody in the eye. At home his hobby was putting on amateur shows, dreamed up from movies he'd seen with his parents, both big film fans. He roped in his mother to sew costumes, father to make the sets, and his brother to act and sing. Matthew had developed a passion for music and dance from his fifth birthday, when he was taken to see The Sound Of Music; he's been a fan of the show ever since. Later his mother passed on her own Cockney girlhood habit of going \"up West\" and queuing for a seat in the gods. He didn't tell anyone at school about his autograph hunting, or about the amateur shows. His parents, June and Jim, had lost their first baby, and doted on their two surviving sons. They always thought Matthew would end up on the stage, but they were not pushy. Jim was with Thames Water for 30 years, working his way up to be a supply controller; June was a secretary. They still live in the rented house on a small 1930s private estate where the boys grew up; it almost passes for rustic compared with its high-rise neighbours. They had the chance to buy the house years ago, but their sons' needs came first. \"We tried to give them everything they wanted,\" says Jim. \"Dan [the younger] was sporty like us, and we used to spend our money on a bit of coaching for him. Matthew had to have his theatre tickets and a bit of money so he could buy records.\" The Bournes' Walthamstow house is now a shrine to the boys, Matt especially: posters, photographs with celebrities like Cameron Macintosh and Shirley MacLaine. And the family still has a behind-the-scenes supporting role in Matthew's shows. June and Jim adore attending first nights in London or Los Angeles. \"My mum was always a bit stylish, but now she's more so,\" says Bourne; June says she still casts an eye on the costumes (now made professionally, where she once used to run them up) and organises the AMP fans' magazine. As well as their day jobs, Jim and June did evening youth work for more than 20 years. The clubs they ran became a bit rougher as the neighbourhood changed, so they sent their sons off to one run by the Methodists. It had a choir and a drama group: Matthew was in his element, and was soon staging potted versions of musicals.

But the odd thing was that, up to the point when it happened, though I was attracted by images of [male] pop stars, I'd never really imagined myself with a man - or with anyone.\" He has stayed in long-term relationships: with Arthur Pita for five years - they became an item some time after Pita (who been in Cinderella and Swan Lake and is in Car Man) joined AMP; and for seven years before that with David Manners, who designed for the company. \"My friend Simon [Carter] says I've always gone from one relationship to another - I've always got the next one lined up.\" Bourne jokes about his constancy, but he admits, \"I suppose I was always looking for someone to be with. I wasn't sexually led, particularly. If I was with someone, that was it.\" The dance world isn't synonymous with gay culture, though they overlap. The forays Bourne made to the West End as a teenager - \"it was my playground\" - had a dual purpose: social and sexual; entertainment and cultural. In dance, they overlapped. \"There's always been a sort of allure of eroticism in dance; that appealed to me. I do get infatuated with certain dancers I work with - in a way you have to, to want to make roles for them. I did with Adam Cooper [who's heterosexual]. But it's the same with a female dancer for me as well - you have to pour a lot into them to get something back.\" But sometimes a relationship isn't possible; and sometimes ideas have to be redrafted. There's a wonderful inventiveness which is all his own, for instance, giving Cinderella a Norma Desmond of a stepmother, adding two weirdos as stepbrothers, and making the fairy godmother a (male) guardian angel. His idea for setting it in the Blitz was partly based on his relatives' experience in the war, but his research revealed that Prokofiev composed the ballet in the 1940s, further justification for recreating the ballet as a wartime piece. In Swan Lake, however, his original idea for two black male dancers to take the leads didn't come off - the dancers he wanted thought it stupid. There was another disappointment with his new work. Though he wrote the Car Man with Adam Cooper in mind, Cooper declined, possibly because, having left the Royal Ballet, he wants to earn bigger fees than AMP can pay. In future, Bourne says AMP won't have guest stars; it will be an ensemble (which is how it started), presenting its repertory several months a year at the Old Vic, and touring. While fresh ideas are his forte, he's glad of the input of dancers when it comes to the choreography. Katharine Dor\u00e9 says, \"I see Matt as the grand editor, in as much as the dancers create movements and characters. Matt will give them the name and the essence of a character. They go away and create the role, then he brings it all together, taking the bits that work and discarding the others. That's his genius.\" Scott Ambler, an associate director who has been with the company since 1991, confirms this: \"As for coming up with the steps, I think Matt finds this the least interesting. He likes the ideas, then the dancers will shape them into dance material, then he can work with it.\" All choreography is a joint effort, Judith Mackrell points out, and much as she admires Bourne, she doesn't put him in the first rank. She notes, for example, that he has come up with more interesting steps for male than for female dancers. While the older generation of classical dancers pays Bourne rather prim and proper compliments - Dame Beryl Grey says he's a great talent who has done much to popularise ballet - younger stars are more openly enthusiastic. The Royal Ballet's Deborah Bull says, \"Matthew is a fantastic producer. He has a wonderful eye and a wonderful way of giving new life to traditional work.\" That's particularly valuable, she believes, because, unlike other art forms, ballet currently lacks great producers. As bigger projects came, Bourne's approach had to be modified. AMP started \"as a bunch of mates\", Ambler explains. \"Because they were all students, they all had the same dance language, so it could be much more cooperative. Matt was quite happy to go into the group and say, 'I'm choreographing this piece' because he knew what styles they knew.\" When Swan Lake reached the West End, there had to be eight performances a week for the production to pay its way. That meant a total of 45 dancers split into three casts. With a bigger intake of performers with different backgrounds, Bourne had to get used to working with new people instead of the core he was used to. Ambler says he soon realised that new people could offer things he didn't know - \"he's interested in ballet, jazz dance, modern - he really enjoys that kind of melting pot, and the input of different dancers.\" But that flexibility wasn't always there. Dor\u00e9 recalls that in 1990, after AMP had got Equity cards for dancers, some obviously moved on. But Bourne had been so attuned to working with them \"he was sitting with his head in his hands saying 'it's finished'.\" A small detail, says Dor\u00e9 but it reveals Bourne's needs to protect himself: \"He always looks on the pessimistic side.\" They both realise now, she says, that they won't go on for ever with AMP. There will be growth, and an expanded repertory that can be revived and toured. Eventually AMP may end, but there is optimism as other projects come along. Hollywood, among many other suitors, is beckoning. Bourne says ,\"I see myself stopping when I'm really happy with what I've done. I've no ambition to have the work carried on and on, but I do like the fact that I'm in the history books of dance.\" His Swan Lake gets a mention in the new Macmillan encyclopedia of dance. \"That pleases me more than anything,\" he says. It is, after all, a more permanent tribute to the work of any artist than the transient attention of fans. Bourne was reminded of that a few weeks ago when, outside a theatre, he spotted, from long ago, the queen of the autograph hunters he used to hang round with. \"She didn't recognise me.\" Of course.",

      "body": "<p>Once, it was imported Pyrenean and salt marsh lamb that made chefs swoon. Now, it is Scottish North Highland Fine Lamb (NHFL, 01863 766505) that gets rave reviews from the likes of Michel Roux, Rowley Leigh and our very own Jeremy Lee. </p> <p>The overheated kitchens of the capital's top eateries are a world away from the heartbreakingly beautifulheather moorland of the Strath Of Kildonan, a remote corner of remote Sutherland. There, you have to scan the landscape for the white dots that are these celebrated sheep. Blink, and you'll miss them. The term \"free-range\" just cannot do justice to these creatures - they have the outdoor lifestyle of wild animals and, to all intents and purposes, would qualify as game were it not for the fact that they can be herded by dogs. They walk dozens of miles each day, drinking spring water and seeking out their favourite feed, ling, bell heather, lungwort and cottongrass being just a handful of species in the rich plant mix that is their birthright. </p> <p>Birthright? Yes, these sheep have an impeccable pedigree. They are traditional breeds: the positively Alpine neat little Blackface or the short North Country Cheviot. They come from closed flocks that have been registered on the same estates for more than 100 years, with no cross-breeding for bigger, faster-growing animals. In shepherding terms, they are \"hefted\", or acclimatised, to their location and won't stray. That means that even if you herded them into a van and dumped them in Inverness, they'd more than likely find their way back home. </p> <p>That home is majestically scenic, but also tough and inhospitable, and only these breeds have the survival skills to hack it up here. With its short summer and harsh winter, the environment makes for slow growth, which is why the first \"new season\" NHFL is six months old when killed, while the bulk of the output is in much older lamb, known as hogget, or even mutton, at 18 months or so. </p> <p>It is how you would hope all lamb is reared. Dream on: most of it is from sheep cross-bred for quick growth, reared mainly indoors, fed concentrated animal feed, fattened in muddy fields and despatched to our plates in a rapid three months. That, unfortunately, is the way the lamb market is going. By 1999, the market price of sheep was at an all-time low, putting farmers under pressure to cut costs and get their lamb to table as quickly as possible - or give up entirely. These days, farmers increasingly view sheep as little more than expensive lawnmowers. </p> <p>All of which leaves consumers with no way of knowing whether their lamb is from a do-it-right farmer or a do-it-fast farmer, since it is generally sold as one undifferentiated category, country of origin being the only distinguishing feature - a ridiculously rudimentary state of affairs, since traditionally reared, mature lamb tastes as different from most fast-growth stuff as wild salmon does from farmed. Or is that just whimsy? </p> <p>Out in the glens, it was easy to be persuaded of the notional advantages of this Sutherland lamb. Back in my kitchen, a tasting confirmed the romantic prejudice. I pitted some NHFL cutlets (out of the farmer's freezer and defrosted negligently in the car boot) against some freshly-bought cutlets from an upmarket multiple. Tasted blind, the unanimous preference was for the Sutherland lamb. The multiple's lamb was tougher, watery and comparatively devoid of flavour, while the NHFL cutlets were exceptionally tender, with a deeper, sweeter more aromatic character. No contest. </p> <p>The impetus behind NHFL, a venture launched by farmers Michael Wigan and Charlie Brooke, is to introduce a location-based brand into the market that consumers can latch on to, and so create sales for sheep reared in a traditional manner but to strict production standards. \"The quality and taste of our meat is the only thing we've got going for us,\" says Wigan. \"We want to get recognition for the quality of meat, not just see it disappearing in a supply of mass-produced 'Scotch' lamb.\" </p> <p>Working so closely with chefs for whom the quality of raw materials is almost a religion, Wigan and Brooke have also had to ensure that there is no weak link in the production chain. In winter, when natural feed has to be supplemented, the sheep are given home-grown hay and silage, never bought-in concentrates. When they are ready for fattening, they are moved on to coastal farms and fed turnips until they have just enough, but not too much, fat. A short journey takes them to the slaughterhouse in Inverness, without being traumatised. Hanging for at least seven days or more ensures that the meat stays tender. So, what princely sum does this formidable lamb attract? A very reasonable average \u00a34 a pound - and it's delivered to your door, to boot. Here's hoping that more beleaguered sheep farmers follow this precedent - in droves. </p> <p> All recipes serve six. </p> <p><strong> Lamb sweetbreads with peas, almonds and mint</strong></p> <p> <strong> 280g lamb sweetbreads </strong></p> <p><strong>Vegetable oil, for frying </strong></p> <p><strong>1 clove garlic </strong></p> <p><strong>20g whole blanched almonds </strong></p> <p><strong>40g shelled peas </strong></p> <p><strong>30g unsalted butter </strong></p> <p><strong>8 fresh mint leaves, chopped</strong> </p> <p>Put the sweetbreads in a colander and place under running cold water for an hour, to rinse off all impurities. Place a pan of water on a high heat and, when boiling, drain the sweetbreads and drop them in the pot. Stir and cook for a minute only. Drain in a colander, lay the sweetbreads on a tray and cover with another that is weighted down. Leave for half an hour, until they have cooled. Peel the sweetbreads, removing only the little pieces of fat and membrane adhering to the outside. Cook the peas in boiling water seasoned with salt and a little sugar. Finely chop the garlic and chop the almonds very small. </p> <p>Heat a heavy-based frying pan. Put a spoonful of flour on a plate, add salt and milled pepper, toss the sweetbreads in the flour and shake off any excess. Pour in enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and lay in the breads in one layer. Once they have turned a pleasing gold, turn and add the garlic/almond mix. Cook for a three to three to four minutes, until golden brown. Add the butter and peas, raise the heat, add the mint and adjust the seasoning. Serve at once. </p> <p><strong> Roast leg of lamb in the abruzzi manner</strong></p> <p> The milk of the sheep of Abruzzi region is used to make Pecorino. It is unlikely that you'll get authentic Italian lamb in the UK, but this manner of cooking can be emulated with our own produce, as long as it's top quality.</p> <p><strong> 1 2-2.3kg, leg of lamb, boned and butterflied </strong></p> <p><strong>5-6 cloves garlic </strong></p> <p><strong>Sea salt </strong></p> <p><strong>A fully-charged pepper mill </strong></p> <p><strong>3 tbsp good olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong>900g good waxy potatoes </strong></p> <p><strong>2 small sprigs rosemary</strong> </p> <p>Ask your butcher to prepare the meat for you. Preheat the oven to 225C/ 425F/gas mark 7. Peel the garlic, cut it into thick slivers and insert into the flesh of the lamb. Liberally season the meat with salt and pepper. Peel the potatoes, cut them into 2.5cm dice and rinse under cold water. </p> <p>Heat a big roasting tray in the oven. Remove the tray from the oven, pour in the oil, lay the lamb in the bottom and surround it with the potatoes. Put the tray back in the oven and, after five minutes, reduce the heat to 160C/325F/gas mark 3, and scatter salt and pepper over the potatoes. Push the rosemary into the meat, and scatter a few leaves among the spuds, then turn the meat and potatoes over. Cook for another 20 minutes, then transfer the lamb to a serving dish. Return the potatoes to the oven until crisp, then tip them and all the cooking juices into the serving dish and take the lot to the table. (In Italy, they sprinkle grated Pecorino over the spuds - by all means do the same, as long as you can get hold of the good stuff.) </p> <p><strong> Rack of lamb with mustard and parsley crust</strong></p> <p> Old-fashioned and brilliant.</p> <p><strong> 3 racks lamb, with 18 chops in total </strong></p> <p><strong>1 big handful flat-leaf parsley </strong></p> <p><strong>2 big handfuls white breadcrumbs </strong></p> <p><strong>Sea salt and fresh black pepper </strong></p> <p><strong>2-3 large tbsp Dijon mustard </strong></p> <p> Ask your butcher to chine and trim the racks. Heat the oven to 225C/425F/gas mark 7. Finely chop the parsley and mix with the breadcrumbs and seasonings. Spread the mustard over the fat on the lamb, then dip the racks into the crumb/ parsley mix - the crust should be evenly distributed. </p> <p>Heat a roasting tray and pour in a little oil. Entwine the bones of two racks, like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and lay them, crust-side down, in the oil. Lay the other rack beside them. (Alternatively, lay the three racks, bones upwards, side by side.) Cook for 10-12 minutes for medium rare. Leave to sit for 10 minutes before carving. </p> <p><strong> Lamb korma</strong></p> <p> Come summertime, I get cravings for Indian food and start leafing through An Invitation To Indian Cooking, by Madhur Jaffrey, an all-time favourite.</p> <p><strong> 3 tbsp ground coriander </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp ground cumin </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp desiccated unsweetened coconut </strong></p> <p><strong>4 medium onions, peeled and chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>5 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>1 large tomato </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp ground turmeric </strong></p> <p><strong>6 tbsp vegetable oil </strong></p> <p><strong>5 whole cardamom pods </strong></p> <p><strong>6 whole cloves </strong></p> <p><strong>7 whole black peppercorns </strong></p> <p><strong>2 bayleaves </strong></p> <p><strong>1 cinnamon stick, 5cm long </strong></p> <p><strong>2 small hot red peppers (optional) </strong></p> <p><strong>1.6kg cubed lamb - shoulder, leg or, best of all, neck </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp plain yoghurt </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tsp salt </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp garam masala</strong> </p> <p>Roast the coriander, cumin and coconut in a pan for a few minutes, until just darkened, then put to one side. Put the onions, garlic and ginger in a liquidiser, along with the tomato and turmeric, and blend to a paste. </p> <p>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat four tablespoons of oil over medium flame. When it is hot, add the cardamom, cloves, peppercorns, bayleaves, cinnamon and red peppers, and stir. Add just enough meat to sit in one layer without crowding, and cook, turning, until it is a rich brown all over. Repeat with the rest of the meat. </p> <p>Tip the browned lamb and cooked spices into another pot. Return the cooking pan to the hob, add the rest of the oil and add the paste. Stir as the liquid evaporates and the paste starts to stick to the bottom. Lower the heat and stir for five minutes longer, adding a little water as necessary. </p> <p>Now add the roasted spices, and cook, stirring, for another five minutes, then stir in the yoghurt, taking care that it does not scorch. Return the meat to the pan, add salt and enough water to cover the lamb, and stir to scrape up any spice mix adhering to the bottom of the pot. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to a quiet simmer. Cover, and leave to cook for an hour or so. Stir in the garam masala and cook for a further five minutes. </p> <p>A few sliced green chillies, some chopped fresh coriander leaves, fried onion rings and a little ground cardamom seed are a traditional finish to the korma.

      "body": "<b> The winners</b> <p><b>Road hauliers </b> They have put the case that their business is under threat from higher taxes -and they are fighting to cut pump prices for the ordinary motorist as well as themselves. They responded far more quickly to the developing situation than ministers. By giving the government 60 days to cut the price of petrol they have focused ministers' attention on the issue. </p> <p><b> Farmers </b> Their tractors regularly take part in the protests and lead the rural opposition. But few people have had the guts to take them on - where is Nick Brown, the agriculture minister? - to point out that they pay only 3.13p a litre on red diesel, compared with 48.82p for the rest of us. </p> <p><b> Public transport </b> The national railway inquiry line has a special message pleading for patience because it has been inundated by people asking for train times, suggesting a big rise in rail travel. Buses, except where hit by fuel shortages, have benefited from more passengers and clearer roads. Taxi journeys have been quicker and therefore cheaper. </p> <p><b> Conservatives </b> Their success will have to be confirmed by the next opinion poll. William Hague has been able to press his case for cutting taxes by having a concrete example to grip the voters. He has largely escaped criticism that the big tax rises were implemented by former Tory chancellor, Kenneth Clarke. </p> <p><b> Opec </b> The countries of Opec now know their true power - if they put up the price of oil it will lead to protests across the whole of Europe. </p> <p><b> The losers</b></p> <p><b>Tony Blair</b> Caught on the hop by the pickets, Tony Blair had no strategy. He appeared out of touch with the groundswell of public opinion and promised too much by saying it would all be over within 24 hours.

      "bodyText": "The winners Road hauliers They have put the case that their business is under threat from higher taxes -and they are fighting to cut pump prices for the ordinary motorist as well as themselves. They responded far more quickly to the developing situation than ministers. By giving the government 60 days to cut the price of petrol they have focused ministers' attention on the issue. Farmers Their tractors regularly take part in the protests and lead the rural opposition. But few people have had the guts to take them on - where is Nick Brown, the agriculture minister? - to point out that they pay only 3.13p a litre on red diesel, compared with 48.82p for the rest of us. Public transport The national railway inquiry line has a special message pleading for patience because it has been inundated by people asking for train times, suggesting a big rise in rail travel. Buses, except where hit by fuel shortages, have benefited from more passengers and clearer roads. Taxi journeys have been quicker and therefore cheaper. Conservatives Their success will have to be confirmed by the next opinion poll. William Hague has been able to press his case for cutting taxes by having a concrete example to grip the voters. He has largely escaped criticism that the big tax rises were implemented by former Tory chancellor, Kenneth Clarke. Opec The countries of Opec now know their true power - if they put up the price of oil it will lead to protests across the whole of Europe. The losers Tony Blair Caught on the hop by the pickets, Tony Blair had no strategy. He appeared out of touch with the groundswell of public opinion and promised too much by saying it would all be over within 24 hours. Salvaged some respect by getting Esso to drop its misconceived 2p petrol rise at the 11th hour The cabinet Despite garrulous interviews by John Prescott pointing out all the concessions already given to Mondeo man, the government case was not convincing.

Digby Jones, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: \"Companies are still concerned about the time it will take to get operations back up to speed. They are also worried about the bottom-line impact which is certain to run into hundreds of millions of pounds.\" Last night it was revealed that emergency meetings had been called at firms around the country, which had expected to close down and make staff temporarily redundant until fuel supplies came back online. The Midlands-based TRW Aerospace Systems said only the fact that fuel tankers were starting to get through had saved them from laying off employees. \"It was getting very close to that at one stage and we were very concerned as a company,\" said a spokesman. The Post Office said it was too early to assess the impact, while banks said they had suffered no financial damage. Retail Out-of-town outlets and many high street stores were badly affected by the shortages, with people reluctant to go out in cars. Sales in John Lewis stores were down \u00a32m over the past four days, but food retailers have been reporting a 50%-60% increase in sales due to panic buying.

But a spokeswoman said it was anticipating it would be similar to or worse than the week following the death of Princess Diana - the last time the British public deserted the nations shops en-masse - when sales were \u00a3230m down. Manufacturing The sector was badly hit as it runs on a \"just in time\" policy with products being made to order rather than stockpiled. Companies have been starved of raw materials and, in many cases, have ceased production as deliveries are not going out and there is no storage room. Mark Swift, national spokesman for the Engineering Employers' Federation, said: \"The end really has come in the nick of time as far as we can tell.

It would have hurt if it had carried on.\" Health According to the Department of Health the cost of the fuel crisis is impossible to quantify at the moment, but experts estimated it would run into millions of pounds. At Addenbrookes in Cambridge, the largest hospital in East Anglia, which treats almost 400,000 patients a year, all elective non-emergency surgery has been cancelled amid concerns that supplies of crucial drugs, surgical equipment and food could not be guaranteed beyond the weekend. According to Keith Day, hospital administrator, Addenbrookes will effectively pick up the tab for the same operations twice, paying the staff both for the cancelled and retimed procedure. Other costs the hospital faces include overtime pay for staff who have been able to get to work, accommodation near the hospital for key personnel who otherwise would not have been able to get in, reallocating staff away from other duties to make fuel contingency plans, and using outside suppliers for essential supplies. Tourism Tourism has been one of the biggest losers in the crisis. In Cumbria, where blockades meant it was one of the first counties to run almost completely dry, the tourist board was yesterday estimating the cost would run into hundreds of thousands of pounds. Geoff Mawdsley, whose family owns two hotels in the Lake District, said the fuel crisis had cost them more than \u00a36,000 in cancelled bookings and lost revenue. \"That may not sound much to some people but to us it is a lot,\" he said. \"Usually we would be catering for about 70 people every night, but at the moment it is less than 30.\" The Scottish tourism industry is worth \u00a37m a day to the Scottish economy, and yesterday tourism chiefs were speculating that at least one day of business has been lost during the fuel crisis. Education At least 77 schools across England and Wales have been shut since Wednesday, most of them in rural areas as transport was not available for children and teachers. Based on figures from the local government agency and the Department of Education, the cost to the taxpayer works out at roughly \u00a33,000 a school for each day it is closed. The cost of school closures yesterday alone is nearly \u00a3250,000.",

      "body": "<p>As Tony Blair returned nine days ago from the UN special assembly in New York, he confided that the French president, Jacques Chirac, had assured him his government would not crumble in the face of protests by its lorry drivers. The revolt against petrol duty would not spread across Europe.</p> <p>As Blair was speaking, a small group of self-described nobodies were driving slowly through the darkness towards the Shell Stanlow refinery at Ellesmere Port and a date with a history. The convoy had been born out of a meeting convened by Brynle Williams, a loquacious sheep and beef farmer from Cilcain, north Wales.</p> <p>The meeting, at Ruthin cattle market the previous Monday, had been addressed by politicians including Peter Rogers, a Conservative member of the Welsh assembly. Mr Rogers became a farming hero after he addressed farmers picketing Irish lorries at Holyhead in November 1997 in a protest that spawned the militant farmers' movement.</p> <p>The meeting was chaotic, Mr Rogers recalls, but at the end Mr Williams went into a huddle with a group of hauliers. They came up with a plot to blockade fuel supplies at depots starting at the weekend.</p> <p>The next day BP and Texaco raised the price of petrol in response to the rise in crude oil. By Wednesday the mood had turned so angry that Mr Williams called another meeting at the St Asaph livestock auction market for the following night.</p> <p>More than 150 farmers and hauliers met in the sales ring to toss ideas around. The French protesters had inspired them with their direct action. One of those at the meeting, Clive Swan, urged that they strike that night. He recalls saying: \"If we don't go now when we are motivated we'll will wake up tomorrow morning, saying, 'It's Aunt Betty's wedding on Sunday and I cannot go.' There were some people who were nervous. They thought they might get hoovered up by the police.\"</p> <p>Mr Williams took a vote and the majority was for a blockade of the refinery. Everyone piled into their cars and borrowed tractors and headed straight for the Stanlow refinery. It was an inspired target. The plant has a fleet of 60 tankers owned by P&amp;O Shipping and private hauliers. It distributes 1.8m tons of fuel a day to keep the north-west on the move.</p> <p>\"We thought we would stay the night, make our point, go on the morning news and go home,\" Mr Swan recalls.</p> <p>For six hours the men kept up a real blockade of tractors and lorries across the entrance. Management, desperate that their inflammable plant might become a safety risk if the mood turned ugly, called in the local Labour MP, Andrew Miller, who tried to persuade the group to move, but they refused to budge until the police marched on them. Once that happened at 4.30am, the exit routes were cleared.</p> <p>But by then, the great leaderless revolt had been sparked. The coalition of Farmers for Action and militant lorry owners had been spawned. Farmers and hauliers the next day moved on the Texaco and Elf sites in Pembrokeshire. Motorway go-slows spread.</p> <p><b> Vulnerable</b><br></p> <p>No one in Whitehall had foreseen the scale of the protest, nor the speed with which the fourth largest economy in the world could be laid low by no more than 2,000 pickets. Ministers knew they were vulnerable on petrol and diesel prices due to the fuel duty escalator.</p> <p>The escalator may have been introduced by the Tories in 1993 to ensure motorists bore the full cost of driving, including the environmental cost, but the chancellor, Gordon Brown, increased its rate from 5% to 6% in 1997, a rate continued in the budgets of 1998 and 1999.</p> <p>Between 1993 and 1998 the escalator's impact on the fuel prices was mitigated by the 40% real terms fall in the price of crude oil. Last year the price rose as Opec and continued world growth ensured undersupply. The sharp rise last spring led to the average price of diesel rising by 14% between 1999 and 2000.</p> <p>The government was slow to see that it could not go on milking the motorist for \u00a322bn in taxes a year. Antipathy to the Sun-reading, self-employed lorrymen runs deep in the Labour party. Labour conspiracy theorists, for instance, point to the Conservative domination of the Road Haulage Association.</p> <p>Martin O'Neill, the chairman of the industry select committee, said not long ago: \"Everyone knows truck drivers are some of the biggest whingers in the world.\"</p> <p><b> Antipathy</b><br></p> <p>In April last year an attempt by the then transport minister, John Reid, to placate the industry by setting up a road haulage forum was only partly successful. The forum, from which ordinary hauliers were excluded, tended to be convened by ministers in the wake of direct action.</p> <p>Even the hauliers' breakthrough in March 2000 - when Mr Brown scrapped the escalator and cut vehicle excise duty - was not enough. The price of oil was still rising and the RHA threatened a day of disruption in London on July. The Treasury grudgingly agreed to a meeting to discuss the RHA's pet idea for an essential users' rebate and in return the RHA shelved the protest. But these leisurely negotiations were rudely interrupted by the men at Stanlow and their protest.</p> <p>On Friday, as pickets spread, the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, was in Hanover, but he asked energy department officials to meet oil companies that day. By the afternoon it was agreed that two privy councillors in the department should fly to Balmoral on Monday to seek emergency powers from the Queen. It was agreed to keep the plan secret to avoid panic.</p> <p>Officials worked around the clock at the weekend preparing a list of designated petrol stations to be used for emergency supplies. Downing Street prepared a full propaganda offensive. But as the French government capitulated it started to dawn on ministers that they had a full-scale taxpayers' revolt on their hands. Petrol stations in the north-west were running dry.</p> <p>Still not aware of the impact of the protests on petrol supplies in the north, Mr Blair decided to go ahead with a two-day tour of the Midlands and Yorkshire designed to promote the e-economy. His staff had spent days preparing the trip and a sudden cancellation might trigger an atmosphere of panic. He did not want to stimulate panic buying.</p> <p>Nevertheless he inserted a no-surrender passage in his speech in Loughborough on Monday: \"We cannot and we will not alter government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets. That's not the way to make policy in Britain and as far as I'm concerned it never will be.\" He told journalists the police had assured him the exits from the refineries were clear and there was no reason for the tanker drivers not to go out. He was adamant he would not allow what had happened in France to happen in Britain, and said oil prices would fall, but could not give a date. He tried to keep calm.</p> <p>But the energy minister, Helen Liddell, admitted yesterday that Monday was the day the crisis spiralled out of control. She said: \"The fact that a week's supply of petrol sold out in a few hours last Monday is something we had not factored into our consideration.\" Ministers also began to realise that Britain has one of the most efficient national logistics supply chain managements in the world.

      "bodyText": "As Tony Blair returned nine days ago from the UN special assembly in New York, he confided that the French president, Jacques Chirac, had assured him his government would not crumble in the face of protests by its lorry drivers. The revolt against petrol duty would not spread across Europe. As Blair was speaking, a small group of self-described nobodies were driving slowly through the darkness towards the Shell Stanlow refinery at Ellesmere Port and a date with a history. The convoy had been born out of a meeting convened by Brynle Williams, a loquacious sheep and beef farmer from Cilcain, north Wales. The meeting, at Ruthin cattle market the previous Monday, had been addressed by politicians including Peter Rogers, a Conservative member of the Welsh assembly. Mr Rogers became a farming hero after he addressed farmers picketing Irish lorries at Holyhead in November 1997 in a protest that spawned the militant farmers' movement. The meeting was chaotic, Mr Rogers recalls, but at the end Mr Williams went into a huddle with a group of hauliers. They came up with a plot to blockade fuel supplies at depots starting at the weekend. The next day BP and Texaco raised the price of petrol in response to the rise in crude oil. By Wednesday the mood had turned so angry that Mr Williams called another meeting at the St Asaph livestock auction market for the following night. More than 150 farmers and hauliers met in the sales ring to toss ideas around. The French protesters had inspired them with their direct action. One of those at the meeting, Clive Swan, urged that they strike that night. He recalls saying: \"If we don't go now when we are motivated we'll will wake up tomorrow morning, saying, 'It's Aunt Betty's wedding on Sunday and I cannot go.' There were some people who were nervous. They thought they might get hoovered up by the police.\" Mr Williams took a vote and the majority was for a blockade of the refinery. Everyone piled into their cars and borrowed tractors and headed straight for the Stanlow refinery. It was an inspired target. The plant has a fleet of 60 tankers owned by P&amp;O Shipping and private hauliers. It distributes 1.8m tons of fuel a day to keep the north-west on the move. \"We thought we would stay the night, make our point, go on the morning news and go home,\" Mr Swan recalls. For six hours the men kept up a real blockade of tractors and lorries across the entrance. Management, desperate that their inflammable plant might become a safety risk if the mood turned ugly, called in the local Labour MP, Andrew Miller, who tried to persuade the group to move, but they refused to budge until the police marched on them. Once that happened at 4.30am, the exit routes were cleared. But by then, the great leaderless revolt had been sparked. The coalition of Farmers for Action and militant lorry owners had been spawned. Farmers and hauliers the next day moved on the Texaco and Elf sites in Pembrokeshire. Motorway go-slows spread. Vulnerable No one in Whitehall had foreseen the scale of the protest, nor the speed with which the fourth largest economy in the world could be laid low by no more than 2,000 pickets. Ministers knew they were vulnerable on petrol and diesel prices due to the fuel duty escalator. The escalator may have been introduced by the Tories in 1993 to ensure motorists bore the full cost of driving, including the environmental cost, but the chancellor, Gordon Brown, increased its rate from 5% to 6% in 1997, a rate continued in the budgets of 1998 and 1999. Between 1993 and 1998 the escalator's impact on the fuel prices was mitigated by the 40% real terms fall in the price of crude oil. Last year the price rose as Opec and continued world growth ensured undersupply. The sharp rise last spring led to the average price of diesel rising by 14% between 1999 and 2000. The government was slow to see that it could not go on milking the motorist for \u00a322bn in taxes a year. Antipathy to the Sun-reading, self-employed lorrymen runs deep in the Labour party. Labour conspiracy theorists, for instance, point to the Conservative domination of the Road Haulage Association. Martin O'Neill, the chairman of the industry select committee, said not long ago: \"Everyone knows truck drivers are some of the biggest whingers in the world.\" Antipathy In April last year an attempt by the then transport minister, John Reid, to placate the industry by setting up a road haulage forum was only partly successful. The forum, from which ordinary hauliers were excluded, tended to be convened by ministers in the wake of direct action. Even the hauliers' breakthrough in March 2000 - when Mr Brown scrapped the escalator and cut vehicle excise duty - was not enough. The price of oil was still rising and the RHA threatened a day of disruption in London on July. The Treasury grudgingly agreed to a meeting to discuss the RHA's pet idea for an essential users' rebate and in return the RHA shelved the protest. But these leisurely negotiations were rudely interrupted by the men at Stanlow and their protest. On Friday, as pickets spread, the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, was in Hanover, but he asked energy department officials to meet oil companies that day. By the afternoon it was agreed that two privy councillors in the department should fly to Balmoral on Monday to seek emergency powers from the Queen. It was agreed to keep the plan secret to avoid panic. Officials worked around the clock at the weekend preparing a list of designated petrol stations to be used for emergency supplies. Downing Street prepared a full propaganda offensive. But as the French government capitulated it started to dawn on ministers that they had a full-scale taxpayers' revolt on their hands. Petrol stations in the north-west were running dry. Still not aware of the impact of the protests on petrol supplies in the north, Mr Blair decided to go ahead with a two-day tour of the Midlands and Yorkshire designed to promote the e-economy. His staff had spent days preparing the trip and a sudden cancellation might trigger an atmosphere of panic. He did not want to stimulate panic buying. Nevertheless he inserted a no-surrender passage in his speech in Loughborough on Monday: \"We cannot and we will not alter government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets. That's not the way to make policy in Britain and as far as I'm concerned it never will be.\" He told journalists the police had assured him the exits from the refineries were clear and there was no reason for the tanker drivers not to go out. He was adamant he would not allow what had happened in France to happen in Britain, and said oil prices would fall, but could not give a date. He tried to keep calm. But the energy minister, Helen Liddell, admitted yesterday that Monday was the day the crisis spiralled out of control. She said: \"The fact that a week's supply of petrol sold out in a few hours last Monday is something we had not factored into our consideration.\" Ministers also began to realise that Britain has one of the most efficient national logistics supply chain managements in the world. It means companies do not keep large stocks, but are extremely vulnerable to blockages in the flow of goods. The knock-on effect to the mail, food stores and hospitals was rapid. The government's attempts to exude an air of calm collapsed on Monday night when the decision to take emergency powers appeared in the court circular of the Times. Journalists on Mr Blair's media bus were read a statement from Downing Street urging the public not to panic. By Tuesday morning it was clear Mr Blair would have to race to London to take personal charge.

Very few people want the car banned, and none of them can drive. That's merely an observation; I'm not saying you have to be guilty of something before you say it should be illegal. That would mean that you believe in one law for yourself and another for everyone else.

      "bodyText": "We are individuals as well as social beings, and open to accusations of selfishness and hypocrisy. In principle, I am opposed to capital punishment. But then I think of the people I would like to kill, and I wonder what I would do if I were minister for executions. And I realise quite what a bad idea capital punishment is. Or let us take the hot issue of transport. Clearly, we need more people to use public transport. But, if I'm selfish, I can't say I'd look forward to that, because I already use it and am frequently stuck behind people who seem to be using it for the first time. Railway ticket staff operate as a counselling service, dealing with endless inquiries from inexperienced passengers: \"So the train will just stop, and I don't have to hold my hand out or wave or anything. Right. And which platform is it?... Oh, I see, it depends where I'm going. Well where are some good places to go?\" Then of course, there is the whole issue of road usage. Very few people want the car banned, and none of them can drive. That's merely an observation; I'm not saying you have to be guilty of something before you say it should be illegal. That would mean that you believe in one law for yourself and another for everyone else. I don't know what's worse, denunciations of dope-smoking from people who don't happen to like it, or people who secretly smoke it? And is it hypocritical or selfless for a politician to promote heterosexual marriage when his own interests clearly lie elsewhere? When it comes to motoring and tax, accusations of hypocrisy fly like the pickets we used to see in the happier days when the law allowed protests by people other than the self-employed. Union leaders who denounced this week's protests were, quite unjustifiably, accused of using militant tactics themselves. In fact, they sold their members out years ago. The Liverpool dockers got no more support from the T and G than they did from the hauliers. The TUC should not be denouncing others for bringing the country to a standstill, but remembering that it can be done.

But modernity, for most of the 20th century, has meant being difficult, challenging, striking.

Even Virginia Woolf, whom many would call a modernist author, hated Ulysses, saying it made her think of a student squeezing his spots (unwittingly calling up \"the young man carbuncular\" in TS Eliot's The Waste Land, published the same year), which didn't stop her from ripping off its whole concept for her Mrs Dalloway some years later. </p> <p>Even in 1970, some people seethed about this modern stuff.

For Connolly's book concerned itself chiefly with how one could write a book that would last 50 years. The figure is arbitrary, as Connolly conceded; what he meant to ask was how one could produce something that would last. Fifty years would do, but I have a feeling he meant eternity. </p> <p>I know I have a copy of the book, somewhere, but a few days of unenthusiastic searching have failed to turn it up. I could go to the British Library, but I might as well stick with what remains in my head of the book; and, insofar as my book collection is so impractically large that as far as my wife is concerned, it is the British Library, and so in itself a symbol of literary survival in the early 21st century, I might as well pretend that, for all my practical purposes, it has become a lost book, a folk memory, like Aristotle's treatise on comedy, or Byron's autobiography. </p> <p>Connolly's book consisted, as I recall, mainly of advice to the would-be writer, and the two pieces of advice I remember are: don't be seduced by journalism, and don't have children. Only then will your mind be uncluttered enough to produce the lasting work of art that will be reprinted in Penguin Modern Classics, and, eventually, Penguin Classics. These, and the other pieces of advice which Connolly himself failed to carry out to the letter, are actually no more than apologies to himself as to why he had failed to write an enduring work.</p> <p>The point is that the pram in the hall and the Blue Bugloss (as he called children and journalism) didn't stop Thackeray, Dickens, and God knows who else from producing brilliant and eternal works. Enemies of Promise survives - in better-organised libraries than mine - but only because it cheats by addressing the very issue of survival itself.</p> <p>It's a question that is implicitly asked by the very fact of publication: how long will this work endure? It's not an easy question to answer, although you feel that it should be. After all, rubbish is rubbish, the good stuff is good, and that's that. But as soon as you say that you know that that's not right, either. Somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 books are published every week in this country alone. If those were people being born rather than books we'd be talking about a decent-sized county. Trying to finger any one of those out for any qualities whatsoever, never mind longevity, is daunting in the extreme; and as tempting of fate as wondering which baby in a maternity ward is going to grow up to be famous.</p> <p>You can't use sales as a test. Ouida, Bulwer-Lytton, and plenty of other names at the fringes of our literary consciousness sold massively in their time; bewilderingly massively, when you consider the oblivion to which their works have now been consigned. They remain, if they remain at all, as examples of rotten, melodramatic prose. (The Bulwer-Lytton Prize is awarded to the novel with the worst opening line published that year; it is based on his own opening line - not his worst, apparently, by far: \"It was a dark and stormy night,\" the line with which Schultz's Snoopy would always begin his unfinished meisterwerk.) </p> <p>You can't, conversely, use poor sales as a guide either. Kafka may have sold zero copies of his work in his lifetime - mainly because his work was published posthumously (and against his wishes); Beckett's fiction, up until the astonishing success of Waiting for Godot, may have been regarded by the very few who saw it as one of the Mysteries of Modern Publishing, but there are plenty of novels out there which sold very few copies not because their time was yet to come but because they were, and always will be, crap. And Tennyson and Dickens sold as much as Bulwer-Lytton etc. </p> <p>But I can't faff about indefinitely and say that literary longevity is unknowable. I am, after all, a critic, and this is the kind of thing I should be doing. So, assuming that publishing is holding its own against the internet (indeed, it would appear that each is doing the other a continuous series of favours), here are my rough guidelines as to what makes a classic, and which writers are our best bets for producing them. There is also the strict caveat that far too many books and writers which deserve to survive don't, simply as a matter of pressure of space and time. And that survival is itself mutable and varied: Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy survives among the cognoscenti, but there's no Penguin Classic of the book, and it would be difficult to see how there could be.</p> <p>First, the book has to be not only the product of a good literary intelligence but also sincere in its forms and aims. This is why I would rule out all examples of clever historical fiction - Orlando and Scott's historical novels survive, but only because there is a Scott industry and a Woolf industry to keep them going. Clever pastiches like The Name of the Rose and its numerous epigones will not, outside of academe. The works have to be contemporary; and it helps if they are fired by satiric grievance. So much of Martin Amis's work will survive (his father, a less competent writer, I will not lay money on), as will Evelyn Waugh's. But there mainly has to be a reason for people to want, and want badly, a certain work or writer to endure; for this reason I would put a fiver on Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, to be collected by my descendants.</p> <p>But in the end it isn't the critics who decide this matter. The best of them all, Doctor Johnson, said scornfully of Tristram Shandy, as it enjoyed a freak success in the mid 1760s, \"Nothing odd will do long; Tristram Shandy did not last\", little knowing that history was slowly pulling the rug from him as he spoke. Critics have been wary of making pronouncements about longevity ever since. That's why we leave it up to the publishers - and the people who buy their books - to sort that one out for us.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Forty years ago Jack Kerouac wrote a heartsick, but deeply premature, epitaph for what he called the \"special idea of footwalking freedom\" in America. This was the freedom of the wanderer, the hobo, the bum, the beatnik, the hitchhiker, the world of those who in his time went on the road.</p> <p>Kerouac himself had been every kind of wanderer since his youth began in the second world war. His books spring from the wonder and solitude of that experience. He and a friend, poet Alan Snyder, once saw \"a vision of a great rucksack revolution by millions of young Americans\", bursting from their prison of consumer materialism. But that hope had gone when he wrote his book of essays and sketches, Lonesome Traveller, in 1960. \"I myself was a hobo,\" he said, \"but I had to give it up because of the increasing television stories about the abominableness of strangers with packs.</p> <p>\"You can't be alone even in the primitive wilderness any more. There's always a helicopter As far as I am concerned, the only thing to do is to sit in a room and get drunk.\"</p> <p>Which is more or less what he did. He died of drink, still writing stubbornly and well, in his mother's house amid \"the forlorn rags of growing old\" in 1969, aged 47, with the starburst of his early fame already faded.</p> <p>Yet he could not have been more wrong in his loss of hope. Kerouac's revolution has taken place, in a curious and partial way but on a great scale. He, along with Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando and James Dean, was one of the earliest talismen of the western world's affluent post-war youth culture. That culture, particularly in its time off, has gone not only on the road but into the sky, all over the world. The constituency for his work now runs into tens of millions: followers of the old hippy trail to India, gap-year students, backpackers, retirees roaming the US in motor caravans and almost every family heading west on a fly-drive package. </p> <p>All this has helped put Jack Kerouac - a man bad-mouthed by better-educated critics in his lifetime almost as badly as any writer since Keats - securely among the 20th century's top five best-selling authors, both in UK and American bookshops. In two millennial market research counts, he was placed respectively second and fourth, above Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and nearly all the other modern masters he envied.</p> <p>Among all post-war fiction, his autobiographical masterpiece On the Road comes top, alongside another 1950s youth generation text, JD Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. Such is the bond he forms with many of his readers that some of them would like to be able to reach beyond the grave and comfort his disappointed spirit by telling him this news. A man who thought so little of himself towards the end that he said, mocking his part-American Indian ancestry, \"I just brooding stagnant angry relic of the past I not big genius I big tin-eared Canuck,\" is now an undeniable classic.</p> <p>A lazy myth grew up about him after his reputation nose-dived and most of his work went out of print in the 1970s. This is that he indulged in \"typing, not writing\": that he produced his books on continuous rolls of paper in lightning bursts of befuddled free association, disregarding all rules of prose. According to the myth, he was lucky to find one good editor, Malcolm Cowley, who licked On the Road into shape. Beforehand and afterwards, much of his output was undisciplined garbage.</p> <p>Kerouac provided ammunition for this belief in some of his murkier theories about accumulating an \"infantile pile-up of scatological build-up of words till satisfaction is gained\". However - now that so much of his work can be read together in the new Penguin series - the myth itself evaporates. He used paper rolls as prosaically as we now use screens; he found his concentration broke if he had to keep changing paper sheets on a typewriter.</p> <p>In these five books, there is only one piece of sloppy writing, in a sketch called The Railroad Earth, where he tries to catch the speed, clang, flurry and danger of his time as a freight train brakeman. It needed a couple of rewrites. Yet, even as it stands, it is as good as the best of Hunter S Thompson and Bill Bryson rolled into one, better than almost any journalism being written today. Through all his experimentation in these books, his search for a de-formalised style which would keep faith with the world he saw - \"America as a poem, rather than as a place to struggle around and sweat in\" - he kept a remarkable ear for the cadences of a phrase or sentence, a sense of how to register in words the sheer, sweet flow of things.</p> <p>It was hardly ever a tin ear; and the temptation is to believe that this is because he was a Canuck. Kerouac, like Nabokov, had to learn English as a foreign language. Born into a French Canadian working-class family in Lowell, Massachusetts, he spoke a dialect, joual, until he was seven. </p> <p>He grew up an already carousing but brilliant boy football star who won a university scholarship and hoped to redeem the family fortunes by a career in insurance.

The story of carousing, football, of a consuming adolescent love affair and of the sense of apartness which gradually entered his soul is told in Maggie Cassidy (1959).</p> <p>His respectfully reviewed first published novel The Town and the City (1950) is a panoramic, conventional story about a small-town 1930s family like his. It has, however, stirrings of the future. One character discovers \"modern consciousness this gentle, invisible revolt in America\". Another passage traces the origin of his generation's \"irresponsible wanderlust of the soul\" to the troop movements of the war, which began when Kerouac was 17:</p> <blockquote> \"The great wartime wanderings of Americans were just beginning. Great troop trains rumbled by in the night everywhere In far-away towns where eleven o'clock had once been silence and the swish of treeleaves and the sleepy rush of Pinefork Creek, now it was the crowds of warworkers hurrying for the buses and the midnight shift at the vast swooping sheds three miles out of town.\" </blockquote> <p>In 1946, when Kerouac was already on the road, came the most influential meeting of his life - with Neal Cassady. Cassady, four years younger, was a charismatic ex-car thief with sincere mystical leanings and the looks of a young Paul Newman. While not much of a writer, he was an \"angelheaded hipster\", the true King of the Beats - though the press later gave Kerouac that title - and also a king of the road, a virtuoso driver who hurtled across the continent between wives, mistresses and multiple children like a blind force of nature.</p> <p>But it was Kerouac who minutely noticed the people and landscapes on the way, slowly forming a style, under Cassady's influence, which would gather and epitomise them on a typewriter after the journeys ended:</p> <blockquote> \"So in America when the sun goes down and I sit on the old, broken-down river pier watching the long, long skies over New Jersey and sense all that raw land that rolls in one unbelievable huge bulge over to the West Coast, and all that road going, all the people dreaming in the immensity of it just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in, and nobody, nobody knows what's going to happen to anybody besides the forlorn rags of growing old.\" (From On the Road) </blockquote> <p>On the Road flows with the juices of youth. It finishes with marriage and a putting down of roots, which Kerouac then expected for himself. But the book took six years to find a publisher. By then, early middle age, drink and family griefs were pressing on his spirit. Celebrity brought little except rubberneckers, notoriety, scroungers and more money for drink.</p> <p>Nevertheless, his mature strengths emerge in his next book, The Dharma Bums (1959). He is weak-willed, with a fragile ego easily put down by people or events. Yet he constantly rebounds into a vivid, intensely joyful and contagious empathy with nature and human beings. The book - in which he tries with intermittent devotion to live as a celibate Buddhist \"holy fool\", convinced that procreation brings only death and loss - contains his two best passages of writing, about climbing in California with friends, and two months alone as a mountain fire watcher in the High Cascades. He has the knack, learned from Cassady's letters to him, of telling us about these things as if we were his closest friends. </p> <p>Big Sur, published in 1962, is important in rounding off this main period of his work. It reveals how shocked to the quick he was, on his last attempt at hitchhiking, to find that the cars had no room for him because they were full of families on scenic outings. What he understandably failed to see was that this increasing mobility and curiosity, as people all over the west recovered from the aftermath of war and began to go out of doors again, would guarantee his own survival as a writer.</p> <p>Big Sur has been misleadingly oversold as an account of the Beat Generation's final crack-up through excess. But, by today's standards at least, Big Sur is no more than an account of the mild alcoholic heebie-jeebies, from which Kerouac as usual rebounded.

      "bodyText": "Forty years ago Jack Kerouac wrote a heartsick, but deeply premature, epitaph for what he called the \"special idea of footwalking freedom\" in America. This was the freedom of the wanderer, the hobo, the bum, the beatnik, the hitchhiker, the world of those who in his time went on the road. Kerouac himself had been every kind of wanderer since his youth began in the second world war. His books spring from the wonder and solitude of that experience. He and a friend, poet Alan Snyder, once saw \"a vision of a great rucksack revolution by millions of young Americans\", bursting from their prison of consumer materialism. But that hope had gone when he wrote his book of essays and sketches, Lonesome Traveller, in 1960. \"I myself was a hobo,\" he said, \"but I had to give it up because of the increasing television stories about the abominableness of strangers with packs. \"You can't be alone even in the primitive wilderness any more. There's always a helicopter As far as I am concerned, the only thing to do is to sit in a room and get drunk.\" Which is more or less what he did. He died of drink, still writing stubbornly and well, in his mother's house amid \"the forlorn rags of growing old\" in 1969, aged 47, with the starburst of his early fame already faded. Yet he could not have been more wrong in his loss of hope. Kerouac's revolution has taken place, in a curious and partial way but on a great scale. He, along with Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando and James Dean, was one of the earliest talismen of the western world's affluent post-war youth culture. That culture, particularly in its time off, has gone not only on the road but into the sky, all over the world. The constituency for his work now runs into tens of millions: followers of the old hippy trail to India, gap-year students, backpackers, retirees roaming the US in motor caravans and almost every family heading west on a fly-drive package. All this has helped put Jack Kerouac - a man bad-mouthed by better-educated critics in his lifetime almost as badly as any writer since Keats - securely among the 20th century's top five best-selling authors, both in UK and American bookshops. In two millennial market research counts, he was placed respectively second and fourth, above Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and nearly all the other modern masters he envied. Among all post-war fiction, his autobiographical masterpiece On the Road comes top, alongside another 1950s youth generation text, JD Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. Such is the bond he forms with many of his readers that some of them would like to be able to reach beyond the grave and comfort his disappointed spirit by telling him this news. A man who thought so little of himself towards the end that he said, mocking his part-American Indian ancestry, \"I just brooding stagnant angry relic of the past I not big genius I big tin-eared Canuck,\" is now an undeniable classic. A lazy myth grew up about him after his reputation nose-dived and most of his work went out of print in the 1970s. This is that he indulged in \"typing, not writing\": that he produced his books on continuous rolls of paper in lightning bursts of befuddled free association, disregarding all rules of prose. According to the myth, he was lucky to find one good editor, Malcolm Cowley, who licked On the Road into shape. Beforehand and afterwards, much of his output was undisciplined garbage. Kerouac provided ammunition for this belief in some of his murkier theories about accumulating an \"infantile pile-up of scatological build-up of words till satisfaction is gained\". However - now that so much of his work can be read together in the new Penguin series - the myth itself evaporates. He used paper rolls as prosaically as we now use screens; he found his concentration broke if he had to keep changing paper sheets on a typewriter. In these five books, there is only one piece of sloppy writing, in a sketch called The Railroad Earth, where he tries to catch the speed, clang, flurry and danger of his time as a freight train brakeman. It needed a couple of rewrites. Yet, even as it stands, it is as good as the best of Hunter S Thompson and Bill Bryson rolled into one, better than almost any journalism being written today. Through all his experimentation in these books, his search for a de-formalised style which would keep faith with the world he saw - \"America as a poem, rather than as a place to struggle around and sweat in\" - he kept a remarkable ear for the cadences of a phrase or sentence, a sense of how to register in words the sheer, sweet flow of things. It was hardly ever a tin ear; and the temptation is to believe that this is because he was a Canuck. Kerouac, like Nabokov, had to learn English as a foreign language.

He grew up an already carousing but brilliant boy football star who won a university scholarship and hoped to redeem the family fortunes by a career in insurance. But he dropped out to begin writing. The story of carousing, football, of a consuming adolescent love affair and of the sense of apartness which gradually entered his soul is told in Maggie Cassidy (1959).

      "body": "<p>About a year ago something astonishing happened in the world of book best-seller lists. For more than a decade these had found increasingly accurate ways of listing exactly which new books sold best in a particular week. Now we can vastly extend this timescale and come close to naming authoritatively the titles which have established themselves as the milestone books of the 20th century. The results yield huge surprises.</p> <p>The pantheon of great modern books was, until recently, decided by the opinion of critics, scholars and writers; and they tended to come up with results which readers felt were inherently unlikely. In fiction particularly, their lists were often headed by esteemed but not always fully read early texts of literary modernism like James Joyce's Ulysses and William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, piously followed by one or other of DH Lawrence's novels.</p> <p>Then, only three years ago, in the run-up to the millennium, mass polls of readers began to be held. These threw spanners into the academic works. The first, a survey of 25,000 readers by Waterstone's, found that Britain's favourite story of the century was JRR Tolkien's critically dismissed Lord of the Rings trilogy, with two very recent popular bestsellers, Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting and Jung Chang's Wild Swans, highly placed. Ernest Hemingway, TS Eliot, Samuel Beckett and Thomas Mann failed to get into the top 100 titles nominated.</p> <p>But only late last year did a near-definitive method of measuring milestones emerge, based on the bar-coded details of your purchase on computers. These details are downloaded weekly to the book trade's main market research agency, Whitaker BookTrack. BookTrack uses this data chiefly to compile current weekly bestseller lists of up to 20 titles which it sells to newspapers. But its computers, in Farnham, Surrey, now log purchases of all the 1.4 million books in print in the UK.</p> <p>If you dig deeply enough into this unpublished data, you can assemble a whole gallery of snapshots of the weekly tastes of 30m British book buyers. In 20th century classic fiction (which, to give a book time to establish itself securely, I've defined as fiction published before 1960) the picture is fascinating.</p> <p>Here, chosen by the voice of the people rather than the voice of critics, are the top 20 milestones which emerged just before the end of the century:</p> <p>1.

      "bodyText": "About a year ago something astonishing happened in the world of book best-seller lists. For more than a decade these had found increasingly accurate ways of listing exactly which new books sold best in a particular week. Now we can vastly extend this timescale and come close to naming authoritatively the titles which have established themselves as the milestone books of the 20th century. The results yield huge surprises. The pantheon of great modern books was, until recently, decided by the opinion of critics, scholars and writers; and they tended to come up with results which readers felt were inherently unlikely. In fiction particularly, their lists were often headed by esteemed but not always fully read early texts of literary modernism like James Joyce's Ulysses and William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, piously followed by one or other of DH Lawrence's novels. Then, only three years ago, in the run-up to the millennium, mass polls of readers began to be held. These threw spanners into the academic works. The first, a survey of 25,000 readers by Waterstone's, found that Britain's favourite story of the century was JRR Tolkien's critically dismissed Lord of the Rings trilogy, with two very recent popular bestsellers, Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting and Jung Chang's Wild Swans, highly placed. Ernest Hemingway, TS Eliot, Samuel Beckett and Thomas Mann failed to get into the top 100 titles nominated. But only late last year did a near-definitive method of measuring milestones emerge, based on the bar-coded details of your purchase on computers. These details are downloaded weekly to the book trade's main market research agency, Whitaker BookTrack. BookTrack uses this data chiefly to compile current weekly bestseller lists of up to 20 titles which it sells to newspapers. But its computers, in Farnham, Surrey, now log purchases of all the 1.4 million books in print in the UK. If you dig deeply enough into this unpublished data, you can assemble a whole gallery of snapshots of the weekly tastes of 30m British book buyers. In 20th century classic fiction (which, to give a book time to establish itself securely, I've defined as fiction published before 1960) the picture is fascinating. Here, chosen by the voice of the people rather than the voice of critics, are the top 20 milestones which emerged just before the end of the century: 1. The Catcher in the Rye (JD Salinger 1951) 2. Of Mice and Men (John Steinbeck 1937) 3. Brave New World (Aldous Huxley 1932) 4. On the Road (Jack Kerouac 1957) 5. The Hobbit (JRR Tolkien 1937) 6. Lord of the Flies (William Golding 1954) 7. A Farewell to Arms (Ernest Hemingway 1929) 8. Lord of the Rings (JRR Tolkien 1954-55) 9. Heart of Darkness (Joseph Conrad 1902) 10. 1984 (George Orwell 1949) 11. The Great Gatsby (Scott Fitzgerald 1925) 12. Cold Comfort Farm (Stella Gibbons (1932) 13. Dubliners (James Joyce (1914) 14. Brighton Rock (Graham Greene 1938) 15. From Russia with Love (Ian Fleming 1957) 16. Ulysses (James Joyce 1922) 17. Lolita (Vladimir Nabokov 1955) 18. Brideshead Revisited (Evelyn Waugh 1945) 19. A Room with a View (EM Forster 1908) 20.

      "body": "<p>I met Primo Levi at his home in Turin one hot summer's day in 1986. He was in shirt sleeves for the interview, and the tattoo '74517' was visible on his left forearm. 'A typical German talent for classification,' he said. The humour seemed bleak but characteristic. </p> <p>In February 1944 Levi was deported to Auschwitz with 650 other Jews (of which only 490 have since been identified). Following his return to northern Italy in late 1945 the need to bear witness was so intense that he would write on scraps of paper anywhere - in factories, trams and trains. Driven to tell his story, Levi completed If This is a Man within 10 months. No other work conveys the unique horror of the Nazi genocide more directly and profoundly, or interrogates our recent moral history so incisively. For its quiet testimony of man's cruelty to man, it remains one of the essential books of our age.</p> <p>Primo Levi was just 27 when his Auschwitz memoir was published in Turin. No one wanted to read it; talk of the war and deportation was taboo in post-Fascist Italy. Levi's first book nevertheless was a remarkable literary document that revealed wide-ranging influences from Dante to Darwin. The prose had a beautiful lucidity which owed much to the author's background in chemistry. A bright and precocious student, Levi had graduated with honours in chemistry in Turin in 1941. He wrote his sentences with a chemist's attention to molecular structure and balance. </p> <p>All his life Levi was prone to periodic black moods. On April 11 1987, more than 42 years after his rescue from Auschwitz, he fell to his death. Newspapers reported that Levi had pitched himself down the stairwell of his Turin apartment; his body was found at the foot of a lift shaft, four flights below. Though Levi had suffered depression long before he was deported, many were quick to attribute his suicide to Auschwitz. In America there was even some moral outrage at his self-destruction. The efficacy of Levi's words, it was reckoned, had been cancelled by his suicide; Levi had cheated his readers with a last and terrible act of denial. The belief remains as vulgar as it is short-sighted. Levi's books remain, and those books are matchless. </p> <p>In spite of his responsibilities as a chemist, Levi was committed to the writing which finally brought him international acclaim. His poems, science fiction, essays and short stories are now loved by a wide readership for their intelligence and wise humanity. Yet it was Auschwitz, and the moral and material ruins of post-Nazi Europe, that provided Levi with his most enduring subject matter. His best books draw on autobiography. </p> <p>The book that made Levi's name abroad was The Periodic Table when it appeared in 1975. A collection of semi-autobiographical tales loosely structured around the chemical table of elements, the book is wonderfully daring. In prose of tight, functional elegance, all Levi's vital experience is here, from his deportation to Auschwitz to his post-war recovery as a writer and a chemist. The Periodic Table bridges the two cultures in new and thrilling ways. Its extraordinary shifts of tone, from learned scientific treatise to epic war narrative, reflect Levi's eclectic reading and mesmeric story-telling gifts. </p> <p>The memoir also pays tender homage to Turin. Levi spent most of his life in his birthplace and the city influenced him in a number of ways. Turin is famously symmetrical - all streets intersect at right angles - and something of its austere, checkerboard design infuses his books with their carefully wrought prose and precise craft. The Turinese are renowned for their industry and measured, methodical ways. In their clipped, Frenchified dialect they like to say: 'Esageroma nen' - don't exaggerate. Levi upheld this faith in the virtue of concision. </p> <p>His birthplace has a dark reputation, though. Many of De Chirico's surrealist landscapes, with their sinister broken statues and endless colonnades, are portraits of Levi's Turin. The city's geometry need not square with rational behaviour. Friedrich Nietzsche reputedly went mad in Turin; before Levi, the Piedmontese poet Cesare Pavese took his life there. Yet Levi remained deeply attached to Turin. Generations of his family had lived under its influence. He met his wife and raised two children there.</p> <p>Levi had scarcely begun his studies at Turin University in October 1937 when Mussolini prepared for anti-Jewish legislation. The Italian dictator had been disdainful of Hitler and the Nazi 'barbarians' north of the Alps. However, a fatal new alliance was forged in 1936 when Italy sided with Germany in the Spanish Civil War. Now that Mussolini had hitched his carnival chariot to the Fuhrer's funeral hearse, Italian Jewry was in grave danger. By March-April 1938 the Fascist media united to create an all-out onslaught of racial abuse. Levi's family listened fearfully that spring as the Jewish Question was endlessly discussed in Fascist debates on the wireless. Like most Italian Jews they hoped that Mussolini's anti-semitic propaganda would 'blow over'. They couldn't imagine how much worse was to come. </p> <p>On July 14 1938 came a turning point in the fortunes of Italian Jewry, which eventually led to Levi's deportation. The news that bright July morning, splashed on the front page of Italian newspapers, was headed 'The Manifesto of Racist Scientists'. Commissioned by Mussolini and signed by a group of Italian pseudo-biologists, the document earnestly demonstrated that Italian Jews did not belong to the Italian race. Instead they were a contaminant akin to the Nazis' Fremdksrper - an alien within the state. </p> <p>Levi's family reacted with shock, confusion, then incredulity. More than 10,000 of Italy's Jews were Fascist party members - roughly a third of the country's adult Jewish population. Mussolini had supported the bourgeois-patriotic ideals of Italian Jews, but now after 17 years of Fascist rule he had betrayed his own most loyal subjects. </p> <p>The dictator's race police quickly went to work. Data was gathered on every living Jew in Italy - name, address, profession - and set down with lapidary coldness in official communiques. This information proved invaluable for the Germans when they occupied northern Italy in autumn 1943 and began to root out Jews for deportation. </p> <p>For the first time in his 19 years, Levi was forced to acknowledge the stigma of his racial origin. Italian Jews were different from Italians not just because they were Jews, but because they were non-Aryans. And who exactly were the Aryans? No one in Italy seemed to know, though sure enough Fascist notices began to appear in Turin: 'Jews are not welcome here.' All over Italy it was the same. Within 18 months of Mussolini's race legislation some 5,500 Jews had left Italy - more than one 10th of the country's Jewish community.

      "bodyText": "I met Primo Levi at his home in Turin one hot summer's day in 1986. He was in shirt sleeves for the interview, and the tattoo '74517' was visible on his left forearm. 'A typical German talent for classification,' he said. The humour seemed bleak but characteristic. In February 1944 Levi was deported to Auschwitz with 650 other Jews (of which only 490 have since been identified). Following his return to northern Italy in late 1945 the need to bear witness was so intense that he would write on scraps of paper anywhere - in factories, trams and trains. Driven to tell his story, Levi completed If This is a Man within 10 months. No other work conveys the unique horror of the Nazi genocide more directly and profoundly, or interrogates our recent moral history so incisively. For its quiet testimony of man's cruelty to man, it remains one of the essential books of our age. Primo Levi was just 27 when his Auschwitz memoir was published in Turin. No one wanted to read it; talk of the war and deportation was taboo in post-Fascist Italy. Levi's first book nevertheless was a remarkable literary document that revealed wide-ranging influences from Dante to Darwin. The prose had a beautiful lucidity which owed much to the author's background in chemistry. A bright and precocious student, Levi had graduated with honours in chemistry in Turin in 1941. He wrote his sentences with a chemist's attention to molecular structure and balance. All his life Levi was prone to periodic black moods. On April 11 1987, more than 42 years after his rescue from Auschwitz, he fell to his death. Newspapers reported that Levi had pitched himself down the stairwell of his Turin apartment; his body was found at the foot of a lift shaft, four flights below. Though Levi had suffered depression long before he was deported, many were quick to attribute his suicide to Auschwitz. In America there was even some moral outrage at his self-destruction. The efficacy of Levi's words, it was reckoned, had been cancelled by his suicide; Levi had cheated his readers with a last and terrible act of denial. The belief remains as vulgar as it is short-sighted. Levi's books remain, and those books are matchless. In spite of his responsibilities as a chemist, Levi was committed to the writing which finally brought him international acclaim. His poems, science fiction, essays and short stories are now loved by a wide readership for their intelligence and wise humanity. Yet it was Auschwitz, and the moral and material ruins of post-Nazi Europe, that provided Levi with his most enduring subject matter. His best books draw on autobiography. The book that made Levi's name abroad was The Periodic Table when it appeared in 1975. A collection of semi-autobiographical tales loosely structured around the chemical table of elements, the book is wonderfully daring. In prose of tight, functional elegance, all Levi's vital experience is here, from his deportation to Auschwitz to his post-war recovery as a writer and a chemist. The Periodic Table bridges the two cultures in new and thrilling ways. Its extraordinary shifts of tone, from learned scientific treatise to epic war narrative, reflect Levi's eclectic reading and mesmeric story-telling gifts. The memoir also pays tender homage to Turin. Levi spent most of his life in his birthplace and the city influenced him in a number of ways. Turin is famously symmetrical - all streets intersect at right angles - and something of its austere, checkerboard design infuses his books with their carefully wrought prose and precise craft. The Turinese are renowned for their industry and measured, methodical ways. In their clipped, Frenchified dialect they like to say: 'Esageroma nen' - don't exaggerate. Levi upheld this faith in the virtue of concision. His birthplace has a dark reputation, though. Many of De Chirico's surrealist landscapes, with their sinister broken statues and endless colonnades, are portraits of Levi's Turin. The city's geometry need not square with rational behaviour. Friedrich Nietzsche reputedly went mad in Turin; before Levi, the Piedmontese poet Cesare Pavese took his life there. Yet Levi remained deeply attached to Turin. Generations of his family had lived under its influence. He met his wife and raised two children there. Levi had scarcely begun his studies at Turin University in October 1937 when Mussolini prepared for anti-Jewish legislation. The Italian dictator had been disdainful of Hitler and the Nazi 'barbarians' north of the Alps. However, a fatal new alliance was forged in 1936 when Italy sided with Germany in the Spanish Civil War. Now that Mussolini had hitched his carnival chariot to the Fuhrer's funeral hearse, Italian Jewry was in grave danger. By March-April 1938 the Fascist media united to create an all-out onslaught of racial abuse. Levi's family listened fearfully that spring as the Jewish Question was endlessly discussed in Fascist debates on the wireless. Like most Italian Jews they hoped that Mussolini's anti-semitic propaganda would 'blow over'. They couldn't imagine how much worse was to come. On July 14 1938 came a turning point in the fortunes of Italian Jewry, which eventually led to Levi's deportation. The news that bright July morning, splashed on the front page of Italian newspapers, was headed 'The Manifesto of Racist Scientists'. Commissioned by Mussolini and signed by a group of Italian pseudo-biologists, the document earnestly demonstrated that Italian Jews did not belong to the Italian race. Instead they were a contaminant akin to the Nazis' Fremdksrper - an alien within the state. Levi's family reacted with shock, confusion, then incredulity. More than 10,000 of Italy's Jews were Fascist party members - roughly a third of the country's adult Jewish population. Mussolini had supported the bourgeois-patriotic ideals of Italian Jews, but now after 17 years of Fascist rule he had betrayed his own most loyal subjects. The dictator's race police quickly went to work. Data was gathered on every living Jew in Italy - name, address, profession - and set down with lapidary coldness in official communiques. This information proved invaluable for the Germans when they occupied northern Italy in autumn 1943 and began to root out Jews for deportation. For the first time in his 19 years, Levi was forced to acknowledge the stigma of his racial origin. Italian Jews were different from Italians not just because they were Jews, but because they were non-Aryans. And who exactly were the Aryans? No one in Italy seemed to know, though sure enough Fascist notices began to appear in Turin: 'Jews are not welcome here.' All over Italy it was the same. Within 18 months of Mussolini's race legislation some 5,500 Jews had left Italy - more than one 10th of the country's Jewish community. On November 29 1938, the Jewish publisher Angelo Formiggini threw himself from the belltower of Modena cathedral in a bid to draw the world's attention to the persecution. News of his suicide was suppressed. The pressure continued throughout 1938 as Mussolini issued ever more severe restrictions.

      "body": "<p>John Steinbeck wrote 'big books' and 'little books'. With one exception, his little books have proved to be more popular than the grander, symbol-heavy novels that the author may have believed to be the more profound. Who would not rather relax in Cannery Row than appeal To a God Unknown? Or dawdle in Sweet Thursday rather than toil in The Winter of Our Discontent? The exception is The Grapes of Wrath (1939), a monument in American literature, a novel of political engagement which none the less avoids the abiding problems of protest fiction, speaking from inside the individual characters' heads, and fulfilling the first obligation of the novelist: to tell a good story. That story of poor white migrants is Steinbeck's finest sustained performance, for which the earlier tragedies and social comedies appear in retrospect to have been preparation.</p> <p>The opening sentences of The Grapes of Wrath are masterful in the way they evoke not just a landscape, but also the way of life of the people who have tried to coax a living from it:</p> <blockquote> 'To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth. The plows crossed and recrossed the rivulet marks. The last rains lifted the corn quickly and scattered weed colonies and grass alongside the sides of the roads so that the gray country and the dark red country began to disappear under a green cover. In the last part of May the sky grew pale... and as the sky became pale, so the earth became pale...' </blockquote> <p>There is probably no writer in English this century who has mined so much poetry out of poverty, as Steinbeck. The Joads, the 'Okie' family at the heart of The Grapes of Wrath, might as well be specks of dust in the parched land they are struggling to get away from: no one cares about them, no one wants to employ them; they have no money, no possessions - even the home they abandoned was one half of someone else'sll they have is the prospect, the mirage, of the Promised Land.</p> <p>They are 'white trash': an appalling term, which Steinbeck would surely have regarded as not just disrespectful but sacrilegious. On almost every page, he conjures a scene which confirms the Joads as flesh-and-blood creations. Sometimes all it takes is a dash of absurdity which strikes a realistic note (Steinbeck had a sharp eye for the absurd). When Grandpa Joad expires on the trail out West, the lapsed preacher Casy is called on to say a few words over the corpse. 'This here ol' man jus' lived a life and jus' died out of it,' he intones. 'I don't know whether he was good or bad, but that don't matter much. He was alive, an' that's what mattersn' now he's dead, an' that don't matter.'</p> <p>The colours on the flag Steinbeck flies are decency, humility, affection. In every case, they speak for themselves, but in many of his books Steinbeck felt it necessary to insert a little homily on the communal virtues early in the narrative. In Tortilla Flat, his story of Mexican-American peasants, or paisanos, living in Monterey, it is more explicit than in most: 'The paisanos are clean of commercialism, free of the complicated systems of American business, and, having nothing that can be stolen, exploited or mortgaged, that system has not attacked them very vigorously.' This was not considered very American, in an era during which 'commercialism' was regarded as the social dynamo; but it is very Steinbeck.</p> <p>Steinbeck has always appealed in particular to the young. He has a love of innocence, a liking for mischief, and an idealism which can be relied on to reach beyond practical considerations into a zone of pure good. He was fond of talking about his works in terms of musical form - structured like a symphony, and so on - but he is always better when he is Woody Guthrie than when trying to be Beethoven.</p> <p>Readers of Steinbeck should not expect to encounter characters who embody the moral (and racial) ambivalence of Faulkner's Joe Christmas, for example, the desperate white-skinned black man with the suggestive name from Light in August; or Hemingway's Jake Barnes, from The Sun Also Rises. Or even the enigmatic Jay Gatsby, personification of a whole range of New World pathologies.</p> <p>In the Steinbeck universe, it is always an easier matter to distinguish good from bad, than in that of Hemingway or Faulkner or Fitzgerald, which no doubt partly accounts for Steinbeck's poor showing in academic respectability in recent decades. We know exactly where we stand when Lennie falls foul of Curley in Of Mice and Men. In the work of other writers, there is often irony or ambivalence for the reader to unpick, but in Steinbeck one learns quickly to take the virtue - and the vice - at face value.</p> <p>So good a descriptive writer is he, that it is not necessary to climb out of the armchair to know what Steinbeck Country looks and feels and smells like:</p> <blockquote> 'The sun was coming over the ridge now, glaring on the whitewash of the houses and barns, making the wet grass blaze softly. Behind him, in the tall sagebrush, the birds were scampering on the ground, making a great noise among the dry leaves; the squirrels piped shrilly on the side-hills. Jody looked along at the farm buildings. He felt an uncertainty in the air.' </blockquote> <p>The uncertainty here involves the secret gift of the red pony, about to be revealed in the exquisite little book of that name. Jodey's devotion to it is almost painful to witness, the more so as he learns a hard lesson when the pony falls ill, and Billy the farmhand, Jodey's once infallible hero, promises to save its life. Steinbeck was guilty occasionally of mawkishness - particularly in the later books, when celebrity, partly unwanted, had distanced him from his subject matter - but although he looked caringly on the poor, he strove to avoid condescension. There is bitterness in Tom Joad's explanation of why his father never learned to write, but there is wit, as well: 'Ever' time Pa seen writin', somebody took somepin away from him.'</p> <p>John Steinbeck did not suffer the material deprivations of his creations. He was born in Salinas, California, in 1902, and later spent six years ducking in and out of an English degree at Stanford University. His first novel, Cup of Gold, was published in 1929. It sold in the low hundreds. The next two did scarcely any better.</p> <p>It was with Tortilla Flat, his fourth book, that Steinbeck began to find his own voice, and with it a degree of success. The Grapes of Wrath won a Pulitzer Prize in 1939, became a massive bestseller and was made into a film with Henry Fonda. Several other books were brought to the screen as well. Steinbeck is, in a sense, a cinematic writer, in that he favoured spare description, short scenes each with a central action, and vivid, characterful dialogue; but none of his novels has been superseded by its movie version. The weather of Steinbeck Country may be felt only in the language.</p> <p>The voice he found with Tortilla Flat was not his own at all - it was a Hispanic voice, and in order to make it seem authentic, Steinbeck contrived a strange device. When Danny unexpectedly inherits a house, his friend Pilon, fearing the worst, says: 'Let money come and charity flies away. So it is with thee, my once-friend. Thou art lifted above thy friends. Thou art a man of property. Thou wilt forget the friends who shared everything with thee, even thy brandy.' Before long, the reader gets used to this convention, and the deadpan wisdom wrapped up in it: 'If all the dew were diamonds, we would be very rich. We would be drunk all our lives,' Pablo says, adopting a tone of sagacity to make a basic point about his own needs. This pearl receives the reply it deserves, from Pilon: 'Everybody would then have too many diamonds. There would be no price for them, but wine always costs money.' And 'besides', as someone else says, 'the bottle is empty'.</p> <p>Tortilla Flat was converted into white Americana 10 years later in Cannery Rowlthough set in the 1930s, this short novel was written in 1945, and it came like a breath of post-war fresh air. It is based in the same part of California as Tortilla Flat. For Cannery Row, Steinbeck said, he just opened the pages 'and let the stories crawl in'.</p> <p>That's nonsense, of course: it is a carefully crafted, plotless book, which moves along with the kind of narrative ease that does not come without skill and experience. The cast consists of bums, good-time girls, the shopkeeper Lee Chong who specialises in a whisky called Old Tennis Shoes, and intellectuals such as Doc the biologist and Henri the painter, who used to work in 'glue, iron rust and chicken feathers', but changed to nutshells after an epiphany while listening to Doc's recordings of Gregorian chant. The book represents a tidepool containing the flotsam and jetsam of the local world, much like the tidepools Doc examines for his studies in biology. In one of these, halfway through the novel, Doc has a shocking vision of death - and it provides an anchor for a story which is otherwise all humour and pathos.</p> <p>Steinbeck took other chances in Cannery Row. There were few novels at the time which would risk passages such as Steinbeck's amusing and probably accurate disquisition on the 'moral, physical, and aesthetic effect' of the Model T Ford: 'Two generations of Americans know more about the Ford coil than the clitoris, about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars.'</p> <p>A follow-up to Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday, was published in 1954, for those who just couldn't get enough of Mack and the boys and their ingenious schemes, such as running a Model T uphill in reverse, when first gear has insufficient purchase.</p> <p>By then, Steinbeck was established as one of the leading contemporary American authors, on his way to the Nobel Prize, which he was granted in 1962 (Faulkner had won it in 1949, and Hemingway in 1954). His widespread appeal is based on his honest negotiation of an uncomplicated (though not unhazardous) moral maze, but there may be another reason, to do with his distinctive Americanness.</p> <p>Steinbeck was anything but avant garde. Inclined by nature to sing a plain man's song, he made gentle experiments with narrative rhythm - as in the novella which tells the same story three times in three different historical and social settings. But such experiments hesitate before the hard-edge modernism which might risk unpopularity, or incomprehensibility, such as Faulkner's thrilling adventures in form provoked in the 1920s and early 30s, and which makes much 20th century literature of the post-Ulysses, post-Waste Land era 'difficult'.</p> <p>Hemingway, Dos Passos and Fitzgerald also absorbed modern European influences, to an extent that Steinbeck was temperamentally inclined to refuse. There is no equivalent in his apprenticeship to the part played in Hemingway's early life by Gertrude Stein, or in Faulkner's education by Joyce. By comparison, Steinbeck seems like homegrown stuff, almost folksy. It is a risk he was happy to run, and he would not have seen the comment as a criticism.</p> <p>It is this thoroughgoing Americanness that brought Steinbeck alongside Jack Kerouac as a standard author in the hip curriculum of the 1960s. The hero of Kerouac's Californian Beat novel The Dharma Bums, Japhy Ryder, an American Zen Buddhist with solitary tendencies and a store of exotic expertise, has much in common with Doc of Cannery Row. Doc also nods occasionally in the direction of the East (rather than Europe). Indeed, viewed side by side today with Kerouac's Japhy (who was based on the poet Gary Snyder), Doc seems less stuck in his own era, more recognisably modern. Steinbeck made a 1960s gesture of his own when he took to the road, at the age of 58, 'in search of America' - much to the alarm of his wife. He was accompanied only by his dog, after whom the resulting book was named: Travels with Charley, published in 1962.</p> <p>By then, Steinbeck was regarded with suspicion by a set of guardians of a different 'America' to the one he had been charting and describing ever since he raised his first cup of gold to the country in the 1920s. Steinbeck's solidarity with strikers and migrant labourers, and his corresponding antipathy to feral capitalism, made him a target of the FBI, under J Edgar Hoover. </p> <p>Steinbeck was as American as they come, but he was 'unAmerican' in the eyes of the communist-obsessed director. 'This land, this red land, is us,' he wrote in The Grapes of Wrath, the book which first got him labelled a communist sympathiser; 'every one a drum major leading a parade of hurts, marching with our bitternessnd some day - the armies of bitterness will all be going the same way. And they'll all walk together, and there'll be a dead terror from it.'</p> <p>In his book, Dangerous Dossiers: Exposing the Secret War Against America's Greatest Authors (1988), Herbert Mitgang notes that while the FBI file on Steinbeck does not take note of the fact that he received the 'international literary honour' of the Nobel Prize, it stresses that 'because many of Steinbeck's writings portrayed an extremely sordid and poverty-stricken side of American life, they were reprinted in both German and Russian and used by the Nazis and Soviets as propaganda against America.'</p> <p>An open-and-shut case of guilt by association. In reality, Steinbeck's writings are neither pro-Soviet nor anti-American. They form a photograph album of America, and in particular of that splendid region, Steinbeck Country, from which countless literary travellers have gratefully sent a postcard home.</p>",

He has a love of innocence, a liking for mischief, and an idealism which can be relied on to reach beyond practical considerations into a zone of pure good. He was fond of talking about his works in terms of musical form - structured like a symphony, and so on - but he is always better when he is Woody Guthrie than when trying to be Beethoven. Readers of Steinbeck should not expect to encounter characters who embody the moral (and racial) ambivalence of Faulkner's Joe Christmas, for example, the desperate white-skinned black man with the suggestive name from Light in August; or Hemingway's Jake Barnes, from The Sun Also Rises. Or even the enigmatic Jay Gatsby, personification of a whole range of New World pathologies. In the Steinbeck universe, it is always an easier matter to distinguish good from bad, than in that of Hemingway or Faulkner or Fitzgerald, which no doubt partly accounts for Steinbeck's poor showing in academic respectability in recent decades. We know exactly where we stand when Lennie falls foul of Curley in Of Mice and Men. In the work of other writers, there is often irony or ambivalence for the reader to unpick, but in Steinbeck one learns quickly to take the virtue - and the vice - at face value. So good a descriptive writer is he, that it is not necessary to climb out of the armchair to know what Steinbeck Country looks and feels and smells like: 'The sun was coming over the ridge now, glaring on the whitewash of the houses and barns, making the wet grass blaze softly. Behind him, in the tall sagebrush, the birds were scampering on the ground, making a great noise among the dry leaves; the squirrels piped shrilly on the side-hills. Jody looked along at the farm buildings. He felt an uncertainty in the air.' The uncertainty here involves the secret gift of the red pony, about to be revealed in the exquisite little book of that name. Jodey's devotion to it is almost painful to witness, the more so as he learns a hard lesson when the pony falls ill, and Billy the farmhand, Jodey's once infallible hero, promises to save its life. Steinbeck was guilty occasionally of mawkishness - particularly in the later books, when celebrity, partly unwanted, had distanced him from his subject matter - but although he looked caringly on the poor, he strove to avoid condescension. There is bitterness in Tom Joad's explanation of why his father never learned to write, but there is wit, as well: 'Ever' time Pa seen writin', somebody took somepin away from him.' John Steinbeck did not suffer the material deprivations of his creations. He was born in Salinas, California, in 1902, and later spent six years ducking in and out of an English degree at Stanford University. His first novel, Cup of Gold, was published in 1929. It sold in the low hundreds. The next two did scarcely any better. It was with Tortilla Flat, his fourth book, that Steinbeck began to find his own voice, and with it a degree of success. The Grapes of Wrath won a Pulitzer Prize in 1939, became a massive bestseller and was made into a film with Henry Fonda. Several other books were brought to the screen as well. Steinbeck is, in a sense, a cinematic writer, in that he favoured spare description, short scenes each with a central action, and vivid, characterful dialogue; but none of his novels has been superseded by its movie version. The weather of Steinbeck Country may be felt only in the language. The voice he found with Tortilla Flat was not his own at all - it was a Hispanic voice, and in order to make it seem authentic, Steinbeck contrived a strange device. When Danny unexpectedly inherits a house, his friend Pilon, fearing the worst, says: 'Let money come and charity flies away. So it is with thee, my once-friend. Thou art lifted above thy friends. Thou art a man of property. Thou wilt forget the friends who shared everything with thee, even thy brandy.' Before long, the reader gets used to this convention, and the deadpan wisdom wrapped up in it: 'If all the dew were diamonds, we would be very rich. We would be drunk all our lives,' Pablo says, adopting a tone of sagacity to make a basic point about his own needs. This pearl receives the reply it deserves, from Pilon: 'Everybody would then have too many diamonds. There would be no price for them, but wine always costs money.' And 'besides', as someone else says, 'the bottle is empty'. Tortilla Flat was converted into white Americana 10 years later in Cannery Rowlthough set in the 1930s, this short novel was written in 1945, and it came like a breath of post-war fresh air. It is based in the same part of California as Tortilla Flat. For Cannery Row, Steinbeck said, he just opened the pages 'and let the stories crawl in'. That's nonsense, of course: it is a carefully crafted, plotless book, which moves along with the kind of narrative ease that does not come without skill and experience. The cast consists of bums, good-time girls, the shopkeeper Lee Chong who specialises in a whisky called Old Tennis Shoes, and intellectuals such as Doc the biologist and Henri the painter, who used to work in 'glue, iron rust and chicken feathers', but changed to nutshells after an epiphany while listening to Doc's recordings of Gregorian chant. The book represents a tidepool containing the flotsam and jetsam of the local world, much like the tidepools Doc examines for his studies in biology. In one of these, halfway through the novel, Doc has a shocking vision of death - and it provides an anchor for a story which is otherwise all humour and pathos. Steinbeck took other chances in Cannery Row. There were few novels at the time which would risk passages such as Steinbeck's amusing and probably accurate disquisition on the 'moral, physical, and aesthetic effect' of the Model T Ford: 'Two generations of Americans know more about the Ford coil than the clitoris, about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars.' A follow-up to Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday, was published in 1954, for those who just couldn't get enough of Mack and the boys and their ingenious schemes, such as running a Model T uphill in reverse, when first gear has insufficient purchase. By then, Steinbeck was established as one of the leading contemporary American authors, on his way to the Nobel Prize, which he was granted in 1962 (Faulkner had won it in 1949, and Hemingway in 1954). His widespread appeal is based on his honest negotiation of an uncomplicated (though not unhazardous) moral maze, but there may be another reason, to do with his distinctive Americanness. Steinbeck was anything but avant garde. Inclined by nature to sing a plain man's song, he made gentle experiments with narrative rhythm - as in the novella which tells the same story three times in three different historical and social settings. But such experiments hesitate before the hard-edge modernism which might risk unpopularity, or incomprehensibility, such as Faulkner's thrilling adventures in form provoked in the 1920s and early 30s, and which makes much 20th century literature of the post-Ulysses, post-Waste Land era 'difficult'. Hemingway, Dos Passos and Fitzgerald also absorbed modern European influences, to an extent that Steinbeck was temperamentally inclined to refuse. There is no equivalent in his apprenticeship to the part played in Hemingway's early life by Gertrude Stein, or in Faulkner's education by Joyce. By comparison, Steinbeck seems like homegrown stuff, almost folksy. It is a risk he was happy to run, and he would not have seen the comment as a criticism. It is this thoroughgoing Americanness that brought Steinbeck alongside Jack Kerouac as a standard author in the hip curriculum of the 1960s. The hero of Kerouac's Californian Beat novel The Dharma Bums, Japhy Ryder, an American Zen Buddhist with solitary tendencies and a store of exotic expertise, has much in common with Doc of Cannery Row. Doc also nods occasionally in the direction of the East (rather than Europe). Indeed, viewed side by side today with Kerouac's Japhy (who was based on the poet Gary Snyder), Doc seems less stuck in his own era, more recognisably modern. Steinbeck made a 1960s gesture of his own when he took to the road, at the age of 58, 'in search of America' - much to the alarm of his wife. He was accompanied only by his dog, after whom the resulting book was named: Travels with Charley, published in 1962. By then, Steinbeck was regarded with suspicion by a set of guardians of a different 'America' to the one he had been charting and describing ever since he raised his first cup of gold to the country in the 1920s. Steinbeck's solidarity with strikers and migrant labourers, and his corresponding antipathy to feral capitalism, made him a target of the FBI, under J Edgar Hoover. Steinbeck was as American as they come, but he was 'unAmerican' in the eyes of the communist-obsessed director. 'This land, this red land, is us,' he wrote in The Grapes of Wrath, the book which first got him labelled a communist sympathiser; 'every one a drum major leading a parade of hurts, marching with our bitternessnd some day - the armies of bitterness will all be going the same way. And they'll all walk together, and there'll be a dead terror from it.' In his book, Dangerous Dossiers: Exposing the Secret War Against America's Greatest Authors (1988), Herbert Mitgang notes that while the FBI file on Steinbeck does not take note of the fact that he received the 'international literary honour' of the Nobel Prize, it stresses that 'because many of Steinbeck's writings portrayed an extremely sordid and poverty-stricken side of American life, they were reprinted in both German and Russian and used by the Nazis and Soviets as propaganda against America.' An open-and-shut case of guilt by association. In reality, Steinbeck's writings are neither pro-Soviet nor anti-American. They form a photograph album of America, and in particular of that splendid region, Steinbeck Country, from which countless literary travellers have gratefully sent a postcard home.",

Nearly everyone soon learns that they must accept constraints of many kinds if they want to be seen as responsible adults.

Most of us, however, are aware from time to time of our own inner child fidgeting against its rules and demands, and Jean's novels speak to that awareness with startling immediacy. It was her childlike disposition that made her the extraordinary novelist she was - but in life it did often cause pain to her and those closest to her, and gave a good deal of trouble to many other people, including me.</p> <p>When Andr\u00e9 Deutsch Limited published Wide Sargasso Sea in 1966 Jean was 76. I, as their chief editor, had been in touch with her for eight years by then, and was to see a lot of her from then on. We reissued all her earlier work except for a few short stories, and we published her two last books. I feel a fraud when described as 'Jean Rhys's editor', because in her writing she was such a perfectionist that she needed no editing. But she did need a nanny.</p> <p>It was a task much less onerous than I expected it to be. Jean loved her daughter, Maryvonne Moerman, very much; but she was no better at motherhood than she was at filling hot-water bottles, so when she hinted that she might move to Rotterdam, where the Moermans lived, Maryvonne panicked. She came to London, took me to lunch, and told me that although she would continue to visit her mother, and could be called on in any emergency, she most definitely could not have her in Holland: 'It would be the end of my marriage.' So it was me, she said firmly, who would have to look after Jean. </p> <p>By then I had a clear idea of Jean's helplessness, so I knew there would be endless muddles to be sorted out and a constant need for reassurance. I would have to find her somewhere better to live than her dreadful little flimsy bungalow in Devonshire (this was never achieved because she always said: 'Better the devil I know' when it came to the point - but the bungalow was made much more comfortable). As soon as she had earned enough money to be taxed, I would have - oh God! - to deal with the resulting problems... </p> <p>No one who knew the history of Jean and Maryvonne could possibly blame Maryvonne for her attitude, but to say that I was dismayed is an understatement. </p> <p>As it turned out, my part of the job was easy in the end. Francis Wyndham, who had introduced me to Jean's work, was able to help her in many ways. Sonia Orwell was to do an enormous amount for her, and gradually the whole 'support team' expanded to include many other people who were drawn to Jean by their admiration of her work, some of whom were prepared to go to great lengths for her. None of us was unaware of how difficult she could be - and all of us were very fond of her. So my friend's question set me thinking.</p> <p>If you came upon Jean unexpectedly she was always sunk in her chair, gazing into space with a deeply sad expression. Her face would light up as she turned towards you, exclaiming: 'Oh darling - there you are!' as though she had given you up (she probably had - she expected to be let down).</p> <p>The once lovely girl had shrunk to a slightly distorted old woman with hands so cruelly twisted that she could hardly hold a pen, on whose body clothes sat awkwardly. The skin over her high cheekbones was still clear, her soft silvery hair was still pretty, but it was her huge, grey-blue, wide-apart eyes that showed how beautiful she had been - that made you sure there had always been an elusive, half inviting, half out-of-reach quality about her... something much more interesting than the prettiness of a Dresden doll, though 'the Dresden doll' was what she had once been called when she was a chorus girl in musical comedies.</p> <p>On bad days her talk could be querulous, but usually it was charming, seemed unreserved and intimate, although the field in which she was unreserved was narrow, partly because of an old-fashioned sense of decorum and partly because there were things in her past which she wanted to wipe out. She said that she had no sense of humour, but her enjoyment of the absurd was great, and she was the only person I ever knew who'd laugh till she cried. One thing she found very funny was when a critic attempted to impose a women's movement interpretation on her books: 'Women's Lib - me!' she'd say. Although when talking more seriously she always insisted that what her critics made of a writer's work was their business, not the writer's.</p> <p>About her own work she always said the same things: that what she aimed for was 'getting it right, getting it as it really was'; and that one must cut and cut and cut again. (These simple-sounding rules were, of course, not simple at all, being a convenient shorthand for a scrupulous and subtle precision and the fine art of implying more by less.) </p> <p>She would also say that ending a novel based on things that had really happened, as hers all were, was difficult because a novel must have shape, and real life usually has none - the ending of Good Morning, Midnight had given her a great deal of trouble, she said, which made her rather proud of it. Two of her statements, both made more than once, seem to be contradictory: if she really did hate having been good at writing because it was so difficult, how could she sometimes feel more like a pen being used than like a person using a pen, which sounds effortless even if frightening?</p> <p>She liked to pass on a tip given her by Ford Madox Ford when she was with him in Paris: when doubtful about a sentence, translate it into French - if it works in French it is good. (I never asked her if she had done this, but I suspect that it's nonsense, and that she hadn't.)</p> <p>I never heard her talking about other people's writing, beyond saying that a book was good, or that she did not much like it. To tear a bad book to pieces would have been as displeasing to her as unkind gossip, which she abhorred. She used to laugh at how often she had re-read The Prisoner of Zenda because books found for her in the Exeter library by a neighbour's daughter had proved unpalatable. No doubt, she said, The Prisoner was romantic rubbish, but it must be well written or she could not have read it so often.</p> <p>The most fascinating thing about Jean was how consistently she was her stubborn, beleaguered, central self. People, particularly women, are so often modified by other people such as a spouse, a child, a parent, an interesting stranger, a boring old friend, becoming a little (or sometimes a lot) different according to their company. Jean was always Jean, as a cat is always a cat: a being with an an essence too strong to be altered by anything but its own emotions, such as fear or anger. Just as one gets positive pleasure from watching a wild creature being itself, so I always got pleasure from watching Jean being Jean.</p> <p>And, of course - this was by far the most important element in people's affection for Jean - the more one realised her frailties and inefficiencies, the more one marvelled at her steely strength as a writer.</p> <p>It is impossible to describe briefly the burdens inflicted on her by poverty, loneliness and the strain of living with a very ill man during the many years when she struggled with her greatest novel, Wide Sargasso Sea. It is no exaggeration to say that it nearly killed her: her heart went into failure on the day she was supposed to hand the book over to me, and it was two years before she recovered enough to add the two or three little finishing touches without which she would not let us publish it.

      "body": "<p>Ian Walker's 12-year career at Tottenham looks to be over after the former England goalkeeper had a written transfer request accepted yesterday. The 28-year-old asked for a move after losing his place to Neil Sullivan, who joined from Wimbledon during the summer. He has not played for the first team this season. </p> <p>\"We understand his frustration at his lack of first-team opportunities at the moment,\" said Tottenham's director of football, David Pleat. </p> <p>\"Ian's form last season was excellent and by bringing in Neil Sullivan, it increased the competition at the club. We now have two top-class goalkeepers and we are perhaps victims of that situation.\" </p> <p>Mark Bosnich, another out-of-favour goalkeeper, yesterday turned down a loan move from Manchester United to Middlesbrough. </p> <p>Bosnich was approached after Mark Schwarzer broke a thumb in a training accident and would have played at Manchester City today. </p> <p>But his manager Sir Alex Ferguson explained: \"He says he's not in a position to go. He doesn't feel right to go on loan at the moment.\" Boro, who will lose Schwarzer for about six weeks, have borrowed Gary Walsh from Bradford instead. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Ferguson is resigned to losing Jaap Stam for up to two months after doctors advised the Holland defender he needs an operation on a recurring achilles problem. Stam has been pencilled in to have surgery if and when United have completed the second group stage of the Champions League. </p> <p>\"It would be a good time to get it cleaned out in December,\" Ferguson said. \"That would probably mean Jaap being out for around seven weeks but it might be worth doing.\" </p> <p>Swindon's match at home to Cambridge today has been called off because of the fuel crisis, but the weekend's football is otherwise expected to go ahead as planned. </p> <p>Swindon postponed their game because they could not guarantee enough stewards would be available. The Premiership's sponsors Carling have laid on free coaches to help Newcastle, Derby and Ipswich fans reach their away matches. </p> <p>The Leeds striker Alan Smith has come in for more criticism from Barcelona.

      "bodyText": "Ian Walker's 12-year career at Tottenham looks to be over after the former England goalkeeper had a written transfer request accepted yesterday. The 28-year-old asked for a move after losing his place to Neil Sullivan, who joined from Wimbledon during the summer. He has not played for the first team this season. \"We understand his frustration at his lack of first-team opportunities at the moment,\" said Tottenham's director of football, David Pleat. \"Ian's form last season was excellent and by bringing in Neil Sullivan, it increased the competition at the club. We now have two top-class goalkeepers and we are perhaps victims of that situation.\" Mark Bosnich, another out-of-favour goalkeeper, yesterday turned down a loan move from Manchester United to Middlesbrough. Bosnich was approached after Mark Schwarzer broke a thumb in a training accident and would have played at Manchester City today. But his manager Sir Alex Ferguson explained: \"He says he's not in a position to go. He doesn't feel right to go on loan at the moment.\" Boro, who will lose Schwarzer for about six weeks, have borrowed Gary Walsh from Bradford instead. Meanwhile, Ferguson is resigned to losing Jaap Stam for up to two months after doctors advised the Holland defender he needs an operation on a recurring achilles problem. Stam has been pencilled in to have surgery if and when United have completed the second group stage of the Champions League. \"It would be a good time to get it cleaned out in December,\" Ferguson said. \"That would probably mean Jaap being out for around seven weeks but it might be worth doing.\" Swindon's match at home to Cambridge today has been called off because of the fuel crisis, but the weekend's football is otherwise expected to go ahead as planned. Swindon postponed their game because they could not guarantee enough stewards would be available. The Premiership's sponsors Carling have laid on free coaches to help Newcastle, Derby and Ipswich fans reach their away matches. The Leeds striker Alan Smith has come in for more criticism from Barcelona. Phillip Cocu claims Smith put him out for up to fortnight with a two-footed challenge. \"He looks at the opponent more than he does the ball,\" said Cocu, whose team-mate Frank de Boer described Smith as \"mean and nasty\". The Leeds captain Lucas Radebe has been ordered to rest by a neurologist after suffering headaches since he was concussed in Barcelona on Wednesday. He will miss today's game against Ipswich and almost certainly Tuesday's at home to Milan. Steve Walsh, 35, has joined Norwich from Leicester. The move reunites the defender with the Norwich manager Bryan Hamilton, who signed him for Leicester 14 years ago. Red Star Belgrade have appealed against the decision to move their Uefa Cup first-round, second-leg tie against Leicester to a neutral venue. Aston Villa's Luc Nilis is likely to have a fourth operation on his fractured leg in the next month. The former Wolves striker John Richards has severed his links with the club after resigning from the board.",

Not waiting for any introductions, he playfully bounds across the training- ground car park , pumps your hand and announces : \"So, I'm the Everton new boy.\" </p> <p>His astonishingly cultured performances for his side this season would appear to give the lie to his newness. So effortlessly has he adjusted to Premiership football that one would think he had been around as long as Gazza. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that he has spent many of his 24 years studying English football and dreaming of playing in it. </p> <p>He seemed ready to make the leap three years ago before leaving his home town Danish club Vejle for Hamburg.

I am hoping only that we are a top- 10 side this season and in three years' time that we might be pressing for a Champions League place.\" </p> <p>It did not take long for Gravesen to get used to one player's ways.

His accurate passing has also provided young Francis Jeffers with the openings to present a flurry of goals as his downpayment on a future England career. </p> <p>Far from acting like a mad dog, Gravesen has yet to see a yellow card waved in his face after four matches. And he has already become a favourite of fans who, reared on the holy trinity of Harvey, Ball and Kendall, are particularly fond of a creative midfield player. </p> <p>At present, Premiership life is beautiful for Gravesen, who is prepared to risk the scorn of his former colleagues in Germany when he says: \"This is the best league in the world.

It is, he says, the team's biggest game of the season. </p> <p>One would have thought he would have singled out next month's derby game at Liverpool for that.

      "bodyText": "Thomas Gravesen is clearly a self-confident young man. Either that or the two months of sharing a dressing room with Paul Gascoigne are already beginning to have an effect. Not waiting for any introductions, he playfully bounds across the training- ground car park , pumps your hand and announces : \"So, I'm the Everton new boy.\" His astonishingly cultured performances for his side this season would appear to give the lie to his newness. So effortlessly has he adjusted to Premiership football that one would think he had been around as long as Gazza. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that he has spent many of his 24 years studying English football and dreaming of playing in it. He seemed ready to make the leap three years ago before leaving his home town Danish club Vejle for Hamburg. But on catching a glimpse of himself in a full- length mirror he decided he was a bit too Kate Moss, a bit short of muscles and light of weight to compete. Since then he has added just over two stone and weighs in at a more model English footballing size of 13st 9lb. \"English football is much faster, stronger and more physical than in Germany, though just as good technically,\" the 24-year-old says. \"So I felt I needed to be stronger before coming here, though I still thought it would take me much longer to adjust.\" He started as a sweeper with Vejle but showed his midfield intelligence for Denmark against Holland and France in Euro 2000.

      "body": "<p>Claudio Ranieri, who was spotted in the stand making copious notes during Chelsea's Uefa Cup tie with St Gallen on Thursday, has been handed the task of writing a new chapter in the club's history. </p> <p>Chelsea moved swiftly to fill the managerial vacancy caused by Tuesday's sacking of Gianluca Vialli, replacing an Italian with an Italian. But there the similarity ends. </p> <p>The 48-year-old Ranieri, who has signed a three-year contract, will not be known as manager, but as head coach, an acknowledgement of his specific area of skills. It is hoped that he will bring a studious approach to the coaching art - more Wenger than Vialli. </p> <p>He has also taken on some big egos in the boardroom - and dressing-room - and won. It will be surprising if player-power features in his eventual departure. For wherever he has worked, Ranieri has earned huge respect. The only slight worry for the Chelsea purists is that he does have a reputation for playing something of a long-ball game. </p> <p>Chelsea first approached him on Monday, before Vialli was actually sacked. He was invited to Stamford Bridge and in two days of talks impressed the Chelsea hierarchy with his scholarly love of the game and convinced them of the heights they can reach under his leadership. </p> <p>A long list of the great and the good applied for the job, but all along Chelsea seemed to have eyes for only one man. \"If there are roses, they will bloom,\" he said before yesterday's talks. They did. </p> <p>After wrapping up the formalities yesterday, Ranieri is understood to have briefly returned to Italy before he flies back for Chelsea's game against Leicester tomorrow. He will be there as a spectator before formally taking up the reins on Monday. </p> <p>\"He will only be concentrating on the first-team squad, the coaching and the tactics,\" said Chelsea's managing director Colin Hutchinson. \"The administration will be solely handled at the training ground, as far as the team is concerned, by Gwyn Williams, who is termed assistant manager.\" Ranieri has been promised money to bring in his own players but may have to sell as well. </p> <p>Few people in Britain will have heard of the Italian. But in Spain and Italy, this snappy dresser is well known, and well respected. Various top clubs in each of those leagues have been eyeing him of late. </p> <p>Ranieri has never won a league title of the Champions League, which must be what Chelsea want him to do for them, but he has never had the resources or the time with which to do so. The Valencia team that reached this year's European Cup final was, however, based on that he left behind just over a year ago. </p> <p>Indeed it was his time at Valencia that first caught Hutchinson's eye. Two years ago they beat Barcelona three times in a week and he was impressed. </p> <p>\"I watched all three games on TV. Two were in the cup and one in the league. I kept thinking that Louis van Gaal would come up with something different against Valencia but Claudio Ranieri got the better of him on each occasion. </p> <p>\"I spent three hours with him before the Uefa Cup game against St Gallen, talking about football. I wanted to know about his philosophy on the game and his ideas.\" </p> <p>Once again Ranieri impressed. And another advantage is that most of Chelsea's continental players know him. Gianfranco Zola actually played under him at Napoli and no doubt offered a fine testimonial. Ranieri brought Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to Atletico Madrid last season, where the Dutchman scored 24 goals in a side that was relegated. </p> <p>Almost everywhere Ranieri has reigned, he has brought success. As a moderate midfielder he was briefly on Roma's books before winning promotion with Catanzaro, Catania and Palermo. As coach he took Cagliari from Serie C to Serie A is successive seasons. He then briefly joined Napoli, taking over Fiorentina in 1993. There he won promotion to Serie A, plus the Italian Cup and domestic Super Cup. He also managed to survive four years under the outspoken chairman Vittorio Cecchi Gori. </p> <p>From there to Valencia, where he started with a few problems. Ranieri's dislike of prima donnas immediately put him in conflict with the Argentine international Ariel Ortega, who would saunter back from international call-ups at his own pace. Ranieri's response was short and sharp, and Ortega soon fell into line. </p> <p>Then there was Romario. When Ranieri made known his views on the Brazilian striker's habit of disco-dancing until 4am two days before a match, Romario told him to mind his own business. </p> <p>\"In my private life I do what I like,\" he said the disco king, \"and whoever doesn't like it can get stuffed. If I don't go out, I don't score.\" Ranieri's response was immediate. He sold Romario back to Brazil. </p> <p>In his second season, Ranieri took Valencia to fourth and a Champions League place, and won the Spanish Cup. But soon he was tempted by Atletico. That move fell apart when the unpredictable owner Jesus Gill went to jail. He wanted Ranieri to stay but the receivers said no. </p> <p>So Ranieri found himself out of a job. Until Chelsea called. He is an intellectual thinker about coaching and tactics - he often plays 4-4-2 but is not rigid - as well as the treatment of players. He knows who needs the carrot and who the stick. </p> <p>He will make his first tactical task sorting out the defence. He will also instil a high work ethic on the pitch. At Fiorentina he angered the fans by regularly dropping Rui Costa, whom he deemed a luxury. Chelsea said when they sacked Vialli that they needed a change of direction.
