      "body": "<p>The French ambassador in London, His Excellency Daniel Bernard, owns a Chelsea shirt with the name and number 'Bernard 99' on the back. It was a gift last year from one of his friends from Stamford Bridge, Frank Leboeuf, and he is fond of it, although he is far too tactful to claim any bias to Chelsea, being obliged to follow the fortunes of the ever-increasing legion of Frenchmen making waves all over Britain. These days, with enough French players here to form two complete teams plus subs, there is a lot for him to watch over. </p> <p>Bernard makes it his business to forge close contacts with the men who, to English eyes, represent France in a way that he never could. He calls footballers, with their huge star status and profile, the new ambassadors. He remembers how Betty Boothroyd, receiving President Chirac at the House of Commons, expressed how glad she was to meet the second most famous Frenchman in Britain. And who, he responded, was the first? </p> <p>Eric Cantona. </p> <p>Bernard is still amazed by the fact this enigma of a player managed to inspire thousands of Englishmen at Old Trafford to sing La Marseillaise. Cantona is a key figure in trying to unravel the contradictory attitude the English have towards French footballers, who are at once adored and admired, hounded and harangued. </p> <p>'There are mixed feelings towards the French,' agrees Bernard. 'On the one hand people are attracted by the exotic and the Mediterranean style of football, which has brought something spectacular to English football. On the other they are a bit annoyed that the Nordic tradition has not yet found the solution to overcome it. </p> <p>'I appreciate also that young English players might have their progress stopped by the presence of imported stars - although it must be said it is not only the French who come here - and there may be some resentment against that. In the long run it might not be good for English football. </p> <p>'The fact French footballers are successful here makes them admired and liked but also triggers jealousy. That is a human reaction. It is not helped by the tabloid newspapers, who take a particular delight in adapting the clich\u00e9s and preconceived ideas they have of France. Either they are musketeers or they are scoundrels. </p> <p>'Where does it come from? The first one was Cantona, who had a very contrasting image - the God and the villain - but he was an outstanding player. Cantona showed to the football society here that there are other ways of playing football. Then came Ginola, who was not only a quality player but also a sexy star who could attract the attention of the ladies. Then a whole series of French players came. I can only rejoice to see so many French players in England because most of them give a really positive image of France. I am in contact with most of them because they have so much weight on public opinion. Besides,' he adds, 'they are very nice guys.' </p> <p>He is proud to note that it is not just the major attractions who are working here; other professionals are making also an impression, like West Ham's Marc Keller and the Newcastle pair Didier Domi and Alain Goma. Although uprooting to make a living and a life in a foreign country is always challenging, with culture clashes to overcome, he says that all the players he has spoken to are welcomed with kindness in their English neighbourhoods. 'Although some, when they are on the pitch, don't receive the same welcome as others,' he adds. </p> <p>As a football aficionado (his attache's attempts to feed him some information before this interview were rejected as unnecessary) Bernard understands that the topic of the moment is Patrick Vieira. He reels off statistics comparing his saintly disciplinary record for France compared to the Premiership. </p> <p>'I saw the game and the red cards,' he says. 'First of all football has become such an enormous business that people must be very careful it remains a game within strict limits of courtesy or fair play. Referees, and their decisions, must be respected. Secondly Vieira is a very nice guy. I know him well. He is awfully talented, charming, strong like an ox, and in a position where he has to do a difficult job. A midfielder does not win the ball with only caresses. Paul Ince and Roy Keane are not angels either, they do not do it with flowers. Three, he is a hot-tempered guy and he must work on his tendency to boil up like this. Four, one wonders if, having acquired this image, he is not a target of some provocation by other players or particular care by referees.' </p> <p>Perhaps, I venture, the ambassador could help by teaching Vieira some diplomatic skills.

But when it comes to managers publicly backing members of their teams who are sent off, Wenger is seen as being among those at the top of the list. </p> <p>The subject has again been brought into sharp focus by the recent complaints by Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf that his manager, Gianluca Vialli, did not defend him over his red card for stamping on Harry Kewell in last season's match against Leeds. </p> <p>For me, Leboeuf's attitude was strange to say the least. I cannot see how any manager could have defended him for that without making himself look a fool. </p> <p>It has been the same story with me concerning the Coventry players who have recently been sent off. David Burrows, John Aloisi and David Thompson all deserved to be shown the red card; and it is refreshing to me that all have been honest enough with themselves to acknowledge it. </p> <p>David was sent off twice last season for catching an opponent in the face with his hand. He had run the risk of that happening for some time because he had picked up the Paul Gascoigne habit of throwing his arms out to hold off an opponent when running with the ball. We kept saying to him: 'Keep your arms down - if you don't you'll run into problems with referees.' </p> <p>When it happened, I did not have a go at David publicly. But nor did I say: 'Oh, he was unlucky - the other player's face got in the way of his fist.' </p> <p>In some ways, though, the present so-called 'red rage' nature of Premiership matches does give a slightly misleading picture. </p> <p>While I have seen some dodgy challenges, I would say that this aspect of the English game is nothing like as bad as it was in the Sixties and Seventies. And in terms of blatant physical intimidation, the players most likely to be on the receiving end, the ones known to have a short fuse, get more protection than ever from referees. </p> <p>One change - and it is something I have been reminded of through the view that Vieira is deliberately provoked by opponents - is that teams can no longer get away with using a 'rota' system to commit early fouls on such players. </p> <p>At one time, a defender was rarely booked for his first foul on a player and it was not unusual for that player to be clogged by three different men without the referee taking action against any of them. </p> <p>My own experience of how it worked came in a match for Aberdeen against Airdrie, when someone kicked me on the ankle in the first 10 minutes, inflicting a wound that needed six stitches. The offender immediately looked at the referee and reminded him: 'First one, ref.' </p> <p>'OK then,' the official replied. 'But don't do it again.' If that had happened today, the player would have been booked straight away. </p> <p>I also have to make the point, however, that intimidatory tactics - provided they are within the laws - are an important part of the game. I have lost count of the number of players who tried to provoke me into doing something rash during my career, and was not averse to indulging in this myself. </p> <p>You have to exploit opposition weaknesses - and if one of those weaknesses concerns a player not being able to control his emotions, I see nothing wrong with the general principle of trying to exploit it. </p> <p>I must also point out that it is inevitable that there should be highly-charged physical confrontations at this stage of the season, when the adrenalin levels of the players are probably at their highest. All teams like to think they give 100 per cent commitment throughout the season, but it seems to me that immediately after the recharging of batteries in the summer, there is always a danger of that commitment being allowed to run out of control in the opening weeks. </p> <p>At Coventry experienced the problems of this high-octane factor in last Saturday's home defeat by Middlesbrough.

We want you to show it by running faster and jumping higher.

      "trailText": "<p>Supporters of Inter Milan are in a state of shock following their Champions League defeat to Helsingborg, but the club's problem lies right at the top: il presidente.</p>",
      "byline": "Simon Kuper",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When the Inter Milan party arrived in the port of Helsingborg earlier this month, they were surprised to discover they were in Sweden. They had thought Helsingborg was in Denmark. Perhaps confused by this, they lost the match, a Champions League qualifier, by 1-0. In the return in the San Siro on Wednesday, the Swedes kept Inter scoreless for 89 minutes. Then, inevitably, Inter were given a penalty. This, everyone understood, would take them into the Champions League. </p> <p>'Will you take it?' Luigi di Biagio asked his Uruguayan team-mate Alvaro Recoba. Recoba did. But a Swedish keeper with the evocative name of Sven Andersson saved his shot. The match ended 0-0, and Helsingborg are in the Champions League. </p> <p>The Italians, who in August turn into a sort of one-family holiday, are treating the result as a shock. In fact, there was nothing more logical than that Inter should lose to Helsingborg. Inter regularly lose to Swedish teams, and have long since ceased to be a big club. In 20 years they have won just one Italian title, and in the history of the Champions League they have qualified only once. </p> <p>This is despite spending probably more money than any other club in the world in recent years. Inter exist to give hope to the little man. The problem is their president, Massimo Moratti. The Italian club president is a phenomenon without a British equivalent: typically, a grey-haired figure in a long blue coat with an entourage of thousands who funds, rules, and virtually is his club. Men like Gianni Agnelli of Juventus, Milan's Silvio Berlusconi and Lazio's Sergio Cragnotti are fawned upon as the Queen Mother is here. </p> <p>Players regularly pledge to regain form or win a game for 'il presidente'. Ronaldo, Inter's injured striker, says: 'I will remain with Moratti forever.' Nwankwo Kanu, who barely played in his time at Inter, still calls Moratti 'my Italian father'. Javier Zanetti says Moratti is 'a great gentleman' to whom he, Zanetti, owes everything. Yet Moratti has achieved almost nothing. </p> <p>He was born to be president of Inter. The son of Angelo Moratti, who ran the club from 1955 to 1968, Massimo grew up watching the great Inter side that with judicious bribes to referees won two European Cups. Later Massimo inherited the family oil business, Saras, and in 1995 bought his Dad's old club for only \u00a320 million. That's when the trouble began. </p> <p>Moratti's acolytes say he buys like a fan. Rather, he buys like a Japanese teenager in a clothes shop on Milan's Via Spiga, grabbing everything with a brand name. He has signed Ronaldo, Kanu, Roberto Baggio, Christian Vieri, Clarence Seedorf, Hakan Sukur, Robbie Keane and countless others. If you have lost track of a footballer, the likelihood is that he has been forgotten in a dusty office drawer at Inter. This week's purchase was the Brazilian Vampeta, his arrival no doubt connected with two much-televised goals he scored recently against Argentina. Moratti says: 'You can never have enough skilful players.' By one estimate, he has spent almost \u00a3300 million on Inter. </p> <p>He has, admittedly, had rotten luck. Ronaldo's knees and Kanu's heart suddenly revealed flaws, while even the massive Vieri, once an Australian fast bowler, got injured. Ronaldo expects to spend the autumn in Beverton, Oregon and is at least a year away from a return. </p> <p>But Moratti deserves his misfortune. He has a particular penchant for big-name players whom other clubs won't touch, like Seedorf and Sukur. </p> <p>Moreover, he unsettles his players by buying new ones for the same position days later, or by revealing during the season who will be released at the end. He has gone through eight managers in five years, with another tipped to replace Lippi before the Italian season starts on 1 October. </p> <p>At Juventus, the Agnellis let their coach make the decisions. Moratti hires Lippi, Italy's most respected coach, lauds him as 'a man of character, a Tuscan', and then proceeds to buy cartloads of players and state publicly where they should play.

      "bodyText": "When the Inter Milan party arrived in the port of Helsingborg earlier this month, they were surprised to discover they were in Sweden. They had thought Helsingborg was in Denmark. Perhaps confused by this, they lost the match, a Champions League qualifier, by 1-0. In the return in the San Siro on Wednesday, the Swedes kept Inter scoreless for 89 minutes. Then, inevitably, Inter were given a penalty. This, everyone understood, would take them into the Champions League. 'Will you take it?' Luigi di Biagio asked his Uruguayan team-mate Alvaro Recoba. Recoba did. But a Swedish keeper with the evocative name of Sven Andersson saved his shot. The match ended 0-0, and Helsingborg are in the Champions League. The Italians, who in August turn into a sort of one-family holiday, are treating the result as a shock. In fact, there was nothing more logical than that Inter should lose to Helsingborg. Inter regularly lose to Swedish teams, and have long since ceased to be a big club. In 20 years they have won just one Italian title, and in the history of the Champions League they have qualified only once. This is despite spending probably more money than any other club in the world in recent years. Inter exist to give hope to the little man. The problem is their president, Massimo Moratti. The Italian club president is a phenomenon without a British equivalent: typically, a grey-haired figure in a long blue coat with an entourage of thousands who funds, rules, and virtually is his club. Men like Gianni Agnelli of Juventus, Milan's Silvio Berlusconi and Lazio's Sergio Cragnotti are fawned upon as the Queen Mother is here. Players regularly pledge to regain form or win a game for 'il presidente'. Ronaldo, Inter's injured striker, says: 'I will remain with Moratti forever.' Nwankwo Kanu, who barely played in his time at Inter, still calls Moratti 'my Italian father'. Javier Zanetti says Moratti is 'a great gentleman' to whom he, Zanetti, owes everything. Yet Moratti has achieved almost nothing. He was born to be president of Inter. The son of Angelo Moratti, who ran the club from 1955 to 1968, Massimo grew up watching the great Inter side that with judicious bribes to referees won two European Cups. Later Massimo inherited the family oil business, Saras, and in 1995 bought his Dad's old club for only \u00a320 million. That's when the trouble began. Moratti's acolytes say he buys like a fan. Rather, he buys like a Japanese teenager in a clothes shop on Milan's Via Spiga, grabbing everything with a brand name. He has signed Ronaldo, Kanu, Roberto Baggio, Christian Vieri, Clarence Seedorf, Hakan Sukur, Robbie Keane and countless others. If you have lost track of a footballer, the likelihood is that he has been forgotten in a dusty office drawer at Inter. This week's purchase was the Brazilian Vampeta, his arrival no doubt connected with two much-televised goals he scored recently against Argentina. Moratti says: 'You can never have enough skilful players.' By one estimate, he has spent almost \u00a3300 million on Inter. He has, admittedly, had rotten luck. Ronaldo's knees and Kanu's heart suddenly revealed flaws, while even the massive Vieri, once an Australian fast bowler, got injured. Ronaldo expects to spend the autumn in Beverton, Oregon and is at least a year away from a return. But Moratti deserves his misfortune. He has a particular penchant for big-name players whom other clubs won't touch, like Seedorf and Sukur. Moreover, he unsettles his players by buying new ones for the same position days later, or by revealing during the season who will be released at the end. He has gone through eight managers in five years, with another tipped to replace Lippi before the Italian season starts on 1 October. At Juventus, the Agnellis let their coach make the decisions. Moratti hires Lippi, Italy's most respected coach, lauds him as 'a man of character, a Tuscan', and then proceeds to buy cartloads of players and state publicly where they should play. So Seedorf arrived from Real Madrid in January, was apparently offered for sale last week, and was this week voted, by thousands of diehard Inter fans in a poll on the club website, best player of the Helsingborg match. Inter, apparently, have yet to pay his transfer fee. Other presidents - Berlusconi at Inter and Cragnotti at Lazio - interfere with transfers too. But they have had a happier touch, which suggests that given enough money even the average fan can buy a winning team. It's really not that difficult. On Wednesday a Swedish journalist asked Lippi whether the defeat was a catastrophe for Inter. 'You are a Swede?' Lippi replied. 'Well, then think of the good things for your team, and not the bad things for ours. These are our matters, and I don't see how they could interest you.' What, indeed, of Helsingborg? Their victory has tickled the Swedish sense of humour. 'Hilarious,' says a club official, who recounts that when the team returned home from Milan at 5am on Thursday, two fans had turned out to greet them. Neither one was from Helsingborg itself, but the players were chuffed none the less. They are struggling in the Swedish league, so it was nice to beat Inter.",

Eighteen months of non-improvement later, the now-beleaguered Keegan travels to Paris on Saturday more fearful of symmetry than of the world and European champions. </p> <p>The feeling is growing that a bad result at the Stade de France could see the end of Keegan's reign. Of course it would make no sense to change the manager with only a month until important World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Finland, but that might not stop the newly ruthless FA seizing the opportunity presented by another lacklustre display to call a halt to Keegan's unequal struggle. </p> <p>Better to act decisively, for better or worse, the argument goes, than to jeopardise World Cup qualification through misplaced loyalty. Better in that case to have acted straight after England's miserable Euro 2000, as did several more successful nations, but perhaps that would have come too close to admitting they made a mistake in the first place. </p> <p>Certainly Keegan himself appears to have seen through the public votes of confidence and the supposedly solid support for him from Geoff Thompson downwards. 'I've had tremendous support from inside the FA, from Adam Crozier, David Davies and everybody, but that is not going to keep me in the job,' he said. 'The only thing that will keep me England manager to the end of my contract is results.' </p> <p>At his press conference to announce his wholly unsurprising squad for France, Keegan was tense to an extent not seen since his final days at Newcastle. Gone was any pretence of enjoying the job or looking forward to the next challenge. In between sniping at individual journalists for a variety of misdemeanours including coughing, expressing pessimism and suggesting he had fallen out with Andy Cole, Keegan grimly stated he had no intention of resigning and would have to be sacked. He also claimed that although England failed at Euro 2000, the German failure was greater, and suggested the media were responsible for making the situation look graver than it actually is. </p> <p>Keegan then casually announced that the 38-year-old Stuart Pearce would come straight back into contention as soon as he was match fit, so you must make up your own minds on the gravity of the situation. </p> <p>It was not a media invention either when Keegan suggested Italy (three wins out of three in the group stage and within seconds of winning the final) had been slightly lucky to avoid England. 'Italy weren't playing that much better than us but they got through, that's the difference,' he said. 'We were only two minutes away from getting through to a quarter-final against Italy.' </p> <p>Glenn Hoddle was fond of this sort of revisionism, though at least his side went out of the last World Cup playing well. Keegan accepts his side played badly, though appears to resent anyone saying so. 'I don't think the press should be allowed to take away the confidence of the national side all the time,' he said. </p> <p>One could be facetious here, and observe that one or two England defenders are capable of doing that all by themselves, but it is probably best not to argue the point. 'The criticism we received at Euro 2000 was justified,' Keegan said. 'But I don't accept criticism from journalists who have never played the game. If Gary Lineker wants to have a go at Alan Shearer, well at least he's played in big games and he knows what goes on. I'll accept it more from professional pundits. I won't accept it from journalists who don't know what the game is all about, who sit up in the stand and see the game totally differently.' </p> <p>Fair enough. Keegan is not the first football manager to feel that way and he won't be the last. But someone should have a quiet word with him to the effect that journalists aren't the only people who sit and watch and see things differently from the way managers see them. The vast majority of football spectators, whether on the terraces or at home on the sofa, have never played at international level. The journalists are merely the ones with a platform to air their opinions. </p> <p>And if Keegan is going to be so dismissive of journalists' opinions, it is odd that he sets so much store by those of the general public. 'People in the street have been very supportive,' he said. 'The only pessimism around is among you people. The people I meet are right behind us, they wish me good luck and believe we can win.' </p> <p>This street of Keegan's must contain the petrol station Hoddle used to pop into for fill-ups of confidence, for he always used to report the same sort of reaction. It is comforting to know that old-fashioned English politeness is still alive and well, though Keegan would be well-advised to think less of his personal popularity factor and concentrate on his team. As he says, if you get it right on the football pitch the press can't really hurt you. </p> <p>To that end, Keegan has been considering playing David Beckham in central midfield (though he is more likely to stick with Paul Scholes) and switching to a back three, though all bets on England's new formation are off until the damage from this weekend's Premiership fixtures has been surveyed. </p> <p>Darren Anderton could be on the right or left wing, ditto Nick Barmby, and Keegan would like to start with Steven Gerrard in midfield. Keegan has admitted that Cole is now at his peak, so if he doesn't play there will be trouble. None of these is exactly a new face, but post-Shearer, post-Euro 2000, all have a chance to make a fresh start. </p> <p>'It's more or less the same squad, but there are a lot of options within it,' Keegan said. 'I probably feel the same way as Sir Alex Ferguson about bringing David Beckham inside, I just wish there were two of him so that we could still have the service from the right, but I don't feel the time is right yet to make wholesale changes. </p> <p>'Everybody is talking about the new Germany, but in fact their squad against Spain contained 16 from Euro 2000. You just try to put right what went wrong, without disrupting the whole squad. </p> <p>'People accuse me of not bringing any youngsters in, but they are in already. I took six players out of the under 21s [Barry, Dyer, Ferdinand, Gerrard, Heskey and Owen] and that's probably why Howard's team didn't do better in their competition. The next generation is already growing up with England, and they can only be better for the experience.'</p>",

Then on Friday, we get the public to vote on which ref should be kicked out of the Premiership. The 0898 revenue would be huge. Hell, one day we could even make it pay-per-voyeur. Could go out just before the 10 o'clock news, to get the crossover ratings. </p> <p>'What do you mean it sounds like Big Brother, Greg? This would be public service broadcasting, for Chrissakes.' </p> <p>Dontcha just love football these days in all its mad, knockabout guises, with 90 minutes of action (no, he's holding up 15 minutes of stoppage time) lasting a week? </p> <p>Consistency is what we need, say the managers. So after a summer at Euro 2000 of lauding referees for common sense with cards - including the beleaguered Graham Poll, arbiter of the Arsenal v Liverpool red-rage match - Sir Alex Ferguson bemoans that yellow cards were not shown sooner in the Charity Shield. So it was Mike Riley's fault that Roy Keane stabbed his studs into Gustavo Poyet's calf, was it? </p> <p>Then we have John Barnwell of the League Managers' Association praising Arsene Wenger and Gerard Houllier for their restraint and dignity in their response to Mr Poll - valid in this observer's opinion; after all we supposedly live in a freedom-of-speech country. What, though, has Mr Barnwell had to say after watching the Derby manager Jim Smith jab his finger into Dermot Gallagher's chest in midweek? </p> <p>That kind of action is so much more damaging. In my experience, kids do not by and large ape the worst of professional players, except in some annoying celebrations of goals. But their misguided coaches do often think they are some kind of flash, brash Ron Knee figure. As with professionals, kids are set the wrong examples by managers who enable them to behave badly. Who fines managers two weeks' wages? </p> <p>You want more consistency? Andy Gray on Sky is criticised by the England manager Kevin Keegan - a well-paid TV pundit himself, but not half so brave - for his analysis of red-card issues. This from a representative of the FA, who happily take the riches on offer from the game's favoured broadcaster. </p> <p>The good thing about the last week is that it has raised many issues that need resolving about an English game ill at ease with itself, its self-image having slumped in the summer, and now bent on muscularly reasserting itself. </p> <p>This quarter has always supported referees in their demanding role. They do not commit fouls after all; they are actually trying to encourage the ball-players and limit the amount of injuries which deny moaning managers the services of, and fans the pleasure of watching, the most skilful. </p> <p>The time has come, however, to give referees some help. There has been some sound sense amid the hysteria this week. Glenn Hoddle suggests a third card and this column has argued before that a 'white card' for technical, non-violent offences such as shaping up to retaliate but being stopped, as happened to Patrick Vieira against Liverpool, would defuse much. </p> <p>Since that match, Graham Poll has rescinded Dietmar Hamann's second yellow for some minor jostling (though he deserved a red for his 'challenge' before Vieira's dismissal) but Liverpool, then pressing for an equaliser, were reduced to nine men and conceded a second goal. How important will that be at the end of the season? A white card would have averted the injustice. </p> <p>Then there is Arsene Wenger's belief in the two-referee system, also previously aired here. The game is simply too quick for one referee these days, especially at the start of a season. Privately, the Arsenal players were shocked by the fitness and condition of Steve Dunn at Sunderland eight days ago. If refs pass all the tests, players say, then the tests are not strict enough. </p> <p>But they have assistants these days as well as fourth officials, say the authorities. Really? On the opening day at Nottingham Forest, a linesman - for that is what they really remain - gave the referee no help (ref struggling to keep up, lino in line), abdicating responsibility for the decision in a clear penalty for West Bromwich Albion. And where was the linesman last Monday when the corner that wasn't led to Arsenal's first goal? </p> <p>These days, too, linesmen still struggle in level offside decisions, understandably given the cuteness of the timing of runs by the best strikers. Technology must come. Forget all the niggling caveats about stopping the game - it would actually increase the drama. Find ways of getting round the little problems to solve the big one. </p> <p>Then fourth officials? I suppose someone has to hold up those boards for those 15 minutes of stoppage-time fame or report Arsene Wenger for the sort of tunnel dispute that used to take care of itself. </p> <p>Professional referees must also come. The best will say that they don't know how much more professional they could be in their own training regimes but it would, at the least, earn them more respect from players, who, rightly or wrongly, see their week's work being undermined by a council clerk from Barnsley (er, sorry; the FA don't want referee's home towns to be listed any more, for security purposes). </p> <p>This season, the FA have laudably agreed to the moving of the ball forward 10 yards if defenders do not immediately retreat. They have considerable influence on Fifa's International Board, which dictates the rules. They are well placed, given the problems of their domestic game, to extend the offer of experimentation further. </p> <p>And there are smaller, shorter-term measures that might help. The PFA could, for instance, start making a Sportsman of the Year award in each division. If they won't, the Football Writers' Association certainly should, having lost sight of what our award is about in giving it to Roy Keane last season. </p> <p>In the meantime, it would help if everybody relaxed a little and took responsibility for their own behaviour. Stoked by fortnight-long promotional tapes (using Dennis Wise, for goodness sake), fans champ at the bit, players emerge from fell running and meaningless friendlies like uncaged tigers. Weariness, and perspective, should creep in soon. </p> <p>Remember, as they sing on a Friday night in the Big Brother household, that other tool to enliven the media dog days of August: it's only a game show.</p>",

So it was Mike Riley's fault that Roy Keane stabbed his studs into Gustavo Poyet's calf, was it? Then we have John Barnwell of the League Managers' Association praising Arsene Wenger and Gerard Houllier for their restraint and dignity in their response to Mr Poll - valid in this observer's opinion; after all we supposedly live in a freedom-of-speech country. What, though, has Mr Barnwell had to say after watching the Derby manager Jim Smith jab his finger into Dermot Gallagher's chest in midweek? That kind of action is so much more damaging. In my experience, kids do not by and large ape the worst of professional players, except in some annoying celebrations of goals. But their misguided coaches do often think they are some kind of flash, brash Ron Knee figure. As with professionals, kids are set the wrong examples by managers who enable them to behave badly. Who fines managers two weeks' wages? You want more consistency? Andy Gray on Sky is criticised by the England manager Kevin Keegan - a well-paid TV pundit himself, but not half so brave - for his analysis of red-card issues. This from a representative of the FA, who happily take the riches on offer from the game's favoured broadcaster. The good thing about the last week is that it has raised many issues that need resolving about an English game ill at ease with itself, its self-image having slumped in the summer, and now bent on muscularly reasserting itself. This quarter has always supported referees in their demanding role. They do not commit fouls after all; they are actually trying to encourage the ball-players and limit the amount of injuries which deny moaning managers the services of, and fans the pleasure of watching, the most skilful. The time has come, however, to give referees some help. There has been some sound sense amid the hysteria this week. Glenn Hoddle suggests a third card and this column has argued before that a 'white card' for technical, non-violent offences such as shaping up to retaliate but being stopped, as happened to Patrick Vieira against Liverpool, would defuse much. Since that match, Graham Poll has rescinded Dietmar Hamann's second yellow for some minor jostling (though he deserved a red for his 'challenge' before Vieira's dismissal) but Liverpool, then pressing for an equaliser, were reduced to nine men and conceded a second goal. How important will that be at the end of the season? A white card would have averted the injustice. Then there is Arsene Wenger's belief in the two-referee system, also previously aired here. The game is simply too quick for one referee these days, especially at the start of a season. Privately, the Arsenal players were shocked by the fitness and condition of Steve Dunn at Sunderland eight days ago. If refs pass all the tests, players say, then the tests are not strict enough. But they have assistants these days as well as fourth officials, say the authorities. Really? On the opening day at Nottingham Forest, a linesman - for that is what they really remain - gave the referee no help (ref struggling to keep up, lino in line), abdicating responsibility for the decision in a clear penalty for West Bromwich Albion. And where was the linesman last Monday when the corner that wasn't led to Arsenal's first goal? These days, too, linesmen still struggle in level offside decisions, understandably given the cuteness of the timing of runs by the best strikers. Technology must come. Forget all the niggling caveats about stopping the game - it would actually increase the drama. Find ways of getting round the little problems to solve the big one. Then fourth officials? I suppose someone has to hold up those boards for those 15 minutes of stoppage-time fame or report Arsene Wenger for the sort of tunnel dispute that used to take care of itself. Professional referees must also come. The best will say that they don't know how much more professional they could be in their own training regimes but it would, at the least, earn them more respect from players, who, rightly or wrongly, see their week's work being undermined by a council clerk from Barnsley (er, sorry; the FA don't want referee's home towns to be listed any more, for security purposes). This season, the FA have laudably agreed to the moving of the ball forward 10 yards if defenders do not immediately retreat. They have considerable influence on Fifa's International Board, which dictates the rules. They are well placed, given the problems of their domestic game, to extend the offer of experimentation further. And there are smaller, shorter-term measures that might help. The PFA could, for instance, start making a Sportsman of the Year award in each division. If they won't, the Football Writers' Association certainly should, having lost sight of what our award is about in giving it to Roy Keane last season. In the meantime, it would help if everybody relaxed a little and took responsibility for their own behaviour. Stoked by fortnight-long promotional tapes (using Dennis Wise, for goodness sake), fans champ at the bit, players emerge from fell running and meaningless friendlies like uncaged tigers. Weariness, and perspective, should creep in soon. Remember, as they sing on a Friday night in the Big Brother household, that other tool to enliven the media dog days of August: it's only a game show.",

      "body": "<p>The Swedes are set to mount a hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange to scupper its merger with Germany's Deutsche B\u00f6rse. </p> <p>The decision to go hostile follows a bizarre day of drama last Friday when the LSE board rejected a surprise \u00a3800 million offer from OM Gruppen, the operator of Stockholm's trading floor. </p> <p>This weekend, OM and its City merchant bank advisers, Lazards, are huddled in urgent meetings, planning to go over the board's head and take the offer direct to LSE shareholders. The Swedish strike comes as LSE shareholders prepare to vote next month on its controversial plans to merge with the Frankfurt exchange to form international exchanges to be known as iX - the biggest pan-European stock market. </p> <p>'The reaction of the LSE board is wholly predictable,' OM Gruppen chief executive Per Larsson said. 'We are determined that the London market should have a better alternative to the flawed iX proposals.' </p> <p>The German merger plans have become increasingly controversial since they were announced last May. Since then, LSE has demutualised and its members are now free to sell their shares. Among brokers' concerns are the difficulty of harmonising regulation of the two exchanges, the costs of new trading systems and being overtaken in an effective sellout to Frankfurt. </p> <p>Opponents of the deal, however, are unlikely to back the Swedes' bid because it is mostly in paper.

      "bodyText": "The Swedes are set to mount a hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange to scupper its merger with Germany's Deutsche B\u00f6rse. The decision to go hostile follows a bizarre day of drama last Friday when the LSE board rejected a surprise \u00a3800 million offer from OM Gruppen, the operator of Stockholm's trading floor. This weekend, OM and its City merchant bank advisers, Lazards, are huddled in urgent meetings, planning to go over the board's head and take the offer direct to LSE shareholders. The Swedish strike comes as LSE shareholders prepare to vote next month on its controversial plans to merge with the Frankfurt exchange to form international exchanges to be known as iX - the biggest pan-European stock market. 'The reaction of the LSE board is wholly predictable,' OM Gruppen chief executive Per Larsson said. 'We are determined that the London market should have a better alternative to the flawed iX proposals.' The German merger plans have become increasingly controversial since they were announced last May. Since then, LSE has demutualised and its members are now free to sell their shares. Among brokers' concerns are the difficulty of harmonising regulation of the two exchanges, the costs of new trading systems and being overtaken in an effective sellout to Frankfurt. Opponents of the deal, however, are unlikely to back the Swedes' bid because it is mostly in paper. It offers \u00a320 in OM Gruppen shares plus \u00a37 cash against the \u00a323.50 market price of an LSE share on Friday. 'This is a purely opportunistic approach,' Martin Wheatley, LSE's director of business development told The Observer . 'On pure business grounds it does not fly. We came away with the clear conclusion that there was nothing we could support. There is nothing in it of any substance at all.'

A full-time novelist, she is one of a growing number of people who work from home. Left to their own devices, they usually create a different working environment to the one they left behind in the office. </p> <p>But their styles are completely individual. Ruth, a crime writer, worked at the other end of the day when she began writing. 'I found myself getting up at noon and working through to 4am. I had to be able to cut the world out. It just gravitated that way,' she explained. </p> <p>And Val McDermid, best-selling author of Killing the Shadows and other gory crime novels, starts at her desk about 9am, but needs to play computer games and find other distractions before the creative juices start flowing a couple of hours later. </p> <p>All three women graduated to writing from more conventional careers - Perriam in advertising, Ruth in teaching and McDermid in journalism. But even though all of them are immensely productive - averaging 14 books each - they would not be welcome in the traditional office. </p> <p>Perriam would have to be locked in a cupboard because of her breach of the dress code; Ruth would be accused of skiving because she arrived late; and McDermid would be quickly fired for misusing company equipment and not devoting all her time to her work. </p> <p>But things are going to change. Business is realising that most workers are more productive when they have some control over their own conditions. And there is also a clear link between a relaxed environment and creativity. The call of 'Eureka' came from the bath, not the desk. Coleridge dreamt the lines of Kubla Khan while asleep. And Charles Dickens did much of his writing in the family drawing room as he chatted to friends and played with his children. </p> <p>New businesses are not only recognising the connection between relaxation and creativity, but they are also finding the confidence to trust their employees and relax the old-fashioned rules. Sir Richard Branson is a frontrunner. The casual dress is not just a statement about being modern, it is also about being closer to the creative process. </p> <p>Margaret Briffa, an intellectual property lawyer, swept away decades of convention when she started Briffa &amp; Co in London's Islington five years ago. Unlike traditional lawyers who tend to reduce eye contact in their office seating plans, Briffa's team of eight have arranged their desks in a circle. 'We can discuss things as they come along,' she says. 'This is very good for helping our reaction times. Having to see your boss by going through a door is a barrier.' </p> <p>One of her lawyers is an afternoon and evening person and prefers to start work at lunchtime. She did have reservations about this at first, but now says: 'So long as people do the work, I'm not fussed. And we also have a lot of US business - so it's helpful that he stays later.' </p> <p>The most dramatic thing she did was to encourage her lawyers to bill clients for four hours a day - rather than the six or seven which is almost uniform throughout the rest of the profession. This means that the firm's income is possibly only two-thirds of what it might have been. But Briffa is not so sure about that: 'If you are time-pressured, you cannot take a step back. Taking the stress off ourselves makes us better lawyers. Also, it leads to our getting better business. Our clients tell us things they wouldn't have if they thought they were being charged for the conversation.' </p> <p>Frank Eve, a director of internet mortgage company E-loan, has been able to import some of the flexibility he had when he worked alone to the company's 50-strong team in Redhill. 'There is no monitoring of the hours people do here. If someone wanted to go at 3pm, there would be no checking. But we have found that people have actually been working longer hours here.' In fact, the directors have become anxious about the possibility of some staff working too hard - and they sometimes try to set an example by leaving early. </p> <p>Before joining E-loan, Eve was running a business called Flexemortgage from his home. 'I worked very different hours, depending on what was going on and also on my mood. Flexibility allows an individual to follow their own creativity. If you give people arbitrary rules about working 9 to 5, it is very restricting for people whose most creative time is 10 at night. I was much more creative in that environment than in a traditional office.' </p> <p>Getting the right balance of flexibility and creativity is crucial. Even the most devoted employees will struggle if there are no deadlines or other constraints placed upon them. You only have to look at the high correlation between creativity, flexibility and disaster in the pop world to see why business leaders might be confused. No amount of creativity would recompense them if their staff started behaving like Liam Gallagher. </p> <p>People who have successfully worked alone are usually very disciplined. Eve was no stranger to 16-hour days. Ruth was able to produce a book in two weeks. Perriam puts in six hours of writing a day. McDermid says: 'You have to be even more disciplined if you work on your own.' </p> <p>All beneficiaries of a new-found freedom, none of them would return to the rule-bound environment. 'It wouldn't suit me to go back to a law factory,' says Briffa. 'What killed me as a teacher was knowing what I'd be doing in May next year,' says Ruth. 'I felt shackled, trapped and tied. I hated it.' Perriam says: 'I'd have to wear make-up. You also waste a lot of energy getting there. And then there are all the distractions.' </p> <p>Strangely, however, it is often employees, rather than bosses, who oppose change, says Jan Young, architect, designer and facilitator of change for architect DEGW: 'Creating these changes often means, in practice, giving up your own desk or own base. And many people are resistant to change and say they don't have time for it.'</p>",

Other organisations, including the BBC, also want to release capital tied up in property. Abbey, one of Britain's biggest lenders, is considering other ways to cut costs. It is now piloting a branch franchise scheme, under which branches could be handed over to local managers. If this scheme is spread to its entire network, it could remove millions of pounds from the bank's running costs Soros, based in New York, is most famous for being the man who forced the ignominious exit of John Major's Conservative government from the European Exchange Rate mechanism in 1992. The financier made at least \u00a31bn in the process. But Soros funds have recently suffered losses from investments in technology stocks.",

Should this be the year that you move to the South of France, buy a country post office or settle on a Greek island? Not unless you put in some serious homework first. </p> <p>Moving to one's favourite holiday destination can be the beginning of a new life (see case studies) but it is not an easy option. </p> <p>If you are struggling to keep your life together in a city or town, it is unlikely that such a move will improve your financial or emotional position unless you choose your destination with great care. </p> <p>Oonagh Karanjia runs an agency, Crete Property Consultants, dealing in homes on the Greek Island, and has seen Britons move there with varying degrees of success. 'The ones that do best are generally those who were not looking for a dramatic change,' she says. </p> <p>Greece is one of the most popular holiday playgrounds for the British and, because of the weakness of the drachma against the pound, now seems hugely attractive to British tourists as a place to settle. </p> <p>Sue Averies-Kartanou has lived in Greece for 15 years. She and her Greek husband run shops in the busy resort of Nidri on the island of Lefkas. Aristotle Onassis's island of Scorpios is a stone's throw from Nidri. </p> <p>These are islands of crystal clear water, pure white beaches, friendly locals and cheap alcohol and cigarettes. Not surprisingly, Sue has seen an increasing number of tourists decide to make Lefkas their home. </p> <p>For many, though, the move ends disastrously. The reality is a string of poorly paid casual jobs and unless these people have left assets in Britain, it is virtually impossible for them to return because property prices will have soared. </p> <p>For some, the idyll ends with drink problems, encouraged by the cheap alcohol in Greece, and broken marriages. </p> <p>'I think quite a lot don't do their homework,' says Sue. 'There is no real structure for getting jobs unless you work on a casual basis.' </p> <p>Why, she wonders, do people assume that they will be able to manage on a part-time income in a poor country like Greece when this would not be possible in England. </p> <p>'Two hundred thousand drachmas a month (barely \u00a3400) would be considered a good living. That would be [for] people like civil servants and teachers.' </p> <p>Cigarettes and alcohol are cheap, but food, clothes and cars are not necessarily much cheaper than in the UK. Parents who bring children, says Sue, will discover that Greek parents pay for extensive private lessons in order to educate their children well. But even getting a good education will not guarantee a good living. 'There are a lot of doctors driving taxis and running tourist shops.' </p> <p>Greece has a state pension scheme and a health service, but Sue has private pensions and medical insurance because she wants extra protection. </p> <p>Those who cannot speak the language are at a particular disadvantage, and she is often called in by newcomers to help them deal with paperwork. </p> <p>She recalls one couple who rented a restaurant and did not realise they were paying rent that, by local standards, was exorbitant. It was difficult to organise supplies from wholesalers without speaking Greek. </p> <p>'People who have made a success of it have researched it and have economic security,' observes Sue. 'They haven't put all their eggs in one basket.' </p> <p>Retired people with UK pension income who buy homes on the island for extended stays tend to do well out of their moves, she says. </p> <p>Anyone contemplating migration to the island should spend a couple of hours talking to a lawyer or a well-informed local who can give them some idea of the realities. </p> <p>Oonagh agrees that people moving to their favourite holiday spot often fail to 'think it all the way through'. </p> <p>'Buying in a place that you've had a good holiday in is not a good basis for buying. Go in February, the worst month of the year [for weather], and see what life is like then.' </p> <p>Oonagh says that older couples may fail to appreciate that being together 24 hours a day poses a challenge to their marriage. </p> <p>Those who move successfully rarely do so to escape an unsatisfactory life at home, and they 'don't have it in mind to vegetate'. </p> <p><strong>Offshore, but not all at sea </strong></p> <p>Moving abroad involves more planning than you would faced with if you simply upped sticks for a favourite UK holiday spot. Martin Mullany knows the financial challenges of moving abroad as he is an independent financial adviser who recently moved to Mauritius following an excellent holiday there. </p> <p>Mullany has set up his own financial advice consultancy, Strategic Planning International. Here is his checklist for preparing such a move abroad :</p> <p>\u0095 List the factors you would take into account if you were moving within the UK, including location of your planned home in relation to shops and amenities, and access to transport, medical facilities, schools, work, and friends. Ask yourself who you know there, and how you will get to know people.</p> <p>\u0095 Find a way to speak to people in the area. The Corona Society helps people from the UK to prepare for a move abroad by putting them in touch with knowledgeable residents. It also organises briefings on the cultural and financial aspects of a move. A one-day briefing costs \u00a3250, a cultural briefing only is \u00a375 and a telephone briefing \u00a325. Tel: 0207 610 4407.</p> <p>\u0095 Consider your financial situation. Will you retire or work? Can you afford to live without working? Will you need a work permit?</p> <p>\u0095 Do some 'negative' planning. What if something or everything goes wrong? Make sure you can afford to return to the UK in an emergency. It is important to have an emergency fund. You might need to call on it for anything from a family death to a change in the political climate in the country you move to.</p> <p>\u0095 Don't rule out the possibility that you will not be able to adjust to living permanently in a culture you enjoyed in small doses on holiday.</p> <p>\u0095 Check that your will is valid where you are going. In some countries you will have to dispose of assets according to specific rules.</p> <p>\u0095 Ask the Department of Social Security for a forecast of your state pension; there is a section on the forecast form, BR19, that applies to pensions paid abroad. It may be worth making voluntary National Insurance payments to protect your state pension. But be aware that in most Commonwealth countries the UK state pension is not increased when it goes up in this country.</p> <p>\u0095 If you are investing and plan to continue, there is no change in the nature of the investments - but the vehicles you use will be different. You won't be able to use Isas or Tessas. Assuming you become a non-UK taxpayer, you will need an offshore account where interest is paid gross. For stock market investment you will probably want to consider offshore funds.</p> <p>Take care, as the regulation of funds based outside the UK is not necessarily as rigorous as in Britain. If you have substantial assets and don't feel confident about managing them yourself, find a UK adviser with detailed knowledge of the expatriate market.</p> <p>\u0095 The position with private pensions varies depending on the type of scheme.</p> <p>You won't be able to continue to contribute but will be able to keep the pensions until you want to retire.</p> <p>Find out how much they would produce. Would it be enough to maintain a reasonable lifestyle if you decide to remain abroad? How will you save for retirement when you move?</p> <p>\u0095 Consider the long term. If your eventual goal is to retire to the UK, there is no point in feeling rich in another country to find you are the poorest person in Britain on your return.</p> <p>\u0095 A large number of UK residents who go abroad to live end up returning. Keep a property in the UK so you have a home to come back to. If you do sell, invest some of the proceeds in a rental property.</p> <p>You will have to use an agent; an occupational hazard when you live miles away. You will need to pay tax on any income from the property, after expenses. You will need to complete forms to enable the agent to release rent without deduction of tax at source.</p> <p>Agents are obliged to withhold tax on the whole rent if you do not obtain clearance from the Revenue, even if you only make a 1 per cent profit.</p> <p>\u0095 Make sure your life insurance policies and any protec tion policies will still be valid. Permanent health insurance, which provides an income in case of a serious illness or disability, will probably become invalid, or the insurer would insist on repatriation if you claimed.</p> <p>\u0095 Consider private medical insurance and check that any policy you buy covers the new country.</p> <p>\u0095 Check what the tax position would be if you returned to the UK to live in the property. In some cases it is better to return to live in it for a time before selling, while for others it is best to sell while abroad.</p> <p>\u0095 You will need to ensure that you are treated as non-resident for tax purposes. Obtain forms from the Inland Revenue and complete them before leaving the UK. You normally have to be out of the country for at least six months to become non-resident but can register in advance for this status, enabling you to register for and offshore bank and savings account.</p> <p>\u0095 If you have assets to dispose of that might bring a capital gains tax bill, it is normally best to sell after leaving this country. But you should take advice on this; if you return too quickly you may have the same CGT bill as if you had not left. In some cases it is best to sell after leaving the UK but before settling in a new country whose tax laws could affect you.</p> <p>\u0095 If you have UK domicile (moving country normally only affects residence, not domicile) your estate in the UK will still be liable to inheritance tax.</p> <p>\u0095 You may need to consider whether to move assets to the new country. This depends on its taxation and how secure it is politically. Recent troubles in Zimbabwe explain why many residents in Africa invest via trusts. If you have substantial assets you will need advice.</p> <p>\u0095 When moving, check whether your destination country will make you pay duty for importing your own belongings.</p> <p>\u0095 For information on taxation of non-residents look at the Inland Revenue website, <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk</a> .</p>",

      "body": "<p>Numerous shops, restaurants and other businesses in Dublin are advertising in their windows for staff. To fill jobs at high technology companies, Irish recruitment agencies are having to scour the world. </p> <p>The Irish Republic, where emigration was the norm for generations, is now experiencing a severe labour shortage. </p> <p>The Dublin government reckons the country will need to recruit 200,000 skilled workers from overseas in the next seven years. The number of vacant semi-skilled or unskilled jobs is probably even greater. </p> <p>The booming Irish economy, the Celtic Tiger, has already attracted tens of thousands of emigrants to return home. </p> <p>In the year to April 1999, 48,000 people - many of them returnees - entered the country to live, and only 29,000 left. Net immigration since 1995 has totalled 64,000. </p> <p>Many people with no particular family connection to Ireland are also choosing it as their home. A few of the more famous examples are Marianne Faithfull, Rolling Stones singer Ronnie Wood and the BBC's John Simpson. </p> <p>So should you think about joining them? Aside from whether it could enhance your career, do the green hills, golf courses and excellent schools attract you? If they do, it is time to look at the financial prospects. </p> <p>To the casual British visitor, Ireland seems very cheap because the value of the Irish pound, which is part of the euro, has slid to the point where it costs IR\u00a31.22 to buy \u00a31 sterling. Ireland's low corporate taxes have attracted the European bases of some of the largest US companies, particularly in hi-tech industries. </p> <p>If, like Faithfull or Wood you make a living as an artist, a move is worth considering. Artists get generous tax breaks, allowing them to pay no tax at all on most of the income received from their works. </p> <p>But for normal working people, it is wise to look closely at the tax situation, as it is pretty confusing. The top rate of income tax is 44 per cent this year - down 2 per cent on last year. </p> <p>A single person goes on to the top rate after earning only IR\u00a317,000. A married couple with two incomes hits the same rate at double this (they are taxed jointly), but a couple with one income reach this level after IR\u00a328,000. </p> <p>Figures from the Dutch investment bank ABN-Amro confirm that the tax burden on single people is much higher than the UK, except for the low paid. A single person earning \u00a310,000 in the UK pays 16.6 per cent of their pay in tax and National Insurance. </p> <p>The total deductions in the Republic on IR\u00a310,000 would be only 11.6 per cent. So if you want to fill one of the many hotel, restaurant or shop jobs going begging, you could be better off. </p> <p>For skilled workers, how ever, the situation reverses. On IR\u00a325,000, the average pay in the Irish public sector, a single person pays 29.6 per cent in tax and National Insurance against 25.8 per cent in the UK. Moreover, the total deducted from those on \u00a340,000 a year in the UK is 28.3 per cent, compared with 36.1 per cent in Ireland. </p> <p>ABN-Amro concludes that Irish taxes are too high for skilled single people. </p> <p>However, if you are married, and only one of you works, you will probably be better off there due to the generous married couple's allowance. </p> <p>The other crucial thing to bear in mind is that the cost of renting or buying a home in Ireland has sky-rocketed in recent years, so even if your net earnings look good, they could all be dedicated to keeping a roof over your head. </p> <p>However, John Bradley, director of personal financial services at KPMG in Dublin, says: 'We deal with a lot of expats and the reaction I get from UK people is that a lot of them like the lifestyle. It's more laid-back, there's good golf and recreational facilities, and they like the quality of the education'. </p> <p>Whether this is enough to make you overlook paying 44 per cent tax on most of your income is a personal decision. </p> <p>So, these are the factors you should consider before crossing the Irish Sea to live: </p> <p><strong> Tax</strong></p> <p> If you move to Ireland, you will have to pay Irish taxes whether you are paid in the UK or the Republic. But if your income is from other countries, you will pay Irish taxes only on the sums that you actually bring into Ireland. This also means that non-Irish people living there can hold their savings offshore of the UK and Ireland, and not pay Irish tax on them. </p> <p>For those who do have to pay, tax is much higher now in Ireland than in the UK. The good news is that by 2002, when the next Irish general election is due, the standard rate should have reduced by 4 per cent to 20 per cent and the top rate cut by a similar percentage to 40 per cent. </p> <p>The Dublin government, aware that it needs to get more of its people doing paid work, is also moving away from giving a married couple, where only one partner works, an effective \u00a311,000 in extra tax allowances. Single person's allowances are expected to rise. </p> <p>Bear in mind that many indirect Irish taxes are higher. VAT is 21 per cent, compared to the UK's 17.5 per cent. Taxes on buying property, as you will see below, are eye-poppingly high. </p> <p><strong> Property</strong></p> <p> Irish house prices have shot up to the point where houses and flats are all but unaffordable to people on average pay. </p> <p>A three-bedroom house in a pleasant part of Dublin will probably cost in excess of IR\u00a3350,000. Rents too have soared. A two-bedroom Dublin flat can easily cost IR\u00a31,000 a month. </p> <p>The good news is that you do not pay rates or community charges in Ireland, although some councils do make smallish charges for refuse collection and the like. </p> <p>The other good news is that mortgage rates are lower than in the UK. The standard rate is between 4.8 and 4.9 per cent, although the Bank of Scotland is offering 4.19 per cent. </p> <p>You will be severely stung by stamp duties, however.

      "bodyText": "Numerous shops, restaurants and other businesses in Dublin are advertising in their windows for staff. To fill jobs at high technology companies, Irish recruitment agencies are having to scour the world. The Irish Republic, where emigration was the norm for generations, is now experiencing a severe labour shortage. The Dublin government reckons the country will need to recruit 200,000 skilled workers from overseas in the next seven years. The number of vacant semi-skilled or unskilled jobs is probably even greater. The booming Irish economy, the Celtic Tiger, has already attracted tens of thousands of emigrants to return home. In the year to April 1999, 48,000 people - many of them returnees - entered the country to live, and only 29,000 left. Net immigration since 1995 has totalled 64,000. Many people with no particular family connection to Ireland are also choosing it as their home. A few of the more famous examples are Marianne Faithfull, Rolling Stones singer Ronnie Wood and the BBC's John Simpson. So should you think about joining them? Aside from whether it could enhance your career, do the green hills, golf courses and excellent schools attract you? If they do, it is time to look at the financial prospects. To the casual British visitor, Ireland seems very cheap because the value of the Irish pound, which is part of the euro, has slid to the point where it costs IR\u00a31.22 to buy \u00a31 sterling. Ireland's low corporate taxes have attracted the European bases of some of the largest US companies, particularly in hi-tech industries. If, like Faithfull or Wood you make a living as an artist, a move is worth considering. Artists get generous tax breaks, allowing them to pay no tax at all on most of the income received from their works. But for normal working people, it is wise to look closely at the tax situation, as it is pretty confusing. The top rate of income tax is 44 per cent this year - down 2 per cent on last year. A single person goes on to the top rate after earning only IR\u00a317,000. A married couple with two incomes hits the same rate at double this (they are taxed jointly), but a couple with one income reach this level after IR\u00a328,000. Figures from the Dutch investment bank ABN-Amro confirm that the tax burden on single people is much higher than the UK, except for the low paid. A single person earning \u00a310,000 in the UK pays 16.6 per cent of their pay in tax and National Insurance. The total deductions in the Republic on IR\u00a310,000 would be only 11.6 per cent. So if you want to fill one of the many hotel, restaurant or shop jobs going begging, you could be better off. For skilled workers, how ever, the situation reverses. On IR\u00a325,000, the average pay in the Irish public sector, a single person pays 29.6 per cent in tax and National Insurance against 25.8 per cent in the UK. Moreover, the total deducted from those on \u00a340,000 a year in the UK is 28.3 per cent, compared with 36.1 per cent in Ireland. ABN-Amro concludes that Irish taxes are too high for skilled single people. However, if you are married, and only one of you works, you will probably be better off there due to the generous married couple's allowance. The other crucial thing to bear in mind is that the cost of renting or buying a home in Ireland has sky-rocketed in recent years, so even if your net earnings look good, they could all be dedicated to keeping a roof over your head. However, John Bradley, director of personal financial services at KPMG in Dublin, says: 'We deal with a lot of expats and the reaction I get from UK people is that a lot of them like the lifestyle. It's more laid-back, there's good golf and recreational facilities, and they like the quality of the education'. Whether this is enough to make you overlook paying 44 per cent tax on most of your income is a personal decision. So, these are the factors you should consider before crossing the Irish Sea to live: Tax If you move to Ireland, you will have to pay Irish taxes whether you are paid in the UK or the Republic. But if your income is from other countries, you will pay Irish taxes only on the sums that you actually bring into Ireland. This also means that non-Irish people living there can hold their savings offshore of the UK and Ireland, and not pay Irish tax on them. For those who do have to pay, tax is much higher now in Ireland than in the UK. The good news is that by 2002, when the next Irish general election is due, the standard rate should have reduced by 4 per cent to 20 per cent and the top rate cut by a similar percentage to 40 per cent. The Dublin government, aware that it needs to get more of its people doing paid work, is also moving away from giving a married couple, where only one partner works, an effective \u00a311,000 in extra tax allowances. Single person's allowances are expected to rise. Bear in mind that many indirect Irish taxes are higher. VAT is 21 per cent, compared to the UK's 17.5 per cent. Taxes on buying property, as you will see below, are eye-poppingly high. Property Irish house prices have shot up to the point where houses and flats are all but unaffordable to people on average pay. A three-bedroom house in a pleasant part of Dublin will probably cost in excess of IR\u00a3350,000. Rents too have soared. A two-bedroom Dublin flat can easily cost IR\u00a31,000 a month. The good news is that you do not pay rates or community charges in Ireland, although some councils do make smallish charges for refuse collection and the like. The other good news is that mortgage rates are lower than in the UK. The standard rate is between 4.8 and 4.9 per cent, although the Bank of Scotland is offering 4.19 per cent. You will be severely stung by stamp duties, however. The Irish government charges a whopping 5 per cent on houses worth up to IR\u00a3250,000, 7 per cent on property up to \u00a3500,000 and 9 per cent above that. The property boom has proved to be a good earner for the government. Its other charges include stamp duty on your mortgage, and land registration tax. Lawyers also get in on the act. Dublin solicitors routinely charge 1 per cent of the cost of the property for conveyancing. All in all, it is much more expensive than buying property in the UK. The government is giving tax breaks to encourage landowners to build new homes for sale but, because Ireland is in the euro, it is unable to raise interest rates to cap demand. And - despite the high prices - demand for property has not yet been choked off. Cars Cars are generally more expensive in Ireland than in the UK because of higher taxes, although the manufacturers themselves actually charge less. If you do decide to move, the best option is to take your British-registered car with you, provided you have owned it for at least six months. You will pay no extra taxes on it as long as you do not sell it for at least 12 months after your arrival. You will find that petrol is cheaper than in the UK, which is why there are few petrol stations just north of the Irish border. Health and schools You may curse the failings of the National Health Service until you have to manage without it. Unless you are claiming social security or are a pensioner, you have to pay for each visit to the doctor in Ireland - usually IR\u00a325 per consultation - for dental treatment and for all your medicines, some of which are very expensive. Many employers offer partial, or in some cases total, insurance cover. Childcare in Dublin is cheaper than in London. The charges are more in line with those in the North of England. There is a shortage of nannies and of nursery places, again due to the national shortage of labour. Irish schools, on the whole, are very good, although some parents prefer private education, which has not suffered the same fee inflation as in the UK (see case study). Many state schools are run by the Catholic church. Case study: 'We can't afford a house' Michael O'Loughlin, a screenwriter and novelist, left Ireland in the Eighties and returned two years ago to take advantage of the tax-free earnings for artists. His return was 'not in any way sentimental', he says. 'It was financially pragmatic and to see if Ireland was how I remembered - a laid-back sort of place.' He and his Dutch wife have been shocked, however, by high house prices in Dublin, and disappointed by what they see as the rampant materialism of the newly rich country. 'We came back thinking we'd rent for a while and then buy a nice house.' But they cannot afford to buy, and are fed up with the lack of regulation of the rental market, which means landlords can charge what they like, O'Loughlin says. Their 11-year-old daughter is at a private school. The fees are lower than in the UK, but he has found 'it nearly impossible to find a free school that is any good'.

      "standfirst": "The following is an edited version of the James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture, delivered by Greg Dyke, director general of the BBC, at Edinburgh's international televison festival yesterday. <br /><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/BBC/\">Special report: the BBC</a>",
      "trailText": "<p>The following is an edited version of the James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture, delivered by Greg Dyke, director general of the BBC, at Edinburgh's international televison festival yesterday. </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In 1994 my lecture was about broadcasting and politics. My concern then was that the relationship between government and broadcasters was in danger of becoming unhealthy; that as the world of broadcasting was changing broadcasters were always wanting something from the government and, as such, were less likely to be brave in their programming when standing up to the government of the day. </p> <p>I still have that concern - in fact the danger has grown. Broadcasters today want more from government than we could possibly have imagined just six years ago. That is why the government's decision to give the BBC a seven-year licence fee agreement, right through to the end of the current BBC charter, is important. It gives the BBC the freedom and independence to be brave. </p> <p>But tonight I don't plan to talk about politics, I want to talk about change and why it is difficult to bring about in an organisation like the BBC. I believe the stark choice facing the BBC today is that we either change or we simply manage decline gracefully, and none of us joined the BBC to do that. </p> <p>One thing I have learned in my years in the television industry is that money matters when you're trying to make outstanding programmes. I believe one of the problems of BBC television today is that too many of our services have been underfunded. BBC1 certainly needs more money, particularly for drama and quality entertainment, and two of our digital services, BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge, were started without enough money to commission truly original and inspiring programmes. </p> <p>If we want to spend more money on our traditional services, and we do need to, there are certain consequences. First we have to find the money, and second we have to limit our plans for new services to what we can afford. </p> <p>I believe the potential for savings is significant. The BBC currently spends 24% of its income on running the institution of the BBC. Our target is to reduce that figure to 15% over the next three years which will give us an extra \u00a3200m a year to spend on programmes and services if we achieve it. </p> <p>I also believe we can increase our commercial income. </p> <p>The second thing we have to do, if we want better funded services, is to limit our ambitions for expansion. We cannot possibly afford to have a tank on every lawn, or compete in every area of the market place. </p> <p>In this financial year we will be spending \u00a3100m more on programmes than last year. Next year we plan to increase that by a further \u00a3250m above inflation and the year after by another \u00a3130m. That means in the year 2002/3 we will be spending \u00a3480m a year more on our programmes and ser vices than we spent last year - a 30% real increase in programme spend over just three years. This amounts to the biggest increase in programme expenditure in BBC history. </p> <p>So what are we planning to do with the money? </p> <p>We believe that in the age of digital television it will not be sufficient for the BBC to offer only two mixed genre channels which are somehow supposed to meet the needs of everyone. We need a more coherent portfolio of channels. </p> <p>As we are inevitably constrained by money, this means we must limit the size of this portfolio. But there is another more important reason for limiting the number of channels we plan, and that is the principle of universality. What universality means is making all our publicly funded services available in all homes. </p> <p>We must avoid the emergence of a digital underclass, a world where some are information rich while others are information poor. </p> <p>In order to achieve this principle of universality it means we are only going to offer a portfolio of channels now, which, within a reasonable period of time, will be available in every household in the land. The government's proposals for analogue switch-off, possibly in the latter part of this decade, will make this achievable. </p> <p>In practice what all this means is that we believe we should offer a portfolio of seven services across five channels. </p> <p>BBC1 and BBC2 will continue as the mainstays of BBC television for the foreseeable future and be the only BBC channels available in every home until analogue switch-off. </p> <p>Getting these channels right for the future is a big challenge. In the early years BBC1 and BBC2 will still have to be aimed at people who only have analogue television, the majority of homes, until at least 2003. However, over time they will need to evolve to become part of a BBC five channel offering which will eventually be available in every home. </p> <p>BBC1 needs to have a greater impact on people's lives. While this may mean that some old faithfuls disappear and others move from the fringe of BBC1 to peak time on BBC2, it does not mean we are banishing all current affairs, documentaries, religion and arts to other channels. Far from it. But programming in these genres, just as in drama and entertainment, needs to be more engaging, more exciting, more gripping if it is to be on BBC1. </p> <p>Our aim is to make BBC1 the gold standard of mainstream television. </p> <p>All this is going to cost, and we plan a major injection of cash. More than half of the extra money to be spent on the BBC overall will go on improving and modernising BBC1 and BBC2, with most going on to BBC1. Next year alone BBC1's budget will be increased by \u00a395m and the year after by a further \u00a355m, with a lot of this additional money to be spent on drama. </p> <p>Let me move on to BBC2. This is a success story with the channel achieving a higher share of the audience now than it had 10 years ago. But it is also a channel with a split personality. It's the channel of the Open University at the same as being the channel of Gimme Gimme Gimme and the League of Gentlemen. </p> <p>In the long term we plan that BBC2 will increasingly focus on intelligent specialist factual programmes, our key leisure and lifestyle programmes, thoughtful analysis, creatively ambitious drama and comedy, and specialist sports. </p> <p>That won't be for some years, maybe not until analogue switch-off. Until then BBC2 will continue to offer a rich and diverse range of programmes. It will still be the testbed for edgy comedy and entertainment aimed primarily at young audiences, some of which will graduate to BBC1. It will retain, of course, its wide ranging commitment to serious programmes of all kinds. It will also provide a peak time home for some of the programming which is currently shown late night on BBC1. </p> <p>Now for the new channels. Imaginatively we've given them the working titles of BBC3 and BBC4. </p> <p>BBC3 will offer original British comedy, drama and music as well as providing arts, education and social action programming delivered in a way likely to be attractive to a young audience. We've also been piloting a very different sort of news bulletin that breaks many of the conventions of traditional news services. </p> <p>I suspect in developing BBC3 we will need to break a lot more rules before we're through. BBC3 will emerge out of BBC Choice but will have a significantly higher budget. </p> <p>BBC4 will be very different. It will be unashamedly intellectual, a mixture of Radios 3 and 4 on television. </p> <p>It will be based around arts, challenging music, ideas and in-depth discussion. It will be serious in intent but unstuffy and contemporary. It will be a style of television which you can't find anywhere else. We know there's a potential audience, the challenge is to attract it to the channel. </p> <p>I am also very keen for us to deliver a rolling breakfast time business news on BBC4. Just as interest in politics has waned in recent years interest in business has grown. I don't think British television has yet caught up with that. </p> <p>BBC4 will be developed out of BBC Knowledge. But again it will have a significantly higher budget. In all we plan to spend \u00a3130m a year on BBCs 3 and 4. </p> <p>Our fifth channel will be News 24.

      "bodyText": "In 1994 my lecture was about broadcasting and politics. My concern then was that the relationship between government and broadcasters was in danger of becoming unhealthy; that as the world of broadcasting was changing broadcasters were always wanting something from the government and, as such, were less likely to be brave in their programming when standing up to the government of the day. I still have that concern - in fact the danger has grown. Broadcasters today want more from government than we could possibly have imagined just six years ago. That is why the government's decision to give the BBC a seven-year licence fee agreement, right through to the end of the current BBC charter, is important. It gives the BBC the freedom and independence to be brave. But tonight I don't plan to talk about politics, I want to talk about change and why it is difficult to bring about in an organisation like the BBC. I believe the stark choice facing the BBC today is that we either change or we simply manage decline gracefully, and none of us joined the BBC to do that. One thing I have learned in my years in the television industry is that money matters when you're trying to make outstanding programmes. I believe one of the problems of BBC television today is that too many of our services have been underfunded. BBC1 certainly needs more money, particularly for drama and quality entertainment, and two of our digital services, BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge, were started without enough money to commission truly original and inspiring programmes. If we want to spend more money on our traditional services, and we do need to, there are certain consequences. First we have to find the money, and second we have to limit our plans for new services to what we can afford. I believe the potential for savings is significant. The BBC currently spends 24% of its income on running the institution of the BBC. Our target is to reduce that figure to 15% over the next three years which will give us an extra \u00a3200m a year to spend on programmes and services if we achieve it. I also believe we can increase our commercial income. The second thing we have to do, if we want better funded services, is to limit our ambitions for expansion. We cannot possibly afford to have a tank on every lawn, or compete in every area of the market place. In this financial year we will be spending \u00a3100m more on programmes than last year. Next year we plan to increase that by a further \u00a3250m above inflation and the year after by another \u00a3130m. That means in the year 2002/3 we will be spending \u00a3480m a year more on our programmes and ser vices than we spent last year - a 30% real increase in programme spend over just three years. This amounts to the biggest increase in programme expenditure in BBC history. So what are we planning to do with the money? We believe that in the age of digital television it will not be sufficient for the BBC to offer only two mixed genre channels which are somehow supposed to meet the needs of everyone. We need a more coherent portfolio of channels. As we are inevitably constrained by money, this means we must limit the size of this portfolio. But there is another more important reason for limiting the number of channels we plan, and that is the principle of universality. What universality means is making all our publicly funded services available in all homes. We must avoid the emergence of a digital underclass, a world where some are information rich while others are information poor. In order to achieve this principle of universality it means we are only going to offer a portfolio of channels now, which, within a reasonable period of time, will be available in every household in the land. The government's proposals for analogue switch-off, possibly in the latter part of this decade, will make this achievable. In practice what all this means is that we believe we should offer a portfolio of seven services across five channels. BBC1 and BBC2 will continue as the mainstays of BBC television for the foreseeable future and be the only BBC channels available in every home until analogue switch-off. Getting these channels right for the future is a big challenge. In the early years BBC1 and BBC2 will still have to be aimed at people who only have analogue television, the majority of homes, until at least 2003. However, over time they will need to evolve to become part of a BBC five channel offering which will eventually be available in every home. BBC1 needs to have a greater impact on people's lives. While this may mean that some old faithfuls disappear and others move from the fringe of BBC1 to peak time on BBC2, it does not mean we are banishing all current affairs, documentaries, religion and arts to other channels. Far from it. But programming in these genres, just as in drama and entertainment, needs to be more engaging, more exciting, more gripping if it is to be on BBC1. Our aim is to make BBC1 the gold standard of mainstream television. All this is going to cost, and we plan a major injection of cash. More than half of the extra money to be spent on the BBC overall will go on improving and modernising BBC1 and BBC2, with most going on to BBC1. Next year alone BBC1's budget will be increased by \u00a395m and the year after by a further \u00a355m, with a lot of this additional money to be spent on drama. Let me move on to BBC2. This is a success story with the channel achieving a higher share of the audience now than it had 10 years ago. But it is also a channel with a split personality. It's the channel of the Open University at the same as being the channel of Gimme Gimme Gimme and the League of Gentlemen. In the long term we plan that BBC2 will increasingly focus on intelligent specialist factual programmes, our key leisure and lifestyle programmes, thoughtful analysis, creatively ambitious drama and comedy, and specialist sports. That won't be for some years, maybe not until analogue switch-off. Until then BBC2 will continue to offer a rich and diverse range of programmes. It will still be the testbed for edgy comedy and entertainment aimed primarily at young audiences, some of which will graduate to BBC1. It will retain, of course, its wide ranging commitment to serious programmes of all kinds. It will also provide a peak time home for some of the programming which is currently shown late night on BBC1. Now for the new channels. Imaginatively we've given them the working titles of BBC3 and BBC4. BBC3 will offer original British comedy, drama and music as well as providing arts, education and social action programming delivered in a way likely to be attractive to a young audience. We've also been piloting a very different sort of news bulletin that breaks many of the conventions of traditional news services. I suspect in developing BBC3 we will need to break a lot more rules before we're through. BBC3 will emerge out of BBC Choice but will have a significantly higher budget. BBC4 will be very different. It will be unashamedly intellectual, a mixture of Radios 3 and 4 on television. It will be based around arts, challenging music, ideas and in-depth discussion. It will be serious in intent but unstuffy and contemporary. It will be a style of television which you can't find anywhere else. We know there's a potential audience, the challenge is to attract it to the channel. I am also very keen for us to deliver a rolling breakfast time business news on BBC4. Just as interest in politics has waned in recent years interest in business has grown. I don't think British television has yet caught up with that. BBC4 will be developed out of BBC Knowledge. But again it will have a significantly higher budget. In all we plan to spend \u00a3130m a year on BBCs 3 and 4. Our fifth channel will be News 24. It seems obvious to me that the world's biggest news gatherer, the BBC, needs a 24 hour news service as part of its channel mix. Increasingly this is how the viewer will watch news. We saw the value of News 24 when reporting the Concorde air crash in Paris. Instead of a news flash on BBC1, we simply switched to the News 24 service. That's the first time that has happened, but it is the pattern for the future. We plan two new children's services to be played in the daytime on the channels occupied by BBC3 and BBC4 in the evenings. One will be for pre-school children and the second for children aged between six and 13. We have done preliminary research on our proposals for BBC3, BBC4 and the children's channels and the response has been very positive. However we cannot go ahead with these without further consulting the public and then seeking the approval of the secretary of state. We plan to do both this autumn. We plan to continue with BBC Parliament on the same basis as now, which means it will be fully available on digital satellite and cable but digital terrestrial homes will only receive an audio signal.

Our channel strategy is a means of achieving this - a way of commissioning, producing and broadcasting original British programmes of all kinds on a mix of channels which will make sense to audiences in the digital age. Over time the channels will inevitably change but the commitment to creating exciting British programmes will not. Making television is a cre ative process and if we really aspire to be the engine of a new era of great British production in all genres of programming we have to be able to attract the best talent to work with us. This means creating inside the BBC an environment in which talented people can flourish. My definition of the purpose of the BBC in the digital age is to make and commission great British programmes.

Only this line-up is at a linen-covered table on which are laid more knives, forks and spoons than you tend to find in the cutlery section of your average department store. </p> <p>Exhibit one is brought forward for inspection: a vast, sky-blue plate bearing a stupendous looking salad of young broad beans, chickpeas, fried courgette strips, mixed baby lettuce leaves and golden courgette flowers, all tossed in a simple lemon juice and olive oil dressing. If anything, the taste is even more staggering than the appearance: fresh, vibrant, light as air. </p> <p>It is not hard to spot whodunnit, either: he's standing right in front of us wearing a big white hat. Chef Polycarpos Demetriou is familiarising his pupils with the food of his homeland, and this spectacular salad is just the beginning of lesson one in a Greek Cypriot cooking holiday. </p> <p>It's a belt-challenging introductory seminar that continues through a salad of tomatoes, basil, oregano and anari (a local cheese that's a bit like ricotta); a Greek salad made spiky with fresh coriander and wild greens; king prawns cooked in a fresh tomato, garlic, feta and ouzo sauce; red mullet fillet stuffed with chard, pinenuts and pesto; snapper fillet with tomato and herb sauce; chicken breast with okra; lamb fillet with a feta, spring onion and pinenut crust; all rounded off with a bewildering selection of honey-sweet pastries and washed down with what seem like gallons of local wine. </p> <p>Come to think of it, that is gallons of local wine, judging by the empty bottles standing at the far end of the table like skittles in a bowling rink. Polycarpos Demetriou doesn't mess about when it comes to the dining experience. </p> <p>And all this is only lunch on the first day. Somehow, my digestive system will have to deal with that little lot before we resume our studies at dinner tonight. As for the testing examination that looms over the next week... Well, I'm here to learn, so I'll just have to give it my best shot. </p> <p>Open any glossy magazine or turn on the television, and chances are you'll come across lip-smacking images of food. Not any old food, mind; more often than not, the dishes will be inspired by the cooking of the Mediterranean. Anywhere in the Med, that is, as long as it's not Greece. Be honest, who do you know who has gone on holiday to Greece or its islands and come back eulogising about the food? We're not talking Italy here, and there really is only so much grilled meat and Greek salad that a person can take. </p> <p>But that's where you'd be wrong, Polycarpos says. That Greek cuisine has, at best, an indifferent reputation boils down to one simple fact: something, somewhere, has gone seriously awry with its PR. After all, the region boasts similar produce to that found in the larders of Italy, Spain and France; some of it - Kalamata olives, the ubiquitous lamb, the mountain herbs and the honey - is even lauded as the best of its type in the world. </p> <p>In fact, Polycarpos is so fed up with Europe's perception of Greece as the greasy spoon in the continental culinary constellation that he's opened a cooking school - lessons are shared between his base, the Annabelle Hotel, in Paphos, southwest Cyprus, and the Anassa, a little way up the coast in Latchi - to show us how wrong we are. Which is where we came in... </p> <p>In between meals, Polycarpos takes us up to Ktima, Paphos old town, at the top of an escarpment that overlooks the harbour. The market there is a shadow of its former self, he explains, but still offers an illuminating insight into the Cypriot way with food. And, anyway, before we get down to cooking lunch, we really ought to buy something to work with. </p> <p>The old municipal market doesn't look up to much at first: its covered corridors are festooned with lairy acrylic football shirts and tacky imitations of the famed local lacework. So where's the meat, the fish, the fruit and veg? The heartbeat of the market, the food, has been forced outside, on to a shady square nearby. </p> <p>Here, mounds of juicy citrus fruits vie for the attention with peppers and tomatoes as gnarled and chemically-untreated as the land that bore them; and a couple of understandably terrified looking rabbits quiver in a cage at the feet of a man selling lamb preserved in salt, a regional speciality that just cries out for a cold beer. Each stall specialises in just one or two products - this is no place for corporate producers - and there's not a plastic packet or cling-film wrap in sight. Everything looks good enough to, well, eat. </p> <p>All chefs are obsessed with the quality of their ingredients, but Polycarpos has taken that preoccupation to another level entirely. Paphos market, for all its surface appeal, has lost much of its bustle over the years, he says, so he persuaded his bosses - the owners of the appealingly relaxed Annabelle and its even more upmarket sister hotel, the Anassa - to set up their own farm. </p> <p>\"It's a pity, but our local suppliers just couldn't guarantee the calibre of produce we needed any more,\" he says, by way of explanation for the 125-acre site a few miles outside town. </p> <p> Polycarpos cuts an unlikely figure as the new kid on the cooking-school block, however. For one thing, he has been slaving over a hot stove for more than a quarter of a century now and, at nearly 50, he's no spring chicken - he even walks at a tilt, as if in a state of permanent readiness for the moment when he'll again be stooping over his pots and pans. For another, he's a total idealist - listen to him describe the provenance of a dish, or watch him mix just the right amount of this with a splash of that, and he comes across more as an unofficial ambassador for food than a chef. </p> <p>A few meals into the course - watching, learning, getting fatter - and you soon realise that Polycarpos's mission to raise the profile of his national table isn't impossible, either. Greek food, in particular as it is interpreted here, really can be quite stunning, as revelatory to the tastebuds as that first proper Italian or French meal. </p> <p>Best of all, the whole experience is not one of those mind-blowingly intricate cheffy extravaganzas for which you need a diploma just to work out which pan should be used for what. Polycarpos is not into that sort of thing at all. Most of his dishes are so unexpectedly quick and uncomplicated to prepare that even inexperienced cooks will come away feeling that they could take on Gordon Ramsay. What with the flash-Harry antics of your average celebrity chef, Polycarpos's simple approach of just letting the food speak for itself is something of a novelty, too. </p> <p>And blow me if it doesn't work: seven days later, we're not only completely stuffed, but inspired, too. In fact, one member of the class is so overcome with the realisation that she really will be able to recreate these dishes at home that she is seriously considering kidnapping Polycarpos and smuggling him on to the plane as excess baggage: \"He's so sweet that you want to eat him up,\" she explains. \"Just like one of his puddings.\" </p> <p><strong>What Bob learned to cook on his holiday</strong></p> <p> Trachanas (couscous and yoghurt soup)<br> Serves 4-6 </p> <p><strong> Ingredients:</strong> 1.5 litres chicken stock; 70g couscous; 30ml fresh lemon juice; 200ml Greek yoghurt, strained; 75ml double cream; 2 egg yolks; 100g halloumi, grated. </p> <p><strong> Method:</strong> Place the stock in a large saucepan and bring to the boil. Add the couscous and lemon juice, return to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. </p> <p>In a bowl, combine the yoghurt, cream, egg yolks and halloumi. Pour in a little of the hot couscous and stock, whisking all the time, then whisk in a further 150ml of hot stock. Pour into the soup pan, still whisking, and bring back to the boil. </p> <p>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until slightly thickened, then season with a little salt and black pepper (take care, as halloumi is rather salty). </p> <p><strong> Lamb fillet with strained yoghurt, feta and pinenuts</strong><br> Serves 4 </p> <p><strong> Ingredients:</strong> 4 x 140g pieces lamb fillet, seasoned with salt and pepper; 2 tbsp olive oil; 175ml Greek yoghurt; 115g feta, crumbled; 60g toasted pinenuts; 15ml spring onion greens, chopped; fresh basil, chopped; 2 egg yolks; 1/2 tsp ground cumin; 1 tbsp olive oil. </p> <p><strong> Method:</strong> Preheat oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Heat a large frying pan until hot, then add 2 tbsp olive oil and the seasoned lamb. Fry for a couple of minutes on each side, until browned. Remove from the pan and set aside. Pat the fillets dry with kitchen paper. </p> <p>Place all the remaining ingredients in a large bowl, except half the pinenuts, and mix until well combined. Chill in the fridge for 10 minutes. Divide the yoghurt mixture equally into four, and spoon over one side of each lamb fillet. Scatter over the remaining pinenuts, then place the meat on a roasting tray and return to the fridge for 10 minutes. Remove, and cook in the oven for 5-8 minutes, depending how pink you like your lamb. Allow to rest for a few minutes before serving, sliced thickly. </p> <p><strong> Halouvas with walnuts </strong><br> Serves 8 </p> <p><strong> Ingredients:</strong> 250g semolina; 75ml corn oil; 1 litre hot water; 250g walnuts, chopped; 100ml honey; 150g caster sugar; 1 tbsp rosewater; 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon; 8 walnut halves. </p> <p><strong> Method:</strong> Lightly oil 8 individual ramekins or dariole moulds. Heat a large saucepan until hot, add the oil and, when it is hot, pour in the semolina and, stirring all the time, cook for 5 minutes until lightly toasted. Pour in the hot water, continuing to stir, and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for a few minutes, then add the remaining ingredients except the walnut halves, stirring all the while. </p> <p>Cook for 10 minutes until thickened and all the liquid is absorbed, then spoon into the prepared ramekins. Allow to cool slightly before placing in the fridge to chill, preferably overnight. </p> <p>To serve, turn out on to individual plates and garnish with the walnut halves. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Bob Granleese travelled to Cyprus with The Mediterranean Experience (020-8445 6000). The first of Polycarpos Demetriou's seven-day cooking schools, comprising three nights at the Annabelle Hotel, Paphos, and four at the Anassa, Latchi, runs from November 6-13, and costs \u00a31,395 per person, including return flights, seven nights' accommodation half-board and all cooking lessons.

And blow me if it doesn't work: seven days later, we're not only completely stuffed, but inspired, too. In fact, one member of the class is so overcome with the realisation that she really will be able to recreate these dishes at home that she is seriously considering kidnapping Polycarpos and smuggling him on to the plane as excess baggage: \"He's so sweet that you want to eat him up,\" she explains. \"Just like one of his puddings.\" What Bob learned to cook on his holiday Trachanas (couscous and yoghurt soup) Serves 4-6 Ingredients: 1.5 litres chicken stock; 70g couscous; 30ml fresh lemon juice; 200ml Greek yoghurt, strained; 75ml double cream; 2 egg yolks; 100g halloumi, grated. Method: Place the stock in a large saucepan and bring to the boil. Add the couscous and lemon juice, return to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. In a bowl, combine the yoghurt, cream, egg yolks and halloumi. Pour in a little of the hot couscous and stock, whisking all the time, then whisk in a further 150ml of hot stock. Pour into the soup pan, still whisking, and bring back to the boil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until slightly thickened, then season with a little salt and black pepper (take care, as halloumi is rather salty). Lamb fillet with strained yoghurt, feta and pinenuts Serves 4 Ingredients: 4 x 140g pieces lamb fillet, seasoned with salt and pepper; 2 tbsp olive oil; 175ml Greek yoghurt; 115g feta, crumbled; 60g toasted pinenuts; 15ml spring onion greens, chopped; fresh basil, chopped; 2 egg yolks; 1/2 tsp ground cumin; 1 tbsp olive oil. Method: Preheat oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Heat a large frying pan until hot, then add 2 tbsp olive oil and the seasoned lamb. Fry for a couple of minutes on each side, until browned. Remove from the pan and set aside. Pat the fillets dry with kitchen paper. Place all the remaining ingredients in a large bowl, except half the pinenuts, and mix until well combined. Chill in the fridge for 10 minutes. Divide the yoghurt mixture equally into four, and spoon over one side of each lamb fillet. Scatter over the remaining pinenuts, then place the meat on a roasting tray and return to the fridge for 10 minutes. Remove, and cook in the oven for 5-8 minutes, depending how pink you like your lamb. Allow to rest for a few minutes before serving, sliced thickly. Halouvas with walnuts Serves 8 Ingredients: 250g semolina; 75ml corn oil; 1 litre hot water; 250g walnuts, chopped; 100ml honey; 150g caster sugar; 1 tbsp rosewater; 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon; 8 walnut halves. Method: Lightly oil 8 individual ramekins or dariole moulds. Heat a large saucepan until hot, add the oil and, when it is hot, pour in the semolina and, stirring all the time, cook for 5 minutes until lightly toasted. Pour in the hot water, continuing to stir, and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for a few minutes, then add the remaining ingredients except the walnut halves, stirring all the while. Cook for 10 minutes until thickened and all the liquid is absorbed, then spoon into the prepared ramekins. Allow to cool slightly before placing in the fridge to chill, preferably overnight. To serve, turn out on to individual plates and garnish with the walnut halves. The practicals Bob Granleese travelled to Cyprus with The Mediterranean Experience (020-8445 6000). The first of Polycarpos Demetriou's seven-day cooking schools, comprising three nights at the Annabelle Hotel, Paphos, and four at the Anassa, Latchi, runs from November 6-13, and costs \u00a31,395 per person, including return flights, seven nights' accommodation half-board and all cooking lessons. Polycarpos Demetriou's book, Food From The Village, is published by Thanos Press, priced \u00a315, and is available from Thanos Sales Office, 2nd Floor, 676 High Road, London N12 8LB.",

No: it's got a waterproof outer shell, with an adjustable cinch at the back and a loop for attaching it to belt or rucksack. Two more little loops for a chin strap, if you want one. And - best of all - ear flaps. Ear flaps? I'm going to look like Sherlock Holmes. Yes, but a warm Sherlock Holmes. And everyone else on Striding Edge will be wearing one? Probably, but you can exchange the knowing smiles of the connoisseur. Can I wear it down the pub? A bit eccentric for everyday street use. But some people like that sort of thing. Can't I just wear my old stripy knitted job? Only if you want itchy hair and a serious image problem. Okay, you win: what does it cost? \u00a330: call 01539 740840 for stockists. Some of the competitors are cheaper.",

But away from the capital, the Czech Republic has much to offer and is largely unvisited. </p> <p><strong> Music festivals</strong></p> <p> Music lovers are not restricted to the world-famous Prague Spring Festival and the concerts of the Czech Philharmonic. There are many other musical gems on offer throughout the year (see <a href=\"http://www.musica.cz\">www.musica.cz</a>) including the Karlovy Vary Festival of Early Music during the last week in July, the International Piper Festival at the Museum of Musical Instruments in Luby in August, and the international singing competition in Ceske Budejovice in August and September. </p> <p>The Valtice Festival in southern Moravia is held annually at the end of this month in an unrestored 12th-century castle in the middle of the country's best wine region. You can spend a weekend listening to concerts and opera, picnicking in beautiful scenery and sampling the local wine. </p> <p><strong> Great outdoors</strong></p> <p> If, after that, you feel in need of some exercise head a few miles north-west to the Czech answer to the Pennine Way. Greenway is a hiking trail stretching along 250 miles of unspoilt land between Vienna and Prague. </p> <p>The trail heads west along the Dyje river and the Vltava river, crossing southern Moravia and south Bohemia, taking in the historic towns of Telc, Trebon and - one of the country's gems - the Unesco World Heritage Site of <a href=\"http://www.malecek.cz/hlavni_a.html\">Cesky Krumlov</a>, before twisting north to Prague. </p> <p>Twenty miles north-east of Prague, the village of Ostra offers enough activities to fill a whole week. A renovated turn-of-the-century school houses a health and beauty centre providing herb baths, mud therapies or aromatherapy massages. There's a lake for swimming, bicycling paths that run deep into the forest alongside the Labe river and walking trails through nature reserves. Accommodation is available in a local campsite or in wooden cabins, reminiscent of holidays in the communist era. </p> <p>The star attraction in Ostra is the Botanicus complex - nine acres of organic gardens, constructed last spring and based on original family-ownership plots of a century ago. A kitchen garden, English rose arbour, medicinal plant collection, Chinese garden, croquet lawn edged by limes and three hedge-mazes are open to the public between April and the end of September for around \u00a32 a head. The house attached to the gardens has a Great Guild Hall where medieval banquets can be laid on for up to 40 people. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.ecn.cz/greenways\">Greenway trail</a>: 00420 542 218350; fax: 00 420 542 221744 (e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:greenways @ecn.cz\">greenways@ecn.cz</a>). <br><a href=\"http://www.botanicus.cz\">Botanicus</a>: 00420 325 551558; fax: 00420 325 552121 (e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:botanicus @botanicus.cz\">botanicus @botanicus.cz</a>) </p> <p><strong> Jewish heritage</strong></p> <p> Since the fall of communism a decade ago, Jewish families from around the world have been able to gain access to their heritage for the first time in over 40 years. The tours run by Sylvie Wittmann run from March to the end of December, taking in the Jewish ghetto in the southern city of Trebic - the best- preserved Jewish quarter in Europe - and, further to the east, the medieval city of Telc. You can take a day trip by bus from Prague to the 18th-century fortress town of Terezin, which was converted by the Nazis into a concentration camp. Pilsen, an hour's drive to the east of Prague, is home to Europe's second largest synagogue although it is probably more widely known for the Pilsner Urquell brewery. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.wittmann-tours.com\">Wittmann Tours</a>: 00 420 2 222524 72 (email: <a href=\"mailto:sylvie@wittmann-tours.com\">sylvie@wittmann-tours.com</a>). </p> <p><strong> Spas</strong></p> <p> The cream of European royalty used to take their cures at Karlsbad, two hours' drive north of Prague, and it is fast being restored to its former glory. Visitors, mostly Russian and German, imbibe the salty spa waters, said to be particularly good for gastric complaints, and breathe in the cool forest air above the city. The town is home to some of the country's grandest hotels (see <a href=\"http://www.hotel-dvorak.cz\">www.hotel-dvorak.cz</a>) and some splendid golf courses. In July, it hosts an international film festival (<a href=\"http://www.iffkv.cz\">www.iffkv.cz</a>)</p> <p><strong> Castles</strong></p> <p> This is castle country. Apart from the 300 or so that are up for sale (appointments with estate agents can easily be arranged during your trip), there are plenty to visit, most of which are desperately in need of your cash to overhaul the plumbing and upholster the furniture. </p> <p>Tom Zahn of Pathfinders organises weekend \"getaway\" tours taking in some of the best. If you spend a long weekend cycling, hiking and canoeing (three nights, \u00a3138) in the Sumava region, you get to stay at the Hotel Atava in Rabi, which claims to be \"the largest castle ruin in Bohemia\". </p> <p>Other weekends include horseriding, concerts, visiting a medieval festival, and celebrating the wine harvest in Valtice.

Riding lessons cost less than \u00a34.50 an hour, and you can join the annual October drag hunt for \u00a350 a head followed by a castle ball for \u00a324 a ticket. The following day, most participants head over to the nearby Great Pardubice Steeplechase, one of the world's toughest horse races. </p> <p> For the Kinsky Stud, call Liba Pulpan on 00420 448596035.

Great outdoors If, after that, you feel in need of some exercise head a few miles north-west to the Czech answer to the Pennine Way. Greenway is a hiking trail stretching along 250 miles of unspoilt land between Vienna and Prague. The trail heads west along the Dyje river and the Vltava river, crossing southern Moravia and south Bohemia, taking in the historic towns of Telc, Trebon and - one of the country's gems - the Unesco World Heritage Site of Cesky Krumlov, before twisting north to Prague. Twenty miles north-east of Prague, the village of Ostra offers enough activities to fill a whole week. A renovated turn-of-the-century school houses a health and beauty centre providing herb baths, mud therapies or aromatherapy massages. There's a lake for swimming, bicycling paths that run deep into the forest alongside the Labe river and walking trails through nature reserves. Accommodation is available in a local campsite or in wooden cabins, reminiscent of holidays in the communist era. The star attraction in Ostra is the Botanicus complex - nine acres of organic gardens, constructed last spring and based on original family-ownership plots of a century ago. A kitchen garden, English rose arbour, medicinal plant collection, Chinese garden, croquet lawn edged by limes and three hedge-mazes are open to the public between April and the end of September for around \u00a32 a head. The house attached to the gardens has a Great Guild Hall where medieval banquets can be laid on for up to 40 people.

The tours run by Sylvie Wittmann run from March to the end of December, taking in the Jewish ghetto in the southern city of Trebic - the best- preserved Jewish quarter in Europe - and, further to the east, the medieval city of Telc. You can take a day trip by bus from Prague to the 18th-century fortress town of Terezin, which was converted by the Nazis into a concentration camp. Pilsen, an hour's drive to the east of Prague, is home to Europe's second largest synagogue although it is probably more widely known for the Pilsner Urquell brewery. Wittmann Tours: 00 420 2 222524 72 (email: sylvie@wittmann-tours.com). Spas The cream of European royalty used to take their cures at Karlsbad, two hours' drive north of Prague, and it is fast being restored to its former glory. Visitors, mostly Russian and German, imbibe the salty spa waters, said to be particularly good for gastric complaints, and breathe in the cool forest air above the city. The town is home to some of the country's grandest hotels (see www.hotel-dvorak.cz) and some splendid golf courses. In July, it hosts an international film festival (www.iffkv.cz) Castles This is castle country. Apart from the 300 or so that are up for sale (appointments with estate agents can easily be arranged during your trip), there are plenty to visit, most of which are desperately in need of your cash to overhaul the plumbing and upholster the furniture. Tom Zahn of Pathfinders organises weekend \"getaway\" tours taking in some of the best. If you spend a long weekend cycling, hiking and canoeing (three nights, \u00a3138) in the Sumava region, you get to stay at the Hotel Atava in Rabi, which claims to be \"the largest castle ruin in Bohemia\". Other weekends include horseriding, concerts, visiting a medieval festival, and celebrating the wine harvest in Valtice. Pathfinders provides guides and transport and will also organise balloon rides, bungee jumping or shooting. Pathfinders: Na Homoli 5, Prague 4, 143 00 Czech Republic; tel/fax: 00 420 2 4440 0472 (e-mail: getaways@pathfinders.cz). Horse riding If taking to the gallops is more to your liking, the Kinsky stud, established in 1832 by Count Octavian Kinsky at Clumec and Cidlinou in east Bohemia, holds its annual Feast of the Kinsky Horses every June. Riding lessons cost less than \u00a34.50 an hour, and you can join the annual October drag hunt for \u00a350 a head followed by a castle ball for \u00a324 a ticket. The following day, most participants head over to the nearby Great Pardubice Steeplechase, one of the world's toughest horse races. For the Kinsky Stud, call Liba Pulpan on 00420 448596035. Drag hunt, call Nader Safari on 00420 606 614613. Fishing and skiing British-based Academy Tours organises fishing holidays in southern Bohemia and skiing trips to the Krkonose mountains close to the Polish and German borders. Resorts have slopes suitable for all abilities, and services are improving fast. A week-long skiing holiday will set you back around \u00a3200.

The practicals Go flies Stansted to Prague from \u00a368 return, Czech Airlines (020-7255 1898) from \u00a3164 return. Car hire is cheap if you go to a local operator rather than the international chains, although there's hardly a place that can't be reached via bus or train (information in English: bus details, train details).

      "body": "<p>Bruges is an eccentric mix of darkness and beauty. The beauty comes from 100km of winding canals lined with gabled houses. Darkness is in the works of its artists, the Flemish Primitives, who specialised in giant paintings of disembowelment; and Heironymous Bosch's scenes of bizarre horror in its galleries. </p> <p>From the 12th to the 15th centuries, Bruges was the financial hub of Europe, the site of the world's first stock exchange and the centre of the diamond and lace trades. Then darkness descended when the waterway that linked it to the sea began to silt up; merchants and traders left, and the city slept for 400 years. </p> <p>In the late 19th century, the author Georges Rodenbach wrote a novel set in the city's abandoned streets, called Bruges the Dead, and the Belgian elite started to return </p> <p>Because Bruges was never redeveloped, it is now the best-preserved medieval city in western Europe. There are no billboards, no high rises, few neon signs and traffic is regulated. You can walk for three hours without leaving cobbled streets. The only sound is clarion bells and the clatter of horse-drawn carriages. </p> <p>Four hours from London by train, it makes for a convenient city break. More than two million visitors a year come to see its art and architecture, taste its beers and visit its antiques markets; in 2002, Bruges will be European city of culture. But away from the centre and within walking distance of the main attractions, there's another side to the city in the basement jazz clubs, karaoke bars, design shops and organic restaurants. The city is compact, so the main sights and the underground scene are within walkingdistance of each other. </p> <p>There are also lush, canal-side lawns, where you can enjoy a picnic and watch the world go by - in Bruges' case an odd mix of artists, Benedictine nuns and yuppies who do the hour's commute to Brussels each morning. And, because the city falls on the Flemish side of Belgium's linguistic divide, ordering in French will get you dirty looks while the lazier option of speaking English will spark conversations with multilingual locals. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong></p> <p> Start at the Markt square early in the morning when the cobbles are being scrubbed and street vendors trim the seams of waffles with nail scissors. </p> <p>To get your bearings, climb the Belfort, an 84m-high, 13th-century belfry which, for Bfr100 (\u00a31.55), provides a view over the city to the sea. </p> <p>A two-minute walk away is the Burg, the centre of medieval Bruges which hosts nine centuries of different architectural styles. A short stroll south takes you to the antique and flea markets perched on the bank of the Dijver canal, in front of a cluster of art galleries. </p> <p>The Groeninge museum (Bfr200) has an impressive collection of early Flemish masters such as Jan van Eyck and Hans Memling. It also houses major works by Bosch and Belgian surrealists Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Paul Delvaux. </p> <p>Continue south down Mariastraat to the banks of the Minnewater (Lake of Love) and the Begijnhof community. These white-washed houses were once home to the beguines, a lay sisterhood who lived and dressed as nuns but who did not take vows so they could return at will to their lovers in the secular world. </p> <p>In the early evening, walk north from Jan Van Eyckplein, along the quiet canalside Potterierei into the residential side of Bruges for quiet caf\u00e9s. </p> <p><strong> Guided tours</strong></p> <p> Guided tours are one of Bruges's biggest industries but choose carefully. </p> <p>A walking tour of the centre (between Bfr150 and 1,500) won't tell you any more than a guidebook. </p> <p>A boat tour along the canals with a driver barking down a megaphone seems conspicuous - locals don't use the canals - but it is the best way to get a view of the medieval architecture. Tickets cost Bfr190 and boats depart from the Djiver every 10 minutes. Queues are long, so go last thing in the evening when the city empties out. </p> <p>A 35-minute horse-and-trap ride round the city centre costs Bfr1,000 for four and leaves from the Burg. Drivers talk mostly about their horses. Book at the tourist office (+50 44 86 86) to avoid queues. </p> <p>For Bfr650, you can take a mountain-bike tour with an English guide through the villages surrounding Bruges. Contact the Back Road Bike company (+50 37 04 70). </p> <p><strong> Where to drink</strong></p> <p> The three best local beers are Brugse Tarwebier, a pale wheat beer drunk with a slice of lemon, brewed at De Gouden Boom in Langestraat; Straffe Hendrik brewed at Walplein, 26; and the stronger Brugse Tripel. But there are more than 400 brews in Bruges. You can sample them all at the breweries, along with a throng of other tourists, but it's better to head for a quiet caf\u00e9 near a canal. Walk east up Hoogstraat for the best beer gardens. </p> <p>Bars start to fill up around 11pm. The yuppies congregate on Vlamingstraat. The hip crowd heads north up Kuipersstraat after 11pm, or south to the T'Zand. </p> <p>To find out what's happening on the alternative scene, check notices in the windows of the record shops on Hoogstraat. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat</strong> </p> <p> On a hot day, buy a picnic from one of the delicatessens on Vlamingstraat or Adrian Willaerstraat. If you are vegetarian, try the macrobiotic deli at Katelijnestraat, 140. Pick up some chocolate pralines from the highly-kitsch De Clerk chocolaterie on Academiestraat, 19. Then head for the lawns of Minnewater or Kor Astridpark. </p> <p>Most restaurants in or around the Markt are touristy and overpriced. Instead, head into the back streets and small squares. For Flemish-style mussels with spinach or Bruges-style boiled eel, try Poules Moules in Simon Stevinplein, where dinner for two with wine costs around \u00a330. The best bouillabaisse is at Cafedraal brasserie on Zilverstraat, 38, but book early (+50 34 08 45). Vegetarians should head for Biosfeer organic restaurant, tucked away at Acadmiestraat, 15 or the T'Brugsch pancake house at Helmstraat, 3. </p> <p>For the freshest waffles, sit outside the Grand Caf\u00e9 Belfort, Markt, 25, or buy them from street vendors for around \u00a31. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong></p> <p> Bruges has more than 100 hotels and B&amp;Bs. But they tend to be overbooked in the high season, which starts at Easter and lasts until November. Book early or go for last minute deals at <a href=\"http://www.belgiantravel.co.uk\">www.belgiantravel.co.uk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.europeanlife.co.uk\">www.europeanlife.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>At the glamourous end of the market is the Hotel De Orangerie perched on a beautiful canal bank in the centre of town. Double rooms start at Bfr6,950. There is a vast selection of mid-range hotels.

      "bodyText": "Bruges is an eccentric mix of darkness and beauty. The beauty comes from 100km of winding canals lined with gabled houses. Darkness is in the works of its artists, the Flemish Primitives, who specialised in giant paintings of disembowelment; and Heironymous Bosch's scenes of bizarre horror in its galleries. From the 12th to the 15th centuries, Bruges was the financial hub of Europe, the site of the world's first stock exchange and the centre of the diamond and lace trades. Then darkness descended when the waterway that linked it to the sea began to silt up; merchants and traders left, and the city slept for 400 years. In the late 19th century, the author Georges Rodenbach wrote a novel set in the city's abandoned streets, called Bruges the Dead, and the Belgian elite started to return Because Bruges was never redeveloped, it is now the best-preserved medieval city in western Europe. There are no billboards, no high rises, few neon signs and traffic is regulated. You can walk for three hours without leaving cobbled streets. The only sound is clarion bells and the clatter of horse-drawn carriages. Four hours from London by train, it makes for a convenient city break. More than two million visitors a year come to see its art and architecture, taste its beers and visit its antiques markets; in 2002, Bruges will be European city of culture. But away from the centre and within walking distance of the main attractions, there's another side to the city in the basement jazz clubs, karaoke bars, design shops and organic restaurants. The city is compact, so the main sights and the underground scene are within walkingdistance of each other. There are also lush, canal-side lawns, where you can enjoy a picnic and watch the world go by - in Bruges' case an odd mix of artists, Benedictine nuns and yuppies who do the hour's commute to Brussels each morning. And, because the city falls on the Flemish side of Belgium's linguistic divide, ordering in French will get you dirty looks while the lazier option of speaking English will spark conversations with multilingual locals. What to see Start at the Markt square early in the morning when the cobbles are being scrubbed and street vendors trim the seams of waffles with nail scissors. To get your bearings, climb the Belfort, an 84m-high, 13th-century belfry which, for Bfr100 (\u00a31.55), provides a view over the city to the sea. A two-minute walk away is the Burg, the centre of medieval Bruges which hosts nine centuries of different architectural styles. A short stroll south takes you to the antique and flea markets perched on the bank of the Dijver canal, in front of a cluster of art galleries. The Groeninge museum (Bfr200) has an impressive collection of early Flemish masters such as Jan van Eyck and Hans Memling. It also houses major works by Bosch and Belgian surrealists Ren\u00e9 Magritte and Paul Delvaux. Continue south down Mariastraat to the banks of the Minnewater (Lake of Love) and the Begijnhof community. These white-washed houses were once home to the beguines, a lay sisterhood who lived and dressed as nuns but who did not take vows so they could return at will to their lovers in the secular world. In the early evening, walk north from Jan Van Eyckplein, along the quiet canalside Potterierei into the residential side of Bruges for quiet caf\u00e9s. Guided tours Guided tours are one of Bruges's biggest industries but choose carefully. A walking tour of the centre (between Bfr150 and 1,500) won't tell you any more than a guidebook. A boat tour along the canals with a driver barking down a megaphone seems conspicuous - locals don't use the canals - but it is the best way to get a view of the medieval architecture. Tickets cost Bfr190 and boats depart from the Djiver every 10 minutes. Queues are long, so go last thing in the evening when the city empties out. A 35-minute horse-and-trap ride round the city centre costs Bfr1,000 for four and leaves from the Burg. Drivers talk mostly about their horses. Book at the tourist office (+50 44 86 86) to avoid queues. For Bfr650, you can take a mountain-bike tour with an English guide through the villages surrounding Bruges. Contact the Back Road Bike company (+50 37 04 70). Where to drink The three best local beers are Brugse Tarwebier, a pale wheat beer drunk with a slice of lemon, brewed at De Gouden Boom in Langestraat; Straffe Hendrik brewed at Walplein, 26; and the stronger Brugse Tripel. But there are more than 400 brews in Bruges. You can sample them all at the breweries, along with a throng of other tourists, but it's better to head for a quiet caf\u00e9 near a canal. Walk east up Hoogstraat for the best beer gardens. Bars start to fill up around 11pm. The yuppies congregate on Vlamingstraat. The hip crowd heads north up Kuipersstraat after 11pm, or south to the T'Zand. To find out what's happening on the alternative scene, check notices in the windows of the record shops on Hoogstraat. Where to eat On a hot day, buy a picnic from one of the delicatessens on Vlamingstraat or Adrian Willaerstraat. If you are vegetarian, try the macrobiotic deli at Katelijnestraat, 140. Pick up some chocolate pralines from the highly-kitsch De Clerk chocolaterie on Academiestraat, 19. Then head for the lawns of Minnewater or Kor Astridpark. Most restaurants in or around the Markt are touristy and overpriced. Instead, head into the back streets and small squares. For Flemish-style mussels with spinach or Bruges-style boiled eel, try Poules Moules in Simon Stevinplein, where dinner for two with wine costs around \u00a330. The best bouillabaisse is at Cafedraal brasserie on Zilverstraat, 38, but book early (+50 34 08 45). Vegetarians should head for Biosfeer organic restaurant, tucked away at Acadmiestraat, 15 or the T'Brugsch pancake house at Helmstraat, 3. For the freshest waffles, sit outside the Grand Caf\u00e9 Belfort, Markt, 25, or buy them from street vendors for around \u00a31. Where to stay Bruges has more than 100 hotels and B&amp;Bs. But they tend to be overbooked in the high season, which starts at Easter and lasts until November. Book early or go for last minute deals at www.belgiantravel.co.uk or www.europeanlife.co.uk. At the glamourous end of the market is the Hotel De Orangerie perched on a beautiful canal bank in the centre of town. Double rooms start at Bfr6,950. There is a vast selection of mid-range hotels. One of the best is the Hotel Aragon, tucked in a quiet, winding street to the north of the city centre. Another option is a holiday flat. New companies letting attic studios and modern apartments are springing up every month. Check the tourist information office for details (+50 44 86 86). Best bars in Bruges Cafedraal Zilverstraat, 38 A medieval cottage hidden behind a walled garden. The Bohemian crowd bump their heads on hams dangling from the ceiling. Vourmolen Vlamingstraat, 13 Local crowd spill on to pavement terraces to the sound of Flemish remixes. De Garre Garre, 1 Traditional beer house. De Versteende Nacht Langestraat, 11 Caf\u00e9 run by Fats Waller fans. Live jazz and jam sessions. Cactus Caf\u00e9 St Jakobstraat, 36a Silly name but extensive beer list and nice patio.

      "body": "<p>Skiddaw is often crowded with walkers on the easy ascent from Keswick. But this doesn't deter Lord Bragg, who comes at it from the desolate north and rarely sees a soul before the summit. </p> <p>It's a favourite walk of his, starting from his cottage on the northern rim of the Lake District, eight miles from where he was born. Like Scafell Pike via Piers Gill or Helvellyn via Nethermost Cove, it shows the unusual side of a familiar mountain. </p> <p>\"Skiddaw's a grand old fell,\" he says. \"It's underestimated because it's overused. But there's a way to wander up Skiddaw that remains deeply attractive.\" </p> <p>The route takes him at first through the grounds of a large house, which burnt down in 1958: \"There are still traces of its grandeur - water gardens and pathways through the woods, and there the kind of feeling you get in LP Hartley of 'once there was, and now he's gone'. It's a nice, melancholy start.\" </p> <p>Cutting across the fields, he passes a little-known curiosity - a sandstone pillar with the carved head of the great huntsman John Peel, whose grave is not far away - \"a kind of cross between the Lake District and Easter Island: very odd.\" </p> <p>An ancient drovers' road, layered into the hillside, gives some fast walking before he heads for Dash Falls. </p> <p>\"I like the waterfall - it's so gloomy, doesn't seem to get any sun at all. It could be one of those terrible dells where the fifth most important character in a novel drowns himself or herself. The long valley at the top has that desolate feeling I particularly enjoy.\" </p> <p>This brings him to a height of 1,500ft and a clump of trees sheltering a desolate former shooting lodge called Skiddaw House, now a youth hostel. From there, it's about an hour's steady climbing to the top across a pathless grassy hump called Sale How. </p> <p>If it's a clear day, the reward at the summit is the sudden view of Keswick clustered round the head of DerwentWater and, beyond it to the south, the full vista of the lakeland mountains. There's also a stone shelter and - as likely as not - clusters of other walkers. </p> <p>\"The last time I was up there was with my son Tom; we spent about 10 minutes watching a hawk, only about 10 or 15 feet from the ground, in a very high wind. We were sitting against the cairn getting battered, and it was perfectly steady, seeming to enjoy the wind hitting it. It was very, very good.\" </p> <p>The descent towards Keswick, with the lake growing from the size of a handkerchief, is the highlight of the walk for Bragg, full of memories of school trips and family outings: \"It's a mixture of landscape and history and literature and personal history. It has lots of layers for me. </p> <p>\"Then it's into Keswick, through the park, and into the pub. It's about six hours of walking - a good day whatever the weather - and, because you're going over a mountain and into a town, there's a feeling of arrival, a feeling of going from nowhere into somewhere. </p> <p>\"And I just feel better for it. I wouldn't like to make any great claims that some people do about walking - most spectacularly, Wordsworth. He did walk his poems, didn't he? Composed them while walking, with a walking metre in his verse, if you like. </p> <p>\"And I know quite a few writers who swear by walking as an aid to composition. It doesn't happen as neatly as that for me. I just feel six or seven hours out in that sort of empty place is something I'm very lucky to have. I'd even go as far as saying I need it, although that seems to be rather overprivileged.\"</p> <p><strong>'They know not Skiddaw who have climbed it only from Keswick!\"</strong></p> <p> So says Alfred Wainwright, the late guru of Lake District fanatics, in the 28 handwritten, densely-illustrated pages which he devotes to the mountain in his 1962 guide, The Northern Fells. </p> <p>\"It is an easy climb, yes; its slopes are smooth and grassy, yes; it has no frightful precipices, no rugged outcrops, agreed; it offer nothing of interest or entertainment to rock-gymnasts, agreed. But are they not quite minor failings? Are they failings at all?</p> <p>\"The summit is buttressed magnificently by a circle of lesser heights, all of the members of the proud Skiddaw family, the whole forming a splendid and complete example of the structure of mountains, especially well seen from all directions because of its isolation.</p> <p>\"Its lines are smooth, its curves graceful; but because the slopes are steep everywhere, the quick build-up of the massif from valley levels to central summit is appreciated at a glance.

      "bodyText": "Skiddaw is often crowded with walkers on the easy ascent from Keswick. But this doesn't deter Lord Bragg, who comes at it from the desolate north and rarely sees a soul before the summit. It's a favourite walk of his, starting from his cottage on the northern rim of the Lake District, eight miles from where he was born. Like Scafell Pike via Piers Gill or Helvellyn via Nethermost Cove, it shows the unusual side of a familiar mountain. \"Skiddaw's a grand old fell,\" he says. \"It's underestimated because it's overused. But there's a way to wander up Skiddaw that remains deeply attractive.\" The route takes him at first through the grounds of a large house, which burnt down in 1958: \"There are still traces of its grandeur - water gardens and pathways through the woods, and there the kind of feeling you get in LP Hartley of 'once there was, and now he's gone'. It's a nice, melancholy start.\" Cutting across the fields, he passes a little-known curiosity - a sandstone pillar with the carved head of the great huntsman John Peel, whose grave is not far away - \"a kind of cross between the Lake District and Easter Island: very odd.\" An ancient drovers' road, layered into the hillside, gives some fast walking before he heads for Dash Falls. \"I like the waterfall - it's so gloomy, doesn't seem to get any sun at all. It could be one of those terrible dells where the fifth most important character in a novel drowns himself or herself. The long valley at the top has that desolate feeling I particularly enjoy.\" This brings him to a height of 1,500ft and a clump of trees sheltering a desolate former shooting lodge called Skiddaw House, now a youth hostel. From there, it's about an hour's steady climbing to the top across a pathless grassy hump called Sale How. If it's a clear day, the reward at the summit is the sudden view of Keswick clustered round the head of DerwentWater and, beyond it to the south, the full vista of the lakeland mountains. There's also a stone shelter and - as likely as not - clusters of other walkers. \"The last time I was up there was with my son Tom; we spent about 10 minutes watching a hawk, only about 10 or 15 feet from the ground, in a very high wind. We were sitting against the cairn getting battered, and it was perfectly steady, seeming to enjoy the wind hitting it. It was very, very good.\" The descent towards Keswick, with the lake growing from the size of a handkerchief, is the highlight of the walk for Bragg, full of memories of school trips and family outings: \"It's a mixture of landscape and history and literature and personal history. It has lots of layers for me. \"Then it's into Keswick, through the park, and into the pub. It's about six hours of walking - a good day whatever the weather - and, because you're going over a mountain and into a town, there's a feeling of arrival, a feeling of going from nowhere into somewhere. \"And I just feel better for it. I wouldn't like to make any great claims that some people do about walking - most spectacularly, Wordsworth. He did walk his poems, didn't he? Composed them while walking, with a walking metre in his verse, if you like. \"And I know quite a few writers who swear by walking as an aid to composition. It doesn't happen as neatly as that for me. I just feel six or seven hours out in that sort of empty place is something I'm very lucky to have. I'd even go as far as saying I need it, although that seems to be rather overprivileged.\" 'They know not Skiddaw who have climbed it only from Keswick!\" So says Alfred Wainwright, the late guru of Lake District fanatics, in the 28 handwritten, densely-illustrated pages which he devotes to the mountain in his 1962 guide, The Northern Fells. \"It is an easy climb, yes; its slopes are smooth and grassy, yes; it has no frightful precipices, no rugged outcrops, agreed; it offer nothing of interest or entertainment to rock-gymnasts, agreed. But are they not quite minor failings? Are they failings at all? \"The summit is buttressed magnificently by a circle of lesser heights, all of the members of the proud Skiddaw family, the whole forming a splendid and complete example of the structure of mountains, especially well seen from all directions because of its isolation. \"Its lines are smooth, its curves graceful; but because the slopes are steep everywhere, the quick build-up of the massif from valley levels to central summit is appreciated at a glance. This, then is Skiddaw, a giant in stature. But an affable and friendly giant.\" The practicals The best rail stations for the northern Lake District are Penrith, Carlisle and Wigton: national rail enquiries 0345 484950.

A patient explains his problem to a psychiatrist: \" 'I have come to consult you,' he said, 'because I have no peace of mind. Twenty-five years ago I sold my soul to the Devil.' \"</p> <p>By page three we learn that the patient has arrived at the offices of Dr Hildegard Wolf on the recommendation of a friend, a troubled priest, who gives him this insight into her methods: \" 'She advised me not to try to pray. She advised me to shut up and listen. Read the gospel, she said. Jesus is praying to you for sympathy. You have to see his point of view, what he had to put up with. Listen, don't talk. Read the Bible. Take it in. God is talking, not you.' \"</p> <p>This may sound like an unconventional therapeutic tack, but Dr Wolf, whose skill has been \"perfected by herself\", is not simply iconoclastic; she is also a charlatan. She is her own creation - she has changed her identity, shedding a previous life in which she was Beate Pappenheim, the famous stigmatic of Munich - and a fake. Now, she sits in a sumptuous suite on the Boulevard St Germain, charging her clients $1,500 for sessions that last three-quarters of an hour, effecting a talking cure that consists mainly of her own idle chatter about her carefully crafted life. </p> <p>Hildegard is another of Spark's diabolical characters, the latest in a long line that includes the monstrous Jean Brodie and the Abbess of Crewe, whose penchant for surveillance enabled Spark to mount an effective satire on Watergate. Fuelled by their belief in a particular destiny - their own - these maniacal manipulators elevate themselves to positions beyond law, ethics, morality - in fact, as the Abbess herself notes, to the realm of mythology, where action and charisma count for all. But if Aiding and Abetting has a theme, it is that sympathy is both relative and unpredictable: in other words, when monsters are cornered, their charisma begins to work overtime and we may not find ourselves invulnerable to their charms. </p> <p>Hildegard's Faustian patient tells her that he is Lord Lucan. She has become used to such grandiose claims: when her new charge strolls into her consulting room, she already has a disturbed Lord Lucan on her books. And the dilemma of which man, if either, to believe, and whether she should be treating guilt or delusion, or both, becomes secondary the minute one of them threatens to place a call to Interpol and acquaint them with the whereabouts of the vanished stigmatic. As the novel unfolds, the psychiatrist herself becomes the quarry, with the two would-be Earls circling menacingly around her, themselves startled by a fresh threat of capture.</p> <p>Spark's economical, elliptical prose is alive with understated comedy: one has the sense that her talent for farce is constantly held in check by the seriousness of her ideas. One of the Lucan-chasers, an old gaming pal named Joe stirred into belated curiosity by his attraction to a young woman trying to write a Lucan book, ponders the persistent allure of the case, and decides that \"the disappearance of Lucan partakes of the realistic-surrealistic\", a description that could equally well apply to this novel, whose byways are vivid with malice and deliciously subtle spite. </p> <p>In the novel's realistic strand - if one can term \"realistic\" an invented present for one of the world's most notorious escapees - Spark concerns herself not simply with the psychological truths that might underwrite Lucan's botched attempt to murder his wife (a brutal attack that left the couple's nanny with her head caved in in a Belgravia basement), but with the motives that inspired his friends and confidants - his aiders and abetters - to spirit him away beyond the reach of the law. He was, by several accounts, a dullard, an obsessional gambler, a sexual sadist, a ruthless man whose social charms barely concealed his fecklessness. \"He beat his wife with a cane,\" notes Hildegard. \"Very sick, that.\" </p> <p>But, like Dr Wolf and Jean Brodie before her, Lucan was also a determined and consummate actor, as Joe points out: \"There was a kind of psychological paralysis, almost an unconscious conspiracy to let him get away. It was not only that he was a member of the aristocracy, a prominent upper-class fellow, it was that he had pitched his life and all his living arrangements to that proposition. His proposition was: I am a seventh Earl, I am an aristocrat, therefore I can do what I like, I am untouchable.\" </p> <p>As she skilfully evokes the vanishing world of the nobly born - endless games of baccarat and poker, the Clermont Club, the races - Spark invests it with its own moral atmosphere. Reflecting on the delayed advent of conscience among Lucan's protectors, Joe notes that \"since Lucan's day, snobs have been greatly marginalized\", suggesting that few of them would now be able to afford the luxury of funding a ne'er-do-well's furtive travels around the globe. </p> <p>And not simply one ne'er-do-well, but two. As the man we are more inclined to believe in as Lucan starts to display real psychological distress - the effect, he reckons, of being declared legally dead by his wife - the more we come to view his doppelg\u00e4nger as the true source of evil in the novel. His persecution of both \"Lucky\" and Hildegard is low-grade, trashy; by comparison, they are class acts. Suddenly, we find ourselves in sympathy with a murderer and a fraudster. </p> <p>There are flaws in this ambitious, rewardingly complex novel. A recurrent motif of blood, for example, links Hildegard, or Beate, who covered herself with her menstrual blood to fake the five wounds that made her famous, and Lucan, whose memories of murder are fraught with the excessive and unstaunchable flow that issued from the head of his nanny. \"Once it gets going, there is no stopping blood,\" Hildegard muses, but by the time its religious connotations are also suggested by the lamb chops that Lucan is fond of eating, it is a decidedly overworked metaphor. The fantastical African ending is distinctly sub-Waugh, and speaks of a surprising lack of authorial control. </p> <p>But these quibbles should not detract from the enjoyment of this exceptionally intelligent book. It is hard to think of another writer who could devise such a brashly absurd plot and then execute it with both flair and gravity. Spark has always had the facility to be silkily suave as she goes about examining our predilection for worshipping false gods. In Aiding and Abetting, it is the nature of charm that attracts her unflinching eye, and that proves itself to be very much in the eye of the beholder.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the past few months the ITV network has gone from being managed by three companies to two and from a triumvirate of media barons to just Michael Green of Carlton and Charles Allen of Granada. That, at least, would be the impression of anyone reading the business pages of the national press. That would be right if there was not the small matter of the existence of Scotland. </p> <p>Andrew Flanagan, chief executive of SMG, the former Scottish Media Group, is the ITV tycoon that the Times (and everyone else) forgot. </p> <p>The quietly spoken Glaswegian is at the helm of the company which owns the Scottish Television and Grampian ITV franchises as well as newspapers including the influential Herald and Evening News. </p> <p>He was also the man who made TV and radio presenter Chris Evans a very rich man earlier this year when he agreed to pay \u00a3225m for Ginger Media Group, including Virgin Radio and the production business behind TFI Friday. </p> <p>If Flanagan occupied the same position in England as he does at home he would be considered one of the most powerful media moguls in Britain. </p> <p>Flanagan, 44, claims not to be rattled by the attention given to his better known rivals and gets on with them despite their \"strong views and high self regard\". </p> <p>But if he does not seek the personal limelight then he does bristle over the lack of attention given to SMG. He recalls with some exasperation a conversation with a London advertising executive after the group last year acquired Pearl &amp; Dean, the cinema advertising sales business, for \u00a325m. </p> <p>\"The media sector and the advertising community is very Londoncentric,\" he says. \"It was startling that when we bought Pearl &amp; Dean, which in the round was a pretty small deal, the impact in London was huge. People were saying 'great deal. You've really arrived'. They even started singing the tune down the phone.\" </p> <p>The Pearl &amp; Dean acquisition was a plank in SMG's nascent strategy to take on England's media community in its own backyard. </p> <p>The change of name for the company to veil its roots was a reflection of the growing percentage of business it is now doing outside Scotland. </p> <p>The business has grown in value fourfold in the past five years from a position where it was a single ITV franchise, Scottish Television. In 1996, Herald publisher Caledonian was bought, a year later Grampian was added followed by Pearl &amp; Dean, outdoor poster group Primesight, a larger slice of GMTV and Ginger. </p> <p>\"Scotland is a great place but too many Scottish companies fall into the trap of thinking we have a nice life, we are profitable, people leave us alone - and then lo and behold they are taken over. You have to keep moving. </p> <p>\"When I joined it was at the first round of consolidation in 1994 and people said why bother you'll be taken over within five weeks. If you keep focused on your own strategy and keep running fast then it is difficult for a predator.\" </p> <p>The determination to keep deal-making was underlined last week when the group raised a further \u00a345m from a share placing to give it the flexibility to pounce when opportunities arise. </p> <p>The Ginger deal was the largest so far and if Pearl &amp; Dean caught Londoners' attention then the notoriety of Chris Evans was a smack in the face. </p> <p>As well as the national radio licence it made SMG the sixth largest TV programme maker in Britain, building on its own productions including detective series Taggart and game show Wheel of Fortune. </p> <p>TFI Friday is now in its last season but Channel 4 has commissioned Evans to come up with a replacement vehicle. Ginger production the Priory, meanwhile, has been recommissioned and the company is working on its first feature film with Sky. </p> <p><strong> Ginger whingers</strong><br> </p> <p> The Ginger deal drew fierce criticism from, among others, SMG's largest shareholder, Granada. Flanagan says much of the criticism stemmed from a lack of understanding of the Ginger business. \"People thought we were paying \u00a3225m for a TV presenter but we weren't. We were paying for a business with good fundamentals.\" </p> <p>Evans is locked in for a number of years but, Flanagan notes, the value of the business would not collapse without him. \"When he left Radio 1, they replaced him with Zoe Ball and listening figures didn't fall.\" </p> <p>He also says the brickbats stemmed from a resentment that Evans should personally make \u00a375m from the takeover. \"There was the feeling that it was somehow unfair that Evans should make all that money. But he made a good decision to invest when he did and he got a fair return.\" </p> <p>There are, he says, three Evans. The TV and radio personality, the off-duty lad who plays up to the excess image and the serious, level-headed man with a shrewd eye for an investment. \"The latter is probably closest to the real Chris Evans,\" he says. </p> <p>While the aim is to expand the group's horizons, the ingrained attitudes of advertisers who disfavour Scotland still grate. \"Scotland's economics are on a par with the UK average and disposable in come is quite high because accommodation and travel costs are lower. But in ITV terms we get 10% of viewer share and only 6% of advertising by value. Why is a viewer in Norwich worth more than a viewer in Edinburgh? It's ridiculous,\" he says. </p> <p>\"The Herald outsells all the English broadsheets put together in Scotland but Scottish papers get only 2% of national display advertising. Why is that the case? </p> <p>\"People in advertising think they've got national coverage if they use the English papers and that's not true. But the decision is made in London.\" </p> <p>If Scotland were a separate country then multinational advertisers, such as Unilever or Ford, would assign it an individual marketing budget instead of leaving spending decisions in the hands of the Soho crowd, he points out - although he is on record as being ambivalent about a fully independent Scotland. </p> <p>\"It's not that I find it patronising. It's just a situation that exists,\" he says before launching into another commentary which suggests he does not feel the equanimity he would like to suggest. </p> <p>\"You do sometimes feel miffed. People in London think Capital Radio is the number one station but north of Birmingham no one has heard of it. Virgin is a national brand but there again is this Londoncentric mentality.\" </p> <p>Flanagan was born in the east end of Glasgow into what he describes as a \"modest but very stable\" environment. His father was a traffic controller for British Rail and his mother worked as a book keeper. </p> <p>After attending the local school and university - \"a very traditional west Scotland thing to do\" - he decided to see the world. </p> <p>Not for Flanagan, though, the haze of late 1970s Goa or bumming around in Australia but the prudent option of Brussels - where he worked for seven years as a management consultant. </p> <p>Flanagan is part of the new breed of media tycoon less interested in trophy assets than he is in running businesses. </p> <p>After working with a series of compa nies in computing and telecoms he switched over to work in-house for some of his clients - a walking advertisement for the convergence of IT, telecoms and media before anyone ever thought of it. He did stints at ITT and cable operator Nynex before being lured back to Scottish TV as finance director in 1994. </p> <p>He says he had never intended to end up back in Glasgow and assumed his career would continue in London. He is critical of another Scottish national working in the media and living in the capital for losing touch with the feelings of the Scottish population - Andrew Neil. </p> <p>Flanagan scoffs at Neil's stewardship of Herald rival, the Edinburgh-based Scotsman. </p> <p>\"The Scotsman is a fantastic brand but Andrew Neil has alienated the readership because his views are quite right wing and very unionist in the context of a Scotland which is slightly left of centre and which is going through devolution which some 70% of people voted for. His views jar and the paper has lost its position. </p> <p>\"It's fine having strident views but at the same time you have to be in tune with your readership. That is why they began price cutting, which is hugely expensive and has had hardly any impact on our circulation. </p> <p>\"They are selling at 20p, the Herald is at 48p and we have lost maybe 3,000.\" </p> <p>The group's latest publishing venture is the Sunday Herald, which has established a circulation of 55,000, putting it behind only Scotland on Sunday and the Scottish edition of the Sunday Times. </p> <p><strong> At arm's length</strong><br> </p> <p> A sense of detachment from the London-based media fraternity is a common theme. Even the appeal of Big Brother has passed him by. </p> <p>\"Maybe it's that I find that kind of voyeurism a little disconcerting but I also have no empathy with any of the people because I would never have put myself through that kind of situation.\" </p> <p>He shrugs off any hint of inevitability that SMG or at least its ITV assets will be subsumed into a single ITV company controlled by either Granada or Carlton. </p> <p>\"Scotland and Northern Ireland [which is served by the still independent Ulster Television] sit slightly apart. People in Scotland don't talk about ITV, but about Grampian and Scottish - so we pretty much sit at arm's length. </p> <p>\"The reality is that when people are talking about a single ITV they are talking about England and I don't think it is at all inevitable that we will end up as part of that - although it is possible.\"</p>",

But I could not agree with you less. Yes, many women are happy to devote themselves to their families. But so are many men; they are denied the opportunity to do so. I am not arguing that bringing up children is an unimportant job. I am arguing that it is too important for just one parent.</p> <p>Women are not naturally better at looking after children than men \u0096 they just do more of it. Given the chance, men acquire childcare skills as quickly as women. It is true that today most people support a fairly traditional division of labour. But attitudes change.

But every move to give workers more time off \u0096 from shorter working days to maternity leave \u0096 has been seen as a threat to profits. Capitalism seems to have survived. Even if there is a cost, this is far outweighed by the benefits to men, children and, most of all, to women. <br>Yours,<br> Richard</p> <p><b>Dear Richard</b><br> Many fathers are devoted to their families. But the survey I quoted, by psychology professor Charlie Lewis, stated that most fathers see their main duty as bringing in money while mothers look after their children. This is particularly the case when the child is very young. This would suggest that the take-up rate for men for paternity leave over the first months of a child\u0092s life would be low.</p> <p>I do not believe that men have the same instinctive parenting skills as women. There are exceptions to every generalisation. But exceptions do not overturn the basic differences between men and women in the reproductive process. This may be regarded as hopelessly reactionary, but to deny it is to deny the essence of what distinguishes men from women. I am not as sanguine about the impact on businesses as you are concerning yet more regulations. The current government has, for its own social engineering agenda, introduced extra employment regulations that serious problems. Even though I speculate that the take-up for paternity leave would be low, I stick to the view that such leave could prove devastating for small businesses already being strangled in red tape. <br>Yours,<br> Ruth</p> <p><b>Dear Ruth,</b><br> Your two arguments contradict each other. If men are not interested in childcare, and so will not take up paid paternity leave, how will it be devastating for business? </p> <p>Men are rethinking their role as fathers \u0096 young men rank loving your child and being responsible ahead of breadwinning. Nor do women have instinctively better parenting skills than men \u0096 that is simply a stereotype underpinned by law. I agree that we are a long way, as a society, from seeing this. But in a few decades time your view will seem as outdated as the one that women aren\u0092t really up to the rigours of paid labour. The only significant biological difference is that women can breastfeed \u0096 and I imagine most couples would use the mother\u0092s leave in the first months, with the father taking over if she returns to work. The need for childcare does not end with the need for breast milk.</p> <p>My proposals to give men the same rights as women are about choice. If men don\u0092t want to take time off, so be it.

If many men did take the leave, the difficulties for businesses would be significant and could then stimulate the backlash by the childless against parents. You talk of extending choice. But your proposals are only for the parents of young children.</p> <p>I am not surprised to see young men rank loving their children ahead of breadwinning. But this doesn\u0092t mean they wish to do the nurturing. Your points that women do not have better parenting instincts than men and that the only biological difference is that women breastfeed, left me gasping.

So, imagine how I felt in Cambridge last week when I learned that the nameless chef, whose lunchtime cooking I had just enjoyed, was emigrating to Spain in three days. I was so cross that I kicked a lamp-post until my toe hurt. </p> <p>In which case, why should I bother to carry on with this review, you may well ask. Well, after a long conversation with the management, I was convinced that, while the chef may change, the style of the place and its food will remain much the same, which is individual to say the least. Beyond that, in a city of a thousand Cafe Flos, Garfunkels, All Bar Ones, Cafe Rouges, etc etc etc, Venue strikes a cheerfully individual note. In that, it is not quite alone - Restaurant Twenty-Two and Midsummer House keep the independents' flag flying in Cambridge - but those two are justly celebrated in guides. Venue is not yet and, in answer to a purposeful recommendation from a reader, it was to Venue that I went. </p> <p>If I had not bothered, the charming young woman who looked after me and the manager could have packed up for the day and gone sun-bathing. I shared the 50s-kitsch dining room with one other lunchtimer. All too soon, he had munched and gone, leaving me to the Arne Jacobsen chairs, the cream walls broken here and there by flat planes of candy-floss pink, ice-lolly orange and odd, larger-than-life-sized, Heath-esque cut-out cartoon figures; and the charming rope of white lightbulbs hung like a string of giant pearls over metal balustrading at the far end of the room. A piano and microphone made up the slightly surreal arrangements for the room. There was no canned music, just the ghost of jazz evenings past. </p> <p>This may all sound awful to you, but it isn't. It has a gawky charm and distinct personality, qualities that we don't find as frequently as we should these days, when everything is calibrated by corporate design strategy or cloned from one or two originals. Added to which, you can have two courses of big-tasting, individually prepared, properly cooked food for \u00a39.50 - no more than you would end up paying for conveyor-belt dishes of dubious parentage at any number of ersatz Continental-style chains. </p> <p>I did not choose from the lunchtime set menu, tempted though I was by smoked salmon soup and grilled chicken fillet with lemon, rosemary, salad and potatoes. I decided that a terrine of spiced sardines and thyme with saffron, tomato and lemon dressing followed by roasted chump of English lamb with carrot-and-sultana chutney and tzatziki suited my mood better.</p> <p>Mixing and matching of ingredients and cooking styles seems to hold universal sway these days, but whoever has the final say over the Venue menu has a pretty unusual touch. There were some really seriously considered vegetarian dishes for a start - chickpea mousseline frite with parsley-mint tabbouleh and creamed a\u00efoli, for example. And then there are the herbs and spices - thyme with the sardines; cinnamon, ginger and turmeric oil; minted hollandaise sauce; carrots in ginger oil; grated potato and horseradish to go alongside a smoked salmon and samphire salad - which add a distinctly idiosyncratic, not to say quirky, cast to the food. </p> <p>The terrine turned out to be a generous block of layers of mildly mashed sardines and slices of suitably waxy potatoes. It was expertly assembled and genuinely spiced. It would have benefited from having been out of the fridge for longer, as the chill killed off the thyme and damped down the other flavours, but this was an unusual and effective dish, all the more so because the dressing was first rate. </p> <p>At first glance, the main course may seem even more bizarre, but if you remember that Indians temper the heat of curries with yoghurt and that Armenians like to splash the stuff into their stews, the combination of English roasted lamb, Indian chutney and Greek salad is not so odd as it may first appear. It is also really rather good. The cause of the dish was helped by exceptionally fine lamb, generously flavoured, thickly sliced, nicely pink and properly seasoned.</p> <p> The \"chutney\" was more like shredded carrot with sultanas, gingered up with masala, but the spicy sweetness went cheerfully along with the meat, while the tzatziki added a cooling crunch. To these were added a bowl of spectacularly good slices of crisply saut\u00e9ed potatoes draped in a gently garlicky sauce. Killer stuff. </p> <p>A plum-and-almond tart brought things to a substantial conclusion, and a bill for \u00a343.20 - \u00a329.25 of which went on the food, and the rest on two glasses of wine, water and coffee. For serious headbangers, the William Hagues and Euan Blairs of this world, there's a bar upstairs, which has a generous sprinkling of cocktails around the \u00a33.50 mark. </p> <p>So that's Venue as it is now, and as it will remain - at least, until the new chef, whoever he or she may be, takes things into their own hands and starts making those changes that all chefs must make sooner or later, or else go mad.</p>",

All too soon, he had munched and gone, leaving me to the Arne Jacobsen chairs, the cream walls broken here and there by flat planes of candy-floss pink, ice-lolly orange and odd, larger-than-life-sized, Heath-esque cut-out cartoon figures; and the charming rope of white lightbulbs hung like a string of giant pearls over metal balustrading at the far end of the room. A piano and microphone made up the slightly surreal arrangements for the room. There was no canned music, just the ghost of jazz evenings past. This may all sound awful to you, but it isn't. It has a gawky charm and distinct personality, qualities that we don't find as frequently as we should these days, when everything is calibrated by corporate design strategy or cloned from one or two originals. Added to which, you can have two courses of big-tasting, individually prepared, properly cooked food for \u00a39.50 - no more than you would end up paying for conveyor-belt dishes of dubious parentage at any number of ersatz Continental-style chains. I did not choose from the lunchtime set menu, tempted though I was by smoked salmon soup and grilled chicken fillet with lemon, rosemary, salad and potatoes. I decided that a terrine of spiced sardines and thyme with saffron, tomato and lemon dressing followed by roasted chump of English lamb with carrot-and-sultana chutney and tzatziki suited my mood better. Mixing and matching of ingredients and cooking styles seems to hold universal sway these days, but whoever has the final say over the Venue menu has a pretty unusual touch. There were some really seriously considered vegetarian dishes for a start - chickpea mousseline frite with parsley-mint tabbouleh and creamed a\u00efoli, for example. And then there are the herbs and spices - thyme with the sardines; cinnamon, ginger and turmeric oil; minted hollandaise sauce; carrots in ginger oil; grated potato and horseradish to go alongside a smoked salmon and samphire salad - which add a distinctly idiosyncratic, not to say quirky, cast to the food. The terrine turned out to be a generous block of layers of mildly mashed sardines and slices of suitably waxy potatoes. It was expertly assembled and genuinely spiced. It would have benefited from having been out of the fridge for longer, as the chill killed off the thyme and damped down the other flavours, but this was an unusual and effective dish, all the more so because the dressing was first rate. At first glance, the main course may seem even more bizarre, but if you remember that Indians temper the heat of curries with yoghurt and that Armenians like to splash the stuff into their stews, the combination of English roasted lamb, Indian chutney and Greek salad is not so odd as it may first appear. It is also really rather good. The cause of the dish was helped by exceptionally fine lamb, generously flavoured, thickly sliced, nicely pink and properly seasoned. The \"chutney\" was more like shredded carrot with sultanas, gingered up with masala, but the spicy sweetness went cheerfully along with the meat, while the tzatziki added a cooling crunch. To these were added a bowl of spectacularly good slices of crisply saut\u00e9ed potatoes draped in a gently garlicky sauce. Killer stuff. A plum-and-almond tart brought things to a substantial conclusion, and a bill for \u00a343.20 - \u00a329.25 of which went on the food, and the rest on two glasses of wine, water and coffee. For serious headbangers, the William Hagues and Euan Blairs of this world, there's a bar upstairs, which has a generous sprinkling of cocktails around the \u00a33.50 mark. So that's Venue as it is now, and as it will remain - at least, until the new chef, whoever he or she may be, takes things into their own hands and starts making those changes that all chefs must make sooner or later, or else go mad.",

First published in 1932, it is a marvellous compendium of recipes, as important a repository of our culture as Cecil Sharp's collection of English folk tunes. Minnow tansies, saucer pies, roasted cygnets, fag pie and Mrs Comber's sauce... they are all here, with sources properly acknowledged and recipes that are models of brevity and point. A true marvel. </p> <p> <strong> River Cafe Cook Book Green, by Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers</strong><br> (\u00a330, Ebury Press)</p> <p> At the other end of the universe from Florence White's treasure trove, but curiously similar in the tone of the prose, signore Gray and Rogers deal with food matters with admirable crispness. The recipes are sharp and clear, working in direct contrast to the superlatively seductive photographs of Martin Gray. The anticipatory greed created by the images gives you the courage to attempt the recipes. The degree to which they work, however, will depend on the quality of the ingredients to which you have access. That is axiomatic of all cooking, and of Italian cooking in particular. At the River Cafe, they bring in the best and freshest stuff straight from source. Sadly, the equivalent ingredients at your friendly supermarket down the road won't deliver the same oomph. Minimum guff, maximum price. Still, you can feast in your mind and start saving to go to Italy itself (or the River Caf\u00e9). </p> <p> <strong> Scots Cooking, by Sue Lawrence</strong><br> (\u00a318.99, Headline) </p> <p> You suspect there is only one book in Scots cooking, and this is it - from Aberdeen rowies to white puddings, by way of ham and haddie, potted hough and raggy biscuits. There may not be much strength in depth to Scots cooking, but what there is is magnificent, rich, potent and profoundly comforting. The recipes are splendidly clear, the provenance and cause for each put forward with brisk clarity, along with many references to various aunts, uncles and other members of the Lawrence family, all of whom seem to have splendid, heart-warming greed in common. </p> <p> <strong> Soup Simply Sensational, by Matthew Drennan</strong><br> (\u00a316.95, Aquamarine) </p> <p> Simply silly title for a surprisingly good book. Some old recipes - avgolemono, gazpacho, ribollita; some new - roasted aubergine and courgette with tzatziki, summer herb with char-grilled radicchio, chicken and crab noodle with coriander omelette. None seems unduly complicated, and Drennan has an interesting take on turning traditional main courses into soups - viz Irish country soup, braised cabbage soup with beef and horseradish cream, soup of Toulouse sausage with borlotti beans and breadcrumbs, and roast vegetable medley with sun-dried tomato bread - but his tome is a little on the expensive side. </p> <p> <strong> A Kitchen In Burgundy, by Anne Willan</strong><br> (\u00a325, Cassell) </p> <p> A la Recherche du Temps Culinaires: this book is a personal memoir of the Chteau du Fay, which became the home of Anne Willan's family, and of rural Burgundy, where it is situated. While the prose is of the head-girl, no-nonsense variety, Langdon Clay's pictures reek of nostalgia for the kind of France and French food we would like to think we remember. The recipes seem amiable enough, but the pictures and the mood are the thing. One for dreams rather than the beastly realities of everyday life. </p> <p> <strong> A Wolf In The Kitchen, by Lindsey Bareham</strong><br> (Penguin, \u00a39.99) </p> <p> A late arrival, garlanded with pukkas from the generous Jamie Oliver. A compendium of Bareham's recipes from the Evening Standard. Sensible, accessible, eminently munchable. Not so much madcap inspiration, more (and more valuable for it) a warm and reliable friend in the kitchen. How she manages to keep up the enthusiasm, productivity and, er, standards beats me, but she does, and thousands of daily domestic kitchens are the happier for her. </p> <p><strong> American red bean soup with guacamole salsa</strong></p> <p> From Soup Simply Sensational, pictured left.

Cook for four to five minutes, until softened. Add the cumin, cayenne and paprika, and cook for a minute, stirring continuously. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e, cook for a few seconds, then stir in the oregano. Add the chopped tomatoes, kidney beans and water. </p> <p>Bring to the boil then simmer for 15-20 minutes. Cool the soup slightly, then pur\u00e9e it in a food processor or blender until smooth.

Place in a bowl and mix in the red onion, chilli, coriander and lime juice. </p> <p>Reheat the soup and ladle into bowls.

Cover a board with a mixture of sea salt and ground black pepper. Roll the tuna loin in this to crust the surfaces with a thick layer. Place the loin on the hot grill and seal briefly on all sides. The salt and pepper should cook into the surface, making a coat. The flesh should remain raw. Leave to cool completely. </p> <p>Cut the chillies in half lengthways.

      "byline": "Christopher Lloyd",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There are many perennials that we use as bedding plants. Most of them benefit from being rejuvenated by taking cuttings from them soon and using stock so raised for next year's bedding. Even if old plants would survive the winter to do another turn, young stock will be lustier, growing more vigorously and flowering over a longer period than the old lags. </p> <p>Diascias are typical. Quite a range of them have proved hardy under the winter conditions lately on offer, but we'll do even better with our stock if we have renewed it. I get very bored with the numerous kinds having a sort of salmon-pink colouring - 'Salmon Supreme' tells it all - but 'Red Start' comes near to a true red and has given us a lot of pleasure. </p> <p>As preferred propagation material, take young shoots that have arisen from the base of the plant. If they have flowerbuds on them, remove these. If there are no young shoots, just a lot of straggling old ones, shear the plant all over and wait for young shoots to appear. There's still plenty of growing time for this to happen. </p> <p>Even if you don't intend to take cuttings, this shearing, mid-season, is a good thing to do, as it will rejuvenate the plant's appearance. Don't be tender-hearted, protesting that shearing will remove extant buds and flowers. It'll be for a good cause and pay off in the long term. </p> <p>If the tip of the cutting is very soft, remove this and with a sharp blade remove the bottom leaves that would otherwise be buried. Insert your cuttings, with a dibber, quite thickly into pots containing a light, gritty compost. </p> <p>Personally, I like the compost to include about one-sixth loam as a buffer against starvation, because, although the cuttings will root quickly enough, we do not disturb them until the following spring, when they are potted off individually. There are two principal reasons for this delay: the first is the saving of precious under- glass space; and the second that it is generally better to keep plants just ticking over through the dark, cold months than to encourage growth when considerable heat would be required to sustain it. </p> <p>Most rooted cuttings that are just ticking over can be kept at a temperature just above freezing, or even just below. While still very soft and limp, most cuttings need to be kept close (without ventilation) and protected from direct sunlight. But as soon as they stiffen, it is wise to give a little ventilation, and then to increase it. Air circulation will discourage the onset of fungal disease, notably botrytis, which looks like a grey fur coat and is a rapid killer. </p> <p>The perennial nemesias are not unlike diascias, but in a different colour range that includes blue. They are similarly treated. The mauve Nemesia denticulata (syn. 'Confetti') has a long season and makes a large plant. And 'Innocence' is a fresh, pure white. </p> <p> Convolvulus sabatius (C. mauritanicus) is a charmer to have hanging over the edge of a pot or even down a retaining wall, starting from the top but working its way through the cracks. That will often survive the winter, especially if you leave its old growth by way of protection. But it is just as well to take cuttings, too. The flowers, like an open lamp-shade, are mauvy-blue, the colour strongest in the morning.

      "bodyText": "There are many perennials that we use as bedding plants. Most of them benefit from being rejuvenated by taking cuttings from them soon and using stock so raised for next year's bedding. Even if old plants would survive the winter to do another turn, young stock will be lustier, growing more vigorously and flowering over a longer period than the old lags. Diascias are typical. Quite a range of them have proved hardy under the winter conditions lately on offer, but we'll do even better with our stock if we have renewed it. I get very bored with the numerous kinds having a sort of salmon-pink colouring - 'Salmon Supreme' tells it all - but 'Red Start' comes near to a true red and has given us a lot of pleasure. As preferred propagation material, take young shoots that have arisen from the base of the plant. If they have flowerbuds on them, remove these. If there are no young shoots, just a lot of straggling old ones, shear the plant all over and wait for young shoots to appear. There's still plenty of growing time for this to happen. Even if you don't intend to take cuttings, this shearing, mid-season, is a good thing to do, as it will rejuvenate the plant's appearance. Don't be tender-hearted, protesting that shearing will remove extant buds and flowers. It'll be for a good cause and pay off in the long term. If the tip of the cutting is very soft, remove this and with a sharp blade remove the bottom leaves that would otherwise be buried. Insert your cuttings, with a dibber, quite thickly into pots containing a light, gritty compost. Personally, I like the compost to include about one-sixth loam as a buffer against starvation, because, although the cuttings will root quickly enough, we do not disturb them until the following spring, when they are potted off individually. There are two principal reasons for this delay: the first is the saving of precious under- glass space; and the second that it is generally better to keep plants just ticking over through the dark, cold months than to encourage growth when considerable heat would be required to sustain it. Most rooted cuttings that are just ticking over can be kept at a temperature just above freezing, or even just below. While still very soft and limp, most cuttings need to be kept close (without ventilation) and protected from direct sunlight. But as soon as they stiffen, it is wise to give a little ventilation, and then to increase it. Air circulation will discourage the onset of fungal disease, notably botrytis, which looks like a grey fur coat and is a rapid killer. The perennial nemesias are not unlike diascias, but in a different colour range that includes blue. They are similarly treated. The mauve Nemesia denticulata (syn. 'Confetti') has a long season and makes a large plant. And 'Innocence' is a fresh, pure white. Convolvulus sabatius (C. mauritanicus) is a charmer to have hanging over the edge of a pot or even down a retaining wall, starting from the top but working its way through the cracks. That will often survive the winter, especially if you leave its old growth by way of protection. But it is just as well to take cuttings, too. The flowers, like an open lamp-shade, are mauvy-blue, the colour strongest in the morning. And there is a worthwhile darker version. Even though they are often hardy (the plants can last for several years), I think that bedding penstemons frequently give the best, and certainly most even, results from young stock, raised from soft tip cuttings (but remove the over-soft tip itself), taken now. This is a case where, to avoid too much water loss through excess leaf area, it may be a good idea, having made your cutting, to slice off the top half of the leaves with a single cross-cut. One penstemon that impressed me in my garden this year is 'Chester Scarlet' - showy and as near to pure red as you'll find. This is a valuable colour in a mixed border from midsummer on, when good reds are rather scarce. You'll probably want to propagate your own 'geraniums' (bedding pelargoniums), whether zonal, ivy-leaved or fragrant-leaved, and they are simple enough. There was an old practice, which dies hard, of allowing the cuttings to wilt for several hours before inserting them. This is not, in fact, a good idea.

The historical part of the novel ends after Celesta's nuptials when Frankie, having elaborately scammed Medora and left his old mate Salvatore drowning in the dockyard mud, steps back onto the boat. All this proceeds at a cracking pace, full of neat but unobtrusive gestures at the horrors beneath. There follows a further 50 pages set in the diminished present, in which the survivors return to attend Mary's funeral. Though the re-encounters and revelations are skilfully handled, the effect is curiously dispiriting. It is as if Azzopardi, mistrusting her readers' ability to decode the hints strewn over the preceding four-fifths of the book, now feels that she has to chalk its myriad connections up on a metaphorical blackboard. Sharply written, full of crisp little vignettes and cameos, The Hiding Place could have done without its over-extended finale.",

Be that as it may, after studying the candidates intensely for a month and more, the selectors have been so uncertain where best to pin the tail that they might as well have attempted it blindfolded. </p> <p>The choice for the Oval, where England seek to protect their 2-1 lead, and so beat West Indies in a series for the first time since 1969, rests between two left-arm spinners: Phil Tufnell and Ashley Giles. With the successful candidate virtually guaranteed selection for Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the debate has been prolonged. </p> <p>Giles' tendinitis, which demanded injections and rest this week, has not come at a propitious time. He will turn out for Warwickshire in tomorrow's NatWest final against Gloucestershire at Lord's, which would normally allay doubts about his fitness. But England have sought to release pressure from their Oval squad by all but guaranteeing a tour place. \"It is highly unlikely that any of the party won't go to Pakistan,\" the chairman of selectors, David Graveney, has asserted. There will be much conjecture, therefore, about whether Giles' tendons will be able to withstand hard Asian grounds. </p> <p>Giles has delivered what the selectors have asked this season. Warwickshire's weakened seam bowling has allowed him longer and more rewarding spells. He has also batted high enough, averaging around 40, to have realistic claims as an England No8, which is beyond Tufnell's means. And eight is where he would be most likely to bat at the Oval, if England dared to omit one of the seven specialist batsmen who played at Headingley. </p> <p>Most expect them to jettison Graeme Hick when the squad is announced tomorrow, even though his partnership with Michael Vaughan was essential to England's win. Serious consideration will also be given to the omission of Michael Atherton, with Vaughan offering an opening option. If England opt for Tufnell then leaving out Dominic Cork, in the name of bolstering the batting, is possible, although a double century for Derbyshire this week should have banished the notion. </p> <p>\"I've done a lot of bowling because we've missed our strike bowlers a lot this year - not just Allan Donald because of injury, but Ed Giddins on Test duty,\" Giles said. \"Longer spells immediately up your confidence. I know that the contest between the spinners has been called a donkey derby, so it's best just to get on with the job.\" </p> <p>Giles is not a big spinner of the ball, but he has worked with Bob Woolmer, Warwickshire's coach, on varying his position on the crease. A release from his all-too-common fate of just bowling to hold an end up has also had a positive psychological effect. A successful England A tour in Sri Lanka three years ago also emphasised his resilience in such sapping humidity. </p> <p>All that does not counter the belief that Tufnell remains the best left-arm spinner in the country. While Middlesex are in a slump, Tufnell has 55 first-class wickets at 22. But nine years have passed since he took six for 25 at the Oval when the West Indies tried to launch him over the gasometer and since then he has flickered along at gas mark two. And his ability to survive the rigours of two Asian tours can hardly be taken for granted. </p> <p>With the winter tours in mind, England are considering four off-spinners - the Northamptonshire pair Graeme Swann and Jason Brown, Peter Such, who cannot even be sure of a place in Essex's first XI, and Robert Croft, who after briefly being lauded this summer for a new enterprising approach, has within weeks become as much out of favour as the lemon Starburst, although at least the lemon Starburst made your mouth water. Croft should not be lightly overlooked. </p> <p>Swann has had a chastening experience since an inactive South Africa tour last winter. Attention has switched to Jason Brown, 25, who has shot to prominence with 50 first-class wickets at 20s. He is unassuming, Swann is confident, and to pick either would be a huge gamble. </p> <p>Chris Schofield, England contracted on the grounds of potential, should be an automatic leg-spin choice for at least one tour, and any talk of recalling Ian Salisbury, because of a successful alliance at Surrey with Saqlain Mushtaq, should be resisted. </p> <p>Schofield is running back into form, according to Lancashire's wicketkeeper, Warren Hegg, although if Hegg had to pick a spinner for the Oval it would be his slow left-arm partner, Gary Keedy. </p> <p>The England Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have announced that Simon Pack, International Teams Director, is to leave its employ next month after three years in the post. </p> <p> <strong> England 12</strong> (probable): Hussain (capt), Atherton, Trescothick, Thorpe, Stewart, Vaughan, Hick, White, Giles, Cork, Gough, Caddick.</p>",

Most expect them to jettison Graeme Hick when the squad is announced tomorrow, even though his partnership with Michael Vaughan was essential to England's win. Serious consideration will also be given to the omission of Michael Atherton, with Vaughan offering an opening option. If England opt for Tufnell then leaving out Dominic Cork, in the name of bolstering the batting, is possible, although a double century for Derbyshire this week should have banished the notion. \"I've done a lot of bowling because we've missed our strike bowlers a lot this year - not just Allan Donald because of injury, but Ed Giddins on Test duty,\" Giles said. \"Longer spells immediately up your confidence. I know that the contest between the spinners has been called a donkey derby, so it's best just to get on with the job.\" Giles is not a big spinner of the ball, but he has worked with Bob Woolmer, Warwickshire's coach, on varying his position on the crease. A release from his all-too-common fate of just bowling to hold an end up has also had a positive psychological effect. A successful England A tour in Sri Lanka three years ago also emphasised his resilience in such sapping humidity. All that does not counter the belief that Tufnell remains the best left-arm spinner in the country. While Middlesex are in a slump, Tufnell has 55 first-class wickets at 22. But nine years have passed since he took six for 25 at the Oval when the West Indies tried to launch him over the gasometer and since then he has flickered along at gas mark two. And his ability to survive the rigours of two Asian tours can hardly be taken for granted. With the winter tours in mind, England are considering four off-spinners - the Northamptonshire pair Graeme Swann and Jason Brown, Peter Such, who cannot even be sure of a place in Essex's first XI, and Robert Croft, who after briefly being lauded this summer for a new enterprising approach, has within weeks become as much out of favour as the lemon Starburst, although at least the lemon Starburst made your mouth water. Croft should not be lightly overlooked. Swann has had a chastening experience since an inactive South Africa tour last winter. Attention has switched to Jason Brown, 25, who has shot to prominence with 50 first-class wickets at 20s. He is unassuming, Swann is confident, and to pick either would be a huge gamble. Chris Schofield, England contracted on the grounds of potential, should be an automatic leg-spin choice for at least one tour, and any talk of recalling Ian Salisbury, because of a successful alliance at Surrey with Saqlain Mushtaq, should be resisted. Schofield is running back into form, according to Lancashire's wicketkeeper, Warren Hegg, although if Hegg had to pick a spinner for the Oval it would be his slow left-arm partner, Gary Keedy. The England Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have announced that Simon Pack, International Teams Director, is to leave its employ next month after three years in the post. England 12 (probable): Hussain (capt), Atherton, Trescothick, Thorpe, Stewart, Vaughan, Hick, White, Giles, Cork, Gough, Caddick.",

Yet with an astute formula that takes into account everything from the quirks of the psyche and Jack Russell's cherished baked beans to individual strengths and flaws, they have outfought and frightened the life out of opponents whose sides are stacked with more illustrious names. </p> <p>Bracewell, 42, the tall, lean Kiwi who patrols the outfield during a county match looking like a middle-aged venture scout in shorts he has outgrown, is eternally vibrant with new ideas, paternal common sense and striking phraseology. He talks about one of Gloucestershire's first finals under him: \"Of the awe in actually being there, the excitement, the butterflies flying in unison.\" </p> <p>One of four cricketing brothers who himself played in 41 Tests, he was known at home for his high-action off-spinners that attacked the batsmen rather than contained their scoring; for his extrovert traits and the ambitious glint that suggested one day he hoped to be the national coach. </p> <p>He remains extrovert, ready with a contentious view when he thinks it is justified - just ask Worcestershire, who still feel hard done by that Gloucestershire were given a second shot at them after they played an unqualified bowler - and is probably the most articulate, intrepid, single-minded coach on the domestic circuit. </p> <p>\"Competitive, me? I'd rather you called me passionate. I like fighting causes, championing the underdog. I've socialist tendencies. In another age I'd probably have been a martyr or, at the turn of the previous century, a union representative. I think all coaches should be socialists, you know - they should have the interests of the team first and how all the parts make up that team. If the coach only concentrates on individuals who are statistically successful, then he'll run into trouble.\" </p> <p>It is not usual to be given political or social treatises in the context of cricket. But then he returns to today's game: \"We have players particularly equipped for the one-day game. Many of them are frustrated footballers. They throw themselves around in the field. All I've done is create the environment for learning. I take a great pride in the sharing of knowledge.\" </p> <p>His approach encompasses diet and discipline. He discourages too much drinking. He doesn't like mickey-taking (\"it's a belittling kind of humour\"). He denies he is a martinet: \"I get the players to set the standards - I tell them the rules are theirs not mine.\" </p> <p>The players occasionally exchange looks as he comes up with another theory or drives them relentlessly in exercise. Mike Smith, one of the more experienced players, says: \"John is intense, determined. He certainly doesn't like losing. He'll be treating any attempts at a wind-up by Bob Woolmer very seriously indeed.\" Chris Taylor, in his first season, says: \"He has been very encouraging to me as a newcomer. The advice he gives is very much on an individual basis.\" </p> <p>Bracewell argues that he has the bonus of an outstanding one-day captain in Mark Alleyne: \"He has a natural instinct for it.\" But every member of the team will be studiously told what he has to do within Gloucestershire's formula. \"The guys are prepared to switch and change to fit in.\" </p> <p>Many thought Bracewell would have gone by now, back to New Zealand as their coach. It looks as though his contract will be extended at Bristol, however. \"I'm still only an apprentice, making my way and making notes as I go. To be honest, I'm a bit afraid of becoming a national coach, not sure I'm quite ready.\" </p> <p>He says he gave up playing in 1990 because he did not want to be an absentee parent. He did not want to keep on touring. Now his children are being educated in Bristol. \"For the time being I'm keen to attend their school concerts and see them playing games.\" </p> <p>Bracewell refutes any suggestion that he prefers to concentrate much of his energy and thinking on the one-day game. \"My long-term aim is for Gloucestershire to win the championship - they just have to add something to their mental attitude.\" In the short term it is likely they will want to bat first - though 12 out of the past 13 finals have gone to the team batting last - and for Tim Hancock and Kim Barnett to race away in the style that has served them so well. </p> <p>By contrast, it is hard to know what has been going through Bob Woolmer's mind. Has the homecoming to Warwickshire been as embracing and reassuring as he would have liked? He, too, is talented, fluent in conversation, with plenty of opinions. When he was previously at Edgbaston, the silverware bulged from the cabinets. Brian Lara was hitting 500 runs in an innings, Dermot Reeve was winding up opponents and motivating his players, who in turn were winning almost everything going. </p> <p>Woolmer badly needs to recruit additional talent as much as he needs the psychological lift of a win today. Soon Allan Donald, capable of making an aggressively crucial Lord's exit, will be gone - and no doubt Ed Giddins, too, if as seems likely he moves back south. </p> <p>There has also been some anxiety over the captaincy. Woolmer appears to wonder whether Neil Smith should be automatically assured of a place when another slow bowler, Ashley Giles, is around? Is Smith, doubtless desperate to do well today, reliable enough from down the order as a batsman in championship matches? </p> <p>Warwickshire still have match-winners and players who can respond to the glamour of the occasion. They also need overdue restored status. But it does look as though Gloucestershire, those west country upstarts, are at least ahead in the mind games.</p>",

But then he returns to today's game: \"We have players particularly equipped for the one-day game. Many of them are frustrated footballers. They throw themselves around in the field. All I've done is create the environment for learning. I take a great pride in the sharing of knowledge.\" His approach encompasses diet and discipline. He discourages too much drinking. He doesn't like mickey-taking (\"it's a belittling kind of humour\"). He denies he is a martinet: \"I get the players to set the standards - I tell them the rules are theirs not mine.\" The players occasionally exchange looks as he comes up with another theory or drives them relentlessly in exercise. Mike Smith, one of the more experienced players, says: \"John is intense, determined. He certainly doesn't like losing. He'll be treating any attempts at a wind-up by Bob Woolmer very seriously indeed.\" Chris Taylor, in his first season, says: \"He has been very encouraging to me as a newcomer. The advice he gives is very much on an individual basis.\" Bracewell argues that he has the bonus of an outstanding one-day captain in Mark Alleyne: \"He has a natural instinct for it.\" But every member of the team will be studiously told what he has to do within Gloucestershire's formula. \"The guys are prepared to switch and change to fit in.\" Many thought Bracewell would have gone by now, back to New Zealand as their coach. It looks as though his contract will be extended at Bristol, however. \"I'm still only an apprentice, making my way and making notes as I go. To be honest, I'm a bit afraid of becoming a national coach, not sure I'm quite ready.\" He says he gave up playing in 1990 because he did not want to be an absentee parent. He did not want to keep on touring. Now his children are being educated in Bristol. \"For the time being I'm keen to attend their school concerts and see them playing games.\" Bracewell refutes any suggestion that he prefers to concentrate much of his energy and thinking on the one-day game. \"My long-term aim is for Gloucestershire to win the championship - they just have to add something to their mental attitude.\" In the short term it is likely they will want to bat first - though 12 out of the past 13 finals have gone to the team batting last - and for Tim Hancock and Kim Barnett to race away in the style that has served them so well. By contrast, it is hard to know what has been going through Bob Woolmer's mind. Has the homecoming to Warwickshire been as embracing and reassuring as he would have liked? He, too, is talented, fluent in conversation, with plenty of opinions. When he was previously at Edgbaston, the silverware bulged from the cabinets. Brian Lara was hitting 500 runs in an innings, Dermot Reeve was winding up opponents and motivating his players, who in turn were winning almost everything going. Woolmer badly needs to recruit additional talent as much as he needs the psychological lift of a win today. Soon Allan Donald, capable of making an aggressively crucial Lord's exit, will be gone - and no doubt Ed Giddins, too, if as seems likely he moves back south. There has also been some anxiety over the captaincy. Woolmer appears to wonder whether Neil Smith should be automatically assured of a place when another slow bowler, Ashley Giles, is around? Is Smith, doubtless desperate to do well today, reliable enough from down the order as a batsman in championship matches? Warwickshire still have match-winners and players who can respond to the glamour of the occasion. They also need overdue restored status. But it does look as though Gloucestershire, those west country upstarts, are at least ahead in the mind games.",

      "body": "<p>It has not been a good week for Graham Poll. On Monday he was savaged by the Highbury crowd as he sent off Gary McAllister, Patrick Vieira and Dietmar Hamann. On Tuesday he was pilloried by the press. The next day he admitted that he was wrong about sending Hamann off, and yesterday an FA video review panel said that he had got the McAllister decision wrong too. </p> <p>The panel reduced McAllister's punishment to a yellow card and also charged Gilles Grimandi with misconduct after he was shown on television stamping on the Liverpool midfielder. As Poll runs out at Portman Road this afternoon, he could be forgiven for thinking that there is no part of English football that he has not alienated this season. </p> <p>The new FA panels are made up of three officials chosen from a pool of 12 former players and managers who are sent videotapes of incidents. The panel upheld Vieira's sending-off against Sunderland on the opening day of the season and also ordered that charges of misconduct should be brought against Preston North End and Sheffield United for a mass brawl. </p> <p>Although the panels' decisions can be overturned by the FA's disciplinary commission, their existence can only increase the pressure on referees, who already come in for plenty of criticism. A spokesman for the FA said: \"There has always been a right to appeal. The video panels are not designed to undermine referees. The pressure on them is not coming from the FA.\" </p> <p>Many within the game claim that the pressure on referees is self-generated. They say that too many red and yellow cards have been handed out by unreasonable referees who are unable to manage games properly. But referees insist they are doing nothing different this year and that they have been given only one new directive, borrowed from Euro 2000, where the refereeing was considered a success. </p> <p>According to Philip Don, referees officer for the Premier League, it was found that when referees clamp down on offences in the first 15 to 20 minutes it leads to less retaliation from players later in the match, firmly establishes the authority of the referee and allows the game to flow more smoothly. </p> <p>Two games into the new Premiership season and the men in the middle stand accused of doing exactly the opposite. The figures speak for themselves. After two matches in the Premiership last season only four red and 81 yellow cards had been shown, and four penalties and 516 free-kicks had been awarded. This season after two matches there have been eight red cards and 590 free-kicks. However, referees have shown only 72 yellow cards and given four penalties. </p> <p>Don insists that when the 20 Premier League referees met at Lilleshall to discuss the forthcoming season they were told to continue as last season in the way they run their games. Don said: \"Last season we went from a situation of clamping down on a number of areas to leniency, and nothing has changed as far as we are concerned. There is no new clampdown this season. </p> <p>\"We are still refereeing the same way as we were last season. In summing up to the referees at Lilleshall I reiterated that they should carry on as they had the previous season.\" </p> <p>Don denies that the new directive to clamp down early on minor offences is responsible for the increase in sending-offs. \"Our new directive has not led to more red cards. In fact, we told referees at Lilleshall not to caution too early, but obviously if a major offence is committed then ref erees have no option but to apply the letter of the law.\" </p> <p>Many feel, however, given the number of red cards this season, something has changed. Players and managers blame the referees, accusing them of not understanding the game, but Don and his colleagues claim that players and managers are responsible. </p> <p>Don said: \"We are at the beginning of a new season and players are going out there to impress. Squads are bigger, everybody is fighting for their places and they are raring to go. Everybody's got a responsibility. Referees seem to shoulder the blame for everything these days. Managers have a responsibility to control their players and players also have a responsibility.\" </p> <p>Don points to two games this past week as an example of how players can be held responsible for many of the problems. </p> <p>On Tuesday night, at Ipswich against Manchester United, the first free-kick was awarded in the 28th minute and by the end of the match a total of 16 free-kicks had been given. </p> <p>On Monday night, at the controversial Arsenal against Liverpool match, a total of 47 free-kicks were awarded. </p> <p>Don said: \"This has to be down to the attitude of the players. They must also share the blame. Monday night, for example, was a very difficult match. You cannot blame the referee.\" </p> <p><strong>What the rest of the Premiership thinks</strong></p> <p><strong> Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Arsenal manager</strong> </p> <p>\"I will not sit down with referees to discuss these problems. It is not my job to explain to them how to run the game. It is important there is respect on both sides but also that we don't become too friendly because then the pressure would be even greater. I feel there is respect for referees. I believe they try their best and are honest but they always have to try to improve. Some decisions have annoyed me. I feel sometimes I am part of a circus.\" </p> <p><strong> Roy Keane, Manchester United captain</strong> </p> <p>\"Everyone is under a lot of pressure, the players and the referees. To be fair to the refs, a lot of them are willing to hold up their hands after certain games and say: 'Yes, I did make a mistake.' We were criticised for having a go at Andy D'Urso last season and in cases like that, you have to realise the referee is only human and that, like us footballers, they will make mistakes. You have to hope it evens itself out over the season.\" </p> <p><strong> Martin Tyler, </strong></p> <p><strong>Sky Sports senior football commentator</strong> </p> <p>\"Referees are having to operate with one hand tied to their cards. By bringing in mandatory decision-making Fifa has undermined the managerial skills of top referees to deal with individual incidents and matches. Each referee has his own personality and style, but a lot of that has been lost in searching for a perfect world that you will never find. You cannot make 20 people referee the same way.\" </p> <p><strong> Neil Lennon, </strong></p> <p><strong>Leicester City midfielder</strong> </p> <p>\"This is the norm for the start of the season and, once an equilibrium is established between players, managers and referees, it will sort itself out. At the moment refs are a bit too hasty to dish out the bookings rather than having a quiet word. I thought Igor Stimac was unlucky against us at West Ham with the second booking. The ref might have said: \"One more challenge and you're gone.\" If that had been me, I'd have been a bit aggrieved. </p> <p> <strong> The Premiership players sent off so far this season are:<br></strong></p> <p><strong> Charity Shield: Aug 13 </strong> Roy Keane (Man Utd) v Chelsea </p> <p><strong> Premiership:</strong> <strong> Aug 19 </strong> Patrick Vieira (Arsenal) v Sunderland, David Thompson (Coventry) v Middlesbrough <strong> Aug 21 </strong> Vieira (Arsenal) v Liverpool; Gary McAllister, Dietmar Hamann (Liverpool) <strong> Aug 23</strong> Warren Barton (Newcastle) v Derby, Carl Tiler (Charlton) v Everton, Igor Stimac (West Ham v Leicester) </p> <p><strong> Europe: Aug 8</strong> Olivier Dacourt, Eirik Bakke (Leeds) v 1860 Munich</p>",

They say that too many red and yellow cards have been handed out by unreasonable referees who are unable to manage games properly. But referees insist they are doing nothing different this year and that they have been given only one new directive, borrowed from Euro 2000, where the refereeing was considered a success. According to Philip Don, referees officer for the Premier League, it was found that when referees clamp down on offences in the first 15 to 20 minutes it leads to less retaliation from players later in the match, firmly establishes the authority of the referee and allows the game to flow more smoothly. Two games into the new Premiership season and the men in the middle stand accused of doing exactly the opposite. The figures speak for themselves. After two matches in the Premiership last season only four red and 81 yellow cards had been shown, and four penalties and 516 free-kicks had been awarded. This season after two matches there have been eight red cards and 590 free-kicks. However, referees have shown only 72 yellow cards and given four penalties. Don insists that when the 20 Premier League referees met at Lilleshall to discuss the forthcoming season they were told to continue as last season in the way they run their games. Don said: \"Last season we went from a situation of clamping down on a number of areas to leniency, and nothing has changed as far as we are concerned. There is no new clampdown this season. \"We are still refereeing the same way as we were last season. In summing up to the referees at Lilleshall I reiterated that they should carry on as they had the previous season.\" Don denies that the new directive to clamp down early on minor offences is responsible for the increase in sending-offs. \"Our new directive has not led to more red cards. In fact, we told referees at Lilleshall not to caution too early, but obviously if a major offence is committed then ref erees have no option but to apply the letter of the law.\" Many feel, however, given the number of red cards this season, something has changed. Players and managers blame the referees, accusing them of not understanding the game, but Don and his colleagues claim that players and managers are responsible. Don said: \"We are at the beginning of a new season and players are going out there to impress. Squads are bigger, everybody is fighting for their places and they are raring to go. Everybody's got a responsibility. Referees seem to shoulder the blame for everything these days. Managers have a responsibility to control their players and players also have a responsibility.\" Don points to two games this past week as an example of how players can be held responsible for many of the problems. On Tuesday night, at Ipswich against Manchester United, the first free-kick was awarded in the 28th minute and by the end of the match a total of 16 free-kicks had been given. On Monday night, at the controversial Arsenal against Liverpool match, a total of 47 free-kicks were awarded. Don said: \"This has to be down to the attitude of the players. They must also share the blame. Monday night, for example, was a very difficult match. You cannot blame the referee.\" What the rest of the Premiership thinks Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Arsenal manager \"I will not sit down with referees to discuss these problems. It is not my job to explain to them how to run the game. It is important there is respect on both sides but also that we don't become too friendly because then the pressure would be even greater. I feel there is respect for referees. I believe they try their best and are honest but they always have to try to improve. Some decisions have annoyed me. I feel sometimes I am part of a circus.\" Roy Keane, Manchester United captain \"Everyone is under a lot of pressure, the players and the referees. To be fair to the refs, a lot of them are willing to hold up their hands after certain games and say: 'Yes, I did make a mistake.' We were criticised for having a go at Andy D'Urso last season and in cases like that, you have to realise the referee is only human and that, like us footballers, they will make mistakes. You have to hope it evens itself out over the season.\" Martin Tyler, Sky Sports senior football commentator \"Referees are having to operate with one hand tied to their cards. By bringing in mandatory decision-making Fifa has undermined the managerial skills of top referees to deal with individual incidents and matches. Each referee has his own personality and style, but a lot of that has been lost in searching for a perfect world that you will never find. You cannot make 20 people referee the same way.\" Neil Lennon, Leicester City midfielder \"This is the norm for the start of the season and, once an equilibrium is established between players, managers and referees, it will sort itself out. At the moment refs are a bit too hasty to dish out the bookings rather than having a quiet word. I thought Igor Stimac was unlucky against us at West Ham with the second booking. The ref might have said: \"One more challenge and you're gone.\" If that had been me, I'd have been a bit aggrieved. The Premiership players sent off so far this season are: Charity Shield: Aug 13 Roy Keane (Man Utd) v Chelsea Premiership: Aug 19 Patrick Vieira (Arsenal) v Sunderland, David Thompson (Coventry) v Middlesbrough Aug 21 Vieira (Arsenal) v Liverpool; Gary McAllister, Dietmar Hamann (Liverpool) Aug 23 Warren Barton (Newcastle) v Derby, Carl Tiler (Charlton) v Everton, Igor Stimac (West Ham v Leicester) Europe: Aug 8 Olivier Dacourt, Eirik Bakke (Leeds) v 1860 Munich",

      "bodyText": "Scotland's manager Craig Brown intends to give his key midfielder Craig Burley every chance to prove his fitness before their World Cup qualifying campaign gets under way in Latvia a week today. The Derby player, who Brown named in a 23-man squad yesterday, is expected to miss today's club match at Everton due to injury. \"He's in London having a specialist look at his calf,\" the manager said. \"Burley is a key member of the squad and without him we've got to improvise either at right-back or in midfield.\" Brown also gave the thumbs-up to the veteran centre-half Colin Hendry, who was also named despite being dropped by his club Coventry after their first game of the season. \"You want settled players when you make your selection but an experienced player like that will be able to shrug it off,\" Brown said. \"It's a disappointment, obviously, that he's not going to get match practice at Coventry. But he's never let Scotland down.\" Newcastle's Kevin Gallacher is likely to earn his 50th cap in Riga, which would make him only the 22nd Scot to reach that landmark. And Celtic's transfer-listed striker Mark Burchill could find himself being elevated from the Under-21s, who play in Riga on the Friday evening, if he impresses in tomorrow's Old Firm derby at Parkhead. Scotland, who were drawn against Latvia in the 1998 World Cup qualifiers and beat them 2-0 in both matches, will be hoping for a good start as their next two fixtures are also away from Hampden Park, in San Marino and then Croatia, both in October. Ipswich's captain Matt Holland and Watford's reserve striker Dominic Foley have been named in the Republic of Ireland squad for their World Cup qualifier against Holland in Amsterdam next Saturday. Both impressed during the Republic's three-match unbeaten tour of the United States, though the manager Mick McCarthy has pruned his original 30-man squad down to 22 with Manchester United's Roy Keane again named as the captain. Republic squad : A Kelly (Blackburn), Given (Newcastle, Kiely (Charlton), Carr (Tottenham), G Kelly (Leeds), Harte (Leeds), Staunton (Liverpool), Breen (Coventry), Dunne (Everton), Babb (Sporting Lisbon), Roy Keane (Man Utd), Kinsella (Charlton), Finnan (Fulham), McAteer (Blackburn), Kennedy (Man City), Kilbane (Sunderland), Duff (Blackburn), Holland (Ipswich), Quinn (Sunderland), Connolly (Excelsior), Robbie Keane (Inter), Foley (Watford). Scotland squad : Douglas (Dundee), Gould (Celtic), Sullivan (Tottenham), Boyd (Celtic), Dailly (Blackburn), Elliott (Leicester), Hendry (Coventry), Naysmith (Hearts), O'Neil (Wolfsburg), Pressley (Hearts), Weir (Everton), Burley (Derby), Cameron (Hearts), Davidson (Leicester), Ferguson (Rangers), Holt (Kilmarnock), Johnston (Rangers), Lambert (Celtic), McNamara (Celtic), Dodds (Rangers), Gallacher (Newcastle), Hutchison (Sunderland), McCann (Rangers).",

      "bodyText": "A football fan who was filmed hitting a rival woman fan at a cup final match was cleared of assault yesterday. Former nightclub doorman Jonathan Edmonds admitted punching Leicester fan Ruth Lelacheur during the 1999 Worthington Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur. She suffered from a bruised head and damaged tooth after being hit by Edmonds several times. But the jury accepted his claim that he was acting in self-defence. Edmonds, 32, broke down in tears in the dock when he apologised to Ms Lelacheur, 30, who had gone to the match with her partner Jim Blockley and three-year-old daughter Megan. Edmonds, who is 6ft 5in, said: \"I'm deeply sorry for what has happened, I didn't mean to do it to her.\" Edmonds told the court that he had lashed out after he and three friends were set upon by Leicester fans who were unhappy that they were sitting in the Leicester end of the ground. The jury saw CCTV footage of Edmonds falling to the ground after taking several blows to the face. He tried to get up, but was knocked to the ground several times before stumbling towards Ms Lelacheur. Edmonds said there was no way of knowing whether she was a man or a woman as he lashed out in an attempt to get away from the Leicester fans. He said: \"People were getting very agitated and the Leicester fans started swearing a lot. \"My friend told me to stand up otherwise I was going to get hurt, so I stood up and received a blow to the face. \"I went down on the ground and tried to get up again, but I couldn't. I must have been knocked to the ground three or four times. I was being hit left, right and centre. \"Everything was a blur. I had to lash out as I had no other way of getting out of there.\" Edmonds eventually left the stadium and went to a nearby pub to watch the match on television. The prosecution claimed Edmonds and his friends had provoked the fight by standing up and shouting: \"We are Tottenham. We are Tottenham.\" Edmonds denied this. He said he had no idea he would be in with Leicester fans when he bought his ticket from a friend. He said that the Leicester fans had somehow realised he and his friends were Spurs supporters, but he insisted they had done nothing which would have given them away. He said that he would never hit a woman and was deeply disturbed by footage showing him hitting Ms Lelacheur. Edmonds was not identified at the time of the match despite pictures of the incident appearing in several national newspapers and on television. He decided to contact the police in March of this year after the pictures were shown on BBC's Crimewatch programme. The jury at Harrow crown court took three hours to clear Edmonds, of Slough, Berkshire, of assault causing actual bodily harm and a separate charge of affray. His wife Tracey broke down in tears and his friends cheered as the verdict was read out. Mr Blockley said that his partner had been denied justice and he would try to find some way of bringing Edmonds back to court. \"We were gutted by the verdict.

      "body": "<p>Less than a week into the new Premiership season and English football is giving every appearance of a boiler about to explode. But still the coals of controversy are being fed into the furnace with referees, players, managers and media all stoking away merrily. </p> <p>In the space of five days eight red cards have been flourished, two of them likely to be rescinded, and two more in the direction of Patrick Vieira, the cr\u00e8neme brul\u00e9e of Arsenal's midfield, a player of sweet skills but ever likely to burst into flames. Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger also faces a misconduct charge following an alleged incident with the fourth official after the match at Sunderland last Saturday. </p> <p>Already there is a stand-off between referees determined to crack down and managers angry at seeing their teams depleted. \"Spectators pay to watch a match between 22 players,\" argued Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager, after Igor Stimac was dismissed for a second bookable offence against Leicester on Wednesday. </p> <p>\"Some of these referees are prima donnas,\" declared Sir Alex Ferguson after three of his Manchester United players were cautioned for arguing with Jeff Winter at Ipswich the previous evening. Referees might feel entitled to retort that the managerial trade contains a higher density of divas than La Scala Milan and that United have more yap than Battersea dogs home. </p> <p>Clearly the Premier League is in dire need of a thermostat to stop emotions boiling over and spoiling what has otherwise been a highly entertaining start to the season. Those most closely involved - referees, managers and players - need to pause and take stock of a situation which threatens to get out of hand. </p> <p>It does not have to be like this. A glance at an old video tape just before the Premiership kicked off brought to light coverage of a match between Arsenal and Liverpool recorded so long ago that the result had slipped the memory.

      "bodyText": "Less than a week into the new Premiership season and English football is giving every appearance of a boiler about to explode. But still the coals of controversy are being fed into the furnace with referees, players, managers and media all stoking away merrily. In the space of five days eight red cards have been flourished, two of them likely to be rescinded, and two more in the direction of Patrick Vieira, the cr\u00e8neme brul\u00e9e of Arsenal's midfield, a player of sweet skills but ever likely to burst into flames. Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger also faces a misconduct charge following an alleged incident with the fourth official after the match at Sunderland last Saturday. Already there is a stand-off between referees determined to crack down and managers angry at seeing their teams depleted. \"Spectators pay to watch a match between 22 players,\" argued Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager, after Igor Stimac was dismissed for a second bookable offence against Leicester on Wednesday. \"Some of these referees are prima donnas,\" declared Sir Alex Ferguson after three of his Manchester United players were cautioned for arguing with Jeff Winter at Ipswich the previous evening. Referees might feel entitled to retort that the managerial trade contains a higher density of divas than La Scala Milan and that United have more yap than Battersea dogs home. Clearly the Premier League is in dire need of a thermostat to stop emotions boiling over and spoiling what has otherwise been a highly entertaining start to the season. Those most closely involved - referees, managers and players - need to pause and take stock of a situation which threatens to get out of hand. It does not have to be like this. A glance at an old video tape just before the Premiership kicked off brought to light coverage of a match between Arsenal and Liverpool recorded so long ago that the result had slipped the memory. Certainly the game belonged to another age. The football was fast and competitive but there were no rows or sendings off. There were no foreigners on show either, but the skills of John Barnes and Peter Beardsley for Liverpool and David Rocastle and Paul Merson for Arsenal brightened a dull winter's day.

The referee Graham Poll, who had sent off Gary McAllister and Dietmar Hamann of Liverpool, as well as Vieira, was given a standing vilification extraordinary even by normal standards of crowd abuse.

      "body": "<p>Some people are never satisfied. On the website run by the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association a member recently posted a bitter moan. There had been a problem processing his season ticket, it seems, so he had written to the club to complain and the new chief executive Peter Kenyon had personally rung him to sort things out. And was the lad happy? No he wasn't. Didn't Peter Kenyon realise that as a schoolboy his time was precious? That was the gist of the lad's complaint, and he didn't need some bloke ringing him at home. I am pretty sure he wasn't being ironic. </p> <p>Mind you, it is not hard to understand his cynicism. Good PR and Manchester United are not often linked in the public mind. Arrogance rather than communication has been the order of the day. Huge PR blunders have stumbled out of the club continuously. There was, for instance, the letter sent to season ticket holders stating that the increase in prices was due to the increase in Roy Keane's salary, this in the week that the annual report revealed a profit of over \u00a320m. Then there was the statement warning fans not to travel to Rio for last season's World Club Championship, advice which hugely upset the hosts with the ignorant picture it painted of Brazil as a crime-ridden hell-hole. </p> <p>But all this, the club hope, will change with the appointment of Kenyon in place of Martin Edwards. Kenyon, with his background at the kit manufacturer Umbro, is experienced enough in the real world of business to appreciate that true communication with customers involves more than posting out a mail-order catalogue once a year. </p> <p>Since he took the helm he has been assiduous in trying to change the aloof, greedy image his boardroom has exuded for a decade. He has returned journalists' calls, organised open training sessions and turned up at a meeting organised by an independent fans' group in a Stretford pub. There are also rumours that he is minded to fill a new post of director of communications with one of the supporters who masterminded the successful campaign against Sky's takeover. </p> <p>And this week he announced plans to set up a fans' forum, with voting overseen by the Electoral Reform Society to elect a body designed to articulate supporters' interests. It will report directly to Kenyon himself. </p> <p>\"It's very encouraging,\" says Andy Mitten, editor of the fanzine United We Stand. \"United have been very aloof. Martin Edwards thought building a stadium and a team was all that was required to keep fans happy. But there is a real need to connect and address their concerns: about the atmosphere in the ground, about the way local youngsters are squeezed out by corporate pricing, about ticket distribution. Of course actions speak louder than words and there is a well founded, deep-rooted cynicism among hard-core fans caused by being wholly exploited this past decade. But this is very definitely a start.\" </p> <p>The big question is, since United have been so successful without addressing their match-going supporters' concerns, why should they bother now? After all the fans are not going to switch allegiance and support City, are they? </p> <p>Well, they might. After 10 years of being told to sit down, shut up and anyway they are not as welcome as tourists from Scandinavia, it would be no surprise if many a young Mancunian were drawn to Maine Road. </p> <p>With clubs so high-geared financially, the strategy of ignoring one market while pursuing others is no longer viable. </p> <p>With a hugely extended stadium having to finance hugely inflated wages, not even United can afford to ostracise a single bum that might occupy one of their 67,000 seats. The warning signals were posted when, for the first time since the Premiership started, enough tickets were left over for a game next month to be put on open sale. Kenyon may have been reading the runes.</p>",

Good PR and Manchester United are not often linked in the public mind. Arrogance rather than communication has been the order of the day. Huge PR blunders have stumbled out of the club continuously. There was, for instance, the letter sent to season ticket holders stating that the increase in prices was due to the increase in Roy Keane's salary, this in the week that the annual report revealed a profit of over \u00a320m. Then there was the statement warning fans not to travel to Rio for last season's World Club Championship, advice which hugely upset the hosts with the ignorant picture it painted of Brazil as a crime-ridden hell-hole. But all this, the club hope, will change with the appointment of Kenyon in place of Martin Edwards. Kenyon, with his background at the kit manufacturer Umbro, is experienced enough in the real world of business to appreciate that true communication with customers involves more than posting out a mail-order catalogue once a year. Since he took the helm he has been assiduous in trying to change the aloof, greedy image his boardroom has exuded for a decade. He has returned journalists' calls, organised open training sessions and turned up at a meeting organised by an independent fans' group in a Stretford pub. There are also rumours that he is minded to fill a new post of director of communications with one of the supporters who masterminded the successful campaign against Sky's takeover. And this week he announced plans to set up a fans' forum, with voting overseen by the Electoral Reform Society to elect a body designed to articulate supporters' interests. It will report directly to Kenyon himself. \"It's very encouraging,\" says Andy Mitten, editor of the fanzine United We Stand. \"United have been very aloof. Martin Edwards thought building a stadium and a team was all that was required to keep fans happy. But there is a real need to connect and address their concerns: about the atmosphere in the ground, about the way local youngsters are squeezed out by corporate pricing, about ticket distribution. Of course actions speak louder than words and there is a well founded, deep-rooted cynicism among hard-core fans caused by being wholly exploited this past decade. But this is very definitely a start.\" The big question is, since United have been so successful without addressing their match-going supporters' concerns, why should they bother now? After all the fans are not going to switch allegiance and support City, are they? Well, they might. After 10 years of being told to sit down, shut up and anyway they are not as welcome as tourists from Scandinavia, it would be no surprise if many a young Mancunian were drawn to Maine Road. With clubs so high-geared financially, the strategy of ignoring one market while pursuing others is no longer viable. With a hugely extended stadium having to finance hugely inflated wages, not even United can afford to ostracise a single bum that might occupy one of their 67,000 seats. The warning signals were posted when, for the first time since the Premiership started, enough tickets were left over for a game next month to be put on open sale. Kenyon may have been reading the runes.",

As its head John Woodward put it in an interview with the French trade magazine Le Film Fran\u00e7ais, published yesterday in the Guardian, the Film Council is not interested in making low-budget \"social realist art films\", whatever they are. </p> <p>All the more embarrassing, then, that in this year's new British cinema at Edinburgh, it is the \"social realist art films\" - some of them made on staggeringly low budgets - that stand out as the most exciting material on offer. </p> <p>One of them is a digital production shot in Glasgow on a micro-budget (in the \"low five-figures\", according to the director). One Life Stand is the feature debut by May Miles Thomas, who not only wrote and directed, but also shot the film and edited it herself at home on her PC. It's an object lesson in telling a story cheaply and turning the visual rough edges to your advantage - but all that would just be production anecdote if not for the fact that this is a very fine film indeed. </p> <p>Social realist art cinema? Yes, in the sense that it addresses everyday British life in all its banality and desperation, and that it has an artistic edge in Thomas's stark, melancholy compositions. </p> <p>The tightly-scripted story is in a well-established kitchen-sink lineage - the Play For Today tradition that television no longer sees fit to bother with. Trise (Maureen Carr), a strapped-for-cash single mother, works on a dial-a-tarot phone line and finds herself uneasily lending a sympathetic ear to the desperate callers. Meanwhile, her narcissistic teenage son (John Kielty) fancies himself as a male model but finds himself only making headway as a rent boy. This tough, harrowing but often uncomfortably funny drama gives the slice-of-life genre a new surge of energy. The sense of enclosure, as the digital black-and-white photography explores cramped apartments, bedrooms and offices, creates an uneasy intimacy that brings the characters vibrantly alive: by the end of it we know every crease on Trise's brow. </p> <p>The acting is uniformly superb, and while the film is socially engaged, it doesn't take the Ken Loach route of spelling things out for us. It's a moot point whether our film and TV industry currently has room for a hard-boiled case like Thomas - but it should. </p> <p>Another realist, already established, is Paul Pawlikowski, who made the BBC docudrama Twockers. But with Last Resort, written by Rowan Joffe, he has really arrived. </p> <p>Tanya (Dina Korzun), a young Russian mother, arrives in Britain with her young son and ends up consigned to a holding centre for asylum seekers - a desolate seaside resort that's like Butlins doubling as Kafka's Penal Colony, all hollowly ringing amusement arcades and fried fish that's pure batter. </p> <p>The film works brilliantly on several levels - as an intimately observed character piece, as a quasi-documentary expos\u00e9 on the conditions of life for asylum seekers and as an impressionistic depiction of our wretched cultural landscape, shot with an eye for poetic drabness by Ryszard Lenczewski. </p> <p>Korzun is a tender, affecting presence, but the scene-stealer - playing the seedy bingo caller who befriends Tanya - is Paddy Considine, who made his mark as the shell-suited maniac in Shane Meadows's A Room For Romeo Brass, and is shaping up to be a compulsive and natural player. </p> <p>A different kind of realism - funkier and lighter but still tough - comes in The Low Down. Superficially resembling the This Life school of drama, it has a gang of moderately groovy young urbanites experiencing love and other catastrophes in Hackney. </p> <p>But Jamie Thraves's film, shot and edited with a jumpy exuberance that owes a lot to Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, is something else - an ensemble portrait that brings its characters alive without the script having to join the dots for us. Heading an impressive and mainly unknown cast is Aiden Gillen, from Queer As Fuck and Mojo, who continues to be one of the most compelling new faces on the British screen - whether brooding, smirking or silently brazening out the threats of a pub drunk. </p> <p>Lucia Zucchetti's editing is acutely tuned to those split seconds when characters reveal themselves through a tic or a faux pas. The Low Down is fresh and funny, and even a cute celeb cameo from TV jokers Adam and Joe fits in perfectly. </p> <p>It's not just realism that's on offer from the new contenders. Let's hope the new regime has room for eccentrics like Ben Hopkins, whose second feature, The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz, is a strange, misshapen, sometimes inspired oddity. Hopkins, who made the venturesome anomaly Simon Magus, indulges himself something rotten in a sparky micro-budget apocalyptic fantasy that suggests a hellish collision between Michael Moorcock, NF Simpson and the Jon Pertwee-era Dr Who. </p> <p>It is wayward and uneven, and I can't honestly say I liked it, yet there are occasional flashes of brilliance - such as the image of two security men watching thousands of video screens. At any rate, it's something of a miracle that an outsider like Hopkins is getting his visions on screen, and he is worth encouraging. If the right producer nudges him in the right direction, Hopkins's third, fourth or fifth film could well be extraordinary. </p> <p>\u0095 Last Resort plays tonight at Filmhouse 1. Box 0ffice: 0131-623 8030.</p>",

The sense of enclosure, as the digital black-and-white photography explores cramped apartments, bedrooms and offices, creates an uneasy intimacy that brings the characters vibrantly alive: by the end of it we know every crease on Trise's brow. The acting is uniformly superb, and while the film is socially engaged, it doesn't take the Ken Loach route of spelling things out for us. It's a moot point whether our film and TV industry currently has room for a hard-boiled case like Thomas - but it should. Another realist, already established, is Paul Pawlikowski, who made the BBC docudrama Twockers. But with Last Resort, written by Rowan Joffe, he has really arrived. Tanya (Dina Korzun), a young Russian mother, arrives in Britain with her young son and ends up consigned to a holding centre for asylum seekers - a desolate seaside resort that's like Butlins doubling as Kafka's Penal Colony, all hollowly ringing amusement arcades and fried fish that's pure batter. The film works brilliantly on several levels - as an intimately observed character piece, as a quasi-documentary expos\u00e9 on the conditions of life for asylum seekers and as an impressionistic depiction of our wretched cultural landscape, shot with an eye for poetic drabness by Ryszard Lenczewski. Korzun is a tender, affecting presence, but the scene-stealer - playing the seedy bingo caller who befriends Tanya - is Paddy Considine, who made his mark as the shell-suited maniac in Shane Meadows's A Room For Romeo Brass, and is shaping up to be a compulsive and natural player. A different kind of realism - funkier and lighter but still tough - comes in The Low Down. Superficially resembling the This Life school of drama, it has a gang of moderately groovy young urbanites experiencing love and other catastrophes in Hackney. But Jamie Thraves's film, shot and edited with a jumpy exuberance that owes a lot to Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, is something else - an ensemble portrait that brings its characters alive without the script having to join the dots for us. Heading an impressive and mainly unknown cast is Aiden Gillen, from Queer As Fuck and Mojo, who continues to be one of the most compelling new faces on the British screen - whether brooding, smirking or silently brazening out the threats of a pub drunk. Lucia Zucchetti's editing is acutely tuned to those split seconds when characters reveal themselves through a tic or a faux pas. The Low Down is fresh and funny, and even a cute celeb cameo from TV jokers Adam and Joe fits in perfectly. It's not just realism that's on offer from the new contenders. Let's hope the new regime has room for eccentrics like Ben Hopkins, whose second feature, The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz, is a strange, misshapen, sometimes inspired oddity. Hopkins, who made the venturesome anomaly Simon Magus, indulges himself something rotten in a sparky micro-budget apocalyptic fantasy that suggests a hellish collision between Michael Moorcock, NF Simpson and the Jon Pertwee-era Dr Who. It is wayward and uneven, and I can't honestly say I liked it, yet there are occasional flashes of brilliance - such as the image of two security men watching thousands of video screens. At any rate, it's something of a miracle that an outsider like Hopkins is getting his visions on screen, and he is worth encouraging. If the right producer nudges him in the right direction, Hopkins's third, fourth or fifth film could well be extraordinary. \u0095 Last Resort plays tonight at Filmhouse 1.

Despite the futuristic zeitgeist us new-millennium folks are supposed to be surfing, the champion of today's box office is just as likely to be wielding a Roman broadsword as a laser gun. Historical epics are back, and they're more epic than ever. More importantly, they're easier to make than ever. </p> <p>Ever since Jurassic Park, the blockbuster formula has been simple: old idea, new effects. Once the computer-generated image became an industry standard, all you needed to do was salvage a story from the sci-fi scrapheap (take your pick from dinosaurs, alien invaders, meteorites, natural disasters, killer sea creatures), slap on some \"state of the art\" effects, and laugh all the way to the bank. It's worked for the past decade or so, but in recent months, the formula has gone wrong as often as it has gone right. Brian de Palma's $90million space turkey Mission To Mars, for example, was a transparent attempt to feed us Kubrick's 2001 again, and no one bought it. Walter Hill's $70million shambles Supernova suffered a similar fate - aside from the novelty of zero-gravity sex scenes, it was basically Alien again. (At least Hill had the foresight to take his name off the picture, just as the studio had the foresight not to hold any preview screenings.) The forthcoming Pitch Black, while a substantial improvement in the originality stakes, still failed to set the US box office alight. And let's not go into Battlefield Earth. In fact, the most successful and imaginative sci-fi flicks of recent times have been Star Wars Episode I (call that new?), The Matrix (which, tellingly, had snappy new special effects) and Galaxy Quest, a sci-fi spoof. </p> <p>Like spoilt toddlers, audiences need new toys on a regular basis, and the more prescient industry players saw the ugly spectre of sci-fi fatigue rearing its head a long way off. They realised that the way forward was not forward at all. If computer power could be used to create those tired old sci-fi futures, why not use it to re-create the real-world past? Hey presto! Titanic! </p> <p>If former sci-fi diehard James Cameron could score big with a 90-year-old sinking ship, and win an armful of Oscars to boot, what else could be done? Spielberg ditched the dinos and went to war for Saving Private Ryan, and he came out with an Oscar too. French event-movie master Luc Besson tried next, but the tactic didn't quite pay off. His The Fifth Element was one of the best examples of the modern-day effects movie, despite one of the dumbest storylines ever committed to screen (goodies must stop baddies from destroying earth: they do). This year his ambition, and his faith in leading lady Milla Jovovich, got the better of him when he attempted to join the ranks of the \"serious\" directors with his own Gallic-flavoured historical epic, Joan Of Arc. And of course, leading this year's charge, sci-fi great Ridley Scott struck gold by going ancient for Gladiator. </p> <p>Where others had only hinted, Gladiator brazenly demonstrated that full-scale historical epics were viable again - and they hadn't been for more than a decade. The historical epic of yore required a cast of thousands, enormous sets, and pedantic historical accuracy. Big bucks, in other words, which was fine in Cecil B de Mille's day but became increasingly hazardous as time went on. There was so much to get wrong, and when it did go wrong the results were catastrophic. Ask Michael Cimino, who never really recovered from his $35million flop Heaven's Gate, or Hugh Hudson, who took down Goldcrest Films with his Al Pacino-starring 80s effort, Revolution. The failure of that civil war epic prompted critic Leonard Maltin to quip, \"Thanks to this megabomb, it'll be 2776 until we get another one.\" He was out by 776 years. </p> <p>There's no better indication of the turning tide than producer-director team Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. They gleefully rode the wave of sci-fi revamps with the chest-beating Independence Day, then they were forced to eat their slogan - \"size does matter\" - when their hulking entry into the big reptile market, Godzilla, came crashing to the ground (size doesn't matter, you fools, effects do). </p> <p>This year they scored big again by switching to the historical formula. No doubt encouraged by the knee-jerk patriotism which made Independence Day so popular in the States, they decided to simply make it again, this time based on the real independence day. Hence the Mel Gibson-starring civil war epic, The Patriot. Like the rest of the sci-fi defectors, Devlin and Emmerich recognised that computer animation has eliminated the risks which scuppered \"old-fashioned\" historical epics, and the two genres have become interchangeable. So why \"kick ET's butt\" when you can kick a child-murdering Limey's butt (with historical justification)? Why blow up an alien spaceship when you can blow up an 18th-century battleship just as easily? Why hire 1,500 extras for a battle scene when you can just dress up 50 and fill in the rest with a computer? Costs down, profits up, audiences happy. You might even win an Oscar. </p> <p>This week we're back in the Colosseum for another lavish sandal-fest, Julie Taymor's Shakespeare adaptation Titus. Although much of the production gloss is real rather than computer-rendered (the director was responsible for the stage version of The Lion King, after all), many of the same themes that made Gladiator so popular are present - power struggles and revenge tactics in ancient Rome, bloody combat with primitive weaponry, grand interiors and costumes, emperors with eye-shadow. Although its application is more subtle, computer rendering is still widely deployed: for the multi-layered dream sequences; for the plot's intermittent dismemberments (so difficult to achieve with the conventional long sleeves and false stumps); and for adding a Matrix-style, bullet-time zip to the climax. </p> <p>Titus is a particularly distinguished example of how the historical epic can be resurrected (ie with some restraint and intelligence), but the studio bean-counters are currently throwing millions of dollars at a new (computer) generation of these movies. The related world of swords-and-sorcery epics is due to come into play again soon, with game cash-in Dungeons And Dragons and Peter Jackson's hugely ambitious Lord Of The Rings trilogy in production (he's apparently using the whole of New Zealand as the set). In real history, there's Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer's second world war epic Pearl Harbor on the horizon, with Ben Affleck, Alec Baldwin and Kate Beckinsale among others, which already has the dubious distinction of being the most expensive movie since Titanic. </p> <p>If the historical craze continues, aside from making intellectually challenged movie moguls even more money, what will be the consequences for history? Perhaps movies will distort it beyond all resemblance to factual reality - after all, that's what movies do best. People will assume that all Romans had fringes and spoke English (some with Australian accents), that the British are the sole cause of evil and injustice in the world, that slaves enjoyed being classified as property and that the second world war was won single-handedly by the Americans (who defeated the British, of course). Perhaps they'll even forget that people used to make movies about spaceships and dinosaurs. Then we can start all over again. </p> <p>\u0095 Titus is out on Friday</p>",

A peculiar, offensive crew the last lot seemed, meanly confining themselves to a tripartite monotheism and denying the generosity of a Pantheon of gods. We haven't read anyone, save perhaps the late Rosemary Sutcliff, who has more persuasively imagined a way back into the alternative universe that was Rome, beyond the sex and the stinks and schisms, into an era when philosophical and moral ideas, since become commonplace, had not yet been thought through. </p> <p> <strong> Primitive Mythology</strong><br>Joseph Campbell <br>(Souvenir, \u00a312.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000065001,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>First of the republications of Campbell's four-vol Masks of God, his religious/psychological history of mankind. Not humanity; he means man-kind, women merely begetters of inspiration - it's all \"he for god only, she for god in him\", with divinity and rites of passage for blokes only. Campbell's masterwork was written in the 1950s, takes Freud as gospel, uses \"savage\" for \"primitive\", and \"primitive\" pejoratively. (No wonder he was the college favourite of new Hollywood directors of the 1970s: all action heroes, spiritual gurus, girls only for sex or mom-dom.)

A peculiar, offensive crew the last lot seemed, meanly confining themselves to a tripartite monotheism and denying the generosity of a Pantheon of gods. We haven't read anyone, save perhaps the late Rosemary Sutcliff, who has more persuasively imagined a way back into the alternative universe that was Rome, beyond the sex and the stinks and schisms, into an era when philosophical and moral ideas, since become commonplace, had not yet been thought through. Primitive Mythology Joseph Campbell (Souvenir, \u00a312.99) Buy it at BOL First of the republications of Campbell's four-vol Masks of God, his religious/psychological history of mankind. Not humanity; he means man-kind, women merely begetters of inspiration - it's all \"he for god only, she for god in him\", with divinity and rites of passage for blokes only. Campbell's masterwork was written in the 1950s, takes Freud as gospel, uses \"savage\" for \"primitive\", and \"primitive\" pejoratively. (No wonder he was the college favourite of new Hollywood directors of the 1970s: all action heroes, spiritual gurus, girls only for sex or mom-dom.) Yet he has inpired passages connecting with the luminously permanent, beyond gender, beyond time. The Grand Canyon Ansel Adams (Little, Brown \u00a318.99) The Campbell word we connect with is \"numinous\" - it means a commanding nod from the spirit of a place: and here are those spirits, specifically of the landscapes of the US Southwest, appearing to Adams's lens as they might not even to the most reverent eye.

And to write not one but several books about him in which distinctive bits of Britain's landscapes are bloodied with outlandish crimes.</p> <p>Or maybe it is cool rather than wacky. Elizabeth George is the Californian in question: she's been an Anglophile since a visit here as a teenager, and she's spent 15 years researching and writing crime novels featuring DI Thomas Lynley, aka the eighth Earl of Asherton, and his sidekick, Barbara Havers, a maverick detective sergeant who is as grainy as Lynley is polished. </p> <p>George's latest territorial conquest, in her new book, In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner, is the Peak District. But as well as trekking over large swathes of Derbyshire to get the topography, geography and folklore right for twin murders, she's burrowed into several boroughs of London for facts on everything from fast food (late-night consumption of) to kinky sex services (respectable businesses set up as covers for). </p> <p>So who is the mysterious Ms George? In composure and conversation, she's as carefully poised as an alibi. But she's not the expatriate granddaughter of Agatha Christie or Dorothy L Sayers (she admires both) writing about England from an eyrie overlooking the Pacific. It turns out that she's a schoolteacher who became a college academic, who became a full-time author. She applies an icy discipline to producing crime books so steeped in detail you'd swear she'd lived in the UK all her life - so long as you hadn't lived here yourself. </p> <p>A perverse literary enterprise, hers, creating a sort of Peter Wimsey of the Yard, when she could be updating Philip Marlowe. No way, says the self-possessed George. \"The English tradition offers the great tapestry novel, where you have the emotional aspect of a detective's personal life, the circumstances of the crime, and the atmosphere of the countryside which functions as another character.\" </p> <p>But why go to the trouble of mapping gorge and grange, tombs and tumuli, as she does for her Derbyshire backdrop? It's mostly because \"visiting the setting for me suggests so many turns in the plot\". But she adds: \"I write the kinds of novels I like to read, where the setting is rendered with love and care.\" She admires Martin Cruz Smith, whose literary locations - from Havana to 19th-century Wigan - are \"something I've always aspired to; not that I've come anywhere close\". </p> <p>That's not false modesty: George, a late starter who always felt she could write, is probably her own severest critic: she's frank about one or two of her books not being too good. But she does her homework with a relentless intensity. At the back of the new book, a list of experts are thanked for helping with her research into archery, 14th-century domestic architecture, mountain rescue, sado-masochism and lots more. </p> <p>However, there's a stubbornness alongside this fascination with detail. Some British readers remain irked that the Met should have Inspector Lynley, a member of the peerage, in its ranks. George says that that is less of a problem with American readers, who don't think it incongruous that someone with a title works for his living. And she points out that at least one peer is a provincial copper. </p> <p>But this cavil doesn't distract from her academic approach. The books, which used to be written in a few weeks, now take 15 months. And the research demands a couple of trips to the UK every year - she's just been sleuthing in Northumberland. </p> <p>George's creative process owes much to her discovery of John Steinbeck's Journal of a Novel, which he kept while writing East of Eden. \"I really liked the idea of creating a journal myself,\" she says. </p> <p>\"It's like the way I clear my throat. I write a page every day, maybe 500 words. It could be about something I'm specifically worried about in the new novel; it could be a question I want answered; it could be something that's going on in my personal life. I just use it as an exercise.\" </p> <p>Writing the journal is always preceded by reading one day's entry from the journal she kept while working on a previous book, to remind herself that she has faced - and overcome - similar blocks and doubts before; also, she says, it helps remove the loneliness of being a writer working alone. </p> <p>But before both of these exercises, there's a page or two to be read from either a classic (she recently finished Pride and Prejudice, which, she says, has ideally short chapters) or a book by a literary figure about the art of writing. It was the Steinbeck, of course, which set her on this track. </p> <p>These three elements in her routine take only 30 minutes. Then she's ready to continue with the book in hand: weaving a tapestry that, some critics say, contains writing that's almost too good for a detective novel. But for George, a perfectionist, it's always worth going the extra mile for a new location, or to a thesaurus to avoid a familiar word, or to enhance the rhythm of a sentence. So don't get impatient when you come across \"ensanguined\" in her new book, and wonder what's wrong with \"bloody\". The answer will be that she's used it the requisite number of times already.</p>",

But before both of these exercises, there's a page or two to be read from either a classic (she recently finished Pride and Prejudice, which, she says, has ideally short chapters) or a book by a literary figure about the art of writing. It was the Steinbeck, of course, which set her on this track. These three elements in her routine take only 30 minutes. Then she's ready to continue with the book in hand: weaving a tapestry that, some critics say, contains writing that's almost too good for a detective novel. But for George, a perfectionist, it's always worth going the extra mile for a new location, or to a thesaurus to avoid a familiar word, or to enhance the rhythm of a sentence. So don't get impatient when you come across \"ensanguined\" in her new book, and wonder what's wrong with \"bloody\". The answer will be that she's used it the requisite number of times already.",

Both these books are passionate, rousing defences of the appetite for excellence in a conformist, commercialised age. Far from being snobbish or high-handed, they remind me of the truth of Matthew Arnold's dictum that \"the men of culture are the true apostles of equality\". </p> <p>John Drummond's book is a polemical memoir charting his sometimes erratic ascent through British public life: BBC television's arts department in its golden age, the Edinburgh Festival, Controller of Radio 3 and director of the Proms. What strikes me is his genetic and environmental good luck. The son of a Scottish mariner and an Australian soprano, he inherited a quick intelligence, a restless curiosity, a phenomenal memory. </p> <p>Although brought up modestly in Bournemouth before moving on to the National Service Russian course and Cambridge, Drummond was part of a generation that experienced first-hand the post-war renewal of British artistic life: the Third Programme, cheap paperback books, susidised theatre, opera and ballet. Exactly like contemporaries such as John Tusa, Jeremy Isaacs and Joan Bakewell, he brought to broadcasting and public life firm values and a wide frame of cultural reference: a stark contrast to the modern media brats who seem to know nothing outside the narrow, goldfish-bowl world of television. </p> <p>Drummond was also endowed with the priceless gift of impatience: there's a hilarious moment in the book when a BBC superior apologises for saying of him in a report that \"he does not suffer fools gladly\". Drummond takes it as a compliment but is sternly told: \"Not in the BBC it's not.\"</p> <p>Among the many fools chastised in this book are bone-headed bureaucrats, egotistic conductors (Bernstein especially) and philistine politicians (headed by David Mellor and John Patten). But Drummond's b\u00eate noire is John Birt - for his assault on Reithian values, his reverence for overpaid consultants and his unbelievable management-speak. Asked by Drummond what he thought of BBC orchestras, Birt replied they were \"a variable resource centre whose viability depends on the business plan of the Controller of Radio 3\". </p> <p>Behind Drummond's testiness, however, lies a horror at the vandalisation of a once-great institution and a belief that those placed in positions of power, in broadcasting and the arts, have a mission to inform. Planning a series of architectural programmes for BBC Television, Drummond hired expert presenters such as Alec Clifton-Taylor, John Summerson and Mark Girouard: today, as he wearily says, it's more likely to be Janet Street-Porter.</p> <p>As director of the Edinburgh Festival, Drummond redressed the imbalance between music and drama and achieved thematic unity, as in his unsurpassed \"Vienna 1900\" year. And, as head of Radio 3, he constantly related the speech output to the music, though I'd question his drastic diminution of radio plays. </p> <p>Some might accuse Drummond of paternalism or even - to invoke the silliest of all words - elitism. But this shows the confusion of an age in which a proper scepticism about authority leads to a distrust of all professional knowledge and skill. Drummond, as a confessed generalist, readily admits that throughout life he has learned from people who know more than he does.</p> <p>What he has, as I can testify, is the ability to transmit his own enthusiasms. At one Edinburgh Festival he berated me for rigidly sticking, like all critics, to my own discipline: \"Go to some concerts and opera,\" he advised, \"and tell the Press Office I said so.\" I went that night to hear Simon Rattle conduct Stravinsky, Ravel and Faur\u00e9, and, though I wasn't exactly a musical innocent, I would say Drummond's exhortation changed my life: I have been haunting opera-houses and concert-halls ever since. And, at its best, what this invigorating roller-coaster of a book does, apart from settling old scores, is introduce you to composers who create new ones and remind you of the unending richness of what, with misplaced reverse snobbery, we crudely dub \"high art.\" </p> <p>Michael Kustow is cut from the same cloth as Drummond: having worked at different times for the RSC, the ICA, the National and Channel 4, he is a cultural impresario rather than a creator. His new, vital, vehemently argued book is partly an account of the hectic travails involved in bringing John Barton's epic 15-hour saga about the Trojan war, Tantalus, to theatrical fruition, and partly a highly personal apologia for theatre in an age of global capitalism, technology and cultural relativism. </p> <p>Kustow's book is full of wise saws and modern instances. He reminds us of Britain's debt to the amateur tradition of university drama - \"so rare in other countries\". He compares The Lion King to Inigo Jones's 17th-century masques in which pageantry replaced poetry. And, although his focus is ostensibly narrower than Drummond's, he sees the arts in a wider socio-political context: he not only assails Thatcherite market-driven madness but attends an IT conference in Amsterdam, where he discovers that \"play, the very soil of theatre, is being appropriated by a new breed of designers and gamesters\". </p> <p>What is heartening is that neither of these two books, finally, is apocalyptic. Kustow ends with a richly descriptive and highly moving account of Ariane Mnouchkine's Paris production of Drums on the Dam that embodies the mix of intoxicating theatricality and urgent actuality in which he strongly believes.

They write about themselves, the short-lived experiences of the individual, the search for identity within a diverse, ever-mutating culture. Sex, drugs, and techno are never far away. </p> <p>Benjamin von Stuckrad-Barre is perhaps the leader of the group. His novel, Soloalbum (1998), uses Oasis song-titles as a structuring device in a brash novel about relationships, losing weight, and a quest to become as cool as \"Pop-land\" (England). The follow-up, Livealbum, is the author's diary of a reading-tour around Germany.</p> <p>Travelogue-fictions are emblematic of this fast-moving group. Christan Kracht's Faserland (punning on fatherland; with Faser meaning thread) unravels a route from north to south that starts at Sylt, an island in the North Sea, and finishes in his native Switzerland, calling in at Hamburg and Heidelberg. Such frivolous tales of European displacement do not attempt to compete with the profound musings on emigration, history and memory in the work of W G Sebald, who has a studied regard for literary tradition. Kracht is more interested in a coruscating wit. </p> <p>The Irvine Welsh of the movement is Rainald Goetz, author of the well-received play, Jeff Koons, and the novel, Rave. He has two pieces in Nightdrive (1995), an anthology of modern German short stories in translation, a useful if somewhat uneven introduction. </p> <p>However, not all younger writers subscribe to this spirit of sensationalism. Thomas Lehr's Nabokov's Katze (Nabokov's Cat, due to be translated next year), is an elegant novel that strives for the flair of the great stylist. Similarly well-crafted is Meine nachtblaue Hosen (My Night-blue Trousers) by David Wagner, which tells the simple tale of a rural childhood. </p> <p>Yet the more interesting work, in terms of content, follows a familiar theme in German-language fiction: migration. Originally from East Germany, Michael Schindhelm, in his novel Robert's Reise (Robert's Journey), looks at East Berlin and Leipzig and the \"new experience\" since reunification. </p> <p>So significant is the number of women readers in Germany that the most influential reviews are published fortnightly in the women's magazine, Brigitte. Among the important writers, there is Judith Hermann, whose collection of short stories, Sommerhaus, Spoter, created a big impression with its clipped prose and gentle wisdom. Meanwhile, Pieke Biermann's translated crime novel, Violetta (Serpent's Tail), is set in Berlin just after reunification. </p> <p>Embracing writers from Austria, Switzerland and elsewhere, literature in German has always been European in outlook. Elfriede Jelinek is one of Austria's best-known women writers and playwrights. She once declared her country \"a criminal nation\" for its role in Nazi war crimes, and when Haider was elected, she withdrew her plays from the theatre. Her novels include The Piano Teacher, a provocative analysis of an intense mother-daughter relationship, and Wonderful, Wonderful Times (both Serpent's Tail), a satire of provincial Austrians plagued by their war-crime culpability. </p> <p>Another major Austrian novelist and playwright is Thomas Bernhard. Cutting Timber (1984) is a viciously funny satire of cultural life in Vienna. Boasting \"the Viennese Virgina Woolf\" and revolving around two very Woolfian scenes - a dinner party and a funeral - the book sends up affluent dilettantes in post-Imperial, post-Nazi Austria. </p> <p>Perhaps the best-known Austrian author is Peter Handke, whose experimental novels such as The Left-Handed Woman (1976), a dystopian vision of suburban Austria, have established his reputation as one of the most interesting writers of his generation. </p> <p>Of the Swiss writers, Robert Walser provides a spirited and unusual read. Institute Benjamenta (1909) is an allegorical novel set in a school for servants, full of odd and engaging characters, while The Walk and other Stories (1917) is a collection of 42 pieces that marvel at the joys of landscape, rambling, and eccentricity. </p> <p>It's impossible to ignore some of the great novels of the last century. Of those concerned with the war and its aftermath, Heinrich Boll's The Clown (1963) unmasks the guilt in 1950s Cologne, while Erich Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (1929) is a perennial anti-war bestseller. Also popular is the Gunner Ash Trilogy by Hans Hellmut Kirst. </p> <p>Boll's most famous book, though, is The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum (1974), a parody of the German tabloid press, and of public life in West Germany in the 1960s and 1970s. </p> <p>Gunter Grass's Gdansk/ Danzig trilogy, of which The Tin Drum (1959) is the best-known volume, is a vibrant mix of magic realism, social commentary and mischief-making. The Tin Drum itself is a rhythmic 600-page history of the Polish city and its people, a paean to a lost homeland. You only have to read Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children to see the book's influence on world literature. </p> <p>There are many great modernist tomes (Mann, Musil, and Broch among them), but literature in German has also been remarkable for the short form: the story, the fragment, the poem. Berthold Brecht's Short Stories brings together typically perverse, and strangely affecting pieces written while the author was living in Bavaria, Berlin and, during 1933 and 1948, in exile. Brecht's poems are not too bad either. And if you haven't yet read Czech-born Kafka's Metamorphoses and other Stories, perhaps it's time. </p> <p>Rainer Maria Rilke's poetry is available in very fine translations by Stephen Cohn, while Diaries of a Young Poet compiles the journals Rilke kept while living in Florence, Schmargendorf (Berlin), and Worpswede (near Bremen, north Germany). They offer an abundance of lucid thoughts and sensual descriptions. As the great German thinker Theodor Adorno wrote, when you have nowhere to go, writing becomes a place to live.</p>",

The official version is that Emil Jellinek, the Austrian consul-general in Nice, used Mercedes - his 11-year-old daughter's first name - as a pseudonym when he drove a Daimler in a race in France in 1899. </p> <p>He then ordered 36 Daimlers - a quarter of the German company's annual output - on condition that he got the sole agency rights for Austro-Hungary, France and the United States and was able to sell the vehicle under the Mercedes name. </p> <p>Gottlieb Daimler, a baker's son who founded the Daimler motor company in 1890, agreed to the strange deal. Jellinek paid for the vehicles with 550,000 gold marks. Less official sources, however, claim that Jellinek's decision to use the Mercedes name was to get round the exclusive rights to sell Daimlers in France held by French car company Panhard. </p> <p>Jellinek wanted a car he could race, and Daimler came up with the four cylinder Phoenix 35. Only five were made. The one preserved at the company museum in Stuttgart won the Nice Mountain Race in 1902 and later spent 31 years powering a circular saw in England before being restored to its former glory. </p> <p>By 1902 Mercedes had become a legally-protected trade name for vehicles made by Daimler. A year later Daimler and Jellinek set up a company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mercedes, based in Paris. Five years later Jellinek owned a Mercedes coach which he used to take his family on holiday. He changed his name to Jellinek-Mercedes. </p> <p>Gottlieb Daimler invented the high speed combustion engine with his chief engineer, Wilhelm Maybach, and made his first car in 1886, the same year in which Karl Benz patented the motorised tricycle regarded as the mother of all cars. </p> <p>The companies they founded were ri vals for more than 30 years. They promoted their vehicles by entering them in the road races of the day. Daimler did not live to see the success of Mercedes.

There were more than 80 car makers. Daimler and Benz eventually merged in 1926 to form Daimler-Benz, now known as DaimlerChrysler following its \u00a355bn merger with Chrysler in 1998. Its Mercedes-Benz unit concentrated on cars. In the mid 1930s it introduced a successful racing car known as the Silver Arrow because initially its white paintwork had to be sanded off so it could meet racing weight limits. </p> <p>Fans of Mercedes' sporty cars were surprised when the company launched a rather staid-looking vehicle, the 170, in 1931. But the popularity of the car and its cheaper sister, the 170V, with their independent front and rear suspension, was a kiss of life for the company during and immediately after the second world war. About 100,000 of the 170V models were sold, outselling any previous model made by the company. </p> <p>Like other big German companies, forced labour was used at many of its plants during the war.

      "body": "<p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, has agreed to delay new rules governing the right of employers to monitor their employees' personal emails in the face of widespread criticism of the legislation by business leaders. </p> <p>Ministers had previously insisted that the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which will govern all email and telephone surveillance, must be in place before the Human Rights Act comes into force on October 2. </p> <p>The proposed regulations require all public authorities and private companies to get the consent of both the sender and the receiver of emails, voice mails and other messages before they conduct any monitoring, with only a handful of specific exceptions. </p> <p>However, business groups have warned that these constraints on business monitoring of emails could leave firms vulnerable to legal action by employees claiming their right to privacy had been breached. This in turn could force firms to avoid such risks by banning their staff from sending any personal emails. </p> <p>The existing rules for in-house company surveillance have already been successfully challenged in the European Court of Human Rights. </p> <p>Ministers hope the new law will avoid a spate of similar challenges against government departments and other public sector employers under the new human rights legislation. </p> <p>Although the business surveillance law has already received royal assent, the Department of Trade and Industry has agreed to extend the consultation period on the proposed surveillance rules, which had been due to end yesterday, by a further three weeks following criticism from businesss organisations. </p> <p>The rules will now come into force on October 24, when an EU directive concerning email privacy also comes into force. </p> <p>Yesterday the Alliance for Electronic Business (AEB), which includes the Confederation of British Industry, issued a response to the DTI's consultation paper condemning the rules as \"totally impractical and indeed impossible\" to comply with. </p> <p>The AEB called on the government to introduce entirely new rules which would allow companies the right to blanket monitor all employees without consent, except in \"specifically excluded\" cases. </p> <p>This proposal was condemned by the Trade Unions Congress and civil liberty campaigners as \"completely unacceptable\". </p> <p>A spokesman for the Home Office said public sector employers, who have a direct duty to abide by the Human Rights Act, had already been advised of the risk of a human rights challenge.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, has agreed to delay new rules governing the right of employers to monitor their employees' personal emails in the face of widespread criticism of the legislation by business leaders. Ministers had previously insisted that the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which will govern all email and telephone surveillance, must be in place before the Human Rights Act comes into force on October 2. The proposed regulations require all public authorities and private companies to get the consent of both the sender and the receiver of emails, voice mails and other messages before they conduct any monitoring, with only a handful of specific exceptions. However, business groups have warned that these constraints on business monitoring of emails could leave firms vulnerable to legal action by employees claiming their right to privacy had been breached. This in turn could force firms to avoid such risks by banning their staff from sending any personal emails. The existing rules for in-house company surveillance have already been successfully challenged in the European Court of Human Rights. Ministers hope the new law will avoid a spate of similar challenges against government departments and other public sector employers under the new human rights legislation. Although the business surveillance law has already received royal assent, the Department of Trade and Industry has agreed to extend the consultation period on the proposed surveillance rules, which had been due to end yesterday, by a further three weeks following criticism from businesss organisations. The rules will now come into force on October 24, when an EU directive concerning email privacy also comes into force. Yesterday the Alliance for Electronic Business (AEB), which includes the Confederation of British Industry, issued a response to the DTI's consultation paper condemning the rules as \"totally impractical and indeed impossible\" to comply with. The AEB called on the government to introduce entirely new rules which would allow companies the right to blanket monitor all employees without consent, except in \"specifically excluded\" cases. This proposal was condemned by the Trade Unions Congress and civil liberty campaigners as \"completely unacceptable\". A spokesman for the Home Office said public sector employers, who have a direct duty to abide by the Human Rights Act, had already been advised of the risk of a human rights challenge.",

      "body": "<p>According to many, the Anglican church is in crisis. According to some, it is in terminal decline. Many of the some are Catholics, and some of them are reacting with neighbourly concern. Others among them are reacting with glee. But gleeful Catholics could start by putting their own house in order; if their Anglican neighbours are having a bit of a domestic, dry rot is silently eroding their own floorboards.</p> <p>The current Anglican crisis is one of authority, or rather a perceived lack of unifying authority. As numbers decline, the prospect is of a broad church broadening to ruin, with the centre failing to hold. Contradictory beliefs about legitimate ministry and core Christian ethics threaten to fragment province, diocese and parish.</p> <p>You can pick your own catalyst for this disunity, from a menu which offers the decision to ordain women priests, any refusal to declare homosexual activity sinful, and creeping secular liberalism, as espoused by Bishops Spong, Holloway, Jenkins - or whoever your preferred demon happens to be.</p> <p>Whatever the contributory factors, symptoms of disunity abound. Perhaps the most glaring is the consecration in Singapore in February of two bishops bound for a ministry to American conservatives.

      "bodyText": "According to many, the Anglican church is in crisis. According to some, it is in terminal decline. Many of the some are Catholics, and some of them are reacting with neighbourly concern. Others among them are reacting with glee. But gleeful Catholics could start by putting their own house in order; if their Anglican neighbours are having a bit of a domestic, dry rot is silently eroding their own floorboards. The current Anglican crisis is one of authority, or rather a perceived lack of unifying authority. As numbers decline, the prospect is of a broad church broadening to ruin, with the centre failing to hold. Contradictory beliefs about legitimate ministry and core Christian ethics threaten to fragment province, diocese and parish. You can pick your own catalyst for this disunity, from a menu which offers the decision to ordain women priests, any refusal to declare homosexual activity sinful, and creeping secular liberalism, as espoused by Bishops Spong, Holloway, Jenkins - or whoever your preferred demon happens to be. Whatever the contributory factors, symptoms of disunity abound. Perhaps the most glaring is the consecration in Singapore in February of two bishops bound for a ministry to American conservatives. This was done over the heads of both the Archbishop of Canterbury and the US church leadership. Such developments have led to some Catholics claiming (more in joy than in sorrow) that ecumenism is now indefinitely postponed; they mean dead, but are not allowed to say so. The argument is that a unified choir cannot rehearse with sundry visitors who each brandish a different hymn sheet. As a Catholic myself, I am more troubled by my church's current note of superiority than I believe Anglicans should be by their own discordant notes.

The company, which made a profit of \u00a32.9bn last year, said it was being forced to increase fees because the growing use of mobile phones was making its phone boxes less viable. But campaigners for the poor and elderly warned that the move would marginalise thousands of people who do not have access to a phone at home or a mobile. Under the new charges, to come into force on October 3, the 10p minimum fee which has been in force since 1984 will be scrapped in favour of a 20p basic charge.

What annoys you most? Being in a queue of any sort. How do you relax? Running and gardening. What was your last cultural experience? Peter Grimes at Glyndebourne. What is your favourite city? Manchester, but Cheltenham would be my favourite \"town\" and Santa Monica in California my \"world city\". Do you have a favourite website? It changes every week - this week it was a cool site by web design team Mook. What is your greatest regret? My greatest regret is always when pressure of work makes you selfish and insensitive - it happens too often.",

But Mr Murray says Carl will take this opportunity to try and persuade ministers to remove leasehold status from the statute books altogether.",

Her estranged husband kept his copy, and yesterday Julian St Quinton, 33, a butcher from Easington, East Yorkshire, was found guilty of blackmail with menaces.</p> <p>Details of the couple's sex life unfolded at Hull crown court. They had enjoyed group sex on at least eight occasions with a couple met through a contact magazine. Once, they were joined by another man. She also posed with a woman for pictures that her husband sent to the readers' wives section of Escort magazine.</p> <p>After the verdict, Judge Tom Cracknell said blackmail usually meant jail; he adjourned sentence to a later date.</p> <p>St Quinton denied the charge and told the court that he kept the video, a seven-hour compilation, to remind him of \"an enjoyable time in his life\", but the jurors found he had used it to make Ms Stone, 26, give up her claim to half of their \u00a3100,000 home.</p> <p>In an acrimonious divorce, he threatened to send the tape to her parents, Linda and Trevor Stone, and to the colleagues of her father, millionaire owner of a timber firm.</p> <p>At one point in the five-day trial St Quinton alleged Linda Stone had been keen on him and had performed a sex act on him in her kitchen - a claim that her daughter dismissed.</p> <p>Ms Stone, a secretary from Roos near Hull, said her husband phoned her threatening to release the video. She went to police after an anonymous call from a woman who said: \"Get your solicitors to back off. I know what he's got. I have seen the video.\"</p> <p>She wept as she told the court she now viewed the group sex with revulsion, although at the time she had agreed; when she drank a lot of alcohol, she lost her inhibitions. \"He never held a gun to my head.

      "bodyText": "When her marriage ended, Samantha Stone destroyed her copy of a video of her enjoying group sex. Her estranged husband kept his copy, and yesterday Julian St Quinton, 33, a butcher from Easington, East Yorkshire, was found guilty of blackmail with menaces. Details of the couple's sex life unfolded at Hull crown court. They had enjoyed group sex on at least eight occasions with a couple met through a contact magazine. Once, they were joined by another man. She also posed with a woman for pictures that her husband sent to the readers' wives section of Escort magazine. After the verdict, Judge Tom Cracknell said blackmail usually meant jail; he adjourned sentence to a later date. St Quinton denied the charge and told the court that he kept the video, a seven-hour compilation, to remind him of \"an enjoyable time in his life\", but the jurors found he had used it to make Ms Stone, 26, give up her claim to half of their \u00a3100,000 home. In an acrimonious divorce, he threatened to send the tape to her parents, Linda and Trevor Stone, and to the colleagues of her father, millionaire owner of a timber firm. At one point in the five-day trial St Quinton alleged Linda Stone had been keen on him and had performed a sex act on him in her kitchen - a claim that her daughter dismissed. Ms Stone, a secretary from Roos near Hull, said her husband phoned her threatening to release the video. She went to police after an anonymous call from a woman who said: \"Get your solicitors to back off. I know what he's got. I have seen the video.\" She wept as she told the court she now viewed the group sex with revulsion, although at the time she had agreed; when she drank a lot of alcohol, she lost her inhibitions. \"He never held a gun to my head. I knew what I was doing. I did it to keep him happy. I craved love from him, but he didn't show me any.\" They had met when she was 16. Within two years of getting married in 1993 he suggested they have group sex, which he often filmed. They separated in 1997, and she later moved in with another man. St Quinton admitted showing the video to two girlfriends and to his brothers, but his defence lawyer described him as a fool and braggart who had showed off the video only to regain a status he thought he had lost when his wife left him. He was visibly shaken at the jury's verdict. In a statement outside court, Mr and Mrs Stone said they were delighted with the verdict: \"Our love for each other has never been stronger, and we utterly refute [sic] Julian St Quinton's allegations.\" Residents of Easington, a hamlet with three pubs and a 12th century church, were shocked to hear what had been going on.

Jackie Coulter, a prominent member of the UDA and close associate of the convicted terrorist Johnny Adair, was shot in the head as he sat in a Land Rover Discovery by a lone gunman from the rival Ulster Volunteer Force on Monday. His was the second funeral in north Belfast in two days: Bobby Mahood, who was killed in the same attack as Coulter, was buried yesterday, while Sam Rocket, 22, a man with links to the UVF who was shot dead in retaliation on Wednesday night, will be laid to rest today. Coulter's wife Agnes, son Jackie and daughters Tracey, Natalie and Amy walked behind the coffin as it made its way to the spot outside a bookmakers on the Crumlin Road where the UDA man was killed.

      "body": "<p>The German intelligence service took the highly unusual step yesterday of confirming a report that it had found a secret missile-production facility in Iraq.</p> <p>The tabloid daily, Bild Zeitung, had placed the plant 25 miles south-west of Baghdad in the \"al-Mamoun\" factory.</p> <p>The report was the latest of several based on western intelligence assessments suggesting that the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, has rebuilt his missile-production capability far more swiftly than expected. After British and American war planes struck at 12 military factories in 1998, the allies claimed to have set back Iraq's missile programme by several years.</p> <p>But last month the New York Times reported that Baghdad had resumed building and flight-testing ballistic missiles. American officials said US spy satellites and aircraft monitoring the \"no-fly\" zones over northern and southern Iraq had detected seven test flights in the 12 months to the end of June.</p> <p>Iraq described the article as an attempt to divert attention from the issue of sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But it did not deny the report.</p> <p>Bild said that about 250 technicians were working at the al-Mamoun plant, producing a solid-fuel, short-range weapon called the Ababil-100. A spokeswoman for the Bundesnachrichtendienst, the German federal intelligence service, said: \"We can confirm that the report is substantially correct.\"</p> <p>The paper said the Ababil-100 had a range of less than 150 kilometres (about 90 miles), and thus did not breach UN restrictions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf war in 1991. Iraq is known to be keen to enhance its air-defence systems to strike at British and US pilots enforcing the UN's no-fly zones.</p> <p>But German and other western security experts have expressed concern that building and testing short-range missiles could herald a move towards establishing a longer-range capability.</p> <p>Bild also reported that Germany's secret service had unearthed evidence that President Saddam's scientists were working on plans for weapons that could travel up to 3,000 kilometres (1,865 miles), which would allow Baghdad to hit targets in western Europe.</p> <p>Anthony Zinni, the US commander in the Gulf, sounded a similar warning last month, when he told the New York Times that short-range missile technology was \"transferable to longer-range missiles\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The German intelligence service took the highly unusual step yesterday of confirming a report that it had found a secret missile-production facility in Iraq. The tabloid daily, Bild Zeitung, had placed the plant 25 miles south-west of Baghdad in the \"al-Mamoun\" factory. The report was the latest of several based on western intelligence assessments suggesting that the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, has rebuilt his missile-production capability far more swiftly than expected. After British and American war planes struck at 12 military factories in 1998, the allies claimed to have set back Iraq's missile programme by several years. But last month the New York Times reported that Baghdad had resumed building and flight-testing ballistic missiles. American officials said US spy satellites and aircraft monitoring the \"no-fly\" zones over northern and southern Iraq had detected seven test flights in the 12 months to the end of June. Iraq described the article as an attempt to divert attention from the issue of sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But it did not deny the report. Bild said that about 250 technicians were working at the al-Mamoun plant, producing a solid-fuel, short-range weapon called the Ababil-100. A spokeswoman for the Bundesnachrichtendienst, the German federal intelligence service, said: \"We can confirm that the report is substantially correct.\" The paper said the Ababil-100 had a range of less than 150 kilometres (about 90 miles), and thus did not breach UN restrictions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf war in 1991. Iraq is known to be keen to enhance its air-defence systems to strike at British and US pilots enforcing the UN's no-fly zones. But German and other western security experts have expressed concern that building and testing short-range missiles could herald a move towards establishing a longer-range capability. Bild also reported that Germany's secret service had unearthed evidence that President Saddam's scientists were working on plans for weapons that could travel up to 3,000 kilometres (1,865 miles), which would allow Baghdad to hit targets in western Europe. Anthony Zinni, the US commander in the Gulf, sounded a similar warning last month, when he told the New York Times that short-range missile technology was \"transferable to longer-range missiles\".",

Ms Megawati's acceptance of the additional responsibilities quashed mounting speculation that she had fallen out with Mr Wahid and was about to resign. But analysts and the financial markets remain sceptical about how effective she and a new, slimmed-down, cabinet will be in solving Indonesia's deepening social and economic crises. In a decree signed on Wednesday but made pubic only yesterday, Mr Wahid, 60, gave Ms Megawati, 54, authority to set cabinet agendas and chair the weekly meetings, review ministers' performance and appoint senior bureaucrats, police and military officers. She will also liaise between government agencies and take charge of disseminating policy to the public. \"In order to increase the effectiveness of the government, it is necessary to task the vice-president to help the president in his duty, especially in technical day-to-day [matters],\" said the decree, which runs until the end of Mr Wahid's term in 2004. Mr Wahid, who is almost blind, has had two strokes and has diabetes, decided to transfer duties to Ms Megawati after his handling of the government since taking office last October was roundly criticised by a special parliamentary session earlier this month. He has said that he will now concentrate on foreign policy, national unity and humanitarian affairs. The decree left many questions unanswered because much of it was vague. Furthermore all major decisions will still require Mr Wahid's approval as he did not cede any formal power to his deputy. Ms Megawati is expected to work closely with the two coordinating ministers for politics and the economy that Mr Wahid appointed to the cabinet, which was cut from 35 ministers to 26. The new team is being dubbed All the President's Men because Indonesia's two largest political parties, Ms Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) and the former ruling Golkar party, have surprisingly been virtually excluded. Ms Megawati was so angry at the PDIP not being given any key portfolios that she boycotted the announcement of the new team. Sutjipto, deputy head of PDIP, which has a near fanatical following among much of Indonesia's masses, said Ms Megawati then seriously considered quitting before deciding that \"the desolation of this republic will be unimaginable if I resigned\". News of that decision buoyed Jakarta's bearish financial markets but no one is expecting a significant rally in the coming weeks until Ms Megawati, who has no formal managerial experience, and the cabinet prove themselves. For the past three days, Indonesia's outspoken legislators and media have largely rubbished the new team, saying that the ministers are unlikely to prove any better than their predecessors. Criticism has focused on the facts that many ministers have retained jobs when wholesale change was expected and that several of the newcomers are considered unworthy of being ministers. Singled out is the new finance minister, Prijadi Praptosuhardjo, a banker and close confidant of Mr Wahid who recently failed a \"fit-and-proper\" test when the president nominated him to be chairman of one of the country's largest state banks.",

      "bodyText": "Britain was preparing itself for the grand finale to the outdoor music festival season this bank holiday weekend as millions of people headed for concert venues across the country to dance away the final days of their summer break. The AA yesterday estimated some 15m car journeys would be made over the long weekend as music fans make for the Notting Hill carnival in west London, the Reading festival in Berkshire, Creamfields dance music event near Liverpool, and the Chelmsford Spectacular in Essex. Tomorrow and on Monday, 1m people a day are expected to squeeze on to the three-mile Notting Hill carnival route that snakes around the streets of the west London district. Steel and soca bands will provide the musical accompaniment as 40,000 masqueraders parade through the biggest street party in Europe. Radio 1 rap DJ Tim Westwood, who missed out on last year's carnival after he was shot in a drive-by shooting in south London, will be making a comeback. The run-up to this year's carnival has not been entirely free from racism. The Metropolitan police said it was investigating a series of menacing letters sent to organisers. A spokesman said: \"The community safety unit at Notting Hill is investigating a number of malicious communications sent to various addresses in the London area regarding the Notting Hill carnival.\" He added that there would be no change in policing tactics and there would be just 8,000 officers at the event. A spokeswoman for the carnival said: \"We have got quite a lot of malicious mail over the years and we always treat it seriously. The latest letter arrived a couple of weeks ago and we handed it straight to the police.\" However, the carnival will see its first police-sponsored float, featuring around 120 dancers and two 7ft cutout meercats which will be highlighting the Met's neighbourhood watch schemes. Meanwhile, the meteorological office recommended that those at Reading rock festival should brace themselves for a downpour today. \"It will be rather cloudy with heavy showers or thundery storms across much of Britain on Saturday,\" a spokesman said. \"But Sunday and Monday should be fine and dry with increasing amounts of sunshine and only a 10% chance of showers.\" But yesterday afternoon 70,000 rock fans had already pitched their tents and were enjoying temperatures of 27\u00b0C. The rock festival is being held in tandem with a twin event in Leedsay at Leeds over the weekend. Around 40,000 people are also expected at Liverpool's old airfield today for the Creamfields dance music festival. In Chelmsford, the three-day Spectacular 2000 festival begins with pop band Steps as tonight's headline act in Hylands Park. Tomorrow evening the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra will give a proms concert in the park, and Monday will be a 1960s and 1970s nostalgia evening. Further north, comedian Billy Connolly will today be hosting a highland games event at his Candacraig estate in Aberdeenshire. American comedian Robin Williams is expected to be among the celebrity guests.",

When Mr Clinton toured Africa in 1998, he avoided Nigeria because it was still under the kind of military leadership that had destabilised the country over the previous three decades. Since 1998, the country has moved from a military government to democracy under president Olusegun Obasanjo, initially a military leader but elected as a civilian leader last year. There is much still amiss in Nigeria, with high levels of corruption and notoriety as a regional centre for drug trafficking. The return of democracy too has been turbulent, with parliamentarians regularly criticising Mr Obasanjo over lack of vigour in fighting corruption. But it is a sign of the growing strength of democracy within Nigeria that its parliamentarians can feel free enough to engage the leadership in such a way.</p> <p>The main importance of the new Nigeria for Mr Clinton is regional security. Mr Obasanjo is spending much time abroad: too much, say some of his critics, who would like to see him concentrate on the many domestic problems, such as the spiralling religious tensions in the north. But he has succeeded in making Nigeria the main regional power in central Africa, playing a role as a peace-keeper in the civil wars in Sierra Leone and the Congo and as an intermediary with Liberia's meddlesome president, Charles Taylor. Mr Obasanjo was praised by the British government yesterday for his efforts in trying to secure the release of the Channel Four crew held in Liberia.</p> <p>His influence is being felt further afield. He has emerged as one of the leaders of the developing world. He was in London this week helping to reshape the Group of 77. This organisation has grown to represent 133 developing countries, from an unwieldy, amorphous body into a streamlined body that will demand attention at the international forums dominated by the industrialised West. Its main targets are the World Trade Organisation and the IMF.</p> <p>Mr Obasanjo is well on the way to providing the kind of role which we became used to Nelson Mandela playing in Africa. While nowhere near having the moral authority of Mr Mandela, he has lifted Nigeria from being one of the pariah states of the world to a regional power and one of the leading lights of the developing world. It is in recognition of this leap that Mr Clinton is in Nigeria today.</p>",

In the town of Nandyal, about 120 miles south of Hyderabad, one of the worst hit areas, helicopters rescued 53 people from the roof of a bus which had been swept into a river, and one plucked 15 others from a tree. Less than three months ago millions of Indians were suffering from one of the worst droughts in the country's history: fields turned to dust, wells ran dry and villagers prayed for rain. Now the rains have come and brought more suffering. Half a year's average rainfall poured down on Hyderabad in one day this week. Since the monsoon began in June, sweeping south from Assam in the north-east, more than 400 have died and 5m have been affected in India. More have suffered in Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. With the rain has come disease. In Assam, which ranks as one of the world's wettest regions, at least 38 people, many sheltering in refugee camps, have died in the past fortnight from gastroenteritis. Stagnant pools of flood water are quickly breeding mosquitoes, which carry malaria. Farmers had just planted their rice seedlings, but now more than 200,000 hectares (495,000 acres) of crops have been damaged. Many people have complained of the slow pace of medical aid and are struggling to find clean drinking water. The price of firewood, needed to boil water clean, has soared in local shops. Some are using improvised filters of sand and rocks. \"For the past three weeks no government doctors have visited us and we are left to survive on our own. Many people in my village are suffering from high fever and dysentery,\" said Binoy Chandra Rabha, a villager in Chayyagaon, close to Guwahati, 70 miles south of the border with Bhutan. The International Federation of the Red Cross has appealed for $3.5m (\u00a32.4m) to help India's flood victims. \"There are certain things that can be done,\" its local spokesman, Patrick Fuller, said. \"But it is very hard to hold back the elements.\"",

Kray was sentenced to serve not less than 30 years for the murder of McVitie, who was stabbed to death in a flat in Stoke Newington, north London. Reggie Kray's twin Ronnie, the other half of Britain's most notorious gangster duo, received the same sentence in 1969 for two murders. Ronnie, who died of a heart attack in 1995, was convicted of the murder of George Cornell, shot in the Blind Beggar pub in east London. He was also convicted of McVitie's murder.",

The four men, who were making a three-part documentary, were detained last Friday and charged on Monday with helping British and US intelligence to support allegations that Liberia was assisting rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone by diamond smuggling and gun running. Interviewed on CNN, Mr Taylor said their release was the result of \"plea bargaining\" between government lawyers and defence counsel. \"We are not expelling the journalists but they are free to leave whenever they want,\" he said. The journalists - British director David Barrie, Zimbabwe-born cameraman Tim Lambon, who has dual South African and British nationality, Sorious Samura from Sierra Leone, and South African soundman Gugulakhe Radebe - were expected to fly out of the capital Monrovia to Abidjan on the Ivory Coast. Under the Liberian penal code they could have faced 10 years in prison or, according to the indictment, the death penalty. Their release was welcomed by the foreign secretary Robin Cook as \"an enormous relief for the men's families\". Mr Cook said that he would be thanking President Ob-asanjo of Nigeria; Nelson Mandela; Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's envoy to Africa; and the Sierra Leone ambassador to Liberia for their efforts.

The phenomenal growth in Japanese restaurants and noodle bars - backed up by a burgeoning takeaway trade - has helped to trigger a supermarket boom in sushi sales. Sainsbury's yesterday opened its first in-store sushi bar - and at least three more are planned this year - to complement a big increase in its range of Japanese-style foods. What started four years ago as a small niche product line, sold only in London and the south-east, is now available in more than 200 branches - and it is outselling cheese sandwiches. Supermarket rival Tesco sells \u00a37m worth of sushi a year as part of what is rapidly becoming a mass-market phenomenon as Britons' taste for both exotic and healthy fishy food, which has made the Japanese the longest-living people on earth, helps to create a new eating fashion. The new Sainsbury's sushi bar, at the Cromwell Road branch in Kensington, includes a conveyor belt from which customers can choose a selection of sushi. \"Sales seem to show people are buying it for dinners and parties,\" said a spokeswoman.

      "bodyText": "The Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has again defied the military junta by attempting to travel outside the capital, Rangoon. She was halted by the police on Thursday in a suburb of the city after crossing the river. Her convoy of two small vehicles was moved to a side road and blocked by two trucks. It remained there overnight. The government claimed that officials had asked her not to proceed further \"for security reasons\". Police and plainclothes agents were at the scene yesterday morning and an ambulance stood by. The new confrontation comes after a year of dangerous stalemate in which official threats have been made to execute Ms Suu Kyi, or imprison her for life for \"high treason\". This is the first time that the Nobel prizewinner has challenged her travel restrictions since 1998, when she was frustrated in four such efforts to leave the capital to meet supporters of her National League for Democracy party (NLD). A spokesman for the NLD, which is regularly harassed by the authorities, said yesterday that Ms Suu Kyi was trying to meet members of the party's youth wing in Kungyangon, about 30 miles south of Rangoon. In May this year the Burmese army newspaper the Mirror warned that Ms Suu Kyi and her followers were liable to execution or life imprisonment for committing high treason by having contact with dissidents. Earlier, the senior army general, Than Shwe, who also serves as prime minister, threatened to \"eliminate\" rivals of the regime. General Shwe told an army day parade \"Whoever disturbs the stability and hinders the development of the nation must be eliminated as the common enemy.\" Ms Suu Kyi's new confrontation seems to be a deliberate effort to rally support at a time when hope of an accommodation with the junta has faded completely. She described the restraints on her travel in a recent television interview conducted secretly by the US network NBC. \"They've closed off the road to my house,\" she said. \"There are barricades on either side of my garden. So I can't really go out without them knowing.\" \"And every time I go out, I'm followed by two cars and two motorbikes. They're outside now sitting and waiting for me to come out.\" She has been under house arrest in Rangoon for 11 years.",

Union leaders warned yesterday that the government would have a struggle to get the bill approved when parliament returns from its summer recess. \"We will lobby every deputy in parliament and mobilise all our forces against [the measure],\" said Resul Akay, of the conservative union Kamu-Sen, which has several hundred thousand members. Other unions and human rights groups have also expressed their opposition. It could become quite a fight. The national security council, which is dominated by military leaders, said earlier this week that there was an urgent need to pass legislation as soon as possible. The plan to get rid of what the establishment calls \"enemies of the state\" has already provoked a constitutional crisis. The government tried to change the law by cabinet decree but President Ahmet Necdet Sezer twice refused to sign it. The president, who took office in May, emphasised that his veto was not aimed at the proposal itself, but he has insisted that it must be introduced by parliamentary legislation rather than cabinet decree. The government has responded angrily by publicly accusing Mr Sezer of exceeding his powers and hindering the fight against radical Islam. Pressure from the military establishment seems to be the decisive factor behind the rising political temperature. The generals are reported to have criticised the president behind the scenes, and they are demanding results. A report presented to the national security council identified 252 local governors among those who are alleged to be sympathetic to the Islamist cause. The move to sack \"suspect\" civil servants is part of a continuing campaign against political Islam which was launched with military backing more than three years ago. In 1997 Turkey's first Islamist-led government was forced to resign by what local commentators called a \"soft coup\". The unions are afraid that the proposed dismissals may turn into a witch-hunt.

      "body": "<p>Seven years after the Russian army pulled out of its base in Klomino, in north-western Poland, the surrounding woods are still sprinkled with landmines and the groundwater is polluted by a 2cm-thick layer of fuel.</p> <p>The derelict village, which lies close to the coast and the German border, is one of hundreds of former military installations in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary which have not yet been put to a new use.</p> <p>The Polish state, which now owns the bases, is hoping for foreign investment and eventual European Union funds, but in the meantime Poles are taking the job of transforming them into their own hands.</p> <p>Margareta Substych, a 23-year-old grocer's assistant, began squatting with her family in a former officer's three-roomed flat in Klomino immediately after the Russians pulled out in 1993.</p> <p>Until recently they had no running water, electricity, or neighbours. But an oil-fired boiler and sewage treatment plant have now been installed to lure investors, along with water-purification and waste-disposal systems. And some months ago another family moved into the estate, which has 700 flats, and together they tend a vegetable garden and feed off an apple orchard.</p> <p>There are other signs of growth. A local law firm has hired a bodyguard to protect two buildings it has just bought, and the Roman Catholic church plans to consecrate the base cinema, which it reportedly acquired for a dollar.</p> <p>Just a few miles north-east, in Borne Sulinowo, is an example of what Klomino aspires to.</p> <p>A few years ago the town existed only on Russian military maps. When the Russians left in a negotiated withdrawal four years after the collapse of communism, their troops took every light-bulb, window-pane, tap, drain-hole cover and sewage pump. Some rooms were even stripped of their wallpaper.</p> <p>Yet today the town demonstrates the hidden potential of the old bases.</p> <p>\"It was such a shock to see it,\" said Maria Czerwiska, head of the local government commission. \"There was no water purification and electricity cables ran willy-nilly underground unprotected by plastic tubing.\"</p> <p>When some of the cables exploded, it was discovered that the withdrawing army had taken the transmission plans with them.</p> <p>But Ms Czerwiska insisted that the Russians left behind a rare opportunity and a chance for the Poles to put their innovative skills to the test.</p> <p>The scale of the challenge is huge. Poland has around 70 former bases and has so far been able to pump in just 164m zloty (\u00a325m). Most of the sprawling derelict sites contain huge blocks of flats, hospitals, aircraft hangars and weed-infested runways.</p> <p>On some of them the huge buildings have been turned into old people's homes and refugee centres.</p> <p>In Kluzewo, Dutch farmers grow potatoes along the abandoned runway and store the crop in bunkers that once housed Soviet fighters. There are plans to turn Bagicz on the Baltic coast into a tourist resort. The singer Michael Jackson has even expressed interest in building a \u00a3330m theme park on an abandoned airfield near Warsaw.</p> <p>Back in Borne Sulinowo, the mayor, Jacek Chrzanowski, is optimistic about the town's future now that the landmines and fuel spills have been cleared.</p> <p>\"We started off with no inhabitants. Now we have 3,600 and the population is growing at around 500 per year,\" he said. Sixty per cent are under 35, and 50% have a secondary or higher education, 10 times the average figure for rural areas.</p> <p>What's more, Borne Sulinowo's land and young population is just 166 miles from Berlin and not far from a planned motorway between Scandinavia and central Europe.</p> <p>A priest was the first to arrive, setting up St Albert's church in the base's former cinema. From the mid-90s a gradual stream of adventurous types started to come from all over Poland as news spread of cheap flats in the former barracks in beautiful countryside.</p> <p>\"There s now a complete social mix from all over the country, a phenomena which has never occurred in Poland before,\" Mr Chrzanowski said, proud of the region's pine forests, and its rich fishing and hunting opportunities.</p> <p>The community now includes artists from Warsaw, doctors from the south, redundant miners and former prisoners. Three-hundred businesses have taken advantage of a three-year tax-break, cheap property, and low-cost labour. They include a German paint factory and a 400-employee Polish wood-processing business which exports 98% of its garden furniture products.</p> <p>Plans are afoot to relocate 80 laid-off miners and their families from the industrial heartland of Silesia. Here their thin pensions will go much further and the microclimate will help those with breathing difficulties. Doctors boast that the air has something special to it, since the town's birthrate is roughly six times the Polish average.</p> <p>\"I know two 'infertile' families from Silesia who came here and got pregnant almost immediately,\" said Dariusz Tedenko a community policeman and historian.</p> <p>But despite strenuous local efforts it will probably take until Poland s accession to the European Union - which it aspires to join within the next three years - for it to acquire the amount of development capital needed to realise the bases' potential.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Seven years after the Russian army pulled out of its base in Klomino, in north-western Poland, the surrounding woods are still sprinkled with landmines and the groundwater is polluted by a 2cm-thick layer of fuel. The derelict village, which lies close to the coast and the German border, is one of hundreds of former military installations in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary which have not yet been put to a new use. The Polish state, which now owns the bases, is hoping for foreign investment and eventual European Union funds, but in the meantime Poles are taking the job of transforming them into their own hands. Margareta Substych, a 23-year-old grocer's assistant, began squatting with her family in a former officer's three-roomed flat in Klomino immediately after the Russians pulled out in 1993. Until recently they had no running water, electricity, or neighbours. But an oil-fired boiler and sewage treatment plant have now been installed to lure investors, along with water-purification and waste-disposal systems. And some months ago another family moved into the estate, which has 700 flats, and together they tend a vegetable garden and feed off an apple orchard. There are other signs of growth. A local law firm has hired a bodyguard to protect two buildings it has just bought, and the Roman Catholic church plans to consecrate the base cinema, which it reportedly acquired for a dollar. Just a few miles north-east, in Borne Sulinowo, is an example of what Klomino aspires to. A few years ago the town existed only on Russian military maps. When the Russians left in a negotiated withdrawal four years after the collapse of communism, their troops took every light-bulb, window-pane, tap, drain-hole cover and sewage pump. Some rooms were even stripped of their wallpaper. Yet today the town demonstrates the hidden potential of the old bases. \"It was such a shock to see it,\" said Maria Czerwiska, head of the local government commission. \"There was no water purification and electricity cables ran willy-nilly underground unprotected by plastic tubing.\" When some of the cables exploded, it was discovered that the withdrawing army had taken the transmission plans with them. But Ms Czerwiska insisted that the Russians left behind a rare opportunity and a chance for the Poles to put their innovative skills to the test. The scale of the challenge is huge. Poland has around 70 former bases and has so far been able to pump in just 164m zloty (\u00a325m). Most of the sprawling derelict sites contain huge blocks of flats, hospitals, aircraft hangars and weed-infested runways. On some of them the huge buildings have been turned into old people's homes and refugee centres. In Kluzewo, Dutch farmers grow potatoes along the abandoned runway and store the crop in bunkers that once housed Soviet fighters. There are plans to turn Bagicz on the Baltic coast into a tourist resort. The singer Michael Jackson has even expressed interest in building a \u00a3330m theme park on an abandoned airfield near Warsaw. Back in Borne Sulinowo, the mayor, Jacek Chrzanowski, is optimistic about the town's future now that the landmines and fuel spills have been cleared. \"We started off with no inhabitants. Now we have 3,600 and the population is growing at around 500 per year,\" he said. Sixty per cent are under 35, and 50% have a secondary or higher education, 10 times the average figure for rural areas. What's more, Borne Sulinowo's land and young population is just 166 miles from Berlin and not far from a planned motorway between Scandinavia and central Europe. A priest was the first to arrive, setting up St Albert's church in the base's former cinema. From the mid-90s a gradual stream of adventurous types started to come from all over Poland as news spread of cheap flats in the former barracks in beautiful countryside. \"There s now a complete social mix from all over the country, a phenomena which has never occurred in Poland before,\" Mr Chrzanowski said, proud of the region's pine forests, and its rich fishing and hunting opportunities. The community now includes artists from Warsaw, doctors from the south, redundant miners and former prisoners. Three-hundred businesses have taken advantage of a three-year tax-break, cheap property, and low-cost labour. They include a German paint factory and a 400-employee Polish wood-processing business which exports 98% of its garden furniture products. Plans are afoot to relocate 80 laid-off miners and their families from the industrial heartland of Silesia. Here their thin pensions will go much further and the microclimate will help those with breathing difficulties. Doctors boast that the air has something special to it, since the town's birthrate is roughly six times the Polish average. \"I know two 'infertile' families from Silesia who came here and got pregnant almost immediately,\" said Dariusz Tedenko a community policeman and historian. But despite strenuous local efforts it will probably take until Poland s accession to the European Union - which it aspires to join within the next three years - for it to acquire the amount of development capital needed to realise the bases' potential.",

Since Kirsty's death the Morrises have been in contact with her parents to offer support. The local Liberal Democrat MP, Richard Livsey, and assembly member Kirsty Williams were present. After the service, a family friend, Mike Gooding, read out a statement on behalf of Kirsty's parents. It said: \"The circumstances of her death make coming to terms with her loss all the more difficult and we hope and pray for a swift conclusion to the investigation in Thailand. \"Kirsty was a wonderful daughter and we miss her terribly. But she loved to travel and she made friends all over the world. Her zest for life and her love will always live with us.\" Press Association",

The unauthorised removal of baby organs at Yorkhill, Glasgow's main children's hospital for sick children, came to light following a public inquiry into Bristol royal infirmary this year, which revealed organ retention was common practice up and down the country. Yorkhill admitted in December that it might have failed to explain fully that individual organs might be removed during postmortem examinations. The trust that runs Yorkhill said its practices had been modified in recent years, but had always been in line with other hospitals in the UK. It is not clear how many Scottish families have been affected. Yorkhill says it has handled inquiries from concerned families, but declined to give an exact figure for the number of children involved. Some of the Yorkhill parents say they received letters from the hospital telling them their babies' organs had been taken without their consent. None had been told why the organs were taken. Roseanne Cadden's son, John Paul, died 14 years ago when he was nine months old. Every one of his organs had been removed without her consent.

The exclusion of the Nobel peace prize-winner, who has a huge following around the world, will allow the attendance of a religious delegation from China.

But Mr Cook described this as a mistake. \"The international criminal court will act only where national courts have failed to offer a remedy. Therefore, I think the concern about US servicemen is misplaced. \"There is a strong judicial system in the US, it can take action itself if there were to be breaches of international humanitarian law by US servicemen... in those circumstances the ICC does not apply. \"We in Britain would not be exposing our servicemen to vexatious prosecution. We have signed up to the ICC because we are confident there is no risk of that.\" Mr Cook said the court will send a \"very clear signal to dictators around the world that they cannot get away with mass murder, genocide, or crimes against humanity, such as employing child soldiers\". Even without the US, there is a powerful coalition. Ninety-eight countries have backed the court. The ICC will have an independent prosecutor who can decide what cases to initiate without seeking permission from the UN security council, where decisions are often deadlocked. Mr Cook said: \"It will be a court which will have powers, not just of severe punishment of up to 30 years in prison, but it will also be able to order them to pay reparation to the victims, because people who are brutal dictators often become wealthy dictators, and this court can deal not just with their crimes, but with that wealth.\" In reality, the court is more likely to be effective against small-scale dictators, such as Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, provided he could be arrested. The shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, while welcoming the court in principle, questioned its effectiveness if the US and China declined to sign up. Kate Allen, Amnesty International director, said: \"The draft bill represents a major step forward in the search for global justice. The UK government should be congratulated on its commitment to such a court.\" Useful link www.fco.gov.uk/news/newstext.asp?4085 Draft bill and consultation document on the international criminal court",

      "bodyText": "Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, stunned the US this week by using a visit to Washington to press his call for an open US-Mexico border and a North American economic union similar to the EU. President Bill Clinton and the men who want to succeed him have pleaded with Mr Fox to cool his demands. The US may be the world's main advocate of lowered barriers, but Mr Fox's proposal on August 17 for a North American common market in capital, goods and labour has set political alarm bells ringing in the runup to the presidential election. US and Canadian leaders have told Mr Fox during his visit to the two countries this week that the idea of an open border with a country synonymous for many Americans with drug smuggling and cheap labour is too radical for domestic political consumption. Yesterday Mr Fox travelled to Dallas to meet George W Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, who is also the governor of Texas, the US state with the longest border with Mexico. Mr Bush was expected to make it clear that he would not be interested in Mr Fox's open-border plan. \"I don't think he's fully explained open borders,\" Mr Bush said before the meeting. \"I believe we ought to enforce our borders.\" The US should have a \"special relationship with Mexico as clear and strong as we have had with Canada and Great Britain\", he said yesterday. On Thursday the Democratic presidential candidate, Al Gore, had a similar message for Mr Fox. \"Gore said some elements of Fox's proposal were problematic for the US,\" his national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, said after the men met in Washington. \"But he was interested to note that Fox wanted to paint this as a very long-term vision,\" he added Mr Clinton was less dismissive. \"Obviously we have borders and we have laws that apply to them, and we have to apply them, and so do the Mexicans,\" he said after meeting Mr Fox, who is due to be sworn in on December 1. \"But I think that over the long run our countries will become more interdependent.\" The US and Canada welcomed the former Coca-Cola executive's election in July as a potential breakthrough in relations with Mexico. But Mr Fox caused alarm when he said that he hoped this month's visit would lay the foundations for an opening of borders between the three countries, which are signatories to the 1994 North American free trade agreement (Nafta). In an interview with American journalists, Mr Fox cited the EU as a model of states in a region building a working common market with a free movement of capital and labour. \"It doesn't necessarily have to be the same as the European Union,\" he said. \"But they can serve as an inspiration for us.\" Mr Fox said that the three Nafta countries should set common economic goals for the next 10 years for inflation, interest rates and budget deficits. He said the border could be opened gradually, beginning with free transit in a limited zone, or with more temporary visas for Mexican workers, who currently remit about $6bn (\u00a34bn) a year to relatives. In Ottawa on Wednesday the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, poured cold water on Mr Fox's ideas, setting a tone which was maintained in the US. \"I don't think we can adopt the European model in the years to come,\" he said. \"Nafta is working very well for now.\" The chief fear is that Mr Fox's plans would bring a huge increase in Mexican migration to the US, helping to drive down US wages and the price of American exports. Mr Fox says that his aim is to create economic conditions which will help to stem the flow of legal and illegal migration across the border. \"The best thing that could happen to the United States is to have a successful Mexico, a Mexico without poverty, a Mexico without violence, a Mexico without drug smuggling, a Mexico with employment opportunities for all, where people don't have to migrate to the United States,\" he said on August 17. \u0095In a speech yesterday on relations with Latin America, Mr Bush said that, if elected, he would seek authority to negotiate free trade agreements with all the countries of the region.

Both were victims of what the International Prisons Observatory called \"brutal harassment\" in the jail, France's largest, which holds 400 long-term and 400 short-term prisoners.</p> <p>Prison warders blamed a shortage of manpower, a crippling lack of resources and an atmosphere of \"appalling insecurity\" due largely to the growing number of psychologically disturbed inmates.</p> <p>\"The situation is the same all over France,\" said Philippe Dor\u00e9 of the prison officers' union. \"We try to do a good job but it's impossible. There are too few of us, we're demotivated and we're being sent more and more psychotics. There is a terrible malaise in French prisons.\"</p> <p>The suicides have fuelled the row over prison conditions triggered by the chief doctor at Paris's La Sant\u00e9 jail, Veronique Vasseur, who denounced the inhuman squalor of the capital's most famous prison in a best-selling book this spring.</p> <p>She said that cockroaches, rats and other vermin were commonplace, hygiene was non-existent and rapes, fist-fights and self-mutilation were almost daily occurrences.</p> <p>\"Some improvements have been made,\" Ms Vasseur wrote. \"But the majority of problems remain: drugs, the omnipresence of sex, the absence of supervision at night, the filth, the lack of hygiene, the decay. The place remains an inhuman nightmare, an eternal shame to France.\"</p> <p>Partly in response to the furore surrounding Ms Vasseur's book and to surveys showing that nearly 50% of the French believe their country's prison system is rotten, MPs and senators produced two reports on the nation's jails in July, just before their summer recess.</p> <p>The cross-party reports, based on prison visits and interviews with former inmates, warders, relatives, magistrates and prison directors, concluded that drastic reforms were needed, particularly as France's prison population has doubled over the past 40 years.</p> <p>\"We need to rethink the entire basis of our prison system,\" Jacques Floch, a Socialist MP and co-author of one report, said. \"We have no single body of legislation directly governing prison conditions and no consistent penal policy, just reactive, day-by-day chaos.\"</p> <p>The deputies were critical of plans by the justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, to build half a dozen big new jails, arguing that alternative punishment or treatment would be far more appropriate than prison for many inmates.</p> <p>They demanded instead a multi-million pound refurbishment programme and the construction of small new detention centres where conditions could be more effectively maintained and inmates prepared for their return to society.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two suicides in the space of a week at a jail near Rouen have rekindled debate about French prison conditions, just weeks after a damning parliamentary report said the country's jails were \"the humiliation of the Republic\". The unnamed men, both serving long sentences for child sex offences, hanged themselves in their cells at the Val de Reuil penitentiary last week. Both were victims of what the International Prisons Observatory called \"brutal harassment\" in the jail, France's largest, which holds 400 long-term and 400 short-term prisoners. Prison warders blamed a shortage of manpower, a crippling lack of resources and an atmosphere of \"appalling insecurity\" due largely to the growing number of psychologically disturbed inmates. \"The situation is the same all over France,\" said Philippe Dor\u00e9 of the prison officers' union. \"We try to do a good job but it's impossible. There are too few of us, we're demotivated and we're being sent more and more psychotics. There is a terrible malaise in French prisons.\" The suicides have fuelled the row over prison conditions triggered by the chief doctor at Paris's La Sant\u00e9 jail, Veronique Vasseur, who denounced the inhuman squalor of the capital's most famous prison in a best-selling book this spring. She said that cockroaches, rats and other vermin were commonplace, hygiene was non-existent and rapes, fist-fights and self-mutilation were almost daily occurrences. \"Some improvements have been made,\" Ms Vasseur wrote. \"But the majority of problems remain: drugs, the omnipresence of sex, the absence of supervision at night, the filth, the lack of hygiene, the decay. The place remains an inhuman nightmare, an eternal shame to France.\" Partly in response to the furore surrounding Ms Vasseur's book and to surveys showing that nearly 50% of the French believe their country's prison system is rotten, MPs and senators produced two reports on the nation's jails in July, just before their summer recess. The cross-party reports, based on prison visits and interviews with former inmates, warders, relatives, magistrates and prison directors, concluded that drastic reforms were needed, particularly as France's prison population has doubled over the past 40 years. \"We need to rethink the entire basis of our prison system,\" Jacques Floch, a Socialist MP and co-author of one report, said. \"We have no single body of legislation directly governing prison conditions and no consistent penal policy, just reactive, day-by-day chaos.\" The deputies were critical of plans by the justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, to build half a dozen big new jails, arguing that alternative punishment or treatment would be far more appropriate than prison for many inmates. They demanded instead a multi-million pound refurbishment programme and the construction of small new detention centres where conditions could be more effectively maintained and inmates prepared for their return to society.",

Since 1994, the New York Times has turned routine society bulletins into a fascinating human-interest feature. The process was gradual. First, studio portraits of the bride in her finery diminished, replaced by informal shots of the bride and groom together. Although the Times still insisted that the couple be conservatively attired and posed, these snapshots revealed much that had been invisible before about marital choices - age differences, sense of style, racial intermarriage, and, paradoxically, the tendency for people to chose those who resemble them. Many couples could be brother and sister. </p> <p>Second, the wedding announcements got more detailed. The Times began printing the ages of the bride and groom, and nowadays in an entire week, most are over 30. The announcements also reflect the impact of feminism; many brides plan to keep their maiden names, and have jobs as impressive as those of their partners. Indeed, as David Brooks says in Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There, the Times weddings are the new \"mergers and acquisitions\" page. The Times, he charges, \"emphasizes four things about a person - college degrees, graduate degrees, career path, and parents' profession - for these are the markers of upscale Americans today\". </p> <p>But the dreams of upscale Americans are surprisingly diverse, as we learned when the Times began to treat one wedding a week in depth in a column called \"Vows\". </p> <p>Lois Smith Brady, the writer, attended weddings and interviewed friends and relatives to compile a profile of the happy couple. When she began the column, Brady explains in her book Love Lessons (2000), her \"main goal was to describe in the least frilly way possible, very frilly and overdone things - gigantic wedding dresses, million-dollar flower displays, cakes decorated with sugar swans\". But she soon discovered that she was actually writing about love stories. \"I have come to view Vows as a small-town kind of column... stories with happy endings... proof that love, optimism, guts, grace, perfect partners and very good luck do exist.\" Her stories depict a Manhattan as moodily romantic as the setting of a Woody Allen movie, and as rosily democratic as a Fourth of July barbecue. </p> <p>This past week, for example, the Vows column described the wedding of Althea Beaton and Malik Shabazz Ducard, who both received scholarships to boarding schools from A Better Chance, an organisation that \"places and guides minority children in private schools\", and met as students in African politics at Columbia University. The bride, who now works for Mattel, has \"eyelashes as long as a giraffe's, a waist as thin as Barbie's, a deep laugh and a hard-working, ambitious temperament.\" The bride explained that her husband, an executive at MGM, fits well into her family: \"The men in my family had humble beginnings. They worked hard, studied hard, and reached a level of success, and Malik is cut from that same cloth.\" </p> <p> Most recently, the Times has expanded wedding announcements to include the personal details that have enchanted readers of Vows. On August 20, we read how Joshua Steckel wooed Beth Zasloff by giving her his old couch and helping her move it into her new apartment. \"I had fantasies about our grandchildren sleeping on that couch,\" Ms Zasloff recalled. Samantha Atkins and Kenneth Ahdoot, on the next page, met in an anatomy class in their first year of medical school. \"I thought he was cute, and so I would go over to check out his cadaver and ask questions,\" Dr Atkins said.

The emphasis here is either sociological, emphasising rising costs and ostentatious display, or autobiographical, with columnists telling their own stories, including many unhappy endings. Perhaps the American press sees marriage as a metaphor for the American dream, always optimistic and infinitely renewable, and the British press is dominated by tough-minded realists, who believe that vows of true love are best assessed in retrospect, at the end of a marriage or at the end of a life.

Now a meringue - that's probably the Marquis of Vauvenargues: next a drop scone - that's Cowdenbeath: and then a jam butty, perhaps, to remind me of distant happy times in the north. Sometimes the scampering ceases, and I'm left in lonely communion with a large china teapot.

I also questioned whether this Gustav Le Bon, expert on ochlocracy*, and Gustave le Bon, coiner of pithy apophthegms, were one person or two. I expected a mountainous postbag, falling into two parts: (1) letters saying - you nincompoop, of course they were the same person; being French he spelled his name Gustave, not Gustav, etc etc; and (2) letters saying: you ninny: you've confused the ochlocracy** expert Gustav with the famous Dutch magician, oboist, amateur hockey international and ace aphorism-coiner Gustave. </p> <p>Neither set of tirades has erupted, leaving me to fall back on the Concise Universal Biography (published 1935) which says that le Bon was an even riper figure than I'd supposed: the first Frenchman ever to explore Nepal, and an expert on radioactivity. In 1896, he published a paper proving that a phosphorescent body, if exposed to sunlight, preserved for 18 months the power of emitting invisible radiation, which he termed black light, and which electrified the surrounding atmosphere. Quite your little renaissance man, despite his deplorable views. A very erudite person tells me he also said: \"The substitution of the unconscious action of crowds for the conscious activity of individuals is one of the principal characteristics of the present age.\" The present age when he wrote was a century back, but his rule applies just as much, she suggests, to our own: see the crowds which gather in offices to witness the latest events in Big Brother. </p> <p>\u0095 The composer Chausson, I saw it suggested this week, is more famous for the manner of his death than for his music. This is not necessarily so. I know a little of Chausson's music but knew nothing of his death until I read this assertion. He died in the penultimate year of the 19th century (1899) in a bicycle accident. He was only 44. Perhaps some statistician could tell me, or some actuary taking a break from the gay giddy round which is that profession's fate, whether artists are more likely than most to lose their lives because of encounters with traffic. I think of Ravel, who, already ailing, never really recovered after a taxi in which he was travelling met with an accident. Also of Gaud\u00ed, who died when hit by a tram, which is why his great cathedral in Barcelona never got finished. Though it didn't kill him, Charles Dickens sustained injuries in a railway accident from which he never fully recovered. I dare say someone will shortly produce an Oxford Book of the Deaths of Great Artists, complete with last words where established, which will take this matter further. </p> <p>\u0095 In an article in the Guardian about the national lottery, Matthew Taylor of the Institute for Public Policy Research spoke of the \"improbably named\" chair of the Lottery Commission - Dame Helena Shovelton. What is so very improbable? Would it sound less improbable if you deducted the dame and left her plain Helena Shovelton? I guess so. The dame was born Helena Richards, a name which would not produce even the slighest lift in Taylor's eyebrows. Do public policy experts think that when a civil servant called Shovelton asked her to marry him, she should have retorted: \"I cannot! I must not be made to sound improbable! I might be a dame one day! I could never be known as Dame Helena Shovelton! Unhand me this instant!\" The notion is quite absurd. What is odd is when people refer to her as Dame Shovelton, as if she were some equivalent of Dame Partington, who tried to repel the sea with a broom. </p> <p>\u0095 I am sorry to see the American conductor Leonard Slatkin is in trouble for criticising the way some musicians dress.

He ought not to be deterred. I contend that his outburst on unsuitable modes of dress may owe less to the orchestras he has conducted than to what he has read about music-making in Britain a few decades back.

I see my mind as a sort of Corner House caf\u00e9, in which waitresses in starched aprons - nippies, I think they were called in the old days - scurry to and fro delivering treats on plates. Now a meringue - that's probably the Marquis of Vauvenargues: next a drop scone - that's Cowdenbeath: and then a jam butty, perhaps, to remind me of distant happy times in the north. Sometimes the scampering ceases, and I'm left in lonely communion with a large china teapot.

For the third time in little more than a year, members of the upper house have had to find a new leader after the most recent senate president, Chuba Okadigbo, was exposed as having illegally awarding himself \u00a3390,000 in allowances and a Christmas bonus.

      "body": "<p>One of the strangest sights in London can be found in Somerset House. In a room attached to the Gilbert collection is a reproduction of Sir Arthur Gilbert's study in Beverly Hills, with a life-size waxwork of Gilbert, wearing tennis clothes and holding a large white telephone. I don't know if in real life the great collector has his own hair, but in this corner of his lovely home, he appears to be wearing a toupee: the effect is ghoulish. On a wall facing the dynamic but inanimate tycoon are two portraits of Sir Arthur and Lady Gilbert. These appear to have been painted by the people who produce pictures of ancestors for low-budget TV films. They may be two of the worst portraits I have ever seen. I found myself staring at this room with more attention than I devoted to the bejewelled snuffboxes and ornate silver that Gilbert collected. </p> <p>I tried to imagine the circumstances in which a very rich, elderly, man would have demanded his own mini Madame Tussaud's as a condition of making over some of his treasures to Somerset House. I tried to imagine that most suave of men, Lord Rothschild, announcing to his fellow trustees that the idea was to have a waxwork of Sir Arthur Gilbert in tennis clothes, holding a phone, as part of the display. Perhaps he suggested it might be a kind of Jeff Koons work of art in itself - a little light relief from the unrelenting opulence of the collection. Malcolm Muggeridge described failure in politics as casting a retrospective gloom - like adultery, I think he added - and I found myself feeling retrospectively gloomy about the Gilbert collection. </p> <p>Could it be that the whole collection was in some way a demonstration of the magpie tendency - glitter as a top priority? And then I fell to wondering about the motives of many of the great collectors, and my conclusions were sombre. In one gallery is a display of a new artform (new to me) called \"micromosaics\" by Gilbert. These are reproductions of paintings and in some cases original works, done in tiny glass mosaics. From a distance they look more or less as though they have been painted. Close to, you see that they are in fact a fantastically pointless exercise in painting by numbers, done with tiny pieces of mosaic, as many as 1,400 pieces of coloured glass per square inch. They look like deranged souvenirs. But I did decide that if I ever acquired another elephant, I would save up for a silver howdah. Gilbert has two, flogged off by impoverished maharajahs. </p> <p> \u0095 A new book, A Mouthful of Glass, by a Dutch writer, explores the life of Demetrios Tsafendas, the man who in 1966 murdered the architect of apartheid, Hendrik Verwoerd. Demetrios was a temporary messenger in the parliament. He stabbed Verwoerd in the neck. </p> <p>I spoke to the author, Henk van Woerden, whose parents emigrated to South Africa.

      "bodyText": "One of the strangest sights in London can be found in Somerset House. In a room attached to the Gilbert collection is a reproduction of Sir Arthur Gilbert's study in Beverly Hills, with a life-size waxwork of Gilbert, wearing tennis clothes and holding a large white telephone. I don't know if in real life the great collector has his own hair, but in this corner of his lovely home, he appears to be wearing a toupee: the effect is ghoulish. On a wall facing the dynamic but inanimate tycoon are two portraits of Sir Arthur and Lady Gilbert. These appear to have been painted by the people who produce pictures of ancestors for low-budget TV films. They may be two of the worst portraits I have ever seen. I found myself staring at this room with more attention than I devoted to the bejewelled snuffboxes and ornate silver that Gilbert collected. I tried to imagine the circumstances in which a very rich, elderly, man would have demanded his own mini Madame Tussaud's as a condition of making over some of his treasures to Somerset House. I tried to imagine that most suave of men, Lord Rothschild, announcing to his fellow trustees that the idea was to have a waxwork of Sir Arthur Gilbert in tennis clothes, holding a phone, as part of the display. Perhaps he suggested it might be a kind of Jeff Koons work of art in itself - a little light relief from the unrelenting opulence of the collection. Malcolm Muggeridge described failure in politics as casting a retrospective gloom - like adultery, I think he added - and I found myself feeling retrospectively gloomy about the Gilbert collection. Could it be that the whole collection was in some way a demonstration of the magpie tendency - glitter as a top priority? And then I fell to wondering about the motives of many of the great collectors, and my conclusions were sombre. In one gallery is a display of a new artform (new to me) called \"micromosaics\" by Gilbert. These are reproductions of paintings and in some cases original works, done in tiny glass mosaics. From a distance they look more or less as though they have been painted. Close to, you see that they are in fact a fantastically pointless exercise in painting by numbers, done with tiny pieces of mosaic, as many as 1,400 pieces of coloured glass per square inch. They look like deranged souvenirs. But I did decide that if I ever acquired another elephant, I would save up for a silver howdah. Gilbert has two, flogged off by impoverished maharajahs. \u0095 A new book, A Mouthful of Glass, by a Dutch writer, explores the life of Demetrios Tsafendas, the man who in 1966 murdered the architect of apartheid, Hendrik Verwoerd. Demetrios was a temporary messenger in the parliament. He stabbed Verwoerd in the neck. I spoke to the author, Henk van Woerden, whose parents emigrated to South Africa. He told me he had long been fascinated by the story, not least because Verwoerd was also the son of Dutch immigrants. Tsafendas died last year in the asylum where he was forgotten for many years. Van Woerden met him and said he had considerable charm. As a boy, I used to go to the Rand Easter Show in Johannesburg, mainly to meet horsey girls. There, not 20 yards from where I was sitting in 1960, a farmer called David Pratt shot Verwoerd twice in the head with a .22 pistol from very close range.

Phoebe's kookiness was set against Rachel's self-consciousness, Monica's anally-retentive nature was challenged by Chandler's rearrangement of their apartment, Joey's hopeless womanising was to the fore with his new roommate (in the form of Elle Macpherson) and Ross was plain old pathetic. </p> <p>It has been said that sitcoms don't work any more because they don't use stereotypes, but the likes of Friends and Frasier show that to be untrue.

It can only be a matter of time until local historian and bow tie-wearer Anthony removes his gaze from Rita's roots (her family tree's, that is, since looking at Rita's hair for too long can induce blindness) and exposes Debs/Patricia's double life as high-flying lawyer and denim jacket-clad hairdresser.

It has three. </p> <p>My first lovely honey came in the form of Edwina Currie on Late Night Currie (Radio 5 Live) on Sunday. This is such a perky little number, it makes Late Junction's penchant for Mongolian nose flute symphonies from the 12th century look positively pedestrian. This is mainly due to Currie's dominatrix approach to presenting. Tony Bullimore was on to talk about sailing round the world with Lenny Henry, as you do. </p> <p>Maybe it's since his mid-Atlantic near-death experience, but boy can he ramble on. He also has one of those talking tics that, once you notice it, drowns out everything else he says. My mum has a friend who does this, starting every sentence with \"I/She/He/They turned around and said_\". You can't listen without visualising every member of her personal cast as perpetual spinning tops. Bullimore's is \"you know\", said like a muted Frankie Howerd, linking together some of the longest stories known to man. La Currie was going crackers, snipping, snapping, finishing his sentences and verbally bundling him out of the studio. </p> <p>She interviewed a woman who has spent 40 years with chimps too. This was just as much fun, with the woman telling us about Froddo, \"The biggest, strongest chimp we've even known\". He knocks you over, drags you a bit and sometimes stamps on you. So that is where Edwina learned her interview technique. I had the most lurid dreams after this frothy mix, I can tell you. </p> <p>Monday, wimped out back to Late Junction in shock. Emboldened by some frog music (yes, really) I spent Tuesday bedtime in the company of shock jock James Whale on Talk Sport. It all made perfect sense in the world that is Talk. Whale was calling for camps in which to deposit scumbags (asylum seekers) and grotbags (beggars) and was encouraging us to \"smile\" about the fate of the Kursk, as it's sinking meant one sub and lots of Russian sailors less to worry about as enemies. The Cold War hasn't defrosted on Talk. </p> <p>\"Russia's more dangerous now than ever,\" he told one caller, a woman who like me had just found Whale by accident. Her husband was away, she said, as if that's the only reason she could go wild and touch that dial. I counted my blessings and dreamed of a camp for all the Talk Sport presenters and callers. One caller stopped what he was saying to inform the nation that a topless lady was peering out of a window in Kensington. Another had written to Teletext about the Kursk. Teletext. </p> <p>Wednesday brought the bizarre feast that is the Janice Long show (Radio 2). The mix is some music (Los Lobos, Sheryl Crow, kd lang), some competitions, and some gentle polemic from our Janice. Nasty Nick fever is out of control she said. \"There are people in this country who have committed far worse crimes, I'm sure,\" she said, all sage-like. </p> <p>A man called Thomas called in with the wrong answer for a quiz. Why do that? Why put him on just to humiliate him? Especially when he was clearly an ex-colleague of David Shayler's. \"I can't say where I am,\" said Tommy, calling from his workplace. Asked if he wanted to say hello to anyone, he almost whispered: \"That might reveal where I am.\" </p> <p>Where I am now, is back in my late-night listening rut.

Set all this in a bathroom and you have something very wonderful: Federico Leon's 1500 Metres Above the Level of Jack (Mil quinientos metros sobre el nivel de Jack), a show that puts the quirk back into quirky and then some. </p> <p>The international festival director, Brian McMaster, stumbled upon a rehearsal for this production in Buenos Aires last year and snapped it up for Edinburgh on the spot. \"We have nothing like it in the programme,\" is his reasoned explanation (and given the uneven theatre offerings this year, that's a compliment). Jack is dreamy, seductive, irresistible, like underwater swimming in proper, clear sea. </p> <p>Jack, a husband, father and compulsive diver, has gone missing, maybe with another woman. His wife sits in a bath, the tap dripping all the while (\"great unease for those of us with weak bladders\" said a gent in the front row), her son dips in and out. He is wearing a wetsuit, she a cozzie. They watch telly, though the picture is not great. \"It's got water in it,\" she says. </p> <p>They splish and splosh and then are joined by the son's girlfriend, Lisa (she's really called Marina), and her oddball son, Enzo. He throws water biscuits at people. They both have swimming gear on under their clothes. The man in their life has also disappeared, maybe drowned himself. They all end up in the bath. </p> <p>Somehow, out of this strangeness, Leon weaves a poetic, often demonically funny tale about what it means to be a father, what it means to be abandoned. The ways in which we shield ourselves from the harshness of reality are in the mix too - they each slink under the water, envelop themselves in wetsuits. It is beautifully acted by the small cast. Hold your breath, prepare yourself for strangeness as startling as a pool of icy water: jump in. (EB) \u0095 Till tomorrow. Box office: 0131-473 2000. </p> <p><strong> Comedy <strong> <br> The Johnny Vegas Gameshow ****</strong> Edinburgh Garden Party </strong><br> When Johnny Vegas exhorts you to \"'ave some fun, son,\" what he really means is \"be afraid - be very afraid\". This year, the hectoring, belligerent comic has left behind his potter's wheel and gone for a briskly tacky gameshow format. Woe betide anyone frogmarched into being a contestant: the alternative title could be Who Wants To Be A Nervous Wreck? </p> <p>I would not for all the tea in China (or as it happened, all the Heineken in a supermarket trolley) have been in the shoes of hapless Charlie, who turned out to be the comedy reviewer from the Observer. He got off lightly. Worse yet to be on the receiving end of Johnny's affection, like the male contestant who was wrestled to the floor in an extended display of slobbering lachrymose tenderness. </p> <p>Vegas, a rotund, boozy Pa Ubu in a crimplene safari suit, knows that terror is the unspoken key ingredient in showbiz, and makes it clear from the start, quickly identifying punters as stalkers or lesbian piano teachers. He divides the audience into two and sets the teams against each other, because \"hatred breeds entertainment\". Not so much Chris Tarrant, then, as Chris Tyrant. The terror only increases when Vegas exposes his blubbering, embittered vulnerability - playing secret tapes of so-called friends carping about him, or moaning about his failure to get a part in the forthcoming Lord of The Rings movie. </p> <p>The momentum is touch-and-go, full blast at the start, then sagging badly. By the end, people have even started warming to Vegas, which is a worrying sign. But when he is on form, he has Theatre of Cruelty down to a tee. (JR) <strong> Classical <strong><br> Late Night Bach *****</strong> Usher Hall, Edinburgh </strong><br> Andras Schiff's late-night concerts of Bach's keyboard music have become a feature of recent festivals. This year he turns his attention to the six English suites Bach compiled around 1725, though they were probably written more than a decade before. Schiff has become something of a talisman for the whole music programme at the international festival: he has been at the centre of four concerts of Schumann's chamber music over the past week. </p> <p>One of the products of such a close relationship between festival and artist is that the audience has the concentration of a gathering of Schiff's closest confidants. You sense that his playing is as free from mannerism and as intimate as it would be in his own front room; and the atmosphere bristles with a keen, cerebral focus on the stark mastery of Bach's compositions and Schiff's performances. </p> <p>Yet there is nothing austere about Schiff's attitude to Bach. In fact in movements like the headlong rush of the Bour\u00e9es and Gigue from the first suite, he has an impish impetuosity, and for all the seriousness of the E minor fifth suite, it is his playful exaggeration of the final Gigue's vivid chromaticism which is most memorable. </p> <p>From the rustic drone of the Musette in the third suite to the rigorous counterpoint of the fifth suite's Prelude, Schiff conjures Bach's expressive world to life. For an hour in the Usher Hall, Bach's music is a complete, all-encompassing musical universe. (TS)</p> <p>\u0095 Final concert tonight at 10.30pm. </p> <p> <strong> Cabaret <strong> <br>Arthur Smith sings Leonard Cohen ***</strong> Edinburgh Pleasance </strong><br> Arthur Smith has long been a dangerously over-exposed figure - Loose Ends, BA's soporific in-flight comedy programme, and even a Guardian Edinburgh diary - so it comes as a surprise to be reminded that he is such a commanding performer. With his doleful, grey, rasping voice, emerging as if from the bottom of a deep well, he is a perfect candidate to perform the Leonard Cohen songbook. </p> <p>He sings out of love for the man's work, and because the show's title suggested the most lugubrious afternoon you could imagine on the fringe. </p> <p>It is partly a tribute to Cohen - \"the greatest comedian of the 20th century\" - partly a rambling philosophical discourse on boredom, addiction, depression and ducks. Smith maintains a rather lofty distance from the audience, telling his tales in a stentorian boom. He is very much a monologist rather than a stand-up, and the riffing factor in his routine is nil. But his intricately structured ramble, which, I suspect, would be even better on radio, affectingly mixes farce with a streak of melancholy. </p> <p>It is only a shame that his rather heartfelt renditions of Famous Blue Raincoat and other bedsit favourites are self-consciously sabotaged by his clowning around with the guitarist. Ronnie Golden may do a virtuoso Jimi Hendrix impression, but the device of the comedy accompanist is one of the wearier institutions of the circuit. </p> <p>Still, believe it or not, Smith can sing - that is, inasmuch as Leonard Cohen himself can. To paraphrase the great man, he was born this way, he had no choice, he was born with the gift of a golden voice. A Jacques Brel for the 21st century, surely, or Rod McKuen on acid? (JR)</p> <p><strong> Film <strong><br> George Washington ****</strong> Cameo cinema </strong><br> The title is deceptive. David Gordon Green's feature film debut is not a biography of the pre-eminent revolutionary of the US, but a sardonic, beautifully filmed fable of America's predilection for indulging in heroic ideals. </p> <p>There is something of the resonance that Wes Anderson's Rushmore, summoning up the giant presidential rock carvings, got out of its title; and in its flashes of humour and its idiosyncratic protagonist, George Washington actually echoes much of Rushmore's distinctive mood. But the milieu is considerably different - a small, rusting southern town, its multi-racial population living in fragile harmony - and at George Washington's forefront are a bunch of young teens whiling away their summer at the swimming hole or running along the railway tracks. </p> <p>There is a character called George, but he is no Washington: he is a 13-year-old African- American kid (Donald Holden) who has to wear a crash helmet because of a skull-plates problem. He is sweet natured, but hardly the brightest penny on the collection plate. The film's narrator is 12-year-old Nasia (Candace Evanofski), whose rambling, meditative voiceovers convey a beyond-her-years sophistication. </p> <p>Scene casually follows scene: kids fight, local track workers eat their lunch, girls discuss their boyfriends. What initially appears a beguiling, but directionless, narrative is suddenly focused when, out of the blue, one of the teens is accidentally killed, and events take a macabre, stricken turn and the movie just gets weirder, and funnier. </p> <p>Writer-director Green deserves considerable credit for creating an authentically impressive film at his first attempt. The effortless naturalism of his performers only reinforces the film's matter-of-fact stylishness. (AP) </p> <p>\u0095 Today at Cameo 1. Box 0ffice: 0131-623 8030. </p>",

For an hour in the Usher Hall, Bach's music is a complete, all-encompassing musical universe. (TS) \u0095 Final concert tonight at 10.30pm. Cabaret Arthur Smith sings Leonard Cohen *** Edinburgh Pleasance Arthur Smith has long been a dangerously over-exposed figure - Loose Ends, BA's soporific in-flight comedy programme, and even a Guardian Edinburgh diary - so it comes as a surprise to be reminded that he is such a commanding performer. With his doleful, grey, rasping voice, emerging as if from the bottom of a deep well, he is a perfect candidate to perform the Leonard Cohen songbook. He sings out of love for the man's work, and because the show's title suggested the most lugubrious afternoon you could imagine on the fringe. It is partly a tribute to Cohen - \"the greatest comedian of the 20th century\" - partly a rambling philosophical discourse on boredom, addiction, depression and ducks. Smith maintains a rather lofty distance from the audience, telling his tales in a stentorian boom. He is very much a monologist rather than a stand-up, and the riffing factor in his routine is nil. But his intricately structured ramble, which, I suspect, would be even better on radio, affectingly mixes farce with a streak of melancholy. It is only a shame that his rather heartfelt renditions of Famous Blue Raincoat and other bedsit favourites are self-consciously sabotaged by his clowning around with the guitarist. Ronnie Golden may do a virtuoso Jimi Hendrix impression, but the device of the comedy accompanist is one of the wearier institutions of the circuit. Still, believe it or not, Smith can sing - that is, inasmuch as Leonard Cohen himself can. To paraphrase the great man, he was born this way, he had no choice, he was born with the gift of a golden voice. A Jacques Brel for the 21st century, surely, or Rod McKuen on acid? (JR) Film George Washington **** Cameo cinema The title is deceptive. David Gordon Green's feature film debut is not a biography of the pre-eminent revolutionary of the US, but a sardonic, beautifully filmed fable of America's predilection for indulging in heroic ideals. There is something of the resonance that Wes Anderson's Rushmore, summoning up the giant presidential rock carvings, got out of its title; and in its flashes of humour and its idiosyncratic protagonist, George Washington actually echoes much of Rushmore's distinctive mood. But the milieu is considerably different - a small, rusting southern town, its multi-racial population living in fragile harmony - and at George Washington's forefront are a bunch of young teens whiling away their summer at the swimming hole or running along the railway tracks. There is a character called George, but he is no Washington: he is a 13-year-old African- American kid (Donald Holden) who has to wear a crash helmet because of a skull-plates problem. He is sweet natured, but hardly the brightest penny on the collection plate. The film's narrator is 12-year-old Nasia (Candace Evanofski), whose rambling, meditative voiceovers convey a beyond-her-years sophistication. Scene casually follows scene: kids fight, local track workers eat their lunch, girls discuss their boyfriends. What initially appears a beguiling, but directionless, narrative is suddenly focused when, out of the blue, one of the teens is accidentally killed, and events take a macabre, stricken turn and the movie just gets weirder, and funnier. Writer-director Green deserves considerable credit for creating an authentically impressive film at his first attempt. The effortless naturalism of his performers only reinforces the film's matter-of-fact stylishness. (AP) \u0095 Today at Cameo 1. Box 0ffice: 0131-623 8030.",

      "body": "<p>On paper, it sounds perfect: move into a show house in hip east London for a week and step into a new lifestyle. I had this fantasy of becoming a more glamorous, sexy version of myself. Here, I'd have the life, the parties and the glamour that I can't quite manage in the banal real world.</p> <p>The house is on four floors, just off Old Street, all done up with sleek modern furniture. It's called Play Home - that's not \"play\" as in playing house, as I was doing by moving in there, but rather as in Playboy. The place is awash with black and red, all very retro. It was as if I'd stepped into Patrick Bateman's American Psycho flat circa 1986: black cotton sheets and red satin throw, plus, disconcertingly, a pair of translucent lace Agent Provocateur knicks and balcony bra lying casually on the red chaise longue.</p> <p>The place was less of a home than a stage set for a fictional life - thick shag carpet, two Robin Day sofas (one that turned into a bed with the flick of a switch, giving it a very 007 gadgety feel), cocktail shakers, juicer. The study was hung with film posters from Barbarella, Bullitt and The Italian Job; and the paintings spread over each floor had a distinctly pop edge or an 80s feel. Books such as 60s Decorative Arts, Casino Design, Hip Hotels, plus various guides to poker, gambling and Denon stereos (one per floor) were all deployed to give a picture of just whose home this was - to the point of hyperbole, it seemed to me.</p> <p>It took Suzanne Stankus, Play Home's stylist, the better part of two weeks to kit it all out, and by the end she had come up with a fiction for our resident. \"He's a playboy with money and an international traveller,\" she says. \"He's interested in design and won't buy just anything.\"</p> <p>He likes quality, hence the solid oak bedroom set upstairs, though it doesn't quite seem his style. Only with the 1974 cult classic The Glass Inferno open on the bedside table, and the cufflinks, the half-empty tumblers and the red chaise lounge that looks like a leaning arm waiting to wrap around an unsuspecting date at the cinema, has he - or, rather, Stankus - customised it to his taste. \"He likes books with 60s, 70s and 80s themes, and is into design, art, architecture and film,\" she says. \"He's well-rounded and intellectual.\" After my week there, I am not sure that I'm his type.</p> <p>Anyway, I had my mind on other things. I'd have a week in the perfect life, immaculate furniture, great stereos, and all within stumbling distance of Hoxton. But on my first night, when I was to start actually living there, I was scared of being lonely so I invited a friend and my husband to join me - so much for my idea of a swinging bachelorette/ Bond babe pad. That evening, we drank copiously - there was a well-stocked bar, but no tea bags or even a pint of milk - and ordered in Chinese. It all felt like NYC (a very good thing, since Friend and I are both ex-New Yorkers) - the sight of the tall NatWest building lit up in the distance meant we could almost pretend we were back there.</p> <p>Then, early in the morning - at 5.34am, to be precise - I was really convinced that I was back in Manhattan. Trash pick-up. Just like when I lived in the Lower East Side and NY's Sanitation Department did its rounds at a criminally inhuman hour.</p> <p>At a slightly more decent hour, Habitat, creators of Play Home, had scheduled a training video shoot at the house - the idea is that the house should tell the \"story\" of its autumn/winter collection. I wasn't involved - or invited - but the early arrival of camera crew and lighting folks didn't exactly encourage me to spread out as if I really owned the place. So, while the night before Friend, Husband and I had flopped on every sofa in the place (that is some seven couches) and lounged on the basement's black and red (natch) sheepskin rugs, I made sure to tidy up before I went to work. Also, that night I was having a dinner party - a catered dinner party (I cannot get it up to host such affairs in my real life).</p> <p>People started arriving at 8pm; I'd greet them at the door with a \"Welcome to my house\", and after a glass of wine I actually believed it. Each floor served as a stage set for the evening. We started off in the ground-floor lounge, then graduated to the first-floor dining room and finally settled into the sex den. Well, there is no other way to describe the space, what with its red carpets, black walls, serpentine sectional sofa, card table and acres of sheepskin casually tossed about.</p> <p>Now, there is obviously something a bit odd about moving into a show house and living on parade, though Play Home is more private than some: it's intended mainly for the trade and press. Taking over a real house creates a sense of voyeurism, explains Stankus, \"like you're taking a sneaky look around someone's home\". The difference this time is that the house will remain on show for a year instead of a couple days. That way, there's a context for the products that head of design Tom Dixon is developing, and you still get to keep up the voyeurism.</p> <p>Every day, people were passing in and out of \"my\" doors from 9am until after 6pm. While I cannot say that this was exactly relaxing, it is in keeping with our current fad for observed living. Each decade seems to go through its homemaking fads: 50s to mid-60s, the suburbs; early 70s, communes; now, with television's Big Brother and Castaway, it's voyeurism.</p> <p>Ironically, in Play Home, there wasn't a TV, which was a bit of a shame: it has the perfect couch-potato couch, complete with table for your crisps, pizza, beer, and I couldn't even try it out. But then, I was trying to go out every night.</p> <p>Does Play Home have a place today? Since the late 50s, when the Ideal Home Show clocked its greatest number of visitors, the trend for show houses has died a slow death in this country. Now, show houses such as the \"technology house\" or the \"home of the future\" just seem quaint. Still, such spaces might be experiencing a revival: people actually moved into show houses at the Ideal Home Show this past year, with a radio station broadcasting reports - sounds familiar?</p> <p>In other ways, too, Play Home is cutting edge, part of a new era of the seamless shopping experience, where retail and real life converge. Some New York stores are, in fact, real flats, only with everything inside for sale; Apartment even has a fictional couple \"living\" there. Given this, it should come as no surprise that Habitat is considering using Play Home as a store.</p> <p>I was lucky: moving in for a week is a great way to try out the furniture. But, in the true spirit of voyeur-vision, I know everyone wants to know what didn't work, what went wrong. In truth, nothing. I just got homesick. After five days, I crept over to my own house and realised I missed all my familiar stuff, not to mention my cats. It can be a little demanding living in a showcase. So I moved out a day early.</p> <p>Now, I'm happy to be back in SoLo (aka South London: well, you've got to try). Still, I know the sofa I want - Robin Day say my name.</p>",

At a slightly more decent hour, Habitat, creators of Play Home, had scheduled a training video shoot at the house - the idea is that the house should tell the \"story\" of its autumn/winter collection. I wasn't involved - or invited - but the early arrival of camera crew and lighting folks didn't exactly encourage me to spread out as if I really owned the place. So, while the night before Friend, Husband and I had flopped on every sofa in the place (that is some seven couches) and lounged on the basement's black and red (natch) sheepskin rugs, I made sure to tidy up before I went to work. Also, that night I was having a dinner party - a catered dinner party (I cannot get it up to host such affairs in my real life). People started arriving at 8pm; I'd greet them at the door with a \"Welcome to my house\", and after a glass of wine I actually believed it. Each floor served as a stage set for the evening. We started off in the ground-floor lounge, then graduated to the first-floor dining room and finally settled into the sex den. Well, there is no other way to describe the space, what with its red carpets, black walls, serpentine sectional sofa, card table and acres of sheepskin casually tossed about. Now, there is obviously something a bit odd about moving into a show house and living on parade, though Play Home is more private than some: it's intended mainly for the trade and press. Taking over a real house creates a sense of voyeurism, explains Stankus, \"like you're taking a sneaky look around someone's home\". The difference this time is that the house will remain on show for a year instead of a couple days. That way, there's a context for the products that head of design Tom Dixon is developing, and you still get to keep up the voyeurism. Every day, people were passing in and out of \"my\" doors from 9am until after 6pm. While I cannot say that this was exactly relaxing, it is in keeping with our current fad for observed living. Each decade seems to go through its homemaking fads: 50s to mid-60s, the suburbs; early 70s, communes; now, with television's Big Brother and Castaway, it's voyeurism. Ironically, in Play Home, there wasn't a TV, which was a bit of a shame: it has the perfect couch-potato couch, complete with table for your crisps, pizza, beer, and I couldn't even try it out. But then, I was trying to go out every night. Does Play Home have a place today? Since the late 50s, when the Ideal Home Show clocked its greatest number of visitors, the trend for show houses has died a slow death in this country. Now, show houses such as the \"technology house\" or the \"home of the future\" just seem quaint. Still, such spaces might be experiencing a revival: people actually moved into show houses at the Ideal Home Show this past year, with a radio station broadcasting reports - sounds familiar? In other ways, too, Play Home is cutting edge, part of a new era of the seamless shopping experience, where retail and real life converge. Some New York stores are, in fact, real flats, only with everything inside for sale; Apartment even has a fictional couple \"living\" there. Given this, it should come as no surprise that Habitat is considering using Play Home as a store. I was lucky: moving in for a week is a great way to try out the furniture. But, in the true spirit of voyeur-vision, I know everyone wants to know what didn't work, what went wrong. In truth, nothing. I just got homesick. After five days, I crept over to my own house and realised I missed all my familiar stuff, not to mention my cats. It can be a little demanding living in a showcase. So I moved out a day early. Now, I'm happy to be back in SoLo (aka South London: well, you've got to try). Still, I know the sofa I want - Robin Day say my name.",

      "body": "<p>It is May 9, Europe Day. Ragged, marching lines of schoolchildren enter the Klagenfurt town square waving the blue-and-gold flags of the European Union under a cloudless sky. Lining the square, Europe has set out its stalls: Euro pens; Euro hats; Euro stickers; and Roland Prinz, an executive of the Hypo Bank, in a tie decorated with samples of the new euro currency, is glowing with Euro-pride as he thrusts into people's hands postcards which, like his tie, depict the banknotes that in two years' time will replace the Austrian schilling. More and more children arrive, and the square is now filled with Euro people, who five years ago, before entry into the EU, were just Austrians living in the region of Carinthia, on the border of Italy and Slovenia.</p> <p>One school has marked the event by giving each child a placard listing one of the rights enshrined in the European charter: freedom to work; freedom of religion; equality before the law, no censorship. Another has handed every pupil a home-made sign with the flag of a different country bearing the word peace in its language. Paix! Shalom! It's the opposite of a Nuremberg rally - informal, undisciplined, all the racist poison sucked out of it. Except that, according to the programme, the keynote speaker is to be J\u00f6rg Haider, governor of Carinthia and, until his resignation earlier that year, leader of the far-right Freedom Party, a man now tagged as Europe's most dangerous racist and xenophobe. (Haider, however, denies that his anti-immigration policies are xenophobic or racist.) Someone says he has decided not to turn up, after all. Where is he? In Vienna. Yet rumours persist that he might yet show, for he is, it's said, a law unto himself, who travels by helicopter and, like God, can be anywhere at short notice. And so we look up at the sky, hoping to hear a heavy drone. </p> <p>Because of Haider, Austria is under EU sanctions, Israel has cut off diplomatic relations, tourism to the country has plummeted, and Austrians themselves, travelling abroad, are being greeted with a cold shoulder. Last year, on October 3, the Freedom Party (FPO) came second in the elections, throwing the country into political paralysis and sparking the largest protest demonstrations Austria has ever known. After months of agonising, in February the FPO was invited by the conservative People's Party, under the chancellorship of Wolfgang Schussel, to join a coalition, partly in fear that, if no government could be formed and fresh elections were held, the FPO would win outright with its appeal to nationalism and calls for measures to restrict the numbers of foreign workers allowed into the country. </p> <p>A couple of months before the end of Europe's most catastrophically violent century, people were talking once more of a new menace coming out of Austria. Was Haider the new f\u00fchrer, an Austrian dictator who would provoke a world war? The comparison between Haider and Hitler is probably hysterical. Periods of history are not templates that can be imposed on each other. Austria has a population of eight million, and it took one of its foreign workers, an Israeli who runs a fast-food stand near a U-Bahn station in Vienna, to put things into perspective: \"Germany in the 30s was a strong country; it had an army, an air force, a navy - things Hitler could use to get what he wanted,\" he said. \"This place? What's Austria got? Nothing. It's a country of no consequence. It's got no military. No industry. Ski slopes - that's all.\" </p> <p>We would be fools to believe that nazism is resurgent in Europe. Seventy years ago, totalitarianism was not imposed on the people; it was a political movement with mass and intellectual support. In his book, Dark Continent: Europe's Twentieth Century, the historian Mark Mazower describes the hostility to democracy among the thinkers and politicians of the right in the 20s who dismissed parliamentarianism as \"sluggish, materialistic, unexciting and incapable of arousing the sympathy of the masses\". The experiment in excitement was, of course, a disaster. Despite the endurance of a few skinheads, vandalism in Jewish cemeteries and an admiration for the racist and anti-Semite (formerly known as a historian) David Irving, there is no real taste for fascism in Europe these days. If there is anything to fear, we will find it rooted in democratically elected parties that want all the economic benefits of EU membership without the political consequences. </p> <p>A new vision of a Europe is emerging. Borderless inside, it would form a largely white fortress to stand against the alien hordes of Muslims and former communists that menace it from the east, a place that pays lip-service to a tolerance of Jews while focusing on the main agenda, which is to keep immigrants out. In an opinion poll carried out by the French National Human Rights Commission earlier this year, 68% of respondents agreed with the statement: \"The presence in France of people from non-European countries is disturbing.\" </p> <p>In Denmark, Pia Kjaersgaard, leader of the ultra nationalist Danish People's Party with 18% support in opinion polls, regards Muslims as \"as good a people as you or me, but it's a problem in a Christian country to have too many Muslims\". According to the Organi-sation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, Denmark is one of the world's richest countries, with the least success in incorporating foreigners into the workforce. Souhail Ibrahim, a Palestinian who left the Social Democrats in January to form an immigrants' party, told a newspaper, \"I don't think Austria will do half of what they're doing to foreigners in Denmark.\" In Belgium, the Flemish Vlaams Blok, based in its Antwerp stronghold where it attracts 15% of the vote in regional elections, calls for an immediate halt to immigration and the expulsion of unemployed immigrants who are there already. In Norway, the Progress Party, on 15%, wants to divert money spent on immigrants to pensions and health care for Norwegians. And in Britain, with no far right worth speaking of, Labour and Conservatives vie with each other to criminalise refugees and asylum seekers, driving them into detention camps. </p> <p>Who will be at the helm of this new Europe? Across the other side of Klagenfurt town square, Roland Prinz formally introduces me to a smiling, courteous man with a neatly trimmed beard. He gives me his card, which is decorated with the flag of the European Union and the coat of arms of Carinthia, and identifies the bearer as Dr Johannes Maier, Landesmanndirektion, EU-Koordinationstelle: he is the civil servant who advises Haider on European affairs. Maier was delighted to speak to the Guardian, \"a great newspaper\" he said, in contrast to the response to previous efforts to get an interview with Haider himself.</p> <p>We stood and shielded our eyes from the strong sunlight as the children paraded with their European flags. \"Mr Haider is not understood in Europe,\" he told me. \"Yes, he made mistakes in former times, but now he is trying to make policies like any other regional governor in Europe. Please remember, we are not against Europe, we are one of the weaker regions south of the Alpine line, one of the economically weakest regions of Austria and we profit from Europe - one billion schillings [\u00a345 million] a year. But if we look at Europe as a whole, we see that we have no great politician any more, like Mitterand and Kohl, someone who sees Europe as more important than the interests of his country.\" </p> <p>And is Haider that great man? \"Mr Haider is a very intelligent politician,\" Maier replied. \"He can speak very well and pronounce the problems of the people. He is one of the most important politicians now living.\" </p> <p>In Haider's 1995 treatise, a book called The Freedom I Mean, he sets out his vision not just for Austria but for Europe, and so for us, too: \"The concept of a 'multicultural society' has become an ideology,\" he writes. \"Any policy of immigration must insist on assimilation and adaptation to the culture and norms of the indigenous population... Especially in education we have to defend Christian values. As more immigrants bring their children into western Europe, the indigenous population is slowly being substituted by aliens. It's hard to understand why Catholic bishops and clerics march in the streets defending a multi-cultural utopia when the threat to Christianity is so obvious... </p> <p>From 1989-1992, 10,400 new jobs were created in eastern Austria and all of them were filled by cheap foreign labour. At the same time employment of Austrians declined by 1,300... For [our ruling politicians] it's more important to experiment with our youth as guinea pigs in abstract, multicultural programmes.\"</p> <p>And finally, in a grand sign-off: \"Our movement seeks to rally the friends of freedom to regenerate the old democracies and inspire the new. Our enemies are legion both in eastern Europe and the west, where the threats are more subtle and insidious. The road will not be easy, but the rewards will be worth the struggle. That is the challenge for Austria. That is the vision for Europe. That is the freedom I mean.\" </p> <p>Does this sound familiar - particularly the invocation of some hazily defined \"enemies\" on to whom the reader can pin any label he chooses? </p> <p>What is the Freedom Party? It can protest as much as it likes, but the records show that it is directly descended from Austrian National Socialism. In 1945, there were 500,000 registered Nazis in the country. Deprived of the vote until the 1949 election, they formed such a formidable force that neither Conservatives nor Social Democrats dared ignore them, and considerable numbers were absorbed into these two main parties.</p> <p>Immediately after the election, Austria's Nazis organised their own party, the Association of Independents, which split in 1955 but re-formed itself one year later as the Freedom Party. Haider's father, Robert, had joined the Hitler Youth in 1929 and later became a member of the Austrian National Socialists, joining the FPO on its formation. His son became party secretary in Carinthia in 1976 and, supported by the party's most right wing elements, overthrew its liberal wing to become leader in 1986. The last of the liberals left the FPO in 1993. In 1994, according to the Documentation Centre for Austrian Resistance, the FPO campaigned against Austria joining the EU \"using theories of worldwide conspiracies connected with barely concealed anti-semitic arguments\". </p> <p>The FPO's success in recent years is not necessarily because Austria's voters are covert Nazis but because of the corruption of the two main parties, the Conservatives and the Social Democrats, who have shared power continuously since the end of the war.</p> <p>What alternative do Haider and the FPO offer? A few days before I arrived in Carinthia, I sat in the office of the Documentation Centre's director, Wolfgang Neugebauer, the son of a former lieutenant in the SS, who has spent much of his life documenting Austria's Nazi past. He is a spare, blond man who at school, in the 50s, had come under the influence of socialists and somehow wrenched himself away from his father's fascism.</p> <p>\"Haider is a right wing extremist,\" he said. \"He is a racist and xenophobe. Not everyone in the party has the same opinions [as he does], but this is a f\u00fchrer party, a leader party, and he dominates it. After his retirement at the party congress, he still remains the most important politician in the party, and I'm sure that in the next elections he will be a candidate for the Federal Chancellorship. I am not afraid of some small Nazi groups in Austria. The greater danger is the coalition between a party like the FPO, with strong anti-immigrant and xenophobic policies, and a conservative party, and such developments can take place in other countries, too. Such a coalition can realise policy where small groups of extremists can't.\"</p> <p>Would Haider's election as Chancellor be comparable to the election of Hitler in 1933? \"No, I don't think so,\" he replied. \"This is not possible in Europe in this time, but I think he will try to realise his propaganda in the field of foreign labourers and immigrants. There will be a stop to further immigration and, perhaps, the expulsion of refugees. And there will be some reduction in freedom of opinion by cutting the subsidies for newspapers.\" </p> <p>In Vienna, I bought a copy of the Economist, because its cover story was about Europe's need for more immigrants. Because of the ageing of the baby boom generation, it stated, \"Europe's working population is falling, while Europeans' aspirations to do only clean, sedentary, well-paid jobs are constantly on the rise.\" It described a new sort of migrant, a \"labour tourist\", who shuttles \"resourcefully back and forth across an EU border, usually from eastern Europe into Germany and Austria, and often earns a living in the Union to support a family outside it.\" </p> <p>Economically, foreign workers are exactly what Europe needs but, to the Economist writer, this is being hampered by Europe's failure to adjust to being a continent of immigration, such as America or Australia, instead of a continent of nation states. Europe is currently desperate for workers trained in hi-tech skills, which India is now producing in huge numbers, but would-be emigrants are reluctant to go to Germany, where they are only offered short-term contracts with no right to bring their families. America pays more, and offers them and their families citizenship. </p> <p>The two men I bought the magazine from were victims of this myopia. They were immigrants from India. They had come 10 years ago on student visas to gain degrees in business studies, leaving their wives at home, and, like many non-white entrants to the country, had never been able to turn that initial entry into a work permit. One of them explained how the system operated: \"You apply for a job, and the boss of the company will give you a paper for the government labour office and they should give you permission to work, but a lot of people have been living here for up to eight years and every time they go to the government office, they say no, and this is much more common for Indians and Africans than for Yugoslavs.\" One of the anomalies of the new borderless Europe is that its non-citizens do not share the right to work in other EU countries. The two newspaper sellers were effectively resident in Austria, but not the EU. </p> <p>The only way they had found to earn a living was to work for a firm, which required them to take 100 copies a day of a newspaper called Kronen Zeitung, the country's most popular paper, similar in its appeal to our own Daily Mail. They were expected to sell 80 of these; if there was a shortfall, they had to pay for the unsold copies themselves. Being forced to sell Kronen Zeitung was a humiliation: \"The paper is always against foreigners. Every day there's more propaganda, and nobody talks about it, not the Social Democrats, not the Greens. They are always writing about Africans, saying they are drug dealers.\" Abuse and racist attacks from neo-Nazis wasn't the main problem. One of the men showed me the apartment rental ads in Kronen Zeitung and pointed out the line in almost every one that said, \"Austrians only\". They saw racism as sewn into the very fabric of the country. </p> <p>While we were talking, a man who was looking at Rolling Stone could no longer contain himself. \"In my opinion, Kronen Zeitung is a newspaper which manipulates everything, including photos,\" he said. He explained that recently the paper had run a picture of an anti-Freedom Party demonstrator hitting a policeman. A week or so later, it was exposed as the juxtaposition of two separate photographs. \"If you manipulate photographs and no one complains, what kind of a country is this?\" he asked.</p> <p>His name was Edward Boehler, he was 36, a veteran of the anti-Haider demonstrations, and he worked for an advertising agency. I asked him why people his age voted for the FPO. \"These are the new yuppies who are interested in their careers and not in immigrants,\" he said. \"They see themselves as the cool, clever people of the new century. They're not really interested in the roots of the Freedom Party. For them, it's the party that takes us very fast into the chic future. For myself, I would be very glad if in 10 or 20 years' time, Austria didn't exist any more. It's just a region. But I don't think many Austrians think this.\" </p> <p>In Britain, we are used to thinking of the right and the far right in a particular way: little Englanders, nostalgic for Britain's long-lost greatness, insular, conservative. In Austria, the reverse is true. Boehler's description of the FPO supporters' amputation of history helped me understand a puzzling conversation I'd had the night before over a drink in the area of Vienna known as the Bermuda Triangle, a maze of streets heaving with bars and restaurants, and full of the hip young people of Vienna, indistinguishable from their counterparts in London's Camden Town or New York's East Village.</p> <p>Here, I thought, I would hear the voice of young Austria, the anti-Haider forces who have led the demonstrations. So, sitting at a table outside the Casablanca bar, I asked the people at the next table, six old schoolfriends, all in their mid-20s, about Europe. They were all for it. They understood implicitly the advantage of being able to work and travel in other countries. Yet they confirmed that, politically, they were on the right and one of them, the most articulate, was an economics student who was sympathetic to the FPO. </p> <p>\"Haider says we must be newer,\" said Markus. \"The FPO is not racist. If they were, do you think I would have voted for them? It's a democratic party, and here in Austria we are a democracy. I know people who went to the demonstrations and it's their democratic right - in Austria, everyone has the right to say what they want.\" The other five nodded in agreement. The only girl with them said, \"If the FPO makes mistakes, they will not be in parliament.\" Once again, I understood how it was possible to build a party of the far right among people who consider themselves to be the same as their peers in other European countries, not special, or different, or secretly plotting a campaign for world domination. </p> <p>But what about the FPO's Nazi past? Had they studied the legacy of fascism in school? They all insisted that they had. As for the FPO, Markus pointed out, \"Most of the higher national socialists after the war went into the socialist and conservative parties. All the old Nazis were integrated without questions. It's strange, of course, but it's like in Russia with the communist party [some of whose members are now in government], and it was the same with us in 1945.\" When they themselves raised the question of immigrants, it was the refugees from the former Yugoslavia that concerned them.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,359076,00.html\">Read part two of 'Whose Europe is it anyway?' here</a></p>",

It's hard to understand why Catholic bishops and clerics march in the streets defending a multi-cultural utopia when the threat to Christianity is so obvious... From 1989-1992, 10,400 new jobs were created in eastern Austria and all of them were filled by cheap foreign labour. At the same time employment of Austrians declined by 1,300... For [our ruling politicians] it's more important to experiment with our youth as guinea pigs in abstract, multicultural programmes.\" And finally, in a grand sign-off: \"Our movement seeks to rally the friends of freedom to regenerate the old democracies and inspire the new. Our enemies are legion both in eastern Europe and the west, where the threats are more subtle and insidious. The road will not be easy, but the rewards will be worth the struggle. That is the challenge for Austria. That is the vision for Europe. That is the freedom I mean.\" Does this sound familiar - particularly the invocation of some hazily defined \"enemies\" on to whom the reader can pin any label he chooses? What is the Freedom Party? It can protest as much as it likes, but the records show that it is directly descended from Austrian National Socialism. In 1945, there were 500,000 registered Nazis in the country. Deprived of the vote until the 1949 election, they formed such a formidable force that neither Conservatives nor Social Democrats dared ignore them, and considerable numbers were absorbed into these two main parties. Immediately after the election, Austria's Nazis organised their own party, the Association of Independents, which split in 1955 but re-formed itself one year later as the Freedom Party. Haider's father, Robert, had joined the Hitler Youth in 1929 and later became a member of the Austrian National Socialists, joining the FPO on its formation. His son became party secretary in Carinthia in 1976 and, supported by the party's most right wing elements, overthrew its liberal wing to become leader in 1986. The last of the liberals left the FPO in 1993. In 1994, according to the Documentation Centre for Austrian Resistance, the FPO campaigned against Austria joining the EU \"using theories of worldwide conspiracies connected with barely concealed anti-semitic arguments\". The FPO's success in recent years is not necessarily because Austria's voters are covert Nazis but because of the corruption of the two main parties, the Conservatives and the Social Democrats, who have shared power continuously since the end of the war. What alternative do Haider and the FPO offer? A few days before I arrived in Carinthia, I sat in the office of the Documentation Centre's director, Wolfgang Neugebauer, the son of a former lieutenant in the SS, who has spent much of his life documenting Austria's Nazi past. He is a spare, blond man who at school, in the 50s, had come under the influence of socialists and somehow wrenched himself away from his father's fascism. \"Haider is a right wing extremist,\" he said. \"He is a racist and xenophobe. Not everyone in the party has the same opinions [as he does], but this is a f\u00fchrer party, a leader party, and he dominates it. After his retirement at the party congress, he still remains the most important politician in the party, and I'm sure that in the next elections he will be a candidate for the Federal Chancellorship. I am not afraid of some small Nazi groups in Austria. The greater danger is the coalition between a party like the FPO, with strong anti-immigrant and xenophobic policies, and a conservative party, and such developments can take place in other countries, too. Such a coalition can realise policy where small groups of extremists can't.\" Would Haider's election as Chancellor be comparable to the election of Hitler in 1933? \"No, I don't think so,\" he replied. \"This is not possible in Europe in this time, but I think he will try to realise his propaganda in the field of foreign labourers and immigrants. There will be a stop to further immigration and, perhaps, the expulsion of refugees. And there will be some reduction in freedom of opinion by cutting the subsidies for newspapers.\" In Vienna, I bought a copy of the Economist, because its cover story was about Europe's need for more immigrants. Because of the ageing of the baby boom generation, it stated, \"Europe's working population is falling, while Europeans' aspirations to do only clean, sedentary, well-paid jobs are constantly on the rise.\" It described a new sort of migrant, a \"labour tourist\", who shuttles \"resourcefully back and forth across an EU border, usually from eastern Europe into Germany and Austria, and often earns a living in the Union to support a family outside it.\" Economically, foreign workers are exactly what Europe needs but, to the Economist writer, this is being hampered by Europe's failure to adjust to being a continent of immigration, such as America or Australia, instead of a continent of nation states. Europe is currently desperate for workers trained in hi-tech skills, which India is now producing in huge numbers, but would-be emigrants are reluctant to go to Germany, where they are only offered short-term contracts with no right to bring their families. America pays more, and offers them and their families citizenship. The two men I bought the magazine from were victims of this myopia. They were immigrants from India. They had come 10 years ago on student visas to gain degrees in business studies, leaving their wives at home, and, like many non-white entrants to the country, had never been able to turn that initial entry into a work permit. One of them explained how the system operated: \"You apply for a job, and the boss of the company will give you a paper for the government labour office and they should give you permission to work, but a lot of people have been living here for up to eight years and every time they go to the government office, they say no, and this is much more common for Indians and Africans than for Yugoslavs.\" One of the anomalies of the new borderless Europe is that its non-citizens do not share the right to work in other EU countries. The two newspaper sellers were effectively resident in Austria, but not the EU. The only way they had found to earn a living was to work for a firm, which required them to take 100 copies a day of a newspaper called Kronen Zeitung, the country's most popular paper, similar in its appeal to our own Daily Mail. They were expected to sell 80 of these; if there was a shortfall, they had to pay for the unsold copies themselves. Being forced to sell Kronen Zeitung was a humiliation: \"The paper is always against foreigners. Every day there's more propaganda, and nobody talks about it, not the Social Democrats, not the Greens. They are always writing about Africans, saying they are drug dealers.\" Abuse and racist attacks from neo-Nazis wasn't the main problem. One of the men showed me the apartment rental ads in Kronen Zeitung and pointed out the line in almost every one that said, \"Austrians only\". They saw racism as sewn into the very fabric of the country. While we were talking, a man who was looking at Rolling Stone could no longer contain himself. \"In my opinion, Kronen Zeitung is a newspaper which manipulates everything, including photos,\" he said. He explained that recently the paper had run a picture of an anti-Freedom Party demonstrator hitting a policeman. A week or so later, it was exposed as the juxtaposition of two separate photographs. \"If you manipulate photographs and no one complains, what kind of a country is this?\" he asked. His name was Edward Boehler, he was 36, a veteran of the anti-Haider demonstrations, and he worked for an advertising agency. I asked him why people his age voted for the FPO. \"These are the new yuppies who are interested in their careers and not in immigrants,\" he said. \"They see themselves as the cool, clever people of the new century. They're not really interested in the roots of the Freedom Party. For them, it's the party that takes us very fast into the chic future. For myself, I would be very glad if in 10 or 20 years' time, Austria didn't exist any more. It's just a region. But I don't think many Austrians think this.\" In Britain, we are used to thinking of the right and the far right in a particular way: little Englanders, nostalgic for Britain's long-lost greatness, insular, conservative. In Austria, the reverse is true. Boehler's description of the FPO supporters' amputation of history helped me understand a puzzling conversation I'd had the night before over a drink in the area of Vienna known as the Bermuda Triangle, a maze of streets heaving with bars and restaurants, and full of the hip young people of Vienna, indistinguishable from their counterparts in London's Camden Town or New York's East Village. Here, I thought, I would hear the voice of young Austria, the anti-Haider forces who have led the demonstrations. So, sitting at a table outside the Casablanca bar, I asked the people at the next table, six old schoolfriends, all in their mid-20s, about Europe. They were all for it. They understood implicitly the advantage of being able to work and travel in other countries. Yet they confirmed that, politically, they were on the right and one of them, the most articulate, was an economics student who was sympathetic to the FPO. \"Haider says we must be newer,\" said Markus. \"The FPO is not racist. If they were, do you think I would have voted for them? It's a democratic party, and here in Austria we are a democracy. I know people who went to the demonstrations and it's their democratic right - in Austria, everyone has the right to say what they want.\" The other five nodded in agreement. The only girl with them said, \"If the FPO makes mistakes, they will not be in parliament.\" Once again, I understood how it was possible to build a party of the far right among people who consider themselves to be the same as their peers in other European countries, not special, or different, or secretly plotting a campaign for world domination. But what about the FPO's Nazi past? Had they studied the legacy of fascism in school? They all insisted that they had. As for the FPO, Markus pointed out, \"Most of the higher national socialists after the war went into the socialist and conservative parties. All the old Nazis were integrated without questions. It's strange, of course, but it's like in Russia with the communist party [some of whose members are now in government], and it was the same with us in 1945.\" When they themselves raised the question of immigrants, it was the refugees from the former Yugoslavia that concerned them.

The American 70s pop group Big Star topped the list with the horribly maudlin Sister Lovers. Big Star are, incidentally, the fave rave of no less than Gordon Brown, which doesn't bode very well for his marriage, as I've never met a woman who could stand more than two minutes of them. </p> <p>Anyway, all the usual suspects were there - Kurt Cobain, Nick Drake, Ian Curtis, Billie Holliday, Gram Parsons, Jeff Buckley - all of them dead, while the rest would be better off that way, to judge from the weeping and whining on show. Surprisingly to some people, the Smiths were nowhere to be seen, which backs up my theory that there was never anything slightly depressing about them, and that Morrissey was just having a laugh. Would that NME's editor, Ben Knowles, had similar access to his funny bone: \"Music can be the most incredibly positive and uplifting experience - but I wouldn't advise listening to too many of them in one sitting.\" (Thank you, Amos Starkadder.) </p> <p>To most women, such doomsaying is a complete and utter mystery, albeit a laughable one, as is the male attraction to depressing pop music; only four of the 30 records were by women, too. When gals get drunk, they want to dance to I Will Survive and Dancing Queen; when men get drunk, they want to hug the stereo and listen to Joy Division. \"Last night a DJ saved my life!\" goes a happy female disco hit from the 80s; men would rather listen to John Peel spinning The Sulking Scabs singing I Love You (But You're Dead) and make it worse. </p> <p>This is because, as I've said before, women largely lack the self-pity gene. Maybe it was bred out of them because their lives are so much tougher than men's (periods, childbirth, low pay, breast cancer, the menopause, some of them having to have sex with David Baddiel) that Nature realised that the addition of self-pity to this sorry stew would mean that the female population might commit ritual suicide on their 12th birthdays rather than tramp on through this vale of tears. </p> <p>Whatever the reasons, it was very sweetly summed up when the NME, in a follow-up to its chart, asked nine young recording artistes what their favourite sad songs were. While the eight men asked chose appealing-sounding songs such as Tractor Rape Chain and Buzzards And Dreadful Crows, the one little lady involved, Kathryn Williams, chose Astral Weeks by Van Morrison, because \"it just takes you somewhere else. If you're feeling a bit drowsy or down, it just perks you up. It makes you feel like you've been sitting in the sun all day.\" </p> <p>Isn't that adorable? The self-pity gene of this particular young woman was obviously just so inactive that she automatically turned the question inside out in her mind and changed it to \"What record makes you feel happy\", simply because, like most women, she couldn't see any point in making a drama out of a crisis. </p> <p>Whole musical genres have been built around male self-pity, which is often the flip side of narcissism - the blues (quite justifiable, what with slavery), folk, heavy metal and rap. This last is peculiarly vile and depressing in its puffed-up, queeny melodrama - if Eminem felt any more sorry for himself, he'd explode. Rap, which is massively male, is the wet blanket thrown on the black female joyfulness and optimism of dance and soul. With the black-on-black killing of young men at epidemic proportions in the US, rap is also more proof, if it were needed, that, despite what stupid old Lenny Bruce said about using it so much that it lost its sting, the word \"Nigger\" will always represent ignorance and loathing. Only now, it is self-loathing, too - leading, in turn, to more male self-pity, while black women look on the bright side and continue to climb the ladder of education and work. </p> <p>To judge by the way British boys are performing at school, they have also been listening to the siren song of self-pity on their Walkmans. \"Aww, shucks - if the system isn't going to be utterly weighted against girls like it was for the first 40 years of secondary school exams, I ain't gonna play! I'm gonna listen to my Eminem records, feel sorry for myself, never do my homework and, hey, I'll still be king of the world, because that nice David Blunkett is so worried about girls coming top for one lousy year that he'll soon have switched things around - less course-work, less poncy fiction-reading - so that boys are on top again!\" </p> <p>Take into account, also, that well into the 70s even grammar schools - those allegedly honourable centres of excellence - habitually adjusted the marks of boys and girls so that three-quarters of their pupils would not be female, and you have to ask yourself whether girls being on top academically may simply be the natural order of things, and one of the reasons God made men so big and strong. There's always going to be a demand for bin-men, navvies and strong-men at the circus - I don't know what Blunkett's getting in such a state about. </p> <p>But male self-pity is not always funny; sometimes, it serves as an excuse for the most loathsome sorts of behaviour. A handy catch-all clich\u00e9 that the ivory-tower-dwellers among us have been dishing up in an attempt to turn popular feeling against those appalling oiks in Paulsgrove (my God, I bet none of them has even read one Julian Barnes novel!) is, \"The abused, in turn, abuse\". This is, rather, one of the silliest and most easily disproved of modern myths. Some 90% of abused children are women; some 90% of child abusers are men. If it was really true that \"the abused abuse\", then 90% of all child abusers would be women, wouldn't they? </p> <p>But no - even in this arena, women who have suffered sexual abuse as children seem infinitely more likely to make a conscious effort to stop the cycle of monstrousness, and not to inflict it on anyone else.

The recent self-pity displayed by certain paedophiles has been awesome in its lack of self-awareness. But then, self-pity has always been the ecstacy of the worthless.

      "body": "<p>Towards the end of last year there was a flurry of lists published identifying the most significant figures of the past century and millennium. Apart from genius, the other factor that united the distinguished roll calls; Shakespeare and Mozart, Darwin and Galileo, Marx and Newton, was that most of the listees were dead. A rare exception was Professor Carl Djerassi, whose name earned an impressively high share of mentions. </p> <p>Djerassi, a 77-year-old organic chemist, has indeed had a distinguished career. As a young man his name was on the patent for the first antihistamines, he subsequently undertook pioneering work in the area of pest control and the 1,200 papers he has published in academic and scientific journals detailing his ongoing work bear witness to an astonishing productivity. But his place among the pantheon of influence was based on a single piece of research conducted nearly 50 years ago in a laboratory in Mexico City. It was there, on October 15 1951, that Djerassi succeeded in creating a man-made version of nature's contraceptive hormone, progesterone, that could be taken orally. This was the birth of the pill and Djerassi would ever after be known as its father. </p> <p>\"Yes I am proud to be called the father of the pill,\" he now says in his soothing mittel-European drawl apparently unaltered by the 60 years he has lived in America since leaving Nazi occupied Austria. \"But identifying scientists is really only a surrogate for identifying the inventions or discoveries. Maybe it is true that Shakespeare's plays would never been written if it wasn't for Shakespeare. But I'm certain that if we didn't do our work then someone else would have come along shortly afterwards and done it.\" </p> <p>This month has seen the 40th anniversary of the commercial availability of the pill. The long-standing debate as to its social, sexual, cultural and economic impact has been re-energised and broadened to take in the ethical issues arising from medical advances in fertility. </p> <p>While it comes as no surprise that Djerassi, despite his apparent modesty, should energetically join in the debate on questions such as the male pill, abortion and the improved techniques for artificial insemination, the medium in which he chooses to do it is unusual. Although he does appear on the international lecture circuit and takes an innovative postgraduate class on ethics at Stanford University in California, for the past decade or so his primary activity has been as a novelist, memoirist and playwright. It is through fiction that he has chosen to take on the thorny moral and practical issues thrown up by his research half a century ago. </p> <p>Djerassi has never been a typical scientist. He made his reputation as a chemist, but he has also been an astute businessman. He is a serious collector of art and owns one of the most significant private collections of Paul Klee's works in the world. As an admirer of the writings of Aldous Huxley, in the mid 1950s he personally tested out Huxley's claim that mescaline should be the opium of the intellegentsia when he and two students undertook a mescaline trip during a picnic at his house. He funded a spectacularly failed feature film in the mid-60s and has, for the past 20 years, been a benefactor to more than 1,000 writers, painters, choreographers and sculptors at an extremely successful artist's colony he founded on his California ranch. </p> <p>\"He's a scientist, artist, philosopher and mensch all in one,\" says Stephen Jay Gould who claims that Djerassi's book, The Pill, Pygmy Chimps, and Degas' Horse, \"is the very best of scientific autobiography\". Iris Murdoch said his 1989 debut novel, Cantor's Dilemma, was \"a brilliant tale of the morals and politics of contemporary science. Exciting, moving and brilliantly written\". David Lodge praises not only the content of his fictional output, but also his achievement in writing it all. \"It is amazing that a man of his age who has had such a distinguished scientific career has turned to literature and is so determined to succeed.\" </p> <p>Djerassi's chosen genre is \"science-in-fiction\", which is very different from science fiction because of its scrupulous scientific accuracy. In Cantor's Dilemma, which has sold more than 100,000 copies in the decade since publication, he explores the complex layers of trust between scientific colleagues. His next novel, The Bourbaki Gambit, takes on the cult of youth and the craving for name recognition in science when four distinguished old professors shake things up by pooling their work and publishing under a false name. His 1998 book, NO, illuminated the workings of the commercial bio-tech industry in relation to a pre-Viagra impotence cure. \"In the novel I use the example of Muse, which was a real invention before Viagra,\" he explains. \"But I changed the name to Musa, which is the botanical name for the banana. I still think that would have been a better trade name,\" he laughs. </p> <p>While undoubtedly revelling in this \"intellectual polygamy\", Djerassi also claims it is just a practical response to the challenges he has set himself. \"The more different ways we have of teaching certain difficult things the better off we are. I think that we as scientists should educate the public about the scientific and technological advances so that society can decide how best to use them. This is my missionary obsession.\" </p> <p>He says that the idea that scientists should make moral or ethical decisions about these issues is fundamentally wrong. \"Just because you have won a Nobel Prize doesn't mean you're qualified to make these important judgments. Ethics is a social construct and is something that society should establish. But in order to make educated decisions about this you must be aware of it.\" </p> <p>Djerassi has said that the most fundamental affect the development of the pill had on him was to gradually shift his interest from the \"hard\" science undertaken in the lab to the \"soft\" science of thinking about the social conse quences arising from scientific and technological developments. </p> <p>\"It is already possible to choose the sex of unborn children,\" he explains. \"The sperm of recently deceased men can be used to fertilise an egg. A woman could preserve millions of eggs when she is in her early 20s for use when she is post-menopausal in her late 40s. There is so much going on and the most important three-letter word in this century will not be \"sex\" but \"but\". For all of the wonderful opportunities these advances will throw up there will always be a but. These are things that interest me and this is what I want to start a debate about. But they are all grey questions and I don't say things are right or wrong.\" </p> <p>David Lodge agrees that Djerassi's fiction doesn't have a specific didactic aim. \"But he does have an informational or a pedagogic aim,\" says Lodge. \"He sees fiction as a means of communicating information about science and its moral and ethical implications. There is an explicit programme to bridge the two cultures.\" </p> <p>Lodge says that this tradition in literature can be traced back to Plato's dialogues, in which the interaction of characters is used to explore philosophical or political problems. \"There is a long and honourable tradition of using fiction to explore ideas but I think that Carl would hope that his novels were rather more mainstream than that. He does aim to interest you in the plight of his characters; their weaknesses and desires and ambitions.\" </p> <p>Djerassi himself acknowledges that such concern with literary history and technique is an unlikely turn of events. If there was a plan for his life it was that he should become a Viennese doctor like his parents. He says now that without Hitler's intervention that was what he would have become, living a bourgeois life and probably even voting for Kurt Waldheim as president. </p> <p>He was born in Vienna in 1923. His mother was an Ashkenazi Jew and his father Sephardic, but he says that their home life was virtually non-religious and medicine was everything. His mother was a physician who became a dentist and his father, a Bulgarian, was a doctor who specialised in treating venereal disease in the days before penicillin. Djerassi's Barmitzvah had to be postponed when a new, and lucrative, syphilis patient presented himself at his father's clinic. </p> <p>Although he remembers his early years as prosperous and enjoyable - he attended the same school as Sigmund Freud - in fact, things weren't quite as they seemed. Djerassi's parents had actually divorced when Carl was six but he didn't know this had happened until his early teens. </p> <p>The first few years of his life were spent in Bulgaria so when he returned to Vienna to go to school he didn't really think it odd that he only saw his father when he came to Vienna or when the young Carl visited him during the summer. \"I suppose I was simply too young and generally too happy to wonder that my parents didn't live together\". The truth eventually emerged when his father was forced to introduce a girlfriend to his son. </p> <p>In a strange echo of this a quarter of a century later, Djerassi himself was evasive to his children about his own first marriage, to a woman whom he had divorced before he married their mother. He had left details blank in a Who's Who entry and been vague about dates but when he eventually told his teenage daughter the truth he was relieved that she was more fascinated than traumatised by the revelation. </p> <p>When the anschluss took place in April 1938 it was his father's Bulgarian nationality that saved Djerassi's life. His father returned to Vienna from Bulgaria, re-married his mother and, by July, had taken her and the 14-year-old Carl out of the country. As soon as they were safe the marriage was again annulled. Djerassi's mother went to England to arrange passage to America, while the young Carl stayed in Bulgaria where he learned English. </p> <p>He didn't return to Austria until the late 1980s. \"I have felt very ambivalently towards Austria for many years,\" he says. \"They seemed to refuse to come to terms with their past in the way that Germany did.\" </p> <p>Although he had received many awards and honorary degrees from around the world, it wasn't until a few years ago that he received a call from the Austrian consulate enquiring whether he would accept an award for culture and science. He says he gave it a lot of thought before agreeing. \"When I finally did return I took the opportunity to walk around the city alone and I realised how beautiful it was, and still is, and what an extraordinary cultural mixture it represented. But it was a very bitter-sweet experience.\" </p> <p>The journey from Vienna he began in 1938 ended in New York a year later. While his father stayed in Bulgaria, Carl and his mother arrived in America virtually penniless. \"But despite everything I knew that getting an education was vital. I knew that would be my union card.\" He therefore took the remarkable step of writing to first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, to explain his situation. His letter was passed on to the Institute of International Education and after a short spell in a high school in Newark he was offered a scholarship to a Presbyterian college in Missouri. By 1941, when he was only 17 and due to, \"some administrative subterfuge\" because he hadn't officially graduated from high school, he completed his chemistry degree in a single year at Kenyon College in Ohio before going on to do Post-graduate work at the University of Wisconsin. </p> <p>Gilbert Stork, a fellow organic chemist, was a contemporary at Wisconsin and recalls Djerassi's extraordinary determination. \"He had and still has the incredible ability to keep his eye on the goal,\" says Stork. \"I remember him having this skiing accident. He had to make the very difficult decision whether to have an operation to remove his knee. This was at a time when replacement parts were not very good but he didn't hesitate for a moment. And not only does he still walk faster than most people, he even got a ski instructor to give him a technique for what amounted to skiing on one leg. He was determined that he wasn't going to be stopped skiing by the minor matter of losing a knee.\" </p> <p>Djerassi has given considerable thought to the roots of his overwhelming determination. He describes himself a workaholic but adds that, \"I'm not proud of that. I have always had the feeling that there is not enough time to get everything done\". </p> <p>He says that up until 1985, when he was 62, death was very much a theoretical concept. \"I really considered myself immortal in the same way that most young people consider themselves immortal.\" He was then diagnosed with cancer of the colon. In fact, Djerassi's health has been reasonably good since then but the episode marked a sea-change in the way he lived his life. </p> <p>\"I took a long time to value human interaction and spontaneity. If a student said they wanted to speak to me I wouldn't say 'sit down'. I would say 'how long do you want to talk for?' and arrange a meeting in a few days. That is insulting. It took me 50 years to realise I wouldn't like to be on the receiving end of this treatment and now if I do it at least I apologise for doing it.\" </p> <p>He says that if there is a hormone that characterises the scientific life it is testosterone. He talks about the machismo of working long hours and craving recognition from your peers. In fact he was rare among his scientific colleagues in that he had some interests outside the lab and did do things such as go to the theatre occasionally. \"But the idea that scientists undertake science purely for science's sake is not quite right,\" he says. \"We are curious but it is not just curiosity. There is also the desire for rewards. It was the same for me as well. I have lots of degrees and awards but the fact that I did not have an award from Austria for science is something that, if I didn't exactly mope around thinking about it all the time, it was something I was aware of.\" </p> <p>This remarkable sense of drive propelled Djerassi through the early years of his career. After four years as a research chemist he joined the Swiss pharmaceutical company, CIBA, which was based in New Jersey. It was one of the original powerhouses in steroids chemistry and medicine. In 1949 he was made an associate director at Syntex in Mexico City. He says it was a bold move to go south of the Rio Grande but he felt it was right as both he and Syntex had the same goal - to establish a scientific reputation. This was initially achieved in the highly competitive field of cortisone research, which had significant impact on the treatment of arthritis. The original research into what became the pill was not initially concerned with contraception but with certain types of menstrual disorders and cancer. Other people had thought of the idea of using progesterone as a contraceptive but it would have required daily injections. </p> <p>Djerassi's triumph was to develop a synthetic contraceptive that could be taken by mouth. While still working at Syntex as president of research, in 1968 he founded his own firm, Zoecon. It developed novel approaches to insect control, the gist of which is summed up in a chapter in his autobiography called How Do You Get a Cockroach to Take the Pill. </p> <p>As the 60s ended so Djerassi became an increasingly public figure. He was open in his opposition to the government policy in Vietnam and made it onto the White House enemies list - as disclosed during Watergate - because of his involvement in Senator George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, which included serving as a delegate at Democratic convention in Miami. It was therefore an uneasy occasion for both sides when, in 1973, Djerassi was presented with the National Medal of Science by a somewhat distracted President Nixon, on the very day that Spiro Agnew, the vice president, resigned. </p> <p>Gilbert Stork says that Djerassi was ready and waiting for fame when it arrived. \"To a considerable extent he expected to be famous. If anything, I suspect he thought it was slower in coming than he could have reasonably expected.\" </p> <p>Along with the fame he also acquired a considerable fortune: not from his right to the patent for the pill, for which he was given only $1 by Syntex - \"that was the usual deal and I was and am entirely happy with it\" - but from his ownership of stock in Syntex, which became a huge Wall Street success story, and then Zoecon. An original Syntex share cost $2. By 1993 they were valued at $8,000. He bought a large ranch near San Francisco which was called Smip - Syntex Made It Possible - and his collection of art swelled with works by the likes of Giacometti, Picasso, Henry Moore and Degas. \"I liked to collect painters who were also sculptors. I was always interested in people who don't just work in one area.\" </p> <p>But while he was increasingly professionally successful, his domestic life, already troubled, was about to be shattered. He had met his first wife when they were both at college at Kenyon and married her when he was a 19-year-old virgin. The marriage had ended after six years in 1949 when Djerassi moved to Mexico and asked for a divorce to marry Norma Lundholm, who was pregnant with Pamela, his first child. Ironically for the father of the pill, the pregnancy resulted from a broken condom.</p> <p> After his son, Dale, was born in 1953 he had a vasectomy. His mother's extreme possessiveness and repeated threats of suicide had been a contributory factor in the failure of his first marriage. When her behaviour threatened his new relationship he broke off contact with her, although he continued to support her financially. She returned to New York and resumed medical practice in a hospital. He didn't see her again until many years later, when she was suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease and did not recognise him. His relationship with his father, who came to live in America in 1949, was much better. From then until his death aged 96, they occupied neighbouring seats at the San Francisco opera. </p> <p>Carl Djerassi's marriage to Norma ended in 1976 and he is now married to the Stanford literature professor and biographer, Diane Middlebrook. Dale Djerassi is a film-maker who produced the film '68 with his then wife Isabel Maxwell, daughter of Robert. Pamela Djerassi was an artist who lived on the Californian ranch with her husband. She committed suicide in 1978, when she was 28. </p> <p>\"It was obviously the greatest tragedy of my life,\" Djerassi says. \"I wanted to mark her life by producing something living out of her death. Not a building or a statue.\" His response was to turn Smip - now named Sic Manebimus in Pace (\"Thus We'll Remain in Peace\") - into an artists colony. </p> <p>The area was very important to Pamela and, when hiking at the ranch with her, they used to stop at a beautiful small waterfall. He told his daughter this is where he would want his ashes scattered, never dreaming that this is where he would scatter hers. </p> <p>\"When I go to the ranch now I do think that this wouldn't have happened if Pamela hadn't died. Of course, that doesn't make it a good thing that she died, but at least something positive came out of it.\" </p> <p>The writer Vikram Seth and the composer John Adams, among many others, have passed through the colony. Alan Hollinghurst, the novelist, stayed there for a month while starting to write his novel The Folding Star. \"It's an extraordinary place. You travel down this terrifying route called Bear Gulch Road and you do feel you've gone into another world... Djerassi has a benign, but slightly remote presence at the ranch.\" </p> <p>The other thing Djerassi did after his daughter's death was to sell off the bulk of his art collection. \"It was very traumatic but I am now glad that I did it. I know now that physical possessions are far from being the only thing that matters. I realised I could do nothing for dead artists. But with an artist's colony I could support living artists.\" </p> <p>He has become a significant patron to many artists and a generous benefactor of art. The large Bill Woodrow sculpture in the lobby of the new British Library, of a massive book that is also a bench, was donated by Djerassi, who has a flat in Maida Vale in London and spends every summer here. </p> <p>He continues to collect work by Paul Klee, whose art was being vilified by the Nazis at about the same time as Djerassi was being forced to leave Austria. Most of the collection is now housed in a special gallery at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the museum will inherit the entire collection when Djerassi dies. Heather Whitmore Jain, the curatorial associate at SFMoma, looks after the collection. \"What is very interesting are the similarities between Djerassi and Klee. They are both renaissance men. Klee was obviously a very creative artist, but his art is so varied and he had this scientific and methodical side to him. For instance he systematically numbered all his work and Djerassi seems to share that combination of creativity and methodicalness.\" </p> <p>Throughout the time Djerassi was working in the commercial sector he also maintained an academic career. He was a professor at Wayne State University in Michigan and, in 1959, took up his current position as professor of chemistry at Stanford. He says he intends to be the first working professor aged 100. \"I've got a chance. My father didn't die until he was 96 and that was in an accident.\" He had a fall after an exercise session. </p> <p>His intellectual exploration of the social ramifications of his work has influenced his teaching, both in terms of subject matter and approach. He encouraged his ethics students at Stanford to write short stories. He even persuaded the prestigious Nature magazine to publish a piece of fiction for the first time in its history when the students illustrated an ethical dilemma in a renga - linked paragraphs written by different people - story. Djerassi pulled off a similar coup when the equally prestigious Science magazine included dialogue from his play about artificial insemination, An Immaculate Misconception. Orla Smith was the editor at Science who commissioned the piece. \"What attracted me about the play was that it is scientifically accurate. He was discussing real scientific issues in a very interesting way.\" </p> <p>Djerassi says that the key issue in the 21st century will be sex in an age of mechanical reproduction. \"It will change the relationship between men and women in a very fundamental way. Sex and reproduction can be separated. One will be for recreation while the other will be done under a microscope.\" </p> <p>An Immaculate Misconception was directed on BBC World Service radio by Andy Jordan, who will direct Djerassi's second play, Oxygen, co-written with the Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Roald Hoffmann, for the radio station this year. Oxygen, which looks at the culture and behavioural characteristics of chemists through the eyes of the Nobel Prize committee, will be the first play to be staged at the prize-giving conference in Sweden next year. </p> <p>For someone who has operated for so long in such contentious areas Djerassi has sustained comparatively few personal or professional attacks. He says the only trouble he gets usually comes from fundamentalists of all persuasions who attend lectures billed as being by the \"father of the pill\". </p> <p>\"They expect me to be either a male chauvinist pig or a pill pusher - or both. But that is not me. I believe in a contraceptive supermarket where all sorts of contraception is available that fits with people's own personal and cultural and religious and whatever other requirements. What I don't like is other people telling them what they can and cannot use. </p> <p>\"I do have an opinion about abortion. I believe in a woman's right to choose. I dislike the way the debate has been characterised as pro-life and pro-abortion. The pro-life people tend to be obsessed with life before birth but pay very little attention to it afterwards. Quite often the same people who are against abortion are also against gun control and for the death penalty. I think it is impossible to make abortion illegal, so we should all work together to make it unnecessary,\" he says. </p> <p>\"But rather than say my opinion I prefer to present the arguments to people and let them debate it.

      "bodyText": "Towards the end of last year there was a flurry of lists published identifying the most significant figures of the past century and millennium. Apart from genius, the other factor that united the distinguished roll calls; Shakespeare and Mozart, Darwin and Galileo, Marx and Newton, was that most of the listees were dead. A rare exception was Professor Carl Djerassi, whose name earned an impressively high share of mentions. Djerassi, a 77-year-old organic chemist, has indeed had a distinguished career. As a young man his name was on the patent for the first antihistamines, he subsequently undertook pioneering work in the area of pest control and the 1,200 papers he has published in academic and scientific journals detailing his ongoing work bear witness to an astonishing productivity. But his place among the pantheon of influence was based on a single piece of research conducted nearly 50 years ago in a laboratory in Mexico City. It was there, on October 15 1951, that Djerassi succeeded in creating a man-made version of nature's contraceptive hormone, progesterone, that could be taken orally. This was the birth of the pill and Djerassi would ever after be known as its father. \"Yes I am proud to be called the father of the pill,\" he now says in his soothing mittel-European drawl apparently unaltered by the 60 years he has lived in America since leaving Nazi occupied Austria. \"But identifying scientists is really only a surrogate for identifying the inventions or discoveries. Maybe it is true that Shakespeare's plays would never been written if it wasn't for Shakespeare. But I'm certain that if we didn't do our work then someone else would have come along shortly afterwards and done it.\" This month has seen the 40th anniversary of the commercial availability of the pill. The long-standing debate as to its social, sexual, cultural and economic impact has been re-energised and broadened to take in the ethical issues arising from medical advances in fertility. While it comes as no surprise that Djerassi, despite his apparent modesty, should energetically join in the debate on questions such as the male pill, abortion and the improved techniques for artificial insemination, the medium in which he chooses to do it is unusual. Although he does appear on the international lecture circuit and takes an innovative postgraduate class on ethics at Stanford University in California, for the past decade or so his primary activity has been as a novelist, memoirist and playwright. It is through fiction that he has chosen to take on the thorny moral and practical issues thrown up by his research half a century ago. Djerassi has never been a typical scientist. He made his reputation as a chemist, but he has also been an astute businessman. He is a serious collector of art and owns one of the most significant private collections of Paul Klee's works in the world. As an admirer of the writings of Aldous Huxley, in the mid 1950s he personally tested out Huxley's claim that mescaline should be the opium of the intellegentsia when he and two students undertook a mescaline trip during a picnic at his house. He funded a spectacularly failed feature film in the mid-60s and has, for the past 20 years, been a benefactor to more than 1,000 writers, painters, choreographers and sculptors at an extremely successful artist's colony he founded on his California ranch. \"He's a scientist, artist, philosopher and mensch all in one,\" says Stephen Jay Gould who claims that Djerassi's book, The Pill, Pygmy Chimps, and Degas' Horse, \"is the very best of scientific autobiography\". Iris Murdoch said his 1989 debut novel, Cantor's Dilemma, was \"a brilliant tale of the morals and politics of contemporary science. Exciting, moving and brilliantly written\". David Lodge praises not only the content of his fictional output, but also his achievement in writing it all. \"It is amazing that a man of his age who has had such a distinguished scientific career has turned to literature and is so determined to succeed.\" Djerassi's chosen genre is \"science-in-fiction\", which is very different from science fiction because of its scrupulous scientific accuracy. In Cantor's Dilemma, which has sold more than 100,000 copies in the decade since publication, he explores the complex layers of trust between scientific colleagues. His next novel, The Bourbaki Gambit, takes on the cult of youth and the craving for name recognition in science when four distinguished old professors shake things up by pooling their work and publishing under a false name. His 1998 book, NO, illuminated the workings of the commercial bio-tech industry in relation to a pre-Viagra impotence cure. \"In the novel I use the example of Muse, which was a real invention before Viagra,\" he explains. \"But I changed the name to Musa, which is the botanical name for the banana. I still think that would have been a better trade name,\" he laughs. While undoubtedly revelling in this \"intellectual polygamy\", Djerassi also claims it is just a practical response to the challenges he has set himself. \"The more different ways we have of teaching certain difficult things the better off we are. I think that we as scientists should educate the public about the scientific and technological advances so that society can decide how best to use them. This is my missionary obsession.\" He says that the idea that scientists should make moral or ethical decisions about these issues is fundamentally wrong. \"Just because you have won a Nobel Prize doesn't mean you're qualified to make these important judgments. Ethics is a social construct and is something that society should establish. But in order to make educated decisions about this you must be aware of it.\" Djerassi has said that the most fundamental affect the development of the pill had on him was to gradually shift his interest from the \"hard\" science undertaken in the lab to the \"soft\" science of thinking about the social conse quences arising from scientific and technological developments. \"It is already possible to choose the sex of unborn children,\" he explains. \"The sperm of recently deceased men can be used to fertilise an egg. A woman could preserve millions of eggs when she is in her early 20s for use when she is post-menopausal in her late 40s. There is so much going on and the most important three-letter word in this century will not be \"sex\" but \"but\". For all of the wonderful opportunities these advances will throw up there will always be a but. These are things that interest me and this is what I want to start a debate about. But they are all grey questions and I don't say things are right or wrong.\" David Lodge agrees that Djerassi's fiction doesn't have a specific didactic aim. \"But he does have an informational or a pedagogic aim,\" says Lodge. \"He sees fiction as a means of communicating information about science and its moral and ethical implications. There is an explicit programme to bridge the two cultures.\" Lodge says that this tradition in literature can be traced back to Plato's dialogues, in which the interaction of characters is used to explore philosophical or political problems. \"There is a long and honourable tradition of using fiction to explore ideas but I think that Carl would hope that his novels were rather more mainstream than that. He does aim to interest you in the plight of his characters; their weaknesses and desires and ambitions.\" Djerassi himself acknowledges that such concern with literary history and technique is an unlikely turn of events. If there was a plan for his life it was that he should become a Viennese doctor like his parents. He says now that without Hitler's intervention that was what he would have become, living a bourgeois life and probably even voting for Kurt Waldheim as president. He was born in Vienna in 1923. His mother was an Ashkenazi Jew and his father Sephardic, but he says that their home life was virtually non-religious and medicine was everything. His mother was a physician who became a dentist and his father, a Bulgarian, was a doctor who specialised in treating venereal disease in the days before penicillin. Djerassi's Barmitzvah had to be postponed when a new, and lucrative, syphilis patient presented himself at his father's clinic. Although he remembers his early years as prosperous and enjoyable - he attended the same school as Sigmund Freud - in fact, things weren't quite as they seemed. Djerassi's parents had actually divorced when Carl was six but he didn't know this had happened until his early teens. The first few years of his life were spent in Bulgaria so when he returned to Vienna to go to school he didn't really think it odd that he only saw his father when he came to Vienna or when the young Carl visited him during the summer. \"I suppose I was simply too young and generally too happy to wonder that my parents didn't live together\". The truth eventually emerged when his father was forced to introduce a girlfriend to his son. In a strange echo of this a quarter of a century later, Djerassi himself was evasive to his children about his own first marriage, to a woman whom he had divorced before he married their mother. He had left details blank in a Who's Who entry and been vague about dates but when he eventually told his teenage daughter the truth he was relieved that she was more fascinated than traumatised by the revelation. When the anschluss took place in April 1938 it was his father's Bulgarian nationality that saved Djerassi's life. His father returned to Vienna from Bulgaria, re-married his mother and, by July, had taken her and the 14-year-old Carl out of the country. As soon as they were safe the marriage was again annulled. Djerassi's mother went to England to arrange passage to America, while the young Carl stayed in Bulgaria where he learned English. He didn't return to Austria until the late 1980s. \"I have felt very ambivalently towards Austria for many years,\" he says. \"They seemed to refuse to come to terms with their past in the way that Germany did.\" Although he had received many awards and honorary degrees from around the world, it wasn't until a few years ago that he received a call from the Austrian consulate enquiring whether he would accept an award for culture and science. He says he gave it a lot of thought before agreeing. \"When I finally did return I took the opportunity to walk around the city alone and I realised how beautiful it was, and still is, and what an extraordinary cultural mixture it represented. But it was a very bitter-sweet experience.\" The journey from Vienna he began in 1938 ended in New York a year later. While his father stayed in Bulgaria, Carl and his mother arrived in America virtually penniless. \"But despite everything I knew that getting an education was vital. I knew that would be my union card.\" He therefore took the remarkable step of writing to first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, to explain his situation. His letter was passed on to the Institute of International Education and after a short spell in a high school in Newark he was offered a scholarship to a Presbyterian college in Missouri. By 1941, when he was only 17 and due to, \"some administrative subterfuge\" because he hadn't officially graduated from high school, he completed his chemistry degree in a single year at Kenyon College in Ohio before going on to do Post-graduate work at the University of Wisconsin. Gilbert Stork, a fellow organic chemist, was a contemporary at Wisconsin and recalls Djerassi's extraordinary determination. \"He had and still has the incredible ability to keep his eye on the goal,\" says Stork. \"I remember him having this skiing accident. He had to make the very difficult decision whether to have an operation to remove his knee. This was at a time when replacement parts were not very good but he didn't hesitate for a moment. And not only does he still walk faster than most people, he even got a ski instructor to give him a technique for what amounted to skiing on one leg. He was determined that he wasn't going to be stopped skiing by the minor matter of losing a knee.\" Djerassi has given considerable thought to the roots of his overwhelming determination. He describes himself a workaholic but adds that, \"I'm not proud of that. I have always had the feeling that there is not enough time to get everything done\". He says that up until 1985, when he was 62, death was very much a theoretical concept. \"I really considered myself immortal in the same way that most young people consider themselves immortal.\" He was then diagnosed with cancer of the colon. In fact, Djerassi's health has been reasonably good since then but the episode marked a sea-change in the way he lived his life. \"I took a long time to value human interaction and spontaneity. If a student said they wanted to speak to me I wouldn't say 'sit down'. I would say 'how long do you want to talk for?' and arrange a meeting in a few days. That is insulting. It took me 50 years to realise I wouldn't like to be on the receiving end of this treatment and now if I do it at least I apologise for doing it.\" He says that if there is a hormone that characterises the scientific life it is testosterone. He talks about the machismo of working long hours and craving recognition from your peers. In fact he was rare among his scientific colleagues in that he had some interests outside the lab and did do things such as go to the theatre occasionally. \"But the idea that scientists undertake science purely for science's sake is not quite right,\" he says. \"We are curious but it is not just curiosity. There is also the desire for rewards. It was the same for me as well. I have lots of degrees and awards but the fact that I did not have an award from Austria for science is something that, if I didn't exactly mope around thinking about it all the time, it was something I was aware of.\" This remarkable sense of drive propelled Djerassi through the early years of his career. After four years as a research chemist he joined the Swiss pharmaceutical company, CIBA, which was based in New Jersey. It was one of the original powerhouses in steroids chemistry and medicine. In 1949 he was made an associate director at Syntex in Mexico City. He says it was a bold move to go south of the Rio Grande but he felt it was right as both he and Syntex had the same goal - to establish a scientific reputation. This was initially achieved in the highly competitive field of cortisone research, which had significant impact on the treatment of arthritis. The original research into what became the pill was not initially concerned with contraception but with certain types of menstrual disorders and cancer. Other people had thought of the idea of using progesterone as a contraceptive but it would have required daily injections. Djerassi's triumph was to develop a synthetic contraceptive that could be taken by mouth. While still working at Syntex as president of research, in 1968 he founded his own firm, Zoecon. It developed novel approaches to insect control, the gist of which is summed up in a chapter in his autobiography called How Do You Get a Cockroach to Take the Pill. As the 60s ended so Djerassi became an increasingly public figure. He was open in his opposition to the government policy in Vietnam and made it onto the White House enemies list - as disclosed during Watergate - because of his involvement in Senator George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, which included serving as a delegate at Democratic convention in Miami. It was therefore an uneasy occasion for both sides when, in 1973, Djerassi was presented with the National Medal of Science by a somewhat distracted President Nixon, on the very day that Spiro Agnew, the vice president, resigned. Gilbert Stork says that Djerassi was ready and waiting for fame when it arrived. \"To a considerable extent he expected to be famous. If anything, I suspect he thought it was slower in coming than he could have reasonably expected.\" Along with the fame he also acquired a considerable fortune: not from his right to the patent for the pill, for which he was given only $1 by Syntex - \"that was the usual deal and I was and am entirely happy with it\" - but from his ownership of stock in Syntex, which became a huge Wall Street success story, and then Zoecon. An original Syntex share cost $2. By 1993 they were valued at $8,000. He bought a large ranch near San Francisco which was called Smip - Syntex Made It Possible - and his collection of art swelled with works by the likes of Giacometti, Picasso, Henry Moore and Degas. \"I liked to collect painters who were also sculptors. I was always interested in people who don't just work in one area.\" But while he was increasingly professionally successful, his domestic life, already troubled, was about to be shattered. He had met his first wife when they were both at college at Kenyon and married her when he was a 19-year-old virgin. The marriage had ended after six years in 1949 when Djerassi moved to Mexico and asked for a divorce to marry Norma Lundholm, who was pregnant with Pamela, his first child. Ironically for the father of the pill, the pregnancy resulted from a broken condom. After his son, Dale, was born in 1953 he had a vasectomy. His mother's extreme possessiveness and repeated threats of suicide had been a contributory factor in the failure of his first marriage. When her behaviour threatened his new relationship he broke off contact with her, although he continued to support her financially. She returned to New York and resumed medical practice in a hospital. He didn't see her again until many years later, when she was suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease and did not recognise him. His relationship with his father, who came to live in America in 1949, was much better. From then until his death aged 96, they occupied neighbouring seats at the San Francisco opera. Carl Djerassi's marriage to Norma ended in 1976 and he is now married to the Stanford literature professor and biographer, Diane Middlebrook. Dale Djerassi is a film-maker who produced the film '68 with his then wife Isabel Maxwell, daughter of Robert. Pamela Djerassi was an artist who lived on the Californian ranch with her husband. She committed suicide in 1978, when she was 28. \"It was obviously the greatest tragedy of my life,\" Djerassi says. \"I wanted to mark her life by producing something living out of her death. Not a building or a statue.\" His response was to turn Smip - now named Sic Manebimus in Pace (\"Thus We'll Remain in Peace\") - into an artists colony. The area was very important to Pamela and, when hiking at the ranch with her, they used to stop at a beautiful small waterfall. He told his daughter this is where he would want his ashes scattered, never dreaming that this is where he would scatter hers. \"When I go to the ranch now I do think that this wouldn't have happened if Pamela hadn't died. Of course, that doesn't make it a good thing that she died, but at least something positive came out of it.\" The writer Vikram Seth and the composer John Adams, among many others, have passed through the colony. Alan Hollinghurst, the novelist, stayed there for a month while starting to write his novel The Folding Star. \"It's an extraordinary place. You travel down this terrifying route called Bear Gulch Road and you do feel you've gone into another world... Djerassi has a benign, but slightly remote presence at the ranch.\" The other thing Djerassi did after his daughter's death was to sell off the bulk of his art collection. \"It was very traumatic but I am now glad that I did it. I know now that physical possessions are far from being the only thing that matters. I realised I could do nothing for dead artists. But with an artist's colony I could support living artists.\" He has become a significant patron to many artists and a generous benefactor of art. The large Bill Woodrow sculpture in the lobby of the new British Library, of a massive book that is also a bench, was donated by Djerassi, who has a flat in Maida Vale in London and spends every summer here. He continues to collect work by Paul Klee, whose art was being vilified by the Nazis at about the same time as Djerassi was being forced to leave Austria.
