The merger will create the world's largest travel company, but prompted uncertainty about the fate of Thomson's high-street rival Thomas Cook, in which Preussag holds a controlling stake. The deal with Preussag brings together mass market holiday brands such as Thomson in the UK with Preussag's TUI in Germany and Thomson's high-end Magic group with Germany's Robinson.

The 1m customers of Egg, unless they are employees, will not receive any free shares but they will be the only retail investors offered the opportunity to buy shares in the lossmaking operation. While the details of the free share offer to staff have started to emerge it is not yet clear to what senior executives, incld ing Mr Harris, will be entitled. Those details are expected to be contained in the prospectus for the flotation, which is due to be published next week before the shares are priced early next month. The City expects the allocation of shares to be generous. While Egg has said that it has not lost any key staff, Jonathan Bloomer, Prudential's chief executive, admitted last week that the flotation would make it easier to prevent staff deserting to rival dot.com operations which have been offering attractive share incentives to new employees. The City expects about 100 senior staff to be offered ad ditional incentives and share offers. The share option scheme for employees is expected to run over a three-year period. Customers of Egg and Pru bank will be limited to buying \u00a31,000 of shares, as will any employees deciding to buy shares. To avoid the problems incurred by Lastminute.com when the travel and shopping website floated, misjudging both the demand for and the price of the shares, Prudential, which is being advised by Goldman Sachs, will offer shares only through the internet and will take money from customers' current accounts only once the shares have been allocated.",

Bizarrely, he doesn't think he's any good. This is despite writing and singing the songs for a 20-piece band who are reinventing American music right before our eyes. </p> <p>Wagner and co's performance unveils a new twist on the old \"quiet storm\", a term invented by black American radio in the 70s to describe all those seduction songs by the likes of Al Green, Isaac Hayes and Luther Vandross that revel in a restrained eroticism. Despite coming from a supposed indie-country background, and looking like the PTA committee at some hicktown school, Lambchop use strings, horns and ageing keyboards to produce a graceful soul sound that whispers sweet nothings into your ear. Moving from gruff whisper to girlish falsetto, Wagner offers an extraordinary brand of conversational poetry - squabbling neighbours, apologies to long-suffering lovers - that celebrates the supposedly dull and downtrodden masses with a wry and profane wit. </p> <p>Pulled from this year's Nixon album, the live versions of The Old Gold Shoe and Up With People make recorded songs sound like demos. The crowning glories are versions of Curtis Mayfield's Give Me Your Love and Teddy Pendergrass's Love TKO, soul classics that your average white band would either castrate or camp up. But Lambchop are special, a labour of love hewn from a music lover's modesty. Kurt is right - if he got it, his ego would get in the way of this inspirational magnificence.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"I just don't get it. Maybe I'm not supposed to.\" Kurt Wagner, leader of Nashville's alt-country/soul wonders Lambchop, sits stunned by the audience's ecstatic reaction. Bizarrely, he doesn't think he's any good. This is despite writing and singing the songs for a 20-piece band who are reinventing American music right before our eyes. Wagner and co's performance unveils a new twist on the old \"quiet storm\", a term invented by black American radio in the 70s to describe all those seduction songs by the likes of Al Green, Isaac Hayes and Luther Vandross that revel in a restrained eroticism. Despite coming from a supposed indie-country background, and looking like the PTA committee at some hicktown school, Lambchop use strings, horns and ageing keyboards to produce a graceful soul sound that whispers sweet nothings into your ear. Moving from gruff whisper to girlish falsetto, Wagner offers an extraordinary brand of conversational poetry - squabbling neighbours, apologies to long-suffering lovers - that celebrates the supposedly dull and downtrodden masses with a wry and profane wit. Pulled from this year's Nixon album, the live versions of The Old Gold Shoe and Up With People make recorded songs sound like demos. The crowning glories are versions of Curtis Mayfield's Give Me Your Love and Teddy Pendergrass's Love TKO, soul classics that your average white band would either castrate or camp up. But Lambchop are special, a labour of love hewn from a music lover's modesty. Kurt is right - if he got it, his ego would get in the way of this inspirational magnificence.",

Meanwhile the Curse of Old Trafford award for, well, being cursed at Old Trafford goes to Andy \"how many yellows?\" d'Urso, who Roy Keane intimidated so much when he gave a penalty to the other side that he's been trying to prove his manhood ever since. So the big question for next year is: will he ever recover? We think not. But the one occasion that Clogger truly can't wait to see next season is the draw for the first group stage of the Champions League, which Uefa's general secretary Gerhard Aigner conducted with such charm this term. Which is why, although he may be young, Clogger is ready to reward his endeavour with a Lifetime Achievement Award for Services to Football. That's the thing about the Champions League, you see - the competition gets worse, but the draws just get better. David Davies, you have a long way to go. \u0095 \"Qualification for the Champions League at a club like this should be automatic.\" David Seaman objects to the pesky Premiership.",

      "trailText": "<p>Charities may be missing out on a whole sector of givers - the dead.  Nicola Hill  reports on legacies from beyond the grave</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Eight out of 10 people give money to charity during their lifetime but at \"deathtime\" only 5% leave money to charity in their will. Are fundraisers doing enough to plug this gap? Or are they going to miss out on the potential offered by the ageing population? </p> <p>Nina Botting, a planned-giving manager at the Tate Gallery says one of the reasons why fundraisers haven't converted more lifetime givers into so-called \"deathtime\" givers is because they are worried about the taboo of dying: \"Fundraisers haven't wanted to upset loyal supporters by asking them about a legacy.\" But Botting warns this is short-term thinking. \"A charity's supporter database is its best prospect for legacies and fundraisers shouldn't be so backward in coming forward.\" </p> <p>The challenge is on for fundraisers as the number of people who could leave a legacy increases. The market is set to expand as those born in the post-war baby boom become potential legators. There are currently 9.8m people over the age of 60. In 30 years' time this figure will have increased to 20m. Not only is the ageing population increasing but they are generally wealthier than their forebears. </p> <p>However, Kevin Waudby, legacy marketing manager at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), says it is difficult to predict what impact the ageing population will have on legacies. \"Unlike their parents, baby boomers don't see charitable giving as a civic duty.\" He claims that fundraisers will have to work harder to appeal to the feel-good factor which motivates baby boomers to give. </p> <p>Smee and Ford is a company specialising in legacy information. Its director, Richard Radcliffe, points out that some of the wealth may be eroded by the high cost of nursing care. </p> <p>But it is not just external factors which fundraisers need to heed. Some fundraising techniques are putting people off leaving money to charities. \"Direct marketing, telephone fundraising and approaching people on the street can make them change their wills.\" Radcliffe's research also revealed that people make false pledges, pretending to fundraisers that they have left money in their will.

      "bodyText": "Eight out of 10 people give money to charity during their lifetime but at \"deathtime\" only 5% leave money to charity in their will. Are fundraisers doing enough to plug this gap? Or are they going to miss out on the potential offered by the ageing population? Nina Botting, a planned-giving manager at the Tate Gallery says one of the reasons why fundraisers haven't converted more lifetime givers into so-called \"deathtime\" givers is because they are worried about the taboo of dying: \"Fundraisers haven't wanted to upset loyal supporters by asking them about a legacy.\" But Botting warns this is short-term thinking. \"A charity's supporter database is its best prospect for legacies and fundraisers shouldn't be so backward in coming forward.\" The challenge is on for fundraisers as the number of people who could leave a legacy increases. The market is set to expand as those born in the post-war baby boom become potential legators. There are currently 9.8m people over the age of 60. In 30 years' time this figure will have increased to 20m. Not only is the ageing population increasing but they are generally wealthier than their forebears. However, Kevin Waudby, legacy marketing manager at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), says it is difficult to predict what impact the ageing population will have on legacies. \"Unlike their parents, baby boomers don't see charitable giving as a civic duty.\" He claims that fundraisers will have to work harder to appeal to the feel-good factor which motivates baby boomers to give. Smee and Ford is a company specialising in legacy information. Its director, Richard Radcliffe, points out that some of the wealth may be eroded by the high cost of nursing care. But it is not just external factors which fundraisers need to heed. Some fundraising techniques are putting people off leaving money to charities. \"Direct marketing, telephone fundraising and approaching people on the street can make them change their wills.\" Radcliffe's research also revealed that people make false pledges, pretending to fundraisers that they have left money in their will. In a recent focus group, 90% of pledgers admitted that they had not pledged, even though they said they had. Radcliffe believes legacy fundraising needs to be much friendlier and less intrusive. In fact he advocates not even asking people to leave a bequest. \"The key to fundraising is the 'ask' but in legacy fundraising this shouldn't happen.\" Radcliffe thinks fundraisers, or preferably volunteers, should spend time trying to understand the motivations of potential legators.

      "body": "<p>There was a Christian rally in the park over the river from the County Ground yesterday. Games were played in the afternoon heat, songs were sung and there was some talk of salvation. Evidently nobody thought of popping over the bridge for some missionary work by trying to save this sleepy cricket match, which needed nothing less than divine intervention. </p> <p>And so the modest crowd, who had little else to do by all accounts, suffered in silence. They will get their reward in heaven. In these days of bribery and match-fixing allegations, the phrases \"collusion\" and \"contrived finish\" are on a par with \"confidence trick\" and \"card-sharp\". You wouldn't touch them with Darren Gough's spare thigh pad. </p> <p>So once the first day of this match and much of the second had been washed out, the chances of anything more meaningful than mere pre-test practice for the tourists completely disappeared. </p> <p>Last year Essex collected \u00a31,000 per man from the Vodafone award scheme, the bonuses given to counties who beat the tourists, when they ambushed New Zealand. Yesterday they settled for splitting \u00a32,750 as the match ended in a predictable draw with Zimbabwe 75 for none in their second innings. </p> <p>Except for the Zimbabwean openers Grant Flower and Trevor Gripper, who were just starting to fill their boots against some indifferent bowling, the end came not a moment too soon. </p> <p>But the tourists have gained some positives from the weekend. Neil Johnson made 83 and then took three wickets with his seamers to collect the man of the match award. Guy Whittall, competing with Stuart Carlisle for a test spot, made 54 and took two cheap wickets including that of the England captain Nasser Hussain.

      "bodyText": "There was a Christian rally in the park over the river from the County Ground yesterday. Games were played in the afternoon heat, songs were sung and there was some talk of salvation. Evidently nobody thought of popping over the bridge for some missionary work by trying to save this sleepy cricket match, which needed nothing less than divine intervention. And so the modest crowd, who had little else to do by all accounts, suffered in silence. They will get their reward in heaven. In these days of bribery and match-fixing allegations, the phrases \"collusion\" and \"contrived finish\" are on a par with \"confidence trick\" and \"card-sharp\". You wouldn't touch them with Darren Gough's spare thigh pad. So once the first day of this match and much of the second had been washed out, the chances of anything more meaningful than mere pre-test practice for the tourists completely disappeared. Last year Essex collected \u00a31,000 per man from the Vodafone award scheme, the bonuses given to counties who beat the tourists, when they ambushed New Zealand. Yesterday they settled for splitting \u00a32,750 as the match ended in a predictable draw with Zimbabwe 75 for none in their second innings. Except for the Zimbabwean openers Grant Flower and Trevor Gripper, who were just starting to fill their boots against some indifferent bowling, the end came not a moment too soon. But the tourists have gained some positives from the weekend. Neil Johnson made 83 and then took three wickets with his seamers to collect the man of the match award. Guy Whittall, competing with Stuart Carlisle for a test spot, made 54 and took two cheap wickets including that of the England captain Nasser Hussain. And Henry Olonga, once regarded as the rabbit's rabbit, somehow contrived to make a career-best 45. Olonga's bowling too was sharp, albeit relatively expensive, on a pitch that remained helpful throughout. He will form a testing partnership with Heath Streak, who has been netting gingerly and seems certain to play at Lord's. Of most interest, though, was the bowling of Pommie Mbangwa, who took two for 47 from 30 overs. He runs in busily and delivers briskly rather than fast, but swung the ball away late at times to a disciplined line of off-stump to a deep-set field. It is this which could produce stalemate cricket at Lord's. In the winter, Hansie Cronje needed little bidding to set such fields once the shine had gone from the new ball, hoping for an indiscretion. England, and Hussain in particular, would have little to do with it then, and yesterday Hussain showed he has lost none of his own discipline. He took 20 minutes to add to his overnight 17 and batted 12 minutes short of three hours for 33, before heaving wildly at another wide one and getting himself caught behind. Zimbabwe will not find him so accommodating come Thursday.",

      "body": "<p>They sat together in a raggedy circle near the middle of an empty cricket ground in Chelmsford. Fifteen Zimbabwean cricketers looked down and fiddled with their boots or picked at stray tufts of grass as they listened to the urgent voice of the man they had gathered around one afternoon last week. Andy Flower spoke with a stony hardness which once, in more ordinary times, might have seemed incongruous when set against his pretty surname. </p> <p>Yet Flower is not a man given to soft prattling on even the happiest of occasions - and these are bleak days for Zimbabwe and their lost cricketers. On a sunlit field in Essex, 6,000 miles away from the farms and cities of a darkening country they still call home, the need for blunt talk was paramount. </p> <p>Flower scanned the lowered heads of the 11 white and four young black men who make up his squad. He knew them inside out. Starting with his brother, Grant, the 32-year-old captain's gaze moved to his deputy, Heath Streak, who was one of six in the forlorn party to come from a farming background. Streak had arrived in England a few days after the others. </p> <p>The big fast bowler and his father, Denis, had been forced to draw up contingency plans for the terrifying event of further trouble on their cattle farm 45 miles outside Bulawayo. Although Denis Streak had managed to \"placate the 20 or so invaders\" who arrived at their gates in mid-April, a fourth Zimbabwean farmer had been murdered the previous Sunday. </p> <p>Even Streak's jocular fast-bowling partner, the dreadlock-swinging, opera-singing Henry Olonga, was bowed and silent. Olonga and Streak, the black and white icons of Zimbabwean cricket, had known each other since they went to the same junior school. </p> <p>\"I don't sing as well as Henry,\" Streak told me, \"but we've come a long way together. As a kid he was shy and reclusive - not that you'd believe that now.\" </p> <p>Sitting alongside him, 16-year-old Tatenda Taibu was half the age of his captain. He and Flower both played for the same club in Harare, the quaintly-named Old Winstonians. </p> <p>Even though Olonga had been Zimbabwe's first black Test cricketer, the cherubic Taibu insisted that \"I only have two heroes. As a batsman I love Sachin Tendulkar. I model myself on him because he is also very short. I want to break all his batting records. But as a wicketkeeper and a Zimbabwean I can only see an idol in Andy Flower. We have something between us. The first day he saw me play he gave me his gloves. He's been my teacher ever since.\" </p> <p>Taibu had also told me that \"the stuff at home is difficult for the other guys. But I'm only 16. I've got nothing to do with all these problems. I just want to focus on cricket.\" </p> <p>It was a simple message which Flower, in the centre of his fraught ring, used to underpin his passionate speech. His words were plain but forceful. After the pain which had trailed them for two months, they knew each other's strengths and weaknesses better than ever before. Doubt and fear had split a once united team. It was time to seal the cracks. </p> <p>There was no need even to mention David Lloyd. Three years ago, after a drawn series in Zimbabwe, the former England coach had made his notorious \"we flippin' murdered 'em\" comment. Life and death in Zimbabwe had become too serious to reach for glib cricketing jibes. It was time to look forward. Slowly, the heads began to lift. </p> <p>Within 10 minutes, just like any other team intent on delaying a return to fielding practice, they were running and whooping as a frenetic game of eight-a-side football reeled across Essex's county ground. Their skill in controlling a cricket ball with their feet might have been suspect but the old camaraderie was unmistakable. </p> <p>Jeff Thomson, the great Australian fast bowler, tossed his silvery mane as the helter-skelter game swept across the outfield. When he joined Zimbabwe as their specialist bowling coach a week earlier, Thomson had grunted that \"they're tough buggers. In the same circumstances an English or even an Australian team would've packed their bags and gone home...\" </p> <p>The team manager Dan Stannard had spent the entire tour rejecting each new headline which suggested that the Zimbabweans were actually about to board the next plane to Harare. At the same time, he fought hard to stay relentlessly cheery, for his own son worked on a farm in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>\"We've turned things around,\" Stannard stressed. \"There's no point denying the team were down. They were disappointed in the West Indies and some returned to Zimbabwe for a few days. Others flew straight here. We came to England as a very fragmented unit.\" </p> <p>Against Hampshire in their first match, not even rain could dampen a sparkling partnership between Alistair Campbell, who made 150, and Taibu, whose 36 runs were a glorious cameo of youthful assurance. Yet afterwards, to share a few days with the Zimbabweans in Canterbury, where they were humiliated by Kent, was to witness a team facing ruin. Flower even made a grim admission. The tour was on the brink of collapse. </p> <p>\"It was bitterly cold in Canterbury,\" Stannard agreed, \"and our minds were elsewhere. There were also some internal problems in the squad. The players had been under real strain. But we sat down and talked about the situation in a very transparent way. The mood is now upbeat. We're in England until late July and we're determined to make this a winning tour.\" </p> <p>A more reliable guide as to how they might fare against England in the first test at Lords on Thursday can be found in their recent West Indian trials. \"It was a strange tour, and the first Test was the strangest time of all,\" explained Neil Johnson, Zimbabwe's best player alongside Flower. \"For four days we really hurt the West Indies. They were on the rack. We only needed to score 99 in our second innings to win. </p> <p>\"We knew it would be hard on that track with Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh steaming in. So the plan was that I would attack them from the start. But I hit a long-hop straight to point. They didn't bowl a bad ball after that. We were all out for 67. </p> <p>\"It was disheartening because we had outplayed them for so long. Even in the second test we scored 300 in the first innings and had them rocking at 120 for 5. But a few decisions went against us. We should have won that series 2-0. It just went wrong.\" </p> <p>Olonga's dreads flapped in agitation. \"It was terrible! The news in Zimbabwe turned bad as soon as we arrived in the Caribbean. The atmosphere became pretty sour. Things are better now, but it's often hard to find motivation. Cricket is just a game - what's happening at home is serious.\" </p> <p>Yet even political gravity could not curb Olonga. \"This is still a cricket tour. It has the same old routine: get on the bus, go to the ground, practise or play, get back on the bus and arrive at a new hotel which looks the same as the one you'd left that morning. It kills me!\" </p> <p>Olonga had hit his high-camp stride. \"I paint, I draw, I sing. I've done drama. I've enjoyed a multi-faceted life and, for some, this makes me a weirdo. But I have the ability to be more than just a cricketer. It all began when I was 14 and [was] offered a minor role as a girl in Oklahoma. </p> <p>\"They told me I was the ugliest girl the world of theatre had ever seen. I vowed from then on to only go for the good-looking parts. The next time they were looking for a lead it turned out that I could reach all the high notes. I could sing.\" </p> <p> \"But I'm not sure where this opera thing comes from. I can learn an Italian aria but, to be honest, I don't even know five operas. I want to move into R 'n' B and pop. I've got the groove.\" </p> <p>According to the Zimbabwe coach Andy Pycroft, Olonga has also found his bowling groove. \"Henry used to be wild, like a spray-gun, but his control now matches his incredible strike-rate. He's a gifted feller. Youngsters like Tatenda Taibu are following him. A quarter of this squad is black - and that's on merit. </p> <p>\"Soccer might be more popular in Zimbabwe, but cricket is closing the gap. Black kids are taking up cricket in vast numbers. We're the only Zimbabweans playing sport at the highest level and have a great chance to lift the whole country. We're not here to compete under duress. We're here to win - starting at Lords.\" </p> <p>Johnson has particularly fond memories of the St John's Wood ground where, in the World Cup, he scored 132 not out against Australia. \"Lords is huge,\" Johnson marvelled. \"I take photographs whenever I visit the place. We've been waiting to take on England for a long time there. They're not so patronising now - they also expect a real contest. They know we can shock anyone.\" </p> <p>Heath Streak ambled over, his eyes alight at the prospect. The meaty farming man rubbed his injured knee in real hope that he too might play his part. \"It's still swollen,\" he sighed, \"but I'd better make it. My family are coming over specially to watch us at Lords. It'll be good to see them again. Even though we try to keep in touch it's not the same as seeing them safe and sound. </p> <p>\"They're still on the farm. We try not to worry but I'd be lying if I said it was ever far from our minds. A lot of us, both black and white, have been through terrible pain in Zimbabwe. All we can do is hope and pray that peace will eventually return. The country deserves it. Until then, we just have to stay tough on this tour. After all, we're the lucky ones. We're the guys who, once in a while, get a chance to just think about cricket...\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Strange the potency of cheap music, as someone (it might have been Tony Blackburn) once said, and as the BBC proved in Match of the Day - The Musical yesterday morning. </p> <p>Pavarotti, for instance. At this remove, his Nessun Dorma, played to death and scuffed and worn like a pair of old shoes at the back of the cupboard, might sound a little cheesy, but seeing again the montage sequence with which the BBC tied up their coverage of the 1990 World Cup, it was clear that this was nothing less than the rebirth of soccer; and without the soundtrack it was nothing. </p> <p>More than Sky, more than the refreshing of our old stadiums, more than the influx of foreign stars, we have Puccini to thank for the robust and wealthy state of our national game. </p> <p>The Italia 90 re-run was part of a montage of montages dug up by the BBC to fill the Match of the Day Sunday morning repeat slot in the absence of any Premiership action from Saturday. While most of the goals, saves and fluffs were achingly familiar, it was interesting to note how the influence of Sky, whose closing musical sequences are often the best part of their Premiership coverage, has swung the BBC away from the classics towards rather dreary Britpop. </p> <p>Maybe it is an age thing with me, but the more recent medleys - Manchester United's treble, a celebration of Brazilian football - seemed to have been cut to some relatively undistinguished pop music with which I was not familiar, while the BBC's greatest hits enjoyed the better tunes - C'est Si Bon for David Ginola, Mad About The Boy for Michael Owen, I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair for a bad haircut selection from the 1994 World Cup. </p> <p>The week's wackiest combination of music and haircut, however, belonged to Henry Olonga, Zimbabwe's first black cricketer, a guest on John Inverdale's On Side, television's first attempt, I believe, to combine a chat show with the Crystal Maze. </p> <p>The On Side set, clearly designed by people who find the paintings of Salvador Dali rather too literal for their taste, seems to grow each time I watch the show. The effect is that guests, as they wander down the long corridor to join Invers, to the accompaniment of some spooky guitar music, now seem to be trapped in Ikea. \"I've bought a lampshade, I've eaten the meatballs. Let me out,\" you half expect them to shout. </p> <p>What Olonga did was even stranger. He sang opera, a capella. To realise how weird this was, you have to know a little about Olonga's appearance. The bowler manages to combine the speaking voice of Ralph Fiennes with the looks of, well, I hardly like to say. Golden dreadlocks perched somewhat uncomfortably atop smooth, brown, finely chiselled features; it's the love child of Victor Lewis-Smith and Grace Jones, if that is not too terrible a thought for a family newspaper on a Monday morning. </p> <p>Olonga's ditty was called Tristesse, an Italian song he apparently heard on a Jose Carreras album. He just stood up and started singing - the whole thing - while Inverdale listened. It is not easy being sung to, as anyone who has ever appeared in a musical will attest, but Invers made a reasonably good fist of looking enraptured, whereas a lesser man might have told Henry to sit down and shut up. </p> <p>Just to add to the oddness of it all, Inverdale was sporting a black eye, which I suspect he did not receive in the course of his chat-show duties.

      "bodyText": "Strange the potency of cheap music, as someone (it might have been Tony Blackburn) once said, and as the BBC proved in Match of the Day - The Musical yesterday morning. Pavarotti, for instance. At this remove, his Nessun Dorma, played to death and scuffed and worn like a pair of old shoes at the back of the cupboard, might sound a little cheesy, but seeing again the montage sequence with which the BBC tied up their coverage of the 1990 World Cup, it was clear that this was nothing less than the rebirth of soccer; and without the soundtrack it was nothing. More than Sky, more than the refreshing of our old stadiums, more than the influx of foreign stars, we have Puccini to thank for the robust and wealthy state of our national game. The Italia 90 re-run was part of a montage of montages dug up by the BBC to fill the Match of the Day Sunday morning repeat slot in the absence of any Premiership action from Saturday. While most of the goals, saves and fluffs were achingly familiar, it was interesting to note how the influence of Sky, whose closing musical sequences are often the best part of their Premiership coverage, has swung the BBC away from the classics towards rather dreary Britpop. Maybe it is an age thing with me, but the more recent medleys - Manchester United's treble, a celebration of Brazilian football - seemed to have been cut to some relatively undistinguished pop music with which I was not familiar, while the BBC's greatest hits enjoyed the better tunes - C'est Si Bon for David Ginola, Mad About The Boy for Michael Owen, I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair for a bad haircut selection from the 1994 World Cup. The week's wackiest combination of music and haircut, however, belonged to Henry Olonga, Zimbabwe's first black cricketer, a guest on John Inverdale's On Side, television's first attempt, I believe, to combine a chat show with the Crystal Maze. The On Side set, clearly designed by people who find the paintings of Salvador Dali rather too literal for their taste, seems to grow each time I watch the show. The effect is that guests, as they wander down the long corridor to join Invers, to the accompaniment of some spooky guitar music, now seem to be trapped in Ikea. \"I've bought a lampshade, I've eaten the meatballs. Let me out,\" you half expect them to shout. What Olonga did was even stranger. He sang opera, a capella. To realise how weird this was, you have to know a little about Olonga's appearance. The bowler manages to combine the speaking voice of Ralph Fiennes with the looks of, well, I hardly like to say. Golden dreadlocks perched somewhat uncomfortably atop smooth, brown, finely chiselled features; it's the love child of Victor Lewis-Smith and Grace Jones, if that is not too terrible a thought for a family newspaper on a Monday morning. Olonga's ditty was called Tristesse, an Italian song he apparently heard on a Jose Carreras album. He just stood up and started singing - the whole thing - while Inverdale listened. It is not easy being sung to, as anyone who has ever appeared in a musical will attest, but Invers made a reasonably good fist of looking enraptured, whereas a lesser man might have told Henry to sit down and shut up. Just to add to the oddness of it all, Inverdale was sporting a black eye, which I suspect he did not receive in the course of his chat-show duties. He is geniality itself, and even Stan Collymore, another of last week's guests, seemed unlikely to bop him one. Inverdale went over familiar Stan ground - Ulrika, the fire extinguisher, the incident with the concrete mixer (actually I may have imagined one of those) - which the striker spoke about entirely in footballer-speak. Describing his decision to seek professional help, he said: \"I hadn't been going as well as I should have done, as a person.\" Interesting. Perhaps it's all part of the therapy. Collymore had left by the time Olonga went into his party piece, and it is possible I misread Invers's expression as, \"Where is Stan with a fire extinguisher when you really need him?\" Pity he wasn't booked for Stockholm. All right, I know the Eurovision Song Contest is not strictly speaking a sporting occasion, and more expert eyes will no doubt be cast over the event elsewhere in the newspaper, but given the imminence of Euro 2000, I thought it might be worthwhile in the cause of research to see how we interact with our European neighbours in a competitive context. Also, my new rule is that any event on which you can bet should be classified as a sport. I backed Holland - the only way a music lover can find Eurovision tolerable is to have a financial interest - and I still refuse to accept they were beaten by a Danish duo who looked like Kenny Rogers and his older brother, by a song from Ireland that included the lyric \"I made a candle in a dream I thought I heard\" and by a German entry entitled Wadde Hadde Duddle Da (I am not making this up).

Education was the most important policy for the nation's economic survival and social cohesion.

In a sense. Over the last three years of this parliament there will be record real terms growth in spending on state schools. But this follows two years of sticking to Conservative plans with only marginal adjustments upward. The result is that spending over the lifetime of Mr Blair's government will probably average a lower percentage of GDP than John Major's. This is not good enough.</p> <p>So the first commitment should be to repeat - and honour - that 1997 funding pledge. And it should be made clear that, in the next term, secondary schools, further education colleges and universities will get a fairer share of resources. Until now the rewards for improving quality have gone disproportionately to primary schools.</p> <p>If there is one promise people remember from the last election it is to \"cut class sizes to 30 or under for five, six and seven-year-olds by using money from the assisted places scheme\". Now that promise to reduce overcrowding should go further. The obvious place to start is a maximum class size of 30 for eight to 11-year-olds. It seems daft that classes of 30 seven-year-olds should reassemble into larger groups for their final years of primary school.</p> <p>So far ministers have resisted making a promise in this form. They think it would be expensive and impractical to build more classrooms in popular primaries on cramped sites. We need early figures from them so we can have a public debate. At least there should be a cast-iron commitment that every class over 30 has at least one fully-trained classroom assistant as well as the teacher. The aim is an adult-pupil ratio no worse than, say, 1:17.</p> <p>There should also be the offer of a free nursery place for every three-year-old whose parents want it, providing at least five half-days a week of pre-school education - as offered in Wales in 1999.</p> <p>For the same reason, ministers should resist the temptation to raise targets for 11-year-olds in national tests. It will be a great achievement if, as is likely, 80% reach the required standard by the summer of 2002. For the next phase, the goal should be to raise the performance of under-achieving primary schools and education authorities, rather than to reach a more ambitious national average.</p> <p>Parents express concern that David Blunkett's targets for under-11s cause stress and stand in the way of creativity. Fear of lost childhood is a backlash waiting to happen. If he feels naked without targets, let him concentrate on the wilderness years between 11 and 14.</p> <p>There is a more general point. A catchphrase of education policy in Labour's first term was \"intervention in inverse proportion to success\". It has not felt like that. If Labour ministers want us to believe they are succeeding, they should be promising to reduce their interventions, not increase them. That should mean less prescription from Whitehall, a less confrontational attitude from Ofsted, and more discretion for headteachers.</p> <p>The huge disparity of funding between schools must be addressed, but not by further emasculating local education authorities; if they work well, they can help their schools more appropriately than distant Whitehall. It is time to stop bashing them.</p> <p>Time too to concentrate on the morale of teachers. In time many will come to ac cept performance-related pay, but they are more concerned about their workload than their income. Administrative support on a large scale, proper photocopying facilities, free laptops and a properly-funded system of sabbaticals would ease the recruitment crisis.</p> <p>Even bigger money will be needed to repair buildings. In 1997 Labour estimated the cost was \u00a35bn-\u00a36bn and by the election the government will have tackled only about half the job. On the current expenditure side, there will be mileage in extending the popular Excellence in Cities programme to help stressed schools. No government will now suggest directing children to particular schools to tackle the problems of polarisation identified in the recent Guardian series by Nick Davies. But any government should provide the resources to alleviate or remedy acute social disadvantages that stand in the way of learning.</p> <p>Since league tables have become a fixation, let them measure how good schools are instead of reflecting the relative privilege of their intake. Pupil identification numbers will be needed to measure the progress of individuals through the system to show the value added at each stage. The system - with protection of civil liberties - should be put in place during the next parliament.</p> <p>And - as is usual for manifestos - that leaves too little space for further and higher education. A huge increase in students has contributed to a drastic reduction in money available for each one. Classes and tutorial groups have swelled in number and lecturers have an increased workload and a real-terms cut in income. This does not help deliver a quality service. Ministers must promise to implement the Bett report to improve pay at the top and bottom end of the university scale and eliminate gross gender discrimination. They must give similar attention to further education.</p> <p>With the sum of all this as the vision, Britain can look forward not only to a better educated population but a more prosperous, more civilised society. We should aim for nothing less.</p> <p><b> Do you think John Carvel has got it right - or is there more that should be done in the second term?

For the next phase, the goal should be to raise the performance of under-achieving primary schools and education authorities, rather than to reach a more ambitious national average. Parents express concern that David Blunkett's targets for under-11s cause stress and stand in the way of creativity. Fear of lost childhood is a backlash waiting to happen. If he feels naked without targets, let him concentrate on the wilderness years between 11 and 14. There is a more general point. A catchphrase of education policy in Labour's first term was \"intervention in inverse proportion to success\". It has not felt like that. If Labour ministers want us to believe they are succeeding, they should be promising to reduce their interventions, not increase them. That should mean less prescription from Whitehall, a less confrontational attitude from Ofsted, and more discretion for headteachers. The huge disparity of funding between schools must be addressed, but not by further emasculating local education authorities; if they work well, they can help their schools more appropriately than distant Whitehall. It is time to stop bashing them. Time too to concentrate on the morale of teachers. In time many will come to ac cept performance-related pay, but they are more concerned about their workload than their income. Administrative support on a large scale, proper photocopying facilities, free laptops and a properly-funded system of sabbaticals would ease the recruitment crisis. Even bigger money will be needed to repair buildings. In 1997 Labour estimated the cost was \u00a35bn-\u00a36bn and by the election the government will have tackled only about half the job. On the current expenditure side, there will be mileage in extending the popular Excellence in Cities programme to help stressed schools. No government will now suggest directing children to particular schools to tackle the problems of polarisation identified in the recent Guardian series by Nick Davies. But any government should provide the resources to alleviate or remedy acute social disadvantages that stand in the way of learning. Since league tables have become a fixation, let them measure how good schools are instead of reflecting the relative privilege of their intake. Pupil identification numbers will be needed to measure the progress of individuals through the system to show the value added at each stage. The system - with protection of civil liberties - should be put in place during the next parliament. And - as is usual for manifestos - that leaves too little space for further and higher education. A huge increase in students has contributed to a drastic reduction in money available for each one. Classes and tutorial groups have swelled in number and lecturers have an increased workload and a real-terms cut in income. This does not help deliver a quality service. Ministers must promise to implement the Bett report to improve pay at the top and bottom end of the university scale and eliminate gross gender discrimination. They must give similar attention to further education. With the sum of all this as the vision, Britain can look forward not only to a better educated population but a more prosperous, more civilised society. We should aim for nothing less. Do you think John Carvel has got it right - or is there more that should be done in the second term?

      "bodyText": "John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, is pressing for a huge investment in public housing by allocating an extra \u00a319bn over the next five years to renovate estates around the country. The Department of the Environment has told the chancellor, Gordon Brown, that unless more funds are put aside in the forthcoming comprehensive spending review, by 2010 tens of thousands of properties could be written off as beyond repair. Mr Prescott is linking his demand to the Treasury with a commitment to hive off most council houses to new social companies which, unlike local authorities, will be able to borrow on the open market, using projected income from rents as security for loans. In effect, the deputy prime minister is promising to extend his much-vaunted public-private partnership approach into social housing - although he totally rejects the view that this is an attempt to privatise council housing by the back door. Although 400,000 council houses, mainly from smaller authorities, have so far been hived off to housing associations and new companies, plans are now in hand for the biggest transfer so far. This financial year, councils are due to lose another 280,000 (including Birmingham's entire stock of 93,500 homes), provided tenants approve in a series of ballots. Mr Prescott's plan is given support today by Cambridge University's property research unit. In a report for the charity, Shelter, it argues that sufficient investment will only be forthcoming if councils hive off their housing stock. The report will be presented to the housing minister, Nick Raynsford, at a conference today.

      "bodyText": "Defences against rising seas caused by global warming could cost \u00a31.2 billion over the next 50 years, the government warned today. Following the publication of a government commissioned report warning that preventative measures could be far cheaper than the cost of doing nothing, the Environment minister Michael Meacher said the government recognised the importance of global warning. \"What we need to do is sensitise public opinion, business opinion and government opinion to ensure we make the maximum effort in this country to reduce emissions, to minimise the effects and adapt to those that are irreversible,\" he told a London news conference. \"That's the message.\" Mr Meacher warned that the cost of climate change would gradually mount and could reach the same budget levels as health or education spending. \"We are talking sizeable expenditure in which we have no choice because climate change is happening and we have to defend ourselves.\" The minister said work on adapting to climate change was at an early stage throughout the world but the UK was as far ahead as anywhere. The government has already taken action by requiring water companies to submit 25-year water resource plans that take climate change into account and incorporate estimates of sea level rise into guidance on project appraisal for sea defences. Other priority areas - building and infrastructure, habitats and species and planning, all most likely to be affected over the next 30-50 years - were identified by the report for the first time. On water, ways must be found to reduce demand, with more efficient domestic appliances, more meters, recycling and changes in behaviour. To deal with flooding there must be better flood defences and on building and infrastructure, new ways of designing. The electricity supply network should be able to withstand climate changes. In the regions, the vulnerable areas include the estuaries of the Mersey, Ribble and Arun. The low-lying Gwent levels, Somerset levels, Morecambe Bay, North Kent coastline and the ports of Heysham Harbour and Dover are also vulnerable. Transport links around the Dawlish and West Cumbrian coasts may be affected. Landscapes and wildlife could change forever in the Hampshire Downs, South Downs, New Forest, Welsh Uplands, the Lake District and Cairn Gorms. Flowers such as the Snowdon lily, and birds such as the dipper and snow bunting and arctic alpine species could disappear. But some species, including the kingfisher and nightingale and butterflies such as the Adonis blue, speckled wood and comma, could all prosper with the rise in temperatures.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Have you ever be on a routine journey somewhere and, as you've neared your destination, been seized by the sudden, devastating impulse to disown your life and just keep going? When Julie Holdcroft left her house two weeks ago, she had a definite purpose: to go to London Bridge and see-off friends participating in the Classic Rally Associations round the world rally. It was not an ambitious plan. She had a nine-year-old son, Tyler, at home in Bexhill, and a part time job as a hairdresser. She was not having a nervous breakdown. She was not wanted for murder. She was simply a woman enjoying a day out. </p> <p>At 10am, she stood on the bridge with 5,000 other spectators, cheering on a fleet of old cars as they prepared to embark on their 80-day odyssey. At the head of the rally stood a seven-and-a-half litre Rolls-Royce, a 1913 Silver Ghost given pole position for being the oldest car in the race. As the crowd clapped and whistled and the engines roared, it became apparent that something was wrong. The Rolls wouldn't budge; the cars behind it couldn't pass. As the air cooked with petrol fumes, a feeling of panic entered the atmosphere. In agitation, the car's driver appealed to the crowd for help. He was a crew member down and couldn't set off unless he replaced him. Julie Holdcroft, 40 years old, felt the irresistible tug of destiny. \"You have to do it, you have to grab it,\" she thought, and sailed out of the crowd towards the vehicle. Ten hours later, she was in France. </p> <p>Since returning from her adventure, Holdcroft has been compared to Shirley Valentine, the middle aged heroine of Willy Russell's film about a woman who goes on holiday and never returns. Holdcroft rejects the image. \"Somebody said, you're like Shirley Valentine and I thought, oh crumbs, I'm not trying to escape a boring life, I love my life!\" Her flight was a realisation of a common fantasy of taking a break from ourselves by doing something weird and irrational. \"I didn't surprise myself,\" says Holdcroft. \"I thought, if you're not hurting anyone, why not?\" </p> <p>Besides, when she jumped into the driver's seat, she only intended to go as far as Dover. She had no passport, no jacket, no provisions. It was a Monday morning and she had a week of perms and tints in front of her. In three weeks she would sit her final exams in art and design at college in Hastings. This was no time for taking off round the world with a man she had never met before. But the momentum of the adventure got into her bloodstream and she couldn't let it go. When she and her driver Terry Maxon, an American in his 60s, reached Dover, they sailed through passport control without a worry and it seemed to Julie Holdcroft that the only proper thing was to go on. </p> <p>Holdcroft is not by nature a cautious woman. She and her son live in a cottage two miles from the East Sussex coast. She has artistic flair, she says, and arty people are known for their impulsiveness. The day she left England, her son was staying with her ex-husband and one phone call ensured that he would be well looked after. She judged that the revision could wait, the dog could be fed by neighbours and all that stood in her way was the hairdressing. She was resolved not to sacrifice the dream for the sake of a few highlights. </p> <p>It was dark when she and Maxon arrived in Calais. The car was so noisy they had to yell at one another, and by Dover she hadn't made out Maxon's character. To Holdcroft's relief, it emerged in the quiet of the ferry that Maxon was as laid back as she was. \"I would have turned back if he'd been the sort of man to get uptight when we broke down,\" she says. \"And we did break down an awful lot.\" By the time they reached France, word had also gone round that a woman had joined the rally on impulse and Holdcroft was flooded with offers of clean knickers and woolly jumpers. News had even reached California, where friends had rung up Maxon's wife and demanded to know if she was aware that her husband was cavorting around Europe with a mystery blonde. \"She was amused rather than alarmed,\" says Holdcroft. </p> <p>Early on Tuesday morning, the car set off in the direction of the Alps. Outside Dijon, it started to slip behind the rest of the rally. Maxon and Holdcroft, caught up in the excitement of their own story, determined to catch up. Freezing, they drove the open topped car through the night, but were halted near the Italian border when they crashed into a Fiat. Holdcroft's limited knowledge of motor vehicles began to show. \"It took off the rear mud guard thing. It was the first accident Terry had had in his life, and he was very shaken. But when we'd got it sorted, he said, 'Hmm, we have a glamour wound now!' I thought that was a fantastic attitude.\" </p> <p>That night they pulled up at a cafe in the Italian Alps, where Terry handed out expensive cigars in return for help pushing the car. Holdcroft, meanwhile, was learning some new negotiating skills. \"I was trying to get hold of a flatbed truck to carry us to the next stage. There was a garage that couldn't give one out until eight in the morning, so I got hold of the rally office to ask what I should do. Terry was ready to get his whisky glasses out and camp down for the night, but we needed to catch up. The rally office suggested I offer them extra money. I had never tried to bribe anyone before, and when I did, they were deeply offended. It was a disaster. 'This is a very good man,' they kept saying, 'He cannot do it because he cannot do it. More money will not make it better.' \" </p> <p>On the third day, Maxon and Holdcroft faced a new danger: hairpin bends. The wheels on the Rolls Royce are made of wood, with narrow tyres. With the lights on, the car wouldn't run. They made a decision to divert from the official rally route over the mountains for a well-lit motorway, where something wonderful hap pened. As they struggled along, modern cars started escorting them, lights flashing, before and aft, waving and cheering them on from stage to stage. \"People were so kind and lovely. That was the best thing about it.\" </p> <p>They were heady with fatigue and excitement. At one stage, says Holdcroft, they drove past a gathering of \"tiny, toothless Italian women\" dressed in black at the roadside. \"Do you know who this is?\" Maxon yelled at them as they passed. \"This is the inspiration to all womankind!\" </p> <p>Somewhere in the middle of Greece, her phone rang. \"It was one of my customers, demanding to know why I wasn't at her house, doing her blow-dry.\" </p> <p>By the time they reached Thessaloniki the car was on its last legs and Holdcroft was becoming concerned that her son would be exposed to too much media attention. On Saturday she decided to fly home. Maxon pulled out of the race shortly afterwards because of irreparable mechanical failure. \"I never intended to go all the way round the world,\" she says. \"But I'd have liked to go a bit further. Hairdressing seems -\" she pauses, \"oh, maybe I shouldn't say, but it seems somehow small by comparison.\" </p> <p>Her reception in Bexhill has been loud and enthusiastic, except for a curt note from tutors reminding her that, when she has finished capering about the world, she has exams to concentrate on. Friends, meanwhile, have urged her to return to the rally if she wants to. But she doesn't. She has had her moment. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Have you ever be on a routine journey somewhere and, as you've neared your destination, been seized by the sudden, devastating impulse to disown your life and just keep going? When Julie Holdcroft left her house two weeks ago, she had a definite purpose: to go to London Bridge and see-off friends participating in the Classic Rally Associations round the world rally. It was not an ambitious plan. She had a nine-year-old son, Tyler, at home in Bexhill, and a part time job as a hairdresser. She was not having a nervous breakdown. She was not wanted for murder. She was simply a woman enjoying a day out. At 10am, she stood on the bridge with 5,000 other spectators, cheering on a fleet of old cars as they prepared to embark on their 80-day odyssey. At the head of the rally stood a seven-and-a-half litre Rolls-Royce, a 1913 Silver Ghost given pole position for being the oldest car in the race. As the crowd clapped and whistled and the engines roared, it became apparent that something was wrong. The Rolls wouldn't budge; the cars behind it couldn't pass. As the air cooked with petrol fumes, a feeling of panic entered the atmosphere. In agitation, the car's driver appealed to the crowd for help. He was a crew member down and couldn't set off unless he replaced him. Julie Holdcroft, 40 years old, felt the irresistible tug of destiny. \"You have to do it, you have to grab it,\" she thought, and sailed out of the crowd towards the vehicle. Ten hours later, she was in France. Since returning from her adventure, Holdcroft has been compared to Shirley Valentine, the middle aged heroine of Willy Russell's film about a woman who goes on holiday and never returns. Holdcroft rejects the image. \"Somebody said, you're like Shirley Valentine and I thought, oh crumbs, I'm not trying to escape a boring life, I love my life!\" Her flight was a realisation of a common fantasy of taking a break from ourselves by doing something weird and irrational. \"I didn't surprise myself,\" says Holdcroft. \"I thought, if you're not hurting anyone, why not?\" Besides, when she jumped into the driver's seat, she only intended to go as far as Dover. She had no passport, no jacket, no provisions. It was a Monday morning and she had a week of perms and tints in front of her. In three weeks she would sit her final exams in art and design at college in Hastings. This was no time for taking off round the world with a man she had never met before. But the momentum of the adventure got into her bloodstream and she couldn't let it go. When she and her driver Terry Maxon, an American in his 60s, reached Dover, they sailed through passport control without a worry and it seemed to Julie Holdcroft that the only proper thing was to go on. Holdcroft is not by nature a cautious woman. She and her son live in a cottage two miles from the East Sussex coast. She has artistic flair, she says, and arty people are known for their impulsiveness. The day she left England, her son was staying with her ex-husband and one phone call ensured that he would be well looked after. She judged that the revision could wait, the dog could be fed by neighbours and all that stood in her way was the hairdressing. She was resolved not to sacrifice the dream for the sake of a few highlights. It was dark when she and Maxon arrived in Calais. The car was so noisy they had to yell at one another, and by Dover she hadn't made out Maxon's character. To Holdcroft's relief, it emerged in the quiet of the ferry that Maxon was as laid back as she was. \"I would have turned back if he'd been the sort of man to get uptight when we broke down,\" she says. \"And we did break down an awful lot.\" By the time they reached France, word had also gone round that a woman had joined the rally on impulse and Holdcroft was flooded with offers of clean knickers and woolly jumpers. News had even reached California, where friends had rung up Maxon's wife and demanded to know if she was aware that her husband was cavorting around Europe with a mystery blonde. \"She was amused rather than alarmed,\" says Holdcroft. Early on Tuesday morning, the car set off in the direction of the Alps. Outside Dijon, it started to slip behind the rest of the rally. Maxon and Holdcroft, caught up in the excitement of their own story, determined to catch up. Freezing, they drove the open topped car through the night, but were halted near the Italian border when they crashed into a Fiat. Holdcroft's limited knowledge of motor vehicles began to show. \"It took off the rear mud guard thing. It was the first accident Terry had had in his life, and he was very shaken. But when we'd got it sorted, he said, 'Hmm, we have a glamour wound now!' I thought that was a fantastic attitude.\" That night they pulled up at a cafe in the Italian Alps, where Terry handed out expensive cigars in return for help pushing the car. Holdcroft, meanwhile, was learning some new negotiating skills. \"I was trying to get hold of a flatbed truck to carry us to the next stage. There was a garage that couldn't give one out until eight in the morning, so I got hold of the rally office to ask what I should do. Terry was ready to get his whisky glasses out and camp down for the night, but we needed to catch up. The rally office suggested I offer them extra money. I had never tried to bribe anyone before, and when I did, they were deeply offended. It was a disaster. 'This is a very good man,' they kept saying, 'He cannot do it because he cannot do it. More money will not make it better.' \" On the third day, Maxon and Holdcroft faced a new danger: hairpin bends. The wheels on the Rolls Royce are made of wood, with narrow tyres. With the lights on, the car wouldn't run. They made a decision to divert from the official rally route over the mountains for a well-lit motorway, where something wonderful hap pened. As they struggled along, modern cars started escorting them, lights flashing, before and aft, waving and cheering them on from stage to stage. \"People were so kind and lovely. That was the best thing about it.\" They were heady with fatigue and excitement. At one stage, says Holdcroft, they drove past a gathering of \"tiny, toothless Italian women\" dressed in black at the roadside. \"Do you know who this is?\" Maxon yelled at them as they passed. \"This is the inspiration to all womankind!\" Somewhere in the middle of Greece, her phone rang. \"It was one of my customers, demanding to know why I wasn't at her house, doing her blow-dry.\" By the time they reached Thessaloniki the car was on its last legs and Holdcroft was becoming concerned that her son would be exposed to too much media attention. On Saturday she decided to fly home. Maxon pulled out of the race shortly afterwards because of irreparable mechanical failure. \"I never intended to go all the way round the world,\" she says. \"But I'd have liked to go a bit further. Hairdressing seems -\" she pauses, \"oh, maybe I shouldn't say, but it seems somehow small by comparison.\" Her reception in Bexhill has been loud and enthusiastic, except for a curt note from tutors reminding her that, when she has finished capering about the world, she has exams to concentrate on. Friends, meanwhile, have urged her to return to the rally if she wants to. But she doesn't. She has had her moment.",

      "body": "<p> <b>afouche:</b> Have you found that your memories of that night affect your day to day life? </p> <p> <b>Duwayne Brooks:</b> Dear afouche, the incident on April 22 has now passed me, but I've not forgotten. This is what inspires me to continue to be firm when everybody is out to get me. </p> <br> <p> <b>afouche:</b> Have you developed a prejudice as a result towards white people? </p> <p> <b>DB:</b> As regards to prejudice against white people I have respect for everybody regardless of colour, creed or religion. We are all of one blood, no matter what anyone wants to say. A lot of people have suggested that I may have a thing against white people. May I just say now to get the record straight my solicitor is white, many important friends are white, and if I never trusted white people these people would not be in my life. </p> <br> <p> <b>jonifame:</b> I was shocked and angered by the story of how the police are treating you. If stop and search and police harassment are normal for young black men in London, and you say things aren't getting better through the government, do you think there could end up being riots etc again? </p> <p> <b>DB:</b> Hello Jonifame. If the government allows the police to continue on this downward trend, breaking all ties with ethnic minorities, the only result will be to alienate themselves and create total anarchy. </p> <br> <p> <b>Gwladys28:</b> Have you faced any kind of police harassment since the collapse of the case last week? </p> <p> <b>DB:</b> Dear Gwladys28, how d'you pronounce your name? Well, in the last two weeks, I've been stopped once outside the premises I was staying at while I was on bail. Since the case was thrown out of court, there has been a major incident outside my bail address. The police instigated hourly patrols for our protection. Ironically, Duwayne Brooks, who the police were supposed to be protecting, was the first person to be stopped and questioned. Is this harassment or just the police doing their job? What d'you think? </p> <br> <p> <b>Morcheeba:</b> What did you think of the Macpherson report? Do you think there is any real will on the part of the government to shake up the police and justice system, or is it all going to get forgotten? </p> <p> <b>DB:</b> Hello Morcheeba. I think the Macpherson report was a good thing at the beginning. Since then I've had grave reservations on what its real purpose is. Is it really a watershed for race relations or does it just give the police reason to blame more black people for the increase in street crime? Or to stop us when we are going about our daily business? If change was really supposed to happen why have no officers been disciplined, and why have there not been any changes in the way police deal with ethnic minorities during their everyday duties. The inquiry only touched on the surface of how deeply, institutionally racist public bodies like the police are. </p> <br> <p> <b>whit73:</b> In your opinion, how do you feel the British police can ever genuinely reform itself to become less institutionally racist? </p> <p> <b>DB:</b> Hello, Whit73. While police investigate police there is no hope for the police to change. We as taxpayers pay their wages so we should be entitled to discipline and regulate them when they step out of line. Until this happens, we will be stopped and searched unnecessarily, maliciously prosecuted and, worst of all, there will still be unaccountable deaths in police custody. </p> <p> <br> </p> <p> <b>bat0181:</b> What do you think of John Grieve, head of the Met's new race crimes unit? </p> <p> <b>DB:</b> Hello, Bat. I think John Grieve is the best talker in the Met, and that's why he is where he is. I have met Mr Grieve on a number of occasions and all he does is talk, talk, talk. I have yet to see any action on anything he has said to me over the past 12 months. I appreciate his work on the Menson case, but why has there been no investigation into the failure of the police to treat this as a serious murder case? </p> <br> <p> <b>H Mayor:</b> Have you experienced first hand the kind of intimidating prejudice which was demonstrated by the hidden cameras in the homes of those implicated in this crime? </p> <p> <b>DB:</b> In my everyday life as a service engineer, spending 95% of my time in offices owned by white people I never get that sort of direct abusive racism. What you do get is a form of indirect racism which could be down to the background of the person or just pure ignorance. </p> <br> <p> <b>JSwan:</b> How do you think we can promote greater racial tolerance and understanding? </p> <p> <b>DB:</b> Hello JSwan. First of all, better education during our teenage years. I remember when I was in primary school I didn't know anything about racism. We were all friends in our class, black, white and Chinese. I first experienced racism in secondary school. This is where the education needs to start, when we are at an age to understand other people's cultures, needs and religions. When we can understand fully all these things, then and only then will we be able to live together in unity. </p> <br> <p> <b>Meatloaf:</b> Duwayne, what are your impressions of the coverage Stephen's case received in the media, particularly post-Macpherson? After the accusations of institutional racism, the papers launched a defence of the police - which happened to coincide with lots of talk of Yardies - some of the most racist stuff there has been in the media for some time. </p> <p> <b>DB:</b> Hello, Meatloaf. Well we know the police have friends in high editorial places. For instance, when I was arrested and charged with attempted rape it appeared in the Sun newspaper the next day, despite the fact that I wasn't charged till after midnight. Then when they dropped the attempted rape charge, who bothered to report that? Regardless of whether the people are black or white, whenever the police are on the backfoot they always produce stories in the press to justify their actions, or to draw attention away from bad news. I thought it was strange that the same day my case was dropped the police announced new arrests in the Lawrence case. </p> <br> <p> <b>Bat0181:</b> Duwayne, you've recently decided to tell the public your side of the story via the media (eg the Guardian interview, this online chat thing). I was wondering what prompted this decision on your part - how did you weigh up the risks of further hassle against the benefits of setting the record straight? </p> <p> <b>DB:</b> Dear Bat0181, I had hoped other people in higher positions than me would have foresaken political careers and financial gain and highlighted the problems that young black men have. </p> <br> <p> <b>DB:</b> Thank you everyone for posting your messages. Let's hope the Guardian ain't using us just to boost newspaper sales. I hope to be back here soon. If you want to email me send messages on to simon.hattenstone@theguardian.com and he will pass them on. (I hope) </p>",

      "bodyText": "afouche: Have you found that your memories of that night affect your day to day life? Duwayne Brooks: Dear afouche, the incident on April 22 has now passed me, but I've not forgotten. This is what inspires me to continue to be firm when everybody is out to get me. afouche: Have you developed a prejudice as a result towards white people? DB: As regards to prejudice against white people I have respect for everybody regardless of colour, creed or religion. We are all of one blood, no matter what anyone wants to say. A lot of people have suggested that I may have a thing against white people. May I just say now to get the record straight my solicitor is white, many important friends are white, and if I never trusted white people these people would not be in my life. jonifame: I was shocked and angered by the story of how the police are treating you. If stop and search and police harassment are normal for young black men in London, and you say things aren't getting better through the government, do you think there could end up being riots etc again? DB: Hello Jonifame. If the government allows the police to continue on this downward trend, breaking all ties with ethnic minorities, the only result will be to alienate themselves and create total anarchy. Gwladys28: Have you faced any kind of police harassment since the collapse of the case last week? DB: Dear Gwladys28, how d'you pronounce your name? Well, in the last two weeks, I've been stopped once outside the premises I was staying at while I was on bail. Since the case was thrown out of court, there has been a major incident outside my bail address. The police instigated hourly patrols for our protection. Ironically, Duwayne Brooks, who the police were supposed to be protecting, was the first person to be stopped and questioned. Is this harassment or just the police doing their job? What d'you think? Morcheeba: What did you think of the Macpherson report? Do you think there is any real will on the part of the government to shake up the police and justice system, or is it all going to get forgotten? DB: Hello Morcheeba. I think the Macpherson report was a good thing at the beginning. Since then I've had grave reservations on what its real purpose is. Is it really a watershed for race relations or does it just give the police reason to blame more black people for the increase in street crime? Or to stop us when we are going about our daily business? If change was really supposed to happen why have no officers been disciplined, and why have there not been any changes in the way police deal with ethnic minorities during their everyday duties. The inquiry only touched on the surface of how deeply, institutionally racist public bodies like the police are. whit73: In your opinion, how do you feel the British police can ever genuinely reform itself to become less institutionally racist? DB: Hello, Whit73. While police investigate police there is no hope for the police to change. We as taxpayers pay their wages so we should be entitled to discipline and regulate them when they step out of line. Until this happens, we will be stopped and searched unnecessarily, maliciously prosecuted and, worst of all, there will still be unaccountable deaths in police custody. bat0181: What do you think of John Grieve, head of the Met's new race crimes unit? DB: Hello, Bat. I think John Grieve is the best talker in the Met, and that's why he is where he is. I have met Mr Grieve on a number of occasions and all he does is talk, talk, talk. I have yet to see any action on anything he has said to me over the past 12 months. I appreciate his work on the Menson case, but why has there been no investigation into the failure of the police to treat this as a serious murder case? H Mayor: Have you experienced first hand the kind of intimidating prejudice which was demonstrated by the hidden cameras in the homes of those implicated in this crime? DB: In my everyday life as a service engineer, spending 95% of my time in offices owned by white people I never get that sort of direct abusive racism. What you do get is a form of indirect racism which could be down to the background of the person or just pure ignorance. JSwan: How do you think we can promote greater racial tolerance and understanding? DB: Hello JSwan. First of all, better education during our teenage years. I remember when I was in primary school I didn't know anything about racism. We were all friends in our class, black, white and Chinese. I first experienced racism in secondary school. This is where the education needs to start, when we are at an age to understand other people's cultures, needs and religions. When we can understand fully all these things, then and only then will we be able to live together in unity. Meatloaf: Duwayne, what are your impressions of the coverage Stephen's case received in the media, particularly post-Macpherson? After the accusations of institutional racism, the papers launched a defence of the police - which happened to coincide with lots of talk of Yardies - some of the most racist stuff there has been in the media for some time. DB: Hello, Meatloaf. Well we know the police have friends in high editorial places. For instance, when I was arrested and charged with attempted rape it appeared in the Sun newspaper the next day, despite the fact that I wasn't charged till after midnight. Then when they dropped the attempted rape charge, who bothered to report that? Regardless of whether the people are black or white, whenever the police are on the backfoot they always produce stories in the press to justify their actions, or to draw attention away from bad news. I thought it was strange that the same day my case was dropped the police announced new arrests in the Lawrence case. Bat0181: Duwayne, you've recently decided to tell the public your side of the story via the media (eg the Guardian interview, this online chat thing). I was wondering what prompted this decision on your part - how did you weigh up the risks of further hassle against the benefits of setting the record straight? DB: Dear Bat0181, I had hoped other people in higher positions than me would have foresaken political careers and financial gain and highlighted the problems that young black men have. DB: Thank you everyone for posting your messages. Let's hope the Guardian ain't using us just to boost newspaper sales. I hope to be back here soon. If you want to email me send messages on to simon.hattenstone@theguardian.com and he will pass them on. (I hope)",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\"You lot may just as well be on a different planet,\" said a senior television executive to a newspaper journalist the day after Piers Morgan was censured by the press complaints commission. \"Press self-regulation is just a joke.\" </p> <p>It's not difficult to appreciate his point. When Carlton television was found guilty of faking a documentary on the drugs trade, the company was fined \u00a32m by the independent television commission. When the press complaints commission (PCC) decided that the Mirror was guilty of a serious breach of its code of conduct, and Morgan as editor was personally responsible, all it could do was state plaintively: \"In view of the unsatisfactory state of affairs revealed by this episode, the commission decided formally to register its concern about the general application of the code in this area with the management of Trinity Mirror.\" Different planets indeed. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Thursday's judgment against Morgan was a defining moment in the recent history of newspaper regulation. It was only the second time that the PCC had found against the editor of a national newspaper (Morgan being the subject of the first censure as well), and the language used was clear and direct: \"The editor's conduct in this case... had fallen short of the high professional standards demanded by the code.\" Lord Wakeham, the chairman of the PCC, declared there had been a \"climate of slack, it was all gay abandon\". And Morgan himself is understood to have felt particularly chastised - splashing the entire PCC judgment across two pages of his own newspaper took self-flagellation to a new extreme. </p> <p>So why is it, then, that there is a gnawing feeling of dissatisfaction, a feeling that somehow what the PCC said was not quite strong enough, that Morgan has got away with a slap on the wrist, that there is something unsatisfactory about the whole business of self-regulation? </p> <p>Back to our television executive. He just can not get his head round the fact that the editor of the second biggest-selling national daily paper could get away with profiting from shares in companies whose stock market value was directly influenced by what his columnists wrote - and not only that, he still survives a stinging criticism from the organisation that regulates his industry. This particular executive, a BBC man, pointed to the piles of ring-binder files labelled \"producer guidelines\" which govern what he can and can not get away with. They are an imposing sight - especially when you consider that you can fit the PCC code on the back of a large envelope. </p> <p>So why should readers, government and the industry itself be satisfied by what we have got? Roger Alton, the editor of the Observer, says that the PCC is far from a toothless tiger. Its rulings are feared by editors and journalists alike, and every effort is made to comply with the (albeit brief) code. \"To underestimate what journalists and editors feel about what the PCC says is a great mistake. I get a lot of stuff from the PCC, investigating complaints, after almost all of which we are exonerated. But we spend a lot of time working on each one, speaking to the journalists, writing letters, compiling documents. We don't want to lose a PCC adjudication. It is a very important thing.\" </p> <p>David Yelland, the editor of the Sun, and Morgan's main rival, agrees that an adverse PCC judgment is an editor's nightmare. \"If you are on the end of one, it is a painful experience. I was very uncomfortable when Lord Wakeham was on the steps reading the Sophie [Rhys Jones] ruling. I can't imagine what Piers must be feeling.\" </p> <p>Alton believes that the PCC decision is a sobering moment for the newspaper industry as a whole: \"The nature of this ruling is astounding. It will make newspaper editors redouble their efforts not to cross the PCC.\" Clearly, the board of Trinity Mirror feels the same way. The statement issued after Thursday's ruling was measured and contrite, expressing \"regret\" that Morgan had breached the code. </p> <p>Yelland makes a clear distinction between the conduct of Morgan and the implications of the PCC ruling. The actions of Morgan were unforgivable, and he is lucky to have survived, he says. \"It has been a terrible week for newspapers. We have all been harmed by this, because the public doesn't necessarily realise that this was only going on among a small group of people at the Mirror. We have all made mistakes - I made mistakes over the Sophie pictures which didn't help the business - but this is far more serious.\" </p> <p>And while newspapers themselves have suffered, the affair has been a disaster for the Mirror, he says. \"It has been a bloody awful week for the Mirror. They can never question fat cats again. They are so weakened, and I think they didn't realise how serious a situation they got themselves into until the PCC published its judgment on Thursday.\" </p> <p>If the Mirror handled the situation badly, the PCC under Lord Wakeham once again rode to the rescue of self-regulation. Since the former Thatcher confidant took over at the commission in 1995, replacing Lord McGregor of Durris, he has transformed the organisation into a highly sophisticated political animal. He has said the things that politicians and the public want to hear, when they want to hear it. His pronouncements over coverage of the young members of the royal family struck a chord, and his ruling against Yelland on the publication of topless pictures of Sophie Rhys Jones were also in tune with the public mood. </p> <p>Yelland says: \"The job that Lord Wakeham and director Guy Black have done at the PCC is one of the greatest achievements of the last few years. Their most important achievement has been to create a level playing field.\" So when paparazzi photos of Prince William snogging a young beauty land on the picture desk, tabloid editors can turn them down safe in the knowledge that rivals will do the same. \"The commercial pressure has been lifted,\" Yelland says. </p> <p>Alton says that the PCC has to work, because the alternative - a legal framework imposing tough privacy laws - would place damaging restrictions on a press that already has to battle against a panoply of restrictive legislation. \"There was clearly a problem. They were using Mirror readers to ramp up the share price, and that was wrong. But I do think we should defend the PCC. The alternatives are just too horrible to contemplate.\" </p> <p>So why are newspapers so determined to be seen to take the PCC seriously? For a start, says Peter Cole, former editor of the Sunday Correspondent and now professor of journalism at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, they are all signed up to it. They can hardly break away when it doesn't suit them. \"There is to a certain extent a sort of tacit conspiracy between the editors and the PCC. The PCC knows it is only there because things had come to such a pass before. The creation of the PCC was a strategic avoidance by the newspaper industry of privacy legislation at the point it came into being. It is in the interests of both parties to be seen to be taking it seriously. </p> <p>\"The PCC has always been seen to be the lesser of two evils. Some editors firmly believe in it, but there are others - and they probably tend to be at the tabloid end of the market - who support it through gritted teeth. The price of that is that if it is the editor who is the subject of a judgment, he or she has to go along with it.\" Cole agrees with Yelland's analysis of the present chairman's tenure. \"Lord Wakeham has a strong sense of political sophistication. His political antennae are as sharp as they were when he served Thatcher.\" </p> <p>That, of course, is all very well, says our television executive. But Morgan has still got his job, despite having clocked up two PCC judgments against him. The received wisdom is that Morgan is a strong editor who has turned an ailing newspaper into a proper tabloid again, with a fiery mix of showbiz nonsense and hard news. \"I think he is a fantastic editor, tremendous. I think he has done a wonderful job,\" says Alton. Cole agrees: \"If a proprietor had wanted to fire him, this PCC ruling would have been manna from heaven.\" </p> <p>But Peter Oborne, the Express commentator, who is close to the Trinity Mirror chairman Victor Blank, says it is inconceivable that Morgan should remain as editor, after he \"tolerated and even fostered a culture of greed and corruption\". No matter that Morgan is good at his job, he says. By not sacking Morgan, Blank - a man of honour in his other business dealings - has applied \"one set of standards for his own business and another for the great newspaper group he has the honour to chair\", he wrote on Friday. The survival of Morgan has weakened that great group. \"And he has perpetuated the shameful notion that there is one set of standards for newspapers and newspaper journalists, and another for everybody else.\" </p> <p>In a strong pay-off, he concluded: \"Damn you, Victor Blank. By failing to sack Morgan you have brought disgrace on a great and honourable calling.\" </p> <p>The words will have thundered around Canary Wharf. They are a telling indictment, from an analyst who has no particular axe to grind, of the conduct of Trinity Mirror. Add to that the growing unease about Blank's handling of the situation among the City pundits of the financial pages, and Morgan's situation suddenly looks far shakier. \"Blank will go before Piers will go,\" says Yelland, \"because he is an honourable man. When people like Peter Oborne and the Telegraph financial page commentators are starting to criticise Mirror Group's reputation, I can't tell you how bad that is.\" </p> <p><strong> Press excesses: a decade of last chances</strong></p> <p>1989: Calcutt inquiry set up by Thatcher government after such tabloid outrages as the Sun's blaming of Liverpool fans for Hillsborough. Home Office minister David Mellor says the press is \"drinking in the Last Chance Saloon\". </p> <p> 1990: Calcutt recommendations fall short of expected statutory regulation and/or privacy law. Backs replacement of Press Council by press complaints commission (PCC) as the \"last chance\" for self-regulation, with tribunal headed by judge to take over if system breaks down. Also proposes introduction of new criminal offences of physical intrusion, but government decides not to implement. </p> <p> 1991: PCC starts work with Lord McGregor as chair. Commission mixes tabloid and broadsheet editors (\"The pops all regard us as middle-class wankers,\" says Telegraph editor Max Hastings. \"We sit there thinking, 'What are we doing with all these animals?'\"). In first year it upholds complaints against News of the World from Clare Short and against People over nude photo of Princess Eugenie. Praises press for cleaning up its act, and threat of statutory regulation recedes. </p> <p> 1992: General election passes without tabloid misconduct. But fallout from Andrew Morton's Diana biography revives hand-wringing over privacy, with McGregor, unaware that Diana was involved in book and that Palace gave misleading briefings, attacking \"odious\" royal stories for \"dabbling their fingers in the stuff of other people's souls\". Press back in Last Chance Saloon as - 10 days before the People discloses his affair with Antonia de Sancha - Mellor recalls Calcutt to review self-regulation. </p> <p> 1993: Calcutt II criticises PCC and backs statutory tribunal and code of practice, and new tort of infringement of privacy. Government warns PCC to get its act together, or regulation will be imposed. PCC tightens code. Transcript of Camillagate tape and Diana gym photos cause controversy, with Mirror Group briefly quitting PCC over rap for latter. </p> <p> 1994: Government white paper on privacy law expected but postponed. PCC censures photos of Edward kissing Sophie, clears Sun day Times of entrapment in cash-for-questions row. Lord Wakeham chosen as McGregor's replacement. </p> <p> 1995: Watered-down white paper rejects statutory regulation, proposes tighter code, and says no consensus for civil privacy law. News of the World's Piers Morgan spanked over report on Earl Spencer's wife. Wakeham warns press not to harass Prince William. </p> <p> 1996: Wakeham agrees that \"toothless watchdog\" now has teeth. Rules on public interest defence of intrusion tightened. Tabloids caned for anti-German headlines during Euro 96. Gerald Kaufman calls Wakeham \"a eunuch trying to do the best in the circumstances\". </p> <p> 1997: Death of Diana causes outcry over paparazzi. Editors agree to tighten privacy code, some vow to ban paparazzi photos. Government plans to incorporate European convention on human rights into UK law; Wakeham condemns as erosion of freedom of press. </p> <p> 1998: Debate continues over prospect of \"back-door privacy law\" via judges using Lord Irvine's Human Rights Bill. Stories involving private lives of Robin Cook, Nick Brown, Peter Mandelson and Jack Straw's son prove embarrassing in this context. </p> <p> 1999: Blairs protest successfully over story about daughter's school and photo of son. PCC raps Sun over the topless Sophie photo, and criticises News of the World \"conviction bonus\" to Gary Glitter trial witness. </p> <p> 2000: Piers Morgan receives another PCC six-of-the-best over Mirror's City Slickers column and share dealings.</p>",

Gerald Kaufman calls Wakeham \"a eunuch trying to do the best in the circumstances\". 1997: Death of Diana causes outcry over paparazzi. Editors agree to tighten privacy code, some vow to ban paparazzi photos. Government plans to incorporate European convention on human rights into UK law; Wakeham condemns as erosion of freedom of press. 1998: Debate continues over prospect of \"back-door privacy law\" via judges using Lord Irvine's Human Rights Bill. Stories involving private lives of Robin Cook, Nick Brown, Peter Mandelson and Jack Straw's son prove embarrassing in this context. 1999: Blairs protest successfully over story about daughter's school and photo of son. PCC raps Sun over the topless Sophie photo, and criticises News of the World \"conviction bonus\" to Gary Glitter trial witness. 2000: Piers Morgan receives another PCC six-of-the-best over Mirror's City Slickers column and share dealings.",

After all, the papers published quite separate reasons for their decisions to abandon the Labour candidate, Frank Dobson. But politicians and journalists dislike coincidences.

The reporters picked up hints that there had been a discussion about private polling data which evidently showed Livingstone might be more vulnerable than other surveys had shown. They also obtained quotes from those most talkative, and reliable, of people known as \"anonymous sources\" in both Livingstone's and Dobson's camps. The jigsaw of their theory was fitting together nicely . </p> <p>Campbell and Gould had betrayed their candidate, and their party, in order to stop Livingstone. They had their story and it duly appeared, taking up a full page in the first edition of last weekend's Sunday Telegraph. Purporting to tell \"the inside story\", the main headline read: \"The day Labour backed Norris\" and a secondary line asked rhetorically: \"Was there a desperate Downing Street plot to stop Livingstone at any cost?\" </p> <p>It was laced with the kind of innuendo that placed Campbell and Gould at the heart of the conspiracy. Yet neither man was called before publication for their views on the story. The first Campbell heard about it was in a phone call at a north London party at 9pm on Saturday. After reading a faxed copy of the article, he immediately called the Sunday Telegraph and spoke to news editor Chris Boffey to make a vehement protest. </p> <p>It was, he said, completely untrue and quite obviously libellous. He hadn't had to go very far for legal advice. His beloved football team, Burnley, had won promotion and the barrister brother of his partner, Fiona Millar, was celebrating winning his silk. The place was also full of lawyers. </p> <p>Boffey, who has known Campbell for years, moved swiftly. With editor Dominic Lawson away, and acting editor Matthew d'Ancona having left for the evening, he rewrote passages in the article to take account of Campbell's complaint. But the story was so flawed, starting from a false premise and built up with a series of inaccuracies, that the remedial action wasn't enough to assuage Campbell's and Gould's understandable anger. </p> <p>They knew that the story had been presented in a plausible fashion, with all sorts of details and quotes, so that most readers would have thought it true. It was written in such a way that it had the ring of veracity and was hedged by a get-out clause: \"It is impossible to prove that No 10 brought any influence to bear on the two newspapers.\" These weasel words did nothing to mitigate the damage. So Campbell and Gould demanded an apology, which appeared in yesterday's Sunday Telegraph. The paper will pay a sum of money to charity. </p> <p>It accepted that the article was \"without foundation\" and regretted that Campbell and Gould were not given an opportunity to respond to the allegations before publication. Boffey told me: \"We admit we made a mistake. We rectified it as soon as we possibly could, probably within 15 minutes of Mr Campbell's call.\" </p> <p>But my understanding is that, initially, Murphy stood by his story, claiming that his report was true. Reporters are always defensive when they make mistakes, and Murphy is generally regarded as having a good track record, but his refusal to back down shows how difficult it is for people to persuade even rational journalists to apologise. </p> <p>It is known that Boffey and Lawson are very upset at what happened. One of their senior executives said: \"They can't believe it happened. It's been a shock to their system. What should have been a subtle piece about the circumstances behind Livingstone's election turned into something completely different.\" </p> <p>Indeed, the Sunday Telegraph's relationship with Downing Street has been quite warm in the past three years, much warmer than that of most other Sunday titles. It is known that Campbell and the rest of his press team have grown used to issuing a string of denials every Saturday night because of false stories in Sunday papers. A couple of weeks ago, of the first seven stories on a Sky TV news bulletin, five were effectively denials of articles running on the front pages of Sunday papers. Campbell has evidently grown so frustrated by such stories that he often lets them pass without comment. But he could see that the implications of the Sunday Telegraph story were so serious he had to take action. </p> <p>It is only the second time he has demanded an apology. The other occasion was when the Daily Mail suggested his father had died when Campbell was a child. In fact, his father is still alive. </p> <p>Campbell is not the only Blair aide who suffered at the hands of last weekend's papers. Jonathan Powell, Blair's chief of staff, was also accused of spin-doctoring. He has demanded an apology from the Mail on Sunday following an article by Julia Langdon in which she accused him of briefing against Dobson and Mo Mowlam. </p> <p>According to the piece, he has been, \"fingered as the man who poisons the well\". But there appeared to be scant evidence for the allegation. No specific instances were detailed to support the assertion. It is known - naturally enough, by journalists - that the famously discreet Powell doesn't talk to journalists. So which reporters on which papers did Powell brief? The Mail on Sunday offered no clues. </p> <p>Once again, we are confronted by the problem of writers being able to point to anonymous sources which, by tradition, they do not need to identify.

      "body": "<p>The awards are for outstanding, original, investigative reporting, but they are the prizes that no journalist really wants to win. They are the Project Censored annual awards for the best stories that never made the impact they deserved, and this year they are seen, in particular, as a warning sign of the effects of the increase in global, multi-media ownership. </p> <p>Started 25 years ago and based in the sociology department at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona, Project Censored scans specialist journals, alternative weeklies, fringe publications, political magazines and the trade and medical press for stories that its team feels should have have received an airing in the mainstream press. </p> <p>The first of the criteria for entry is that the story contains \"information that the general US population has a right and need to know, but to which it has had limited access\". The team, consisting of academics, media commentators and students, scans several thousand stories and produces a shortlist of around 200 which are then submitted to a judging panel. </p> <p>The panel of around 20 judges this year included historian Howard Zinn, author Richard Barnet, journalist and author Susan Faludi and professors of journalism or communications from US universities. They chose the \"top 25 censored stories\" which are published this month in book format. Although the stories are not censored in the usual sense, the theme of the awards is that ignoring such stories amounts to a form of self-censorship by the major media outlets. </p> <p>This year's collection contains a wide spread of stories, from an attack on the American Cancer Society in the International Journal of Health Services, to an article from Mother Jones magazine on the \"unstable personnel\" controlling US nuclear weapons; from the San Francisco Bay Guardian's report on the treatment of juvenile offenders to the Turkish government's destruction of Kurdish villages with US weapons, published in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. Five of the top 25 stories concern the US's role in Kosovo and elsewhere in the Balkans last year. </p> <p>\"It used to be just a list,\" says project co-ordinator Tricia Boreta of the awards. It has gradually expanded and the publication of the winners is now incorporated in a 350-page review of American journalism and watched with interest by those in the media. \"The stories [that win] have become much more international in breadth.\" </p> <p>Peter Phillips, the current director of the project, which involves 175 people in the monitoring and selection of the stories, says he was taught that a common mistake in English is to use the word \"media\" as a singular rather than a plural, but that increasingly \"I find myself wondering if media isn't singular after all . . . it is singular in its methods of story editing and selection, focusing on entertainment value instead of newsworthiness.\" Phillips believes that the growth of media mergers means there is an increasing homogeneity in news coverage. </p> <p>Even when events are given a large amount of coverage, Phillips suggests, the focus may often be unhelpful: \"The entire corporate media coverage of the World Trade Organisation protests left most Americans wondering what the fuss was about, as the media focused on the minor vandalism and ignored the global socio-economic issues that drove 60,000 protesters to Seattle.\" </p> <p>Certainly, many US journalists complain about what they see as a narrow focus of news in which one story, such as that concerning the Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, is dwelt on to the exclusion of others. But there is also concern about the growing tendency of media interests to merge, often creating regional monopolies. It is an issue addressed by commentator William Safire in the New York Times recently in connection with the dispute between Time Warner and ABC-Disney, which led to the former blacking out the programmes provided by the latter in a dispute over cable payments. </p> <p>\"The news has become a casualty of warring entertainment and information empires,\" wrote Safire, \"and the conflict has escalated from one locality to the globe . . . Concentration of power over what we see in the news - and even if we see a competitor's news - is a danger to democracy.\" </p> <p>One theme of this year's awards has been foreign coverage - or the lack of it. Number seven of the award winners is an article by veteran war reporter Peter Arnett in the American Journalism Review, in which he cites the sharp decrease in foreign coverage. \"Today, a foreign story that doesn't involve bombs, natural disaster or financial calamity has little chance of entering the American consciousness,\" he writes. \"Television news in the heyday of Walter Cronkite, John Chancellor and Frank Reynolds contained at least 40% international coverage. The figure today is 7-12% and dropping.\" </p> <p>Arnett concludes that the country's newspapers, magazines and TV stations \"seeking greater profits through larger audiences, fed the public a diet of crime news, celebrity gossip and soft features, choosing to exclude more serious topics that news managers feared would not stimulate public attention\". Local TV news stations in Los Angeles, for instance, are legendary for concentrating on police chases, shootings, Hollywood openings and weather to the virtual exclusion of foreign news. One news station, KFWB, boasts \"you give us 22 minutes and we'll give you the world\", and then produces 22 minutes' worth of stories all of which are based in the US. Recent events in Zimbabwe have largely been covered on TV on the basis of whether it was safe for US tourists to continue with planned holidays to the Victoria Falls. </p> <p>While there is an excellent and vibrant public broadcasting system, some beacons of excellence in the newspaper world and a vast repertoire of \"alternative\" news found everywhere from the internet to small local weeklies, it is the increased power of monopoly and cross-media interests that Project Censored feels is the latest threat to a proper dissemination of news. It is also worth pointing out that many American broadsheet journalists find much of the British press frivolous and partisan. </p> <p>The Censored Project Book also contains another list of winners - the 10 \"most obsessively over-reported stories of the year,\" chosen by the Organisation of News Ombudsmen. Winners for 1999 included: the sexuality of Tinky Winky of the Teletubbies whom rightwing evangelist Jerry Falwell suggested was sending a pro-gay message to children because he (Tinky Winky) was purple and had a purse; Y2K; the new Star Wars film; the death of John F Kennedy Junior; and Pamela Anderson's breasts. </p> <p>The publication of Project Censored could not have come at a more pertinent time. This week, the publisher of the Hearst Corporation's San Francisco Examiner, Timothy White, is taking \"an indefinite leave of absence\" after suggestions that he had offered the city's mayor favourable coverage in last year's mayoral race if he would drop his public opposition to Hearst's proposed takeover of the San Francisco Chronicle (the city's morning paper, which shares a building and profits with the evening Examiner). </p> <p>Meanwhile, what would the top 25 British nominations be? </p> <p><strong>Five issues that never made it</strong></p> <p> 1 <a href=\"http://www.igc.apc.org/dollars/1999/223ganesan.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Corporation Crackdowns</a> by Arvind Ganesan in Dollars and Sense, a Massachusetts-based magazine. This looked at the cooperation between multi-nationals and repressive governments in Burma, India and Turkmenistan. </p> <p> 2 <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/issue/990719/0719silverstein.shtml\" target=\"_NEW\">Millions for Viagra, Pennies for the Poor</a> by Kenneth Silverstein in The Nation. \"In 1998 alone, over six million lives were lost while multi-national pharmaceutical companies catered to the vanity of Americans with lifestyle drugs such as Viagra and anti-wrinkle creams.\" </p> <p> 3 American Cancer Society - the world's wealthiest \"non-profit\" institution, by Dr Samuel Epstein in the International Journal of Health Services. Epstein argued that the organisation had become financially bloated and that of its $677m (\u00a3425m) budget in 1998, $360m went to \"supporting services\" including overheads, salaries and benefits; not enough, he suggested, was spent on actually tackling and preventing cancer. </p> <p> 4 <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mother_jones/MJ99/boal.html\" target=\"_NEW\">An American Sweatshop</a> by Mark Boal in Mother Jones. US military uniforms are being made in sweatshops for the Department of Defence by mainly women workers paid as little as $5.50 an hour. </p> <p> 5 <a href=\"http://www.bullatomsci.org/issues/1999/ma99/ma99mckiernan.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Turkey's War on the Kurds</a>, by Kevin McKeirnan in The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. While 3,000 Kurdish villages were destroyed and 40,000 killed in forcible evacuation, the US assisted the repression for strategic reasons. </p> <p>\u0095 Censored 2000, Peter Phillips and Project Censored, Seven Stories Press, 140 Watts Street, New York, NY10013</p>",

This week, the publisher of the Hearst Corporation's San Francisco Examiner, Timothy White, is taking \"an indefinite leave of absence\" after suggestions that he had offered the city's mayor favourable coverage in last year's mayoral race if he would drop his public opposition to Hearst's proposed takeover of the San Francisco Chronicle (the city's morning paper, which shares a building and profits with the evening Examiner). Meanwhile, what would the top 25 British nominations be? Five issues that never made it 1 Corporation Crackdowns by Arvind Ganesan in Dollars and Sense, a Massachusetts-based magazine. This looked at the cooperation between multi-nationals and repressive governments in Burma, India and Turkmenistan. 2 Millions for Viagra, Pennies for the Poor by Kenneth Silverstein in The Nation. \"In 1998 alone, over six million lives were lost while multi-national pharmaceutical companies catered to the vanity of Americans with lifestyle drugs such as Viagra and anti-wrinkle creams.\" 3 American Cancer Society - the world's wealthiest \"non-profit\" institution, by Dr Samuel Epstein in the International Journal of Health Services. Epstein argued that the organisation had become financially bloated and that of its $677m (\u00a3425m) budget in 1998, $360m went to \"supporting services\" including overheads, salaries and benefits; not enough, he suggested, was spent on actually tackling and preventing cancer. 4 An American Sweatshop by Mark Boal in Mother Jones. US military uniforms are being made in sweatshops for the Department of Defence by mainly women workers paid as little as $5.50 an hour. 5 Turkey's War on the Kurds, by Kevin McKeirnan in The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. While 3,000 Kurdish villages were destroyed and 40,000 killed in forcible evacuation, the US assisted the repression for strategic reasons. \u0095 Censored 2000, Peter Phillips and Project Censored, Seven Stories Press, 140 Watts Street, New York, NY10013",

      "body": "<p>Lager advertising is what made British advertising great. In the 80s, such brands as Heineken, Foster's, Carling Black Label and Holsten Pils all lent themselves to infinitely memorable campaigns that captured the public imagination. They boasted the biggest ad spends of the era and were the hottest creative brief for agencies. </p> <p>In the 90s, the bubble seemed to burst, however, as lager fell out of fashion, spend dipped, and Guinness, John Smith's Bitter and other brews claimed the creative advertising crown. </p> <p>But this week, Whitbread is launching an ambitious new lager, backed by a multi-million pound ad campaign, that it claims captures the cultural zeitgeist and will resurrect this particular advertising sector. </p> <p>The product - the first new standard lager to launch in the UK in a decade - is called GB and is made exclusively from British ingredients. It is being aimed squarely at 18-24 year olds (who apparently account for a third of all lager drunk) and, with a 4.4% alcohol content, is positioned midway between the fuller flavoured, stronger premium lagers and the session standard lagers (the ones you can drink in large quantities without, well, getting too pissed). </p> <p>The name reflects the entire concept behind the brand. GB is meant to be \"a celebration of Britain at its best\", and as with the great lager campaigns of the 80s, its advertising uses distinctively British humour to convey the spirit of the brand. </p> <p>The humour here is very different from the past, however. Gone are the blokeish jokes, the cheap visual gags and football references, and in their place is a new subtlety. In short, the lager lad is dead. </p> <p>Robert Saville, creative director of Mother, the agency behind the campaign, explains: \"We wanted to create a campaign that was culturally relevant again, in the same way it used to be, but we had to move on. Different things are happening comedically, so instead of looking to Benny Hill we looked at newer, quirkier comedies such as the Royle Family, that are more observational and about relationships. You can't keep cracking the dead parrot gag or doing Terry and June again.\" </p> <p>Mother hired Steve Bendelack, a seasoned director of such TV come dies as League of Gentlemen, Friday Night Armistice and even the Royle Family, to direct the ads. </p> <p>Bendelack says: \"The kind of advertising that Mother does coincides with comedy at the moment because it is not presenter-led and about quick laughs, it's about minutiae and nuance. Smack the Pony and the League of Gentlemen are all an accumulation of small performances.\" </p> <p>As a result, the GB ads are not laugh-out-loud funny. There are no men dressed up as bears (think Hofmeister), no silly visual gags (remember Carling Black Label's bouncing bomb?), daft jingles (such as \"Time for a sHarp exit\") or celebrity frontmen (think Paul Hogan for Foster's). Instead there are low-key, almost sophisticated jokes that require more than one viewing to be fully appreciated, the theory now being that an ad becomes instantly disposable if you get it the first time. </p> <p>The four spots, featuring a mix of 40-, 30- and 10-seconders, introduce a new, dysfunctional variation on the Oxo family, the Gibsons. Reminiscent somewhat of Bendelack's own Royle family, this bunch loaf about on a sofa and watch telly all the time, but in this case they are so fond of pubs that they have kitted out their front room like their local. The TV is on a bracket high in the corner of the room, while they also have a fruit machine installed in the corner with flashing lights, and a dartboard. The endline says it all: \"Lager like us\". </p> <p>Each spot similarly shows the Gibsons playing out scenarios usually associated with life down the pub, such as mum cleaning up the room like a barmaid and dad having a croon on the karaoke machine. </p> <p>\"They don't look like any other lager advertising I've ever seen. Put Heineken or Foster's next to them - they've all got lots of lads with fast cuts to football tracks, but these have a really fresh, modern look. The best compliment would be if people thought no ad agency was involved,\" says Saville. </p> <p>Whitbread has also spread this new style of humour right across the brand, embracing the packaging and presentation as well as the advertising. The logo, for example, is the GB sticker you see stuck on the back of the average family saloon motoring across to the continent. And instead of the usual bar pumps, GB will also be served through a giant chrome bathroom tap. </p> <p>Not only has the brewing giant moved the tone and the humour on, it is also aiming its new product at women as well as men - the first time that women have ever been targeted in this way. </p> <p>Sophie Spence, development brands director of Whitbread, comments: \"Lager is important to women as an alcohol category. The national brewers have traditionally ignored females as part of their targeting, hence their sexist gag advertising, but GB is unisex in its appeal and is targeting both men and women with a unisex humour and cultural associations.\" </p> <p>Amazingly, lager is the biggest alcohol category for women - 69% of women drink beer in pubs, compared with only 8% who drink wine, and beer drinking has particularly increased among younger women recently: over the past three years the number of young women regularly drinking draught lager has increased from 36.5% to 39%. </p> <p>John Webster, executive creative director of BMP DDB and the creative brains behind George the Hofmeister bear, comments: \"In the 80s there was a lot of money spent on lager and the whole tone of the advertising was about having a good time and getting away from the wife. The laddishness and chauvinism was part of what made it great and the thing to do was to get blokes quoting the campaign down the pub. But times have changed: ladies are the new lads now. They are rude, and all their icons, like Zoe Ball, drink pints, so it is valid to target them.\" </p> <p>Whitbread is ambitious about its new product. It is investing a multi-million pound spend behind the TV, poster and cinema campaign, which begins in the Granada region tonight before rolling out nationally. Its plan is that when young folk go down the pub, they will specify \"a pint of GB\" when asking for lager, because research shows that around two thirds of lager orders are currently generic. </p> <p>Whether the brewing giant succeeds in this mission will be up to the discerning youth of Britain, but either way, Mother would appear to have injected new life into what has been one of the nation's best-loved advertising sectors. </p> <p><strong>Five vintage lager campaigns from the 80s</strong></p> <p><strong> Carling Black Label</strong><br> Lager advertising possibly reached its zenith with the Carling Black Label Dambusters spot of 1990, featuring comedy duo the Oblivion Brothers. </p> <p>Ranked 17 in the recent Channel 4 show 100 Greatest TV Ads, the commercial spoofed the famous war movie of the same name, involving two pilots of a Lancaster bomber dropping a series of bouncing bombs on a German dam and the sentry on duty catching them as they bounce towards him. One of the pilots retorts: \"I bet he drinks Carling Black Label.\" It was probably one of the best-ever movie spoofs. </p> <p><strong> Hofmeister</strong><br> A typically laddish lager campaign this, in which a short bloke (in fact he was played by a Hungarian dwarf) dressed up as George the Hofmeister bear in a pork pie hat and yellow jacket and strutted down the street, pursued by a gormless following of sexist male hangers-on. \"Follow the bear\" was the slogan, and the campaign, which ran from 1983 until 1988, simply brought that to life. Unfortunately, however, George was deemed to encourage laddish, anti-women behaviour and he was axed. </p> <p><strong> Heineken</strong><br> This campaign introduced the ultimate advertising slogan \"Heineken refreshes the parts other beers cannot reach\". It launched in 1974 and there were over 100 ads in the campaign, which won over 300 creative awards along the way. </p> <p>The slogan gained official approval in 1998 when it was included in the Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations. Many of the ads became comedy classics, such as the Wordsworth execution, in which inspiration for the bard was elusive until he swigged a Heineken. \"I walked about a bit on my own\" became \"I wandered lonely as a cloud\" after a can of Heineken. </p> <p><strong> Harp</strong><br> Similarly juvenile antics combined with cheap visual gags for Harp with a campaign in which blokes extricated themselves from embarrassing situations with the line: \"Time for a sHarp exit.\" One famous execution featured a young man on a first date arriving at the woman's flat. She has a particularly yappy dog which he tries to entertain by throwing a ball. A series of improbable ricochets make the ball bounce out of the window, however - with the dog jumping out in hot pursuit. Cue endline. </p> <p><strong> Foster's</strong><br> Foster's advertising between 1984 and 1990 featured Oz comic Paul Hogan playing a predictably sexist, uncomplicated Australian bloke with his \"pint of amber nectar\". As such he led the way in Australian-style beer advertising (think also Castlemaine XXXX). The campaign kicked off with possibly one of the most memorable spots, in which Hogan goes to the ballet and is startled to see a male dancer in tights. The line \"Strewth, there's a bloke down there with no strides on\" subsequently entered the vernacular.</p>",

I've been attending it for six years, as the BBC music executive responsible for the UK's annual entry, and the most fascinating aspect has always seemed to me to be the enormous and varied media attention it attracts. Whether at home in Birmingham, as it was in 1998 after we had won the contest with Katrina and the Waves the previous year (each year's victorious country hosts the next year's contest), or in Stockholm last weekend, the phenomenal number of journalists, TV crews, radio interviewers and commentators is staggering. </p> <p>I've covered American presidential conventions and worldwide charity concerts. I've been to key sporting events and vast festivals. I've coped with producing big TV programmes such as The Brits and The Record of the Year Show. But Eurovision is the one event that constantly astonishes me by the size and spread of intense interest. </p> <p>You cannot hope to have a quiet meal or a peaceful night out in the city without bumping into teams of foreign reporters. If you wear your badge (and there are seven different colours allowing access to all the areas of the show, from backstage to on stage), you can guarantee that during the evening several people will come up to you and introduce themselves as writers for the Croatian Gazette or the Cypriot Star. </p> <p>Well, look at it this way. Twenty four countries, for a start, with three or four newspapers, a couple of TV networks and half a dozen radio stations each. They all attend the event, hoping that a little local teenager will become, thanks to Eurovision, the next Madonna and give them a great regional interest story at the same time. And let's be honest, kids having their hearts broken because of the lack of taste of the global televoters provides an equally lively headline. Twenty three out of the 24 entrants are losers, after all. </p> <p>Then throw in the global fascination. America has dozens of representatives - California alone sent several TV crews this year. Fred Bronson, Billboard's veteran reporter, regards it as the music event of the year and flies in from Hollywood every May to cover it. </p> <p>Australians are always there. Likewise, the obligatory Japanese (is there anything they don't cover?). This year, I met a journalist from Taiwan, a TV crew from China and two radio hosts from a small station in Vietnam. I've obtained the official list of the 987 media members. This includes Duane Zigliotto from Sydney, New South Wales (I'd have guessed Naples), Emir Hacimic from Bosnia Hercegovina, Jegors Jerohomovics from Latvia (made-up name?), Alexei Smirnov from Russia (ditto), and Angel Galleco-Vega from the United Kingdom (who are you fooling, Angel, why not just admit Puerto Rico?). </p> <p>The last two names on the list, for some reason, are Bruce, Ken and Wogan, Terry. Never heard of them. </p> <p>And Eurovision never lets its audience down. Even those ghastly rightwing religious fascists in Jerusalem last year could grin with delight when transsexual Dana International tripped on her high heels and sprawled all over the stage in front of hundreds of millions. God got his own back, they decided. But Dana didn't mind. She takes herself considerably less seriously than her opponents do. </p> <p>So why is it that the ancient, non-credible, localised phenomenon of Eurovision has become the global magnet for virtually every media representative? </p> <p>I think it's because it's so good- hearted. There really is a terrific feeling of bonhomie. Nobody can take pop music that seriously. By definition it's fun, superficial, transitory and frothy. Nobody's dying. There are no wars or famines. It doesn't elect leaders or praise greatness. It's an evening of laughter and joy and frivolity. Which, after all, incorporates the essence of humanity. </p> <p>Eurovision attracts the media people for exactly the same reasons that viewers love it. We all love a trip to somewhere different, a few days not having to concentrate on heavy issues, an excuse to giggle and gossip and laugh. I reckon that if you polled the greatest news gatherers in the world on their favourite event of the year, Eurovision would come out on top. And quite right too.</p>",

This includes Duane Zigliotto from Sydney, New South Wales (I'd have guessed Naples), Emir Hacimic from Bosnia Hercegovina, Jegors Jerohomovics from Latvia (made-up name?), Alexei Smirnov from Russia (ditto), and Angel Galleco-Vega from the United Kingdom (who are you fooling, Angel, why not just admit Puerto Rico?). The last two names on the list, for some reason, are Bruce, Ken and Wogan, Terry. Never heard of them. And Eurovision never lets its audience down. Even those ghastly rightwing religious fascists in Jerusalem last year could grin with delight when transsexual Dana International tripped on her high heels and sprawled all over the stage in front of hundreds of millions. God got his own back, they decided. But Dana didn't mind. She takes herself considerably less seriously than her opponents do. So why is it that the ancient, non-credible, localised phenomenon of Eurovision has become the global magnet for virtually every media representative? I think it's because it's so good- hearted. There really is a terrific feeling of bonhomie. Nobody can take pop music that seriously. By definition it's fun, superficial, transitory and frothy. Nobody's dying. There are no wars or famines. It doesn't elect leaders or praise greatness. It's an evening of laughter and joy and frivolity. Which, after all, incorporates the essence of humanity. Eurovision attracts the media people for exactly the same reasons that viewers love it. We all love a trip to somewhere different, a few days not having to concentrate on heavy issues, an excuse to giggle and gossip and laugh. I reckon that if you polled the greatest news gatherers in the world on their favourite event of the year, Eurovision would come out on top. And quite right too.",

      "body": "<p>At the apex of the Cannes film festival's all-important first weekend, Joel and Ethan Coen's broad and hyperactive comedy of the deep south was unveiled. <strong> O Brother, Where Art Thou?</strong> is a zany Depression tale - claiming kinship with both Homer's Odyssey and Preston Sturges's Sullivan's Travels - about three Mississippi chain gang prisoners on the run and looking for buried loot. They meet a hitch-hiker called Tommy who claims to have sold his soul to the devil to play blues guitar, and together the outlaws cut a bluegrass record, which becomes a smash hit while the escapees hightail it across the swampy terrain pursued by the familiar lawmen with their traditional reflecting sunglasses and slobbering bloodhounds. </p> <p>George Clooney is the ringleader, Everett Ulysses McGill, perpetually fussing with his pomade and hair net and sporting a raffish, faintly Mediterranean moustache. It is strange to see him in another three-guys-and-a-treasure-map movie so soon after Three Kings. He is maturing as a comic performer, however, and he carries the picture with virility and brio. Unlike many a TV-bred name, he has somehow developed the mass and dimensions of a big-screen romantic lead or action hero. But sadly John Turturro as Pete, one of his two sidekicks, is a bit dull and unresponsive, his face permanently stuck in a good ol' boy expression. </p> <p>O Brother takes its Homeric duties fairly seriously, with sirens tempting our boys and Everett finally returning to his faithless Penelope, played by Holly Hunter. But the parallels don't add much and 30s Mississippi is a pretty dry comic landscape compared with, say, 1912 Dublin. The Coens' Sturges homage resides in the chain-gang details, and the moments in the picture show and old-time religion congregation, but it does not exactly match or develop Sturges's view of what real poverty is and what real film-makers can really do about it. That said, O Brother has enormous gaiety and a terrific soundtrack, and deserves its overwhelming position as the \"choice of the Croisette\" - Cannes's feelgood movie. </p> <p><strong> Nurse Betty</strong> by Neil LaBute is a comedy about a sweet-natured waitress who is unhinged by witnessing her corrupt husband's murder, and travels to Los Angeles to marry a handsome doctor in the hospital soap with which she is obsessed. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger gives a wonderfully warm performance as Betty, and her bewilderment when confronted by an obviously fake hospital set is a joy to behold, as is the lupine nastiness of Aaron Eckhart, her spouse. But TV's fake \u00fcber -reality is a familiar theme, and this film has Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock stuck in a tiresome and underwritten comic subplot about Del's two killers. Nurse Betty is fun, but we were expecting something meaner and tougher from the creator of In the Company of Men. </p> <p> Liv Ullmann's <strong> Faithless</strong>, from a screenplay by Ingmar Bergman, is an agonising anatomy of a failed marriage and could not be more vieux chapeau as far as this festival audience was concerned. Many was the rifle-crack of the raised seat as the hours crept past. And yet this compulsive searching of the wounds, containing extravagant fantasies of emotional cruelty, was still riveting. </p> <p>The Wooden Spoon d'Or (if that isn't a contradiction) goes to Dave Stewart for <strong> Honest</strong>, a gangsta-gal movie shown out of competition, and resembling a Camden High School for Girls school play. Set in the swinging 60s, it stars All Saints as three feisty babes who rob banks - and who say their lines as if reading them off an optician's chart. For their capers, our heroines disguise themselves as chaps with fake chin hair etc, and then pointlessly wear masks. Tragically, this is scripted by the great Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Sitting there stunned in the auditorium, my facial expression resembled James Bolam in The Likely Lads.</p>",

Ren\u00e9e Zellweger gives a wonderfully warm performance as Betty, and her bewilderment when confronted by an obviously fake hospital set is a joy to behold, as is the lupine nastiness of Aaron Eckhart, her spouse. But TV's fake \u00fcber -reality is a familiar theme, and this film has Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock stuck in a tiresome and underwritten comic subplot about Del's two killers. Nurse Betty is fun, but we were expecting something meaner and tougher from the creator of In the Company of Men. Liv Ullmann's Faithless, from a screenplay by Ingmar Bergman, is an agonising anatomy of a failed marriage and could not be more vieux chapeau as far as this festival audience was concerned. Many was the rifle-crack of the raised seat as the hours crept past. And yet this compulsive searching of the wounds, containing extravagant fantasies of emotional cruelty, was still riveting. The Wooden Spoon d'Or (if that isn't a contradiction) goes to Dave Stewart for Honest, a gangsta-gal movie shown out of competition, and resembling a Camden High School for Girls school play. Set in the swinging 60s, it stars All Saints as three feisty babes who rob banks - and who say their lines as if reading them off an optician's chart. For their capers, our heroines disguise themselves as chaps with fake chin hair etc, and then pointlessly wear masks. Tragically, this is scripted by the great Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Sitting there stunned in the auditorium, my facial expression resembled James Bolam in The Likely Lads.",

Chatting with the Boston Globe newspaper, Figgis declared: \"[Lucas] is really not interested in putting a camera in his pocket and running around with it. His camera will cost in the region of \u00a3100,000, will compete with the finest 35mm camera, and will require the equivalent of a team of brain surgeons to maintain it. The revolution is not going to come from that particular citadel.\" Warming to his theme, the bearded Leaving Las Vegas auteur got provocative: \"I mean, with all due respect, who's George Lucas? He's basically a very rich phenomenon who's interested in a certain kind of technology and children's storytelling.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government's love affair with the private sector in education will move forward by leaps and bounds on Wednesday, when ministers announce a significant expansion of the list of approved contractors who will be given the opportunity to take over failing state schools. Critics, already unnerved by the fact that Labour ministers are relying heavily on the private sector to take over the problems of state education from poorly-performing local education authorities, may be alarmed by the presence of new entrants such as the security organisation Group 4. Yet upon further investigation it emerges that the organisation - which had a tricky and highly-publicised start in prison outsourcing - will have only a limited role as part of a consortium called the Tribal Group. The widening of the \"net\" of approved contractors shows that not only is the government extremely serious about getting the private sector involved in education, but that it wants to tap into a wider range of expertise. Until now the market has been dominated by specialist education providers and consultants such as Nord Anglia and Cambridge Education Associates. Clearly the Department for Education and Employment cannot afford to have all its eggs in one baskets and to see a relatively small number of players pick up large numbers of lucrative contracts. Local education authorities with a good track record are also being encouraged to spread their good practice. The new contractors being named on Wednesday include Camden local education authority.

There are also places for Steven Gerrard and Steve McManaman. Despite the changes in personnel and continuing lack of left-footers - Barmby is the latest to be mooted for left-midfield - Koogan insisted there will be \"no experimenting\" from now on.

      "bodyText": "KOOGAN'S CRUNCH TIME Kelvin Koogan today slipped on a blindfold, stuck his hand 28 times into a box marked All Living Englishmen and named a provisional squad for the Euro 2000 championships in Holland and Belgium. His real squad is likely to be announced after the friendly against Ukraine at the end of this month. Which gives Andy Cole three weeks to say something unwise to the papers and get himself dropped. Cole, against the expectations of most, has made it to the final 28 and is still in with a shout for a trip to the lowlands. The 22-goal Manchester United striker is named alongside Robbie Fowler in a list of six strikers and has an opportunity to benefit from the Liverpool man's lack of fitness and mysterious non-falling out with Gerard Houllier at the weekend. What could famous disciplinarian Houllier and 'reformed' Fowler not have fallen out over, we wonder? Even better news arrived for David James and Nick Barmby, who have returned to the squad after two and three respective years in the wilderness. There are also places for Steven Gerrard and Steve McManaman. Despite the changes in personnel and continuing lack of left-footers - Barmby is the latest to be mooted for left-midfield - Koogan insisted there will be \"no experimenting\" from now on. Which presumably means England will continue to play both 4-4-2 and 3-5-2 this summer. England squad to face Brazil on May 27, Ukraine on May 31 and Malta on June 3: Seaman (Arsenal), Martyn (Leeds), Wright (Ipswich), James (Aston Villa), P Neville (Man Utd), G Neville (Man Utd), Ferdinand (West Ham), Campbell (Tottenham), Adams (Arsenal), Keown (Arsenal), Southgate (Aston Villa), Beckham (Man Utd), Wise (Chelsea), Ince (Middlesbrough), Redknapp (Liverpool), Dyer (Newcastle), Barmby (Everton), Parlour (Arsenal), Scholes (Man Utd), Wilcox (Leeds), Gerrard (Liverpool), McManaman (Real Madrid), Shearer (Newcastle), Owen (Liverpool), Cole (Man Utd), Heskey (Liverpool), Phillips (Sunderland), Fowler (Liverpool). * * * * * * * * * * * * * YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MAD TO CLICK HERE, AND NEITHER DOES IT HELP Need to know what's happening in the world of Marketing Advertising and Design?

But he also points out that its proposal is the only game in town. Mr Trimble will also be pressing for police reform proposals to be trimmed, as a sweetener for the hardline rejectionists in his own party. He wants the RUC to retain its name and crown-and-harp badge, as powerful symbols of the union. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has warned that last-minute haggling by the unionists could scupper the entire process. The Irish Times, too, has urged the British and Irish governments to stand by their pledge for wholesale reforms of the police service. To retain the force's royal title, says the paper, would be as unacceptable as renaming it the Republican Ulster Constabulary. But the highly respected Dublin daily acknowledges that Mr Trimble should not be sent empty-handed to face his party council on Saturday. It suggests that a generous offer to compensate wounded and traumatised police officers could help to assuage loyalist opinion. As the arguments swirl, there are more tangible signs that the new disarmament formula is taking shape. The two international observers with the formidable task of inspecting and sealing the IRA's weapons dumps are already on their way to Belfast, after talks in Downing Street with Mr Blair and Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson. Cyril Ramaphosa, former secretary general of the African National Congress and Martti Ahtisaari, former president of Finland, are due to meet the head of the arms decommissioning body, Canadian General John de Chastelain. They could start their ultra-sensitive task as early as next week - but only if the 860-strong Ulster Unionist Council swallows its scruples and its pride, and lifts its veto on power-sharing.

By the end of the day, 45 will have died, six of them children. I'm assuming you spend a happy hour with the Guardian; the mortality rate from bullets is 90 every 24 hours, 12 of them youngsters. Why should it need a Million Mom March to get guns under control? The answer lies in some misapprehension and corruption.</p> <p>The Republican majority in Congress, and GW Bush, the Republican candidate for the presidency, won't hear of anything which interferes with \"a citizen's right to bear arms\". Not since Clive of India (1725-74) stood amazed at his own moderation in taking gifts, has bribery been defended with such impudence. The plain fact is the Congressmen are on the take from the gun lobby, the National Rifle Association (NRA), which spends 80% of its multimillion dollar war chest on GOP campaigns, but they present themselves as tribunes of the Second Amendment. The reverence of the gun lobby and their pawns in Congress for the Second does not extend to reading it. It is all of 27 words: \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" They always have difficulty remembering the first 13 words, which just happens to be the historic heart of the matter.</p> <p>The amendment was a compromise among the framers of the constitution, between the federalists who wanted a standing federal army and the antifederalists who feared it might be used to suppress liberty. So the compromise was agreed, that states could arm citizen militias as a check on the federal government. And so they did. They are the National Guard.</p> <p>The hundreds of thousands who turned out on the Mall on Mother's Day have been caricatured by the Second Amendment crowd as \"Million Moms for Muggers\". An attempt was made to rouse other women to join an Armed Informed Mothers' March accusing the gun controllers of wanting to deprive women of self-defence against abusive husbands, rapists and intruders. They do not. They appreciate that a ban on guns would be hard to sell in a country that has about 200m of them, shared in some unknowable proportion between citizens, cops, hunters, marksmen, collectors and criminals. All the Moms plead is for licensing and registering of handguns, with waiting periods and trigger locks on new weapons. Such laws won't soon stop the mayhem, but they would do something to reduce accidents, help track weapons used in crime, and keep guns out of the hands of kids, criminals and the demented.</p> <p>The Million Mom march ought to help Gore against Bush. Women, far more than men, are for stricter gun laws (67%, only 28% among men). To a single-issue woman voter there should be no choice. Gore is with them without weasel words. Bush is not. He talks of \"voluntary\" restraint, of preferring to enforce existing laws. Bush, in fact, has always been an NRA man. In 1997 he approved a law in Texas preventing the prosecution of people who brought guns to church. When two years later seven worshippers in a Fort Worth Baptist church were shot to death, Gore called for a ban on the kind of automatic assault weapons used in the massacre. Bush wrung pious hands. \"I don't know of a law,\" he said, \"that will put love in people's hearts.\"</p> <p>The march has left two questions: will the Moms help to make guns a single issue? Support for stricter laws has recently been ebbing in the wake of a clever NRA advertising campaign putting the focus on enforcement of existing laws. And will Gore's support for the Moms win him enough votes to offset losses among white men where he already trails by double digits?</p> <p>Some Democrats don't think it is worth Gore taking the risk. Party men in pivotal \"hunting\" states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania want him to back off because he has been shedding male voters without gaining women. Bush, a rightwing libertarian at heart, is now doing his best to muddle things by imitating a moderate progressive. On the eve of the march, he announced he would vote for funds to provide free trigger locks. He has also been coming out with social policy initiatives that have the patina of reform, and his boyish charm has gone down well on TV talk shows. Women have in the past few months been wooed from a 48-42% preference for Gore in March to a 47-43% preference for Bush now. Boyish charm and bullets don't mix, but we'll soon see how far America's women have fallen for it.</p> <p>Harold Evans is the author of The American Century.</p> <p>comment@theguardian.com</p>",

Not since Clive of India (1725-74) stood amazed at his own moderation in taking gifts, has bribery been defended with such impudence. The plain fact is the Congressmen are on the take from the gun lobby, the National Rifle Association (NRA), which spends 80% of its multimillion dollar war chest on GOP campaigns, but they present themselves as tribunes of the Second Amendment. The reverence of the gun lobby and their pawns in Congress for the Second does not extend to reading it. It is all of 27 words: \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" They always have difficulty remembering the first 13 words, which just happens to be the historic heart of the matter. The amendment was a compromise among the framers of the constitution, between the federalists who wanted a standing federal army and the antifederalists who feared it might be used to suppress liberty. So the compromise was agreed, that states could arm citizen militias as a check on the federal government. And so they did. They are the National Guard. The hundreds of thousands who turned out on the Mall on Mother's Day have been caricatured by the Second Amendment crowd as \"Million Moms for Muggers\". An attempt was made to rouse other women to join an Armed Informed Mothers' March accusing the gun controllers of wanting to deprive women of self-defence against abusive husbands, rapists and intruders. They do not. They appreciate that a ban on guns would be hard to sell in a country that has about 200m of them, shared in some unknowable proportion between citizens, cops, hunters, marksmen, collectors and criminals. All the Moms plead is for licensing and registering of handguns, with waiting periods and trigger locks on new weapons. Such laws won't soon stop the mayhem, but they would do something to reduce accidents, help track weapons used in crime, and keep guns out of the hands of kids, criminals and the demented. The Million Mom march ought to help Gore against Bush. Women, far more than men, are for stricter gun laws (67%, only 28% among men). To a single-issue woman voter there should be no choice. Gore is with them without weasel words. Bush is not. He talks of \"voluntary\" restraint, of preferring to enforce existing laws. Bush, in fact, has always been an NRA man. In 1997 he approved a law in Texas preventing the prosecution of people who brought guns to church. When two years later seven worshippers in a Fort Worth Baptist church were shot to death, Gore called for a ban on the kind of automatic assault weapons used in the massacre. Bush wrung pious hands. \"I don't know of a law,\" he said, \"that will put love in people's hearts.\" The march has left two questions: will the Moms help to make guns a single issue? Support for stricter laws has recently been ebbing in the wake of a clever NRA advertising campaign putting the focus on enforcement of existing laws. And will Gore's support for the Moms win him enough votes to offset losses among white men where he already trails by double digits? Some Democrats don't think it is worth Gore taking the risk. Party men in pivotal \"hunting\" states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania want him to back off because he has been shedding male voters without gaining women. Bush, a rightwing libertarian at heart, is now doing his best to muddle things by imitating a moderate progressive. On the eve of the march, he announced he would vote for funds to provide free trigger locks. He has also been coming out with social policy initiatives that have the patina of reform, and his boyish charm has gone down well on TV talk shows. Women have in the past few months been wooed from a 48-42% preference for Gore in March to a 47-43% preference for Bush now. Boyish charm and bullets don't mix, but we'll soon see how far America's women have fallen for it. Harold Evans is the author of The American Century. comment@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The Yugoslav government yesterday announced a major crackdown on the country's main opposition groups, accusing them of masterminding the murder of a senior official in President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Socialist party on behalf of Nato. A day after Bosko Perosevic, 43, head of the Vojvodina provincial government and chief of a Socialist party branch there, was shot dead at a trade fair, the government claimed the student organisation Otpor and the Serbian Renewal Movement were behind the attack and would be punished. \"All who perform activities against the state will be treated in accordance with the law. The time of their street actions is over,\" the informa tion minister, Goran Matic, said. Police said they had found \"beyond doubt\" that the suspected gunman, Milivoj Gutovic, 50, was an activist with Otpor and the Serbian Renewal Movement. Mr Gutovic, a security guard at the Novi Sad exhibition, allegedly approached Perosevic at an agricultural fair on Saturday, pressed a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. He was immediately arrested. Both groups have denied links with the killing or the gunman. Mr Matic said Nato was behind the killing. \"This was not a work of a single maniac, but an organised murder with a deep political background, with the aim to destabilise Yugoslavia,\" he said. He said a number of arrests had been made in connection with the murder, but would not say how many. Asked if opposition activists who are expected to hold a rally in Belgrade today would face arrest, he said: \"That is correct.\" In a speech at a memorial service for Perosevic attended by Mr Milosevic yesterday, the secretary general of the ruling Socialists, Gorica Gajevic, called Otpor \"ordinary Nato mercenaries\". An Otpor activist in Belgrade, Ivan Marovic, said yesterday that a number of the groups' activists have been arrested in several towns, but some were released after lengthy questioning.",

Former secretary general of the African National Congress, Cyril Ramaphosa, and former Finland president, Martti Ahtisaari, will report to the head of the international decommissioning body, General John de Chastelain, on the arms stores. They will arrive in Belfast for talks with Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson and the Irish foreign affairs minister after brief discussions in London with prime minister Tony Blair this morning. Their appointment was one of the pieces of the jigsaw put together by Mr Blair and Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern as part of their plan to get the Stormont assembly and ministerial executive up and running again next week. Crucial to that was last weekend's IRA statement which offered to put its weapons \"beyond use\" and to allow independent observers to inspect a number of its arms dumps and to return regularly for reinspections to confirm that they had not been used. The inspections will go ahead \"come what may\", Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness said. It was not dependent on the resumption of the devolved power-sharing administration.

Council officials began day-to-day monitoring. John Leovald, the former head of Acton high, west London, was given direct responsibility for sorting out behaviour. Specialist subject advisers were drafted in to meet heads of faculty.</p> <p>Mr Friedag was asked not to leave the school during normal hours. Officials complained Mr Friedag was not keeping them in the picture.</p> <p>In turn, an unhappy Mr Friedag complained about a lack of support from the governors, and from local and central government. There were unrealistic expectations, the political will was not there when things got tough. He felt powerless to exclude some disruptive pupils. There was not enough help for the pupils of some 29 national cultures.</p> <p>The critical view of Mr Friedag virtually became the official version when school inspectors visited 17 days after he resigned. When Dr Hudson arrived, the inspector delivered a stinging letter to him, which was precised in his letter to parents.</p> <p>\"In the view of HMI there were no clear management systems in place, strategic leadership was weak and there was poor communication at all levels. There is no school development plan nor a clear strategy to develop a distinctive ethos to reflect an arts and media school. Systems which could help the management of the school are weak or dysfunctional. Students' behaviour is unsatisfactory overall.\"</p> <p>Explaining why he needed to close the school for two weeks, Dr Hudson said: \"We need time to make sufficient progress for a substantial change to take place. Students at the school deserve a great deal better than this.\"</p> <p>Under the chairmanship of Richard Rieser, formerly a leftwing activist for the National Union of Teachers, the new board of governors produced a position statement, with strong views on the previous regime. They criticised the decision to get rid of the former teachers. They accused Mr Friedag of having \"misled\" them and accused Islington council of \"gross mishandling\" of the redevelopment programme. And they demanded that the new controllers write off a budget deficit which may reach \u00a3800,000.</p> <p>There is some sunlight. The governors like Dr Hudson, a methodical planner. He wants to \"keep the temperature low\".</p> <p>The fresh Fresh Start will be, for good or ill, a return to traditional ways. Less ambitious. Back to basics, some say. \"We are going back to being an inner-city, neighbourhood comprehensive,\" says Mr Rieser.</p>",

In February, after a fraught meeting between the council and the school's governing body, Islington started to take on Mr Friedag. Council officials began day-to-day monitoring. John Leovald, the former head of Acton high, west London, was given direct responsibility for sorting out behaviour. Specialist subject advisers were drafted in to meet heads of faculty. Mr Friedag was asked not to leave the school during normal hours. Officials complained Mr Friedag was not keeping them in the picture. In turn, an unhappy Mr Friedag complained about a lack of support from the governors, and from local and central government. There were unrealistic expectations, the political will was not there when things got tough. He felt powerless to exclude some disruptive pupils. There was not enough help for the pupils of some 29 national cultures. The critical view of Mr Friedag virtually became the official version when school inspectors visited 17 days after he resigned. When Dr Hudson arrived, the inspector delivered a stinging letter to him, which was precised in his letter to parents. \"In the view of HMI there were no clear management systems in place, strategic leadership was weak and there was poor communication at all levels. There is no school development plan nor a clear strategy to develop a distinctive ethos to reflect an arts and media school. Systems which could help the management of the school are weak or dysfunctional. Students' behaviour is unsatisfactory overall.\" Explaining why he needed to close the school for two weeks, Dr Hudson said: \"We need time to make sufficient progress for a substantial change to take place. Students at the school deserve a great deal better than this.\" Under the chairmanship of Richard Rieser, formerly a leftwing activist for the National Union of Teachers, the new board of governors produced a position statement, with strong views on the previous regime. They criticised the decision to get rid of the former teachers. They accused Mr Friedag of having \"misled\" them and accused Islington council of \"gross mishandling\" of the redevelopment programme. And they demanded that the new controllers write off a budget deficit which may reach \u00a3800,000. There is some sunlight. The governors like Dr Hudson, a methodical planner. He wants to \"keep the temperature low\". The fresh Fresh Start will be, for good or ill, a return to traditional ways. Less ambitious. Back to basics, some say. \"We are going back to being an inner-city, neighbourhood comprehensive,\" says Mr Rieser.",
