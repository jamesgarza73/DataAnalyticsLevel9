      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>England exceeded all expectations, even their own, in Lahore yesterday as they ground Pakistan into the dust. Four big innings have cheered the nation as England continue to improve their standing on the world stage. What an opportunity, even before halfway in this Test, for the England and Wales Cricket Board to show off the team in the best light. </p> <p>Unfortunately this is where the ECB continually seems to let itself down. At tea yesterday, with England on 341 for five and playing gloriously, a request by Sky Television to talk to Mike Atherton or Marcus Trescothick, two of Wednesday's heroes, was turned down by the media relations manager of the ECB, Andrew Walpole, on the ground that it did not want to over-expose Trescothick. This was rubbish. Cricket, particularly English cricket, and its players need all the good publicity they can get at the moment. </p> <p>As things stand, we still await news of a sponsor for next year's seven Test matches in England, two domestic competitions are without sponsors, and there has been a financial shortfall on Test-match receipts last summer, which will have dire consequences for the counties. </p> <p>Let us not blame the players here, they are contracted employees and will do as they are told. Their interest in interviews is weak at times but primarily this is down to a lack of enthusiasm by the ECB to latch on to a good thing when it stares it in the face. </p> <p>The media, especially television, are interested in interviewing successful individuals and congratulating them on their efforts. As well, captains and coaches take the rap when things go badly and, however much they dislike giving interviews in those situations, it goes with the job. Basically it is a simple matter of giving the people what they want. </p> <p>Should the media relations men at the ECB need any pointers they need only look to other sports, some far more successful in attracting the sponsors' dollar. Golfers are made immediately available to the media as soon as they leave the 18th green, tennis players after they leave the court, rugby and football players as they go up the tunnel to the dressing room. Martin Brundle interviews drivers on the grid before formula one races, and the 500cc grand prix motorcyclists are told to keep their helmets off until the last possible moment before the start so that they can be more publicly recognisable. </p> <p>Yesterday's refusal by the ECB is not an isolated incident. Last December in Durban Gary Kirsten, after scoring a double hundred for South Africa and saving the Test match, was declared joint man of the match with Andrew Caddick. The South African cricket board's media man brought Kirsten up to the studio and offered him for interview. Where was Caddick? On the team bus, of course. Again, this was not the player's fault but showed a complete lack of awareness by the media relations men of when to capitalise on a positive. </p> <p>The great majority of the England team are good in front of the camera and welcome the opportunity to promote themselves and the game. But, even when they are doing well, they need encouragement to do so. Graham Thorpe's interview was informative and sparky after his 118, he even dedicated his century to his son Jack, but he wouldn't have been allowed to talk to the media if he'd been 118 not out at the close of play. The ECB says so. </p> <p>The time has come for a television media relations manager, appointed by the television companies and the ECB, to take control of this aspect and help promote the game of cricket in the best possible way. Yesterday seemed an ideal opportunity to begin the process.</p>",

At tea yesterday, with England on 341 for five and playing gloriously, a request by Sky Television to talk to Mike Atherton or Marcus Trescothick, two of Wednesday's heroes, was turned down by the media relations manager of the ECB, Andrew Walpole, on the ground that it did not want to over-expose Trescothick. This was rubbish. Cricket, particularly English cricket, and its players need all the good publicity they can get at the moment. As things stand, we still await news of a sponsor for next year's seven Test matches in England, two domestic competitions are without sponsors, and there has been a financial shortfall on Test-match receipts last summer, which will have dire consequences for the counties. Let us not blame the players here, they are contracted employees and will do as they are told. Their interest in interviews is weak at times but primarily this is down to a lack of enthusiasm by the ECB to latch on to a good thing when it stares it in the face. The media, especially television, are interested in interviewing successful individuals and congratulating them on their efforts. As well, captains and coaches take the rap when things go badly and, however much they dislike giving interviews in those situations, it goes with the job. Basically it is a simple matter of giving the people what they want. Should the media relations men at the ECB need any pointers they need only look to other sports, some far more successful in attracting the sponsors' dollar. Golfers are made immediately available to the media as soon as they leave the 18th green, tennis players after they leave the court, rugby and football players as they go up the tunnel to the dressing room. Martin Brundle interviews drivers on the grid before formula one races, and the 500cc grand prix motorcyclists are told to keep their helmets off until the last possible moment before the start so that they can be more publicly recognisable. Yesterday's refusal by the ECB is not an isolated incident. Last December in Durban Gary Kirsten, after scoring a double hundred for South Africa and saving the Test match, was declared joint man of the match with Andrew Caddick. The South African cricket board's media man brought Kirsten up to the studio and offered him for interview. Where was Caddick? On the team bus, of course. Again, this was not the player's fault but showed a complete lack of awareness by the media relations men of when to capitalise on a positive. The great majority of the England team are good in front of the camera and welcome the opportunity to promote themselves and the game. But, even when they are doing well, they need encouragement to do so. Graham Thorpe's interview was informative and sparky after his 118, he even dedicated his century to his son Jack, but he wouldn't have been allowed to talk to the media if he'd been 118 not out at the close of play. The ECB says so. The time has come for a television media relations manager, appointed by the television companies and the ECB, to take control of this aspect and help promote the game of cricket in the best possible way. Yesterday seemed an ideal opportunity to begin the process.",

      "bodyText": "The BBC and ITV may stop using exit polls in their coverage of elections, following the US networks' mistakes in reporting the US election 10 days ago. BBC head of current affairs Peter Horrocks said he would approach Steve Anderson, ITV's head of news, current affairs, religion and arts, about thrashing out an agreement to reduce broadcasters' reliance on exit polls to call election results. The system was blamed by American Network News for errors during the US election campaign. Mr Horrocks said that BBC and ITN had in the past discussed creating a pooled exit poll service but had decided against it, preferring to hang on to their competitive edge. Mr Anderson said he disagreed with a pooled exit poll system, but said: \"We have to consider whether exit polls are really viable. Is it a price worth paying if we risk tearing our reputations to shreds?\" News chiefs in America are still conducting post-mortems on the election fiasco, which saw several networks inaccurately reporting victory for George W Bush after Fox Network called the result based on an exit poll. Delegates at the Newsworld conference in Barcelona agreed that over-reliance on exit polls which were \"badly flawed\" had been disastrous. Speaking on a live link from Atlanta, CNN president of international networks Eason Jordan said that an inquest was taking place as to how the error was made, and added that CNN would be testifying before a congressional hearing. Mr Jordan admitted that CNN had \"a lot of egg on our faces\". \"CNN made the call and we have to be held accountable for that.\" He said the incident had called for a reappraisal of news values in election coverage. \"The real value of being first and getting it wrong is not good,\" he added.",

His answer was public spending, which is why the government took such a long time to respond. </p> <p>But there is another reason why urban renaissance will always be more difficult to effect in this country: we are \"old\" in the sense that a large proportion of infrastructure, especially housing, was built a long time ago and, despite the best efforts of Herr Goering and the Luftwaffe, is still standing. </p> <p>London housing is seriously dated compared to England at large, all those suburban drives in Pinner built when Stanley Baldwin was prime minister and, still striding across Streatham, nearly a quarter of the stock belongs to the era of Victoria and her son. The east of England is much newer by comparison but even there, in Norwich, Ipswich and the villages there is a substantial pre-1900 heritage. </p> <p>Older homes cost more to maintain and that is one reason why a new Joseph Rowntree Foundation report* says nearly a third of all dwellings in England urgently need at least \u00a31,000 spent on them. In Scotland things are worse, a third of dwellings need \u00a33,000 of repairs. In Wales, where one in 25 dwellings needs more than \u00a35,000 worth of urgent repairs, the problem is one of unfitness: one home in 12 lacks something as fundamental as hygienic means of preparing food - a proper kitchen. </p> <p>Unfitness, not surprisingly, is most evident in 19th century terraces and conversions - detached dwellings in Northern Ireland - and in property left vacant. One reason why you can buy up streets in the Rhondda for the price of a Kensington broom cupboard is that they were jerry-built then and have not enjoyed much investment since. </p> <p>Housing's glory days as a policy priority - remember Harold Macmillan staking his name on building 300,000 homes a year - are long gone. The very phrase slum clearance speaks of a bygone era; only about 1,000 houses are knocked down each year as a matter of public policy compared with 80,000 in the early 70s. With right to buy, housing became privatised and the trend continues as council estates are transferred to autonomous not-for-profit trusts and associations, some of them with sharp commercial instincts. On what they still have councils proportionately spend a lot more than owner occupiers or private landlords. </p> <p>It is, however, private owners who have the key to our \"crumbling castles\". They often have neither the means nor the will to maintain their property. They may miss more complex technical problems or delay too long; research shows widespread misapprehension about likely costs. </p> <p>People rarely seek the help of architects or structural engineers on repairs possibly because they would bring more problems to their attention; they rely instead on \"informal repair diagnosis\" by themselves, relatives, friends, contacts in the building trade, or Bill the bodger. Bill, researchers note, has an obvious conflict of interest if he is also asked to provide a quotation. </p> <p>The psychology of house purchase is puzzling: many buy without a detailed survey and most owners have no long-term maintenance plan or any specific financial provision for future repair costs. Recent movers and others without a network of contacts are most likely to have problems finding a builder. Few people regularly check for repair problems, most just respond when the roof leaks or the ceiling falls in. </p> <p>None the less home owners spend a huge amount - over \u00a335bn a year - on DIY and builders. (Tenants, inevitably, are disinclined to spend). That is at least \u00a3354 per household per year, But do you include paint and light fittings in \"repair\"; does a new phone socket count towards enhancing a property's life? </p> <p>We know poor owner-occupiers live in the worst conditions. More than one in 10 households with an income below \u00a34,000 live in unfit dwellings; they are mainly older people, often women by themselves and young people setting up on their own. For households with \u00a324,000 coming in each year the figure is one in 24. </p> <p>Home owners can still get improvement grants, but only about 35,000 a year are now given out - half to elderly people - compared with 300,000 in the early 80s before the Tory pruning. Oddly, grant levels dropped much less elsewhere in the UK: it is a lot easier to get grants in Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast than in London. Shetland with the Orkneys are the most generous areas. </p> <p>Improvement comes in many forms - councils have been providing more help to adapt buildings for people with disabilities. Local authorities still operate area renewal where whole streets are scheduled - the most recent count showed 160,000 dwellings in such areas, mainly in the north and Midlands. </p> <p>Experts are unsure about the long-run outlook. When does extensive disrepair make a house uninhabitable or fit only for demolition? There is, we know, no causal relationship between house price and house condition, especially in London. Disrepair is an instance of market failure. That is to say, the market would work better if a lot of old and poor people could be put out on the streets and their homes flattened or sold to developers. </p> <p> *Housing conditions in 2000 <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk\">www.jrf.org.uk</a> Kerry Revell and Philip Leather, The state of UK housing, Policy Press, <a href=\"mailto:direct.orders@marston.co.uk\">direct.orders@marston.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.richardrogers.co.uk\">Richard Rogers Partnership</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.regeneration.detr.gov.uk\">DETR regeneration homepage</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.detr.gov.uk/regeneration/utf\">DETR's Urban Task Force</a></p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:david.walker@theguardian.com\">david.walker@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Few people regularly check for repair problems, most just respond when the roof leaks or the ceiling falls in. None the less home owners spend a huge amount - over \u00a335bn a year - on DIY and builders. (Tenants, inevitably, are disinclined to spend). That is at least \u00a3354 per household per year, But do you include paint and light fittings in \"repair\"; does a new phone socket count towards enhancing a property's life? We know poor owner-occupiers live in the worst conditions. More than one in 10 households with an income below \u00a34,000 live in unfit dwellings; they are mainly older people, often women by themselves and young people setting up on their own. For households with \u00a324,000 coming in each year the figure is one in 24. Home owners can still get improvement grants, but only about 35,000 a year are now given out - half to elderly people - compared with 300,000 in the early 80s before the Tory pruning. Oddly, grant levels dropped much less elsewhere in the UK: it is a lot easier to get grants in Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast than in London. Shetland with the Orkneys are the most generous areas. Improvement comes in many forms - councils have been providing more help to adapt buildings for people with disabilities. Local authorities still operate area renewal where whole streets are scheduled - the most recent count showed 160,000 dwellings in such areas, mainly in the north and Midlands. Experts are unsure about the long-run outlook. When does extensive disrepair make a house uninhabitable or fit only for demolition? There is, we know, no causal relationship between house price and house condition, especially in London. Disrepair is an instance of market failure. That is to say, the market would work better if a lot of old and poor people could be put out on the streets and their homes flattened or sold to developers. *Housing conditions in 2000 www.jrf.org.uk Kerry Revell and Philip Leather, The state of UK housing, Policy Press, direct.orders@marston.co.uk Useful links Richard Rogers Partnership DETR regeneration homepage DETR's Urban Task Force david.walker@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The London borough of Hackney may be forced to cede control of more of its education responsibilities to schools or the private sector after an Ofsted report said the council's services were in a \"deeply depressing\" state. Education secretary David Blunkett is discussing two possible solutions with the council. Either schools could be allowed to buy more services or areas such as building services could be taken over by private companies or better performing local education authorities. The borough has already been forced to outsource its school improvement and ethnic minority support services. The government has insisted that this latest privatisation threat is not the first step towards a large-scale outsourcing of the borough's failing services. A spokesman for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) said ministers were seeking a \"mixed solution\" to the problems faced by Hackney's weakest services, which include its financial management, housing benefit, refuse collection and street cleaning. This could involve public and private partnerships being set up to administer failing services and will certainly mean greater involvement of the private and voluntary sectors. The spokesman said the government is keeping its options open and is preparing to send consultants to the borough who will support Hackney staff and examine the future of their services. \"The consultants will be in very soon and working in individual services across the board, but the key message here is that it's not a privatisation agenda\" the spokesman said. The borough will not be forced to externalise its finance department but the government will be offering support including extra personnel to finance officers. The borough's housing benefit contract with private sector firm ITnet has collapsed, but the DETR says it does not want to see services brought fully back in house. Hackney is running a backlog of 17,000 housing benefit applications. Refuse collection and street cleaning have already been outsourced but on an unusually short 18-month contract, giving the borough time to examine its options. Relevant government departments and the Audit Commission will meet with representatives from Hackney next week to discuss how the council can meet the milestones set out in the commission's best value inspection report, released last week. These include gaining a realistic picture of the council's deficit, which could total up to \u00a340m and agreeing a balanced budget for the next financial year by February 2001.",

This blacklisting will be serious for the departments involved, cutting them off from the board's funding of postgraduate students but it is the price of taking arts and humanities research seriously. The upside is the chance of more money for departments that do perform well. </p> <p>True, the board's \u00a352m budget is puny compared with the big science research councils' but in two years of existence under the leadership of Paul Langford it has established itself firmly on the scene, raising the profile of this kind of research and raising the morale of academics, believes the new chief executive David Eastwood. </p> <p> He and his heavily oversubscribed budget are now in the sights of about 12,000 staff and researchers in the arts and humanities. An Oxford historian like Langford, Eastwood even shares the same specialism of 18th and early 19th century English history (perhaps a thorough grounding in the intricacies of patronage and politics is deemed essential to dispensing grants?) He says he has three rules in life - never draw up a seating plan (he was a senior tutor at an Oxford college), never choose a menu and never follow someone who has done a really good job. \"I have broken that spectacularly following Paul,\" he smiles. He comes to the job from Swansea where he has been head of the history department and pro-vice chancellor. </p> <p>The board - chaired by Sir Brian Follett, the retiring vice-chancellor of Warwick University - is to become a company limited by guarantee from April 1 - at present it is not a legal entity - it doesn't employ its own staff or have a bank account. In the new year Eastwood will unveil an innovation fund which he hopes will foster the equivalent of blue skies research in the sciences. He is thinking not only of international collaboration, but interdisciplinary work between, for instance, cultural and environmental fields. (He is discussing joint funding with the Natural Environment Research Council.) \"We want new ways of researching new forms of knowledge. We want something that will make people sit up.\" </p> <p>The board will also consider bids for another five or six research centres to add to the 10 existing ones. This continues the policy of promoting collaboration and research teams in the arts and humanities - for so long the preserve of the lone scholar - on the model of the sciences, although Eastwood insists the lone scholar is still catered for in the board's research leave scheme. </p> <p>He is also committed to continuing the fight for the arts as well as the humanities.

      "bodyText": "You know who you are..the Arts and Humanities Research Board is about to publish the list of departments where PhD completion rates have fallen below 50 per cent. This blacklisting will be serious for the departments involved, cutting them off from the board's funding of postgraduate students but it is the price of taking arts and humanities research seriously. The upside is the chance of more money for departments that do perform well. True, the board's \u00a352m budget is puny compared with the big science research councils' but in two years of existence under the leadership of Paul Langford it has established itself firmly on the scene, raising the profile of this kind of research and raising the morale of academics, believes the new chief executive David Eastwood. He and his heavily oversubscribed budget are now in the sights of about 12,000 staff and researchers in the arts and humanities. An Oxford historian like Langford, Eastwood even shares the same specialism of 18th and early 19th century English history (perhaps a thorough grounding in the intricacies of patronage and politics is deemed essential to dispensing grants?) He says he has three rules in life - never draw up a seating plan (he was a senior tutor at an Oxford college), never choose a menu and never follow someone who has done a really good job. \"I have broken that spectacularly following Paul,\" he smiles. He comes to the job from Swansea where he has been head of the history department and pro-vice chancellor. The board - chaired by Sir Brian Follett, the retiring vice-chancellor of Warwick University - is to become a company limited by guarantee from April 1 - at present it is not a legal entity - it doesn't employ its own staff or have a bank account. In the new year Eastwood will unveil an innovation fund which he hopes will foster the equivalent of blue skies research in the sciences. He is thinking not only of international collaboration, but interdisciplinary work between, for instance, cultural and environmental fields. (He is discussing joint funding with the Natural Environment Research Council.) \"We want new ways of researching new forms of knowledge. We want something that will make people sit up.\" The board will also consider bids for another five or six research centres to add to the 10 existing ones. This continues the policy of promoting collaboration and research teams in the arts and humanities - for so long the preserve of the lone scholar - on the model of the sciences, although Eastwood insists the lone scholar is still catered for in the board's research leave scheme. He is also committed to continuing the fight for the arts as well as the humanities. Widespread scepticism, if not downright hostility, to the whole idea of arts research had to be confronted by the board as it established itself. How do you research a performance? Was this \"flaky arts stuff\" serious research? Eastwood argues that arts research is like engineering which investigates processes. The arts are a major, and growing, contributor to the UK economy \"I think if you put some of our creative and performing arts and design people in a synergistic relationship not just with the humanities but with other parts of the research domain all sorts of interesting things will come out of it.\" In the longer term he wants to see the board become a fully-fledged research council. \"We should be a research council because it gives our subject domain parity of esteem and a seat at every table as of right.\" Status and money for the arts and humanities are linked, he believes - not that they will ever command the sums going to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. \"We are perceived as a research council in all but name.

Mr Woodhead, who leaves his job in two weeks' time, said that he \"felt a sense of failure\" at failing to persuade the government earlier that Hackney needed \"radical intervention\". \"The authority is doing a considerable number of things wrong. It is failing to implement a schools improvement strategy, it has failed to monitor and support and intervene appropriately with schools, it has failed to support school management. There is a failure of leadership from elected members, a failure to target resources on priorities,\" he said. Jules Pipe, leader of the beleaguered council, admitted to the Today programme that the lack of overall control by any party for four years had led to \"chaos and a lack of political leadership\". Hackney is one of England's poorest boroughs and Ofsted inspectors have visited its schools three times in the past three years. Useful links Ofsted Hackney Education Nord Anglia",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>HAIR AND HARTSON</strong> <br></p> <p>It's difficult to know which has depreciated faster in recent months: John Hartson's hairline or his value. Back in March, Big John resembled a modern day Henry VIII: rather rotund, rather hairy and rather desperate to score. \"Come to Spurs in a \u00a37m deal then,\" cried Arsenal's George Graham, the Tottenham manager, only for a pesky injury to get in the way of John's destiny. Then, in August, history repeated itself, but with strangely diminishing returns. Hartson's hair was now thinner, and so was the Pope's Rangers \u00a35.5m offer! Scientists the world over might have scoffed, but the eagle-eyed Fiver knew a correlation when it saw one. It was obvious: the less hair John had, the less clubs were prepared to bid for him. </p> <p>So when our source at Selhurst Park told us yesterday that Big John was combing his hair over, a la Bobby Charlton circa 1965, we knew it was just a matter of time before some club offered a lowly sum - perhaps \u00a34m (plus Kevin Lisbie) - for him. And surprise, surprise, that's exactly what Charlton did today. However before we telephone Frank Leboeuf to warn him to pack his shoulder pads for tomorrow's game, up popped the Addicks' manager Frank \"Alan Curbishley\" Warren to claim the deal was far from done.</p> <p>\"I have had a couple of conversations with Terry and obviously we know each other well,\" Curbishley waffled, before finally getting to some sort of point, \"He asked after young Kevin and I told him we had lots of injury problems with our strikers. I said if you want Kevin I will take John.\" So why isn't the deal complete? According to Curbishley, he only made a tentative enquiry, so there is still much work to do. \"I'm a bit surprised this has come out - I haven't even mentioned it to Kevin,\" he continued sheepishly. \"I spoke to Terry and that's how it was left. Something needs to be done now that it is out in the open,\" he added non-commitally - realising, no doubt, that if waits just a bit longer, Hartson's hair loss will surely bring the price down even further.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>CUP FEVERISH</strong> <br></p> <p>It starts quietly, with the odd down-page story on a club from the Screwfix Direct League. Then 'On The Ball' reports on an oddball club from the Bloxwich Combination. But by January you will not be able to stomach another story about window cleaners who refuse to be daunted by murky prospects, milkmen who have lots of bottle and computer programmers who have all the answers. Yep it's that time of year again: when the Cup clich\u00e9s pour out in an unstoppable stream. </p> <p>So well done to all 34 non-League clubs who have got to the first round. And we promise not to call you \"brave\" just because you dare to turn up at a Third Division ground, or \"romantic\" just because you did not kick your way through the qualifying rounds, or \"modest\" just because you are so non-League you play in the Conference. </p> <p>Instead, we salute clubs like Barrow, who boast a squad that can call on more than 1,000 League games' worth of experience - while gently pointing out that if you can find any romance in these bunch of old pros then you are even sicker than you realised. And we also take our hats off to Radcliffe Borough, who play York City at Gigg Lane. Bernard Manning is their club president and his son is the chairman. Modesty is not quite the first word you would associate with Bernard. And as for romance well, you really are sick.</p> <p>Beware of this line: \"Even if Borough lose, they'll be laughing.\" And here's a few more you should watch out for: \"When we go to big clubs our lads raise their game and I'm sure Bracknell will do the same\", \"We would be silly not to show them some respect\" and, yes, \"It's an FA Cup final for them\".

      "body": "<p> I saw a film today, oh boy ... </p> <p>- The Beatles</p> <p> While enthusiasts and detractors will continue to empty entire dictionaries attempting to describe or deride it, \"authenticity\" still remains the word most likely to stir a debate. In fact, this leading obsession-to validate or invalidate the reels and tapes-invariably brings up a collateral and more general concern: whether or not, with the advent of digital technology, image has forsaken its once unimpeachable hold on the truth. </p> <p> For the most part, skeptics call the whole effort a hoax but grudgingly admit The Navidson Record is a hoax of exceptional quality. Unfortunately out of those who accept its validity many tend to swear allegiance to tabloid-UFO sightings. Clearly it is not easy to appear credible when after vouching for the film's verity, the discourse suddenly switches to why Elvis is still alive and probably wintering in the Florida Keys. One thing remains certain: any controversy surrounding Billy Meyer's film on flying saucers has been supplanted by the house on Ash Tree Lane. </p> <p> Though many continue to devote substantial time and energy to the antinomies of fact or fiction, representation or artifice, document or prank, as of late the more interesting material dwells exclusively on the interpretation of events within the film. This direction seems more promising, even if the house itself, like Melville's behemoth, remains resistant to summation. </p> <p> Much like its subject, The Navidson Record itself is also uneasily contained - whether by category or lection. If finally catalogued as a gothic tale, contemporary urban folkmyth, or merely a ghost story, as some have called it, the documentary will still, sooner or later, slip the limits of any one of those genres. Too many important things in The Navidson Record jut out past the borders. Where one might expect horror, the supernatural, or traditional paroxysms of dread and fear, one discovers disturbing sadness, a sequence on radioactive isotopes, or even laughter over a Simpsons episode. </p> <p> In the 17th century, England's greatest topographer of worlds satanic and divine warned that hell was nothing less than \"Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace/ And rest can never dwell, hope never comes/ That comes to all\" thus echoing the words copied down by hell's most famous tourist: \"Dinanzi a me non fuor cose create/ Se non etterne, e io etterna duro./ Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate.\" </p> <p> Even today many people still feel The Navidson Record, in spite of all its existential refinements and contemporary allusions, continues to reflect those exact sentiments. In fact a few eager intellectuals have already begun to treat the film as a warning in and of itself, perfectly suited for hanging whole above the gates of such schools as Architectonics, Popomo, Consequentialism, Neo-Plasticism, Phenomenology, Information Theory, Marxism, Biosemiotics, to say nothing of psychology, medicine, New Age spirituality, art and even Neo-Minimalism. Will Navidson, however, remains stalwart in his insistence that his documentary should be taken literally. As he himself says, \"... all this, don't take it as anything else but this. And if one day you find yourself passing by that house don't stop, don't slow down, just keep going. There's nothing there. Beware.\" </p> <p> Considering how the film ends, it is not surprising that more than a handful of people have decided to heed his advice. </p> <p> The Navidson Record did not first appear as it does today. Nearly seven years ago what surfaced was \"The Five and a Half Minute Hallway\" - a five and a half minute optical illusion barely exceeding the abilities of any NYU film school graduate. The problem, of course, was the accompanying statement that claimed all of it was true. </p> <p> In one continuous shot, Navidson, whom we never actually see, momentarily focuses on a doorway on the north wall of his living room before climbing outside of the house through a window to the east of that door, where he trips slightly in the flower bed, redirects the camera from the ground to the exterior white clapboard, then moves right, crawling back inside the house through a second window, this time to the west of that door, where we hear him grunt slightly as he knocks his head on the sill, eliciting light laughter from those in the room, presumably Karen, his brother Tom, and his friend Billy Reston - though like Navidson, they too never appear on camera-before finally returning us to the starting point, thus completely circling the doorway and so proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that insulation or siding is the only possible thing this doorway could lead to, which is when all laughter stops, as Navidson's hand appears in frame and pulls open the door, revealing a narrow black hallway at least ten feet long, prompting Navidson to re-investigate, once again leading us on another circumambulation of this strange passageway, climbing in and out of the windows, pointing the camera to where the hallway should extend but finding nothing more than his own backyard-no ten foot protuberance, just rose bushes, a muddy dart gun, and the translucent summer air - in essence an exercise in disbelief which despite his best intentions still takes Navidson back inside to that impossible hallway, until as the camera begins to move closer, threatening this time to actually enter it, Karen snaps, \"Don't you dare go in there again, Navy,\" to which Tom adds, \"Yeah, not such a hot idea,\" thus arresting Navidson at the threshold, though he still puts his hand inside, finally retracting and inspecting it, as if by seeing alone there might be something more to feel, Reston wanting to know if in fact his friend does sense something different, and Navidson providing the matter-of-fact answer which also serves as the conclusion, however abrupt, to this bizarre short: \"It's freezing in there.\" </p> <p> Dissemination of \"The Five and a Half Minute Hallway\" seemed driven by curiosity alone. No one ever officially distributed it and so it never appeared in film festivals or commercial film circles. Rather, VHS copies were passed around by hand, a series of progressively degenerating dubs of a home video revealing a truly bizarre house with notably very few details about the owners or for that matter the author of the piece. </p> <p> Less than a year later another short surfaced. It was even more hotly sought after than \"The Five and a Half Minute Hallway\" and resulted in some fervent quests for Navidson and the house itself, all of which, for one reason or another, failed. Unlike the first, this short was not a continuous shot, prompting many to speculate that the eight minutes making up \"Exploration #4\" were in fact bits of a much larger whole. </p> <p> The structure of \"Exploration #4\" is highly discontinuous, jarring, and as evidenced by many poor edits, even hurried.

      "bodyText": "I saw a film today, oh boy ... - The Beatles While enthusiasts and detractors will continue to empty entire dictionaries attempting to describe or deride it, \"authenticity\" still remains the word most likely to stir a debate. In fact, this leading obsession-to validate or invalidate the reels and tapes-invariably brings up a collateral and more general concern: whether or not, with the advent of digital technology, image has forsaken its once unimpeachable hold on the truth. For the most part, skeptics call the whole effort a hoax but grudgingly admit The Navidson Record is a hoax of exceptional quality. Unfortunately out of those who accept its validity many tend to swear allegiance to tabloid-UFO sightings. Clearly it is not easy to appear credible when after vouching for the film's verity, the discourse suddenly switches to why Elvis is still alive and probably wintering in the Florida Keys. One thing remains certain: any controversy surrounding Billy Meyer's film on flying saucers has been supplanted by the house on Ash Tree Lane. Though many continue to devote substantial time and energy to the antinomies of fact or fiction, representation or artifice, document or prank, as of late the more interesting material dwells exclusively on the interpretation of events within the film. This direction seems more promising, even if the house itself, like Melville's behemoth, remains resistant to summation. Much like its subject, The Navidson Record itself is also uneasily contained - whether by category or lection. If finally catalogued as a gothic tale, contemporary urban folkmyth, or merely a ghost story, as some have called it, the documentary will still, sooner or later, slip the limits of any one of those genres. Too many important things in The Navidson Record jut out past the borders. Where one might expect horror, the supernatural, or traditional paroxysms of dread and fear, one discovers disturbing sadness, a sequence on radioactive isotopes, or even laughter over a Simpsons episode. In the 17th century, England's greatest topographer of worlds satanic and divine warned that hell was nothing less than \"Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace/ And rest can never dwell, hope never comes/ That comes to all\" thus echoing the words copied down by hell's most famous tourist: \"Dinanzi a me non fuor cose create/ Se non etterne, e io etterna duro./ Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate.\" Even today many people still feel The Navidson Record, in spite of all its existential refinements and contemporary allusions, continues to reflect those exact sentiments. In fact a few eager intellectuals have already begun to treat the film as a warning in and of itself, perfectly suited for hanging whole above the gates of such schools as Architectonics, Popomo, Consequentialism, Neo-Plasticism, Phenomenology, Information Theory, Marxism, Biosemiotics, to say nothing of psychology, medicine, New Age spirituality, art and even Neo-Minimalism. Will Navidson, however, remains stalwart in his insistence that his documentary should be taken literally. As he himself says, \"... all this, don't take it as anything else but this. And if one day you find yourself passing by that house don't stop, don't slow down, just keep going. There's nothing there. Beware.\" Considering how the film ends, it is not surprising that more than a handful of people have decided to heed his advice. The Navidson Record did not first appear as it does today. Nearly seven years ago what surfaced was \"The Five and a Half Minute Hallway\" - a five and a half minute optical illusion barely exceeding the abilities of any NYU film school graduate. The problem, of course, was the accompanying statement that claimed all of it was true. In one continuous shot, Navidson, whom we never actually see, momentarily focuses on a doorway on the north wall of his living room before climbing outside of the house through a window to the east of that door, where he trips slightly in the flower bed, redirects the camera from the ground to the exterior white clapboard, then moves right, crawling back inside the house through a second window, this time to the west of that door, where we hear him grunt slightly as he knocks his head on the sill, eliciting light laughter from those in the room, presumably Karen, his brother Tom, and his friend Billy Reston - though like Navidson, they too never appear on camera-before finally returning us to the starting point, thus completely circling the doorway and so proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that insulation or siding is the only possible thing this doorway could lead to, which is when all laughter stops, as Navidson's hand appears in frame and pulls open the door, revealing a narrow black hallway at least ten feet long, prompting Navidson to re-investigate, once again leading us on another circumambulation of this strange passageway, climbing in and out of the windows, pointing the camera to where the hallway should extend but finding nothing more than his own backyard-no ten foot protuberance, just rose bushes, a muddy dart gun, and the translucent summer air - in essence an exercise in disbelief which despite his best intentions still takes Navidson back inside to that impossible hallway, until as the camera begins to move closer, threatening this time to actually enter it, Karen snaps, \"Don't you dare go in there again, Navy,\" to which Tom adds, \"Yeah, not such a hot idea,\" thus arresting Navidson at the threshold, though he still puts his hand inside, finally retracting and inspecting it, as if by seeing alone there might be something more to feel, Reston wanting to know if in fact his friend does sense something different, and Navidson providing the matter-of-fact answer which also serves as the conclusion, however abrupt, to this bizarre short: \"It's freezing in there.\" Dissemination of \"The Five and a Half Minute Hallway\" seemed driven by curiosity alone. No one ever officially distributed it and so it never appeared in film festivals or commercial film circles. Rather, VHS copies were passed around by hand, a series of progressively degenerating dubs of a home video revealing a truly bizarre house with notably very few details about the owners or for that matter the author of the piece. Less than a year later another short surfaced. It was even more hotly sought after than \"The Five and a Half Minute Hallway\" and resulted in some fervent quests for Navidson and the house itself, all of which, for one reason or another, failed. Unlike the first, this short was not a continuous shot, prompting many to speculate that the eight minutes making up \"Exploration #4\" were in fact bits of a much larger whole. The structure of \"Exploration #4\" is highly discontinuous, jarring, and as evidenced by many poor edits, even hurried. The first shot catches Navidson mid-phrase. He is tired, depressed and pale. \"- days, I think. And, I ... I don't know.\" [Drink of something; unclear what.] \"Actually I'd like to burn it down. Can't think clearly enough to do it though.\" [Laughs] \"And now ... this.\" The next shot jumps to Karen and Tom arguing over whether or not to \"go in after him.\" At this point it remains unclear to whom they are referring. There are several more shots. Trees in winter. Blood on the kitchen floor. One shot of a child (Daisy) crying. Then back to Navidson: \"Nothing but this tape which I've seen enough times, it's more like a memory than anything else. And I still don't know: was he right or just out of his mind?\" Followed by three more shots. Dark hallways. Windowless rooms. Stairs. Then a new voice: \"I'm lost. Out of food. Low on water. No sense of direction. Oh god ...\" The speaker is a bearded, broad shouldered man with frantic eyes. He speaks rapidly and appears short of breath: \"Holloway Roberts. Born in Menomonie, Wisconsin. Bachelor's from U. Mass. There's something here. It's following me. No, it's stalking me. I've been stalked by it for days but for some reason it's not attacking. It's waiting, waiting for something. I don't know what. Holloway Roberts. Menomonie, Wisconsin. I'm not alone here. I'm not alone.\" Thus bringing to an end this strange abstract which as the release of The Navidson Record revealed was sparingly incomplete. Then for two years nothing.

That re-appraisal is now almost complete and the results will be known next week. Anyone reading your finance notebook comment would gain the impression that the board's decision to increase the transparency of our processes was done on the spur of the moment. In reality, it followed many months of discussions with the groups that represent patients, professionals and the healthcare industries. Nice values the close working relationship it has with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our methodology has evolved over a two-year period of consultation and discussion that included the industry and took into account UK and European legislation. The NHS is a customer of the pharmaceutical-industry, but works on behalf of the patients and the public, and it must bring a rationale to the use of its resources. The NHS in England and Wales has asked Nice to provide this rationale in order that patients have the highest attainable standards of care within the resources available. \u0095 Professor Sir Michael Rawlins is chair of the national institute for clinical excellence Feedback: what do you think?

The military are back in power again, the economy is sinking and Islamabad is internationally criticised for its support of the militants in Kashmir and the hardline Taliban in Afghanistan.</p> <p>But General Pervez Musharraf, the quietly spoken army chief who seized power in a coup in October last year, has a plan. Unafraid of the effect it might have on his country's international image, he wants Pakistan to become a major arms dealer.</p> <p>The pride of Pakistan's state-owned defence equipment manufacturers, from missiles to tanks to artillery shells, is now on display at one of the world 's largest arms shows, the \"Arms for Peace\" exhibition in Karachi.</p> <p>\"There is big money in defence and we need to enter into areas where developed countries are not competing,\" said Gen Musharraf, as he toured the exhibition.</p> <p>\"Pakistan offers a poor man's option to obtaining weapons in a cheap and economical manner. This will generate economic activity in Pakistan and we will plan more such ventures in the near future.\"</p> <p>In recent years Pakistan has been a major defence importer, buying Agosta 90B submarines from France and Sea King helicopters from Britain.</p> <p>Now the military regime hopes to become a competitive arms dealer itself. Exports of machine guns, rifles, anti-tank rockets, mortars and ammunition earned $30.2m (\u00a321.7m) last year.</p> <p>First Pakistan will put into mass production its new Al-Khalid tank, which is armed with a 125mm smooth bore gun and equipped with auto-tracking and thermal imaging.</p> <p>\"We are indeed proud of this tank. Inshallah (God willing) it will be the main tank of the Pakistan Army,\" said Gen Musharraf.</p> <p>15 Al-Khalid tanks are now being built in a pilot project with China and mass production is scheduled to begin next year.</p> <p>Until now Pakistan has preferred to upgrade older tank designs, like the T-59 which has been modernised into the Al-Zarrar, rather than take on the expense and expertise needed to produce a new tank.</p> <p>Gen Musharraf wants the Al-Khalid to be a direct rival to the Russian T-90S tank.

      "bodyText": "Pakistan is a troubled country. The military are back in power again, the economy is sinking and Islamabad is internationally criticised for its support of the militants in Kashmir and the hardline Taliban in Afghanistan. But General Pervez Musharraf, the quietly spoken army chief who seized power in a coup in October last year, has a plan. Unafraid of the effect it might have on his country's international image, he wants Pakistan to become a major arms dealer. The pride of Pakistan's state-owned defence equipment manufacturers, from missiles to tanks to artillery shells, is now on display at one of the world 's largest arms shows, the \"Arms for Peace\" exhibition in Karachi. \"There is big money in defence and we need to enter into areas where developed countries are not competing,\" said Gen Musharraf, as he toured the exhibition. \"Pakistan offers a poor man's option to obtaining weapons in a cheap and economical manner. This will generate economic activity in Pakistan and we will plan more such ventures in the near future.\" In recent years Pakistan has been a major defence importer, buying Agosta 90B submarines from France and Sea King helicopters from Britain. Now the military regime hopes to become a competitive arms dealer itself. Exports of machine guns, rifles, anti-tank rockets, mortars and ammunition earned $30.2m (\u00a321.7m) last year. First Pakistan will put into mass production its new Al-Khalid tank, which is armed with a 125mm smooth bore gun and equipped with auto-tracking and thermal imaging. \"We are indeed proud of this tank. Inshallah (God willing) it will be the main tank of the Pakistan Army,\" said Gen Musharraf. 15 Al-Khalid tanks are now being built in a pilot project with China and mass production is scheduled to begin next year. Until now Pakistan has preferred to upgrade older tank designs, like the T-59 which has been modernised into the Al-Zarrar, rather than take on the expense and expertise needed to produce a new tank. Gen Musharraf wants the Al-Khalid to be a direct rival to the Russian T-90S tank. Last month Russian President Vladimir Putin clinched a deal to sell T-90S tanks and Su-30 MKI fighter jets to India, Pakistan's archrival. Islamabad will also set up a Defence Export and Exhibition Directorate in Rawalpindi, where the army has its main base, to show off defence equipment. \"We will soon expand our defence sales and exports appreciably,\" Gen Musharraf said. His generals are negotiating the possible sale of their Super Mushak trainer aircraft to an unnamed Middle Eastern country and Agosta-90B submarines to Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Pakistan bought three of the submarines from France under a technology transfer agreement. The generals say that apart from India and perhaps Israel they have no qualms about selling weapons to any nation. Islamabad is hoping to target allies in the Middle East and poorer nations in Africa and south-east Asia. At least 34 countries with a combined defence purchase budget of $20bn (\u00a314.3bn) sent delegations to the arms fair, including Zimbabwe, Rwanda, the Palestinian Authority, Indonesia and Malaysia. Gen Musharraf is also hoping to use the skills of some of Pakistan's more traditional weapons manufacturers in his new endeavour. Since the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan 20 years ago, Pakistan has been awash with unlicensed weapons from Kalashnikov assault rifles to rockets and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. Cheaper copies of these weapons pour out of Darra Adam Khel in the lawless tribal areas of northern Pakistan, one of the largest unofficial arms markets in Asia. In an attempt to tackle the daily shootings and regular bomb blasts that plague Pakistani society, the military want to regulate the Darra market, limit gun sales and hire the best gun makers to work for the state-owned defence industries. For now the regime is meeting tough resistance from Darra and the tribal elders. But if he succeeds, Gen Musharraf will have found a unique way to improve security in Pakistan and at the same time bolster his troubled nation's sickly economy.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is planning a major reorganisation of its communications department in a move that will result in \"a small number\" of job losses. The shake-up, which is being announced to staff today, will affect some 160 members of staff. The BBC said that some staff whose jobs will disappear as a result of the restructure would be offered new positions in the department. New head of publicity Vanda Rumney described the restructure as \"a sensible adjustment to support the new structure of the BBC\". She added: \"It will affect everyone in as much as we're now asking everyone to work cross-channel and cross-media. \"Whereas before people were working on BBC1 and BBC2 they will now work across many more channels as well as BBC Online.\" The restructure will see the head of publicity for BBC1 take on additional responsibilities for drama, entertainment and sports. And the head of publicity for BBC2 will take on BBC Online and factual programming. BBC3, the BBC's new digital channel devoted to the youth market, will share a publicity manager with Radio 1. BBC4, a remodelled BBC Knowledge, will be put together with another BBC division. And there will also be a publicity manager dedicated to BBC News. Ms Rumney said most of the new jobs would be filled by internal candidates, but that headhunters had been briefed to look for a new head of publicity for BBC1, formerly part of her remit. The corporation will also set up a new strategic unit under head of corporate public relations Andrew Whyte to focus on long-term planning. Sally Osman was this week named head of communications at the BBC as part of a shake-up instigated by the outgoing director of marketing and communications Matthew Bannister. Jenny Secombe, who is leaving as BBC head of entertainment publicity, said: \"I have had a very happy 15 years at the BBC and my time heading up entertainment publicity has been the highlight of my career to date.

      "body": "<p>Armani is doing it, Versace is doing it, Chanel, Dior and Moschino are doing it, which means that pretty soon you will be too. Welcome back to the wonderful world of matching accessories. And no, that doesn't mean match as in the same colour or picked to look good together. It means match, as in cut from the same cloth. As in having to do some serious shopping to replace all the shoes, bags and belts you can't wear anymore because they aren't part of a set. </p> <p>For most women, the prospect of matching accessories holds about as much appeal as wearing whale-bone corsets and up until now has been about as cool. As a trend it is rigid, contrived and a royal pain to achieve. And who really wants to walk down the street looking like the kind of person who expends mental energy on getting their bits and pieces colour-coded? As a personality trait, it is up there with the alphabetised CD collection and ironed underpants. </p> <p>But the thing is, it does make sense. If this season is all about looking perfectly put together you are not going to be able to make a look work by accessorising with one-off impulse buys and flea-market finds. No (in the minds of the designers, at least) there will be no more falling out of bed and into the nearest piece of distressed denim. It is groomed and glossy all the way, which means looking as if every inch of your outfit has been planned days in advance. Hazel Curry, buying manager for women's designer wear at Selfridges, London, agrees: \"Everyone has heard about lady-like chic and the return of sophisticated tailoring and separates. Luxurious looks are often over the top while bourgeois opulence is key.\" </p> <p>If you think that the only people who have the time for such close attention to detail are those ladies who lunch, and perhaps your mother or grandmother, you would be right. And guess where designers have been looking for inspiration? Forties and fifties-inspired tailored suits are on the must-have list, as are super deluxe, jet-set looks. It means looking fabulous from head to foot. Coco Chan, contemporary designer collections buyer at Harvey Nichols, thinks we will eventually learn to love matching accessories: \"It's an important look. People enjoy looking co-ordinated and put together and if it doesn't reflect the person inside it certainly makes you feel together.\" </p> <p>You may have spotted this trend coming. Think of the legions of girls-about-town in their wall-to-wall Louis Vuitton, or of Kate Moss and her supermodel chums sporting bags, belts and shoes of shiny, shimmery gold and diamante. Accessories have been making a statement for the last few seasons, to the extent that the finishing touches became more important than the outfit itself. Fendi baguettes, pashminas, Prada shoes, Burberry anything, all made a big fashion splash, and not one constituted what you might describe as a proper item of clothing. Since the world went designer-logo crazy last spring it has got worse. As Curry says: \"I am now finding more demand than ever for accessories in the Selfridges fashion departments. The most obvious is Burberry, but even designers such as Helmut Lang or Alessandro dell'Aqua are producing matching shoe/bag combinations\". </p> <p>So, saving up for the right shoes is no longer enough, unless you can stretch to the right belt and bag. Perhaps that is the key to carrying off the whole look. Fashion editors will use words such as rich, wealthy, glitzy and glam to describe this season's offerings, but it all comes down to one thing: money. Look rich, act rich, be rich. As Hazel Curry points out: \"If you've spent a fortune on this luxe look you want everyone to know about it.\" </p> <p>Matching accessories are the concept made flesh: for every pair of shoes you fancy, you will be taking a bag, belt or scarf home. Clearly, the time and money which has to be invested in matching mean that the look is designed to be worn by people unfamiliar with the concept of a credit limit. So unless you can afford to go for the whole shebang, steer clear or wait until the chains offer good copies. </p> <p>Coco Chan sees a trend: \"It's obvious consumption, harking back to the 80s. Logos and monograms are still very important, as are colours that suggest wealth and richness: camels, winter whites, gold and deep berrytones.\" </p> <p>So will it take off? Giorgio Armani certainly thinks so. His current accessories include court shoes, clutch bags and whippet-thin belts, designed to match. Versace, Dior and Chanel, among others, have followed suit, and made matching accessories a big part of their autumn/winter looks.

      "bodyText": "Armani is doing it, Versace is doing it, Chanel, Dior and Moschino are doing it, which means that pretty soon you will be too. Welcome back to the wonderful world of matching accessories. And no, that doesn't mean match as in the same colour or picked to look good together. It means match, as in cut from the same cloth. As in having to do some serious shopping to replace all the shoes, bags and belts you can't wear anymore because they aren't part of a set. For most women, the prospect of matching accessories holds about as much appeal as wearing whale-bone corsets and up until now has been about as cool. As a trend it is rigid, contrived and a royal pain to achieve. And who really wants to walk down the street looking like the kind of person who expends mental energy on getting their bits and pieces colour-coded? As a personality trait, it is up there with the alphabetised CD collection and ironed underpants. But the thing is, it does make sense. If this season is all about looking perfectly put together you are not going to be able to make a look work by accessorising with one-off impulse buys and flea-market finds. No (in the minds of the designers, at least) there will be no more falling out of bed and into the nearest piece of distressed denim. It is groomed and glossy all the way, which means looking as if every inch of your outfit has been planned days in advance. Hazel Curry, buying manager for women's designer wear at Selfridges, London, agrees: \"Everyone has heard about lady-like chic and the return of sophisticated tailoring and separates. Luxurious looks are often over the top while bourgeois opulence is key.\" If you think that the only people who have the time for such close attention to detail are those ladies who lunch, and perhaps your mother or grandmother, you would be right. And guess where designers have been looking for inspiration? Forties and fifties-inspired tailored suits are on the must-have list, as are super deluxe, jet-set looks. It means looking fabulous from head to foot. Coco Chan, contemporary designer collections buyer at Harvey Nichols, thinks we will eventually learn to love matching accessories: \"It's an important look. People enjoy looking co-ordinated and put together and if it doesn't reflect the person inside it certainly makes you feel together.\" You may have spotted this trend coming. Think of the legions of girls-about-town in their wall-to-wall Louis Vuitton, or of Kate Moss and her supermodel chums sporting bags, belts and shoes of shiny, shimmery gold and diamante. Accessories have been making a statement for the last few seasons, to the extent that the finishing touches became more important than the outfit itself. Fendi baguettes, pashminas, Prada shoes, Burberry anything, all made a big fashion splash, and not one constituted what you might describe as a proper item of clothing. Since the world went designer-logo crazy last spring it has got worse. As Curry says: \"I am now finding more demand than ever for accessories in the Selfridges fashion departments. The most obvious is Burberry, but even designers such as Helmut Lang or Alessandro dell'Aqua are producing matching shoe/bag combinations\". So, saving up for the right shoes is no longer enough, unless you can stretch to the right belt and bag. Perhaps that is the key to carrying off the whole look. Fashion editors will use words such as rich, wealthy, glitzy and glam to describe this season's offerings, but it all comes down to one thing: money. Look rich, act rich, be rich. As Hazel Curry points out: \"If you've spent a fortune on this luxe look you want everyone to know about it.\" Matching accessories are the concept made flesh: for every pair of shoes you fancy, you will be taking a bag, belt or scarf home. Clearly, the time and money which has to be invested in matching mean that the look is designed to be worn by people unfamiliar with the concept of a credit limit. So unless you can afford to go for the whole shebang, steer clear or wait until the chains offer good copies. Coco Chan sees a trend: \"It's obvious consumption, harking back to the 80s. Logos and monograms are still very important, as are colours that suggest wealth and richness: camels, winter whites, gold and deep berrytones.\" So will it take off? Giorgio Armani certainly thinks so. His current accessories include court shoes, clutch bags and whippet-thin belts, designed to match. Versace, Dior and Chanel, among others, have followed suit, and made matching accessories a big part of their autumn/winter looks. It is never going to be especially hip or edgy to follow this fashion edict, because it shows how much you care, and that's not cool. But, strangely, for a look that is so clearly a result of one too many afternoons digging about in the fashion archives, it does feel fresh and modern. Chan says: \"I think we're all tired of running around in little girlie frocks and mules, with flower clips in our hair. It is very satisfying and a boost to the confidence to feel groomed yet womanly.\" Curry thinks the look is going to do well.\"The high street has become so skilled at interpreting the latest looks that it is inevitable that this trend will become mainstream very quickly. Although it is not possible to recreate the logo look with real authenticity, the newer, polished, sleek styles are already being snapped up. I believe women will love the opportunity to become high maintenance.\" But have we really spent the last few months falling in love with gorgeous snakeskin stilettos, just to forsake them now because we are required to have a gorgeous snakeskin belt as well?

A total of \u00a3450m will be dispersed to children's charities, spelled out by the chancellor and David Blunkett at a conference this week. Another day, another scheme - the Tories pour scorn, preparing to axe social programmes they hope no one will notice or understand, to meet their tax-cutting promises at the next election. </p> <p>This \u00a3450m is a hefty sum. It is for preventative projects for 5-13 year-olds, those left out by Sure Start for babies and Connexions for 13-18 year-olds. The list of charity projects includes the National Pyramid Trust, which runs 90 therapeutic Pyramid clubs for emotionally and socially deprived primary children to encourage them in school and avert disaster later. Baby Think Twice in Stevenage sends teenage mothers into schools to warn about what life with an unplanned baby is like. There are homework clubs and schemes for excluded children. Big Brothers and Sisters in Bristol sends young volunteers back into schools to mentor a pupil through exams. The money is for hundreds of good ideas that sprung up from local need, not devised in Whitehall. </p> <p>This is cement filling in the cracks in the great wall of programmes that promise to abolish child poverty in 20 years and halve it in 10. How is the grand plan going? Labour inherited 4m poor children, measured by the EU standard of families living below half average earning. The shocking legacy of the Tory years was one in three children born poor: a third of all the poor children in Europe are born British. </p> <p>So far, Labour has lifted a quarter of them out of poverty, partly through sharply rising employment, mainly through a phenomenal rise in benefits. It is curious how little these increases have entered into the national consciousness. With so much talk about \"a hand-up, not a hand-out\" and \"work is the best welfare\", there has been an assumption that all the money has gone to the \"deserving\" working poor on the working families tax credit and nothing much to the scroungers and shirkers on benefits. The fact is that children of unemployed families have kept pace: their income support has risen by 72% since 1997. Yet this is still, somehow, not the New Labour image, not their big story. They don't tell it often enough themselves, ambivalent, as ever, about who they are telling about what. </p> <p>Gordon Brown made an emotional speech, peppered with talk of a \"crusade against child poverty\" and a \"war\" to end its \"scourge and tragedy\". Tucked away in this he said: \"I am delighted that a broad-based coalition - an alliance for children - is coming together to fight child poverty.\" This is something he has devised and brought together himself, a much-needed single umbrella for the (too) many competing children's charities which often duplicate what they do, and waste money on competitively lurid fundraising. </p> <p>But behind his plan is something much stranger. He wants the children's alliance to go out and with one voice raise public indignation at child poverty. He said himself it must \"press government to accelerate the process of ending child poverty\". He wants it to act like Jubilee 2000 which twisted his arm to take a lead in abolishing third world debt. In other words, he has himself created a pressure group designed to whip him from pillar to post until he does what he wants to do anyway. </p> <p>Bizarre, says the Child Poverty Action group, who are also a part of the children's alliance. \"Does he really know what he wants?\" asks its director, Martin Barnes. When his group put out a press release mildly grateful for the chancellor's pre-budget largesse, but inevitably asking for more, a Treasury aide told him sourly it was \"unhelpful\". Yet the chancellor wants sharper critics? The alliance is as yet hesitant and unfledged, undecided whether it can unite or dare make political demands for poor children. It is sounding distinctly spineless. </p> <p> The chancellor needs them because the abolition of child poverty will not happen unless the people will it. It has to shoot up the political agenda. The recent clamour on fuel bills and basic pensions show how money flows inevitably to where the noise is loudest. Who shouts loud enough for children? If child poverty was such a burning issue, would the Tories have been elected four times in a row with never a backward glance at how the ranks of the poor swelled? </p> <p>Each tranche of poor children will be harder to reach. The next large group will be the children of single parents. When the new deal for lone parents rolls out next year, its high target is to get 70% into work, meeting the average for all mothers. (Only 49% of single mothers currently have jobs). That would take another 600,000 children out of poverty, almost hitting the 10-year target. What of the rest? Secretly it is whispered that in a full-employment world, when the great pool of people living a lifetime on benefits is gone, then greater generosity to those passing through relatively briefly is no political problem. More jobs and higher benefits mean no more poor children. </p> <p>But the 20-year Jerusalem is far off. By then, the idea is, the generation of babies born under Labour will be rescued by each special programme, pass through better schools and end up ready for a life of success and better jobs. But to get there, they will need to grow up without a poverty that would cripple their chances. </p> <p>Slice it whichever way, all this costs money that must be spent unfailingly in good times and in dips. When the clamour is all for new trains, or state-of-the-art cancer scanners or letting richer old people have free residential care, there has to be a persistent, strident voice saying, \"No, poor children must come first\". The truth is, they are not a popular cause. Children's charities have trouble showing them. If they look scruffy, the public is just reminded they have bad parents. Neat kids don't look poor. </p> <p>This new alliance is needed and it has to be tough, political, savvy and negative. Negative about less worthy demands on the public purse, for example. Where were the lobbies confronting the lorries with placards reading \"Children before diesel\"? And negative about the government when it muffles its message on poverty - unsure whether it dares declare how much money is being spent, let alone how much more needed. </p> <p>Gordon Brown has been looking across the Atlantic with a shudder. What if his booming prudence is discounted the way US voters dismissed the Democrat economy as if it were the weather? Many chose the glitter of trillions of tax cuts instead. Even if the children's alliance becomes a strong, vociferous lobby, in the end it is politicians who have to get out there and persuade the people: in the next election the abolition of poverty will slug it out against the abolition of poverty programmes. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Because the longer this year's disputed presidential contest continues, the more likely it becomes that the United States can look forward to a George W Bush-Al Gore rematch in 2004.</p> <p>As the battle for Florida plays itself out - and it's certainly not over yet - some politicians and pundits are already beginning to look ahead to the next presidential election in four years' time. There is no shortage of experts to suggest that Mr Bush, who is only 54, and Mr Gore, a mere 52, could be scrapping it out again.</p> <p>\"Before election night or the next morning, I would have said the chances for a rematch were zero, that the loser would be quickly forgotten. But we're in a different world now,\" the political scientist Norman Ornstein said the other day.</p> <p>We certainly are. The key to the new post-election dynamic would be that the eventual winner would be seen by half the country as the man who stole the White House. While the eventual loser will be seen as a martyr.</p> <p>If Mr Bush wins, then Mr Gore will be the first man since 1888 to win the popular vote in a presidential election and yet lose the presidency. If Mr Gore wins, capturing Florida's 25 electoral college votes at the end of a succession of court challenges and recounts, then it will be Mr Bush's to claim \"we wuz robbed\".</p> <p>So a rematch is now becoming the talk of Washington. The theory depends upon the loser bowing out gracefully, in a manner which would win him public gratitude for his concession while solidifying party support around him as the frontrunner for the 2004 battle. But heavyweights in both parties are already predicting a second Bush-Gore contest.</p> <p>\"Obviously, so much can happen between now and then. But you'd have to assume the presumptive nominee would be whoever lost this election. I can't imagine anyone else having a better claim at this stage,\" said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the leader of his party in the US Senate.</p> <p>\"I'd watch for a rematch with these gentlemen, absolutely. If the loser goes out in a dignified manner, he's be a shoo-in for his party's nomination in four years,\" said Scott Reed, who was Bob Dole's campaign manager against Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential election.</p> <p>Another argument in favour of a rematch, some believe, is that the situation in the Senate and House of Representatives is now so evenly balanced that the winning candidate will have enormous difficulty in getting any major legislation carried. In those circumstances, the loser would be able to rally his supporters behind the call for a change at the top.</p> <p>\"This is going to be a very difficult four years for either Al Gore or George Bush to govern. The economy likely will slow. Neither will have a sense of a mandate. It is bound to cause problems for the incumbent party,\" said Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, a Democrat.</p> <p>\"The loser will have millions of people nursing that grievance for four years, and that will prove invaluable,\" said Professor Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of folks who say [that], in the longer term, we would be better if we lost,\" said one Republican who did not want to be named.</p> <p>\"The presidential honeymoon could be a one-night stand,\" said another.</p> <p>There are precedents on both sides of the argument. Two-term presidents such as Andrew Jackson and Richard Nixon both recovered from losing a presidential election to claim the White House. On the other hand, other close losers have just faded into the background, like Thomas Dewey or Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>There's another point of view, of course. If Mr Gore loses, he will have lost as an incumbent at a time of peace and great prosperity.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Mikhail Lesin has a starring role in the endless soap opera over who will ultimately control Russia's two main television channels - the Kremlin or extremely wealthy ''disloyal oligarchs''.</p> <p>One of the most telling incidents illustrating the realities of contemporary political life in Russia occurred a few weeks ago, with Mr Lesin, minister for the media, again taking centre stage.</p> <p>He had just put his signature to a deal guaranteeing Vladimir Gusinsky, the media mogul and Kremlin foe, immunity from prosecution in return for agreement to surrender control of his media empire.</p> <p>News of the arrangement sparked uproar and the Kremlin had to go through the motions of upbraiding the media minister. Not that he would have to resign, of course, after flagrantly interfering with the judicial process and deploying the law as a political instrument.</p> <p>Instead Mr Lesin was punished publicly, if lightly, at a cabinet meeting, with the relevant bits televised and shown to the nation. Like an errant schoolboy caught passing smutty messages to the girls at the next desks, Mr Lesin was ordered to stand up before the rest of the cabinet class while the head teacher and prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, issued his rebuke.</p> <p>Head bowed in contrition, Mr Lesin waited to be branded a dunce and ordered to stand in the corner with his face to the wall. Instead, Mr Kasyanov ended his sermon, then issued a peremptory ''now, sit down'' to the naughty minister who did as he was told.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary piece of political theatre, a staged display of power, deference, and flouting of the law. Not that Mr Lesin's signature was worth much, anyway. This week the prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant for Mr Gusinsky after he failed to show up for questioning about fraud.</p> <p>All the same, that a government minister could sign a pledge guaranteeing immunity from prosecution in return for a business deal illustrates the uses and abuses to which the law is put in Russia.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin came to the Russian presidency earlier this year pledging to establish ''a dictatorship of the law'' and a level legal playing field in a culture where the prosecutor's office, the courts, and the police have long been toys in the hands of the politicians.</p> <p>On paper Russia is a law-based state. But then Stalin's Soviet Union was privileged to enjoy one of the most democratic constitutions ever written.</p> <p>The Lesin signature, which could not have been written without the nod from the Kremlin, strongly suggests that Mr Putin is less than keen to see the laws of the land observed. Either that or he is too weak to do much about it.</p> <p>Sergei Pashin, a Moscow judge and a liberal who has toiled down the years to introduce jury trials in Russia and correct rampant miscarriages of justice, has just been fired for defending a conscientious objector and getting up the noses of his colleagues.</p> <p>When the Kremlin recently needed to appoint a loyalist Chechen mayor of the destroyed Chechen capital, Grozny, it opted for Bislan Gantemirov, a convicted fraudster.</p> <p>The last time Gantemirov held the post, he was jailed for embezzling millions in Chechen reconstruction funds. The Putin team let him out of jail last year because they thought he could be useful to them in the Chechnya war.</p> <p>Mr Putin's own choice of language repeatedly shows scant regard for the law. He talks of ''taking a cudgel'' to the likes of Mr Gusinsky or the other enemy media magnate, Boris Berezovsky. He branded Andrei Babitsky, the fearless Radio Liberty journalist operating in Chechnya, a ''terrorist''.</p> <p>Some of Mr Putin's past actions, too, suggest a less than scrupulous attitude to the law.

      "bodyText": "Mikhail Lesin has a starring role in the endless soap opera over who will ultimately control Russia's two main television channels - the Kremlin or extremely wealthy ''disloyal oligarchs''. One of the most telling incidents illustrating the realities of contemporary political life in Russia occurred a few weeks ago, with Mr Lesin, minister for the media, again taking centre stage. He had just put his signature to a deal guaranteeing Vladimir Gusinsky, the media mogul and Kremlin foe, immunity from prosecution in return for agreement to surrender control of his media empire. News of the arrangement sparked uproar and the Kremlin had to go through the motions of upbraiding the media minister. Not that he would have to resign, of course, after flagrantly interfering with the judicial process and deploying the law as a political instrument. Instead Mr Lesin was punished publicly, if lightly, at a cabinet meeting, with the relevant bits televised and shown to the nation. Like an errant schoolboy caught passing smutty messages to the girls at the next desks, Mr Lesin was ordered to stand up before the rest of the cabinet class while the head teacher and prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, issued his rebuke. Head bowed in contrition, Mr Lesin waited to be branded a dunce and ordered to stand in the corner with his face to the wall. Instead, Mr Kasyanov ended his sermon, then issued a peremptory ''now, sit down'' to the naughty minister who did as he was told. It was an extraordinary piece of political theatre, a staged display of power, deference, and flouting of the law. Not that Mr Lesin's signature was worth much, anyway. This week the prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant for Mr Gusinsky after he failed to show up for questioning about fraud. All the same, that a government minister could sign a pledge guaranteeing immunity from prosecution in return for a business deal illustrates the uses and abuses to which the law is put in Russia. Vladimir Putin came to the Russian presidency earlier this year pledging to establish ''a dictatorship of the law'' and a level legal playing field in a culture where the prosecutor's office, the courts, and the police have long been toys in the hands of the politicians. On paper Russia is a law-based state. But then Stalin's Soviet Union was privileged to enjoy one of the most democratic constitutions ever written. The Lesin signature, which could not have been written without the nod from the Kremlin, strongly suggests that Mr Putin is less than keen to see the laws of the land observed. Either that or he is too weak to do much about it. Sergei Pashin, a Moscow judge and a liberal who has toiled down the years to introduce jury trials in Russia and correct rampant miscarriages of justice, has just been fired for defending a conscientious objector and getting up the noses of his colleagues. When the Kremlin recently needed to appoint a loyalist Chechen mayor of the destroyed Chechen capital, Grozny, it opted for Bislan Gantemirov, a convicted fraudster. The last time Gantemirov held the post, he was jailed for embezzling millions in Chechen reconstruction funds. The Putin team let him out of jail last year because they thought he could be useful to them in the Chechnya war. Mr Putin's own choice of language repeatedly shows scant regard for the law. He talks of ''taking a cudgel'' to the likes of Mr Gusinsky or the other enemy media magnate, Boris Berezovsky. He branded Andrei Babitsky, the fearless Radio Liberty journalist operating in Chechnya, a ''terrorist''. Some of Mr Putin's past actions, too, suggest a less than scrupulous attitude to the law. Earlier in his career when his boss Anatoliy Sobchak, the late mayor of St Petersburg, was wanted for questioning, Mr Putin personally organised the mayor's escape first to Finland then France. When the Kremlin wanted rid of a prosecutor-general investigating corruption in the Boris Yeltsin entourage, Mr Putin, then domestic intelligence chief, personally presented the law officer with a clandestinely filmed video purporting to show the prosecutor romping in bed with prostitutes. The video was then given to loyal state television and broadcast to the entire country. The prosecutor, Yuriy Skuratov, is long gone, his place taken by a Putin loyalist. Mr Lesin remains in the cabinet. Mr Gusinsky and Mr Berezovsky, fabulously wealthy and unsavoury businessmen who are the unlikeliest of martyrs in the cause of press freedom, are in exile abroad, fearful of coming home because the last thing they expect in Vladimir Putin's Russia is a fair trial.

      "body": "<p>Agencies working with people with learning disabilities had every reason to be cheerful when the Scottish executive unveiled a radical blueprint for developing services over the next 10 years. Yet six months on, very little seems to have happened. </p> <p>Scotland's first review of learning disability services for more than 20 years set a deadline for closing all long-stay hospitals by 2005, proposed a \"change fund\" to help local authorities and health boards implement the review and promised direct payments to allow people to buy their own services by 2003.</p> <p>Other key recommendations in The Same As You? review were: <br> \u0095 co-ordinators to support people in the community; <br>\u0095 establishing a Scottish centre for learning disabilities; and <br> \u0095 personal life plans for everyone who wants one</p> <p>Personal life plans, which describe how people with learning disabilities, their family and professionals can work together to create a fuller life, will replace existing community care assessments.</p> <p>The plans will set out personal assessed care needs including: <br>\u0095 short breaks for the person or their carer; <br>\u0095 meaningful work or other opportunities during the day; <br> \u0095 further education; <br>\u0095 housing and transport needs; and <br> \u0095 how each of these should be met</p> <p>Apart from confirming the hospital closure deadline, there has been little progress on the plans. Tenders for setting up the Scottish centre for learning disabilities were only invited in October and no firm plans have materialised, despite a spending commitment of \u00a336m over three years to help local authorities develop services.</p> <p>Norman Dunning, director of Scotland's largest learning disabilities charity, Enable, says an implementation plan is urgently needed. \"There is quite a lot of frustration because we haven't seen any action yet. It is a very good review, with lots of good ideas, but it is in grave danger of losing momentum. We need a definite statement of how much is going to be in the pot.

      "bodyText": "Agencies working with people with learning disabilities had every reason to be cheerful when the Scottish executive unveiled a radical blueprint for developing services over the next 10 years. Yet six months on, very little seems to have happened. Scotland's first review of learning disability services for more than 20 years set a deadline for closing all long-stay hospitals by 2005, proposed a \"change fund\" to help local authorities and health boards implement the review and promised direct payments to allow people to buy their own services by 2003. Other key recommendations in The Same As You? review were: \u0095 co-ordinators to support people in the community; \u0095 establishing a Scottish centre for learning disabilities; and \u0095 personal life plans for everyone who wants one Personal life plans, which describe how people with learning disabilities, their family and professionals can work together to create a fuller life, will replace existing community care assessments. The plans will set out personal assessed care needs including: \u0095 short breaks for the person or their carer; \u0095 meaningful work or other opportunities during the day; \u0095 further education; \u0095 housing and transport needs; and \u0095 how each of these should be met Apart from confirming the hospital closure deadline, there has been little progress on the plans. Tenders for setting up the Scottish centre for learning disabilities were only invited in October and no firm plans have materialised, despite a spending commitment of \u00a336m over three years to help local authorities develop services. Norman Dunning, director of Scotland's largest learning disabilities charity, Enable, says an implementation plan is urgently needed. \"There is quite a lot of frustration because we haven't seen any action yet. It is a very good review, with lots of good ideas, but it is in grave danger of losing momentum. We need a definite statement of how much is going to be in the pot. We would also like to see ongoing expenditure on learning disability services in Scotland - currently \u00a354 per head - at least brought in line with England at \u00a359 per head.\" For Enable, the review is a major step forward but it fears priority will be given to people leaving institutions at the expense of those already living in the community. \"It's scandalous that hospital closures have moved so slowly in Scotland, so we're delighted to see a firm date for their end. But there are also too few opportunities for adults currently living with their families to achieve the ordinary step of independence,\" says Dunning. Another concern is over plans for local registers of adults and children with learning disabilities as part of \"partnership in practice\" agreements between local authorities and health boards. Enable's consultation showed that, while carers saw it as a necessary evil, people with learning disabilities themselves didn't want a register. \"Nobody is enthusiastic about it, and there must be proper safeguards, but if it is a way of getting resources then maybe it has to be there,\" concedes Dunning.

      "body": "<p>The US supreme court has blocked the execution of a convicted killer whose low IQ is at the centre of a debate over whether he should be put the death.</p> <p>Johnny Paul Penry, condemned for the 1979 rape and murder of a 22-year-old woman while he was on parole for rape, is said to have such severe learning disabilities that he spends his days colouring with crayons and still believes in Santa Claus.</p> <p>Texas governor and Republican presidential hopeful George W Bush had rejected requests by Penry's supporters for a reprieve.</p> <p>However, last night the high court said it wanted more time to decide whether to hear arguments that Penry's learning disabilities had not been properly explained to the jury that convicted him. Several of Penry's relatives and a neighbour have also said that as a child he was brutally abused by his mentally ill mother, who is now dead.</p> <p>The court said the stay would last until it decides whether to take Penry's case, which could happen in a few weeks.</p> <p>\"At least I'm alive,\" Penry said when told of the reprieve.</p> <p>Penry, 44, was to become the 38th Texas inmate to be executed this year - the highest number by any state since the supreme court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976. It was the third execution scheduled in as many nights in Texas.</p> <p>Penry's case was at the centre of a landmark US supreme court decision on executing those with severe learning disabilities, and his impending execution drew protests from around the world. The European Union, anti-death penalty groups, the American Bar Association and advocates for those with learning disabilities urged Texas not to execute him.</p> <p>His lawyers say he has an IQ of 50 to 60 and the reasoning capacity of a seven-year-old. But prosecutors said Penry was ignorant and did not have learning disabilities. Texas attorney general John Cornyn said Penry was \"a schemer, a planner and can be purposefully deceptive\". The court was Penry's last chance, after the Texas board of pardons and paroles on Tuesday denied his request for a 30-day reprieve and a commutation to a lesser sentence.

      "bodyText": "The US supreme court has blocked the execution of a convicted killer whose low IQ is at the centre of a debate over whether he should be put the death. Johnny Paul Penry, condemned for the 1979 rape and murder of a 22-year-old woman while he was on parole for rape, is said to have such severe learning disabilities that he spends his days colouring with crayons and still believes in Santa Claus. Texas governor and Republican presidential hopeful George W Bush had rejected requests by Penry's supporters for a reprieve. However, last night the high court said it wanted more time to decide whether to hear arguments that Penry's learning disabilities had not been properly explained to the jury that convicted him. Several of Penry's relatives and a neighbour have also said that as a child he was brutally abused by his mentally ill mother, who is now dead. The court said the stay would last until it decides whether to take Penry's case, which could happen in a few weeks. \"At least I'm alive,\" Penry said when told of the reprieve. Penry, 44, was to become the 38th Texas inmate to be executed this year - the highest number by any state since the supreme court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976. It was the third execution scheduled in as many nights in Texas. Penry's case was at the centre of a landmark US supreme court decision on executing those with severe learning disabilities, and his impending execution drew protests from around the world. The European Union, anti-death penalty groups, the American Bar Association and advocates for those with learning disabilities urged Texas not to execute him. His lawyers say he has an IQ of 50 to 60 and the reasoning capacity of a seven-year-old. But prosecutors said Penry was ignorant and did not have learning disabilities. Texas attorney general John Cornyn said Penry was \"a schemer, a planner and can be purposefully deceptive\". The court was Penry's last chance, after the Texas board of pardons and paroles on Tuesday denied his request for a 30-day reprieve and a commutation to a lesser sentence. The court's decision prevented the case from reaching Mr Bush, who would have had to rule yesterday on whether to give Penry a 30-day reprieve - all that it is in his power to grant, under Texas law - or to allow the execution. Fourteen Texas state senators had written to Mr Bush urging him to issue a temporary reprieve - a step he has taken only once in his nearly six years in office. Mr Bush has presided over more executions than any other governor in the US, and Penry's low IQ, coupled with the fact that 13 states ban the execution of those with severe learning disabilities, means that the issue had become extremely politically sensitive as Mr Bush awaits the results of the disputed presidential election. Penry had two competency trials and two murder trials, the second after the US supreme court threw out his original death sentence. The court said it was not cruel and unusual punishment to execute those with learning disabilities, but juries must take the issue into account when considering the death penalty. About two dozen states allow the execution of killers with learning disabilities, although some are considering laws prohibiting the practice. In August, Oliver David Cruz, whose IQ tested as low as 63, received a lethal injection in Texas for a 1988 murder in San Antonio.

      "bodyText": "Florida's supreme court has ruled that the manual recount of votes in three contested counties can continue despite Republican attempts to declare a winner of the presidential election tomorrow. Officials in Palm Beach County have now begun a crucial manual recount of 460,000 votes that is likely to boost the chances of the Democratic presidential candidate, Al Gore. The party has threatened legal action if the Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris, refuses to accept the result. Ms Harris was Republican candidate George W Bush's campaign co-chairman in Florida and says the state's 25 electoral college votes will be allocated when the 2,600 postal votes are counted early tomorrow morning. But the result is unlikely to come so soon. Republicans are countering the Democrat's threat of legal action with an attempt in the federal court in Atlanta to shut the recounts down. The uncertainty comes from the supreme court ruling that there was \"no legal impediment\" to the recounts in Palm Beach, Miami-Dade and Broward counties but failing to address the thorny issue of whether Ms Harris should be required to accept them. The federal court has also agreed to consider a related case filed by three Bush supporters who claim their rights are being violated because their counties are not recanvassing votes by hand. The Republicans may demand recounts in Oregon, Wisconsin and New Mexico, which narrowly voted for Mr Gore, if the White House stays with the Democrats. Mr Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, said the recounts were justified. \"I think we've got to have some process to end this where the person elected president does not go in not only with a cloud over his head but with millions of people in America thinking that he got elected unfairly,\" he said. The Republicans, however, are less convinced. \"It is no longer really counting, it is manipulation,\" said Mr Bush's running mate Dick Cheney.

      "bodyText": "The row over the effects of advertising on children intensified today with the publication of research suggesting that ads may have more power over children than their parents do. The news adds weight to chancellor Gordon Brown's controversial comments this week about the damaging effects of advertising on underprivileged children. The consumer survey, published by the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM), found that 36% of adult consumers in the UK believe that advertising is the biggest influence on children, while only 17% believed parents have the most power. Peer pressure was believed to be slightly more persuasive than advertising, with 37% of respondents saying friends are the most influential factor. But although a majority of respondents believed the law should be strengthened to protect children against ads, only 17% thought advertising to children should be banned completely. Young people were particularly opposed to the introduction of stronger legislation. CIM director of marketing Ray Perry said: \"The group that finds advertising to children the least worrying are those consumers who have most recently experienced it as children themselves. \"This is indicative of the role that advertising to children has in informing them about products and educating them in the way that the media works.\" The chancellor provoked outrage in the marketing industry this week when he said he was struck by how unfair advertising was on children from deprived backgrounds who could not afford the products being pushed. Mr Brown's comments came at a time when the marketing industry is preparing its defences against the possibility of a Europe-wide ban on advertising to children. Sweden, which takes on the presidency of the European Union next year, is known to favour such a move.",

      "body": "<p>I don't know about you, but when I'm auditioning people to be my friend, there are a few questions I always try to run by them, casual-like. First, I'll want to know if they've ever said \"Enjoy\" in that sickening way only sad little castrates incapable of enjoying anything do. Then I'll want to know that they're not going to be dreary and boring about the loyalty thing, and that we both understand that if a better offer comes up and Kate Moss wants either of us to be her best friend on pain of never seeing the other one again, then naturally it's all off. But the third question is, inevitably, the tie-breaker. Answered right, I'll pass on the other two. And it is: Who was your favourite Charlie's Angel? </p> <p>Now some people might think that this is a trick question. The coolest Charlie's Angel of all time was Tanya Roberts as Julie, the last draftee before the show's cancellation. Unlike the other girls who must have married their Carmen rollers, Julie had poker-straight hair and a voice full of guts and gravel compared to their breathy babeishness. Tanya turned out to be pretty damned cool, too; a tough, working-class, New York girl with a nice line in put-downs and - it eventually transpired in the Sunday papers - a liking for Cocaine Sex Parties With French Girls. </p> <p>But that's beside the point. The draftees don't matter: if you say that Tanya was your favourite, or Shelley Hack, or even Cheryl Ladd, you're missing the point. Only Jill (Farrah Fawcett), Sabrina (Kate Jackson) and Kelly (Jaclyn Smith) really matter, really signify in the rich tapestry of pop culture. It's like Boss Cat also being called Top Cat, or ignoring the fact that there was more than one Darrin in Bewitched - if you have to ask you'll never understand. The correct answer is, of course, \"Jaclyn!\" - said with a gasp before and a sigh afterwards. </p> <p>Jaclyn, Jaclyn - beautiful Jaclyn Smith, with the gimmicky name and the timeless beauty, as completely and uniquely herself as Helen of Troy or Sade Adu. A sphinx without a secret, an angel without wings, a Jewish girl from one of the richest retailing families in Texas, Jaclyn was always something of a mystery, which is a mystery itself in a business where the participants are only too happy to splurge every last detail of their private lives in our faces. All we knew about her, really, was that she'd been married to a man called Roger but they divorced, and all we know now is that she eventually married a Scots technician she met on the set of a TV film and had a baby which she called Gaston. But, hey, nobody's perfect. </p> <p>You weren't meant to like Jaclyn best - Farrah, \"Jill\", was the sexy one, and Kate, \"Sabrina\", was the \"clever\" one (which meant she was flat-chested). But Farrah had a vulpine, masculine face beneath her spectacular blondeness and Kate had a witchy little voice. My friend had a theory that women liked Jaclyn because she was divorced - whereas Farrah was smugly married and Kate stroppily single, Jaclyn combined both the idealism and combativeness of the modern woman, thus resulting in her divorcee status. It was her character who was immortalised on the most resonant and haunting LP of recent years - Air's Moon Safari, with Kelly, Watch the Stars. I once recall the Air boys, in their charmingly halting English, explaining themselves: \"Eet ees not Jaclyn Smeeth we are so fascinated by, eet ees Kellee. We think of Kellee as being the most perfect person, ever.\" </p> <p>But for myself and most of the other teenage girls who grew up with Charlie's Angels, it was hard to tell where Jaclyn stopped and Kelly started, as indeed it was with the other actresses. Farrah really was a sports-mad airhead, we could tell, and Kate was obviously a bit of a cow. But it didn't matter; the original triumvirate of Angels, lasting only from 1976 to 1978, were as perfect as a circle. If Jill was sporty, Sabrina was analytical; if Sabrina was abrasive, Kelly was comforting; if Kelly was soft, Jill was crisp. When Farrah left after only one season - her character Jill Munroe being replaced by Cheryl Ladd, as Jill's younger sister Chris - the circle slumped and became a sort of squidgy oval. By the time Shelley and Tanya had been substituted, the show was a big, shapeless mess. When it was finally cancelled in 1981, after 109 episodes, everyone had had a gut-full. </p> <p>It was all so different in the beginning. ABC was always the poor relation of American TV networks, ranking lowest ever since its creation and only ever managing a couple of really big shows, one of which was Happy Days. Obviously, they were delighted when Charlie's Angel became the top show of the 1976-77 season and the only new show on any network to become an out-and-out hit. By the end of the first run, 59% of all televisions in use when the show was aired were tuned into it: 23m households. And it never left the Nielsen top 10 for its first three years. There were further surprises when a breakdown of the audience showed that it had ranked fourth in metropolitan areas, seventh amongst college graduates and seventh with the highest-income group. The girls got 18,000 letters a week and ABC charged the highest advertisement rate ever for commercials: $100,000 a minute by the end of the first season. </p> <p>A lot of rubbish is talked these days about girl power and how Charlie's Angels were there first, and an equal amount about how exploitative and sexist it all was. In truth, it was neither: neither saint nor sinner, dom nor sub. It was, instead, one of those sublime, silly, shimmering moments when popular culture gets it absolutely right, like Mony Mony, Coca-Cola or The Simpsons. Up until the 1970s, women on American TV shows had been housewives and mothers; even big stars asked us to suspend our credibility and buy them as dizzy broads forever being scolded by their hubbies. Then Mary Tyler Moore, who had spent the 1960s as the archetypal American angel of the hearth in the Dick Van Dyke Show, reinvented her self as a bold yet vulnerable big city career girl for The Mary Tyler Moore Show. </p> <p>So great was the resonance of this show that Oprah Winfrey, by then the most powerful woman on TV, would be reduced to tears when she greeted a frail, much older Tyler Moore on an episode of Oprah. You'd have needed a heart of stone not to whimper along as Winfrey recalled how, during her impoverished and abused youth in a deep south shack, this paragon of white WASPishness had been her greatest inspiration in holding on to the dream. </p> <p>That's how desperate we were then for TV heroines who weren't wives and mothers; Mary Tyler Moore, stuttering in fear before her fierce editor Lou Grant, seemed like the shining path. In this context, it's not surprising that the Angels - with their guns, judo throws and ability to escape from any situation unscathed, no matter how savage or sordid - seemed like salvation. </p> <p>Would they have been the same if they'd been called The Alley Cats? This was what Aaron Spelling, who created the show as a vehicle for Kate Jackson, star of his series The Rookies, wanted them to be known as. Another abandoned blueprint was that they would be three undercover policewomen; in a typical act of puny yet pungent Lib-Lite, Jackson suggested that the trio should instead be private investigators who had not been able to advance in the male-dominated LAPD, and that Angels was rather less offensively stereotyped than Alley Cats. </p> <p>It was Jackson, the most conventionally feminist-minded of the actresses, who suggested the gimmick of the ever-absent Charlie - and, though this has since been reinterpreted as a terminally chauvinistic touch, I think there is something to be said for the way it added to the male-free feeling of the show, to a degree unparalleled before or since. Even the \"real woman\" dramas of Kay Mellor feature the boyfriends and husbands of the heroines week in, week out; but Angel-land truly was an Adam-less Eden in which the only men were agents of evil or disposable dupes. </p> <p>Once in a while you'd see them get off with some Brett Rockjaw at the end of the show, but next week, they'd be back on the couches together waiting for the word from Charlie, and none of the previous week's romantic nuances would ever be mentioned. At a time when the only test of maturity is whether or not you have an all-important boyfriend, the Angels indicated that it was really grown-up and glamorous not to bother with that stuff at all. </p> <p>Or perhaps the motivation was more sinister, in the way that pop star scream idols were always instructed by the management to appear single at all times (it says a lot for John Lennon's \"integrity\" that he kept his wife Cynthia under wraps for years; Ronan Keating never bothered). Perhaps the Angels were made to appear permanently unattached so that male audiences would become more loyal and more partisan about their Angel. </p> <p>While women watched to see women doing \"men's jobs\" in fancy frocks, men were apparently attracted by what came to be known as the \"jiggle factor\". Typically, at least one Angel will be put in a position where she must strip down to a bikini in the first 10 minutes, or thereafter bring the future of western civilisation into question. The episode titles were all a big tease, too, the first season containing the notorious Angels in Chains as well as Consenting Adults, Dirty Business, Lady Killers and The Blue Angels. The last was an investigation into the pornography industry, but the Angels kept those bikinis on. </p> <p>Call me an old-fashioned girl, but I would much rather have been an actress in the days of tease and jiggle than now, when every role offered to women between the ages of 18 and 35 will at some point include a close-up gynaecological examination. But that, as they say, was then. This is now. Now there's a film. When Drew Barrymore took it into her head to produce a big budget Charlie's Angels movie a couple of years back, you could practically hear the horny hands rubbing all across Hollywood at the prospect of every guy's favourite fantasy - the catfight - played out between mega-babes. </p> <p>When it was confirmed that Cameron Diaz (aka Sexy Blonde Ex-Model) and Lucy Liu (aka Horny Oriental Wildcat) would star alongside Drew (aka Curvy Bisexual Wildchild), the media flew into a frenzy of activity detailing alleged friction and fur-pulling between the three and a spectacular bomb at the box office. It didn't happen and the film opened earlier this month to take $40m on its first weekend, going straight to the top of the film charts and staying there. </p> <p>Diaz, Liu and Barrymore are good actresses and cool icons - but they seem diminished by playing the Angels in a way that the original cast did not. This is, I think, because they are taking it far too seriously, trying to make a feminist statement in an arena which is singularly unsuited to it. The problem is most clearly illustrated with the theme song, by the clumping Destiny's Child: \"We're independent women/ All the honeys got the money/ All the mommas got the dollars.\" Which is blatantly both untrue and horribly self-righteous. What was fine as throwaway seems utterly demeaning as a big deal. </p> <p>I was hardly a sweet innocent thing during the reign of the Angels - when it started, in 1976, I was a scrappy young punk of 16; and when it ended, in 1981, I was a notoriously cynical young madam of 21. But it spoke to me in those difficult years, nevertheless, about the gap between what you want and what you need, and - more importantly - between what it says on the shampoo bottle and the hair you end up with. I still can't hear that beautiful, yearning, swirling theme song - which spoke to us nervous young suburban virgins of career girls and swank apartments and sumptuous loneliness beside a swimming pool - without smiling and thinking, yep, it was worth it after all. </p> <p>In its purest form, Charlie's Angels spoke dumbly to our dumb hearts, in those days before Aids, pierced navels and cable porn in every home. They were foolish, Day-Glo, layered, what's-your-sign, yes-I-like-pina-colada days, and frankly I loved them. But we're not that dumb any more, so there's no excuse. </p> <p>And I won't be going to see the film. </p> <p><strong>What the angels did next </strong><br> Merope Mills</p> <p><strong>Farrah Fawcett</strong><br> (aka Angel Jill Munroe)<br> Fawcett quit Charlie's Angels after one season to pursue a film career, appearing in sci-fi flicks Logan's Run and Saturn 3. After splitting with first husband Lee Majors, she had a son, Redmond, with Ryan O'Neal. In the early 1980s she had a hit with The Cannonball Run, then disappeared into a string of TV movies. In 1995, she stripped for Playboy and has since been plagued by accusations of drug and alcohol abuse. On Letterman in 1997 she seemed \"confused\" and rambled incoherently for 20 minutes. She has been in Ally McBeal, and was cast by Robert Altman in his new film Dr T &amp; the Women, for which she demanded cast and crew watch her nude scenes.</p> <p> <strong>Kate Jackson</strong><br> (aka Sabrina Duncan) <br> Jackson was forced to turn down the Meryl Streep role in Kramer Vs Kramer because of her Angels commitments. After leaving the series in 1979, she tried her hand at the movies in Making Love, a romantic comedy about LA swingers. Jackson went back to TV in the mid-1980s with Scarecrow and Mrs King, playing a suburban mom opposite Bruce Boxleitner. Then she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and campaigned to raise awareness of the condition. She had more health problems - including cardiac surgery in 1993. Two years later she adopted a child, Charles Taylor Jackson. Most recent role: alongside Shannen Doherty in the TV movie Satan's School for Girls. </p> <p> <strong>Jaclyn Smith</strong><br> (aka Kelly Garrett)<br> The only Angel to last all five series, Smith stuck almost exclusively to TV movies afterwards. She played Jackie Kennedy in 1981, Jennifer Parker in Sidney Sheldon's Rage of Angels in 1983, and Florence Nightingale in 1985 - she was soon nicknamed \"queen of the miniseries\". Smith got a TV series, Christine Cromwell, in 1989, in which she played the eponymous amateur detective. Before Angels, Smith was a Max Factor model; afterwards, she continued to front for the cosmetics company, as well as managing a signature collection for the oh-so-classy K-Mart chain. Smith is currently on her fourth husband, heart surgeon Bradley Allen. </p> <p> <strong>Cheryl Ladd</strong><br> (aka Kris Munroe)<br> Fawcett's 1977 replacement recorded two albums, Cheryl Ladd and Dance Forever, while doing the show. After it finished, she too graduated into TV moviedom, appearing in a stack of Danielle Steel adaptations. Her main movie highlight was playing a pill-popping hypochondriac in 1992's Poison Ivy - alongside, ironically, Drew Barrymore. Ladd divorced her first husband David (son of Alan) and married movie producer Brian Russell. She recently began writing children's books. In Permanent Midnight (her one recent movie credit of note) she played an ageing TV actress, star of a fictitious show called No Such Luck. She is currently appearing in Annie Get Your Gun! on Broadway.</p> <p> <strong>Shelley Hack</strong><br> (aka Tiffany Welles)<br> Before Angels, Hack was a successful model (the \"Charlie\" perfume ads) and struggling bit-part actor. Afterwards, she starred in two failed TV series, Cutter to Houston and Jack &amp; Mike. She had small movie parts in Scorsese's The King of Comedy and the ur-domestic-slasher The Stepfather. In the 1990s, acting took a back seat to activism: she was a polling station supervisor in the 1997 elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and was asked by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to produce televised presidential debates there. She is currently working to restore TV production in the country.</p> <p> <strong>Tanya Roberts</strong><br> (aka Julie Rogers)<br> After her brief Angels stint, Roberts got into features: sword-and-sandals fantasy The Beastmaster (for which Roberts did a Playboy spread in 1982), leopardskin cheesecake Sheena: Queen of the Jungle; and Roger Moore's final 007 flick, A View to a Kill. She then declared: \"Most of James Bond's leading ladies have gone on to become big, big stars. And I'm going to join them I'm not taking my clothes off any more.\" After three years of unemployment she began to crack, and became the doyenne of the straight-to-video \"erotic thriller\" industry. She packed all that in in the mid-90s, and rode the retro wave to score a leading role in That 70s Show.</p> <p> \u0095 Charlie's Angels is released next Friday.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.charliesangels.com/\" target=\"_new\">Angelic Heaven</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.spe.sony.com/tv/shows/sgn/ca/\" target=\"_new\">Screen Gems' CA site</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nick-at-nite.com/tvretro/shows_tvl/charlies/index_intro.tin?sFlash=\" 5.0r30\"\" target=\"_new\">TV Land Charlie's Angels pages</a> (uses Flash)</p> <p><a href=\"http://home.swipnet.se/~w-78172/\" target=\"_new\">Angel Net</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.charliesangelsfan.com/\" target=\"_new\">Charlie's Angels collectibles</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Park/7932/angels.html\" target=\"_new\">Charlie's Angels: a history</a></p>",

Up until the 1970s, women on American TV shows had been housewives and mothers; even big stars asked us to suspend our credibility and buy them as dizzy broads forever being scolded by their hubbies. Then Mary Tyler Moore, who had spent the 1960s as the archetypal American angel of the hearth in the Dick Van Dyke Show, reinvented her self as a bold yet vulnerable big city career girl for The Mary Tyler Moore Show. So great was the resonance of this show that Oprah Winfrey, by then the most powerful woman on TV, would be reduced to tears when she greeted a frail, much older Tyler Moore on an episode of Oprah. You'd have needed a heart of stone not to whimper along as Winfrey recalled how, during her impoverished and abused youth in a deep south shack, this paragon of white WASPishness had been her greatest inspiration in holding on to the dream. That's how desperate we were then for TV heroines who weren't wives and mothers; Mary Tyler Moore, stuttering in fear before her fierce editor Lou Grant, seemed like the shining path. In this context, it's not surprising that the Angels - with their guns, judo throws and ability to escape from any situation unscathed, no matter how savage or sordid - seemed like salvation. Would they have been the same if they'd been called The Alley Cats? This was what Aaron Spelling, who created the show as a vehicle for Kate Jackson, star of his series The Rookies, wanted them to be known as. Another abandoned blueprint was that they would be three undercover policewomen; in a typical act of puny yet pungent Lib-Lite, Jackson suggested that the trio should instead be private investigators who had not been able to advance in the male-dominated LAPD, and that Angels was rather less offensively stereotyped than Alley Cats. It was Jackson, the most conventionally feminist-minded of the actresses, who suggested the gimmick of the ever-absent Charlie - and, though this has since been reinterpreted as a terminally chauvinistic touch, I think there is something to be said for the way it added to the male-free feeling of the show, to a degree unparalleled before or since. Even the \"real woman\" dramas of Kay Mellor feature the boyfriends and husbands of the heroines week in, week out; but Angel-land truly was an Adam-less Eden in which the only men were agents of evil or disposable dupes. Once in a while you'd see them get off with some Brett Rockjaw at the end of the show, but next week, they'd be back on the couches together waiting for the word from Charlie, and none of the previous week's romantic nuances would ever be mentioned. At a time when the only test of maturity is whether or not you have an all-important boyfriend, the Angels indicated that it was really grown-up and glamorous not to bother with that stuff at all. Or perhaps the motivation was more sinister, in the way that pop star scream idols were always instructed by the management to appear single at all times (it says a lot for John Lennon's \"integrity\" that he kept his wife Cynthia under wraps for years; Ronan Keating never bothered). Perhaps the Angels were made to appear permanently unattached so that male audiences would become more loyal and more partisan about their Angel. While women watched to see women doing \"men's jobs\" in fancy frocks, men were apparently attracted by what came to be known as the \"jiggle factor\". Typically, at least one Angel will be put in a position where she must strip down to a bikini in the first 10 minutes, or thereafter bring the future of western civilisation into question. The episode titles were all a big tease, too, the first season containing the notorious Angels in Chains as well as Consenting Adults, Dirty Business, Lady Killers and The Blue Angels. The last was an investigation into the pornography industry, but the Angels kept those bikinis on. Call me an old-fashioned girl, but I would much rather have been an actress in the days of tease and jiggle than now, when every role offered to women between the ages of 18 and 35 will at some point include a close-up gynaecological examination. But that, as they say, was then. This is now. Now there's a film. When Drew Barrymore took it into her head to produce a big budget Charlie's Angels movie a couple of years back, you could practically hear the horny hands rubbing all across Hollywood at the prospect of every guy's favourite fantasy - the catfight - played out between mega-babes. When it was confirmed that Cameron Diaz (aka Sexy Blonde Ex-Model) and Lucy Liu (aka Horny Oriental Wildcat) would star alongside Drew (aka Curvy Bisexual Wildchild), the media flew into a frenzy of activity detailing alleged friction and fur-pulling between the three and a spectacular bomb at the box office. It didn't happen and the film opened earlier this month to take $40m on its first weekend, going straight to the top of the film charts and staying there. Diaz, Liu and Barrymore are good actresses and cool icons - but they seem diminished by playing the Angels in a way that the original cast did not. This is, I think, because they are taking it far too seriously, trying to make a feminist statement in an arena which is singularly unsuited to it. The problem is most clearly illustrated with the theme song, by the clumping Destiny's Child: \"We're independent women/ All the honeys got the money/ All the mommas got the dollars.\" Which is blatantly both untrue and horribly self-righteous. What was fine as throwaway seems utterly demeaning as a big deal. I was hardly a sweet innocent thing during the reign of the Angels - when it started, in 1976, I was a scrappy young punk of 16; and when it ended, in 1981, I was a notoriously cynical young madam of 21. But it spoke to me in those difficult years, nevertheless, about the gap between what you want and what you need, and - more importantly - between what it says on the shampoo bottle and the hair you end up with. I still can't hear that beautiful, yearning, swirling theme song - which spoke to us nervous young suburban virgins of career girls and swank apartments and sumptuous loneliness beside a swimming pool - without smiling and thinking, yep, it was worth it after all. In its purest form, Charlie's Angels spoke dumbly to our dumb hearts, in those days before Aids, pierced navels and cable porn in every home. They were foolish, Day-Glo, layered, what's-your-sign, yes-I-like-pina-colada days, and frankly I loved them. But we're not that dumb any more, so there's no excuse. And I won't be going to see the film. What the angels did next Merope Mills Farrah Fawcett (aka Angel Jill Munroe) Fawcett quit Charlie's Angels after one season to pursue a film career, appearing in sci-fi flicks Logan's Run and Saturn 3. After splitting with first husband Lee Majors, she had a son, Redmond, with Ryan O'Neal. In the early 1980s she had a hit with The Cannonball Run, then disappeared into a string of TV movies. In 1995, she stripped for Playboy and has since been plagued by accusations of drug and alcohol abuse. On Letterman in 1997 she seemed \"confused\" and rambled incoherently for 20 minutes. She has been in Ally McBeal, and was cast by Robert Altman in his new film Dr T &amp; the Women, for which she demanded cast and crew watch her nude scenes. Kate Jackson (aka Sabrina Duncan) Jackson was forced to turn down the Meryl Streep role in Kramer Vs Kramer because of her Angels commitments. After leaving the series in 1979, she tried her hand at the movies in Making Love, a romantic comedy about LA swingers. Jackson went back to TV in the mid-1980s with Scarecrow and Mrs King, playing a suburban mom opposite Bruce Boxleitner. Then she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and campaigned to raise awareness of the condition. She had more health problems - including cardiac surgery in 1993. Two years later she adopted a child, Charles Taylor Jackson. Most recent role: alongside Shannen Doherty in the TV movie Satan's School for Girls. Jaclyn Smith (aka Kelly Garrett) The only Angel to last all five series, Smith stuck almost exclusively to TV movies afterwards. She played Jackie Kennedy in 1981, Jennifer Parker in Sidney Sheldon's Rage of Angels in 1983, and Florence Nightingale in 1985 - she was soon nicknamed \"queen of the miniseries\". Smith got a TV series, Christine Cromwell, in 1989, in which she played the eponymous amateur detective. Before Angels, Smith was a Max Factor model; afterwards, she continued to front for the cosmetics company, as well as managing a signature collection for the oh-so-classy K-Mart chain. Smith is currently on her fourth husband, heart surgeon Bradley Allen. Cheryl Ladd (aka Kris Munroe) Fawcett's 1977 replacement recorded two albums, Cheryl Ladd and Dance Forever, while doing the show. After it finished, she too graduated into TV moviedom, appearing in a stack of Danielle Steel adaptations. Her main movie highlight was playing a pill-popping hypochondriac in 1992's Poison Ivy - alongside, ironically, Drew Barrymore. Ladd divorced her first husband David (son of Alan) and married movie producer Brian Russell. She recently began writing children's books. In Permanent Midnight (her one recent movie credit of note) she played an ageing TV actress, star of a fictitious show called No Such Luck. She is currently appearing in Annie Get Your Gun! on Broadway. Shelley Hack (aka Tiffany Welles) Before Angels, Hack was a successful model (the \"Charlie\" perfume ads) and struggling bit-part actor. Afterwards, she starred in two failed TV series, Cutter to Houston and Jack &amp; Mike. She had small movie parts in Scorsese's The King of Comedy and the ur-domestic-slasher The Stepfather. In the 1990s, acting took a back seat to activism: she was a polling station supervisor in the 1997 elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and was asked by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to produce televised presidential debates there. She is currently working to restore TV production in the country. Tanya Roberts (aka Julie Rogers) After her brief Angels stint, Roberts got into features: sword-and-sandals fantasy The Beastmaster (for which Roberts did a Playboy spread in 1982), leopardskin cheesecake Sheena: Queen of the Jungle; and Roger Moore's final 007 flick, A View to a Kill. She then declared: \"Most of James Bond's leading ladies have gone on to become big, big stars. And I'm going to join them I'm not taking my clothes off any more.\" After three years of unemployment she began to crack, and became the doyenne of the straight-to-video \"erotic thriller\" industry. She packed all that in in the mid-90s, and rode the retro wave to score a leading role in That 70s Show. \u0095 Charlie's Angels is released next Friday.

He said cassonade is a dried substance, usually, but not always sugar, which is defined by the size of the granules as well as the level of sweetness. Oh, do the hokey-cokey and shake it all about. Sounds like chef-poesy to me. What does it taste like? Hot stuff. Just out Yellow beans Form: Long pods like bobby beans or extra big French beans, and distinctly yellow. Flavour: Very bean-like; fresh, slightly grassy; quite mild; really rather delicious. Verdict: A handsome addition to the range of beans and domestic vegetables. But beware. The yellow bean conceals a hidden menace. No, not the ones you're thinking of. They need to be thoroughly de-strung. High tensile fibre runs down either side of each bean, which, if not removed, can cause very dramatic choking fits as the fibres link the bit of the bean you've swallowed to the bit if the bean still in your mouth.

The pickled onion, like the sausage and fish and chips, is one of the few universal foods of the country, and one for which there is the same half-humorous affection.

You subject the food to be pickled to salt in its dry form or as a brine to draw out some of the water, which otherwise would dilute the vinegar into which you then plunge them (having washed off the salt), along with flavouring spices such as cloves, allspice and coriander and chilli if you feel like a hot pickle, and that's about it - the safe and simple method of preserving foods produced in times of abundance for times when they aren't. Early Britons would have used verjuice, a sour concoction made from crab apples, while earlier Romans and Greeks, and the Egyptians and Sumerians before them, would have used the same stuff only made from grapes. Vinegar is a relative newcomer to the cook's armoury. </p> <p>By impregnating foods with acids, we protect them from the microbes that otherwise would sprout on them. The most usual form of pickling is the salt'n'vinegar method, but there is another branch of the art, which involves fermenting the food. Fermentation causes acid-producing bacteria to grow, which has the same effect as the vinegar in the long term.

But recently, a new openness has swept through the houses, with designers speaking out like never before.

It's very flea market-like, isn't it? Or is it a T-shirt label?\" he says about Stella McCartney's work (tellingly, he was the Chloe designer until the early 90s). And about his 60s contemporaries? \"There was this place called Le Fiacre that had a gay cruising area downstairs and a trendy restaurant upstairs,\" he declares. \"Valentino and Yves were there every night. Yves spent most of his time upstairs, but Valentino was downstairs - never upstairs.\" Touch\u00e9. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Giorgio Armani has become publicly dismissive of his rival Italian fashion houses. \"Gucci is an assembler of things,\" he declares. \"It seems that Tom Ford finds these little bits and pieces everywhere and puts them together. Above all, things that were made by other people.\" Armani also reignited the bitter war between him and the house of Versace, by quoting Gianni Versace as admitting: \"I dress sluts.\" </p> <p>Some designers reserve their anger for their bosses. \"Fire me! 'Cause that's what I wanted anyway,\" Alexander McQueen taunts Givenchy in the current issue of Arena. \"Yeah, I did want to leave, but I can't. I have to see my contract through.\" So begins an astonishing assault that confirms all of fashion-land's suspicions about his feelings for the house. Since McQueen started at Givenchy in 1996, it has been clear that the relationship has been a fractious one, never having the mutual respect experienced by LVMH colleagues John Galliano at Dior or Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton. With every season, the rumours of an imminent split have grown stronger, but McQueen has managed to keep his cool, until now. </p> <p>In explaining his reasons for the feud, McQueen lets slip some secrets about how the industry works. The designer does not necessarily have control of what eventually goes on sale. \"When the collections leave my hands,\" he states, \"they go into the hands of other people and then whatever I've done on the catwalks has been dismissed. As you can see from the windows and the advertising. It just gets completely taken away.\" </p> <p>As well as having to put up with in-house machinations, poor McQueen also gets it in the ear from two of the old guard: Yves Saint Laurent and Vivienne Westwood. \"There are murderers at the couture houses,\" exclaims Saint Laurent, then separately states, \"Givenchy's clients are coming to me now. There is no one. I don't see a single talent.\" Meanwhile, Westwood was typically curt with her comments. \"His only usefulness is as a measure of zero talent.\" McQueen has replied to both of their attacks. \"I kind of had high regard for her,\" he says, \"but I think she's starting to sound as naff as Malcolm McLaren.\" And YSL? \"It's sad. It's like pop stars. People should know when to pack it in.\" </p> <p>This new honesty is extending to designers' private lives. While not exactly being out and proud, usually closeted fashion players have started to be more open about their homosexuality: McQueen says he is married to his partner, George, who appears to have had a profoundly calming influence on the once troubled designer, Tom Ford is happily settled with Vogue Hommes International editor Richard Buckley and Giorgio Armani has spoken for the first time about his personal relationship with his late business partner Sergio Rossi. Even Lagerfeld is more open, if dismissive. Asked when he last had sex, he brusquely states: \"I can't remember, and even if I could I wouldn't tell you. You should save questions like that for Tom Ford - he likes to talk about that kind of thing.\" </p> <p>This sudden frankness seems in part to be caused by the wave of retrospectives, retirements and acquisitions in fashion at the moment; designers of the older generation appear to be taking stock and reflecting on their situation. Armani has spoken at length to support his current 25th anniversary exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Lagerfeld was meant to be showing across Fifth Avenue at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but the display was pulled at the last minute, causing acrimony in uptown society and gleeful bitching from the designer himself. Saint Laurent, now only in control of his couture collections, has relaxed his legendary nervous disposition.

The Plain English Campaign, the pressure group that battles against gobbledegook, also voted the Daily Telegraph as best national newspaper. John Lister, a senior spokesperson for the awards, said: \"The Telegraph winning will come as a surprise to some people but they do write appropriately for their intended audience. \"They've done a particularly good job of highlighting how officialese and confusing forms affect people in all walks of life.\" The annual awards ceremony recognises reporters working in newspapers, radio and television for their clear communication. Other awards went to News North-West for best regional newspaper, Week In, Week Out from BBC Wales for best regional television programme, Sunday Service from BBC Five Live for best national radio programme and BBC Northampton for best regional radio station. News North West picked up its award for concise reporting \"for commuters who don't have time to wade through lengthy articles\". Week In, Week Out was praised for its courage in tackling potentially complicated issues and concentrating on how issues affect real people. Sunday Service presenters were commended for letting everyone express their view and for 'not putting up with any bull'. BBC Northampton, representing a town where Christmas lights were once referred to as 'festive embellishments of an illuminatory nature', was also highlighted for its use of simple English.

The industry expects the next-step technology, GPRS, to boost mobile internet access next year by providing far higher speeds and an \"always on\" service which means there is no need to dial up. Pressures for unmetered internet access have been felt most strongly in the fixed-line market where a range of packages are now available. BT claims this is the first time that model has been adapted for the wireless market .",

It is for preventative projects for 5-13 year-olds, those left out by Sure Start for babies and Connexions for 13-18 year-olds. The list of charity projects includes the National Pyramid Trust, which runs 90 therapeutic Pyramid clubs for emotionally and socially deprived primary children to encourage them in school and avert disaster later. Baby Think Twice in Stevenage sends teenage mothers into schools to warn about what life with an unplanned baby is like. There are homework clubs and schemes for excluded children. Big Brothers and Sisters in Bristol sends young volunteers back into schools to mentor a pupil through exams.

The shocking legacy of the Tory years was one in three children born poor: a third of all the poor children in Europe are born British. </p> <p>So far, Labour has lifted a quarter of them out of poverty, partly through sharply rising employment, mainly through a phenomenal rise in benefits. It is curious how little these increases have entered into the national consciousness. With so much talk about \"a hand-up, not a hand-out\" and \"work is the best welfare\", there has been an assumption that all the money has gone to the \"deserving\" working poor on the working families tax credit and nothing much to the scroungers and shirkers on benefits. The fact is that children of unemployed families have kept pace: their income support has risen by 72% since 1997. Yet this is still, somehow, not the New Labour image, not their big story. They don't tell it often enough themselves, ambivalent, as ever, about who they are telling about what. </p> <p>Gordon Brown made an emotional speech, peppered with talk of a \"crusade against child poverty\" and a \"war\" to end its \"scourge and tragedy\". Tucked away in this he said: \"I am delighted that a broad-based coalition - an alliance for children - is coming together to fight child poverty.\" This is something he has devised and brought together himself, a much-needed single umbrella for the (too) many competing children's charities which often duplicate what they do, and waste money on competitively lurid fundraising. </p> <p>But behind his plan is something much stranger. He wants the children's alliance to go out and with one voice raise public indignation at child poverty. He said himself it must \"press government to accelerate the process of ending child poverty\". He wants it to act like Jubilee 2000 which twisted his arm to take a lead in abolishing third world debt. In other words, he has himself created a pressure group designed to whip him from pillar to post until he does what he wants to do anyway. </p> <p>Bizarre, says the Child Poverty Action group, who are also a part of the children's alliance. \"Does he really know what he wants?\" asks its director, Martin Barnes. When his group put out a press release mildly grateful for the chancellor's pre-budget largesse, but inevitably asking for more, a Treasury aide told him sourly it was \"unhelpful\". Yet the chancellor wants sharper critics? The alliance is as yet hesitant and unfledged, undecided whether it can unite or dare make political demands for poor children. It is sounding distinctly spineless. </p> <p> The chancellor needs them because the abolition of child poverty will not happen unless the people will it. It has to shoot up the political agenda. The recent clamour on fuel bills and basic pensions show how money flows inevitably to where the noise is loudest. Who shouts loud enough for children?

The next large group will be the children of single parents. When the new deal for lone parents rolls out next year, its high target is to get 70% into work, meeting the average for all mothers. (Only 49% of single mothers currently have jobs). That would take another 600,000 children out of poverty, almost hitting the 10-year target. What of the rest? Secretly it is whispered that in a full-employment world, when the great pool of people living a lifetime on benefits is gone, then greater generosity to those passing through relatively briefly is no political problem. More jobs and higher benefits mean no more poor children. </p> <p>But the 20-year Jerusalem is far off. By then, the idea is, the generation of babies born under Labour will be rescued by each special programme, pass through better schools and end up ready for a life of success and better jobs. But to get there, they will need to grow up without a poverty that would cripple their chances. </p> <p>Slice it whichever way, all this costs money that must be spent unfailingly in good times and in dips. When the clamour is all for new trains, or state-of-the-art cancer scanners or letting richer old people have free residential care, there has to be a persistent, strident voice saying, \"No, poor children must come first\". The truth is, they are not a popular cause. Children's charities have trouble showing them. If they look scruffy, the public is just reminded they have bad parents. Neat kids don't look poor. </p> <p>This new alliance is needed and it has to be tough, political, savvy and negative. Negative about less worthy demands on the public purse, for example.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> On a sunny day in the mid-1980s, Mark Brandon Read decided to get away from it all by heading to a remote Australian beach with his girlfriend. Alongside the cans of cold beer in his beach bag, he packed an automatic handgun, a five-shot revolver, an automatic pistol, a sawn-off shotgun, two Magnum revolvers, an automatic pistol and a fully automatic 30-shot machine gun with a silencer. \"Chopper\" Read, a Melbourne \"head-hunter\" who made his money by terrorising other criminals, had a price on his head. Worse, his shredded ears (the result of Read instructing a fellow prisoner to slash them off to facilitate his transfer to another prison block) and huge, tattooed torso were a dead giveaway. Chopper, named after a 1960s cartoon character, appeared to be heading for the chop. </p> <p>\"Those were my very paranoid days,\" says an altogether cheerier Chopper from his new home in Tasmania. \"I was certifiably insane. I wasn't a well person.\" After spending most of the last two decades in prison, he is now a free man and a best-selling author. He celebrates his 46th birthday this month, just as a film about his life is released in Britain. </p> <p>But, says writer-director Andrew Dominik, \"the film is a dramatisation in which liberties have been taken. It is not a biography.\" Although Read approves of the film, many do not. Rupert Murdoch's Fox corporation dropped it, while one Sydney cinema owner refused to show it, arguing that it should not have received government funding because it glamorises the actions of \"a moronic, low-life thug\". Fran Bladel, women's representative for the Tasmanian government, accused the film of conveying the message \"that to be cruel and vindictive and to beat women pushes you to hero status with a certain class of people\". </p> <p>Nevertheless, Chopper has been a huge hit, the first restricted 18-rated film to become an Australian box-office number one. From the moment the first fleet of prison ships arrived in 1788 to set up the penal colony that became Sydney, Australia has loved the idea of the larrikin - the wise-cracking, anti-authoritarian hoodlum. There was Ned Kelly, the bank robber, who became an icon after being hanged for murder in Melbourne in 1880. Leslie \"Squizzy\" Taylor, leader of the next generation of gangsters, enjoyed near-celebrity status in the city in the 1920s. Both have been the subject of books and films. </p> <p>\"Chopper has virtually vaulted into Australian language - people will talk about 'doing a Chopper Read',\" says John Silvester, a hard-bitten crime journalist for the Melbourne Age. Silvester did much to make it happen, editing all the books that Read roughed out on headed notepaper in Melbourne's notorious high-security Pentridge prison. </p> <p>\"The media created me,\" says Read, remembering his time spent entertaining courtrooms in the 1970s. \"Maybe it was my black sense of humour in the face of adversity that appealed to one or two journalists. I'm on some shooting charge and, the next thing you know, there are 50 members of the press in attendance. The case became a half-hour comedy session. Even the judge would burst out laughing. As a kid I was 6ft 2in, 18 stone, built like an ox, with lots of ego and I had this couldn't-care-less sense of humour. It was a breath of fresh air to have someone who said: 'Yes, I did it.' </p> <p>\"There was one case in court where the judge gave me two and a half years and I said: 'Two and a half years? How am I going to hold my head up with two and a half years?' I said: 'I blew that bloke's leg off. Two and a half years? I'm not leaving here until I get at least three.' And the judge said: 'You take your two and a half years and be happy with it.' The media were falling about the place. I failed to see the seriousness of my own life until I was about 40. The media loved me because I always had some insane quote or some funny story to tell. There were quite a few obscure reporters that became very well known on the strength that they could always get an interview with me. If you're going to enter the criminal world, what's the use just finishing up a name on a tombstone and no one has ever heard of you? Bugger that. You go all the way or not at all.\" </p> <p>Read went all the way, from an inauspicious start - for a criminal. Born in 1954, his upbringing by a strict Seventh Day Adventist mother and retired soldier father was ostensibly respectable. \"Personally, I think I am owed an apology,\" Read says of his early years. After running away from home on many occasions, he was sent to a mental hospital and given electric shock treatment. His father, traumatised after fighting in the second world war, slept with a loaded gun by his bed and taught his son to love weapons. Read tried to join the army but failed the psychiatric test. He dabbled in boxing and soon graduated from teenage troublemaker to Melbourne gang leader. </p> <p>Sydney is famed for its corruption and white-collar crime, but Melbourne has long been regarded as the home of real Australian gangsters. Criminal gangs \"stood over\" its dens of drink, prostitution and gambling in the 1960s and 1970s before turning to the drug trade, particularly heroin, in the 1980s and 1990s. </p> <p>Read terrorised his fellow criminals, robbing massage parlours and taking on contracts to maim and kill rivals throughout the 1970s. He had a \"Boy's Own\" view of society, reckons Silvester, until he was stabbed in jail by his best friend, Jimmy Loughnan. He was only in prison with Loughnan because he had tried in vain to fulfil a promise to get his mate released by abducting a Melbourne district court judge from a courtroom in 1978. Stitched up after his stabbing, Read was found doing press-ups in his cell with his intestines hanging out. Word spread of what Silvester calls \"his extraordinary capacity to deliver and absorb pain\". Unmarried, with no children and estranged from all his family apart from his dad, he seemed untouchable. </p> <p>After his release in 1986, even Melbourne's crooks flinched at some of his tactics, which included demanding money from criminals by threatening to blow them both up, with a deranged grin and a stick of gelignite strapped to his chest. Seven months later, Read was accused of killing drug-dealer Siam \"Sammy the Turk\" Ozerkam, after shooting him through the eye outside a nightclub. Miraculously, he was acquitted on the grounds of self-defence. But, by the end of 1987, he was banged up for burning down another drug-dealer's house, firing shots into the dealer's mother's home and shooting a criminal in the leg. \"It was a busy few months,\" comments Read. </p> <p>In 1990, Silvester wrote an article debunking the cult growing up around Chopper. Read replied with a Christmas card saying: \"My idea of a perfect Christmas would be to own a 1,000-room hotel and find a dead reporter behind each door. Ha ha ha.\" But Chopper had found someone to tell his story to and began maniacally firing off letters to Silvester, who turned them into Chopper's first autobiography. \"I have been involved in 19 deaths inside and outside jail since 1971,\" boasted Chopper in his literary debut. He went on to describe how he extorted money from criminals and roasted their feet with blowtorches. </p> <p>\"Nobody had ever spoken or written in that way in Australia,\" says Silvester. \"He said, 'Yeah, I've done everything you think I have and worse', and he said it with black humour and a total lack of contrition.\" Written mainly from his prison cell, Read's nine books have sold more than 400,000 copies via word of mouth, in a country where a 10,000 sale denotes bestseller status. They are also said to be the most shoplifted books in the country. </p> <p>Read was freed in 1992, proclaiming that he would never get into trouble again. Shortly afterwards, he was charged with shooting a biker associate. He returned to jail, married his girlfriend, Mary-Ann, and carried on writing. Released from prison in 1998, he announced his retirement from crime, saying he had a wife and publishers to support. He moved to a remote farm in Tasmania with Mary-Ann and they have a 14-month-old son, Charles. When not writing more \"silly books\", he chops wood for a living. He says he doesn't have many friends and keeps himself to himself. </p> <p>Read has often rationalised his violence by arguing he is not a murderer but \"a garbage disposal expert\". He dismisses his victims with lines like: \"He was a deserving soul.\" Some Australians agree, seeing Chopper as a vigilante, a \"Dirty Harry figure\", says Silvester. Numerous women sent Read admiring letters after he mentioned beating up a sex offender in prison. But he has never pretended to be Robin Hood. </p> <p>Read is scathing about the \"plastic godfathers\" he terrorised. \"I virtually went to war with them for 20 years, and I came out alive. What does that say for them?\" Much of his writing is near-satire on Melbourne's criminal fraternity, \"a totally unbelievable, blood-soaked, insane comedy of errors\". Read still dreams about his victims in his sleep and found Chopper a hard film to watch. He says 95% of it is true. \"I didn't realise until after the film that I had this terrible habit of apologising to people after some sort of major violent incident.\" </p> <p>When the film was released, it was feared he was pocketing the profits. But Read was having the last laugh - donating all his money to a police charity supporting children with cancer. \"Most crooks end up dead and unknown,\" he comments. \"You walk through the shadow of the valley of death and you try to get to the other end alive. Very few people make it. I emerged alive, married, with a 14-month-old son. The one who wins the game is the one who lives the longest.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Chopper is released next Friday.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Small children romping in a park; smiling mothers watching their carefree offspring. The opening shots of Into the Arms of Strangers - the new documentary about Kindertransport, which had its royal premiere last week - look almost interchangeable with the handful of photographs I have of myself in pre-Hitler Vienna. At the time, it seemed so settled, so normal, so like the life of countless middle-class children growing up in comfortable circumstances in central Europe. But for the Jewish families among them, even if they saw themselves as wholly assimilated into Austrian society, it turned out to be illusory. </p> <p>Two years later Austria had become a distant memory for me. A Kindertransport - a trainload of children whose parents had to be left behind - had brought me to safety but had muddled my sense of identity. I was in Britain, the country that had recognised me as a \"refugee from Nazi oppression\", but which nevertheless ranked even a child as an \"enemy alien\", a potential fifth column capable of undermining the war effort. My photographs of the war years show a sturdy child walking in the Lakeland, or in school uniform with my class at the Fairfield School, a private girls' school in Ambleside, Cumbria. </p> <p>A stranger studying my two sets of photographs - before and after leaving Vienna - might think that, chameleon-like, I had changed persona smoothly and made the cultural transition without undue disturbance. In fact, 60 years on, I am still trying to work out how my life, my way of thinking, my relationships and attitudes, my character, have been affected by having been uprooted from my native environment. Part of me believes it has been a successful transplant and that Britishness has become a second skin. But part of me also thinks I am fundamentally rootless - \"cosmopolitan\" has a more positive ring to it - and in recent times yet another part of me wonders whether it is possible to be both anglicised and to recapture an affinity with Austria. All of me, however, is convinced that every individual has a different way of dealing with hurt, but that refugees have one factor in common: in some - often imperceptible - way, they remain damaged goods. </p> <p>The Kindertransport added a unique phenomenon to refugeedom. Britain agreed in 1938 to take in unaccompanied Jewish children from Germany and Austria on condition that they would be found homes and not become a burden on the state. Their parents, unable to obtain visas for themselves and aware that the Nazis were closing in, preferred to send the children to safety, even if it meant breaking up the family. It was almost impossible to make the young understand that it was for their own good, and that they were not being rejected by their parents. </p> <p>Into the Arms of Strangers gives a bird's eye view of the effect of Kindertransport on the lives of a handful of refugees. I can identify with some of these, first and foremost the fact that everybody stresses their quick absorption of the English language coupled with a rejection of their native tongue, German. This reflected the deep urge to meld into the social fabric of their new homeland and to be treated on an equal basis. </p> <p>But the film also shames me into acknowledging the many gaps in my memory, a fact that has long troubled me. Unlike so many others, I can recall very little about my childhood in Vienna. Nor do I have in my mind's eye any clear impression of the parting from my mother on that March day in 1939, or of my train journey to London. The most vivid memory of that time is of my arrival in London, waiting at the reception centre at the railway to be picked up by two strangers who were to be my foster parents. </p> <p>I have revisited the park in Vienna where I was taken to play. I have stood outside the block of flats where we lived, and looked at the junior school where I was a pupil. But I have failed to reconstruct any personal intimacy with those places or to identify the friends who are in the handful of photographs I still possess. To a limited extent, I was able to extricate some of the flavour of that early life from talks with my mother, who survived and lived in Britain until her death in 1972. But I know now that I never asked enough questions. </p> <p>My parents had divorced before my fourth birthday and I barely knew my father or any of his family, who were orthodox Jews. My mother's family were non-practising Jews. Everyone was comfortably off, and my mother, though highly intelligent, had always lived in a world where women had neither the need nor the desire to earn a living. Fortunately she was a good cook. That proved invaluable in her quest for asylum abroad after Hitler's Anschluss of Austria. The search for escape became desperate in November 1938, after Kristallnacht, when the Nazis in Germany and Austria set about smashing synagogues and Jewish-owned properties. </p> <p>While the US, the country of choice for many of Austria's Jews, resisted any change to its strict quotas, Britain was more generous. Provided an affidavit could be secured - a financial guarantee from a British person - visas were issued. Women could only take jobs as domestic servants. </p> <p>British newspapers regularly carried \"refugee\" advertisements. I have a cutting of an ad placed by my mother seeking help for her mother - who was stranded in Prague and later died in the \"model\" concentration camp, Theresienstadt. \"Guarantor urgently needed. Lady (61) must leave Czechoslovakia; danger: please help.\" Beneath it, another advertisement reads \"LL.D. of Vienna, Jew, musical, versed in literature, bridge player, very adaptable, in distressful circumstances appeals urgently to kindhearted persons for guest permits for one year for self and wife (excellent cook, housekeeper and knitting modellist). Guarantee necessary is \u00a3200.\" </p> <p>My mother was fortunate. A friend from Vienna who had arrived in Britain earlier found a family prepared to employ her as a housemaid. Three months after my Kindertransport, my mother arrived. My foster parents lived in the west London suburb of Brondesbury. The Infields were business people. They too were non-practising Jews and had been very welcoming. I knew no English; they had very little German, and I do not remember how we communicated in those early days. They sent me to a local school and within weeks I must have absorbed enough English to pass muster in end-of-term exams. </p> <p>The Infields wanted me to be part of their family. They were less than enthused when my mother turned up. Her job was in Surrey; her employers were not prepared to have me live there. So I visited her and peppered her with postcards. It could have developed into a tug of war for my loyalties, as happened to many Kindertransport children whose real parents survived the war. Fortunately in my case, the separation was brief. My mother soon found herself a new job as a cook. Theo Chorley was a professor at the London School of Economics. He hankered after home-made apfelstrudel - my mother's forte.

Their three children became family to me. </p> <p>Thanks to the Chorleys' intervention, Fairfield School gave me a non-fee-paying place. But they returned to London, and my mother had to find another job. This time it was a family with a house bordering on Lake Windermere.

      "bodyText": "Small children romping in a park; smiling mothers watching their carefree offspring. The opening shots of Into the Arms of Strangers - the new documentary about Kindertransport, which had its royal premiere last week - look almost interchangeable with the handful of photographs I have of myself in pre-Hitler Vienna. At the time, it seemed so settled, so normal, so like the life of countless middle-class children growing up in comfortable circumstances in central Europe. But for the Jewish families among them, even if they saw themselves as wholly assimilated into Austrian society, it turned out to be illusory. Two years later Austria had become a distant memory for me. A Kindertransport - a trainload of children whose parents had to be left behind - had brought me to safety but had muddled my sense of identity. I was in Britain, the country that had recognised me as a \"refugee from Nazi oppression\", but which nevertheless ranked even a child as an \"enemy alien\", a potential fifth column capable of undermining the war effort. My photographs of the war years show a sturdy child walking in the Lakeland, or in school uniform with my class at the Fairfield School, a private girls' school in Ambleside, Cumbria. A stranger studying my two sets of photographs - before and after leaving Vienna - might think that, chameleon-like, I had changed persona smoothly and made the cultural transition without undue disturbance. In fact, 60 years on, I am still trying to work out how my life, my way of thinking, my relationships and attitudes, my character, have been affected by having been uprooted from my native environment. Part of me believes it has been a successful transplant and that Britishness has become a second skin. But part of me also thinks I am fundamentally rootless - \"cosmopolitan\" has a more positive ring to it - and in recent times yet another part of me wonders whether it is possible to be both anglicised and to recapture an affinity with Austria. All of me, however, is convinced that every individual has a different way of dealing with hurt, but that refugees have one factor in common: in some - often imperceptible - way, they remain damaged goods. The Kindertransport added a unique phenomenon to refugeedom. Britain agreed in 1938 to take in unaccompanied Jewish children from Germany and Austria on condition that they would be found homes and not become a burden on the state. Their parents, unable to obtain visas for themselves and aware that the Nazis were closing in, preferred to send the children to safety, even if it meant breaking up the family. It was almost impossible to make the young understand that it was for their own good, and that they were not being rejected by their parents. Into the Arms of Strangers gives a bird's eye view of the effect of Kindertransport on the lives of a handful of refugees. I can identify with some of these, first and foremost the fact that everybody stresses their quick absorption of the English language coupled with a rejection of their native tongue, German.

The nebulous concept that is \"power\" is given a vivid, if indirect, illumination; and \"power\" is such an important by-product in Hollywood.

When Vanity Fair published its annual collection of star portraits a few years back it was entitled \"The Power and the Glamour of the Movies\". And the director, whose executive control of a movie is at least notionally invested with some sort of artistic vision, is a figure in whom the deference to power can be made to look like connoisseurship - as well as providing an excitingly gossipy almanac to who's in, who's out, who's going to get the best table at Morton's. </p> <p>So Spielberg is in pole position, with a perfect 100: a further vindication of what Bedazzled director Harold Ramis wrote in this newspaper two weeks ago about the Spielberg Factor depriving other directors of their will to live.

Scorsese, currently having to deal with Leonardo DiCaprio on location for Gangs of New York, is not an obvious banker, and it's a little surprising to see the man who described himself as an \"in-spite-of-Hollywood director\" given this kind of plaudit. Heartening, of course, that the Top 10 contains one real genius of what could be called American art-house cinema. But did those key voting industry players really think that Scorsese is a safer financial bet than John Woo, Ridley Scott and Robert Zemeckis - Numbers seven, eight and nine respectively? Scorsese, whose last effort was the dull Bringing Out the Dead and before that the sluggish Kundun? </p> <p>Well, this is possibly a noble gesture of faith in Scorsese's genius and a thumbing of the nose to the bean-counters.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Andrew Pulver: What motivated you to want to get involved in movies in the first place?</strong> </p> <p> Christopher McQuarrie: While I was a voracious movie-goer as a boy, I never put writing and films together in my mind. I was writing from the time I was 12 years old, but I originally wanted to be a novelist. Bryan Singer [director of The Usual Suspects] was a schoolmate of mine and was making films from a very young age - determined to be a director. He had read a lot of my writing in high school and I had even given him a short story to adapt into a screenplay, but that was as close as I had ever gotten to writing for film. Years later, Bryan called me when he was just out of film school and asked if I would write the script to his first feature. Until then, I had never really taken the thought of a career in film seriously. </p> <p> <strong> Was scriptwriting always your thing, or was it a route to directing?</strong> </p> <p> I honestly never wanted to direct. It was only when I started to work on Alexander the Great that I realised I had to direct. I saw something so specifically in my mind, I could not leave it to someone else. But I will always think of myself as a writer first and foremost. I think it shows in the way I direct - for better or worse. </p> <p> <strong> A biopic of Alexander the Great has always been your unrealised \"dream project\". Why does he appeal to you?</strong> </p> <p> The size. The scope. The fact that a character that unique has never been properly brought to life in film. I especially love the notion that he had conquered most of the known world in his 20s. </p> <p> <strong> Can you describe the way it was received when you pitched it?</strong> </p> <p> Oh, people love the pitch. Everyone wants to see the movie. Its just that no one wants to make it. The way I like to describe Hollywood today is this: everyone wants to make Deliverance, but no one wants to be Ned Beatty. </p> <p> <strong> Can you describe what sort of shape Alexander the Great: The Movie would have taken?</strong> </p> <p> I could have told you that a year ago. Directing has completely changed the way I write and watch films. My vision of Alexander has been completely blown apart. I am starting all over from scratch. Knowledge is death in my experience. The more I know about film, the harder it is to create freely. </p> <p> <strong> Gladiator managed to make a huge success of a classical epic. Did it change the way your pitch was viewed by the studios?</strong> </p> <p> Gladiator only cemented that fact that Alexander has no lasting villain and no traditional love story. Alexander is an epic film wrapped around an intimate internal struggle with a love story between two men. Try selling that to Warner Bros. </p> <p> <strong> Was The Way of the Gun simply a more acceptable type of movie? A \"one for them\" kind of thing?</strong> </p> <p> On the contrary. No one would let me make what I wanted to make, but everyone was willing to let me run with a crime film. We knew no one would try to tell us what to do with the genre based on Suspects. So I ran with it. The Way of the Gun was a response to the tired notion of the traditionally \"sympathetic\" characters. We had met a lot of resistance on Alexander. We had the audacity to create a character with three dimensions and actual flaws. Studios were extremely resistant to that sort of thing. Every scene had to be positive. The audience had to be able to \"identify\" with the character - whatever that means. </p> <p> The characters of Parker [Ryan Phillippe] and Longbaugh [Benicio Del Toro] were designed to violate the canon of the sympathetic protagonist. They were also presented in a film that would deny the audience the cinematic clues that told you who to root for. The film demands that you make those decisions for yourself. I am not interested in telling you what to think. My job is to show you what I think. Period. We never even bothered taking it to the studios. We went to five independents and only Artisan responded. Everyone else hated what we were saying and how we had chosen to say it. No one wanted to make a movie that took the fun out of violence. </p> <p> <strong> Was it written with the actors in mind?</strong> </p> <p> It was certainly written with Benicio in mind. He was the one who told me if I made a crime film, I could do what I wanted to do. I was very resistant to Ryan as Parker, but he would not take no for an answer. Producer Ken Kokin reminded me that the one actor I didn't want in The Usual Suspects was Del Toro. I cast Ryan based purely on the fact that he was the only actor we met who had the balls to do the role. I had drastically underestimated him and - in hindsight - had overestimated the actor I originally had in mind. </p> <p> <strong> What were your principal inspirations for the screenplay?</strong> </p> <p> The films of John Ford, John Huston, John Sturges and Sidney Lumet. Even at their most melodramatic, they are films that have an inherent reality - or at least an honesty - that I admire. I suppose that is the word I should be using instead of reality. Honesty. We wanted to make something honest. We also had a deep hatred for what the system had done to storytelling in the name of political correctness. I wanted to make a film in which violence was not a justified or qualified act. I wanted to make a film that was difficult to watch. I wanted to make a film about violence and criminals that had to be endured rather than something that entertained without consequence. Unfortunately, very few people in this country were in the mood to endure it. </p> <p> <strong> Did you have to persuade anybody to let you direct it?</strong> </p> <p> Artisan was very interested in working with first time directors and building relationships. They seemed to have no issue with my directing the film. </p> <p> <strong> How much of a credit line did you get from writing The Usual Suspects?</strong> </p> <p> Hard to say. Whatever credit I had is exhausted after this film. No one will give me the freedom Artisan did ever again. </p> <p> <strong> Has its success dogged your steps to any extent?</strong> </p> <p> Success is never bad in Hollywood. It is what you do with success that will dog you. Time will tell if this film will dog me or not. </p> <p> <strong> What other thoughts on the movie business do you want to get off your chest?</strong> </p> <p> The Way of the Gun is nothing if not an allegory for my struggles in Hollywood. It's all in there. You just have to listen.</p>",

He disembarks with a few friends. His premonition comes true. That's just the start of Final Destination, a teen horror film from a director and co-writer who have worked on The X Files and Millennium. You probably won't have heard of anyone in the cast, but it shouldn't be ignored. </p> <p>The plane crash is joltingly well done - you wouldn't want to watch it in mid-air - and it's played with conviction. After his narrow escape, our hero (Devon Sawa) works out that death has a plan and wonders: \"If you can figure out the design, can you cheat death?\" But the other \"lucky\" survivors keep meeting grisly ends in a modern variant on the old dark house plot. These are entertainingly done with a strong feeling for the cause and effect of an \"accident\". Demonic special effects dominate too much towards an enjoyable ending.</p> <p> It is self-referential enough for the Scream crowd, too: the characters are named after horror icons, there's a creepy appearance from Candyman's Tony Todd, and a running musical theme by plane crash victim John Denver. The DVD is \"one of the most advanced ever\" says EV. </p> <p><strong> The Whole Nine Yards</strong><br> Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99) <br> Warner Cert 15<br> *** <br> </p> <p> Another example of the current trend for mixing up mobsters and regular Joes. In this case your suburban identification figure is dentist Matthew Perry, who finds retired hitman Bruce Willis moving in next door. Director Jonathan Lynn keeps ringing the plot switches pleasingly without ever making anything believable. It's as daft as a duvet full of duck-billed platypuses but quite fun if you're in the mood, though the acting styles are all over the place. </p> <p>Willis is nicely relaxed, Amanda Peet brightens it up with a fresh and funky turn as a hit woman masquerading as a dental assistant, and Rosanna Arquette is fun as Perry's murderous slut wife. But Perry overdoes the bumbling innocent horribly and makes a very dull couple when he hooks up with Natasha Henstridge, as Willis's estranged ex. </p> <p><strong> Beowulf</strong><br> Rental EV Cert 15 <br> ** <br> </p> <p> Not a Beowulf Seamus Heaney would recognise. Christopher Lambert glares and whispers as a swordsman in a castle fighting a nameless evil thing, which turns out to look like the Creature from the Black Lagoon, to a heavy metal soundtrack. Rhona Mitra's costumes turn it into Beowatch. More hysterical than historical.</p>",

He disembarks with a few friends. His premonition comes true. That's just the start of Final Destination, a teen horror film from a director and co-writer who have worked on The X Files and Millennium. You probably won't have heard of anyone in the cast, but it shouldn't be ignored. The plane crash is joltingly well done - you wouldn't want to watch it in mid-air - and it's played with conviction. After his narrow escape, our hero (Devon Sawa) works out that death has a plan and wonders: \"If you can figure out the design, can you cheat death?\" But the other \"lucky\" survivors keep meeting grisly ends in a modern variant on the old dark house plot. These are entertainingly done with a strong feeling for the cause and effect of an \"accident\". Demonic special effects dominate too much towards an enjoyable ending. It is self-referential enough for the Scream crowd, too: the characters are named after horror icons, there's a creepy appearance from Candyman's Tony Todd, and a running musical theme by plane crash victim John Denver. The DVD is \"one of the most advanced ever\" says EV. The Whole Nine Yards Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99) Warner Cert 15 *** Another example of the current trend for mixing up mobsters and regular Joes. In this case your suburban identification figure is dentist Matthew Perry, who finds retired hitman Bruce Willis moving in next door. Director Jonathan Lynn keeps ringing the plot switches pleasingly without ever making anything believable. It's as daft as a duvet full of duck-billed platypuses but quite fun if you're in the mood, though the acting styles are all over the place. Willis is nicely relaxed, Amanda Peet brightens it up with a fresh and funky turn as a hit woman masquerading as a dental assistant, and Rosanna Arquette is fun as Perry's murderous slut wife. But Perry overdoes the bumbling innocent horribly and makes a very dull couple when he hooks up with Natasha Henstridge, as Willis's estranged ex. Beowulf Rental EV Cert 15 ** Not a Beowulf Seamus Heaney would recognise. Christopher Lambert glares and whispers as a swordsman in a castle fighting a nameless evil thing, which turns out to look like the Creature from the Black Lagoon, to a heavy metal soundtrack. Rhona Mitra's costumes turn it into Beowatch. More hysterical than historical.",

Ministers have ordered that all four to six-year-olds should be offered free fruit by 2004 as part of a campaign to increase children's daily intake of fruit and vegetables. Nutrition surveys have found that one in five children eat no fruit in a week and those that do eat just two portions of fruit and veg a day.</p> <p>Evidence suggests eating five portions a day could cut deaths from heart disease, strokes and cancer by about a fifth. It can also help fight asthma, which now affects one in seven children. But children from poor families are only half as likely to eat fruit as other youngsters.</p> <p>The public health minister, Yvette Cooper, said: \"Access to healthy food is limited, especially in low income areas. Inequalities are reflected in health, as people on low incomes are three times more likely to die early from heart disease than those from professional backgrounds.\"</p> <p>The scheme, which will cost \u00a32m this year, is seen as the most important child nutrition programme since the introduction of free school milk after the second world war.</p> <p>Next year, compulsory nutritional standards, abandoned in the 1980s, are being reintroduced for school lunches. Fruit and vegetables will have to be on offer daily.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The biggest programme in 50 years to improve children's eating habits and health was formally launched yesterday as infant and nursery school pupils began receiving free fruit from the government. Apples, bananas, pears and satsumas are being provided to 35 schools in London and the Midlands with hundreds more becoming involved next term. Ministers have ordered that all four to six-year-olds should be offered free fruit by 2004 as part of a campaign to increase children's daily intake of fruit and vegetables. Nutrition surveys have found that one in five children eat no fruit in a week and those that do eat just two portions of fruit and veg a day. Evidence suggests eating five portions a day could cut deaths from heart disease, strokes and cancer by about a fifth. It can also help fight asthma, which now affects one in seven children. But children from poor families are only half as likely to eat fruit as other youngsters. The public health minister, Yvette Cooper, said: \"Access to healthy food is limited, especially in low income areas. Inequalities are reflected in health, as people on low incomes are three times more likely to die early from heart disease than those from professional backgrounds.\" The scheme, which will cost \u00a32m this year, is seen as the most important child nutrition programme since the introduction of free school milk after the second world war. Next year, compulsory nutritional standards, abandoned in the 1980s, are being reintroduced for school lunches. Fruit and vegetables will have to be on offer daily.",

      "bodyText": "Prime Minister Tony Blair made an \"unashamedly pro-science\" speech when he addressed a biotechnology conference in London today. In the speech, Mr Blair was stressing the importance of investing in science and assuring the biotechnology industry of the Government's support. He told scientists, investors and industry executives that biotechnology could be to the 21st century what computers were to the last 50 years. And he warned the country that it cannot afford to become anti-science without risking missing out on an industry which could provide huge economic benefits. Mr Blair said it would be \"crazy\" not to back scientific progress, adding: \"Biotechnology is the next wave of the knowledge economy and I want Britain to become its European hub.\" In Europe alone he predicted the industry would employ up to three million people within five years and be worth millions as it catches up with the US. But he also stressed that investment and research must take place within a framework which always puts human and environmental safety first. \"Science without judgment can be dangerous, progress without science is unlikely ever to happen,\" the Prime Minister said. Mr Blair was holding out the prospect of biotechnology changing medicine forever, allowing doctors to move from an emphasis on treatment to an emphasis on prevention. He claimed it will allow medical experts to fight back against epidemics likes Aids and genetic diseases which blight the lives of children. While Britain has led Europe in the field of research it was now time for the country to lead Europe \"in spreading its benefits\". The speech, however, risks a new clash between the Government and environmental groups. There is already unhappiness as the stance taken by Labour over genetically modified food where ministers have been seen being too enthusiastic in their backing of the industry. And new support for biotechnology could raise fears among many that the pressure for progress in the industry is being put ahead of risks to human health at risk or harm the environment.

It is understood that Mr Morgan will be summoned to give evidence to the DTI within the next four weeks. Lawyers acting for Mr Hipwell are insisting that he cannot be called in to give evidence due to ill health. However, inspectors will travel to him if he is deemed too ill to appear. As many as 30 journalists have been questioned so far and there is now little chance that the inquiry will conclude before January. The DTI refused to comment on its investigations.",

He alleges that Mr Haydon was negligent in allowing JREL to charge him overseas tour expenses, including booking agents, accountants and producers. Sir Elton's case is that the \"several millions\" which he paid out in touring expenses should have been borne by JREL under a management agreement. PricewaterhouseCoopers (formerly Price Waterhouse) is accused by Sir Elton of negligence in managing his affairs. Both defendants are contesting the allegations against them. Mr Haydon denies negligence and claims that everything had been done in accordance with management con tract terms and conditions. PricewaterhouseCoopers said that it had looked very carefully at the criticisms made and rejected them and would be asking the judge to rule that the firm's employees had acted according to the highest professional standards. The star said he had a \"perfectly clear\" recollection of an occasion in 1984 in St Tropez when he and Mr Reid finally sorted out their management agreement after a lengthy period of \"haggling\". Part of that agreement, he insisted, was that JREL should bear touring costs.

      "body": "<p>The hesitation and wavering of the three local officials who make up the Palm Beach canvassing board looked likely yesterday to cost Al Gore dearly in the post-electoral battle over ballots.</p> <p>The canvassing board, whose job is to oversee elections in the county, voted in the early hours of Sunday morning to authorise a full recount of the 46,000 votes cast across Palm Beach in the presidential election. As Palm Beach is a majority Democratic county, and as hand recounts have tended to enlarge victory margins, such a recount could swing the historically close election in favour of Mr Gore.</p> <p>However, on Tuesday the board suspended the count to await guidance on whether it was legal. Then it voted to restart it. On Wednesday it changed tack again and suspended the count amid confusion about its legal position and how the votes should be tallied.</p> <p>By yesterday, every lost hour was a blow to Al Gore's hopes of eroding George W Bush's 300-vote lead following the automated count. \"We have to start counting. We have to be counting by Friday,\" said one Democrat official.</p> <p>The issue is one of timing. On Tuesday night, Katherine Harris, the Florida secretary of state, certified Florida's vote and Mr Bush's 300-vote lead. At midnight tonight, or at the latest tomorrow morning, she is due to add in the absentee ballot sent in by Floridians living overseas, and certify the final Florida result, assigning its 25 votes in the electoral college, and therefore determining the election.</p> <p>Most political analysts believe that the roughly 2,000 absentee ballots will be either evenly split or lean slightly to Governor Bush.</p> <p>If there is still a manual recount under way at the time of Ms Harris's announcement, the Democrats will be able to portray her decision as premature and politically motivated.</p> <p>Broward County began its recount and by yesterday was showing a slight but significant tilt towards Mr Gore.</p> <p>But Palm Beach waited, and that hesitation may well cost the vice-president vital momentum, despite the fact that all three members of the Palm Beach canvassing board are registered Democrats.</p> <p>The reasons for the delay have been a combination of legal confusion and mixed allegiances.</p> <p>The board was given conflicting guidance by Ms Harris and Florida's attorney general, Bob Butterworth - a Democrat who argued that the county had every right to work out how to run its own elections. Late on Wednesday, Mr Butterworth's position was backed by the Florida supreme court, and yet the board still did not begin the recount.</p> <p>The board was under intense pressure not to commit government officials to a week-long recount which might not even be eligible.</p> <p>The board chairman, Charles Burton, is registered as a Democrat, but was appointed a judge at the end of a long legal career, by Mr Bush's brother, Jeb, the Florida governor. The second member of the board, Carol Roberts, is a county commissioner and a committed Democrat.</p> <p>She drove the board towards its initial decision to hold a recount, but her dominance of the board appears to have waned over the past few days.</p> <p>She said she had received telephone threats. There was also an attempt to unseat her on Wednesday on charges of tampering with ballots, which she denies.</p> <p>The key swing vote on the board has been the tragic figure of Theresa LePore, who designed the infamous \"butterfly ballot\".</p> <p>Apparently eager to avoid any controversy, she voted at the weekend for a recount, but has voted in every decision since to postpone it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The hesitation and wavering of the three local officials who make up the Palm Beach canvassing board looked likely yesterday to cost Al Gore dearly in the post-electoral battle over ballots. The canvassing board, whose job is to oversee elections in the county, voted in the early hours of Sunday morning to authorise a full recount of the 46,000 votes cast across Palm Beach in the presidential election. As Palm Beach is a majority Democratic county, and as hand recounts have tended to enlarge victory margins, such a recount could swing the historically close election in favour of Mr Gore. However, on Tuesday the board suspended the count to await guidance on whether it was legal. Then it voted to restart it. On Wednesday it changed tack again and suspended the count amid confusion about its legal position and how the votes should be tallied. By yesterday, every lost hour was a blow to Al Gore's hopes of eroding George W Bush's 300-vote lead following the automated count. \"We have to start counting. We have to be counting by Friday,\" said one Democrat official. The issue is one of timing. On Tuesday night, Katherine Harris, the Florida secretary of state, certified Florida's vote and Mr Bush's 300-vote lead. At midnight tonight, or at the latest tomorrow morning, she is due to add in the absentee ballot sent in by Floridians living overseas, and certify the final Florida result, assigning its 25 votes in the electoral college, and therefore determining the election. Most political analysts believe that the roughly 2,000 absentee ballots will be either evenly split or lean slightly to Governor Bush. If there is still a manual recount under way at the time of Ms Harris's announcement, the Democrats will be able to portray her decision as premature and politically motivated. Broward County began its recount and by yesterday was showing a slight but significant tilt towards Mr Gore. But Palm Beach waited, and that hesitation may well cost the vice-president vital momentum, despite the fact that all three members of the Palm Beach canvassing board are registered Democrats. The reasons for the delay have been a combination of legal confusion and mixed allegiances. The board was given conflicting guidance by Ms Harris and Florida's attorney general, Bob Butterworth - a Democrat who argued that the county had every right to work out how to run its own elections. Late on Wednesday, Mr Butterworth's position was backed by the Florida supreme court, and yet the board still did not begin the recount. The board was under intense pressure not to commit government officials to a week-long recount which might not even be eligible. The board chairman, Charles Burton, is registered as a Democrat, but was appointed a judge at the end of a long legal career, by Mr Bush's brother, Jeb, the Florida governor. The second member of the board, Carol Roberts, is a county commissioner and a committed Democrat. She drove the board towards its initial decision to hold a recount, but her dominance of the board appears to have waned over the past few days. She said she had received telephone threats. There was also an attempt to unseat her on Wednesday on charges of tampering with ballots, which she denies. The key swing vote on the board has been the tragic figure of Theresa LePore, who designed the infamous \"butterfly ballot\". Apparently eager to avoid any controversy, she voted at the weekend for a recount, but has voted in every decision since to postpone it.",

The US wanted to use the power of its dollar to buy its way out of cuts at home. It is the construction of this market which has led to four years of wrangling and obfuscating negotiations which could yet scupper agreement. The process has long since left all but the most ardent environmentalists confused. All along, Europe knew better.

      "bodyText": "Katherine Harris, immaculately attired and thin-lipped as ever, swept into the basement of the 22-storey Florida Capitol building yesterday to apply her mind to the great issues of the day. These are: how the state's property tax should be administered; new appointments to a community college board; and whether $57,799.55 is a reasonable demand for a company's five-year lease. Only hours previously Ms Harris, 43, by now easily the best-known secretary of state Florida has had, was on the international stage, throwing another spoke into Al Gore's post-election election campaign. But yesterday, at least for a time, it was back to business as usual for the Republican friend and colleague of the Bush brothers who has been described by Democrats as partisan, a lackey and a commissar. She refuses to accept the results of recounts in three heavily Democratic counties which would probably reverse George W Bush's official 300 vote lead in the state, and intends to announce the winner tomorrow. None of this was on the agenda for yesterday's meeting of Governor Jeb Bush's cabinet of which Ms Harris is a member, fashioning a role for herself over the past two years as a trade and culture envoy. \"The governor is focused on the business of the third-largest state in the nation,\" said Mr Bush's spokeswoman, Katie Baur. \"They're addressing the issues that are important to the people of Florida. These are important issues to the people in this state and that's all that matters.\" That was not all that mattered to the governor, who was supposed to have removed himself from the post-election turmoil because of his fraternal connection. \"She has the responsibility to carry out the law and part of that was that in seven days the ballots had to be certified,\" he said. \"I think she's on solid ground.\" All that remained was for the overseas ballots to be counted. Ms Harris has refused to accept the excuses of the four counties that want to continue with manual recounts, saying that the law would allow that to happen only had the original tally been disrupted by an act of god - such as a hurricane - fraud, or if the ballot machines had broken down. Mr Gore's campaign says she was told by the courts that she could reject the submissions from Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Collier counties only if she had a good reason to do so and that this was not the case. The argument is heading for the Florida supreme court, which was receiving papers from Ms Harris and the Republicans on one side and Florida's attorney-general, Bob Butterworth, on the other, on whether the hand counts should continue. Mr Butterworth headed Mr Gore's campaign in the state . Back at Capitol plaza in Tallahassee, Jeb Bush's cabinet meeting ground on, with satellite broadcast trucks on the streets outside and protesters making their silent daily rounds with placards reading Election Theft Underway and Gore + Daley = Vote Fraud! Some local Republicans believed Ms Harris was not receiving the support to which she was entitled. \"I think she's feeling a little alone,\" said Tom Lee, a member of the state senate. \"Very honestly, I'm concerned our party may be throwing her to the wolves. She doesn't deserve that.\"",

The former Police frontman has joined other wealthy residents of the secluded Wiltshire valley where he lives in an attempt to arrest the expansion of activities at nearby Boscombe Down, a military airfield that lays claim to one of the longest runways in Britain. Using recently introduced human rights legislation the group has launched a pre-emptive legal challenge to the procedure under which the airfield's attempts to become home to the RAF's future strategic tanker fleet will be decided. The group, which includes Earl and Countess of Chichester and the Countess of Iveagh, says the government is acting as judge and jury in the case because the proposed developments are not subject to the normal planning process. Although the site's operator, an agency of the Ministry of Defence, is obliged to consult the local planning authority, the authority's findings are not binding. A public inquiry is at the discretion of the secretary of state. Opponents of the expansion say that with government as landowner and decision maker, the minister cannot be independent or impartial. Sting, using his real name Gordon Sumner, with seven others, has filed an application for a judicial review of the decision making process. Lord Chichester, who has lived in Little Durnford Manor in the tranquil Woodford valley for more than 30 years said that if the development were to go ahead it would make life intolerable for people in the surrounding area. \"It will have a huge impact on the locality and yet the way it is being decided is totally undemocratic.\" Their lawyer, Simon Ricketts, said: \"Article six guarantees a fair hearing in front of an independent and impartial tribunal established by law for anyone whose rights are threatened by a proposal such as this.\" Boscombe Down, near Amesbury, is run by the MoD's defence evaluation and research agency. At present the airfield's main function is evaluating military aircraft. It also trains military test pilots. DERA wants to enable the site to take over from RAF Brize Norton as the station for the RAF's fleet of refuelling and troop-carrying aircraft. The proposed development, including construction of hangars, hostel accommodation and a passenger terminal building, could see the number of flight movements rise from around 40,000 a year to 55,000. DERA, which believes the proposals would provide an additional 500 civilian jobs at the airfield says the additional flights would involve the new generation of quick takeoff whisper jets. But suggestions that they would be \"less impactful\" than the fast jets already tested and evaluated at Boscombe have failed to calm fears.

This suggests there are few days on which women are not capable of becoming pregnant, causing difficulties for those who avoid having sex during what they believe to be their most fertile period of the month. This method is used by 1% of women in Britain, but by a higher proportion of those aged between 30 and 45, in preference to alternatives such as the pill, condoms or inter-uterine devices. But the idea that it is easy to identify six days during the average woman's menstrual cycle when intercourse can result in pregnancy, those leading up to and including ovulation, are challenged in a study published in the British Medical Journal. It concludes that the usual clinical guidance for doctors that the average woman is potentially fertile between days 10 and 17 of their cycle, two weeks before her period, does not take \"striking\" unpredictability into account.

Christina Gold, chief executive of Excel, is a former Avon lady. She is convinced that the bulk of the British public has chosen to remain with BT because of confusion caused by the barrage of leaflets and cold calls from rivals. Excel, which was recently taken over by the Canadian telecom group BCE, will trade in Britain as ETI, to avoid confusion with about 300 UK companies called Excel. It is buying capacity from Energis, the telecom group that strings its backbone network over the National Grid's electricity pylons, and is outsourcing its back office work to an IBM-run call centre in Swindon. Its sales force comprises independent representatives who recruit customers, frequently friends, family and neighbours, and take not only a recruitment bonus but also a share of the telecom revenue generated. They also recruit other people to go out and sell. ETI has signed up 300 representatives and expects to have about 4,000 on the books by Christmas. The initial recruitment drive is being conducted by about 250 Excel representatives who have come from North America The sales package promises competitive local call rates, a 25% saving over BT's standard rates for national calls and a 70% saving for international calls.

Legislation to reclaim some of the 58,000 hectares of vacant land blighting urban areas is likely to be introduced after the general election in a widespread review of the planning system. An urban white paper, hailed as the most comprehensive policy framework of its kind for almost half a century, also promised 12 new public-private sector urban regeneration companies - similar to existing bodies in Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield - and regional centres of excellence to improve the quality of housing design and planning. The first will be created in Manchester and London.

Although the country's population of 49m is expected to rise by 7% in this period, the number of households is projected to rise by 19% because of a growing demand for single-person accommodation. This is due to people living longer, a rise in divorce rate, and more young people staying single.

It lamented that new houses had been built at low densities averaging only 25 units per hectare, compared with up to 40 per hectare in Victorian England and in older suburbs. Other countries did much better, the report said. It warned that the present level of greenfield building threatened the countryside \"and fuels the flow of people away from urban centres towards the edge of cities and beyond\". To reverse the rural drift, the white paper underlined the importance of last week's decision by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to offer developers tax incentives for recycling urban land and buildings. These include abolishing stamp duty on property transactions in poor areas, 100% capital allowances for developers converting space over shops into flats, and a 5% VAT rate - down from the present 17.5% - for people who turn older buildings into flats.

      "body": "<p>The trustees of the British Museum were accused yesterday of \"dereliction of their duty to the building\", and will in effect be fined up to \u00a32m of a promised lottery grant for allowing the south portico of the new Great Court to be built in French instead of Portland stone, and with inferior workmanship.</p> <p>The only consolation for the trustees, and chairman Graham Greene, is that the rest of the \u00a390m Great Court, under its acres of new glass roof designed by Lord Foster, is praised as \"superlative\".</p> <p>Although Sir Neil Cossons, chairman of English Heritage, was sharply critical of the museum yesterday, he has crucially decided that the portico should not be demolished, despite the use of the wrong stone, and the quality of the masonry.</p> <p>His predecessor, Sir Jocelyn Stevens, who retired from English Heritage last March, has repeatedly demanded that the portico be demolished and that Graham Greene resign. \"This is one of the most important buildings in the country. They cannot be allowed to get away with this,\" he told the Guardian last week.</p> <p>The culture secretary, Chris Smith, also issued a statement of barely concealed fury. \"I welcome English Heritage's statement today, especially the recognition - widely accepted - that the Great Court scheme as a whole is of the finest quality. There are, however, serious questions to be answered about the specifics of the south portico.\"</p> <p>He called for the publication in full of the report into the affair by PricewaterhouseCoopers when it is finalised within the next few weeks.</p> <p>The uproar over what the museum hoped would be a millennium triumph to rival Tate Modern, began 18 months ago when an anonymous tipoff revealed that the contractor, Easton Masonry, was supplying cheaper French Anstrude stone, rather than the specified Portland. The two stones are so similar that it took laboratory tests to prove this.</p> <p>The museum's managing director, Suzanna Taverne, has revealed that the museum withheld \u00a3170,000 to make up for the price difference, but claims the trustees could not sue because although Portland was always intended, the contract specified Portland \"or similar\".</p> <p>Ms Taverne was not available for comment yesterday, but has robustly defended the trustees' decision to let construction go ahead.</p> <p>Although the public controversy has centred on the French stone, English Heritage was equally concerned by what it judged inferior masonry and carving - which has been partly, but not entirely, corrected.</p> <p>A museum statement said it welcomed English Heritage's recognition that all feasible remedial work had been done, and promised to monitor the work \"in perpetuity\" in case of future deterioration.</p> <p>The planning authority, Camden council, could still ignore the advice of English Heritage and order demolition, but that is now highly unlikely. Councillors will probably not consider the case until January, a month after the opening.</p> <p>English Heritage has urged the heritage lottery fund to stop the part of the \u00a315.75m grant towards the \u00a390m project which relates to the south portico. A spokeswoman confirmed that over \u00a31.3m had been held back, and is highly unlikely to be paid, although the decision must be confirmed by the trustees next month. The lottery fund also gave \u00a330m, but for other aspects of the scheme.</p> <p>The Guardian was invited to inspect the Great Court, just after the stone of both the portico and the neighbouring walls had been pressure washed. The carving of the portico appeared crisp and dramatic, and the colour a creamy white. It was far brighter than the stone of the surviving porticos, which has weathered for 150 years, but not disturbingly so.</p> <p>The Queen opens the Great Court on December 6.</p>",

The only consolation for the trustees, and chairman Graham Greene, is that the rest of the \u00a390m Great Court, under its acres of new glass roof designed by Lord Foster, is praised as \"superlative\". Although Sir Neil Cossons, chairman of English Heritage, was sharply critical of the museum yesterday, he has crucially decided that the portico should not be demolished, despite the use of the wrong stone, and the quality of the masonry. His predecessor, Sir Jocelyn Stevens, who retired from English Heritage last March, has repeatedly demanded that the portico be demolished and that Graham Greene resign. \"This is one of the most important buildings in the country. They cannot be allowed to get away with this,\" he told the Guardian last week. The culture secretary, Chris Smith, also issued a statement of barely concealed fury. \"I welcome English Heritage's statement today, especially the recognition - widely accepted - that the Great Court scheme as a whole is of the finest quality. There are, however, serious questions to be answered about the specifics of the south portico.\" He called for the publication in full of the report into the affair by PricewaterhouseCoopers when it is finalised within the next few weeks. The uproar over what the museum hoped would be a millennium triumph to rival Tate Modern, began 18 months ago when an anonymous tipoff revealed that the contractor, Easton Masonry, was supplying cheaper French Anstrude stone, rather than the specified Portland. The two stones are so similar that it took laboratory tests to prove this. The museum's managing director, Suzanna Taverne, has revealed that the museum withheld \u00a3170,000 to make up for the price difference, but claims the trustees could not sue because although Portland was always intended, the contract specified Portland \"or similar\". Ms Taverne was not available for comment yesterday, but has robustly defended the trustees' decision to let construction go ahead. Although the public controversy has centred on the French stone, English Heritage was equally concerned by what it judged inferior masonry and carving - which has been partly, but not entirely, corrected. A museum statement said it welcomed English Heritage's recognition that all feasible remedial work had been done, and promised to monitor the work \"in perpetuity\" in case of future deterioration. The planning authority, Camden council, could still ignore the advice of English Heritage and order demolition, but that is now highly unlikely. Councillors will probably not consider the case until January, a month after the opening. English Heritage has urged the heritage lottery fund to stop the part of the \u00a315.75m grant towards the \u00a390m project which relates to the south portico. A spokeswoman confirmed that over \u00a31.3m had been held back, and is highly unlikely to be paid, although the decision must be confirmed by the trustees next month. The lottery fund also gave \u00a330m, but for other aspects of the scheme. The Guardian was invited to inspect the Great Court, just after the stone of both the portico and the neighbouring walls had been pressure washed. The carving of the portico appeared crisp and dramatic, and the colour a creamy white. It was far brighter than the stone of the surviving porticos, which has weathered for 150 years, but not disturbingly so. The Queen opens the Great Court on December 6.",

      "bodyText": "Rail passengers will be offered compensation for the delays and cancellations experienced during the recent crisis but the size of the payout has not yet been agreed, it was announced last night. The promise followed a third meeting between rail industry executives and Tony Blair at Downing Street during which the prime minister emphasised the need for a rapid end to rail chaos and compensation to be arranged as soon as possible. Mr Blair urged the rail executives, who included Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the shadow strategic rail authority and the Railtrack chief executive, Gerald Corbett, to make compensation for season ticket holders a priority during the 80 minute meeting, a Downing Street spokesman said. An announcement from rail operators on a compensation scheme could come as early as next week. Mr Blair was determined to keep the pressure on rail operators over the coming weeks to ensure progress was maintained, the spokesman said. But despite a pledge that working timetables would be in place from next week, passengers were warned they could face continuing delays for the next few months at least. The transport minister, Lord Macdonald, said Railtrack expected the bulk of the re-railing work following the Hatfield crash and the recent floods to be completed by the new year. He said the industry's efforts would concentrate on providing better information for the public, a sustainable timetable by next week, a compensation package to be arranged as soon as possible and confirmation of which services would run at Christmas and the new year. He added that the level of compensation passengers would get for the disruption they had endured was a matter of negotiation which was \"very much for the industry to work out\". There have been fears that large amounts of compensation would be kept by train companies rather than passed on to customers. But Lord Macdonald denied that there had ever been a row over compensation or over new timetables. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Corbett said ensuring the rail network was safe and restoring services as quickly as possible were his two main goals. He confirmed that Railtrack plans to carry out 12 months' worth of rail repairs over the next six weeks, subject to approval by the rest of the rail industry and the health and safety executive. Railtrack has talked to train operators about closing key routes for repairs over the Christmas period ready for the January rush when travellers return to work, he added.",

      "bodyText": "Consumer watchdogs yesterday launched a campaign to cut the cost of branded and designer goods following a survey which shows the UK is one of the most expensive places to shop in the world. The Consumers' Association unveiled its \"cheaper brands\" campaign after research showed basic goods in Britain can sometimes cost almost twice as much as in the US. It is now calling for European trade restrictions, which are blamed for the disparity, to be lifted. The CA argues that the EU's trade mark directive, which effectively forces retailers to import goods from the most expensive suppliers, should be scrapped. It is being backed in its fight by supermarket giants Tesco and Asda, and the Parallel Trade Association, which represents \"grey\" importers who openly flout regulations to find customers a better deal. To back its demands, the association yesterday revealed a list of common Christmas stocking items for which British consumers are paying over the odds. On three of them - a Barbie doll, Calvin Klein boxer shorts and a chart CD - British shops were found to be charging a total of almost \u00a350, com pared with under \u00a333 in the US. Sheila McKechnie, director of the Consumers' Association, said: \"This European law is a smokescreen for price fixing as it is allowing brand owners to charge consumers high prices in the UK and the rest of Europe. \"Our message to the European commission is 'Come on, change this law and give us all a cheaper Christmas'.\" The association wants all governments to press the European commission to change the directive so that traders can import cheaper branded goods from any country and retailers are allowed to undercut prices. Tesco, meanwhile, yesterday announced it was launching a \"grey market\" Christmas list. The supermarket chain is already embroiled in a legal battle with Levi's after it imported the clothing giant's jeans from Mexico, selling them to customers for just \u00a330 a pair. Tesco said it would expand its range of \"grey\" goods to include Pokemon T-shirts, Technics stereos, Polo boxer shorts, and Nina Ricci perfumes.

      "body": "<p>About half all triplets born in the United Kingdom are the result of IVF treatment with three embryos such as that undergone by the Thompsons.</p> <p>That is too many, say experts in the field. Babies are less likely to survive pregnancy, more likely to be born prematurely, and more likely to suffer long-term health problems.</p> <p>The consequences for both the families and the national health bill are serious. The implanting of three embryos is the maximum allowed by law since 1990. In the mid 1990s it was common practice to do just that. Now it is far less so.</p> <p>Technological and medical improvements, and overall increasing success rates, mean that in many cases, it may soon be common to transfer just one embryo . Last January the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, with the blessing of the government, issued new guidance which called for a national move to implanting only two embryos.</p> <p>These could substantially reduce the cost of maternity and neonatal services, and, some have pointed out, free money to invest in more fertility treatment which can cost couples desperate for a child a small fortune. Probably fewer than 10% of couples get all the treatment on the NHS. By the time shared expenses, subsidised drugs or other financial deals are done, this may rise to just under one in five.</p> <p>Much as triplets may be loved, and money may sometimes be no object, splitting affection three ways can be difficult. In total, up to 5,700 live births a year are down to IVF treatment, available in 75 clinics. Figures collected by the human fertilisation and embryology authority have indicated that when two embryos are chosen for implanting from more than four prepared there is about a one in four chance of a live birth.</p> <p>Of these, about one in four will be multiple births, although it is four or five times more likely to be twins than triplets. When three embryos are transferred, the chances of multiple births rise to about one in three.</p> <p>The authority last night said the Sheffield case broke neither the law or its code on transfers. These allowed some clinical freedom but the decision had to be reached with the patient's involvement.</p> <p>Dr Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility Services, and a member of the ethics committee of the British Fertility Society, said decisions on the number of embryos should be reached early in the treatment, which including investigation and counselling, might last more than three months for one attempt. Leaving such decisions, including signed consent forms to the last moment, put far too much emotional strain on prospective mothers.</p> <p>\"A general rule of thumb is that a young woman under 37, say, particularly if she is having her first cycle of IVF and the embryos are of good quality should not have more than two.</p> <p>\"But for an older woman, who has had several unsuccessful cycles and whose embryos are of poorer quality, then most clinics would be more comfortable about transferring three embryos. Older women tend to get multiple pregnancies less frequently.\"</p> <p>In most clinics with good treatment records and practice increasing the number of embryos from two to three had little effect on the pregnancy rate. Some clinics with less good rates might still feel it worth using the extra embryo to \"bump things up\".</p> <p>Once clinics were in a position for the transfer of just one or two embryos to be entirely the norm, and a couple were more confident about their chances of the woman becoming pregnant, \"they will be less keen to load the dice in their favour\". Dr Lockwood added: \"People want one or two babies, not a litter. It is only because IVF is so expensive for most people that they will try to get pregnant however they can.\"</p> <p>But not all triplets could be avoided. \"Mother Nature often insists on having the last laugh. You can just implant two embryos and one will spontaneously twin.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "About half all triplets born in the United Kingdom are the result of IVF treatment with three embryos such as that undergone by the Thompsons. That is too many, say experts in the field. Babies are less likely to survive pregnancy, more likely to be born prematurely, and more likely to suffer long-term health problems. The consequences for both the families and the national health bill are serious. The implanting of three embryos is the maximum allowed by law since 1990. In the mid 1990s it was common practice to do just that. Now it is far less so. Technological and medical improvements, and overall increasing success rates, mean that in many cases, it may soon be common to transfer just one embryo . Last January the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, with the blessing of the government, issued new guidance which called for a national move to implanting only two embryos. These could substantially reduce the cost of maternity and neonatal services, and, some have pointed out, free money to invest in more fertility treatment which can cost couples desperate for a child a small fortune. Probably fewer than 10% of couples get all the treatment on the NHS. By the time shared expenses, subsidised drugs or other financial deals are done, this may rise to just under one in five. Much as triplets may be loved, and money may sometimes be no object, splitting affection three ways can be difficult. In total, up to 5,700 live births a year are down to IVF treatment, available in 75 clinics. Figures collected by the human fertilisation and embryology authority have indicated that when two embryos are chosen for implanting from more than four prepared there is about a one in four chance of a live birth. Of these, about one in four will be multiple births, although it is four or five times more likely to be twins than triplets. When three embryos are transferred, the chances of multiple births rise to about one in three. The authority last night said the Sheffield case broke neither the law or its code on transfers. These allowed some clinical freedom but the decision had to be reached with the patient's involvement. Dr Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility Services, and a member of the ethics committee of the British Fertility Society, said decisions on the number of embryos should be reached early in the treatment, which including investigation and counselling, might last more than three months for one attempt. Leaving such decisions, including signed consent forms to the last moment, put far too much emotional strain on prospective mothers. \"A general rule of thumb is that a young woman under 37, say, particularly if she is having her first cycle of IVF and the embryos are of good quality should not have more than two. \"But for an older woman, who has had several unsuccessful cycles and whose embryos are of poorer quality, then most clinics would be more comfortable about transferring three embryos. Older women tend to get multiple pregnancies less frequently.\" In most clinics with good treatment records and practice increasing the number of embryos from two to three had little effect on the pregnancy rate. Some clinics with less good rates might still feel it worth using the extra embryo to \"bump things up\". Once clinics were in a position for the transfer of just one or two embryos to be entirely the norm, and a couple were more confident about their chances of the woman becoming pregnant, \"they will be less keen to load the dice in their favour\". Dr Lockwood added: \"People want one or two babies, not a litter. It is only because IVF is so expensive for most people that they will try to get pregnant however they can.\" But not all triplets could be avoided. \"Mother Nature often insists on having the last laugh. You can just implant two embryos and one will spontaneously twin.\"",

The bulk of the work on the manifesto analysis has now been completed, overseen by No 10 policy researcher Ed Richards. It is expected that crime and fear of crime, and wider social disorder such as drunkenness and incivility, will play a large part in the manifesto, as well as in the Queen's speech. Ministers believe middle England is beginning to recognose that acute crime is in decline, but more needs to be done to show that the government is on the side of ordinary citizens fed up by drunkenness, graffiti and street intimidation. Strategists believe they need to address the issue of social dislocation partly by developing ideas set out in neighbourhood renewal strategy. They also want to take the New Deal into more difficult areas, including the 1m plus completely out of touch from the labour market. Ministers plan to use the Queens speech in a fortnight's time and a raft of green papers, including one on the family and another on work-life balance, to show that Labour will not run out of energy or ideas in a second term. Party officials are also pinning hopes on the novel thank you campaign - launched with nationwide posters this week in which ordinary citizens are given the credit for the reduction in class sizes and other achievements in the Labour record. They hope the slogan will address the image of an arrogant out of touch leadership whilst stressing the government's achievements. \"We have been struggling to find a vocabulary of achievement that is also humble and this may be the answer,\" said one MP involved in preparing the campaign. The fall in Mr Blair's personal popularity ratings has been the most worrying development for the party in recent months. Some Downing Street strategists believe they will win the coming election easily with a strong message to voters on the economy, on investment in key public services like health and education, and even on Europe where they will contrast their promise of choice on the single currency with Tory isolationism. \"The economy, education, the health service and crime, these themes are enough to keep the 1997 coalition together,\" one No 10 insider predicted. In a reversal of the electoral logic of the 1980s when Thatcherite tax cuts drove the agenda, Labour will campaign on a stable economy plus investment in public services which most voters want.

      "bodyText": "Syria's new president, Bashar al-Assad, has ordered the release of 600 political prisoners to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the purge that brought his father Hafez to power. The amnesty is believed to include members of the banned Muslim Brothers, the Communist Action League and other parties. Some of the detainees are said to be Lebanese. \"This is an encouraging first step towards the release of all political prisoners in the country,\" a spokesman for Amnesty International said. Amnesty estimated that Syria had between 1,000 and 1,500 political prisoners before the releases were announced. Since inheriting the presidency after the death in June of his father, Bashar, 35, has been pushing for a degree of political and economic reform in what was widely regarded as a hidebound police state. The release of prisoners commemorated November 16, 1970, when the \"Corrective Movement\" purged its rivals in the Ba'ath party and Hafez al-Assad seized the presidency. Patrick Seale, biographer of the late leader, said yesterday: \"Dr Bashar is anxious to improve Syria's human rights image. Shortly after taking over he set up a committee to visit jails and examine cases. \"He also wants to heal the wounds of the past, especially with the Muslim Brothers.\" Many of the Brothers were arrested in the 1980s during a suppression which included the 1982 massacre at the town of Hama. Under Syrian law, membership of the Muslim Brothers is still a capital crime. The release of about 100 Lebanese political prisoners is also seen as a goodwill gesture towards Lebanon, where Syria maintains 20,000 or more troops. Opposition to this military presence has been growing recently. Many Lebanese see no justification for it now that the Israeli army has withdrawn from the south.",

The countries who had wanted to establish it in order to show they were doing something about the Balkan crisis did not want it to become genuinely operational and for a long time gave it no money, no intelligence, and no help in arresting suspects.

Arbour, for example, upset the Americans by indicting Slobodan Milosevic, who feared it might make negotiating with him more difficult, toward the end of the Kosovo war. The arrival in power of two foreign ministers, Madeleine Albright and Robin Cooke, who were strongly in favour of the tribunal, helped make it into a real force.</p> <p>The difficulty now is balancing the need to help Vojislav Kostunica consolidate himself in Serbia with the need to pursue Milosevic and other indicted men in that country, and to gain the access to the documents and the witnesses allowing the indictment of many more in all parts of former Yugoslavia.

It may be that the Milosevic forces will do better because he and others are still in the country.

As tonight's midnight deadline neared for the potentially decisive overseas postal votes to be received by election officials in each Florida county, Al Gore and George W Bush continued to battle one another down to the wire in a series of legal confrontations that could keep the White House in play. Yesterday Mr Gore's lawyers launched an assault on three fronts in their efforts to keep the counting process alive beyond tomorrow, when the Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris, has said she intends to add the results from the overseas votes to the totals she has already certified and declare what she hopes will be the final outcome of the November 7 election. Overseas votes have been trickling in to each of Florida's 67 counties since the election. Estimates of the number available for counting after the midnight deadline vary, but most observers think between 2,200 and 3,000 ballot papers are involved - papers which could tip the balance in the contest for Florida's decisive 25 electoral college votes. Reports yesterday suggested that no more than a quarter of the postal votes, around 500, were from voters in the armed services, a smaller percentage than previously been predicted. Mr Bush begins the day with a 300-vote margin over Mr Gore in the official count approved by Ms Harris, and is hoping that a traditional Republican advantage in the overseas vote tally will extend his lead still further, perhaps forcing Mr Gore to give in. But Mr Gore showed little sign of throwing in his hand, taking to the airwaves for a second successive day to tell radio listeners that the choice in the impasse \"is whether the voters are going to decide this election or whether the process is going to be short-circuited\". Mr Gore's lawyers were just as trenchant, telling the Florida supreme court in a submission to keep recounts going that it was essential the winner in Florida \"actually was the choice of Florida's voters\". \"Whatever happens in this court, the ballots cast in Florida will be counted. Historians will count them. The tragedy for our democracy will be if the count reveals that on January 20 2001 the United States swore in the wrong candidate because the secretary of state stopped local canvassing boards from counting votes,\" Mr Gore's submission said.

In a separate legal move, lawyers for the two sides submitted more than 400 pages of written arguments to a federal appeals court in Atlanta in an appeal by Mr Bush against a decision by a federal judge in Miami not to intervene to stop the recounts. A ruling is not expected before today at the earliest. Palm Beach county, where the election results were most hotly contested, remained in limbo yesterday, ready to begin a recount of its 460,000 votes, but without clear guidance on whether it could. With an order from Ms Harris not to proceed followed by a finding from the state's attorney general that the county did have the right to hold a recount, Palm Beach's three-member canvassing board sat on its hands yesterday awaiting the definitive ruling from the state supreme court in Tallahassee. Meanwhile, Broward county continued its own recount despite the legal confusion and early figures suggested a very slight tilt towards Mr Gore.

The move comes more than a year after former president Slobodan Milosevic cut ties at the start of Nato's 78-day air offensive, launched after Belgrade's crackdown on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. Since Mr Milosevic was forced from power after the September 24 election, Yugoslavia has rejoined the UN - after eight years in the wilderness - and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Mr Kostunica has also attended an EU summit and held talks with several world leaders. President Bill Clinton's Balkans envoy, James O'Brien, discussed restoring relations during talks in Belgrade on Wednesday. But Mr O'Brien said substantial US aid would only follow if Yugoslavia cooperated with the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague. He confirmed that Congress was ready to approve $100m (\u00a369m) for Serbia and $89m (\u00a362m) for Montenegro. Mr Kostunica has balked at efforts to send Mr Milosevic and a handful of his loyalists to stand trial in the Hague, but said they may face prosecution in Yugoslavia. Yesterday the Yugoslav foreign minister, Goran Svilanovic, said that his government would allow the tribunal to work in Yugoslavia. He made no mention, however, of any change in Mr Kostunica's position on Mr Milosevic or anyone else wanted by the tribunal.

The British trade minister, Richard Caborn, visited the country last week. Since coming to power, Mr Kostunica has moved quickly to end Belgrade's international isolation. He addressed the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, clearly stating his wish for Yugoslavia to join the EU. Last Tuesday, Belgrade hosted a two-day meeting of the stability pact for south-eastern Europe, which also recently opened its doors to Mr Kostunica's administration. The renewal of diplomatic relations comes as US diplomat Richard Holbrooke hosts a conference of Balkan leaders today in Dayton, Ohio, marking the fifth anniversary of the Dayton peace accords which ended the war in Bosnia. On the agenda is the next phase of the Dayton agreement, as well as the future status of Kosovo and Montenegro.

      "body": "<p>A couple who had triplets after fertility treatment won an unprecedented compensation claim yesterday against the clinic which gave them three babies instead of the hoped-for one or two.</p> <p>Patricia and Peter Thompson sued the Sheffield fertility centre for breach of contract after the triplets, two boys and a girl, were born through in vitro fertilisation in March 1997.</p> <p>The exhausting task of looking after three babies forced the couple, from Thrybergh, south Yorkshire, to give up the family news agency business and put a huge strain on their resources, they told the high court in Sheffield.</p> <p>The couple signed an agreement at their initial consultation in 1996 that two embyros would be implanted. But the clinic told the court that Mrs Thompson had later agreed verbally with the doctor performing the procedure that three should be inserted to give a better chance of success.</p> <p>Mr Justice Hooper accepted the Thompsons' evidence and ruled that the fertility clinic had breached its contract with the couple. \"For reasons that I shall give later, the claimant has shown on the balance of probabilities that she did not agree to the replacement of three embryos,\" he said.</p> <p>The Thompsons, who are on legal aid, were claiming compensation for lost earnings and the cost of raising the third child. They were able to sue for breach of contract because they paid for their IVF treatment, which cost them \u00a31,600. Had they been treated on the NHS, that option would not have been open to them.</p> <p>The law lords ruled last year that parents who have an unwanted child as a result of medical negligence cannot claim the cost of bringing up the child. But they left open the possibility that this might not apply in a breach of contract case. The amount of compensation will be decided at a later hearing.</p> <p>The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority is concerned about the increase in multiple births through fertility treatment, because twins and triplets are more likely to be born prematurely.</p> <p>\"The guidance is to take all possible steps to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancies,\" said Jane Denton of the Multiple Births Society. \"The key thing is that it is discussed fully with the parents.\"</p> <p>Mrs Thompson said the paediatrician looking after the newborn triplets said: \"This should not have happened.\"</p> <p>The IVF expert Lord Winston said: \"This is not a criticism of the Sheffield unit, but our policy for the last 14 years has been to transfer only two embryos at the Hammersmith. But we are unusual. Most clinics don't agree with such a rigid policy. It does mean we have a lower success rate.\"</p> <p>Mr Thompson, 57, has three grown-up children from a previous marriage. He and his wife, now 34, tried IVF after attempting unsuccessfully for five years to have a child.</p> <p>Mrs Thompson said she learned that three embryos had been implanted only after the 10-minute procedure.</p> <p>She said: \"I think two is more than enough for anyone to have, I just wanted two babies or a baby.\" In 1998, she unexpectedly conceived a fourth baby, a daughter, naturally.</p> <p>She said: \"I am delighted with our children, who are fit and healthy, but the effort of looking after three children rather than the maximum of two that we had planned is absolutely exhausting and stretches our physical resources.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A couple who had triplets after fertility treatment won an unprecedented compensation claim yesterday against the clinic which gave them three babies instead of the hoped-for one or two. Patricia and Peter Thompson sued the Sheffield fertility centre for breach of contract after the triplets, two boys and a girl, were born through in vitro fertilisation in March 1997. The exhausting task of looking after three babies forced the couple, from Thrybergh, south Yorkshire, to give up the family news agency business and put a huge strain on their resources, they told the high court in Sheffield. The couple signed an agreement at their initial consultation in 1996 that two embyros would be implanted. But the clinic told the court that Mrs Thompson had later agreed verbally with the doctor performing the procedure that three should be inserted to give a better chance of success. Mr Justice Hooper accepted the Thompsons' evidence and ruled that the fertility clinic had breached its contract with the couple. \"For reasons that I shall give later, the claimant has shown on the balance of probabilities that she did not agree to the replacement of three embryos,\" he said. The Thompsons, who are on legal aid, were claiming compensation for lost earnings and the cost of raising the third child. They were able to sue for breach of contract because they paid for their IVF treatment, which cost them \u00a31,600. Had they been treated on the NHS, that option would not have been open to them. The law lords ruled last year that parents who have an unwanted child as a result of medical negligence cannot claim the cost of bringing up the child. But they left open the possibility that this might not apply in a breach of contract case. The amount of compensation will be decided at a later hearing. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority is concerned about the increase in multiple births through fertility treatment, because twins and triplets are more likely to be born prematurely. \"The guidance is to take all possible steps to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancies,\" said Jane Denton of the Multiple Births Society. \"The key thing is that it is discussed fully with the parents.\" Mrs Thompson said the paediatrician looking after the newborn triplets said: \"This should not have happened.\" The IVF expert Lord Winston said: \"This is not a criticism of the Sheffield unit, but our policy for the last 14 years has been to transfer only two embryos at the Hammersmith. But we are unusual. Most clinics don't agree with such a rigid policy. It does mean we have a lower success rate.\" Mr Thompson, 57, has three grown-up children from a previous marriage. He and his wife, now 34, tried IVF after attempting unsuccessfully for five years to have a child. Mrs Thompson said she learned that three embryos had been implanted only after the 10-minute procedure. She said: \"I think two is more than enough for anyone to have, I just wanted two babies or a baby.\" In 1998, she unexpectedly conceived a fourth baby, a daughter, naturally. She said: \"I am delighted with our children, who are fit and healthy, but the effort of looking after three children rather than the maximum of two that we had planned is absolutely exhausting and stretches our physical resources.\"",

      "body": "<p>John Prescott paid a welcome visit to the House of Commons yesterday to launch his department's new white paper, Our Towns And Cities: The Future.</p> <p>This is a classic New Labour document, being printed on glossy paper and illustrated with colour pictures of the Elysium which is the new Britain. Happy people, many from ethnic minorities, gaze productively at computer screens. Pensioners get off a gleaming streamlined tram which has just delivered them promptly and inexpensively to their grandchildren.</p> <p>In New Labour's dream world, canals are for strolling by, past bustling pavement cafes where laughing groups of people drink cappuccino in the sun. And they're definitely not full of dead cats, condoms or rusted supermarket trollies.</p> <p>The prose has the same unreal quality. Nothing actually happens, nothing tangible is planned. But, we are promised, there will be \"innovative developments\", \"local strategic partnerships\" and \"urban policy units\".</p> <p>Town councils will have \"new powers to promote wellbeing\". As members of society, people will need to be able \"to achieve their full potential\" while \"protecting the environment, both local and global.\" To make sure this happens, the government's \"policies and programmes are the building blocks,\" and just in case we might think this may never happen, we're promised that \"visions for the future will be developed\".</p> <p>There will be a \"key focus\" here and a \"coordinated effort\" there.

      "bodyText": "John Prescott paid a welcome visit to the House of Commons yesterday to launch his department's new white paper, Our Towns And Cities: The Future. This is a classic New Labour document, being printed on glossy paper and illustrated with colour pictures of the Elysium which is the new Britain. Happy people, many from ethnic minorities, gaze productively at computer screens. Pensioners get off a gleaming streamlined tram which has just delivered them promptly and inexpensively to their grandchildren. In New Labour's dream world, canals are for strolling by, past bustling pavement cafes where laughing groups of people drink cappuccino in the sun. And they're definitely not full of dead cats, condoms or rusted supermarket trollies. The prose has the same unreal quality. Nothing actually happens, nothing tangible is planned. But, we are promised, there will be \"innovative developments\", \"local strategic partnerships\" and \"urban policy units\". Town councils will have \"new powers to promote wellbeing\". As members of society, people will need to be able \"to achieve their full potential\" while \"protecting the environment, both local and global.\" To make sure this happens, the government's \"policies and programmes are the building blocks,\" and just in case we might think this may never happen, we're promised that \"visions for the future will be developed\". There will be a \"key focus\" here and a \"coordinated effort\" there. The government, in its wisdom, has \"established a framework\". The whole thing resembles those fantastical architect's drawings, in which slim, well-dressed figures stroll across tree-festooned piazzas, with no mention of empty burger boxes or gangs of glowering youths. But Mr Prescott's statement, far from being the jumble of words we have come to expect, was an oral version of the same thing. I have noticed that the time to become suspicious about this government is when it breaks into capital letters. This invariably represents not the real world, but some new initiative, programme or quango. He is setting up Regional Centres of Excellence. He has established a Neighbourhood Renewal Fund. He is considering an Urban Policy Board, and a Cabinet Committee is to hold an Urban Summit in the year 2002. Let's not forget the Integrated Transport White Paper, the New Deal for Communities and the Social Exclusion Unit. Capital letters were all over the shop, each in charge of a resonant abstraction. We hacks were abjured yesterday by Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press secretary to mark the difference between scepticism and cynicism. My attitude to Mr Prescott's statement was a balanced mixture of both. At one point, for example, he reminded us that Lord Rogers had said, \"people make cities, but cities make citizens\".

Mr Prescott got confused about the technical terms for a city. \"The city of York already is a city, as is my own city of Hull is a city, and that I think is the definition of city and town.\" Faced with these massive piles of abstract thought, there was little the Tory spokesman, Archie Norman could say or do. \"The only time we ever see the deputy prime minister,\" he grumped, \"is when he has a glossy brochure or a disaster to announce.\" Or, I reflected yesterday, possibly both at the same time.",

Patterson is not, as you might think, a delivery driver for a pizza firm for cannibals (\"So that's a medium four cheeses, with foreskins, spleen and extra tongue.

Rather, he's a doctor whose efforts in ferrying foreskin may determine the fate of millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. </p> <p> <strong> Horizon: The Valley Of Life Or Death</strong> (BBC2) explored the notion that circumcised men were less likely to contract HIV than uncircumcised men. With an impressive array of contributors - from anthropologists and scientists to people with HIV - it managed to convey a frightening amount of scientific information without being overwhelming. And, more importantly, without too many shots of flashing blades and bleeding penises. Apparently, it's all to do with keratin (and you thought that was something only found in shampoos formulated and controlled by Laboratoires Garnier) and the layer it forms on most of the body's skin to protect it from micro-organisms. The foreskin doesn't have much keratin, so HIV can slip into the body much more easily. With circumcision doing away with a foreskin, HIV has a tougher time. Dr Barry Patterson was just one link in a worldwide chain of boffins seeking to establish such a thesis, and his foreskin exploits provided it with considerable support. Yet despite the melodramatic narration (\"For the first time, HIV is being dripped onto a living foreskin!\"), the actual moment of truth wasn't all that exciting. Especially as the foreskin in question was grey, like a bit of putty, leading one to speculate on the colour of the penis to which it was attached. </p> <p>But for someone not particularly interested in science, Horizon was nonetheless intriguing stuff, and a persuasive demonstration of the scientists' and anthropologists' theory. It also gave the views of tribal elders - whose traditions precluded circumcision - a fair hearing. And there were people to despair of as well - members of an anti-circumcision group called NOCIRC. As well as thinking up a super-imaginative name for their organisation, they said dumb things, like the fact that a programme promoting circumcision was \"a scientifically sanctioned holocaust against African males\".

Ken, for example, survived the invasion of Sicily, saw his friends and comrades blown to smithereens, went on to fight at D-Day and hasn't lost his mind. Then there was Hugh, a most collected and beneficent man, who calmly stated that war turned people into beasts so they could fight, before detailing his own atavistic fall.

      "body": "<p>It was a bowhead whale, and it might still be alive today if it hadn't been for a hunter's harpoon. As it is, scientists believe it lived for 211 years - by far the oldest mammal, and perhaps the oldest animal, ever discovered. </p> <p>The extraordinary truth was discovered when the eyes of the ancient whale, one of four dozen of the huge creatures whose remains were frozen after being killed between 1978 and 1996, were sent for analysis by Craig George, a researcher at Alaska's North Slope borough department of wildlife management. </p> <p>Mr George already suspected that bowhead whales could live to be more than two centuries old. Present-day native Inupiat whalers had found stone and ivory harpoon heads from their 19th or 18th century ancestors embedded in the blubber of bowheads they had killed. </p> <p>The breakthrough, reported in the latest edition of New Scientist magazine, came when a biochemist in San Diego, Jeff Bada, discovered a method of working out the age of marine mammals by analysing the decay of proteins in the onion-like layers of the spherical lenses of their eyes. </p> <p>When Professor Bada and another scientist in Seattle, Judy Zeh of the University of Washington, used the new technique to find out how old the frozen whales were when they were killed, they found four males which were aged over 100 and one which was 211 years old. </p> <p>The technique has a margin of error of 25 years. But even if the oldest whale was 186, it would still make it the world's longest-lived mammal species, far older than the previous champions, humankind. </p> <p>The discovery raises troubling issues about the bowhead's vulnerability to extinction. </p> <p>It also provokes profound questions about the nature of ageing in all mammals, a mysterious field beginning to attract increasing attention. </p> <p>Most biologists do not believe wild animals grow old - old age is a phenomenon only seen in protected species such as humans or pet animals. </p> <p>The key to how long an animal lives in the wild is how early it has to breed before something - a predator, disease, cold or famine - kills it. </p> <p><strong> Evolution</strong><br> </p> <p> Animals like mice have evolved a live fast, die young approach. They eat a lot, have sex a lot, have lots of children and have extremely fast heartbeats because 90% of them die in their first year. Nature never needs to worry about designing them to cope with ageing. </p> <p>In the wild, human beings were likely to die in their 30s, after they had reproduced. Nature never invested in repair mechanisms for the 40-plus age group because it wasn't worth it - as far as evolution is concerned, the sabre-toothed tiger should have got us by then. That's why we get old rather than just living longer. </p> <p>But before human hunters came along, bowhead whales seem to have evolved in a world with remarkably few threats. At 80 tonnes, and growing up to 60ft long, they can stand up to any predators in their native waters between Alaska and north-east Russia. </p> <p>They seem to suffer little from disease or parasites. They are so resistant to cold that it is estimated they could stay warm swimming in liquid oxygen. And they take life very slow and easy, meaning they burn less energy, thought to be the process which causes us to age. They sleep a lot, grow slowly, never travel faster than four miles an hour, and have calves only once every four years. </p> <p><strong> Wisdom</strong><br> </p> <p> Over their centuries of life, the bowheads may even acquire wisdom. They move and hunt in groups, singing out warnings about pack ice to each other. </p> <p>\"The older guys are not only bigger, but wiser,\" Charles Krebs, a Vancouver population ecologist, told the New Scientist. \"They know where to look for food and how to avoid predators.\" </p> <p>It is a strategy that served the bowhead well until man came along. There are concerns that the bowhead's long, slow, low-birthrate lifestyle make them exceptionally vulnerable to the loss of even a few animals each year. </p> <p>There were thought to be about 65,000 bowheads before industrial-scale whaling almost rendered them extinct. The end of the mass whaling era has brought a slow recovery in their numbers in the western Arctic, where the 8,000-strong population is growing at about 3% a year, but they still look vulnerable in the east, where the 500 or so survivors are still subject to legal hunting by native peoples. </p> <p><strong> Wild</strong><br> </p> <p> If bowhead whales can live to be 200-plus in the wild, it raises the question of how long they would live if they led the kind of sheltered existence experienced by humans or zoo animals. Humans in the west now expect to live twice as long, on average, as their wild ancestors, and in extreme cases we will live to be four times as old. </p> <p>The oldest known elephant lived to be 81 years old; horses have been said to live to be 60, and crocodiles and spiny anteaters have been reported as living to be over 50. </p> <p>Ageing researchers distinguish between \"lifespan\", the time from birth to death, and \"healthspan\", the period of life when an animal is fully fit. Usually, for humans in the west, lifespan is longer than healthspan, but there is no suggestion that the oldest bowhead whales have the equivalent of wrinkles, Alzheimer's or arthritis. </p> <p>No one has ever found a bowhead whale which died of old age. How old would they be if they reached that point? </p> <p>Mr George responded: \"I think we're going to see bowheads out there on the edge.\" </p> <p> <strong>Slow progress: Tortoise is 170</strong></p> <p>Harriet the giant tortoise celebrated her 170th birthday this week. Harriet was one of three giant tortoises which Darwin imported to Britain from the Galapagos Islands in 1835. He estimated that she was born in around 1830, when William IV ascended the throne and Stephenson's Rocket first began to pull passenger trains. </p> <p>But her professional career as specimen was short-lived. Once Darwin had finished studying her, he packed her off on a convict ship; by the age of 12 she was enjoying early retirement in the Australian sunshine. </p> <p>As all 400lb of her testify, the emigrant thrived in her new home in the Antipodes. But it was only in the 1960s that a sharp-eyed keeper spotted something even Darwin had missed. Harriet, previously identified as a male called Harry, was undeniably female.</p>",

Mr George already suspected that bowhead whales could live to be more than two centuries old. Present-day native Inupiat whalers had found stone and ivory harpoon heads from their 19th or 18th century ancestors embedded in the blubber of bowheads they had killed. The breakthrough, reported in the latest edition of New Scientist magazine, came when a biochemist in San Diego, Jeff Bada, discovered a method of working out the age of marine mammals by analysing the decay of proteins in the onion-like layers of the spherical lenses of their eyes. When Professor Bada and another scientist in Seattle, Judy Zeh of the University of Washington, used the new technique to find out how old the frozen whales were when they were killed, they found four males which were aged over 100 and one which was 211 years old. The technique has a margin of error of 25 years. But even if the oldest whale was 186, it would still make it the world's longest-lived mammal species, far older than the previous champions, humankind. The discovery raises troubling issues about the bowhead's vulnerability to extinction. It also provokes profound questions about the nature of ageing in all mammals, a mysterious field beginning to attract increasing attention. Most biologists do not believe wild animals grow old - old age is a phenomenon only seen in protected species such as humans or pet animals. The key to how long an animal lives in the wild is how early it has to breed before something - a predator, disease, cold or famine - kills it. Evolution Animals like mice have evolved a live fast, die young approach. They eat a lot, have sex a lot, have lots of children and have extremely fast heartbeats because 90% of them die in their first year. Nature never needs to worry about designing them to cope with ageing. In the wild, human beings were likely to die in their 30s, after they had reproduced. Nature never invested in repair mechanisms for the 40-plus age group because it wasn't worth it - as far as evolution is concerned, the sabre-toothed tiger should have got us by then. That's why we get old rather than just living longer. But before human hunters came along, bowhead whales seem to have evolved in a world with remarkably few threats. At 80 tonnes, and growing up to 60ft long, they can stand up to any predators in their native waters between Alaska and north-east Russia. They seem to suffer little from disease or parasites. They are so resistant to cold that it is estimated they could stay warm swimming in liquid oxygen. And they take life very slow and easy, meaning they burn less energy, thought to be the process which causes us to age. They sleep a lot, grow slowly, never travel faster than four miles an hour, and have calves only once every four years. Wisdom Over their centuries of life, the bowheads may even acquire wisdom. They move and hunt in groups, singing out warnings about pack ice to each other. \"The older guys are not only bigger, but wiser,\" Charles Krebs, a Vancouver population ecologist, told the New Scientist. \"They know where to look for food and how to avoid predators.\" It is a strategy that served the bowhead well until man came along. There are concerns that the bowhead's long, slow, low-birthrate lifestyle make them exceptionally vulnerable to the loss of even a few animals each year. There were thought to be about 65,000 bowheads before industrial-scale whaling almost rendered them extinct. The end of the mass whaling era has brought a slow recovery in their numbers in the western Arctic, where the 8,000-strong population is growing at about 3% a year, but they still look vulnerable in the east, where the 500 or so survivors are still subject to legal hunting by native peoples. Wild If bowhead whales can live to be 200-plus in the wild, it raises the question of how long they would live if they led the kind of sheltered existence experienced by humans or zoo animals. Humans in the west now expect to live twice as long, on average, as their wild ancestors, and in extreme cases we will live to be four times as old. The oldest known elephant lived to be 81 years old; horses have been said to live to be 60, and crocodiles and spiny anteaters have been reported as living to be over 50. Ageing researchers distinguish between \"lifespan\", the time from birth to death, and \"healthspan\", the period of life when an animal is fully fit. Usually, for humans in the west, lifespan is longer than healthspan, but there is no suggestion that the oldest bowhead whales have the equivalent of wrinkles, Alzheimer's or arthritis. No one has ever found a bowhead whale which died of old age. How old would they be if they reached that point? Mr George responded: \"I think we're going to see bowheads out there on the edge.\" Slow progress: Tortoise is 170 Harriet the giant tortoise celebrated her 170th birthday this week. Harriet was one of three giant tortoises which Darwin imported to Britain from the Galapagos Islands in 1835. He estimated that she was born in around 1830, when William IV ascended the throne and Stephenson's Rocket first began to pull passenger trains. But her professional career as specimen was short-lived. Once Darwin had finished studying her, he packed her off on a convict ship; by the age of 12 she was enjoying early retirement in the Australian sunshine. As all 400lb of her testify, the emigrant thrived in her new home in the Antipodes. But it was only in the 1960s that a sharp-eyed keeper spotted something even Darwin had missed. Harriet, previously identified as a male called Harry, was undeniably female.",

      "body": "<p>On the wall of the governor's office at Feltham young offenders' institution there are three picture hooks. Normally the governors' roll hangs here - an oak board bearing the names of those who have occupied perhaps the hottest seat in the prison service. On a chill morning earlier this week the hooks were vacant. \"It's down in the workshop having my name added. The paint's not dry yet,\" says Nick Pascoe, the new boss of Britain's most notorious youth prison. From the window, through a thick mist, we can make out the top of the steel-mesh fence crowned with rolled razor wire that marks the boundaries of his estate; 96 acres housing up to 700 of the most disturbed, deprived and dangerous young men in the country.</p> <p>The office may as well have a revolving door. Pascoe, who started three weeks ago, is the fifth man to take the job in the past 18 months. He was tempted back from his job at a private jail by Martin Narey, the director general of the prison service, whose arrival we await. \"I shall tell him I returned the company car this morning,\" Pascoe says with a wry grin. \"That's the ultimate sacrifice, isn't it?\"</p> <p>Having to run his own car will be the least of Pascoe's worries. Within days of the new governor taking up his post a former Feltham prisoner, Robert Stewart, was convicted of murdering his 19-year-old Asian cellmate, Zahid Mubarek. Stewart, a 20-year-old racist psychopath with a cross and the letters RIP tattooed on his forehead, beat Zahid to death with a table leg in their 7ft by 10ft cell in the middle of the night in March. An internal inquiry found that ample evidence of Stewart's racist, violent tendencies and declining mental health had been missed or ignored by prison staff.</p> <p>Stewart's conviction was the latest event in a miserable year for the jail. On a Saturday morning at the end of October, tensions spilled over and officers lost control of a unit housing 60 prisoners. In the four hours it took to regain control, the wing was trashed. In September, Kevin Henson, 16, ended his short, tragic life with a noose hung from an exposed pipe in his cell. Pascoe's task is to turn Feltham around. It will not be easy.</p> <p>Serving every court in London and most of those in the south-east, Feltham is the largest young offenders' institution in the country; it sees 30,000 boys and young men between the age of 15 and 21 pass through its gates every year. Some stay briefly on remand; others are at the start of a long prison career. Feltham is short-staffed, 23-hour-a-day bang-ups are common, morale is low and the institution's reputation stinks. One experienced youth worker dismisses it as \"a finishing school for career criminals\".</p> <p>Pascoe thinks of the place in less absolute terms. \"Some of these men are dangerous and sophisticated criminals; others are totally unsophisticated and very damaged. The public expectation is that if you put them in a prison they will never reoffend. That's unrealistic. As a society have to decide what the purpose of imprisonment is - what do we want it to do?\"</p> <p>What Narey wants it to do is educate. \"Of a total prison population of 60,000, around 40,000 are unemployable. What I want to do is give them basic education and constructive employment,\" he says in soft Teesside tones. \"If they haven't got a job, of course they'll reoffend. They have no choice.\"</p> <p>We are here to look at Feltham's new \u00a36m education and reception unit for juvenile offenders, the 15- to 18-year-olds who are Narey's priority. Opened in August, it is a pristine pale-blue building with classrooms that any inner-city headmaster would give his chalk and board for. The smell of paint still lingers, not yet chased away by the ubiquitous prison odour of chips, rolling tobacco and sweat. The backing track of prison life - shouts and footfalls, jangling keys and slamming steel doors - is left outside. Narey grasps the hand of every officer and volunteer we pass and gives them the opportunity to bend his ear.</p> <p>Inside the classrooms, groups of a dozen are studying information technology and basic literacy and numeracy. Most of the kids here got nothing out of school except bitter experience. Now the teachers at Feltham are trying to capitalise on the one advantage they have: a captive audience. The work is a grind and the potential for disruption massive, yet by tiny degrees the teacher maintains order and attention. One lad with a reputation for trouble is multiplying at the blackboard. He takes the arrival of the director general and friends as an opportunity to switch off. He tries to grab a handful of forms, then tries to sit when the teacher wants him to stand. She is having none of it and eventually he finishes his sums.</p> <p>\"What you just saw there was a little triumph,\" says Narey when we leave. \"That lady got the lad to pay attention using nothing more than communication skills. Hundreds of potential incidents every day can be defused like that.\"</p> <p>But this new education unit is far from the whole story at Feltham. On the other side of the fence that separates the juveniles from the 18- to 21-year-olds, the huge demands placed on Feltham are clear. In units housing up to 60 lads, half can be banged up all day, unlocked only to collect their meals.</p> <p>Swallow unit is where Mubarek was killed. The cells run on two decks along two walls, and facing them are the servery and the officers' control room. In between is the association area, with a pool table, its baize almost worn through. The lads emerge for lunch. \"We have to unlock slow because we've some characters in at the moment,\" says an officer. \"They don't all get on as we might like.\" Those who are first in the queue collect a plate of thin chips; pale peas; a choice of pie, fish or corned beef; a bread roll and an apple. How's the food? \"Shit,\" an inmate replies.</p> <p>The cells have brightly painted red, blue and yellow doors. Inside they are a dreary cream, although an inmate painting team is busy brightening them up. The sheets are brown. One lad says his window leaks and points to some brown stains. \"That's spit - people used it to stick posters to the walls. I can't get it off.\" Prisoners have to be inventive to stick up their lad-mag pin-ups. Toothpaste is a current favourite, although Narey encountered a man at Parkhurst who used semen. \"Very effective,\" he says, with a grimace.</p> <p>In cell 38, where Mubarek was killed, the two beds are 3ft apart. The toilet is in a doorless alcove. The only ventilation is the barred window, of which one pane opens. The lads in there now have a chess board set up on a table like the one Stewart snapped the leg from to kill Mubarek. They seem to get on.</p> <p>So did Stewart and Zahid, according to the wing officers, most of whom were traumatised by the death. \"When something like that happens the first thing you do is ask yourself, 'What more could I have done? Where there signs?' We saw his tattoo and you have hunches, but they honestly seemed to get on OK. They were together six weeks before he done it,\" says one officer. \"The guilt is crippling... and then you know someone will be along looking for a scapegoat.\" Narey, listening hard, nods in agreement, but while the director general chats to some lads, the officer opens up. \"We haven't the staff to get to know these lads properly. They're locked up 22-and-a-half hours a day then we unlock the doors. It can be like throwing a match into a box of fireworks.\"</p> <p>A senior officer at Feltham, with 12 years' experience, explains the hidden cost of staff shortages and sickness, which runs at 18.5 days a year per officer: the lack of personal knowledge of the prisoners. \"I remember once a colleague said to me one Saturday, 'Have you noticed Williams? Every weekend he's all tidy, his shoes are polished up and he's in his best gear. What's that all about?' It turned out every weekend he was waiting for a visit from his parents that never came. They used to visit but then they stopped. I looked into it and it turned out his parents had moved but the visiting orders were still being sent to the old address. We got them sent to the new address and they started visiting again. Things like that used to make the job worthwhile. The way we're going now we don't even have the time to realise we have got a fucking neo-Nazi thug in the same cell as an Asian lad.\"</p> <p>Narey acknowledges the problems and says he will address them. He knows officers are angry, but says he will sack those who \"swing the lead\". He gives the impression that every suicide in a British jail cuts deep. There were 94 last year and reducing that number is his top priority. He also wants a public debate about the role of prisons. \"A lot of people don't give a damn about what goes on inside prison walls, and only get engaged when they think we're running holiday camps. Well, I'd rather be criticised for giving them all a TV, for treating them well, than for being too harsh.\"</p> <p>Both Pascoe and Narey say they would like young offenders' institutions to be places where their own teenage sons would be treated fairly, should they get into trouble. One day Huntercombe young offenders' institution, high in the Chilterns near Reading, will be the sort of place they have in mind. At this juvenile-only establishment, governor Paul Manwaring has established a \"term\" system. Prisoners study employment skills - painting and decorating, bricklaying, car mechanics - for 10 weeks, then have a \"break week\" in which they take art, drama or music classes, culminating in a prize day and performances.</p> <p>Huntercombe is far from utopian, but in a resettlement class on the Mountbatten wing the fruits of the regime are apparent. Here, 10 kids within three months of release are taking a class aimed at preparing them for life on the outside. In contrast to many of the lads in the classrooms and on the wings both here and at Feltham, they are communicative and confident; they can see light at the end of the tunnel. Statistics say eight of them will be back, but for the moment they are looking forward, mainly to a McDonald's and to seeing their friends. The class volunteer and prison officer leave the room and I ask them if there is anything they want to say about prison. \"Can we really say anything and you'll put it in the paper?\" asks Frank. I nod. He grins and says: \"Tell all our parents, 'Hello from Huntercombe!' \"</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the wall of the governor's office at Feltham young offenders' institution there are three picture hooks. Normally the governors' roll hangs here - an oak board bearing the names of those who have occupied perhaps the hottest seat in the prison service. On a chill morning earlier this week the hooks were vacant. \"It's down in the workshop having my name added. The paint's not dry yet,\" says Nick Pascoe, the new boss of Britain's most notorious youth prison. From the window, through a thick mist, we can make out the top of the steel-mesh fence crowned with rolled razor wire that marks the boundaries of his estate; 96 acres housing up to 700 of the most disturbed, deprived and dangerous young men in the country. The office may as well have a revolving door. Pascoe, who started three weeks ago, is the fifth man to take the job in the past 18 months. He was tempted back from his job at a private jail by Martin Narey, the director general of the prison service, whose arrival we await. \"I shall tell him I returned the company car this morning,\" Pascoe says with a wry grin. \"That's the ultimate sacrifice, isn't it?\" Having to run his own car will be the least of Pascoe's worries. Within days of the new governor taking up his post a former Feltham prisoner, Robert Stewart, was convicted of murdering his 19-year-old Asian cellmate, Zahid Mubarek. Stewart, a 20-year-old racist psychopath with a cross and the letters RIP tattooed on his forehead, beat Zahid to death with a table leg in their 7ft by 10ft cell in the middle of the night in March. An internal inquiry found that ample evidence of Stewart's racist, violent tendencies and declining mental health had been missed or ignored by prison staff. Stewart's conviction was the latest event in a miserable year for the jail. On a Saturday morning at the end of October, tensions spilled over and officers lost control of a unit housing 60 prisoners. In the four hours it took to regain control, the wing was trashed. In September, Kevin Henson, 16, ended his short, tragic life with a noose hung from an exposed pipe in his cell. Pascoe's task is to turn Feltham around. It will not be easy. Serving every court in London and most of those in the south-east, Feltham is the largest young offenders' institution in the country; it sees 30,000 boys and young men between the age of 15 and 21 pass through its gates every year. Some stay briefly on remand; others are at the start of a long prison career. Feltham is short-staffed, 23-hour-a-day bang-ups are common, morale is low and the institution's reputation stinks. One experienced youth worker dismisses it as \"a finishing school for career criminals\". Pascoe thinks of the place in less absolute terms. \"Some of these men are dangerous and sophisticated criminals; others are totally unsophisticated and very damaged. The public expectation is that if you put them in a prison they will never reoffend. That's unrealistic. As a society have to decide what the purpose of imprisonment is - what do we want it to do?\" What Narey wants it to do is educate. \"Of a total prison population of 60,000, around 40,000 are unemployable. What I want to do is give them basic education and constructive employment,\" he says in soft Teesside tones. \"If they haven't got a job, of course they'll reoffend. They have no choice.\" We are here to look at Feltham's new \u00a36m education and reception unit for juvenile offenders, the 15- to 18-year-olds who are Narey's priority. Opened in August, it is a pristine pale-blue building with classrooms that any inner-city headmaster would give his chalk and board for. The smell of paint still lingers, not yet chased away by the ubiquitous prison odour of chips, rolling tobacco and sweat. The backing track of prison life - shouts and footfalls, jangling keys and slamming steel doors - is left outside. Narey grasps the hand of every officer and volunteer we pass and gives them the opportunity to bend his ear. Inside the classrooms, groups of a dozen are studying information technology and basic literacy and numeracy. Most of the kids here got nothing out of school except bitter experience. Now the teachers at Feltham are trying to capitalise on the one advantage they have: a captive audience. The work is a grind and the potential for disruption massive, yet by tiny degrees the teacher maintains order and attention. One lad with a reputation for trouble is multiplying at the blackboard. He takes the arrival of the director general and friends as an opportunity to switch off. He tries to grab a handful of forms, then tries to sit when the teacher wants him to stand. She is having none of it and eventually he finishes his sums. \"What you just saw there was a little triumph,\" says Narey when we leave. \"That lady got the lad to pay attention using nothing more than communication skills. Hundreds of potential incidents every day can be defused like that.\" But this new education unit is far from the whole story at Feltham. On the other side of the fence that separates the juveniles from the 18- to 21-year-olds, the huge demands placed on Feltham are clear. In units housing up to 60 lads, half can be banged up all day, unlocked only to collect their meals. Swallow unit is where Mubarek was killed. The cells run on two decks along two walls, and facing them are the servery and the officers' control room. In between is the association area, with a pool table, its baize almost worn through. The lads emerge for lunch. \"We have to unlock slow because we've some characters in at the moment,\" says an officer. \"They don't all get on as we might like.\" Those who are first in the queue collect a plate of thin chips; pale peas; a choice of pie, fish or corned beef; a bread roll and an apple. How's the food? \"Shit,\" an inmate replies. The cells have brightly painted red, blue and yellow doors. Inside they are a dreary cream, although an inmate painting team is busy brightening them up. The sheets are brown. One lad says his window leaks and points to some brown stains. \"That's spit - people used it to stick posters to the walls. I can't get it off.\" Prisoners have to be inventive to stick up their lad-mag pin-ups. Toothpaste is a current favourite, although Narey encountered a man at Parkhurst who used semen. \"Very effective,\" he says, with a grimace. In cell 38, where Mubarek was killed, the two beds are 3ft apart. The toilet is in a doorless alcove. The only ventilation is the barred window, of which one pane opens. The lads in there now have a chess board set up on a table like the one Stewart snapped the leg from to kill Mubarek. They seem to get on. So did Stewart and Zahid, according to the wing officers, most of whom were traumatised by the death. \"When something like that happens the first thing you do is ask yourself, 'What more could I have done? Where there signs?' We saw his tattoo and you have hunches, but they honestly seemed to get on OK. They were together six weeks before he done it,\" says one officer. \"The guilt is crippling... and then you know someone will be along looking for a scapegoat.\" Narey, listening hard, nods in agreement, but while the director general chats to some lads, the officer opens up. \"We haven't the staff to get to know these lads properly. They're locked up 22-and-a-half hours a day then we unlock the doors. It can be like throwing a match into a box of fireworks.\" A senior officer at Feltham, with 12 years' experience, explains the hidden cost of staff shortages and sickness, which runs at 18.5 days a year per officer: the lack of personal knowledge of the prisoners. \"I remember once a colleague said to me one Saturday, 'Have you noticed Williams? Every weekend he's all tidy, his shoes are polished up and he's in his best gear. What's that all about?' It turned out every weekend he was waiting for a visit from his parents that never came. They used to visit but then they stopped. I looked into it and it turned out his parents had moved but the visiting orders were still being sent to the old address. We got them sent to the new address and they started visiting again. Things like that used to make the job worthwhile. The way we're going now we don't even have the time to realise we have got a fucking neo-Nazi thug in the same cell as an Asian lad.\" Narey acknowledges the problems and says he will address them. He knows officers are angry, but says he will sack those who \"swing the lead\". He gives the impression that every suicide in a British jail cuts deep. There were 94 last year and reducing that number is his top priority. He also wants a public debate about the role of prisons. \"A lot of people don't give a damn about what goes on inside prison walls, and only get engaged when they think we're running holiday camps. Well, I'd rather be criticised for giving them all a TV, for treating them well, than for being too harsh.\" Both Pascoe and Narey say they would like young offenders' institutions to be places where their own teenage sons would be treated fairly, should they get into trouble. One day Huntercombe young offenders' institution, high in the Chilterns near Reading, will be the sort of place they have in mind. At this juvenile-only establishment, governor Paul Manwaring has established a \"term\" system. Prisoners study employment skills - painting and decorating, bricklaying, car mechanics - for 10 weeks, then have a \"break week\" in which they take art, drama or music classes, culminating in a prize day and performances. Huntercombe is far from utopian, but in a resettlement class on the Mountbatten wing the fruits of the regime are apparent. Here, 10 kids within three months of release are taking a class aimed at preparing them for life on the outside. In contrast to many of the lads in the classrooms and on the wings both here and at Feltham, they are communicative and confident; they can see light at the end of the tunnel. Statistics say eight of them will be back, but for the moment they are looking forward, mainly to a McDonald's and to seeing their friends. The class volunteer and prison officer leave the room and I ask them if there is anything they want to say about prison. \"Can we really say anything and you'll put it in the paper?\" asks Frank. I nod. He grins and says: \"Tell all our parents, 'Hello from Huntercombe!' \"",

By an overwhelming majority the MEPs backed new freedom of information proposals that would grant the right of access to most official documents from any institution in Brussels. Meeting in Strasbourg, the parliament voted by 409 to three for a plan tabled by a British Labour MEP Michael Cashman. Negotiations must now begin with the European Commission - the supranational executive of the EU - and the European Council, where the governments of the 15 member states cooperate. If the parliament gets its way, official papers on issues such as BSE, radiation from mobile phones, and genetically modified organisms would be routinely available. So would information about border controls, the police network Europol and all but the most sensitive papers on EU defence and foreign policy. \"This vote sends the signal that we are going to deliver something that gives far greater access,\" Mr Cashman said. \"This exercise is about restoring confidence and establishing accountability in the European project. Public confidence in official decision making is very low.\" But there was criticism that the proposals did not go far enough and could still be watered down. \"Parliament will have to continue to fight all the way to get any serious degree of openness from the council and commission,\" warned Graham Watson of the Liberal Democrat group. The proposals call for a public register of documents, a minimal list of exemptions, and access to papers held by, and not just originating in, the EU's three big institutions. They are being tabled to meet the requirement of the 1997 treaty of Amsterdam for the creation of a code of access to documents by May 2001 - a response to years of concern about a lack of transparency in the EU. Criticism has focused on cumbersome procedures for classification and rules that allow officials \"space to think\" - to formulate policy before it is exposed to public scrutiny. Tony Bunyan of Statewatch, a London-based civil liberties group, said last night: \"The Cashman report has got the balance wrong between rights for citizens and rights for institutions.\" Freedom of information is a sensitive issue in Brussels. The previous European Commission, under Jacques Santer of Luxembourg, was discredited and eventually forced to resign partly over issues of lack of transparency. Romano Prodi, his Italian successor, has published a list of his correspondence on his website, though not the documents themselves, and has been sharply criticised by the EU ombudsman. Britain insists it is taking an open approach to the new code, with diplomats privately blaming France, currently holding the EU's rotating presidency, for resisting. Italy and Germany are also reluctant. Opponents of greater openness warn that Nato will be less willing to share its secrets with fledgling EU defence bodies if freedom of information procedures are too relaxed. Britain says it is ready to scrap last summer's controversial decision to permanently exclude from public access whole categories of documents covering EU foreign policy, military and \"non-military crisis management\" - and any other document, classified or not, which refers to these issues. The decision was pushed through by Javier Solana, the European Council's foreign policy supremo, and currently faces legal challenges from the Netherlands government and the European Parliament. Parliament says EU institutions may refuse access to documents only where disclosure could significantly undermine the protection of public security in the union and member states; defence and military matters; and relations with third countries.",

The warmer, more popular version, feted for centuries as the original, was probably painted by Bartolomeo Manfredi, a contemporary of the Italian master, the Rome daily Il Messaggero reported. Generations of scholars were convinced that the canvas, which hung in a Capuchin church on Via Veneto in Rome, was the real Caravaggio. Many had considered it superior to a slightly more sombre version in St Peter's church in Carpineto Romano, a town near Rome. The virtually identical works went on display together for the first time yesterday in Rome's Palazzo Barberini. It was after using radiography techniques that two restorers - Rossella Vodret and Carlo Giantomassi - said they believed the gloomier painting was the Caravaggio. The mixture of reds, yellows and grains of malachite - a Caravaggio trademark - was present only in the St Peter's painting, they said. Maurizio Marini, an expert on the artist, was reported as saying that while both works exuded sensory realism, the subtle differences in light and shade, plus the powder used, suggested that the St Peter's version could have been painted only by Caravaggio, probably around 1609, a year before he died at the age of 37. Ms Vodret and Mr Giantomassi, said they had intended only to save the painting from decay, not uncover a mystery. A scholar, Maria Vittoria Brugnoli, declared it the original after discovering it in St Peter's in 1968. It is thought to have been donated in the late 19th century by one of Carpineto Romano's most famous sons, Pope Leo XIII. However, colleagues rebuffed Ms Brugnoli's claim and clung to the view, believed for centuries, that the original was the one hung in Via Veneto. Uncertainty produced by the abundance of Caravaggio copies would continue to torment scholars and produce more surprises, Il Messaggero predicted. \"The copy is of good quality, certainly its charm is even more attractive than the severity of the original,\" the newspaper said.

      "bodyText": "Legal &amp; General is to have more female directors on its board than any other FTSE 100 company after a shake-up yesterday that included the re-appointment of the chief executive beyond his retirement age. David Prosser, the chief executive who last year tried to broaden his role by selling the group to NatWest, is to extend his position to 2006, two years beyond his 60th birthday. Finance director Tony Hobson will leave in February after 13 years and be replaced by Andrew Palmer, director of corporate business. L&amp;G also promoted Kate Avery, retail customer director, to the board. Along with Beverley Hodson, managing director of WH Smith UK retail, who was yesterday named as a new non-executive, Ms Avery will be one of four females in the boardroom. This would appear to put L&amp;G above top ranking Pearson in the recently compiled FTSE Female index, which measured the number of woman in Britain's boardrooms, although the publishing group is actually run by Marjorie Scardino. L&amp;G said Mr Prosser had been asked to stay on to tackle the introduction of low-cost stakeholder pensions next year which threatens to erode the profitability of insurance companies. Chairman Rob Margetts described the departure of Mr Hobson, the finance director, as the \"end of an era\". Robin Phipps, director of retail business, takes on the roles held by Andrew Palmer, Mr Hobson's replacement.",

      "body": "<p>There is a countervailing international agreement to the World Trade Organisation's on patenting and intellectual property rights (The price of life, November 15). The convention on biological diversity is legally binding on 179 governments. Forty of these are now in Neuchatel, trying to agree the text of a subsidiary instrument, the international undertaking on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (IU).</p> <p>This IU has the potential to exempt an entire category of the earth's \"commons\" - the plant life forms used to provide food security - from privatisation and corporate control. It could restrict the \"biopiracy\" of which John Vidal wrote eloquently in your Patenting Life supplement (November 15) and continue to allow the free exchange, sale and communal ownership of life-sustaining genetic materials. The IU could also ensure that more than half a million samples of crop, forage and agroforestry species taken from farmers and held in trust in gene banks will be safeguarded in the public domain.</p> <p>Yet the negotiations this week have become highly strained, with some countries refusing to accept those articles which would, in their view \"conflict with\" (ie limit) the dominance of intellectual property rights rules under the WTO. ITDG, its partners from developing countries and smallholder farmers have lobbied strongly for the IU negotiations to be completed swiftly. Developing nations, including the Africa Group, desperately want it. They know that 90% of the seeds which create food security for their people are currently exchanged between farmers, not traded by seed companies. But countries whose corporate industries benefit from WTO rules are holding the process back. It is urgent that the UK drives the EU into a positive, united position, which could be crucial to securing agreement. <br><b>Patrick Mulvany</b> <br>Intermediate Technology Development Group <br><a href=\"mailto:itdg@itdg.org.uk\">itdg@itdg.org.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Intellectual property rights, especially patents, enable global knowledge cartels to coordinate and solve an enforcement problem. Any cartel member faces the problem that another may cheat and try to take more of the market than agreed. Emerging multinationals in the early part of the 20th century turned to intellectual property rights and complex licensing arrangements based on those rights to co-ordinate and enforce global cartels. Patent licences enabled them to group together to fix prices, limit production, divide markets and exclude competitors.</p> <p>The problem of cartel formation by companies previously involved in chemicals or pharmaceuticals and now expanding into biotechnology continues. Witness the anti-trust litigation by US and international farmers against Monsanto, Dow, Du Pont, and Novartis for forming a cartel in the GM corn and soy-bean markets. Unfortunately, the alleged benefits of the biotech revolution will be delivered to consumers at great cost. Intellectual property rules in many ways represent the ultimate conspiracy against the public. <br><b>Dr Peter Drahos </b> <br> Intellectual property research institute, Queen Mary College <br> <a href=\"mailto:P.F.Drahos@qmw.ac.uk\">P.F.Drahos@qmw.ac.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Tim Radford (Patenting Life) poses the question whether two separate groups could patent the same piece of genetic information for two different functions.

      "bodyText": "There is a countervailing international agreement to the World Trade Organisation's on patenting and intellectual property rights (The price of life, November 15). The convention on biological diversity is legally binding on 179 governments. Forty of these are now in Neuchatel, trying to agree the text of a subsidiary instrument, the international undertaking on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (IU). This IU has the potential to exempt an entire category of the earth's \"commons\" - the plant life forms used to provide food security - from privatisation and corporate control. It could restrict the \"biopiracy\" of which John Vidal wrote eloquently in your Patenting Life supplement (November 15) and continue to allow the free exchange, sale and communal ownership of life-sustaining genetic materials. The IU could also ensure that more than half a million samples of crop, forage and agroforestry species taken from farmers and held in trust in gene banks will be safeguarded in the public domain. Yet the negotiations this week have become highly strained, with some countries refusing to accept those articles which would, in their view \"conflict with\" (ie limit) the dominance of intellectual property rights rules under the WTO. ITDG, its partners from developing countries and smallholder farmers have lobbied strongly for the IU negotiations to be completed swiftly. Developing nations, including the Africa Group, desperately want it. They know that 90% of the seeds which create food security for their people are currently exchanged between farmers, not traded by seed companies. But countries whose corporate industries benefit from WTO rules are holding the process back. It is urgent that the UK drives the EU into a positive, united position, which could be crucial to securing agreement. Patrick Mulvany Intermediate Technology Development Group itdg@itdg.org.uk \u0095 Intellectual property rights, especially patents, enable global knowledge cartels to coordinate and solve an enforcement problem. Any cartel member faces the problem that another may cheat and try to take more of the market than agreed. Emerging multinationals in the early part of the 20th century turned to intellectual property rights and complex licensing arrangements based on those rights to co-ordinate and enforce global cartels. Patent licences enabled them to group together to fix prices, limit production, divide markets and exclude competitors. The problem of cartel formation by companies previously involved in chemicals or pharmaceuticals and now expanding into biotechnology continues. Witness the anti-trust litigation by US and international farmers against Monsanto, Dow, Du Pont, and Novartis for forming a cartel in the GM corn and soy-bean markets. Unfortunately, the alleged benefits of the biotech revolution will be delivered to consumers at great cost. Intellectual property rules in many ways represent the ultimate conspiracy against the public. Dr Peter Drahos Intellectual property research institute, Queen Mary College P.F.Drahos@qmw.ac.uk \u0095 Tim Radford (Patenting Life) poses the question whether two separate groups could patent the same piece of genetic information for two different functions. He rightly points out that if so, there could be no question of anyone \"owning\" a gene. This issue was addressed over five years ago in an acclaimed report by the Commons' science and technology committee. We recommended that only a combination of a gene and a known utility which is novel should be patentable, and that a combination of the same gene and a further novel utility should also be patentable. Regrettably neither the present nor the previous governments have acted on that recommendation. Lynne Jones MP \u0095 The UK patent application you chose to illustrate how scientists \"patent life\" describes Michael Antoniou as one of the inventors - the same individual who you invited to warn us of the dangers of genetic interference in the agricultural industry during your online GM food debate, some months back. Do some experts believe the genetics revolution is bad for plants but OK for us humans?

      "bodyText": "The Germany chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, suffered a setback yesterday when his transport minister resigned, three days after a court found him guilty of aiding embezzlement in a corruption scandal involving the illicit funding of a football club. The decision by Reinhard Klimmt, a member of the governing Social Democratic party (SPD), to step down from his cabinet post came less than 24 hours after Mr Schr\u00f6der had faced down a political storm by backing the minister's declared intention to stay in office and appeal against the conviction in a higher court. But a media outcry, coupled with protests from his Green coalition partners and from within his own party, evidently forced him to backtrack. In a statement yesterday, Mr Schr\u00f6der said: \"I have great respect for Reinhard Klimmt's decision to resign.\" The government named Kurt Bodewig, a transport ministry state secretary, as his successor. Klimmt was brought into the Schr\u00f6der government last year, in a move designed to placate leftwing Social Democrats concerned about the government's faltering relationship with Germany's powerful trade unions and its commitment to social justice. On Monday, a court in the state of Saarland found Klimmt guilty of aiding and abetting embezzlement and fined him DM27,000 (\u00a38,300) . At the heart of the case is a charity, Caritas Tragergesellschaft Trier (CTT), which racked up losses of more than \u00a36m under a former director. During an investigation into the charity's affairs, investigators discovered that CTT had been subsidising a local football club, FC Saarbr\u00fccken. Under a contract signed in 1997, when Klimmt was club chairman, CTT breached its charitable status by handing over nearly \u00a3200,000. Claims have been made that the charity won favours from the regional administration in return and, in particular, that hospitals run by CTT were protected from budget cuts. Prosecutors said they could find no evidence that Klimmt, a former head of the regional administration, had misused his influence, and there is no suggestion that he benefited personally from the fraud. Klimmt at first accepted the court ruling. But on Tuesday he insisted the conviction was based on incomplete evidence and said he would appeal. The affair has damaged the Social Democrats. Until yesterday they seemed to have captured the moral high ground from the opposition Christian Democrats who are still suffering from the fallout of a funding scandal involving their leading lights, including former chancellor Helmut Kohl. \"The chancellor has got a real problem,\" said the Christian Democrat general secretary designate, Laurenz Meyer. \"He has finally been forced to bow to public pressure, but it's obvious that he knew about this scandal months ago. He could have acted much earlier,\" he added. The Klimmt affair has also highlighted a growing rift between the Social Democrats and their Green coalition partners who were among the first to demand the transport minister's immediate resignation. During a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Mr Schr\u00f6der was reported to have accused the Greens of using the affair to \"promote themselves at the expense of the SPD\". The Greens have recently relaunched themselves as critics of the ruling party, taking Mr Schr\u00f6der to task over health, immigration and transport reform. Their criticism was borne out on Wednesday, when independent advisers briefed to report on Germany's economic prospects argued that despite the government's success in disciplining the budget, the rest of its reform programme would fail to make \"the desired lasting impression\" on the economy \"if carried out in its present form\".",

The vehicle rolled at least once as its roof was ripped off and passengers were flung up to 20 metres away. Twenty seven people were killed instantly and nine others were injured.

They said the marks suggested the brakes had been applied and that the coach was travelling at high speed in an area where the limit was 60 km per hour. An investigation showed that the light was related to an air conditioning problem and there was no discernible fault with the brakes. Police said the four year-old British-made luxury bus was well maintained and had been fully serviced four days before the accident.

The win is an enormous one for Carat as Vodafone spends some \u00a341m on advertising in the UK alone. The move will come as a considerable blow to OMD UK, Vodafone's UK media agency, which was understood to have pitched for the business alongside Universal McCann and Mindshare. Existing local agencies will continue to buy the campaigns by country while Carat International will handle the European media planning and the buying of international media. The selection follows the appointment last month of McCann Erickson as Vodafone's first global advertising agency. McCann and Carat will now work together as Vodafone makes its transition to a single global brand. Thomas Geitner, Vodafone Group's executive board director responsible for global branding, said: \"The appointment of our first European media planning agency is part of our strategy to establish a strong global brand and position ourselves as the world's leading mobile multimedia company. \"We chose Carat International because of its imaginative media selection and its plans for a branding campaign as well as its robust network and strong team.\" Vodafone purchased the \u00a3105bn German telecoms company Mannesman last year.

His biggest hit was Side Saddle (1959). He emerged during a hiatus in popular music, before exportable British rock took hold, that produced a clutch of successful piano players, including Winifred Atwell and Liberace, who, along with Conway, were to influence the work of Elton John in later decades. </p> <p>Conway was a particular favourite. Tall, anonymously handsome and with shining white teeth - this at a time when complicated bridgework was largely a stranger to British dentistry - he had a particular appeal to women. He sold more than 30m records, had 17 consecutive top-20 hits, his own television shows, mansions, Bentleys and Rolls-Royces. He was always embarrassed at being compared to Liberace, the white-fur-coated and smirking American pianist. </p> <p>In fact, Conway's and Liberace's music and lifestyles were quite different. It was not just Conway's looks that set him apart from the flamboyant American; his piano style was leaner, firmer and less pretentious, less nakedly appealing to blue-rinsed ladies. His glissandi were no less confident, but less self-indulgent, and he was equally as sure when handling A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square as Tiger Rag. </p> <p>His lifestyle, too, though at one time luxurious by the cramped style of the times, was less pretentious, not reliant on screaming clothes; Conway favoured plain dark suits and ties, more in line with his humble background. Nor was he a natural in meeting the extravagant demands of showmanship, which, as a shy man, he always found stressful. </p> <p>Throughout his life, he was prone to illnesses and accidents, which he saw as his body's reaction against the tyranny of the piano. He fell, broke a hip and was paralysed for several days; he had strokes; he sliced off the top of a finger with a bread-slicer - something which, ironically, became a Conway signature as television cameras zoomed into his hands on the keyboard - and he smoked up to 80 untipped cigarettes a day. </p> <p>Close on 70 years of age, he jammed a finger in the door of his Rolls-Royce, but he never agreed with the pundits who pensioned him off. A few months later in Bristol, he was busy entertaining a belated 50th anniversary tea-dance to celebrate Victory in Europe Day, where he nonchalantly peeled off the bandage from his wounded finger before attacking the keys. </p> <p>Born in Bristol as Trevor Stanford, the name he retained for his composing work, Conway was the son of a mother who died when he was 14, but who had been an amateur pianist and contralto in her day. Unlike his two brothers, who had musical education but no talent, Conway had virtually no musical education, apart from a single boyhood lesson. His clerical-worker father put his son through secretarial college after the boy left school at 14, and then got him a job as a solicitor's clerk. But, at 16, Conway made for the Merchant Navy training school and his first passage, on a Dutch freighter. </p> <p>During the second world war, he earned the distinguished service medal in the Royal Navy for \"gallantry and devotion to duty\" in mine-sweeping in the Mediterranean. After four years in the RN, his long-running stomach ulcer saw him invalided out. The end of the war found him see-sawing between the Merchant Navy and dead-end jobs as a salesman, plumber's mate and barman. </p> <p>Then a friend suggested he stand in for a holidaying club pianist. He played in pubs and clubs, and was seen by the choreographer Irving Davies, who was so impressed that he asked him to play piano for stars at rehearsals. He worked for Dennis Lotis, Dorothy Squires and Gracie Fields. But it was when Conway made it to the Billy Cotton Band Show, a fixture on BBC radio and television in the 1950s and early 1960s, that the rumbustious bandleader persuaded him to loosen up his playing, and helped create the disciplined freedom of the mature Conway style. </p> <p>It was not playing but composing that indirectly led him to fame. A musical he had written for the comedian Frankie Howerd, Mr Venus, was a write-off, but it led him to writing the score for a TV musical, Beauty And The Beast. For it, he had to write a last-minute tune for one brief scene set in a ballroom. Sitting in the rehearsal room, Conway wrote 16 bars as an olde-world gavotte and scribbled \"Side Saddle\" beside it in the margin. </p> <p>Though it was to become virtually his signature tune, the music industry was, at first, blind to the piece's potential. A publisher took all Conway's music for Beauty And The Beast - except Side Saddle, which he dismissed as \"too old-fashioned\". Another publisher, after its writer had honky-tonked it up, did not agree. Soon, Conway was a national figure, and China Tea, Roulette and Snowcoach followed. </p> <p>In 1960, when he had his first television show, Russ Conway And A Few Friends, he was reputed to be earning \u00a3500 a week, then a huge sum, in record and sheet sales alone. He became an instantly recognisable face and sound, while the media found him politely evasive when discussing anything except his work. He moved from a basement flat in Maida Vale, where he personally answered his fan mail, to a mansion, where three full-timers did the job. </p> <p>The music promoter who had called him \"an atrocious pianist\" was in a minority, but symbolised the stress Conway felt he was under. The stomach ulcer returned. In 1963, he had a nervous breakdown while playing at Scarborough, and then fell and fractured a hip, leaving him paralysed for three days; two years later, at only 38, he had the first of his strokes. </p> <p>He had several times to give up playing, but never had to give up composing. He and his compositions were heard at seaside resorts and at theatres, including the London Palladium, long after his records had vanished from the charts. </p> <p>At 65, Conway discovered he had cancer. Noting that others waiting to see specialists were either talkative and confident of surviving or silent and morose, he resolved to be part of the former group - and succeeded for many years. He lived on in Eastbourne and never married. </p> <p>\u0095 Russ Conway (Trevor Stanford), pianist and composer, born September 2 1925; died November 15 2000</p>",

      "body": "<p>As Tony Blair braces himself for next month's European summit in Nice ministers are showing signs of jitters. It is hardly surprising that they are. </p> <p>Public hostility to things European, above all the euro, deepens rather than subsides. William Hague and his zealous team can issue 26 pages of Euro-attack on ministerial speeches before those speeches are even delivered, as they did on Monday. They think it is their best election card. </p> <p>Mr Blair made a speech on global inter-dependence at the Mansion House in the City (that is what his spin doctors said it was about in advance). But Mr Cook also made a speech attacking \"Euro-myths\" on straight bananas and cucumbers as well as negative press reporting. The media duly dubbed it a new campaign on Europe, though both stressed nothing had changed. </p> <p>Ministers repeatedly try to sell a positive message on Europe. Mr Blair calls them in privately to instruct them to do so. The message gets drowned out by what is often near-hysterical xenophobia. So do genuine questions about the future of the EU which ministers ought to answer. Barely a day passes without what Harold Macmillan famously called \"events, dear boy, events\" conspiring to ambush the government. They come from all directions, including well intentioned, pro-European ministers like Robin Cook and Peter Mandelson </p> <p>This week should have been a quiet one on the euro-front, at least in public. As usual in the run-up to such a meeting Mr Blair had a video conference with President Jacques Chirac of France, another yesterday with his socialist premier, Lionel Jospin. He later dined at No 10 with Chancellor Schroder of Germany on a flying visit. </p> <p>But he also faced a flurry of media headlines generated by speeches made by Mr Cook and after-dinner remarks by Mr Mandelson. Yesterday there was a report by a Labour-dominated select committee about the cost (much exaggerated) of preparing to join the euro, the day before a gratuitous suggestion by Germany's foreign minister, Joska Fischer, that the time is coming when EU voters will elect Romano Prodi's successor as president of the European commission. </p> <p>The malevolence and ignorance of parts of the media on this subject cannot be exaggerated. But the awkward fact is that Martin O'Neill's select committee did indeed suggest that euro conversion might cost \u00a335bn. Mr Fischer did shoot his mouth off. </p> <p>The brutal fact is that the agenda for Nice is about little or none of the above. It chiefly concerns that so-called \"Amsterdam left-overs,\" the issues unresolved when EU leaders met in June 1997 - and Tony Blair won the bicycle race at his first summit. </p> <p>They are about how to make the EU work more efficiently and take decisions more quickly in readiness for the day - long postponed - when the first of 15 applicant countries, led by Poland and the Czech republic, start to turn the EU 15 into 20 or even 30 members. </p> <p>That means altering three things: </p> <p>\u0095 the number of commissioners, so that not every state automatically has one except those which currently have two, including Britain; </p> <p>\u0095 the way the council of ministers, the dominant force in the EU at present, counts its votes. Luxembourg with 400,000 people currently has two votes in council, Germany with 80m has 10; </p> <p>\u0095 trickiest of all, there is the need to reduce the number of topics on which the national veto is exercised, to expedite decision making because 30 vetos would be a nightmare. </p> <p>It is dangerous for Mr Blair precisely because it allows the Sun or Daily Mail to say Britain is poised to \"give up the veto on 40 issues\", as the Mail did yesterday. </p> <p>It did not help that the French EU presidency's working text for Nice, which surfaced in Whitehall yesterday, persists in wanting to curb the national veto on sensitive tax matters like VAT, excise duties and the anti-fraud \"withholding tax\". </p> <p>Labour has made clear it wants more majority voting (ie no veto) on many issues, such as the environment. But it will not yield on the five big issues of tax, social security, treaty changes, defence and border controls. </p> <p>There is no reason to think that it will. </p>",

      "bodyText": "As Tony Blair braces himself for next month's European summit in Nice ministers are showing signs of jitters. It is hardly surprising that they are. Public hostility to things European, above all the euro, deepens rather than subsides. William Hague and his zealous team can issue 26 pages of Euro-attack on ministerial speeches before those speeches are even delivered, as they did on Monday. They think it is their best election card. Mr Blair made a speech on global inter-dependence at the Mansion House in the City (that is what his spin doctors said it was about in advance). But Mr Cook also made a speech attacking \"Euro-myths\" on straight bananas and cucumbers as well as negative press reporting. The media duly dubbed it a new campaign on Europe, though both stressed nothing had changed. Ministers repeatedly try to sell a positive message on Europe. Mr Blair calls them in privately to instruct them to do so. The message gets drowned out by what is often near-hysterical xenophobia. So do genuine questions about the future of the EU which ministers ought to answer. Barely a day passes without what Harold Macmillan famously called \"events, dear boy, events\" conspiring to ambush the government. They come from all directions, including well intentioned, pro-European ministers like Robin Cook and Peter Mandelson This week should have been a quiet one on the euro-front, at least in public. As usual in the run-up to such a meeting Mr Blair had a video conference with President Jacques Chirac of France, another yesterday with his socialist premier, Lionel Jospin. He later dined at No 10 with Chancellor Schroder of Germany on a flying visit. But he also faced a flurry of media headlines generated by speeches made by Mr Cook and after-dinner remarks by Mr Mandelson. Yesterday there was a report by a Labour-dominated select committee about the cost (much exaggerated) of preparing to join the euro, the day before a gratuitous suggestion by Germany's foreign minister, Joska Fischer, that the time is coming when EU voters will elect Romano Prodi's successor as president of the European commission. The malevolence and ignorance of parts of the media on this subject cannot be exaggerated. But the awkward fact is that Martin O'Neill's select committee did indeed suggest that euro conversion might cost \u00a335bn. Mr Fischer did shoot his mouth off. The brutal fact is that the agenda for Nice is about little or none of the above. It chiefly concerns that so-called \"Amsterdam left-overs,\" the issues unresolved when EU leaders met in June 1997 - and Tony Blair won the bicycle race at his first summit. They are about how to make the EU work more efficiently and take decisions more quickly in readiness for the day - long postponed - when the first of 15 applicant countries, led by Poland and the Czech republic, start to turn the EU 15 into 20 or even 30 members. That means altering three things: \u0095 the number of commissioners, so that not every state automatically has one except those which currently have two, including Britain; \u0095 the way the council of ministers, the dominant force in the EU at present, counts its votes. Luxembourg with 400,000 people currently has two votes in council, Germany with 80m has 10; \u0095 trickiest of all, there is the need to reduce the number of topics on which the national veto is exercised, to expedite decision making because 30 vetos would be a nightmare. It is dangerous for Mr Blair precisely because it allows the Sun or Daily Mail to say Britain is poised to \"give up the veto on 40 issues\", as the Mail did yesterday. It did not help that the French EU presidency's working text for Nice, which surfaced in Whitehall yesterday, persists in wanting to curb the national veto on sensitive tax matters like VAT, excise duties and the anti-fraud \"withholding tax\". Labour has made clear it wants more majority voting (ie no veto) on many issues, such as the environment. But it will not yield on the five big issues of tax, social security, treaty changes, defence and border controls. There is no reason to think that it will.",

Sir Martin was one of a series of senior prison officers who failed to give accurate accounts of their role in the raid, seen by some as an attempt to punish the liberal regime run at the prison for resettling offenders. The committee called for a complete overhaul of the prison service, including an end to self-inspection of prison service management. The proposal is likely to be spurned by the Home Office which mounted a strong defence of Mr Narey, claiming he had acted in good faith and on the basis of intelligence. The report, revealing a battle throughout the prison service management between liberals and traditionalists, was being described yesterday as one of the most important into the prison service for a decade. It is expected that the report will lead to a stronger policy in favour of resettlement prisons, edging convicts into the community, a policy already being examined by the Home Office and the performance and innovation unit from the Cabinet Office. The commitee of MPs, including rightwing Conservatives, yesterday described the raid in May as disproprtionate, damaging and unjustified. The MPs asserted the night raid by over 80 officers from other prisons - some in riot gear - had destroyed the atmosphere of trust at the resettlement prison which has one of the lowest reoffending rates in the country. Named serving prisoners, unusually, cross-examined by the committee, condemn the new atmosphere at the prison.

The committee also concluded that Mr Narey misled the committee and the public in his evidence by claiming the raid had found \"a quite frightening amount of contraband\". A parliamentary written answer three weeks after the search alleged 98 finds of unauthorised articles, but was misleading since most of the supposed unauthorised items had been returned. Mr Narey also told the committee the raid had caused \u00a3400 worth of damage, but subsequently felt compelled to correct the figure to \u00a36,100. Internal reports prepared by the prison service into the raid lacked independence from the chain of command and rigour of approach, the MPs found. The prisons minister, Paul Boateng, was also condemned for failing to ask the chief inspector of prisons to investigate the raid. The report alleged that the raid was being planned by area prison staff two days be fore the home secretary, Jack Straw, wrote to the select committee to reassure them that Blantyre's future was secure. Mr Straw refused to condemn Mr Narey yesterday and said prison service staff had acted in good faith on the basis of intelligence available. He claimed the raid had found evidence of wrongdoing.

Back at his desk today after just two hours sleep, he said he was still baffled with the American parent group's decision to abruptly close the site with the loss of 64 jobs in the UK and 40 in the US. \"It was a huge great shock. We thought we were doing all that was expected of us,\" he said. Mr Pratley, who had joined from the Sunday Business, firmly believes there is still a future for a service offering online independent financial journalism for amateur investors. \"I hope the collapse of the site does not mean that good financial journalists are put off altogether from a career online.\" Street had 180,000 registered users but did not charge for its service. Mr Pratley said he still believed such an advertising-supported service was viable and the closure was not a reflection of the wider malaise in the internet market. He said the Americans had simply decided to cut their losses and retreat to a core business. \"We met every single financial target that was set for us. There is huge amount of disappointment that our US parent could not help us to continue as a going concern,\" he said. He said there were \"no detectable signs\" of a closure in recent weeks, adding there was huge disappointment that no-one from America had come over to break the news personally.",

Even when it was revived in 1988, it was hailed neither as a disaster nor as a lost masterpiece. I still don't know whether I enjoy watching it. </p> <p>The main problem is that Hans Werner Henze's score didn't suit Ashton, who had been hoping for music as \"radiant\" as the Mediterranean from which its heroine was born. He had wrestled with sections that were knotted and his discomfort shows in passages of dance that look rented by the yard. </p> <p>What also undermines the ballet is that its feet are placed, unsteadily, in both the 19th and 20th centuries. Its plot tells the quintessentially romantic tale of a man who falls in love with a bewitching water sprite and thus ruins forever his chances of becoming a regular, happy guy. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Ashton makes frequent reference to the 19th-century ballet repertoire. Yet he was also trying to be modern, so lodged among his ballet's delicate archaism are a couple of blockbuster dance routines which look like a cross between Soviet populism and Broadway. </p> <p>At the centre of this muddle, however, is the role of Ondine, and this is pure Ashton. No one else could have entered so naturally into the fantasy life of this na\u00efve, capricious character; no one else could have found a language of such glancingly bright surfaces and wayward rhythms. With the right ballerina the role can carry the ballet and on Wednesday Sarah Wildor proved she was a natural. </p> <p>Wildor's achievement is to create an Ondine who is not a pretty novelty but a genuine alien. On her first entrance into the mortal world, Wildor doesn't just impersonate Ondine's body language, she inhabits her nervous system. Terror, curiosity and enchantment eddy through her limbs in rapid succession, with barely a move that looks like a habitual human response. Even when she falls in love with Palemon she continues to occupy a different element, breath a more glittering air. And when that love is eventually doomed she looks as if a light has been switched off. Bedraggled and broken, she is like a character from an Andersen fairy tale: tragic but disturbingly remote. </p> <p>As her Palemon, Jonathon Cope never tries to breach the tame outlines of the role but there are details in his performance which make it warm and solid. Cope does bewitchment very well and we can feel the desire in his fingertips as he touches Wildor. Most importantly, he is a superb partner so that Wildor appears to slip through his arms like a mermaid, just as Ondine herself slips elusively through this difficult ballet. The role, like the sprite, is a lovely thing without a real home. </p> <p> In repertory until December 11. Box office: 020-7304 4000.</p>",

      "body": "<p>They were rioting at Leeds university and the man to blame was composer Simon Fell. The wizard of wilful discordance strolled on to the stage accompanied by a troupe of young, earnest music students and proceeded to baffle and enchant us with an hour and a half of violent sensuality. </p> <p>Fell's Composition No.57: Kaleidozyklen, receiving its world premiere, is the latest in a long line of works that have seen him wrestling with a bewildering array of self-inflicted musical challenges, not least of which is how do you get a large orchestral group to improvise freely around a system of musical notation and not end up making a meaningless racket? </p> <p>Somehow on this occasion, the university's contemporary music ensemble pulls it off. How they do it, or indeed what exactly it is that they are doing, remains a mystery. A written commentary is provided but it is full of phrases such as 'real-time xenochronicity' so there's not much help there. </p> <p>The piece is split into five movements and there is a central director and five sub-conductors. Instruments include brass, woodwind, a harp, electric guitar, piano, violins, a big drum and a double bass. The latter, played by Fell, is horrifically assaulted from beginning to end; in fact some of his scrapings sound like someone desperately scrabbling at the inside of a coffin lid.

      "bodyText": "They were rioting at Leeds university and the man to blame was composer Simon Fell. The wizard of wilful discordance strolled on to the stage accompanied by a troupe of young, earnest music students and proceeded to baffle and enchant us with an hour and a half of violent sensuality. Fell's Composition No.57: Kaleidozyklen, receiving its world premiere, is the latest in a long line of works that have seen him wrestling with a bewildering array of self-inflicted musical challenges, not least of which is how do you get a large orchestral group to improvise freely around a system of musical notation and not end up making a meaningless racket? Somehow on this occasion, the university's contemporary music ensemble pulls it off. How they do it, or indeed what exactly it is that they are doing, remains a mystery. A written commentary is provided but it is full of phrases such as 'real-time xenochronicity' so there's not much help there. The piece is split into five movements and there is a central director and five sub-conductors. Instruments include brass, woodwind, a harp, electric guitar, piano, violins, a big drum and a double bass. The latter, played by Fell, is horrifically assaulted from beginning to end; in fact some of his scrapings sound like someone desperately scrabbling at the inside of a coffin lid. Some members of the audience crane their necks, muttering 'how is he doing that?' while others just sit back and accept that there are some things they will never understand. The general mood of the work is glacial. Broken symphonic fragments float out at us from an encroaching blizzard. The insidious second movement is like trying to get to sleep with a malevolent voice telling you that you need to go to the lavatory.

Watching Patrick Marber's excellent revival, what astonishes one is the way a play, at once so familiar and so strange, yields new meanings through the chemistry of the particular actors. </p> <p>The surprise casting is Michael Gambon as Davies, the itinerant down-and-out. Partly because of the prototype performance of Donald Pleasence, one always imagines the character, offered refuge in a junk-filled room, to be a wiry figure. But Gambon has the bulk and size of a Dickensian grotesque. </p> <p>He offers the most physically repellent Davies I have seen - which, of course, makes all the funnier his attempts to cling to a pathetic dignity, as when he claims, \"I've had dinner with the best.\" But what Gambon brings out specifically is the chameleon-like nature of the dispossessed. Trained to a life of survival, this Davies shifts from ingratiation to aggression. When he turns on the brain-damaged Aston and warns him \"they can have you inside again\", it is with a downright cruelty that springs from deprivation. You never pity Davies; what astonishes is the unsentimental accuracy with which Pinter records his plight. </p> <p>It is a brilliant performance. But it never overshadows the other actors, nor does it prevent you realising that Pinter's play is both about the loss of identity that comes from social exclusion and the way we all cling to life-sustaining dreams. Davies's personal Nirvana lies in Sidcup where his papers are ostensibly housed. But when Rupert Graves's sleek, fly, property-owning Mick reclines on a sofa and talks of turning this tumbledown room into a penthouse, you realise that he is equally gripped by illusion. And as Douglas Hodge's kindly yet defiant Aston speaks of the shed he plans to build we are in the world of Gorky's or O'Neill's pipe-dreamers. </p> <p>This is the key to the play's greatness: it is about three lost souls who never fully know who they are and who, while mercilessly exposing others' illusions, are all in the grip of private fantasies. That is why the play makes sense everywhere from Cairo to Caracas. But the tone of Marber's production, given a design by Rob Howell full of rotting verisimilitude, is set by Gambon, who assumes whatever persona is necessary. </p> <p>Until January 13.
