This club is geared for top-level football and has a proven record. My job is to help bring back the good times to Ewood Park.

There will, however, be casualties, many of them. </p> <p>The rumour mill is already in full swing. It will say that Souness's first target may well be the gifted Liverpool striker Titi Camara. </p> <p>Certainly Walker will have to be at his most generous if he is to satisfy a man who has developed a fondness for investing other people's money at his six clubs. \"There is a big job to be done here and I believe we have found the right man to do it,\" Walker added yesterday. </p> <p>He has said that before, of course, but by appointing Souness he can at least rest assured he has hired a man of commitment, dignity, honour and, most important, enormous desire. </p> <p><strong>Career moves </strong></p> <p><strong> May 6 1953</strong> : Born Edinburgh <br> <strong> May 1970:</strong> Joins Spurs <br> <strong> Jan 1973</strong> : Signs for Middlesbrough.

This was a much-improved first-half display by County, looking for their first win since Boxing Day, a run that has seen them fall from a potential play-off side to relegation candidates. Claus Jensen produced Bolton's only first-half chance, a 25-yard free-kick which Stockport's goalkeeper Carlo Nash deflected round his right-hand post with a competent dive. Bolton, having weathered the best that County could throw at them, opened the second half in improved fashion, Dean Holdsworth connecting with a Paul Ritchie pass to lift an effort wide of the post. An impressive 50-yard pass from Fish sent Eidur Gudjohnsen sprinting down the right, his cross eventually breaking for Jensen, whose shot from the edge of the area was deflected for a corner. Bolton were in no doubt this was not their night when, later, Jensen's right-foot shot beat the wall and goalkeeper only to cannon off the bar.",

United are one win away from a quarter-final berth. Beckham has an early chance from the centre-left, 35 yards out. The ball falls inviting at the far post but Fiorentina manage to clear.<br><strong>3</strong> Gary Neville takes his eyes off Batistuta for a second and the Argentine international is able to fashion a strike from 25 yards on the left. The effort hits the side netting - an early sign of what this player is capable of.<br><strong>5</strong> A great chance for the visitors as Rui Costa is sent through one-on-one with Bosnich. The Australian keeper does enough and smothers the shot. The follow-up challenge is deemed illegal and United clear from the free-kick. The home side are still asleep at the back.<br><strong>7</strong> Fiorentina are very eager to press forward. Heinrich races down the left wing and forces a good challenge from Neville. United are having trouble getting their feet on the ball in this opening spell.<br><strong>9</strong> Giggs's determination in a tussle with Repka pays off as the ball runs his way. The Welshman squares to Cole on the left edge of the box. His control buys him enough space to shoot across the face of Toldo's goal, and the keeper's parry falls at Yorke's feet but the ball gets stuck underneath him and Pierlini is able to clear.<br><strong>12</strong> Andy Cole does all the hard work on the left. On reaching the by-line the cross is delivered to the far post where Beckham rises and somehow fails to make a telling contact into an empty net. Lots of United pressure after a shaky start.<br><strong>14</strong> Ryan Giggs recalls his FA Cup semi-final goal against Arsenal last year, turning two defenders on the left before pulling the ball back for Roy Keane, who slices his shot and manages to hit a defender's head.<br><strong>16 Goal: Manchester United 0 - 1 Fiorentina</strong> United should sign this guy purely to stop him scoring against them. Batistuta takes two touches before unleashing a wickedly swerving shot from 25 yards that beats Bosnich with pure venom. An excellent strike that gives United a challenge to rise to.<br><strong>19 Goal: Manchester United 1 - 1 Fiorentina</strong> Andy Cole drags United level with a goal of real class. Beckham's pass is chested down 5 yards outside the visitors' area. A smooth turn-and-shoot whistles through Repka's legs and beats Toldo at his right-hand post. This match could develop into a classic encounter. Cole has equalled the club record for European goals, drawing level with Denis Law on fourteen.<br><strong>23</strong> Heinrich almost profits from some head-tennis in the United area, but Beckham is back and clears for a Fiorentina throw from the right. United are able to regain possession.<br><strong>26</strong> United are enjoying good penetration down both flanks. Yorke spins away down the right and his lay-off is met by a deep cross by Beckham. No United players are able to meet the centre and Repka clears. There are more goals to come in this game.<br><strong>29</strong> A corner to Fiorentina from the left, to be taken by Rui Costa. The cross is hit towards the near post and Batistuta is able to manage the flick but Bosnich manages to save and hold.<br><strong>30</strong> Bosnich's clearance finds Cole on the left-centre edge of the Fiorentina area. After riding two challenges, he tries a clever chip that has Toldo racing backwards to tip the effort over the bar. The corner is a disappointment in comparison.<br><strong>32 Goal: Manchester United 2 - 1 Fiorentina</strong> Another United corner from Beckham on the right. A deep centre is met by Henning Berg who directs his header to Toldo's far post. The keeper is stranded and can only watch as Berg's header cannons off the bar and falls to Keane, who winds up and crashes the ball into the roof of the net from 10 yards. A great finish made to look easy when it was anything but.<br><strong>34</strong> Fiorentina look a little shell-shocked after the events of the previous fifteen minutes. Beckham springs an 'energetic' challenge on Di Livio and is booked for his efforts - he will miss the Valencia game next week which may well turn out to be an academic fixture.<br><strong>37</strong> Heinrich reacts badly to a late challenge from Beckham and resorts to some shirt-pulling. The ref has his eye on matters and lets it go. Beckham is bundled over on the next move by the same man and again the referee exercises restraint. The England international has to watch it as he's the one on the yellow.<br><strong>41</strong> Di Livio tries a speculative effort from 30 yards out in a central position. Stam and Berg dropped off him almost offering him the chance of a pop at Bosnich. He doesn't disappoint, spooning the ball into the crowd well wide of the goal.<br><strong>43</strong> United are moving the ball around well, with Roy Keane the lynchpin. Cole is exuding confidence and dropping deep to pick up the ball and take on Torricelli, who is having a torrid night dealing with the United frontman in addition to Giggs.<br><strong>46</strong> A great first half comes to an end with United well on top and Fiorentina looking dangerous on the break. More goals look a certainty for the second half.<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> Can both sides maintain the tempo and standard of play shown in the first half? Fiorentina restart the match.<br><strong>46</strong> Beckham a little casual as he loses possession to Heinrich on the left. His centre is met by Mijatovic, who hits his volley high into the Stretford End. Some accusing glances are directed at Beckham.<br><strong>47</strong> Rui Costa cuts in from the left after receiving the ball fairly deep and his effort from 25 yards centre-left is well struck but straight at Bosnich.<br><strong>50</strong> Giggs all the way again from the right wing this time, cutting into the centre, beating and outpacing one, two, three defenders before blazing his shot high over Toldo's bar.<br><strong>55</strong> A brilliant move by Keane and Beckham who combine on the right. The cross from Beckham finds Giggs. His header deflects off Repka for a corner. The centre from Beckham on the right is punched out unconvincingly by Toldo. Berg scuffs his opportunity and eventually Toldo is able to collect and clear.<br><strong>60</strong> A free header from Batistuta from a Rui Costa corner on the left that is almost too easy for the Argentine. His effort at the near post is horribly wide and he knows it was a great chance as for once United's marking was slack.<br><strong>62 Sent off:</strong> Rossitto (Serious foul play). An X-rated 'challenge' on the back of Yorke's right leg earns the Italian his marching orders. Fiorentina have it all to do.<br><strong>63 Fiorentina substitution:</strong> Chiesa for Mijatovic.<br><strong>66</strong> A corner to Fiorentina. Chiesa takes from the right but the delivery is poor. United clear and break through Yorke, who feeds Beckham on the right touchline. A trademark cross is aimed at Cole and Toldo does well to intercept the centre.<br><strong>68</strong> Giggs accelerates away from the half-way line until he is upended by Adani 25 yards from goal. The defender is booked and will miss the next game.<br><strong>69</strong> Beckham drives the ball into the Fiorentina wall, and the rebound is distributed to Scholes, who drives low and gains a corner off Repka.<br><strong>70 Goal: Manchester United 3 - 1 Fiorentina</strong> The goals are shared out as Dwight Yorke puts his name on the scoresheet. Beckham's corner from the right is overhit and Giggs returns the ball from the left to the far post. Yorke rises and heads across Toldo into the far corner of the goal.<br><strong>73</strong> United rip into Fiorentina again as Keane takes the ball all the way down the left wing. He squares to Scholes, who scuffs his shot. Di Livio and Keane contest a 50-50 ball a little too intensely for the referee's liking. Fiorentina clear from the free kick.<br><strong>75 Fiorentina substitution:</strong> Tarozzi for Toricelli; Amoroso for Di Livio.<br><strong>77</strong> Free kick to United from the left. Beckham takes and Toldo palms it way for a throw from the right. United build again. The home side are content to keep possession whilst Fiorentina have to chase the game with ten men.<br><strong>80</strong> The ball is threaded through to Cole on the right, who drills a low shot at Toldo from 20 yards at the right apex of the area. Toldo blocks with his chest and Adani tidies up.<br><strong>82</strong> United string ten, fifteen passes together before Dwight Yorke has his shot deflected off for a corner. The centre is played out to Scholes, who strikes a drive off Rui Costa for another corner. Nothing comes of the set piece.<br><strong>85</strong> A free-kick to United from the right, won after Tarozzi got tired of hearing the ol\u00e9s echoing round the ground following the home side's every touch. The set piece is wasted but United pick up possession easily after a poor Fiorentina clearance.<br><strong>87</strong> An opening appears for Giggs on the left side of the area. With Toldo to beat from 20 yards, his left-foot shot is dragged wide of the right-hand upright. The crowd want four and are disappointed.<br><strong>90</strong> The fourth official displays a wholly unnecessary three extra minutes to be played. Full time: Manchester United 3 - 1 Fiorentina.<br></p>",

      "body": "<p>People know the Joseph Rowntree Foundation for its studies into poverty and social problems throughout this century. But in its latest venture - the Caspar developments in Birmingham and Leeds - it is putting millions of pounds into shiny new apartments designed to help only those who can pay full market rents. So what is going on? Shouldn't the JRF be concentrating on people who could never pay the Caspar rents of \u00a3100-plus per week? </p> <p>The environmentalists certainly applaud high density construction in inner-city areas. Building here saves the greenfield sites beyond the suburbs. And short journeys to work mean less traffic congestion and pollution from commuters. But although we recognise the unsustainability of urban sprawl and the global consequences of increasing C02 emissions from cars, these are not the foundation's primary concerns. </p> <p>Some argue for a revival of private renting - the UK is completely out of step with Europe and the US - to meet the growing needs of single people not yet ready to settle and buy, or divorced and not in a position to take on extra financial commitments. And flexibility in the employment market means more job mobility and uncertainty - which makes renting a sensible option. </p> <p>Although small numbers of trendy apartments for sale are now coming on to the market, they are out of the reach of those whose incomes disqualify them for social housing but for whom home ownership is not sensible or not affordable at these prices. The Caspar projects should reveal the extent of this unmet demand. </p> <p>Since the JRF is acting here as an investor, not a donor, the projects should demonstrate to other investors that the time has come for a new style private rented sector. These totally unsubsidised developments can show a decent return - 6.2% indexed, plus capital growth - so the pension funds, insurance companies and others who have put billions into office blocks may be persuaded to consider investing in the new rented sector. Major investment in these rented homes would certainly ease other housing pressures. </p> <p>But even this is not the most important consideration for the JRF. Its central concern relates to the widening gaps between richer and poorer, increasingly expressed in geographical terms. Outside London, those who are able to have been moving away from our older industrial centres, leaving behind increasing concentrations of those on the lowest incomes - often living in council or housing association property. Tens of thousands of flats and houses in our northern cities are hard to let or empty, with rapid turnover and disintegration of community life. </p> <p>But it is not true that those who have left the northern conurbations have gone to live in the south-east: they have simply moved out of the major towns and cities. While the four northern regions together have been losing just 13,500 people annually (\"net outward migration\"), their six largest conurbations have been losing over 50,000 people each year. </p> <p>Most of the JRF's efforts on the regeneration side go to supporting ideas for neighbourhood management, greater involvement by local people, action for children and young people, ways of overcoming financial exclusion, better targeted and joined up local services, etc. But it is hard to create vibrant communities when the most common aspiration is to get out. </p> <p>If the urban exodus is to be reversed - if there is really to be an \"urban renaissance\", as Lord Rogers and his urban task force hope - then the fashion, the perception, the image of city living must change. Something has to attract and retain economically active people who are in a position to choose where they go. </p> <p>Cities will be regenerated by the people who live there. The hundreds of thousands of single person households that will be formed over the next 25 years - most with middle range incomes - are not so much a threat to the countryside of England as the potential salvation for the inner city. </p> <p>Single people are less bothered about schools and child safety. They are likely to work hard and play hard, making cities the places to be. And the urban ghettos of the US tell us what happens when down-town neighbourhoods only comprise the poorest and most disadvantaged: services become overloaded, good neighbourliness is overwhelmed, crime and violence can get out of hand. </p> <p>Attracting middle income renters, through creating accommodation to suit today's lifestyles, just might turn the tide and stop the city flight. The environmental and economic benefits are bonuses. The real success for the JRF's surprising investment in market renting would come from attracting that spread of incomes and skills which regenerates the social fabric of our cities. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Best is director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.</p>",

And short journeys to work mean less traffic congestion and pollution from commuters. But although we recognise the unsustainability of urban sprawl and the global consequences of increasing C02 emissions from cars, these are not the foundation's primary concerns. Some argue for a revival of private renting - the UK is completely out of step with Europe and the US - to meet the growing needs of single people not yet ready to settle and buy, or divorced and not in a position to take on extra financial commitments. And flexibility in the employment market means more job mobility and uncertainty - which makes renting a sensible option. Although small numbers of trendy apartments for sale are now coming on to the market, they are out of the reach of those whose incomes disqualify them for social housing but for whom home ownership is not sensible or not affordable at these prices. The Caspar projects should reveal the extent of this unmet demand. Since the JRF is acting here as an investor, not a donor, the projects should demonstrate to other investors that the time has come for a new style private rented sector. These totally unsubsidised developments can show a decent return - 6.2% indexed, plus capital growth - so the pension funds, insurance companies and others who have put billions into office blocks may be persuaded to consider investing in the new rented sector. Major investment in these rented homes would certainly ease other housing pressures. But even this is not the most important consideration for the JRF. Its central concern relates to the widening gaps between richer and poorer, increasingly expressed in geographical terms. Outside London, those who are able to have been moving away from our older industrial centres, leaving behind increasing concentrations of those on the lowest incomes - often living in council or housing association property. Tens of thousands of flats and houses in our northern cities are hard to let or empty, with rapid turnover and disintegration of community life. But it is not true that those who have left the northern conurbations have gone to live in the south-east: they have simply moved out of the major towns and cities. While the four northern regions together have been losing just 13,500 people annually (\"net outward migration\"), their six largest conurbations have been losing over 50,000 people each year. Most of the JRF's efforts on the regeneration side go to supporting ideas for neighbourhood management, greater involvement by local people, action for children and young people, ways of overcoming financial exclusion, better targeted and joined up local services, etc. But it is hard to create vibrant communities when the most common aspiration is to get out. If the urban exodus is to be reversed - if there is really to be an \"urban renaissance\", as Lord Rogers and his urban task force hope - then the fashion, the perception, the image of city living must change. Something has to attract and retain economically active people who are in a position to choose where they go. Cities will be regenerated by the people who live there. The hundreds of thousands of single person households that will be formed over the next 25 years - most with middle range incomes - are not so much a threat to the countryside of England as the potential salvation for the inner city. Single people are less bothered about schools and child safety. They are likely to work hard and play hard, making cities the places to be. And the urban ghettos of the US tell us what happens when down-town neighbourhoods only comprise the poorest and most disadvantaged: services become overloaded, good neighbourliness is overwhelmed, crime and violence can get out of hand. Attracting middle income renters, through creating accommodation to suit today's lifestyles, just might turn the tide and stop the city flight. The environmental and economic benefits are bonuses. The real success for the JRF's surprising investment in market renting would come from attracting that spread of incomes and skills which regenerates the social fabric of our cities. \u0095 Richard Best is director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.",

The move could put the devolved administration in conflict with Westminster and poses a tricky dilemma for the Welsh agriculture secretary, Christine Gwyther, who may be damned from Downing Street if she does and will be damned in Wales if she doesn't.

It is undignified, mildly bonkers and highly entertaining. </p> <p><strong>Ian Hamilton</strong>, in the <strong>Sunday Telegraph</strong>, elegantly set the scene: \"Both Greene and Walston were married to other people when they met. Greene indeed had a wife, a long-serving mistress and a prostitute-friend who liked him well enough to call him up at home from time to time. Walston, for her part, was a diligent seducer and had a small troupe of admirers at her beck and call. During her time with Greene - which lasted, at full pitch, for something like four years - she was also conducting affairs with a Labour MP, an American general and an IRA chieftain. And on the side, so to put it, she dallied enthusiastically with several priests. Like Greene, Walston was a Catholic convert, and priests, it seems, were her absolutely favourite sex toys.\" So far, so fascinating, but there was a sting: \"Cash's overall portrayal adds almost nothing to the versions we already have. And Walston, in spite of this biographer's exertions, remains fairly mysterious: as shadowy and implausible, it could be said, as Sarah Miles, the heroine of Greene's novel. But then William Cash is no biographer: his narrative is disorganised, his writing is clumsily pretentious, and he is forever pushing himself forward in one or another thoroughly ill-fitting guise... The trouble is that the tale he has to tell is simply not book-length, and he knows it. To pad things out, he jaws on about himself and about how much work he has had to put into this project, as if we should all thank him for doing us a wondrous favour. Well, we don't.\"</p> <p> <strong>Susannah Herbert</strong>, in the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>, was equally dismissive: \"Cash's rootlings in the archives have turned up a few new details of the lovers' shared life - he says the two exchanged marriage vows in Tunbridge Wells and that Catherine was once sexually aroused by the thought of St Therese of Lisieux - but these seem comically slight when set against the grand claims he makes for his quest. In truth, Cash brings little to the party but a puppyish enthusiasm and an unintentionally hilarious tendency to identify himself with Greene, both as writer and lover.\"</p> <p> <strong>David Sexton</strong>, in the <strong>London Evening Standard</strong>, mocked Cash's life-into-literature pretensions: \"The Third Woman, Cash says, is not just \"an investigation into one of the most remarkable secret love affairs this century\", it is also \"an enquiry into the creative debt that literature owes to adultery\". One of his tutors at Cambridge, Tony Tanner, wrote a study of Adultery and the Novel. Cash has simplified his argument into a belief that adultery is a kind of literary fertiliser. Adultery, he says sagely, \"can be bad for marriage but good for literature\". Indeed, he talks of it with such wholehearted enthusiasm, you might be forgiven for thinking that not only must all novelists be adulterers, but all adulterers must perforce turn novelist.\" </p> <p><strong>Humphrey Carpenter</strong>, in the <strong>Sunday Times</strong>, could evidently have done with more of Greene and less of Cash: \"Cash belongs to the regrettably growing school of biography that believes that the author should intrude himself into the narrative as often as possible. \"This book is a detective investigation,\" he announces at the outset, and goes on to describe himself (with a deliberate echo of another Greene book) as \"a burnt-out journalist\" looking for a subject after failing to write a novel: \"My career needed a fresh narrative, a new plot turn.\" In fact, for all his \"detection\", he tells us little new or of significance about the affair.\"</p> <p> By far the most hostile review (quite a palm) was by <strong>Oliver Walston</strong> (\"a farmer and writer\") in the <strong>Independent</strong>, but this was only to be expected as Walston is Catherine's son and has been conducting a spirited multi-media defence of his mother. Walston did not mince his words. \"This is an unpleasant little book written hurriedly and carelessly to cash in on Neil Jordan's film of The End of the Affair. It is badly written, pretentious, inaccurate, trivial, salacious and, above all, tawdry.\" Cash in - geddit? \"The only seriously interesting piece of information which Cash claims to have discovered,\" wrote Walston, \"is that Graham and my mother were married in a Catholic church. Well, not quite married, but sort of. Well, they took vows. Well, maybe they didn't. Well, maybe there was no priest actually present. The only thing Cash is certain of is that the site of the church is today occupied by a supermarket.\"</p> <p> The quote you are most likely to see on any future edition will be from the reliably idiosyncratic <strong>A N Wilson</strong>, who, in his Evening Standard column, called it a \"succinct masterpiece\", though there may have been a degree of Greene-loathing in his judgment (\"Why people esteem Greene, as a man or a writer, is now even more mysterious to me\"). </p> <p>Cash's website contains his critique of each of his critics. He shows particular contempt for Ms Herbert. \"Herbert displays her embarrassingly obvious lack of intellectual qualification to write about Graham Greene by reliably informing Telegraph readers that the results of my year of research across America and Europe are \"comically slight\"\". thunders Cash. \"She has no idea what she is talking about... Herbert's aggrieved and inaccurate review is a feeble effort to distort and falsify the record. Moreover, if the results of my investigation were so \"slight\", why did the Daily Telegraph make a not insubstantial offer to serialise The Third Woman?... Herbert should stick to covering parties.\"</p> <p> David Sexton also seems to have got under his skin: \"The aggrieved and bleating tone of his lazy prose clearly reveals itself as a deliberately malicious effort to falsify and distort the remarkable amount of original new material and evidence I have unearthed in the book. His sixth-form style effort at a hatchet job is done with the intellectual wit of a chaffinch.\"</p> <p> On and on he goes, flailing in all directions. The point about papers bidding for the serial rights of books they then trash is misplaced (often a rotten book can make a decent extract, and in any case rights buyers and reviewers are entirely - and happily - separate). As for the critics, they are more likely to be flattered than stung by his admonitions. Admirable though his spirit may be, his cause is hopeless: ultimately he only succeeds in making himself look bitter and foolish. But who knows - this may be the shape of things to come, the start of internet-based critical catfights. </p> <p>\u0095 William Cash's website is at <a href=\"http://www.williamcash.com\">www.williamcash.com</a></p>",

Indeed, he talks of it with such wholehearted enthusiasm, you might be forgiven for thinking that not only must all novelists be adulterers, but all adulterers must perforce turn novelist.\" Humphrey Carpenter, in the Sunday Times, could evidently have done with more of Greene and less of Cash: \"Cash belongs to the regrettably growing school of biography that believes that the author should intrude himself into the narrative as often as possible. \"This book is a detective investigation,\" he announces at the outset, and goes on to describe himself (with a deliberate echo of another Greene book) as \"a burnt-out journalist\" looking for a subject after failing to write a novel: \"My career needed a fresh narrative, a new plot turn.\" In fact, for all his \"detection\", he tells us little new or of significance about the affair.\" By far the most hostile review (quite a palm) was by Oliver Walston (\"a farmer and writer\") in the Independent, but this was only to be expected as Walston is Catherine's son and has been conducting a spirited multi-media defence of his mother. Walston did not mince his words. \"This is an unpleasant little book written hurriedly and carelessly to cash in on Neil Jordan's film of The End of the Affair. It is badly written, pretentious, inaccurate, trivial, salacious and, above all, tawdry.\" Cash in - geddit? \"The only seriously interesting piece of information which Cash claims to have discovered,\" wrote Walston, \"is that Graham and my mother were married in a Catholic church. Well, not quite married, but sort of. Well, they took vows. Well, maybe they didn't. Well, maybe there was no priest actually present. The only thing Cash is certain of is that the site of the church is today occupied by a supermarket.\" The quote you are most likely to see on any future edition will be from the reliably idiosyncratic A N Wilson, who, in his Evening Standard column, called it a \"succinct masterpiece\", though there may have been a degree of Greene-loathing in his judgment (\"Why people esteem Greene, as a man or a writer, is now even more mysterious to me\"). Cash's website contains his critique of each of his critics. He shows particular contempt for Ms Herbert. \"Herbert displays her embarrassingly obvious lack of intellectual qualification to write about Graham Greene by reliably informing Telegraph readers that the results of my year of research across America and Europe are \"comically slight\"\". thunders Cash. \"She has no idea what she is talking about... Herbert's aggrieved and inaccurate review is a feeble effort to distort and falsify the record. Moreover, if the results of my investigation were so \"slight\", why did the Daily Telegraph make a not insubstantial offer to serialise The Third Woman?... Herbert should stick to covering parties.\" David Sexton also seems to have got under his skin: \"The aggrieved and bleating tone of his lazy prose clearly reveals itself as a deliberately malicious effort to falsify and distort the remarkable amount of original new material and evidence I have unearthed in the book. His sixth-form style effort at a hatchet job is done with the intellectual wit of a chaffinch.\" On and on he goes, flailing in all directions. The point about papers bidding for the serial rights of books they then trash is misplaced (often a rotten book can make a decent extract, and in any case rights buyers and reviewers are entirely - and happily - separate). As for the critics, they are more likely to be flattered than stung by his admonitions. Admirable though his spirit may be, his cause is hopeless: ultimately he only succeeds in making himself look bitter and foolish. But who knows - this may be the shape of things to come, the start of internet-based critical catfights. \u0095 William Cash's website is at www.williamcash.com",

      "bodyText": "The government was defeated in the Lords last night when peers narrowly pushed through a Tory move to block any further parental ballots at grammar schools. There was further embarassment, underlining deep rifts within Labour over selection in schools, when the party's former deputy leader, Lord Hattersley, suggested that the ballot mechanism was prejudiced and inequitable, and attacked the education secretary, David Blunkett, for appearing to drop his opposition to selection. Mr Blunkett's weekend statement that he wanted to \"draw a line\" under the selection row undermined the entire credibility of the government in its pursuit of a coherent education policy, claimed Lord Hattersley. Peers voted by a slender majority of 166 to 161 to back an amendment, to an unrelated education bill, to end balloting of parents of pupils at grammar schools on whether they wished to take their school into the comprehensive system. Last Friday, in the first grammar vote since the government introduced the policy, parents chose two to one to preserve selection at Ripon grammar school in North Yorkshire. At the weekend Mr Blunkett appeared in an interview to indicate government reluctance to continue opposing selection. However, the education minister, Lady Blackstone, last night made clear that the Tory amendment made to the learning and skills bill at its report stage would be reversed when the bill returned to the Commons. While Tories claimed they were seeking to protect grammar schools from a \"pernicious war of attrition\", there are in fact no other ballots imminent, since the opponents of selection have yet to collect sufficient signatures from protesting parents at other grammar schools to trigger one. Lady Blatch, the Tory education spokesman, told peers that when the government introduced the system of gathering signatures to trigger ballots to determine the fate of grammar schools \"it was obvious that a relentless and pernicious war of attrition would be unleashed on these schools\". Lord Hattersley, insisting that the ballots must continue, nevertheless underlined the rifts in his party when he argued that the formula was \"rigged\" in favour of the status quo, since the fate of such schools was being determined only by parents with a pre-existing stake in them - a situation \"so prejudiced as to be ridiculous\". He warned the government that if it \"continues to develop a reputation for rigging ballots it may pay a terrible price if an election comes along which it can't fix before polling. \"The government needs to demonstrate its integrity on this matter, and its integrity is not underlined or emphasised when the secretary of state himself says he is glad the situation is now closed in Ripon, and he does not want to see an end to the grammar schools.\" Lord Hattersley said that Mr Blunkett's statement that he wanted to draw a line under the matter \"undermines the entire credibility of this government in its pursuit of a coherent education policy\".

      "body": "<p>The drive to recruit black and Asian police officers in the wake of the Macpherson report has borne scant fruit outside London, but the Metropolitan police can boast 184 such recruits in the past year. While that is still far off Jack Straw's 10-year target of a quarter of the 26,500 workforce, it hikes the black and Asian showing in the Met to about one in 25. </p> <p>Yet whether these recruits can be valued and retained, and whether their presence can make a difference, is a source of scepticism, not least among the officers themselves. Detective Inspector David Michael, who won a racial discrimination case against the Met but says he was then forced off sick by ostracism at work, began a sobering series of diaries by black and Asian police on Radio 4 two weeks ago, called Taking Note. And now a new novel by ex-policeman Ike Eze-Anyika promises to blow the lid off the Met's sealed and secret world. </p> <p>Canteen Culture, which won the Saga prize for a first novel manuscript by a black Briton, was written while its author was suspended from the Golders Green division, accused of assault during an arrest. Although he was acquitted at the end of 1997 and reinstated, Eze-Anyika was on sick leave with post-traumatic stress when he heard about his \u00a33,000 Saga award. He resigned last June, and is taking the Met to an industrial tribunal, claiming discrimination about the way the complaint against him was handled. He says the case \"should never have happened\". </p> <p>Now 30 and living in Clapham, south London, Eze-Anyika says: \"I went into the force with an open mind, admiring it and liking the idea of being part of the New Scotland Yard world elite.\" He smiles grimly. \"I saw myself principally as a police officer who happened to be black. But I learned that people will only see you as a black police officer.\" </p> <p>The sole black policeman in a team that stopped four white men for drink-driving, Eze-Anyika says he was set upon, racially abused and beaten during his attempt to arrest them. \"As a black officer at the scene of a crime, you're vulnerable. People hurl racial abuse, because that takes the spotlight off the criminal.\" Yet the men's accusations led to action being taken against him. \"It reeked of racism. If I was white, I wouldn't have been standing trial. But there I was, accused of beating a white man up.\" </p> <p>Born in London to Nigerian parents - his father a lawyer, his mother a fashion designer - Eze-Anyika went to a British school, while his parents and siblings returned to Nigeria. He joined them aged 12, but returned after a year of university, and signed up in 1992. \"I wanted to be part of something,\" he says. Advertising was aimed at black recruits. \"It was alluring to be part of a vanguard of black police officers, though a lot of my friends told me not to bother.\" </p> <p>Then began a \"slow burn\" of dis-illusionment. \"When you walk into a canteen where 1,000 police officers are eating, it hits you that you do stand out. It's like walking into a firewall.\" It is this canteen culture - \"a subculture within an overwhelmingly working-class culture\" - that he wanted to lay bare in his novel, to \"capture the police psyche, the way they think and speak; that's why there's a lot of swearing\". He adds: \"It's easy to modify your behaviour, mask your beliefs. But the canteen is a very safe place for police officers. Canteens, pubs and sitting in the front of a van - that's where you get an insight into what people are thinking.\" </p> <p>Based on his own experiences and those of other police officers, the book contains a barrage of racist, misogynistic and homophobic \"jokes\". \"It's a conformist organisation and a very macho culture; narcissistic, self- serving. And it's unbreakable: you're either in or you're out. You're in on the jokes and wisecracks, or you're not.\" </p> <p>Beyond revealing the targeting of what Eze-Anyika calls \"significant others\" (black, Jewish, female, gay), the novel shows how that tight, self-reinforcing culture militates against anyone rocking the boat, lending itself to corruption, incompetence and bad policing. The plot follows the disintegration of a team of officers used to petty corruption - from smoking spliffs and drink-driving police cars to post-curry punch-ups - till they hit the big time by confiscating a car with more than \u00a31m in cash and cocaine in the boot. Jazz, the black copper, is excluded from the conspiracy, his loyalty thought dubious. For the author, this reflects habitual suspicion of officers \"caught in the middle\". He says: \"You're either pitied or hated, and you're often required to stand and declare. When you turn up at an incident involving black people, they look to you to take their side. But my loyalties have to lie with the officers. They're the ones you work with on night duties, watching your back. But it's not a good feeling.\" </p> <p>While a bonding culture may be needed for the job, \"no one challenges the bad practices. It's cancerous; if that can't be changed, anything else is ephemeral and superficial.\" For him, suspension was almost welcome. \"I knew I was innocent. It was a relief to be out of what was becoming unbearable.\" Nor did he mind forfeiting his warrant card. \"It's like saying, 'You're out of the club, son.' But I didn't want to be in their club anyway. I was beginning to see through the veneer.\" </p> <p>It became evident that Eze-Anyika - who also did a law degree while suspended - would have to resign if his book was to be published. \"I was told I'd have to submit it to the Met for approval, which I thought was absurd.\" He went to a tribunal after quitting last year - he felt he had no support from the Met throughout the investigation. \"I was told it was like falling off a horse; you just get back on. They didn't understand what I'd been through. When I wasn't getting any answers, I lost all faith and trust.\" </p> <p>He is sceptical of change even after the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. \"None of what's being seen as change was a Met initiative. It's just that public opinion in middle England had gone against the Met. The very fact that police officers believe crime will go up means they think it's committed by black people. The average police officer isn't able to distinguish a black burglar from a black banker.\" </p> <p>Institutional racism is little understood, he believes. \"The same officers in the 80s are still there now. People won't use 'nigger' to your face, but there's a constant allusion to black people as IC3s [police jargon for black]. If a woman police officer goes out with a black man, she's labelled as 'liking IC3s'.\" For Eze-Anyika, the emphasis on reporting racist crime also \"misses the point\". \"The Met's turned the culprits into racist criminals; whereas, to me, it's the canteen culture - even if most officers aren't skinhead racists, they have a low opinion of black people.\" </p> <p>Nor is recruitment alone the answer. \"When the Met has a recruitment drive it's seen as 'lowering standards'; black people are not seen as having something genuine to contribute.\" An accredited officer, he recalls seeking advice about joining a specialist unit. \"Eighty per cent suggested the drugs squad. When I mentioned the Special Branch, they said, 'There aren't a lot of black people in Special Branch because it's not very easy to get into.'\" </p> <p>Now working as an IT consultant, having sold film rights to Canteen Culture, and planning more novels \"with a police theme\", Eze-Anyika feels he has moved on. But he warns: \"I'd dissuade any black person from joining the police and, looking back, I think I never belonged. What black people are saying is, 'We want the Met to change.' It's got to prove something to us, or I'd rather see an organisation that was 100% white and we knew where we stood.\" </p> <p>Canteen Culture is published on Monday by Faber &amp; Faber, price \u00a39.99.

They argue this will have the advantage over dearer borrowing costs of preventing a further appreciation of the exchange rate. Mr Brown has bought this argument before. In his first mini-Budget in 1997, he increased stamp duty on house purchases worth between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000 to 2.5% from 1%. For houses costing more than \u00a3500,000 the duty was increased to 3.5%. Further increases would go down well with hard-pressed manufacturers in the Midlands and North East, who feel the level of interest rates is being determined solely by events in the South East. But Mr Brown will have to be careful not to antagonise the growing number of middle class voters who live, or aspire to live, in houses worth more than \u00a3250,000. Higher stamp duty on home purchases may also make the jobs market less flexible by increasing moving costs. To soften the blow to Middle England, the chancellor could decide to reform stamp duty on share trading. The London Stock Exchange has been campaigning hard for the 0.5% duty on UK equities to be abolished, or at least reduced. Such a move would cement the City's competitive position in relation to other financial centres but it may also run the risk of stimulating a stock market which some believe is already in danger of overheating.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Margaret Morrissey</strong>, National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations <br> </p> <p> Are educational standards so low that the government wants to pack children into school for as long as possible? Or does it just want to grab a few headlines?In theory, this might seem a good idea, particularly if you're a working parent, but you've got to think of it from the child's point of view. Is there any evidence to show that lengthening the school day would benefit children? I suspect not. School is restrictive and regimented - not the right environment for children to be for most of their waking life. We don't want to see our children ill and burned out at 16.<br>Verdict: No</p> <p><strong> Geoff Conway</strong> Headteacher, Grey Court School, Richmond, Surrey <br> </p> <p> I think we're all a bit confused by exactly what David Blunkett is talking about. If it's an additional 10 hours a week on the school timetable, then that would represent a 40% increase in school opening hours. Is the government going to give us 40% extra resources to cope with that? I doubt it. And in any case, would the teaching associations accept it - it would be a huge change to working practice? If, on the other hand, he's talking about extra activities at the end of the school day, then many schools like ours are doing it already.<br>Verdict: No</p> <p><strong> Reva Klein</strong> Author of Defying Disaffection (Trentham Books) <br> </p> <p> If the government is serious about tackling disaffection in schools, then extending the school day seems like a particularly perverse way of going about things. To enhance children's learning, we need to make schools more interactive and develop thinking skills - not lock kids up for longer. Children need more support, and more opportunities for creative and play activity - part of growing up is about acquiring freedom and being given choices. Yes, let's give them options but let THEM decide what to do and when.<br>Verdict: No</p> <p><strong> Tina Perridge</strong> Working Mother of four <br> </p> <p> Schools are busy, noisy places, and I don't think it would be right to expect children to spend even longer in them. My children have always been tired by the time they come home, and I think expecting them to stay there until 5pm would be really unreasonable - I'd be very upset by it. Childhood is about a lot more than school - if they were there until that time, how would they enjoy the sunshine of a summer evening? We seem to be demanding more and more of our children all the time, and I worry that we're in danger of depriving them of their childhood.<br>Verdict: No</p> <p><strong> Prof Clyde Chitty</strong> Head of Education Studies, Goldsmith's College, London <br> </p> <p> Nine to five seems to be a very long working day for youngsters, if children are meant to be studying for the whole of it. However, I've always thought it good for schools to be open for as long as possible - if they provide a good environment for youngsters who, for example, need somewhere quiet to do their homework. I am all for schools opening at 7.30am to provide breakfast for deprived youngsters, for example. But to supply more time that is structured and disciplined - I don't think that would be helpful.<br>Verdict: Not necessarily</p>",

      "bodyText": "Margaret Morrissey, National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations Are educational standards so low that the government wants to pack children into school for as long as possible? Or does it just want to grab a few headlines?In theory, this might seem a good idea, particularly if you're a working parent, but you've got to think of it from the child's point of view. Is there any evidence to show that lengthening the school day would benefit children? I suspect not. School is restrictive and regimented - not the right environment for children to be for most of their waking life. We don't want to see our children ill and burned out at 16. Verdict: No Geoff Conway Headteacher, Grey Court School, Richmond, Surrey I think we're all a bit confused by exactly what David Blunkett is talking about. If it's an additional 10 hours a week on the school timetable, then that would represent a 40% increase in school opening hours. Is the government going to give us 40% extra resources to cope with that? I doubt it. And in any case, would the teaching associations accept it - it would be a huge change to working practice? If, on the other hand, he's talking about extra activities at the end of the school day, then many schools like ours are doing it already. Verdict: No Reva Klein Author of Defying Disaffection (Trentham Books) If the government is serious about tackling disaffection in schools, then extending the school day seems like a particularly perverse way of going about things. To enhance children's learning, we need to make schools more interactive and develop thinking skills - not lock kids up for longer. Children need more support, and more opportunities for creative and play activity - part of growing up is about acquiring freedom and being given choices. Yes, let's give them options but let THEM decide what to do and when. Verdict: No Tina Perridge Working Mother of four Schools are busy, noisy places, and I don't think it would be right to expect children to spend even longer in them. My children have always been tired by the time they come home, and I think expecting them to stay there until 5pm would be really unreasonable - I'd be very upset by it. Childhood is about a lot more than school - if they were there until that time, how would they enjoy the sunshine of a summer evening? We seem to be demanding more and more of our children all the time, and I worry that we're in danger of depriving them of their childhood. Verdict: No Prof Clyde Chitty Head of Education Studies, Goldsmith's College, London Nine to five seems to be a very long working day for youngsters, if children are meant to be studying for the whole of it. However, I've always thought it good for schools to be open for as long as possible - if they provide a good environment for youngsters who, for example, need somewhere quiet to do their homework. I am all for schools opening at 7.30am to provide breakfast for deprived youngsters, for example. But to supply more time that is structured and disciplined - I don't think that would be helpful. Verdict: Not necessarily",

The baby's kept you up yet again, with her squelching and squealing, tossing and teething, and worst of all that woeful under-achieving. No matter how many times you patiently recite to her, she just can't get a grip of Einstein's theory of relativity. Not even the basics. As for her languages - she's not even mastered French and Russian, let alone Japanese. Don't tell me, it's TRAUMATIC (and I don't use capital letters lightly). Then there's the music. Six weeks old, been played the classics all her life and she still can't distinguish between Beethoven's Rondo a Capriccio Opus 129 and Rondo in C. Stupid cow. </p> <p>Well don't worry. Help is at hand in the form of the Baby Einstein videos. They are enjoying their first media outings in this country, and will be released, through Abbey Home Entertainment, later this year. </p> <p>The videos are the creaton of Julie Aigner-Clark and her husband Bill Clark, who live in Colorado and have two young daughters of their own. Baby Einstein is designed to \"facilitate the development of the brain\" of babies from one month old onwards by giving them a gentle introduction to high culture and science - a dribble of Mozart here, a smidge of Bach there, chucked in with a few of Shakespeare's most baby-friendly sonnets. One more thing - the videos introduce babies to seven languages and have sold more than one million copies in the US. </p> <p>Julie Aigner-Clark is the type of woman you have to call Julie. Just like Julie Andrews. She tells me ever so softly and gently how she dreamed up Baby Einstein. She was looking for stimuli for her two babies, something that would introduce them to the beauty and creative potential of life, and the best thing on offer was Teletubbies. So Julie got to work, though she says she's the least likely entrepreneur in the world - at school she sat at the back of class reading poetry and dreaming of platting daffodils through her hair. </p> <p>Why Baby Einstein? \"Well, everyone aspires to having a baby Einstein, don't they?\" Maybe, but then again Einstein couldn't tie his own shoe laces and I wouldn't fancy having to tie up my kids' shoes every day before they set off for work. </p> <p>Julie tells me how the videos have worked for her children - five-year-old Aspen, named after the tree and two-and-a-half year-old Sierra named after the Madre. \"We're big nature people,\" she explains. Aspen is now at a school for gifted children. \"Aspen's Japanese is fabulous,\" she says. \"The first five years of life is the perfect time to teach children languages.\" What can Aspen say in Japanese? \"She sings Hands, Fingers, Knees and Toes.\" </p> <p>Baby Einstein features all the bric-a-brac of a baby's life: toys and hoops and faces and simple patterns hypnotically swirling lazily as lulling voices sing nursery rhymes or count to 10 in a hatful of languages. Not only are the videos so soporific that babies are bound to fall asleep, but this is marketing genius - how to capture the world with a simple DIY video. Julie must be getting very rich very quickly. \"We're getting there,\" she says with that lovely American openness. </p> <p>Baby Einstein does not attempt to teach seven languages, simply to introduce babies to essential words such as apple. Can Aspen says apple in seven languages? \"No,\" says Julie, a little disappointed, \"only Japanese and Spanish . . . actually, German too. And English, of course.\" </p> <p>I tell Julie that I've never managed to teach my daughters a thing, and Baby Einstein sounds the perfect package for thickos like me. And just think how proud we'll be when our kids toddle off to school and start their Sats, already proficient in Japanese. </p> <p>There are quite a few party poopers who think Julie has got her priorities in a twist. Take Jan Parker, co-author of Raising Happy Children (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a39.99). \"I don't want my children to be Baby Einsteins,\" she says. \"The most important lesson any parent or carer can give a young child is that they matter. Young babies who grow up believing that they are worth spending time with, playing with, being cuddled and responded to are learning much more that really counts than the child put in front of a video reciting poems in five different languages\". </p> <p>Parker says this form of hothousing, can easily backfire. She points to evidence that overuse of television or videos can lead to delayed speech, and lack of confidence in both children and parents. \"My fear is that this sort of 'educational tool' preys on parents' anxieties and vulnerabilities, rather than boosting confidence in the positive power of their growing relationship with their child. Children tend to learn most when they are enjoying themselves. To help them to learn, and to try, even when they are not assured of success, they need confidence and a sense of their own worth, and that's something that comes through interaction between human beings.\" </p> <p>Rubbish, hey, Julie? This emotional blather is all very well, but the woman obviously has no ambition for her kids. Disappointingly, Julie seems to think Parker has a point. Baby Einstein has not been a substitute for interracting with Aspen and Sierra, she stresses. \"Really, I'm a full-time Marm, couldn't be a more devoted mother, but the reality is sometimes I have to cook dinner or take a shower and when I do that I'd rather expose them to media that is developmentally apppropriate than garbage.\" </p> <p> She couldn't think of anything worse than Aspen and Sierra slumped in front of Baby Einstein all day long. No danger of that, though - only this morning she and Sierra went down the river to feed the ducks. \"If I can teach her what sink and float means by throwing things in the river then that means a lot more.\" </p> <p>\"This is not about strapping children into a chair,\" says Julie. \"Babies luuuuurve our products.\" And they don't push the children - not at all. \"Take Sierra, she's two and a half and she only speaks English. She does love the videos though. It has given her the opportunity to appreciate classical music in a way that is great for her. she'll tap out little things on the piano. I think she's more likely to be a composer than a linguist. Aspen's the innate linguist, and all these videos do is enhance innate skills. Sierra actually likes Bach more than Mozart, which is surprising.\" </p> <p>Have any dissatisfied customers asked for a refund because their baby has refused to grow into a genius? No, she says. \"The thing is, everyone who's had a baby wants them to be the cutest and smartest, so even if they are stupid they don't think they are.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p> Last May, nightlights went out all over Islington. A study published in the scientific magazine, Nature, had found that sleeping with a nightlight in the first two years of life was strongly correlated with short-sightedness later in childhood. The authors of the study concluded that \"it seems prudent that infants and young children sleep at night without artificial lighting in the bedroom, while the present findings are evaluated more comprehensively\". </p> <p>Panic. Could you risk switching off? Could you risk not switching off? Although some mothers took the view, perhaps rashly, that an increased risk of shortsightedness must be preferable to a sudden descent into darkness, their decision could be difficult to live with. Would their bespectacled children be sueing them for deliberate neglect in a few years time? More responsible parents, stoically enforcing the ban, had to endure the nightly wails of children who had never, until that helpful Nature report, known really dark, darkness. Would their child, in later life, blame them for hideous flashbacks to that night when their bedroom plunged from the familiar rosy pink, into pitch blackness? Not so much, perhaps, as those parents now blame the University of Pennyslvania for the baseless scare. </p> <p>Another study, also published in the journal Nature, has now found \"no link between night time lighting and the development of childhood myopia\", according its author, Karla Zadnik. \"In fact the proportion of myopic children across nursery lighting conditions was remarkably uniform.\" She says that \"parents should not concern themselves with this unfounded risk.\" </p> <p>The previous study seems not to have established whether shortsighted children's parents were also shortsighted. Parents who use nightlights might well be more likely to be shortsighted themselves. The new research, though reassuring, presents parents with a new dilemma. Could the sudden re-introduction of light be as disturbing to a sensitive child as last year's descent into darkness? Should they continue to save on electricity or take advantage of this wonderul opportunity to justify spending almost \u00a3100 on a glow-in-the-dark teddy?</p> <p> There is no doubt that nightlights make life easier: blundering into a child's room in the middle of the night you can spot the telltale puddle of vomit, make out where a missing teddy hit the floor; you don't have to suddenly dazzle a miserable infant with an overhead light, adding to the drama being enacted inside the cot. So, thanks, Karla Zadnik of Ohio State University. Time to move on. Heard about microwaves and what they may - or may not - do to your child's milk? </p> <p> <strong> Lumibear</strong> </p> <p>Standing, \u00a397; sitting, \u00a387; reclining, \u00a392. Available from Purves and Purves (020 7580 8223) </p> <p>Like some vast jelly baby, this moulded plastic teddy light comes in beautifully bright colours, is as big as a six-month-old and has a grotesquely realistic bottom. The latest addition to the range is the reclining lumibear (sitting and standing versions have been in the fanciest nurseries for months). When lit, the darker colours provide the most reassuring glow, and the plastic doesn't get hot, so no burned fingers . . . but \u00a392? No light can be worth it. </p> <p> Rating: 6/10 </p> <p> <strong> Maisy Magic Lantern</strong> </p> <p>\u00a329.99 from Urchin (01672 872 872 or <a href=\"http://www.urchin.\">www.urchin.co.uk.</a>)</p> <p>Lucy Cousins' adorable mouse and her chums spin slowly round, driven by the heat of the bulb. Know-it-all toddlers will notice that the sheep walks backwards (\"Why, mummy? Why? Why?\") In this tester's experience, carousel-style lights like these tend to break easily, but then the obsession with Maisy won't last forever either. The lantern stands 20cms high and is fitted with a 15w bulb. (If Maisy is not to your taste, urchin will soon be stocking a dim light that fades slowly off after 15 minutes.) </p> <p> Rating: 8/10 </p> <p> <strong> Tomy Fantasy Dreamshow.</strong> </p> <p>\u00a329.99. (Call 01703 662600 for stockists.) </p> <p>Hi-tech version of the carousel idea. Battery-operated, the \"dreamshow\" projects a parade of slowly moving animals on to the ceiling, accompanied by music (it comes with two CDs).

      "bodyText": "Last May, nightlights went out all over Islington. A study published in the scientific magazine, Nature, had found that sleeping with a nightlight in the first two years of life was strongly correlated with short-sightedness later in childhood. The authors of the study concluded that \"it seems prudent that infants and young children sleep at night without artificial lighting in the bedroom, while the present findings are evaluated more comprehensively\". Panic. Could you risk switching off? Could you risk not switching off? Although some mothers took the view, perhaps rashly, that an increased risk of shortsightedness must be preferable to a sudden descent into darkness, their decision could be difficult to live with. Would their bespectacled children be sueing them for deliberate neglect in a few years time? More responsible parents, stoically enforcing the ban, had to endure the nightly wails of children who had never, until that helpful Nature report, known really dark, darkness. Would their child, in later life, blame them for hideous flashbacks to that night when their bedroom plunged from the familiar rosy pink, into pitch blackness? Not so much, perhaps, as those parents now blame the University of Pennyslvania for the baseless scare. Another study, also published in the journal Nature, has now found \"no link between night time lighting and the development of childhood myopia\", according its author, Karla Zadnik. \"In fact the proportion of myopic children across nursery lighting conditions was remarkably uniform.\" She says that \"parents should not concern themselves with this unfounded risk.\" The previous study seems not to have established whether shortsighted children's parents were also shortsighted. Parents who use nightlights might well be more likely to be shortsighted themselves. The new research, though reassuring, presents parents with a new dilemma. Could the sudden re-introduction of light be as disturbing to a sensitive child as last year's descent into darkness? Should they continue to save on electricity or take advantage of this wonderul opportunity to justify spending almost \u00a3100 on a glow-in-the-dark teddy? There is no doubt that nightlights make life easier: blundering into a child's room in the middle of the night you can spot the telltale puddle of vomit, make out where a missing teddy hit the floor; you don't have to suddenly dazzle a miserable infant with an overhead light, adding to the drama being enacted inside the cot. So, thanks, Karla Zadnik of Ohio State University. Time to move on. Heard about microwaves and what they may - or may not - do to your child's milk? Lumibear Standing, \u00a397; sitting, \u00a387; reclining, \u00a392. Available from Purves and Purves (020 7580 8223) Like some vast jelly baby, this moulded plastic teddy light comes in beautifully bright colours, is as big as a six-month-old and has a grotesquely realistic bottom. The latest addition to the range is the reclining lumibear (sitting and standing versions have been in the fanciest nurseries for months). When lit, the darker colours provide the most reassuring glow, and the plastic doesn't get hot, so no burned fingers . . . but \u00a392? No light can be worth it. Rating: 6/10 Maisy Magic Lantern \u00a329.99 from Urchin (01672 872 872 or www.urchin.co.uk.) Lucy Cousins' adorable mouse and her chums spin slowly round, driven by the heat of the bulb. Know-it-all toddlers will notice that the sheep walks backwards (\"Why, mummy? Why? Why?\") In this tester's experience, carousel-style lights like these tend to break easily, but then the obsession with Maisy won't last forever either. The lantern stands 20cms high and is fitted with a 15w bulb. (If Maisy is not to your taste, urchin will soon be stocking a dim light that fades slowly off after 15 minutes.) Rating: 8/10 Tomy Fantasy Dreamshow. \u00a329.99. (Call 01703 662600 for stockists.) Hi-tech version of the carousel idea. Battery-operated, the \"dreamshow\" projects a parade of slowly moving animals on to the ceiling, accompanied by music (it comes with two CDs). The show lasts either three or six minutes (which baby do you know falls asleep that fast?). For the full effect, you need a white ceiling and a dark room so that when the show is over, your baby will be plunged into darkness.

Others will cling to the puerile melodrama that ITN's victory in the high court yesterday was that of Goliath over some plucky little David who only wanted to challenge the media establishment.</p> <p>But history - the history of genocide in particular - is thankfully built not upon public relations or melodrama but upon truth; if necessary, truth established by law. And history will record this: that ITN reported the truth when, in August 1992, it revealed the gulag of horrific concentration camps run by the Serbs for their Muslim and Croatian quarry in Bosnia.</p> <p>The law now records that Penny Marshall and Ian Williams (and myself, for that matter) did not lie but told the truth when they exposed this crime to the world, and that the lie was that of Living Marxism and its dilettante supporters who sought, in the time-honoured traditions of revisionism, to deny those camps existed.</p> <p>Of course Living Marxism was unable to offer a single witness who had been at Trnopolje, the camp they claimed to be a fake, on that putrid afternoon of August 5, 1992. Indeed, they were unable to produce any witnesses at all. Unlike any member of Living Marxism or their sympathisers, I was there with ITN's cameras that day. We went to two camps: Omarska and Trnopolje.</p> <p>Living Marxism does not like to mention Omarska: there, we saw little, but enough: skeletal men drilled across a yard and devouring watery stew like famished dogs before being bundled out. One man said: \"I do not want to tell any lies, but I cannot tell the truth.\"</p> <p>The truth emerged with time. Omarska turned out to be the kind of place where one prisoner was forced to bite the testicles off another, who had a live pigeon stuffed into his mouth to stifle the screams as he died in agony. The yard at Omarska was a killing field, prisoners obliged to load the mutilated corpses of their friends on to trucks by bulldozer.</p> <p>Trnopolje was a marginally less satanic place, some of whose prisoners were transferred from other hideous camps to await forced deportation. Others were rounded up and herded there like cattle, or had even fled there to avoid the systematic shelling and burning of their homes. Unknown to us when we pulled up on the road, in disbelief at the sight before us, it was the former group that was held captive behind the now celebrated barbed wire fence.</p> <p>At the time I paid little attention to what would become Living Marxism's myopic obsessions: such as which side of which pole the old barbed wire or fresh barbed wire was fixed. There were more important matters, such as the emaciated Fikret Alic's (accurate and vindicated) recollections of the night he had been assigned to load the bodies of 250 men killed in one night at yet another camp.</p> <p>If it is still of any remote interest, I will say this: I now know the compound in which these terrified men were held captive to have been surrounded on one side by recently reinforced barbed wire, on two sides by a chain-link fence patrolled by menacing armed thugs and on a fourth side by a wall. But so what? This was a camp - I would say a concentration camp - and they were its inmates.</p> <p>What does it take to convince people? The war ground on, the British foreign office and Living Marxism in perfect synergy over their appeasement of the Serbs while other, worse camps were revealed. The bench in The Hague issued its judgment on Trnopolje in 1997: a verdict that described the camp as infinitely worse than anything we reported - an infernal place of rape, murder and torture. Witness after witness confirmed this. The Financial Times enthusiastically re-iterated Living Marxism's claims of a fabrication, but published a hasty and grovelling retraction when it looked at LM's non-evidence.</p> <p>It was dispiriting to have to report that in the first year of what was proclaimed as the new united, democratic Europe such places as Trnopolje and Omarska existed. It was worse still to return to London and find an obscure group of supposed intellectuals putting such effort into trying to convince society that the camps had been a fabrication and that I had committed perjury when testifying to their existence and horrors at the war crimes tribunal at The Hague My friends and colleagues Marshall and Williams - brave reporters of the highest calibre - were being branded as liars. I suffered a whole lot less but there was a steady stream of hate mail. \"You piece of shit,\" read one letter from an LM supporter revelling in the destruction of Vukovar, \"probably a nasty little Jew.'\"</p> <p>Those most horribly insulted, of course, were the disbelieving camp survivors and relatives of the dead. I happen to believe that those who survive and are left bereaved by such monstrous crimes are owed at least one thing. They should be given back their lives by an admission that what happened happened. Their sanity requires that history records and acknowledges the truth of the atrocities that were committed against them and those they lost.</p> <p>Richard Tait, editor of ITN, realised that three things had to be reclaimed. One, the reputation of his correspondents and his programme. Two, the trustworthiness of front-line, on-site reporting in general. And three, the need to etch the truth about those camps into history. Tait was the man who in private and in his affronted, righteous anger used the words \"revisionism\" and \"fascism\" without blushing.</p> <p>When ITN sued in pursuit of these aims, the company of course ran the risk that such action would draw attention to LM's revisionism. But no one could have predicted the degree to which, rather than be dismissed as a foul revisionist trick, Living Marxism's claims would become a matter for voguish tittle-tattle among bored intellectuals on the sofas of the Groucho Club.</p> <p>LM played its hand well but the rot in the British intelligentsia made it easy for them to do so. LM succeeded in entwining the two issues of the libel writ and denial of the camps. Some of their supporters argued that they accepted the truth of the genocide but nevertheless felt compelled by ITN's supposedly heavy-handed use of the libel laws to speak out in favour of those who denied the carnage. But such distinctions were utterly unconvincing. Those who helped LM cannot fail to recognise that by doing so they also stirred the poison LM had dropped into the well of history, playing their own role in denying a genocide.</p> <p>By this entwinement, genocide was devalued into a \"media debate\", something to chitter-chatter about over grilled sea bass and pale Belgian beer.</p> <p>Hungry for controversy, a sizeable portion of London's intelligentsia lined up to support Living Marxism.

Fay Weldon, Doris Lessing, Harold Evans, Toby Young, and even a handful of contributors to this newspaper. A diverse coterie, eager to sip Living Marxism's apparently excellent claret at the ICA, to eat their canap\u00e9s and run alongside the rotten bandwagon of revisionism.

One could argue very cogently about the complete inability to understand fascism, about \"victim-hatred\" and the strong historical strand of British appeasement of Europe's tyrants, from Franco and Hitler to Milosevic. There was also a mutated strand of anti-Semitism in a lot of this, the Muslims being, in their way, the Jews of Bosnia. But the most tangible answer lies, I think, in the way revisionism works in a bored society, whether you are David Irving or Living Marxism. For just as the Serbs were the tinpot Nazis of the Balkans, so Living Marxism is the tinpot Holocaust denier, appealing to the same cheap slogans.</p> <p>There is at the moment a remarkable convergence of trials: ITN vs Living Marxism wraps up in the high court; in The Hague, four guards at the Omarska camp go on trial. And also in London, Irving's case against Deborah Lipstadt, for her book Denying the Holocaust, approaches its denouement.</p> <p>Like Irving, Living Marxism tried - and to a degree succeeded - in couching its argument on the reality of Trnopolje as a matter of free speech. This was LM's most grotesque deceit. Free speech has nothing whatsoever to do with LM's agenda. Although it denied it in court, Living Marxism - on this issue at least - is first and foremost an apologist for the genocide orchestrated by Belgrade. Thomas Deichmann, the author of the original LM piece on Trnopolje, was a defence witness for the camp-roving thug Dusko Tadic, who in 1997 became the first man to be convicted in The Hague for crimes against humanity - many of those crimes having been committed in Trnopolje and Omarska. One of Tadic's attorneys, Mikhail Wladimiroff, has since published his own revisionist views of Trnopolje in LM.</p> <p>Deichmann has also been a regular contributor since his original article: one of his less subtle efforts was a grovelling interview with the man at the apex of the Serb's genocidal command structure, Radovan Karadzic, on whose authority we went to the camps in the first place. Karadzic is not wanted in The Hague for genocide, but Deichmann's article was entitled \"War Criminal or Whipping Boy?\" No prizes for guessing which thinly-veiled conclusion Deichmann came to. LM's continuous flagellation, in successive articles, of us \"bloody liberals\" and \"cosmopolitan types\" who contested the genocide became almost tedious - while the views of the authors were more interesting.</p> <p>As is by now well-known, Living Marxism has become adept at finding or placing supporters in what it regards as influential positions in the media. This is all perfectly above board: the Times was desperate enough to offer LM's editor, Mick Hume, his own column. The signatories of LM's letters are familiar bylines across Fleet Street. But the pivot of Living Marxism's activities in the mainstream is, for some reason, the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has at times, backstage, been torn asunder by arguments over key positions held by the group's leading members.</p> <p>Two of these are a Serb called Laza Kekic, the author of some of the most virulent attacks on the \"bloody liberals\", and Joan Phillips, who also works under the name Joan Hoey. This is the text of an email that came my way from Kekic to Hoey, written after the Nato bombardment of 1995 that produced the Dayton agreement:</p> <p>\"The Serbs have come back from far more difficult moments in the past. In the meantime, should accept and swallow a lot and consolidate what's left. Can even do Eurospeak and fluff on about the Balkan peace and co-operation in the meantime. Then, at some future date, the obliteration of the Muslims, the Albanians, and last of all the Croats. That's my perspective. And there's little else left to say'.</p> <p>Indeed there isn't. The message was sent from Kekic's electronic address at the Economist Intelligence Unit on September 14, 1995, at 10.11am. Others in the series of emails involve chatter about gainful contact with David Owen and friendly journalists at the BBC and Observer.</p> <p>At one point during the trial, LM produced video footage shot by what it called Bosnian-Serb Television, which did indeed have a crew there that day. But these particular images, it emerges, came from a third camera, a camcorder held by a man in military fatigues I remember well; LM was serviced in that instance by Serbian military intelligence.</p> <p>The point is this: \"free speech\" has nothing to do with what is going on. Living Marxism's attempts to re-write the history of the camps was motivated by the fact that in their heart of hearts, these people applauded those camps and sympathised with their cause and wished to see it triumph. That was the central and - in the final hour, the only - issue. Shame, then, on those fools, supporters of the pogrom, cynics and dilettantes who supported them, gave them credence and endorsed their vile enterprise.</p>",

LM's continuous flagellation, in successive articles, of us \"bloody liberals\" and \"cosmopolitan types\" who contested the genocide became almost tedious - while the views of the authors were more interesting. As is by now well-known, Living Marxism has become adept at finding or placing supporters in what it regards as influential positions in the media. This is all perfectly above board: the Times was desperate enough to offer LM's editor, Mick Hume, his own column. The signatories of LM's letters are familiar bylines across Fleet Street. But the pivot of Living Marxism's activities in the mainstream is, for some reason, the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has at times, backstage, been torn asunder by arguments over key positions held by the group's leading members. Two of these are a Serb called Laza Kekic, the author of some of the most virulent attacks on the \"bloody liberals\", and Joan Phillips, who also works under the name Joan Hoey. This is the text of an email that came my way from Kekic to Hoey, written after the Nato bombardment of 1995 that produced the Dayton agreement: \"The Serbs have come back from far more difficult moments in the past. In the meantime, should accept and swallow a lot and consolidate what's left. Can even do Eurospeak and fluff on about the Balkan peace and co-operation in the meantime. Then, at some future date, the obliteration of the Muslims, the Albanians, and last of all the Croats. That's my perspective. And there's little else left to say'. Indeed there isn't. The message was sent from Kekic's electronic address at the Economist Intelligence Unit on September 14, 1995, at 10.11am. Others in the series of emails involve chatter about gainful contact with David Owen and friendly journalists at the BBC and Observer. At one point during the trial, LM produced video footage shot by what it called Bosnian-Serb Television, which did indeed have a crew there that day. But these particular images, it emerges, came from a third camera, a camcorder held by a man in military fatigues I remember well; LM was serviced in that instance by Serbian military intelligence. The point is this: \"free speech\" has nothing to do with what is going on. Living Marxism's attempts to re-write the history of the camps was motivated by the fact that in their heart of hearts, these people applauded those camps and sympathised with their cause and wished to see it triumph. That was the central and - in the final hour, the only - issue. Shame, then, on those fools, supporters of the pogrom, cynics and dilettantes who supported them, gave them credence and endorsed their vile enterprise.",

      "body": "<p>Faced with increasing demands and limited resources, health policy makers cannot escape the need to make choices on spending priorities. Health care rationing is a global challenge, and the key questions are who should be involved in making these choices, and how should the choices be arrived at? </p> <p>In a number of countries, politicians have taken a lead in being explicit about rationing. In the US, the state of Oregon was one of the first health care systems to go down this route. There, a doctor turned politician, John Kitzhaber, appointed a commission of professional and lay people to recommend a list of core services to be funded under Medicaid, the government sponsored programme of health care for people who are poor or on low incomes. </p> <p>New Zealand offers a contrast to Oregon in that the committee appointed by the government to determine core services refused to identify treatments to be excluded from funding. The committee took the view that priority setting was best approached not by limiting service coverage but by targeting services on those patients most likely to benefit. It launched a programme of work designed to draw up evidence-based guidelines, with the involvement of health care professionals. </p> <p>The experience of New Zealand is echoed in the Netherlands. Although some services, such as adult dental care, have been excluded from insurance coverage, most effort has gone into encouraging a culture of evidence-based medical practice. The rationale is that few, if any, treatments offer no benefits to patients and rationing is likely to be more defensible if guidelines are adopted to promote the provision of appropriate care. </p> <p>An example is infertility treatment. In the Netherlands, women under 40 are entitled to three cycles of in vitro fertilisation. If they do not conceive at the end of three cycles, then the cost of further treatment becomes a matter of personal responsibility. In this case, the guideline is based on an analysis of clinical research pointing to evidence that treatment beyond three cycles is unlikely to be effective. </p> <p>If rationing in other countries has relied on the results of research, it has also involved consultation with the public and patients' organisations. In Oregon, a combination of public hearings, community meetings, telephone surveys and focus groups were used to engage the public. Similar methods have been employed in New Zealand and the Netherlands with the aim of both informing the public about the need to set priorities and drawing on the public's views to assist decision making. </p> <p>Many rationing decisions are likely to be contested and it is incumbent on decision makers to show that they have made their choices as a result of due process. This explains the work done in different countries to develop rigorous decision making processes in order to earn legitimacy for contested choices. </p> <p>In the UK, the newly-established National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice), set up to advise the government on the funding of health technologies, will need to draw on international experience to win credibility in discharging its functions. Nice will have to be watertight in its use of the results of research on clinical and cost effectiveness. It will also have to find ways of engaging the public and patients' groups. If consensus on rationing decisions is likely to be the exception rather than the rule, then Nice will need to show that it has paid attention to all relevant issues in putting forward its recommendations. </p> <p>The most important lesson for the UK from international experience is that being explicit tends to draw more resources into health care. Far from restricting coverage to a basic set of core services, those who have confronted the challenge of explicit rationing have strengthened their hand in the budget setting process within government. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Ham is director of the Health Services Management Centre at Birmingham university and Angela Coulter is chief executive of Picker Institute Europe. Their new book, The Global Challenge of Health Care Rationing, on which this article is based, has just been published by Open University Press, paperback price \u00a319.99.</p>",

It launched a programme of work designed to draw up evidence-based guidelines, with the involvement of health care professionals. The experience of New Zealand is echoed in the Netherlands. Although some services, such as adult dental care, have been excluded from insurance coverage, most effort has gone into encouraging a culture of evidence-based medical practice. The rationale is that few, if any, treatments offer no benefits to patients and rationing is likely to be more defensible if guidelines are adopted to promote the provision of appropriate care. An example is infertility treatment. In the Netherlands, women under 40 are entitled to three cycles of in vitro fertilisation. If they do not conceive at the end of three cycles, then the cost of further treatment becomes a matter of personal responsibility. In this case, the guideline is based on an analysis of clinical research pointing to evidence that treatment beyond three cycles is unlikely to be effective. If rationing in other countries has relied on the results of research, it has also involved consultation with the public and patients' organisations. In Oregon, a combination of public hearings, community meetings, telephone surveys and focus groups were used to engage the public. Similar methods have been employed in New Zealand and the Netherlands with the aim of both informing the public about the need to set priorities and drawing on the public's views to assist decision making. Many rationing decisions are likely to be contested and it is incumbent on decision makers to show that they have made their choices as a result of due process. This explains the work done in different countries to develop rigorous decision making processes in order to earn legitimacy for contested choices. In the UK, the newly-established National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice), set up to advise the government on the funding of health technologies, will need to draw on international experience to win credibility in discharging its functions. Nice will have to be watertight in its use of the results of research on clinical and cost effectiveness. It will also have to find ways of engaging the public and patients' groups. If consensus on rationing decisions is likely to be the exception rather than the rule, then Nice will need to show that it has paid attention to all relevant issues in putting forward its recommendations. The most important lesson for the UK from international experience is that being explicit tends to draw more resources into health care. Far from restricting coverage to a basic set of core services, those who have confronted the challenge of explicit rationing have strengthened their hand in the budget setting process within government. \u0095 Chris Ham is director of the Health Services Management Centre at Birmingham university and Angela Coulter is chief executive of Picker Institute Europe.

      "body": "<p>Government ministers have said that they are reviewing the way social security money called preserved rights (PRs) is spent. These are payments to keep those people living in care homes on benefit who were there before the rules were changed in April 1993. People entering care homes after that date receive much lower levels of income support and have their care costs met by local authorities (after a care and financial assessment), with the client possibly making a financial contribution depending on circumstances. </p> <p>So, elderly people with PRs living in care homes are usually cost-free to LAs, and \"younger\" people (that is, under pensionable age) in homes have their care costs (ranging up to \u00a3343 per week) met by the DSS. Since 1993, the number of elderly people on PRs has declined and younger disabled people now form the bulk of recipients. However, what started out as a support system has now become a trap for both groups (especially in the south-east). PRs payments no longer even cover basic care home costs for older people, but regulations prevent LAs from \"topping up\" (that is, paying the fee shortfall) for older people on PR. </p> <p>There is evidence that this group may fare less well than their LA-funded post-1993 equivalents in terms of room quality, en suite facilities, access to single rooms, etc. They are, in practice, outside the LA's contract with the care home and the purchasing power of the LA ensures the best deal for its \"own customers\". Preserved rights now preserve inequity for this group. </p> <p>Also, although many younger disabled people do have their care costs \"topped up\" by LAs, but find that if they move out of residential care they will lose their PRs, increa sing the cost to the LAs. Not surprisingly, many users and their families are reluctant to move and lose their PRs, even if local possibilities arise, and many LAs are not exactly pushing for such moves, because of the extra cost to them it involves. </p> <p>So, having started out as a good idea, seven years later PRs are now seen by some as part of the problem.

      "bodyText": "Government ministers have said that they are reviewing the way social security money called preserved rights (PRs) is spent. These are payments to keep those people living in care homes on benefit who were there before the rules were changed in April 1993. People entering care homes after that date receive much lower levels of income support and have their care costs met by local authorities (after a care and financial assessment), with the client possibly making a financial contribution depending on circumstances. So, elderly people with PRs living in care homes are usually cost-free to LAs, and \"younger\" people (that is, under pensionable age) in homes have their care costs (ranging up to \u00a3343 per week) met by the DSS. Since 1993, the number of elderly people on PRs has declined and younger disabled people now form the bulk of recipients. However, what started out as a support system has now become a trap for both groups (especially in the south-east). PRs payments no longer even cover basic care home costs for older people, but regulations prevent LAs from \"topping up\" (that is, paying the fee shortfall) for older people on PR. There is evidence that this group may fare less well than their LA-funded post-1993 equivalents in terms of room quality, en suite facilities, access to single rooms, etc. They are, in practice, outside the LA's contract with the care home and the purchasing power of the LA ensures the best deal for its \"own customers\". Preserved rights now preserve inequity for this group. Also, although many younger disabled people do have their care costs \"topped up\" by LAs, but find that if they move out of residential care they will lose their PRs, increa sing the cost to the LAs. Not surprisingly, many users and their families are reluctant to move and lose their PRs, even if local possibilities arise, and many LAs are not exactly pushing for such moves, because of the extra cost to them it involves. So, having started out as a good idea, seven years later PRs are now seen by some as part of the problem. PRs produce pressures to maintain the status quo, keep dependency and stifle innovation - but change is problematic because they are still very popular with users and families. The difficulty facing the government is that simply withdrawing such payments (currently made as of right) is bound to enrage an already prickly and vociferous disabled lobby, seeing it as yet another assault on the precious few real levers of power they have.

      "bodyText": "Pills that let you take a vindaloo curry and a lot of beer without so much as a polite burp are a runaway success. They are gaining \"lifestyle drug\" status among foodies and boozers, amid fears that they are being hugely over-prescribed by doctors. The drugs, known as proton inhibitors (PPIs), stop production of stomach acid. They are licensed to treat inflammation and ulcers in the gullet caused by acid splashing up through the food pipe, or gastric reflux. Indigestion can be triggered by greasy or spicy food, eating too fast, smoking, heavy drinking and becoming overweight. But the new pills are so effective that they allow people to over indulge. They have become so popular that some doctors fear they are seen as a passport to long-term unhealthy living rather than a short-term treatment for ulcers. There are concerns too that prolonged use can mask danger signs, such as cancer symptoms. The drugs - including Losec, Zoton, Protium and Pariet - are relatively cheap, at about \u00a31 a day. But with two million users at any one time, costs have leapt from \u00a350m in 1992 to an estimated \u00a3400m last year. An investigation by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice) into their use begins this month. Nice established its creden tials by barring NHS prescribing of the anti-flu drug Relenza because few old people took part in trials. The watchdog could be equally forthright with the tummy tablets. A department of health source said: \"PPIs are often prescribed inappropriately.

Times changed and she opened her first shop in Urumqi in 1982. Only 10 years later her first multi-storey commercial building was completed.

She was such a success that the government appeared willing to overlook the fact that Mrs Kadeer was also the mother of 11 children when the official limit is one.

The one thing that had changed in her life since the height of her success was that, in 1996, her second husband, Sidik Rouzi, fled to the United States (after an anti-government article that he had written was published in a local newspaper) and was granted political asylum. Since then he has given evidence on Chinese human rights abuses to congress. The couple's five children have left China and are living with their father.</p> <p>After her husband's flight Mrs Kadeer's passport was confiscated and, in December 1997 she was taken in by the police for questioning.

The logo of Powell and Pressburger's Archers company was an image of arrows piercing a bullseye; it's seen at the start of their films together, and of Powell's 1960 film as a solo director, the notorious Peeping Tom. </p> <p>Peeping Tom is full of piercings, culminating in what's effectively a symbolic stab right in the film-maker's eye. Its serial killer anti-hero uses his movie camera as a weapon: it's equipped with a stiletto and a distorting mirror. He simultaneously kills and films women, showing them their own fear in the reflection of their screaming faces. He finally commits suicide, plunging the stiletto into his throat, while gazing at his own terrified reflection. Peeping Tom effectively ended Powell's career. Critics found it hard to believe that anything so sordidly psychosexual had been made in Britain - it took the later efforts of fans such as Martin Scorsese to rehabilitate him. </p> <p>Peeping Tom has now been remade - at least, parts of it have - as an installation by an artist who shares the name of Powell's murderer-voyeur, Mark Lewis. Peeping Tom, by Mark Lewis 2 (let's call him), re-creates the footage shot in the original by the amateur auteur Mark Lewis 1. We see restaged sequences including Mark's killing of a prostitute; the crime scene the next day; the dance performed by the Moira Shearer character just before her murder; and Mark's suicide - the key piece of footage that we never see in Powell's film. </p> <p>Mark Lewis 2 has used some of Powell's original London locations, and retained the costume conventions of 1960, although they now take on a retro feel. His footage is in vibrant colour, close to Powell's palette, rather than Mark Lewis 1's black and white. It's also elegantly edited: where the fictional Mark left his images in a raw state, his successor uses fades and fast montage sequences, the images recurring rhythmically. This is less a remake, more a trailer for the film that the homicidal director never completed. </p> <p>But what kind of film was the murderous Mark making? Played by Carl Boehm, Mark talks about making a \"perfect film\". At one point, he refers to it as a documentary; at others, it seems to be fiction. According to Peeping Tom's writer Leo Marks, Lewis's film actually had a story; Marks once confided its subject to Martin Scorsese, who agreed to keep the secret. We can only speculate about its nature: avant-garde confessional, quasi-New Wave fiction-reality melding, or even, with the killing of the dancer Vivian, a pioneering stab at a snuff musical? </p> <p>What Lewis 2 hasn't remade is Powell's other home-movie footage: the films made by Mark's scientist father, recording the scientific experiments that used his terrified son as a guinea pig. One thing the critics found especially unsavoury was that Lewis Senior was played in these sequences by Powell himself, with his own son as the young Mark. </p> <p> The new Peeping Tom is less about voyeurism than about repetition, and is part of the current trend among artists to use existing films as material for speculative remakes. Films about repetition clearly lend themselves to this treatment: last year's Hitchcock exhibition in Oxford included Stan Douglas's looped re-creation of a scene from the kleptomania story Marnie, and Pierre Huyghe's spartan shot-by-shot remake of Rear Window. In its elegant production values, Lewis's film is closer to Gus Van Sant's misunderstood Psycho - which is better viewed as big- budget conceptual art than as a standard Hollywood remake. Lewis is already a specialist at this game: another of his works re-creates the opening of Orson Welles's Touch of Evil - upside down. </p> <p>Lewis has said that a prime concern in his Peeping Tom is the question of signature in film. Is Mark Lewis the artist producing a pastiche of Powell's film-within-a-film, or plagiarising the work of a dead fictional film-maker called Mark Lewis (who, as a murderous obsessive, perhaps surrenders any conventional claims to being considered an auteur)? Interestingly enough, the Mark Lewis character whom we see killing himself in Peeping Tom (2000) is not played by the living artist Mark Lewis.

      "body": "<p><strong>1 Rediscover his own form and wake up Shivnarine Chanderpaul</strong></p> <p> Adams's nickname, Hardcore, is a reference to his mental toughness, not his taste in movies. He's got to rediscover the focus that saw him ranked as the world's best batsman in the mid-1990s. A career average of 45-plus is nothing to be ashamed of, but it was an unreal 70 after about 20 Tests, and well over 60 halfway through his 49-match career. It couldn't last, but the steepness of the decline has been worrying. It's not just figures - he looks nothing like the adhesive player of old, and his batting technique has deteriorated. His decline is one of the main reasons for the Windies' recent batting failures, because he should be the perfect foil for the flair players. The other steady, unflashy leftie in the side has been unable to build the long innings he's capable of. A shy, quiet man when he first came into the side, Chanderpaul is discovering that attention and adulation can be difficult to handle. Observers in Guyana say he hasn't been the same since the embarrassing incident in which he accidentally shot a policeman, who surprised him and a \"friend\" on Georgetown's sea wall - the town's Lovers Lane. Get him to concentrate fully on what he does best, Jimmy. </p> <p><strong>2 Bring out the best in Brian Lara </strong></p> <p>It'll mean finding out real quick from the great man how short his \"short break\" from cricket really is. At the very least he won't be involved in the home series against Zimbabwe. Lara needs to say whether he'll be missing the Pakistan series too. Planning's got to go on and the side's got to be built. He'll have to explain too why he was jumping up in Trinidad's carnival while the other players were preparing to sweat it out for the cause. He and Adams get on well, because the Jamaican is the ultimate team player: friendly and keen, even when things are not going well on the field. Adams was the first to charge from the dressing room and lift Lara into the air when he made that astonishing 153 not out to win the Barbados Test against Australia last year. But Lara seems to have the Ken Livingstone problem: he cannot be part of a team he doesn't lead. Witness the disgraceful way in which he undermined Richie Richardson while campaigning for the captaincy. Richardson and manager Wes Hall could barely control him on the 1995 England tour. Dermot Reeve found him a handful at Warwickshire too. Have you grown up and are you ready to lead the batting, Brian? Adams deserves an answer. </p> <p><strong>3 Deliver instant success to a cricketing nation that's used to it </strong></p> <p> Very tough. There's no escaping the fact that the Windies are a bad side. Caribbean fans should not expect an instant turnaround, but they will. No disrespect to Zimbabwe, but Adams is lucky that it's them first up, and not either of the two outstanding sides at the moment, Australia and South Africa. He's also fortunate that the Windies' next opponents are Pakistan, who are even more unsettled than usual with a new captain in Moin Khan and following the noisy departure of coach Intikhab Alam. Add to this the West Indies' record at home, where they have remained almost unbeatable, and instant success is a possibility. But it's consistency and their tendency to go to pieces on tour that I worry about. </p> <p><strong>4 Get the young players to fulfil their potential</strong></p> <p> Several are in the frame, a few are Jamaican, and Adams is their captain. The left-handed opener Chris Gayle was one of the best players in the recent Busta Cup - the Windies' first-class competition - and is a possibility for a place in the middle order with Lara out. The Barbadian opening pair of Sherwin Campbell and Adrian Griffith didn't do too badly in New Zealand, where the others failed. Of the other Adams charges, Wavell Hinds looks a classy batsman, and much is expected of the hard-hitting Ricardo Powell. They're players he knows well, and, with sympathetic handling, he may be able to help develop them into consistent performers on the international stage. The problem is that there are too many left-handers in the mix and the Windies will be easier to bowl at. Adams may even get another of his cup-winning players, Franklyn Rose, to break through to the next level. Rose has bowled well when he's been in the side, but he's got a poor disciplinary record, and has not made the progress he should. Reon King came after him and has overtaken him in the queue. He should do better under his country captain. </p> <p><strong>5 Gracefully phase out Ambrose and Walsh</strong></p> <p> Adams should, on the other hand, get a fitting final fling out of Courtney Walsh. One of cricket's hard men has been prone to injury lately, and he'll need skilful handling to help him break Kapil Dev's Test record of 434 wickets, which is just nine away. Ditto Curtly Ambrose. England should realistically be the end of the road for both of them. It's Adams's job to make that clear to them, and at the same time encourage them to bowl as well as they ever have for old times' sake. Breaking the record and bowing out will generate emotional highs that can lift the team. In that short period Rose, King, Dillon et al will have to be made aware that they're about to inherit a great legacy. That twin task will not be easy. Adams will need a lot of good luck wishes. </p> <p><em>Orin Gordon, born and brought up in Guyana, has lived in London for five years and currently works as a broadcast journalist.</em> </p>",

As Bergman signs the bill, the waiter looks across at Wigand. Their eyes meet. The waiter looks away before leaving. Lowell pours. \"Cream or black?\" \"Black.\" Wigand glances at his watch impatiently. \"Look, I really don't have that much time.\" Bergman nods. \"Anything you want to know about me, Mr Wigand?\" \"Like what? Your sign?\" Bergman smiles. Wigand does not. \"I know what I have to know.\" Bergman makes sure to catch Wigand's eye. \"Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence it stays that way.\" Wigand looks up. \"How did a radical end up at CBS?\" \"I still do the tough stories. And CBS has Sixty Minutes - it reaches a lot of people.\" For a moment, Wigand's eyes wander. \"Let's see the documents...\" See also: Barton Fink, King Of New York, Some Like It Hot Don't see also: Four Rooms Pointless trivia: Insider director Michael Mann wrote episodes of Starsky and Hutch.",

It boasted a huge repertory, world-class dancers and a permanent base in the revamped Opera House, yet it lacked the confidence of its golden years under Ninette de Valois and Frederick Ashton, and had no obvious plan for the future. Clearly a shake-up was needed, but opinion was divided over who should administer it - a major artist who would reinvent the company in his or her own image; a radical impresario in the Diaghilev mould; or a leader with a steady hand. Ross Stretton, the 48-year-old who has just been appointed the Royal's new director, would, I think, regard himself as the last. </p> <p>Talking over the phone yesterday, Stretton made it clear that he was wary of broadcasting a grand agenda. He doesn't officially start till 2001 and his current job directing the Australian Ballet hasn't brought him into close contact with the Royal. As he says, \"I have to wait until I can get to know the dancers, assess their needs and see what motivates them before I come to any big decisions.\" </p> <p>The broad picture that Stretton outlines is one of balance rather than revolution. To those concerned for the Royal's classical heritage he offers soothing words: \"The classical language, in its purity and beauty, forms the base of any great company. Of course I'll be looking after the classics.\" He also says that historic links between the Royal and Australian ballets mean that he's very familiar with the British 20th-century classics. </p> <p>Equally, Stretton is quick to insist that he's no museum curator - \"Ballet needs to keep step with the other arts\" - and sees \"strengthening the modern repertory\" as an essential part of his job. Asked which choreographers he has in mind, he cites some obvious names (Nacho Duato, Jiri Kylian, Twyla Tharp, Angelin Preljocaj and William Forsythe) but adroitly concludes, \"I could rattle off a whole lot more, but until I get to know the dancers and the repertory it doesn't make sense.\" </p> <p>The names he does mention are stars of the international repertory, and one big concern has been that the Royal might lose its distinctive British identity. Stretton promises that he'll maintain the emphasis on home-grown choreographers, then adds, somewhat optimistically, that he thinks the identity of the Royal is a given. \"You only have to look at a dancer like Darcey [Bussell] to see the training and traditions of the company. Any dancer who enters the company from outside will inevitably become part of that.\" </p> <p>Critics who feel that the Royal's style has been diluted in recent years may roll their eyes, but Stretton obviously sees tradition as evolving rather than static. \"The dancers today are not the same as they were 50 years ago; they are young, fresh, vibrant and energetic.\" </p> <p>Stretton knows that running a national ballet company requires him to be a three-headed monster. \"As a director I have to be in the studio teaching the dancers, but at the same time, I have to have a repertory to teach, so I've got to be out looking for new work. But it's no good having new works if you can't sell them. Fundraising, working with the rest of the institution to present the image of the company, that's all part of the job.\" He admits it's \"scary\" but he sounds buoyant. \"It's a great honour to be chosen to run a company with this kind of heritage and this kind of status. I'm very excited.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>After months of anticipation and hype, the internet shopping business Lastminute.com finally joined the stock market yesterday and immediately crystallised a \u00a3150m paper fortune for its founders, Brent Hoberman, 31, and Martha Lane Fox, 27. </p> <p>Mr Hoberman and Ms Lane Fox, who have become pin-ups for the new breed of net entrepreneurs, were in their Mayfair offices early yesterday to watch the newly floated shares soar from a sale price of 380p to 555p in minutes, valuing the 19-month-old company at \u00a3835m at one stage. At the end of the day, after a frenzy of trading on the stock market, the price settled at 477p. </p> <p>\"I'm not quite myself today,\" said Ms Lane Fox, trying to compose herself for one of several TV interviews first thing in the morning. Under strict instructions from her American investment bankers at Morgan Stanley not to make any leading comments on the share price or value of Lastminute.com, she restricted herself to explaining how the \u00a3113m raised from the flotation will be used to finance the expansion of the Lastminute sales concept across Europe and then around the world. </p> <p>But the 200,000 investors who rushed to buy shares in the flotation - registering their details in advance at the company's website - suffered severe disappointment. Shares for the public were distributed evenly among applicants, leading to allocations of 35 shares for each investor, which were worth \u00a3167 last night. After paying dealing charges and tax, any new-issue speculator selling the shares will be lucky to make a profit. </p> <p>Lastminute started off by selling cheap flights online, but branched out to offer everything from flowers and chocolates to theatre tickets. Mr Hoberman and Ms Lane Fox believe there is a huge market potential in selling to \"asset rich/time poor\" customers who are too busy to organise their shopping and who tend to be natural last-minute purchasers. </p> <p>Aside from luring regular internet shoppers, Lastminute.com also expects to see a spectacular increase in purchases made over mobile phones - travellers, for example, might book a flight that way, then also choose a restaurant at their destination through their mobile internet connection. </p> <p>Lastminute is also developing services through digital TV, after signing deals with cable companies NTL and Cable &amp; Wireless Communications. </p> <p>Mr Hoberman, said his immediate task now was \"to keep moving fast, to execute the business plan\". </p> <p>Many commentators, though, have questioned the valuation attached to a business that will not make a profit for the foreseeable future and which has transacted deals, such as flight purchases, worth only \u00a34.3m during the last three months of 1999. </p> <p>But Julie Meyer, one of the founders of First Tuesday, a networking club for budding cyberspace entrepreneurs, said she was confident about Lastminute. She pointed out that it commanded a scarcity value among investors. </p> <p>\"They were pioneers, out there early, and they have built a great brand name. It is now virtually impossible for someone to replicate it. As for value, it is like beauty - all in the eye of the beholder,\" she said, adding that Mr Hoberman and Ms Lane Fox have been instrumental in widening the popularity of the net in Britain. \"These guys have changed the face of e-commerce in the UK. Great brand names do not disappear overnight.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "After months of anticipation and hype, the internet shopping business Lastminute.com finally joined the stock market yesterday and immediately crystallised a \u00a3150m paper fortune for its founders, Brent Hoberman, 31, and Martha Lane Fox, 27. Mr Hoberman and Ms Lane Fox, who have become pin-ups for the new breed of net entrepreneurs, were in their Mayfair offices early yesterday to watch the newly floated shares soar from a sale price of 380p to 555p in minutes, valuing the 19-month-old company at \u00a3835m at one stage. At the end of the day, after a frenzy of trading on the stock market, the price settled at 477p. \"I'm not quite myself today,\" said Ms Lane Fox, trying to compose herself for one of several TV interviews first thing in the morning. Under strict instructions from her American investment bankers at Morgan Stanley not to make any leading comments on the share price or value of Lastminute.com, she restricted herself to explaining how the \u00a3113m raised from the flotation will be used to finance the expansion of the Lastminute sales concept across Europe and then around the world. But the 200,000 investors who rushed to buy shares in the flotation - registering their details in advance at the company's website - suffered severe disappointment. Shares for the public were distributed evenly among applicants, leading to allocations of 35 shares for each investor, which were worth \u00a3167 last night. After paying dealing charges and tax, any new-issue speculator selling the shares will be lucky to make a profit. Lastminute started off by selling cheap flights online, but branched out to offer everything from flowers and chocolates to theatre tickets. Mr Hoberman and Ms Lane Fox believe there is a huge market potential in selling to \"asset rich/time poor\" customers who are too busy to organise their shopping and who tend to be natural last-minute purchasers. Aside from luring regular internet shoppers, Lastminute.com also expects to see a spectacular increase in purchases made over mobile phones - travellers, for example, might book a flight that way, then also choose a restaurant at their destination through their mobile internet connection. Lastminute is also developing services through digital TV, after signing deals with cable companies NTL and Cable &amp; Wireless Communications. Mr Hoberman, said his immediate task now was \"to keep moving fast, to execute the business plan\". Many commentators, though, have questioned the valuation attached to a business that will not make a profit for the foreseeable future and which has transacted deals, such as flight purchases, worth only \u00a34.3m during the last three months of 1999. But Julie Meyer, one of the founders of First Tuesday, a networking club for budding cyberspace entrepreneurs, said she was confident about Lastminute. She pointed out that it commanded a scarcity value among investors. \"They were pioneers, out there early, and they have built a great brand name. It is now virtually impossible for someone to replicate it. As for value, it is like beauty - all in the eye of the beholder,\" she said, adding that Mr Hoberman and Ms Lane Fox have been instrumental in widening the popularity of the net in Britain. \"These guys have changed the face of e-commerce in the UK. Great brand names do not disappear overnight.\"",

      "body": "<p>David Blunkett, the education secretary, will tomorrow seek to head off a Cabinet revolt over his handling of the repeal of Section 28 by publishing statutory guidance referring to the importance of stable relationships as well as marriage. </p> <p>He will also publish guidance on sex education in schools giving teachers freedom to address teenage pregnancy and sex outside marriage. </p> <p>Ministers had feared that Mr Blunkett was so intent on winning the bishops' support for repeal of Section 28 that he was willing to pass laws projecting marriage as not merely the best but the sole context for raising children. He has been in negotiations with both Anglican and Catholic bishops for nearly a month discussing the wording of the amendments to this part of the local government act. </p> <p>Section 28, which was passed by the Conservatives, bans councils from promoting homosexuality in schools, but has become a lightning rod for a wider debate about equal treatment for homosexuals. </p> <p>A Downing Street source said the bishops had been driving a very hard bargain, partly under pressure from their congregations. Mr Blunkett needs the churches' support if he is to overcome resistance, from mainly Conservative peers, to the repeal. </p> <p>By a massive majority, the Lords rejected repeal during the passage of the local government bill, though ministers had insisted that councils no longer had a role in sex education in schools. </p> <p>To try to defuse the row, Mr Blunkett will tomorrow table an amendment to the learning and skills bill, now before the Lords, setting out marriage as the foundation of society. However, the amendment will also refer to the importance of stable relationships in raising children. Liberal minded ministers will be able to interpret these words as supportive of gay partners and parents who raise children outside marriage. It will be one of the first times that ministers have set out their views on marriage in a statutory form. </p> <p>Tomorrow, Mr Blunkett will also publish a draft consultation document on the teaching of sex education in schools. Ministerial sources said it would place a heavy emphasis on the need to educate children about how to avoid teenage pregnancy. </p> <p>The document will closely follow the advice set out in the recent social exclusion unit report on teenage pregnancy, which called for sex education to be comprehensive and include advice about the need to use contraceptives. </p> <p>Government guidelines on sex education have not been revised since 1994, and Britain has the highest level of teenage pregnancy in Europe. </p> <p>The department of health and Baroness Jay, the minister for women, have warned against tabling any statutory amendment that restricts the freedom of teachers to talk to pupils about teenage sex. The guidelines will also reject stereotyping, and advocate respect for those who appear to be different. </p> <p>If the bishops support the compromise, as expected, Labour will use its majority to reinstate the repeal of Section 28. Labour ministers hope Conservative resistance in the Lords will crumble if the bishops stand back. </p> <p>Stonewall, the gay pressure group, said it would set greatest store by the draft guidelines, rather than the amendment to the leaning and skills bill, since the guidelines would be the document with which teachers would work.</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Blunkett, the education secretary, will tomorrow seek to head off a Cabinet revolt over his handling of the repeal of Section 28 by publishing statutory guidance referring to the importance of stable relationships as well as marriage. He will also publish guidance on sex education in schools giving teachers freedom to address teenage pregnancy and sex outside marriage. Ministers had feared that Mr Blunkett was so intent on winning the bishops' support for repeal of Section 28 that he was willing to pass laws projecting marriage as not merely the best but the sole context for raising children. He has been in negotiations with both Anglican and Catholic bishops for nearly a month discussing the wording of the amendments to this part of the local government act. Section 28, which was passed by the Conservatives, bans councils from promoting homosexuality in schools, but has become a lightning rod for a wider debate about equal treatment for homosexuals. A Downing Street source said the bishops had been driving a very hard bargain, partly under pressure from their congregations. Mr Blunkett needs the churches' support if he is to overcome resistance, from mainly Conservative peers, to the repeal. By a massive majority, the Lords rejected repeal during the passage of the local government bill, though ministers had insisted that councils no longer had a role in sex education in schools. To try to defuse the row, Mr Blunkett will tomorrow table an amendment to the learning and skills bill, now before the Lords, setting out marriage as the foundation of society. However, the amendment will also refer to the importance of stable relationships in raising children. Liberal minded ministers will be able to interpret these words as supportive of gay partners and parents who raise children outside marriage. It will be one of the first times that ministers have set out their views on marriage in a statutory form. Tomorrow, Mr Blunkett will also publish a draft consultation document on the teaching of sex education in schools. Ministerial sources said it would place a heavy emphasis on the need to educate children about how to avoid teenage pregnancy. The document will closely follow the advice set out in the recent social exclusion unit report on teenage pregnancy, which called for sex education to be comprehensive and include advice about the need to use contraceptives. Government guidelines on sex education have not been revised since 1994, and Britain has the highest level of teenage pregnancy in Europe. The department of health and Baroness Jay, the minister for women, have warned against tabling any statutory amendment that restricts the freedom of teachers to talk to pupils about teenage sex. The guidelines will also reject stereotyping, and advocate respect for those who appear to be different. If the bishops support the compromise, as expected, Labour will use its majority to reinstate the repeal of Section 28. Labour ministers hope Conservative resistance in the Lords will crumble if the bishops stand back. Stonewall, the gay pressure group, said it would set greatest store by the draft guidelines, rather than the amendment to the leaning and skills bill, since the guidelines would be the document with which teachers would work.",

Paying more tax, the Conservative leader said, weakened citizens' rights to decide how to spend their income. He likened Gordon Brown, the chancellor, to a \"giant squid\" whose tentacles were slowly smothering economic freedoms. Downing Street hit back, challenging Mr Hague to explain how he would fund tax cuts by reducing welfare benefits, and said taxation under the Tories would have been higher in a year's time. The Conservatives are hoping their tax guarantee - to lower tax regardless of economic circumstances - will be a vote winner. In a keynote speech to the Politeia think tank, in which Mr Hague outlined his aim of making tax a key election battleground, he warned high taxation took away the need for individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, and made citizens \"cynical\" about the ability of the Government to deliver. \"High taxes mean less freedom, less responsibility, less community, more dependency, a less elevated human condition,\" he said. Mr Hague said Tony Blair and Mr Brown wanted to make government bigger and redistribute increasing amounts of income. \"Like some giant squid in a monster movie, the chancellor wants to gradually extend the tentacles of the treasury and suffocate our freedom without anyone even noticing.\" Tax on tobacco and drink had been raised to the point where millions of law-abiding people were ready to break the law to evade the duty, he said. \"However unacceptable and illegal tax evasion is, the fact is that high taxes lead to a growth in the sly arts of dodging and weaving.

The news organisation and two reporters, ITV's Penny Marshall and Channel 4's Ian Williams, sued LM magazine over an article headlined \"The picture that fooled the world\", which questioned the credibility of their 1992 report on two Serb-run camps in Bosnia. The two were each awarded \u00a3150,000 by the jury - the maximum suggested by the judge, Mr Justice Morland - while Independent Television News received \u00a375,000. LM magazine - formerly Living Marxism, and with a circulation of 10,000 - also faces a bill for costs estimated at more than \u00a3300,000. This means the magazine, its editor and its publisher - who had raised only \u00a370,000 in donations towards their \u00a3100,000 costs - are now bankrupt. The TV reporters had called \"outrageous\" an allegation that they deliberately misrep resented the image of an emaciated Bosnian Muslim, Fikret Alic, as being caged behind barbed wire at Trnopolje camp by selective use of \"camera angles and editing\". The footage, which was likened to that of the Nazi concentration camps, prompted an international outcry and was credited with hastening western military involvement. The unanimous verdict by the jury of 10 men and two women brings to an end a three-year libel battle that had threatened far-reaching implications for television news coverage of war. The trial also raised questions about the \"journalism of attachment\" by war reporters, while ITN's decision to sue LM prompted debate about the strict libel laws and whether media organisations should use them against each other. At the end of the two-week trial, the jury found that a February 1997 article by Thomas Deichmann, a German journalist, was wrong to claim that the image of Mr Alic was deliberately misrepresented by the reporters. LM's editor, Mick Hume, and its publishers, Informinc (LM) Ltd and Helene Guldberg, had pleaded justification and fair comment. The article claimed the barbed wire was not around the camp - which Mr Deichmann said was a refugee collection centre not a prison - but around the news team, filming from a small enclosure next to the camp. The two ITN journalists - whose news teams were accompanied to the camps by the Guardian journalist Ed Vulliamy - claimed the article and an accompanying press release and editorial amounted to a highly damaging attack on their reputations and professional integrity. As the jury returned its unanimous verdict after four hours, a tearful Ms Marshall was comforted by Mr Williams. ITN issued a statement promising to pay any of their \u00a375,000 damages recovered to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Mr Williams said outside the court: \"It's tremendous to be vindicated. What we have seen is a sordid attempt to rewrite history.

But the freedom to print lies masquerading as the truth, as LM did, is not.\" Richard Tait, ITN's editor-in-chief, said the verdict \"wholly vindicates our decision to take action against LM over the lies they told.\" Both Mr Hume and Mr Deichmann refused to apologise for the article and stood by it. Mr Hume, who denied allegations in court that he had taken a pro-Serb line during the Bosnian conflict, said: \"The only thing this court case has proved beyond reasonable doubt is that English libel law is a disgrace to democracy and a menace to free press.\"",

      "body": "<p>The glossy monthly magazine at the centre of the ITN libel trial describes itself as \"the big-mouthed, broad-minded magazine produced in the UK that shouts what others don't dare to whisper\".</p> <p>LM is \"an agenda-setting publication that goes against the grain\", the website says.</p> <p>It is also a \"shoestring operation\" on the fringes of British journalism with a readership of only 10,000, the editor, Mick Hume, 40, admitted.</p> <p>The magazine was born from the ashes of Living Marxism, the mouthpiece of the Revolutionary Communist party edited by Hume since its 1988 launch. Helene Guldberg and Claire Fox formed a company, Informinc, and bought the title in 1992, changing it to LM and arguing that \"if Gentlemen's Quarterly had become GQ then LM could be a new current affairs magazine, post-politics\".</p> <p>Hume, an austere one-time communist, remained editor, and the magazine became, to all intents and purposes, a one man band. He admitted using a pen name in LM, because it was embarrassing to have so many articles by the same person in a single edition.</p> <p>His critics claim that the magazine has a policy of \"being against everything but for nothing\", without any coherent ideology or political philosophy, and wilfully perverse on the issues it debates.</p> <p>It supports scientific testing on animals and a \"human-centred morality\" while opposing the Gulf war, western involvement in the Bosnian conflict, environmentalism, \"the counselling culture\" and population control.

      "bodyText": "The glossy monthly magazine at the centre of the ITN libel trial describes itself as \"the big-mouthed, broad-minded magazine produced in the UK that shouts what others don't dare to whisper\". LM is \"an agenda-setting publication that goes against the grain\", the website says. It is also a \"shoestring operation\" on the fringes of British journalism with a readership of only 10,000, the editor, Mick Hume, 40, admitted. The magazine was born from the ashes of Living Marxism, the mouthpiece of the Revolutionary Communist party edited by Hume since its 1988 launch. Helene Guldberg and Claire Fox formed a company, Informinc, and bought the title in 1992, changing it to LM and arguing that \"if Gentlemen's Quarterly had become GQ then LM could be a new current affairs magazine, post-politics\". Hume, an austere one-time communist, remained editor, and the magazine became, to all intents and purposes, a one man band. He admitted using a pen name in LM, because it was embarrassing to have so many articles by the same person in a single edition. His critics claim that the magazine has a policy of \"being against everything but for nothing\", without any coherent ideology or political philosophy, and wilfully perverse on the issues it debates. It supports scientific testing on animals and a \"human-centred morality\" while opposing the Gulf war, western involvement in the Bosnian conflict, environmentalism, \"the counselling culture\" and population control. It takes an unashamedly libertarian ap proach to personal relationships and privacy. Nevertheless, it attracted a young, affluent, well-educated readership drawn largely from the media world, and persuaded big names from across the political spectrum to speak at its various events, conferences and seminars. The aim of LM, the owners said, was to create a magazine that could reflect the new shift in politics, where left and right were no longer relevant labels. It would be a publication brave enough to \"put its head above the parapet\" and \"ask questions rather than collapsing into bland consensus\", treating adults as grown-ups and seeking to ban nothing while questioning everything. The magazine, which rarely has advertisements and does not pay its contributors, says it has no big backers from any political party or group, relying instead on small donations from dedicated readers. As Claire Fox said earlier this year: \"The whole premise of LM was that contributors would write for free under the banner of free speech. \"We think we publish a cutting edge, cultural, current affairs magazine on a shoestring budget that has made an impact on a range of debates. But in the eyes of LM's opponents, the magazine has been branded Stalinist Serbomaniac, a Monsanto-backed attack on environmentalism and a diabolical rightwing propaganda rag that hates animals and apologises for genocide.\" Hume and his colleagues have made their way into mainstream media, regularly heard on Nicky Campbell's Radio 5 Live show, while Hume has a column in the Times. According to Ian Hargreaves, journalism professor at Cardiff university: \"LM has become a phenomenon, admired by the political right as well as the left.\" Or, as a leftwing journalist put it, \"a bizarre personality cult around a non-personality\".",

Outside the court the debate raged over the rights and wrongs of a mighty media organisation using its vast resources to silence criticism and \"destroy\" - in Hume's words - a tiny independent magazine.

      "body": "<p>Five pigs born 10 days ago in Blacksburg, Virginia - but only announced yesterday by a British firm based at Roslin in Scotland - are clones that could lead to new ways to save life. </p> <p>Millie, Christa, Alexis, Carrel and Dotcom are living proof of the first step towards supplies of identical pig organs genetically engineered to be compatible with the human bodies that might need them. </p> <p>In a world where patients in urgent need of spare part surgery outnumber potential donors by 20 to 1, the five piglets and their successors are claimed to be \"the only near-term solution to solving the worldwide organ shortage crisis.\" </p> <p>The market in \"xenotransplanted\" organs - transplanted from another species - could be worth $6bn, and clinical trials with pig organs could start in four years, providing governments give the go-ahead. </p> <p>The five pigs are proof that pigs can be cloned: they will enjoy a life of comfort and celebrity. Although born in the US, they were brainchildren of PPL Therapeutics, the commercial business built on the site of the Roslin institute, progenitors of Dolly the sheep. </p> <p>Millie was the name long ago selected for the world's first pig clone. Christa honours Christian Barnard, who performed the first human heart transplant in 1967. Two others salute Alexis Carrel, a 1912 Nobel prizewinner who pioneered transplantation. Dotcom was so called for luck. \"Any association with dotcoms right now seems to have a very positive influence on a company's valuation,\" said Ron James, PPL's chief executive. </p> <p>The piglets are pioneers in what is now called \"pharming\" - the employment of animals in the human health business. PPL already has a flock of sheep producing alpha 1-antitrypsin, a human protein for cystic fibrosis sufferers, a flock producing a protein that seals wounds and stops bleeding and another making a human enzyme that breaks down fats - urgently needed by people with pancreatic damage. It is also produced in mother's milk - and could help premature babies that cannot be breast fed. None of these products is yet in use. None of their makers is a clone, but all of them have added genes. </p> <p>\"What cloning allows us to do for the first time is switch off genes as well,\" said Ron James. The next step is to switch off a pig gene called alpha 1-3 gal transferase. This sugar group on the pig tissue signals to the human immune system that the transplanted organ was foreign: there would be a massive response, the organ would be destroyed and the patient would die. There would still be risk of rejection so the next step would be to put an extra gene in the pig - switched on at the moment of surgery - to prevent clotting in the patient's blood cells, which would starve the organ of oxygen. \"We are claiming that we have the most comprehensive solution we know of,\" said Dr James. </p> <p>PPL is not the only group hoping to use genetically engineered, human-compatible pigs for transplants of hearts, lungs, liver and other organs. For the time being, the technique has been blocked while government-appointed experts consider whether animal viruses concealed in pig DNA could somehow get into the human population. </p> <p>But the ability to clone pigs gives the Scottish-based group a new edge: cloning guarantees that the same genes will work in the same way in all progeny. The transfer of DNA from a parent-twin to the eggs that led to Millie, Christa, Alexis, Carrel and Dotcom followed the nuclear transfer process that led to Dolly the sheep, but involved new steps that will lead to new patent applications. The cells taken from the parent were sent to an independent labora tory for testing before the piglets were born. </p> <p>\"That is so we couldn't be accused of taking the cells from the pigs themselves. That means we are absolutely certain they were clones. That's the reason why - though they were born nine days ago - we've only gone public today.

      "bodyText": "Five pigs born 10 days ago in Blacksburg, Virginia - but only announced yesterday by a British firm based at Roslin in Scotland - are clones that could lead to new ways to save life. Millie, Christa, Alexis, Carrel and Dotcom are living proof of the first step towards supplies of identical pig organs genetically engineered to be compatible with the human bodies that might need them. In a world where patients in urgent need of spare part surgery outnumber potential donors by 20 to 1, the five piglets and their successors are claimed to be \"the only near-term solution to solving the worldwide organ shortage crisis.\" The market in \"xenotransplanted\" organs - transplanted from another species - could be worth $6bn, and clinical trials with pig organs could start in four years, providing governments give the go-ahead. The five pigs are proof that pigs can be cloned: they will enjoy a life of comfort and celebrity. Although born in the US, they were brainchildren of PPL Therapeutics, the commercial business built on the site of the Roslin institute, progenitors of Dolly the sheep. Millie was the name long ago selected for the world's first pig clone. Christa honours Christian Barnard, who performed the first human heart transplant in 1967. Two others salute Alexis Carrel, a 1912 Nobel prizewinner who pioneered transplantation. Dotcom was so called for luck. \"Any association with dotcoms right now seems to have a very positive influence on a company's valuation,\" said Ron James, PPL's chief executive. The piglets are pioneers in what is now called \"pharming\" - the employment of animals in the human health business. PPL already has a flock of sheep producing alpha 1-antitrypsin, a human protein for cystic fibrosis sufferers, a flock producing a protein that seals wounds and stops bleeding and another making a human enzyme that breaks down fats - urgently needed by people with pancreatic damage. It is also produced in mother's milk - and could help premature babies that cannot be breast fed. None of these products is yet in use. None of their makers is a clone, but all of them have added genes. \"What cloning allows us to do for the first time is switch off genes as well,\" said Ron James. The next step is to switch off a pig gene called alpha 1-3 gal transferase. This sugar group on the pig tissue signals to the human immune system that the transplanted organ was foreign: there would be a massive response, the organ would be destroyed and the patient would die. There would still be risk of rejection so the next step would be to put an extra gene in the pig - switched on at the moment of surgery - to prevent clotting in the patient's blood cells, which would starve the organ of oxygen. \"We are claiming that we have the most comprehensive solution we know of,\" said Dr James. PPL is not the only group hoping to use genetically engineered, human-compatible pigs for transplants of hearts, lungs, liver and other organs. For the time being, the technique has been blocked while government-appointed experts consider whether animal viruses concealed in pig DNA could somehow get into the human population. But the ability to clone pigs gives the Scottish-based group a new edge: cloning guarantees that the same genes will work in the same way in all progeny. The transfer of DNA from a parent-twin to the eggs that led to Millie, Christa, Alexis, Carrel and Dotcom followed the nuclear transfer process that led to Dolly the sheep, but involved new steps that will lead to new patent applications. The cells taken from the parent were sent to an independent labora tory for testing before the piglets were born. \"That is so we couldn't be accused of taking the cells from the pigs themselves. That means we are absolutely certain they were clones. That's the reason why - though they were born nine days ago - we've only gone public today. It took that long to check,\" said Dr James yesterday. \"They are absolutely fine and growing rapidly, as piglets do, and their surrogate mother is also fine and feeding them happily.\" Dolly was the only successful clone in 227 attempts. The PPL scientists had been working on ways to clone pigs for almost a year, making perhaps an experiment a week. This was the first to work. It did not bring human cloning any closer, he said. \"The Dolly technology has now been available to scientists for more than two years. To our knowledge, nobody has tried to make a human: it is just something the media keeps talking about. We are no nearer to doing that. We should take comfort from the fact that nobody has even tried,\" he said.",

Mr Kennedy is determined to put a green agenda at the heart of the Lib Dem manifesto for the next election, and will make it the centrepiece of his speech to activists at the party's spring conference in Plymouth at the weekend. He will seek to portray environmental pollution as an issue of freedom, arguing that people living in poverty in inner cities find their lives restricted by pollution-linked illnesses. He hopes his stance will embarrass Tony Blair, who, Lib Dems claim, has not made a speech solely on the subject of the environment since becoming prime minister. One source close to Mr Kennedy last night claimed he had never forgotten how, after the 1989 Euro elections in which the Lib Dems slumped at the polls and the Greens gained 15%, Labour MP Mo Mowlam (now cabinet office coordinator) said to him: \"You might as well join us [the Labour party] now\". \"Charles remains convinced that those 15% of green votes are there to be won,\" the source said. However, the Lib Dems will have to confront the reality that apparent public goodwill over green issues does little to modify opposition to congestion charging and workplace car parking charging, both also certain to be on the party's green-hued manifesto. Mr Kennedy will also use the conference to stress Lib Dem intentions to reverse any income tax cuts introduced by the Labour government, including the 1p cut in the base rate due to come in next month. He will seek to portray his party as the true protector of public services.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury's has protested to the home office that it did not want to \"profit at the expense of asylum seekers\" when it discovered that, as an incentive to taking part in a voucher scheme, it could keep any change due. The supermarket chain writes in a letter to the Guardian today that the home office told it Jack Straw's new immigration and asylum act made it illegal to give change to asylum seekers who used their shops. Sodexho Pass, the company running the scheme, has told potential \"trading partners\" that vouchers given to asylum seekers cannot be exchanged for cash: \"If the goods to the value of \u00a34.50 are purchased with a \u00a35 voucher the 50p change should not be handed back, but you as a trading partner will receive the full \u00a35 value for that voucher.\" Sainsbury's writes that it finally decided to take part \"because the alternative is for civil servants to hand out bags of shopping to asylum seekers; taking away their right to choose what they want to buy.\" Last night the refugee charity Asylum Aid said there was nothing in the primary legislation to prevent supermar kets giving change, and appealed to all shops to offer change \"as a matter of fairness and principle\". A home office spokeswoman confirmed that the new law did not make it illegal to give change. \"That was a policy decision made by the home office,\" she said. The voucher system comes into effect for 30,000 asylum seekers from April. A single adult is expected to live on \u00a336.54 a week worth of vouchers, including a \u00a310 weekly cash voucher, to cover daily essential needs while the asylum claim is determined. The average waiting time is 13 months. Yvonne West, Sainsbury's voucher manager, writes that the chain raised the matter with the home office \"because we do not want to keep the change and profit at the expense of asylum seekers\". She says the home office argued the mix of cash and vouchers meant the exact amount could be proffered at the check-out. \"They do not have to buy everything at once, or spend all of their allowance in one shop,\" she explained. Zoe Harper of Asylum Aid said: \"Newly arrived asylum seekers unfamiliar with the currency will have great difficulty in juggling the vouchers with the small cash allowance, as Sainsbury's suggests.\"",

Congress is currently debating Taiwan's request to buy advanced weapons systems (which Beijing fiercely opposes), and China's application to join the World Trade Organisation. Beijing's bellicosity has increased the chances that it will achieve, in its own eyes, the wrong outcome on both issues.

While airline executives plan for a 5% annual increase in air travel, the intergovernmental panel on climate change predicts that airliners will be responsible for 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. While IPCC scientists tell us that a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is needed to stabilise global temperatures, the Kyoto treaty is proposing just 5.2%, and even this is being vigorously opposed by big business. David Edwards Bournemouth david@awed.fsnet.co.uk \u0095 While Peter Hetherington's analysis of the government's ambivalence on the English regional agenda (Nudge and fudge, March 13) is compelling, his statistics are not. Try plotting the Regional Development Agency's budgets per capita, either of population or of claimants. The south-east faces its own challenges, not least how to sustain its contribution to the UK's competitiveness.

Somehow, the party has to remedy that by the time we next vote, perhaps in little more than a year. William Hague's speech on taxation yesterday marks an essential stage in that process, staking out the territory on which he plans to fight, after a long and desultory period in which it sometimes seemed that his only distinctive message would be bile about Europe. Taxation is destined to be the issue which in Conservative eyes tops them all: \"If we do not stand for lower taxes and smaller government, we do not stand for anything.\"</p> <p>The Tories will argue not just, as ever, that low taxation is essential to economic success and national regeneration, but more ambitiously, that people are somehow morally cleaner for having their taxes cut. \"Low tax,\" Mr Hague declared, \"gives people the means to look after themselves and acquire responsible habits. High tax drives out good conscience, drives out generous instincts, drives out the sense of personal responsibility, inculcates cynicism about the institutions that give our lives moral shape. If that is not a moral argument, I do not know what is.\" The calculation is plain. Even now, when its popularity ratings are dipping on many policy issues, New Labour seems to have got the message across that this is not the old Labour of promiscuous tax and spend. The Conservatives have been hammering away at the theme that while preaching prudence, the chancellor has been ratcheting up our taxes by stealth - a charge more or less admitted by Downing Street yesterday - but so far without denting Labour. Mr Hague has to find some way of repackaging the old Tory appeal to the voters' anti-tax instincts; and this at a time when opinion polls consistently re port that voters would willingly see taxes increased if it meant better public services, especially in health and education.</p> <p>The Conservatives hope to meet that challenge in two ways. First, by claiming, as Michael Portillo did yesterday on the basis of an arithmetic so far denied to us, that even while promoting the moral health of the nation by cutting our taxes, they will push up public spending on the services we most cherish. And second, by trying to banish the sense of guilt about having our taxes cut when so many people in the midst of our national affluence are poor and needy, and so many essential institutions starved of sustenance. Wanting lower taxes, Mr Hague asserts, is not self-indulgence, but a blow struck for honour and decency.</p> <p>Some of the case he makes is decidedly hazardous; some is downright shoddy. \"Taxes,\" he says, \"lie at the heart of state interference in our lives.\" But state provision, even under a William Hague government, is the one available opportunity for most people in Britain. If state interference means getting treatment for cancer or heart disease before it is too late to save them, then most people would favour more state interference, not less. Higher taxes mean not \"less freedom\", as Mr Hague claims, but a necessary ingredient of freedom from want, from disease and from fear. To assert, as he does, that high taxes \"destroy generous instincts\" would seem, after the recent response to the floods in Mozambique, a slander on the people Mr Hague hopes to govern. Still, to have the Conservatives making the moral case for lower taxation should put some real meat into next year's debate. The big question now is whether New Labour will be ready to answer it by making the moral case for higher taxation, from which it has flinched up to now.</p>",

It was April 23 1999, in block 39 of a complex of gloomy apartment blocks on a windy hill in the suburbs of Belgrade. She had fallen asleep with the television on; usually the Nato bombers kept her awake.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked at the television on top of the glass cabinet where she kept her leather-bound encyclopedias. The TV picture was gone and, at that moment, she knew that the last of her five children was dead.</p> <p>Zanha Stojanovic, a 63-year-old retired primary school teacher, died inside that night, when four tonnes of explosives flew through the glass-plated lobby of Belgrade's Radio Television Serbia (RTS) and killed her 26-year-old son, Nebojsa, her last surviving child.</p> <p>Nato killed 15 others that night, most of them technicians in their early 20s.</p> <p>\"None of us know exactly what we buried. I got a small envelope with a part of his gold chain and his car keys,\" Mrs Stojanovic says. Nebojsa's workmate Ksenija was identified by her sock, Darko by a shoe and Bane after a DNA test on a toe.</p> <p>A month before the bombing, General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme military commander, had sent two planes to bomb RTS. The pictures of Nato's bungled attacks and civilian casualties aired via the Serb state television station were the biggest threat to the west's united war effort.</p> <p>But that night in March, according to the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Patrick Sloyan, the attack was called off when someone at Nato headquarters leaked the attack to the president of CNN, Tom Johnston, who allegedly screamed down the phone to Nato HQ begging them to call it off. The French president, Jacques Chirac, vetoed the bombing and the two Nato planes that were already two hours out of Aviano airport in Italy were ordered to abandon their mission.</p> <p>A month later, on the night of April 22, when Mrs Stojanovic was dozing on the sofa, there were no presidents of TV stations or countries trying to save the life of her last child.</p> <p>Mrs Stojanovic was 22 when her first son, Branislav, died of a viral infection at seven months. When she was in her early 30s, she watched her 10-year-old daughter, Radmila, die from bone cancer. It took six months. Her twin boys, born prematurely, lived for two days in 1972.</p> <p>It's almost a year since the bombing of RTS and the death of Nebojsa. Mrs Stojanovic is still dressed in black, with a cameo of her son on her lapel. \"We will always want to know whose direct order it was. Was it Mr Clinton, was it Mr Blair or was it General Clark? And who gave them the right to kill those kids?

      "bodyText": "Mrs Stojanovic woke suddenly at 2.20am on the faded, chocolate-brown sofa of her two-room flat in Belgrade. It was April 23 1999, in block 39 of a complex of gloomy apartment blocks on a windy hill in the suburbs of Belgrade. She had fallen asleep with the television on; usually the Nato bombers kept her awake. She opened her eyes and looked at the television on top of the glass cabinet where she kept her leather-bound encyclopedias. The TV picture was gone and, at that moment, she knew that the last of her five children was dead. Zanha Stojanovic, a 63-year-old retired primary school teacher, died inside that night, when four tonnes of explosives flew through the glass-plated lobby of Belgrade's Radio Television Serbia (RTS) and killed her 26-year-old son, Nebojsa, her last surviving child. Nato killed 15 others that night, most of them technicians in their early 20s. \"None of us know exactly what we buried. I got a small envelope with a part of his gold chain and his car keys,\" Mrs Stojanovic says. Nebojsa's workmate Ksenija was identified by her sock, Darko by a shoe and Bane after a DNA test on a toe. A month before the bombing, General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme military commander, had sent two planes to bomb RTS. The pictures of Nato's bungled attacks and civilian casualties aired via the Serb state television station were the biggest threat to the west's united war effort. But that night in March, according to the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Patrick Sloyan, the attack was called off when someone at Nato headquarters leaked the attack to the president of CNN, Tom Johnston, who allegedly screamed down the phone to Nato HQ begging them to call it off. The French president, Jacques Chirac, vetoed the bombing and the two Nato planes that were already two hours out of Aviano airport in Italy were ordered to abandon their mission. A month later, on the night of April 22, when Mrs Stojanovic was dozing on the sofa, there were no presidents of TV stations or countries trying to save the life of her last child. Mrs Stojanovic was 22 when her first son, Branislav, died of a viral infection at seven months. When she was in her early 30s, she watched her 10-year-old daughter, Radmila, die from bone cancer. It took six months. Her twin boys, born prematurely, lived for two days in 1972. It's almost a year since the bombing of RTS and the death of Nebojsa. Mrs Stojanovic is still dressed in black, with a cameo of her son on her lapel. \"We will always want to know whose direct order it was. Was it Mr Clinton, was it Mr Blair or was it General Clark? And who gave them the right to kill those kids? Who gave those people the right to decide how long a person should live?\" She has other questions - bitter ones. \"My pain would be less if the management of RTS had tried to relocate them. Instead, they put up a notice ordering them to stay in the building, even though the foreign journalists warned them. \"The station ordered them to serve their country. We believe they were sacrificed by our own government for the propaganda of Nato attacking the freedom of the press.\" Facing the future Nebojsa, a slim, gentle man with a love of skiing, used to frighten his mother sometimes saying he was going to emigrate to New Zealand. \"Most of his friends have left the country since this all began, trying to get away to a normal life - to Botswana, to England - and they never came back. \"Despite everything that has happened to me I have to keep fighting for the future for all the kids around us. Deep in my soul, I am a teacher. I love children, but I'm not afraid to speak out now. \"My belief is that the man [Slobodan Milosevic] is sick in a particular way. Looking from the point of view of ordinary Serbs, I don't know what kind of a curse he put on us.\" She and her son had lived together in block 39 since her husband's death in 1994. Nebojsa was a child of the war generation. Drafted to Bosnia in 1991, he returned to work as a technician at RTS. \"In that first month of the bombing we got used to it, but in the park there were no birds any more, no squirrels any more. We lived in that climate saying they are not going to bomb our house, we are safe. He [Nebojsa] said to me 'mother, look at my palm, I have a long life line. They will bomb the transmitters not RTS'.\" After the bombing, Mrs Stojanovic stayed in her apartment for four days. Then she took her dog, Jeana, and went to the RTS building. \"There were rumours of noises, voices being heard under the rubble, that someone was trying to call on a mobile phone. I took our dog because maybe she could help with something. She was his dog. \"The security people didn't want to let me into the building - one of them even pointed his gun at me.

Then my cousin came and said 'Nebojsa has been identified, come on let's go home, there is nothing else for you here'. On the window sill behind her in a pine frame is a picture of the grave where her five children and her husband lie. \"I live in a cemetery,\" she says. About 500 military personnel and a similar number of civilians were killed by Nato bombs. So far, the only people to have received an apology are the families of the three staff killed in the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. \u0095 Next: Richard Norton-Taylor on how the Kosovo bombing changed the face of modern warfare",

For Susan Douglas, the moment of reckoning came while she was reading her morning paper. \"There was this big picture on the front page of a wedding dress showing in the Milan collections. My daughter, who was then six, asked me: 'What did you wear when you got married, mum?' Here we go, I thought.

Miss Paull, 20, a single mother who had been working in the Balsall Heath area of Birmingham at the time of her death in 1993, was found three weeks later near Lutterworth, Leicestershire. She was semi-naked and lying in a water-filled ditch. A few days later the naked body of Miss Turner, 30, from Stafford, was found. The jury heard how Kyte, also from Stafford, had boasted to prisoners while on remand how he had killed the women and disposed of their bodies. Describing the murder of Miss Paull, he said she had laughed at his sexual prowess so he had choked her until she had stopped laughing. During the 11-day trial four serving prisoners, including a murderer, told the court how Kyte confessed to the murders while on remand for a rape. He is currently serving seven years for a knife-point attack on a woman in Bristol.

The all-party home affairs select committee said the powers proposed by the government should be used only where it was \"almost certain\" an individual would commit a serious offence. Although the committee endorsed the most controversial aspect of the plans - provision to detain people who have committed no previous offence - it conceded that it would \"prove exceptionally difficult\" to establish that sufficient risk existed to justify such action. The MPs also demanded that parliament should review the powers annually and that each detention should be reassessed by a judicial body at regular intervals. The government's plans were put forward in the wake of the conviction of psychopath Michael Stone for the murder in Kent of Lyn Russell and her daughter Megan, and the attempted murder of a second daughter, Josie. The Fallon inquiry into Ashworth special hospital on Merseyside had also recommended that patients with a psychopathic, or personality, disorder should be separated from those diagnosed as mentally ill. After visiting such a separate service in Holland, the home affairs committee has come out in favour of setting up between 25 and 50 units for people with a personality disorder deemed to be dangerous. The units would be distinct from the hospital and prison systems. The government has estimated that 2,500 people could be placed in the units, but the committee was warned that numbers were very likely to rise beyond that figure. Robin Corbett, the committee's Labour chairman, said it had to be right for the state to have power to detain people assessed as being dangerous, either after they had completed a prison term \"or in circumstances where they had not been convicted of an offence\".

Later this month a performance of Antony and Cleopatra at the Barbican, the RSC's London base, will be accompanied by the text projected in a way similar to surtitles in opera houses, but at the side of the stage rather than above it. Until now deaf people have had to rely on the induction loop system - which can also unfortunately pick up calls from local taxis - or on the skills of signers, who can only present a summary of the action. But a caption technique pioneered by an American court reporter with lightning fingers will enable them to keep one eye on Shakespeare's words as they are spoken. The text will be shown at the exact moment it is declaimed. If the actors fluff a line, the op erator will be able to make immediate alterations to the captions. The system is already in use on Broadway in New York, where it has been used for productions including The King and I and Amadeus. \"The words will be projected in two lines of text two inches high on a screen about the size of a guitar case,\" said Peter Cadley, the RSC's theatres manager in London. The move was welcomed yesterday by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. 70,000 people can follow British sign language but 8m others with hearing prob lems cannot. \"Research shows that one in four hard of hearing people would visit the theatre more often if captioned performances were available,\" said Marie Mangan for the RNID.

The vehicle was designed and built by the defence evaluation and research agency and Vickers. The top and the hull are made entirely of the composite, though part of its armour plating is made of steel.

      "bodyText": "Robbie Williams has long been feted by teenagers, but yesterday it emerged he is also the first choice of those at the other end of this mortal coil; his song Angels has been voted the tune most people would like played at their funeral. In an annual poll of the most requested songs at funerals Williams's hit was a clear winner, ahead of Frank Sinatra's My Way, which has occupied second place since 1996, and Wind Beneath My Wings by Bette Midler. Visitors to the Co-Operative Funeral Service website were asked to nominate the song they would most like at their funeral, and the results collated to produce their top 10 pearly greats. These included: My Heart Will Go On (Celine Dion), Who Wants to Live Forever (Queen), You'll Never Walk Alone (Gerry and the Pacemakers), Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (Monty Python), I Will Always Love You (Whitney Houston), Great Balls of Fire (Jerry Lee Lewis) and Imagine (John Lennon). Ben Jason, sales and marketing manager, said:\"These songs mean more to people now than the hymns of 50 years ago.\"",

The woman, who lives in the Lancashire town, had told police that her four-month-old, named locally as Emma Jane Dyson, had been snatched in her pram from outside a public toilet in the town centre at 9.30am. While the father as well as the mother were being interviewed, officers spent the morning organising what became a major search, until the empty pram was found by a member of the public who had responded to an appeal for help. After the fully clothed body of the baby had been pulled from the Leeds-Liverpool canal, close to where her father lives, the mother was taken into custody. Reporting the loss, she had told police she had come out from the toilet and found her child gone, together with its pram and a red shopping bag hanging from it. Throughout the morning, a police helicopter led the search, which included mounted officers, while loudhailers were used to appeal to local people to join the search. At lunchtime a member of the public found the empty pram by a bridge next to the canal on the outskirts of Burnley. Less than an hour later, divers had found the body A post-mortem was being carried out yesterday. Inspector David Lea, of Lancashire police, who led the search, said a woman in her late 20s or early 30s had been arrested after the body was recovered though she had not been charged with any offence.

      "bodyText": "A man who went on the rampage with a samurai sword after his address was mistakenly published in the Macpherson report into the racist killing of Stephen Lawrence was cleared of attempted murder yesterday. A jury accepted that Errol Kelly, 35, had a nervous breakdown when details were released in February last year along with the names of witnesses and informers involved in the police investigation. Within four months Kelly, a carpenter, turned from a \"pleasant natured, hardworking family man\" into a \"snarling and bulging eyed\" obsessive who ran amok with the sword last June. The jury found Kelly not guilty by reason of insanity of attempted murder, affray, possessing an offensive weapon and dangerous driving after hearing he had moved into a house in Eltham, south-east London, where a witness connected to the inquiry had lived. Even though Kelly had nothing to do with the Lawrence case, he and his family were rehoused in the middle of the night and told the error had put them in danger of revenge attacks. Jeremy Donne, prosecuting, said Kelly, a father of five, had been renovating the council home and was thinking of buying it when the address appeared in the appendix of Sir William's report. The list was supposed to have been confidential but was printed because of an administrative error, the Old Bailey was told. Mr Donne said the enforced move \"unsettled him so that he rapidly became unwell\". He became distrustful, developed a religious obsession and made visits to the Stephen Lawrence memorial, the court heard. Kelly's wife, Alison, realised he was ill and warned the police that he was \"going to blow\". She told the court: \"I desperately tried to get him help and came up against a brick wall every time.\" Her husband finally \"cracked\" at 3.30am on June 17. Mrs Kelly awoke to find him \"ranting\" in the middle of the road dressed in his pyjamas. Mr Donne said: \"She saw him holding a Samurai sword. As a police vehicle approached he jumped at it, wielding the sword.\" Kelly got in his own car, drove the wrong way down the street and hit another vehicle head on. When a woman in the car asked what was going on, he smashed the windscreen with his sword. Kelly attacked a police car in similar fashion and then turned towards PC Glenn Gore, a dog handler. \"His mouth was fixed in a snarl. Kelly ran at PC Gore's vehicle with the blade of the sword pointing directly in the face of the police officer,\" Mr Donne said. PC Gore drove at Kelly and, with the help of several other officers, managed to restrain him.

The jury was told the trial was a formality but that the law required members to bring a verdict of not guilty to the charges by reason of insanity.

Ian Gibson, MP for Norwich North, said he believed that the Cheshire laboratory could still win the project. \"I do not think it is all over because I believe that the French government may have something to say about it.\"</p> <p>He added that scientists overwhelmingly favoured Daresbury over the Oxfordshire laboratory.</p> <p>MPs on the committee yesterday wrote to the government expressing their unease at the decision.</p> <p>The French embassy's intervention will embarrass the prime minister and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers. In private meetings with Labour backbenchers from the north-west they indicated that they favoured the project being based in Cheshire but insisted that their hands were being forced by French and the Wellcome Trust.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The French government last night challenged Downing Street's account of the wrangling that led ministers to base a \u00a3500m science project in Oxfordshire rather than at a leading laboratory in the north-west. As Labour MPs stepped up their attacks on the government for abandoning the north, a diplomat at the French embassy in London dismissed Downing Street claims that Paris would have withdrawn its support if the project had been based in the north-west. Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's official spokesman, tried to fend off Labour critics on Monday by insisting that the government had been forced to base the synchrotron project in Oxfordshire because of pressure from the French government. Paris is financing the project, along with the Wellcome Trust and the British government. Pointing out that Paris and the Wellcome Trust were pushing for the south-east, Mr Campbell said: \"There was a risk of losing the project had we not gone along with this.\" Less than 24 hours later, the scientific counsellor at the French embassy in London, Michel Bernier, said his government had argued \"unofficially\" in favour of the Rutherford Appleton laboratory in Didcot because the \"critical mass\" of scientists in Britain were based in the south-east. But asked whether the French government would have minded whether the contract had been awarded to the Daresbury laboratory in Cheshire, Mr Bernier told Radio 4's The World at One: \"No, it would not have been an issue at all.\" His remarks were last night seized on by a Labour member of the Commons select committee on science and technology. Ian Gibson, MP for Norwich North, said he believed that the Cheshire laboratory could still win the project. \"I do not think it is all over because I believe that the French government may have something to say about it.\" He added that scientists overwhelmingly favoured Daresbury over the Oxfordshire laboratory. MPs on the committee yesterday wrote to the government expressing their unease at the decision. The French embassy's intervention will embarrass the prime minister and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers. In private meetings with Labour backbenchers from the north-west they indicated that they favoured the project being based in Cheshire but insisted that their hands were being forced by French and the Wellcome Trust.",

      "body": "<p>For years it has been one of the worst-kept secrets in British politics. At 11 o'clock every weekday morning when parliament is sitting, the Downing Street spokesman, Alastair Campbell, briefs lobby correspondents on the day's agenda and fields their questions.</p> <p>Since the 1997 general election these exchanges have been formally on the record, quotable and attributed to \"the official Downing Street spokesman\". But not until today have Mr Campbell's words been attributable to him by name - though it is a household name to millions of politically minded people.</p> <p>Faced with complaints this week that he is allowing Michael Cockerell, a BBC documentary-maker to film some of his daily briefings, Mr Campbell conceded that his declared desire for anonymity is getting harder to sustain.</p> <p>\"I don't think this adds up to a row of beans. I speak as the prime minister's spokesman. We are a parliamentary democracy and the government is accountable to parliament,\" he said.</p> <p>Some MPs worry that Mr Campbell himself is not accountable enough. He says he is simply the conveyor of Mr Blair's words and intentions - which are often misrepresented by cynical, sensational or malign media.</p> <p>Nowadays Mr Campbell briefs in the basement of 10 Downing Street where 20 to 30 correspondents sit in rows of stackable chairs.</p> <p>Sir Bernard Ingham's customers perched on the arm of sofa in the press secretary's room in Lady Thatcher's day. So did those briefed by John Major's gentler spokesmen, Gus O'Donnell, Chris Meyer, now ambassador to Washington, and Jonathan Haslem, a career civil servant.</p> <p>Every afternoon they would repeat the performance in a room at the top of a Gothic turret high above the Thames in the Palace of Westminster. The day's agenda would have moved on by then. Instead of evening paper reporters and the TV/radio crowd, the morning papers would be more vocal.</p> <p>But times change. Academics, then columnists and leader writers deplored the secrecy of it all. The refurbished No 10 basement was part of the shake-up when 42-year-old Mr Campbell, combative former political editor of the Daily Mirror, moved into No 10 with Tony Blair in May 1997. He put his briefings on the record but kept them anonymous, to help lower his personal profile, al ready high enough for many Labour MPs and ministers.</p> <p>Mr Campbell also got himself a hybrid contract - part civil servant, part political adviser - which allowed him to mix it with journalists on party politics in a way which his many predecessors had been constrained from doing.</p> <p>He thus treads a fine line and critics, who include the pugnacious Sir Bernard, say he frequently steps over it.</p> <p>They also say he has \"politicised\" the entire government information system through the pernicious use of \"spin\" - an aggressive pro-government gloss on the day's facts.</p> <p>Yesterday's exchanges at 4 o'clock were pretty routine as Mr Campbell set out Mr Blair's day. Spokesman and reporters toss around ideas, claims and counter-claims as they always do. Few will find their way into print as stories this morning. Readers can compare his words with the summary now published daily on the Downing Street website. Critics of his deft skills will find the ammunition they want, while government loyalists will wonder at Mr Campbell's patience. He often wonders himself.</p> <p><b>Extracts from yesterday's lobby meeting</b></p> <p><b> Chairman (John Sergeant, ITN):</b> Okey-dokey, Alastair's here.</p> <p><b> Alastair Campbell:</b> [Tony Blair's day] A business breakfast; schools seminar reception awards ceremony for most improved schools; the Genome project (Blair-Clinton statement) on which, I have to tell you, the depth of my knowledge has not developed during the course of the day; appointment at 5 o'clock of Scottish judges to the privy council to religious appointments.</p> <p>[AC then outlines the day's key written parliamentary answers to MPs' questions] Question 1: changes made to measures against FRY (Yugoslavia), question 2 on plans to call out members of the reserve to support the UN in Sierra Leone in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Charles Clarke launching the missing children website, John Denham speech to the NHS alliance and the royal society of GPs, Geoff Hoon speech on Kosovo, and Robin and Geoff Hoon both meeting the UN secretary general.</p> <p><b> Chairman:</b> Ok, questions?</p> <p><b> Q:</b> How do you approach the issue of televised debates? (a report that William Hague and Charles Kennedy want TV debates with Mr Blair before the election).</p> <p><b> AC:</b> Oh, I don't know. The story in the Independent that I saw was quoting Downing Street sources saying that they were shocked that the Tories were leaking details of our negotiations. Well, we weren't aware that there were any. I think there was some event last week organised by David Butler at which there were people from the parties including Tim Collins (Tory MP), I believe. But we get letters from broadcasters the whole time saying we'd like to organise this, that and the other. But I'm not aware of any negotiations going on at all. Certainly not involving No 10.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> Isn't there an argument for having discussions early, though, so that you don't do it in the heat of the ...</p> <p><b> AC: </b> There may well be, yeah, there may well be, but we're not - I'm not aware of those discussions going on.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> But you're not ruling it out as a possibility? You're not saying the prime minister would not want to take part in a debate of that sort as part of an election campaign?</p> <p><b> AC:</b> I'm saying that the, that there's no such discussions going on at the moment, although I know the broadcasters are obviously constantly trying to sound out the various parties. But it's something that we're not currently addressing and the point about - you remember the last time - a week's worth of - where it was the dominant issue. So I agree that if it's to be sorted, better sorted in the way that you describe. But I think that stuff today in the Independent looks to me like a bit of game playing by one of the parties.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> Frank Dobson's challenge to the others ?</p> <p><b> AC:</b> No - the mayoral candidates are having lots of these televised debates - it doesn't impact upon it at all - it's obvious that television is a very important medium in any election.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> Is the prime minister going to turn out and support Dobbo ?</p> <p><b> AC:</b> It's exactly the same as it was when anybody asked about it. The answer is yes, but we don't know, haven't go the dates.</p> <p>[AC then changes the subject to provide answers on tax levels which a reporter has asked for]</p> <p><b> AC:</b> George (Jones, Daily Telegraph), can I just say- if I haven't mislaid it - the tax burden, 97-98, 36.5% ...</p> <p><b> Q:</b> That's as a percentage of GDP, is it?</p> <p><b> AC:</b> Yes - it's the tax take as in the pre-budget report (PBR), or the budget red book. 97-98 35.6%; 98-99 37.4%; 99-00 37%; 00-01 36.8%; 01-02 37.2.% Projections under the Conservatives - if you've got them all lined up in order - it goes 36.0%; 36.4%; 36.9%; 37.4%; 37.8%. So that tax burden, assuming we continue on our course, will be lower, lower than under their projections.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> But under your figures 36.5%, 37%, 36.8% are higher than when you came in.</p> <p><b> AC:</b> Yeah - but also can I say in relation to the Tory figures don't forget that the Tory figure (in 1997) as inherited, included a \u00a328bn borrowing requirement - which is fundamentally sorted. Please don't ask me a complicated question about taxes.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> No, I don't understand what you're saying --what are these figures?</p> <p><b> AC:</b> Those are the figures as set out in their last the PBR - either budget or, whatever, red book, the projections, Tory projections had they been - yeah - I dunno - whenever.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> The last budget.</p> <p><b> AC:</b> 96-7 yeh .</p> <p><b> Q:</b> You've set out the facts, do you think it's a good thing?</p> <p><b> AC: </b> Set out facts - I always think it's a good thing to set out facts.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> I'm sure you do.The facts that you set out - do you think that this trend is a good thing?</p> <p><b> AC: </b> Well, which trend are you referring to?</p> <p><b> Q:</b> That fact that its a rising trend ...</p> <p><b> AC: </b> Well - the important thing as we've always said in relation to the economy, and our approach to the economy on coming into office, was to sort out the public finances and deal with the \u00a328bn borrowing requirement and to build stability, get more jobs into the economy - which we're, have done, and are continuing to do, to sort out - reform welfare, er, in the way we have done. So the -as I said this morning - the tax and spend argument is one that we've, we took on first within the party in opposition and now in government. The important thing is that you're running the economy properly, a genuine enterprising, competitive market economy. But also you are getting investment, proper investment, into public services alongside the modernisation that we're doing. So I mean, that's the approach we are taking. Now, if your question is about the morality, then I simply point out that his, their projections were for higher tax burden in the two years, this year and next year.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> It's just that when treasury ministers have been asked this question, and the prime minister, the answer tends to start from the middle years. So that what you seem to be suggesting now is that there is a virtue in what the government is doing ... the tax burden ... the trend is going up from the year that you came into office.</p> <p><b> AC:</b> Well, this year and the two years that we're in, it's falling, and then the projection's is for it to go up - but that's never been hidden. The figures are there for all to see. But what I think we are trying to do is to get over the fact that the outlook, the political argument, if you like, about the economy is not just about tax and spend. It is about the economy that you've got, it is about jobs, it is about welfare, it is about education and skills and that whole agenda and therefore that's why in our view the whole, the tax guarantee argument is flawed because you're saying that regardless of the state of the economy you're going to be cutting taxes, regardless of the state of the public finances you're going to be cutting taxes, and our argument is that in government you are constantly making - to coin a phrase - tough choices to meet all your objectives.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> But we are right in saying, are we not, that generally when asked, the government tends to say the tax burden has not risen since 1997, although Hague says tonight it has by 2.5 %. The treasury routinely says it has not increased taxes.</p> <p><b> AC:</b> The treasury do what I've just done, which is to give you the figures. But they're available. In the spirit of openness for which I'm rightly famed, I am merely giving you the facts so that you and, through you your public, can make a judgment. But you know, those figures are readily available. But this year and next year they're falling, but I do think it's important to get over this point that the figures that William Hague, well I haven't seen his speech, but if he's going back to when they were in power, it is important to bear in mind the \u00a328bn borrowing deficit, borrowing requirement. I mean that is the reason . It's tax deferred</p> <p><b> Q:</b> Alastair, I remember a long session in the Commonwealth Writing Room ( another briefing room) when you weren't prepared to say yes to the question you said yes to to George today about whether the tax burden has gone up in the years since you came into power. Isn't it fairly obvious to us that you now think the virtues of saying yes is to cheer up the heartlands of voters?</p> <p><b> AC:</b> Look, you've got the figures there, you've got the figures there.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> But why have you changed the strategy?</p> <p><b> AC: </b> I haven't changed the strategy at all. What I won't do is play their game. Or your game. Look, you've got it, this is your little heartland.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> Save your heartlands game, we're trying to be helpful about it.</p> <p><b> AC: </b> But it's not my game, Michael (White). It's not my game. As I said yesterday, look, this is your little prism that you've got for now, right. In a couple of weeks it'll be something else. It'll be, I don't know, coastal lands or something. It could be, you know, because of the BBC roadshow. I'd take that as given, including the Times there. So it's about, if you say to me, if George says to me, its 37.0% higher or lower than 37.4%, I mean, there's not much I can do to say that's it lower. Likewise its 37.2% higher than 36.8%, it's higher.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> But I seem to remember that at that Commonwealth Writing Room incident you said I'll answer the question how I see fit.</p> <p><b> AC:</b> But that's what I've done.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> But you're answering it today. I just wondered why the change of strategy.</p> <p><b> AC: </b> It's not a change of strategy. I mean I know you sort of, I know you, oh anyway- just write what you want ..</p> <p><b> Chair:</b> Right, next.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> Does the prime minister accept William Hague's basic point, which is in saying it's morally right to tax people less, or to tax people as little as you can. People have their own money to choose how they're spending it rather than giving it to the state?</p> <p><b> AC:</b> Well, look, you know, as I say it's for him to describe it in whatever way he wants. Government have obligations. Obligation number 1 in this area is to run the economy properly and competently, to generate the competitive economy that I have described, to get proper funding into public services. And that's what we're doing. And you know he's making a speech and he wants to get the coverage for the speech and it's entirely up to him how he decides to do that. I mean, I'm not going to complain about that. But, you know, I'm not a philosopher, I'm a spokesperson.</p> <p><b> Q:</b> You've changed, have you?</p> <p><b> AC:</b> Does your tabloid tell you how I used to crunch it all down and ...\"</p> <p><b> Q:</b> Five seconds, that's enough on economics.</p> <p><b> Different Q:</b> Next year, when it starts going up again?</p> <p><b> AC: </b> There are more people in the economy now paying tax. You know, because we have 800,000 more people working, though not all of them are paying tax and some of them have their income topped up in different ways.\"</p> <p><b> Q:</b> Didn't Labour have a tax guarantee?</p> <p><b> AC:</b> Yes, which we've implemented, which we've delivered. Yeah.</p> <p><b> Q: </b> That guarantee was that there'd be no tax increase at all</p> <p><b> AC: </b> No. The guarantee, as you know, was that there would be, er, the income tax, basic rate and top rate of tax would not go up.

      "bodyText": "For years it has been one of the worst-kept secrets in British politics. At 11 o'clock every weekday morning when parliament is sitting, the Downing Street spokesman, Alastair Campbell, briefs lobby correspondents on the day's agenda and fields their questions. Since the 1997 general election these exchanges have been formally on the record, quotable and attributed to \"the official Downing Street spokesman\". But not until today have Mr Campbell's words been attributable to him by name - though it is a household name to millions of politically minded people. Faced with complaints this week that he is allowing Michael Cockerell, a BBC documentary-maker to film some of his daily briefings, Mr Campbell conceded that his declared desire for anonymity is getting harder to sustain. \"I don't think this adds up to a row of beans. I speak as the prime minister's spokesman. We are a parliamentary democracy and the government is accountable to parliament,\" he said. Some MPs worry that Mr Campbell himself is not accountable enough. He says he is simply the conveyor of Mr Blair's words and intentions - which are often misrepresented by cynical, sensational or malign media. Nowadays Mr Campbell briefs in the basement of 10 Downing Street where 20 to 30 correspondents sit in rows of stackable chairs. Sir Bernard Ingham's customers perched on the arm of sofa in the press secretary's room in Lady Thatcher's day. So did those briefed by John Major's gentler spokesmen, Gus O'Donnell, Chris Meyer, now ambassador to Washington, and Jonathan Haslem, a career civil servant. Every afternoon they would repeat the performance in a room at the top of a Gothic turret high above the Thames in the Palace of Westminster. The day's agenda would have moved on by then. Instead of evening paper reporters and the TV/radio crowd, the morning papers would be more vocal. But times change. Academics, then columnists and leader writers deplored the secrecy of it all. The refurbished No 10 basement was part of the shake-up when 42-year-old Mr Campbell, combative former political editor of the Daily Mirror, moved into No 10 with Tony Blair in May 1997. He put his briefings on the record but kept them anonymous, to help lower his personal profile, al ready high enough for many Labour MPs and ministers. Mr Campbell also got himself a hybrid contract - part civil servant, part political adviser - which allowed him to mix it with journalists on party politics in a way which his many predecessors had been constrained from doing. He thus treads a fine line and critics, who include the pugnacious Sir Bernard, say he frequently steps over it. They also say he has \"politicised\" the entire government information system through the pernicious use of \"spin\" - an aggressive pro-government gloss on the day's facts. Yesterday's exchanges at 4 o'clock were pretty routine as Mr Campbell set out Mr Blair's day. Spokesman and reporters toss around ideas, claims and counter-claims as they always do. Few will find their way into print as stories this morning. Readers can compare his words with the summary now published daily on the Downing Street website. Critics of his deft skills will find the ammunition they want, while government loyalists will wonder at Mr Campbell's patience. He often wonders himself. Extracts from yesterday's lobby meeting Chairman (John Sergeant, ITN): Okey-dokey, Alastair's here. Alastair Campbell: [Tony Blair's day] A business breakfast; schools seminar reception awards ceremony for most improved schools; the Genome project (Blair-Clinton statement) on which, I have to tell you, the depth of my knowledge has not developed during the course of the day; appointment at 5 o'clock of Scottish judges to the privy council to religious appointments. [AC then outlines the day's key written parliamentary answers to MPs' questions] Question 1: changes made to measures against FRY (Yugoslavia), question 2 on plans to call out members of the reserve to support the UN in Sierra Leone in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Charles Clarke launching the missing children website, John Denham speech to the NHS alliance and the royal society of GPs, Geoff Hoon speech on Kosovo, and Robin and Geoff Hoon both meeting the UN secretary general. Chairman: Ok, questions? Q: How do you approach the issue of televised debates? (a report that William Hague and Charles Kennedy want TV debates with Mr Blair before the election). AC: Oh, I don't know. The story in the Independent that I saw was quoting Downing Street sources saying that they were shocked that the Tories were leaking details of our negotiations. Well, we weren't aware that there were any. I think there was some event last week organised by David Butler at which there were people from the parties including Tim Collins (Tory MP), I believe. But we get letters from broadcasters the whole time saying we'd like to organise this, that and the other. But I'm not aware of any negotiations going on at all. Certainly not involving No 10. Q: Isn't there an argument for having discussions early, though, so that you don't do it in the heat of the ... AC: There may well be, yeah, there may well be, but we're not - I'm not aware of those discussions going on. Q: But you're not ruling it out as a possibility? You're not saying the prime minister would not want to take part in a debate of that sort as part of an election campaign? AC: I'm saying that the, that there's no such discussions going on at the moment, although I know the broadcasters are obviously constantly trying to sound out the various parties. But it's something that we're not currently addressing and the point about - you remember the last time - a week's worth of - where it was the dominant issue. So I agree that if it's to be sorted, better sorted in the way that you describe. But I think that stuff today in the Independent looks to me like a bit of game playing by one of the parties. Q: Frank Dobson's challenge to the others ? AC: No - the mayoral candidates are having lots of these televised debates - it doesn't impact upon it at all - it's obvious that television is a very important medium in any election. Q: Is the prime minister going to turn out and support Dobbo ? AC: It's exactly the same as it was when anybody asked about it. The answer is yes, but we don't know, haven't go the dates. [AC then changes the subject to provide answers on tax levels which a reporter has asked for] AC: George (Jones, Daily Telegraph), can I just say- if I haven't mislaid it - the tax burden, 97-98, 36.5% ... Q: That's as a percentage of GDP, is it? AC: Yes - it's the tax take as in the pre-budget report (PBR), or the budget red book. 97-98 35.6%; 98-99 37.4%; 99-00 37%; 00-01 36.8%; 01-02 37.2.% Projections under the Conservatives - if you've got them all lined up in order - it goes 36.0%; 36.4%; 36.9%; 37.4%; 37.8%. So that tax burden, assuming we continue on our course, will be lower, lower than under their projections. Q: But under your figures 36.5%, 37%, 36.8% are higher than when you came in. AC: Yeah - but also can I say in relation to the Tory figures don't forget that the Tory figure (in 1997) as inherited, included a \u00a328bn borrowing requirement - which is fundamentally sorted. Please don't ask me a complicated question about taxes. Q: No, I don't understand what you're saying --what are these figures? AC: Those are the figures as set out in their last the PBR - either budget or, whatever, red book, the projections, Tory projections had they been - yeah - I dunno - whenever. Q: The last budget. AC: 96-7 yeh . Q: You've set out the facts, do you think it's a good thing? AC: Set out facts - I always think it's a good thing to set out facts. Q: I'm sure you do.The facts that you set out - do you think that this trend is a good thing? AC: Well, which trend are you referring to? Q: That fact that its a rising trend ... AC: Well - the important thing as we've always said in relation to the economy, and our approach to the economy on coming into office, was to sort out the public finances and deal with the \u00a328bn borrowing requirement and to build stability, get more jobs into the economy - which we're, have done, and are continuing to do, to sort out - reform welfare, er, in the way we have done. So the -as I said this morning - the tax and spend argument is one that we've, we took on first within the party in opposition and now in government. The important thing is that you're running the economy properly, a genuine enterprising, competitive market economy. But also you are getting investment, proper investment, into public services alongside the modernisation that we're doing. So I mean, that's the approach we are taking. Now, if your question is about the morality, then I simply point out that his, their projections were for higher tax burden in the two years, this year and next year. Q: It's just that when treasury ministers have been asked this question, and the prime minister, the answer tends to start from the middle years. So that what you seem to be suggesting now is that there is a virtue in what the government is doing ... the tax burden ... the trend is going up from the year that you came into office. AC: Well, this year and the two years that we're in, it's falling, and then the projection's is for it to go up - but that's never been hidden. The figures are there for all to see. But what I think we are trying to do is to get over the fact that the outlook, the political argument, if you like, about the economy is not just about tax and spend. It is about the economy that you've got, it is about jobs, it is about welfare, it is about education and skills and that whole agenda and therefore that's why in our view the whole, the tax guarantee argument is flawed because you're saying that regardless of the state of the economy you're going to be cutting taxes, regardless of the state of the public finances you're going to be cutting taxes, and our argument is that in government you are constantly making - to coin a phrase - tough choices to meet all your objectives. Q: But we are right in saying, are we not, that generally when asked, the government tends to say the tax burden has not risen since 1997, although Hague says tonight it has by 2.5 %. The treasury routinely says it has not increased taxes. AC: The treasury do what I've just done, which is to give you the figures. But they're available. In the spirit of openness for which I'm rightly famed, I am merely giving you the facts so that you and, through you your public, can make a judgment. But you know, those figures are readily available. But this year and next year they're falling, but I do think it's important to get over this point that the figures that William Hague, well I haven't seen his speech, but if he's going back to when they were in power, it is important to bear in mind the \u00a328bn borrowing deficit, borrowing requirement. I mean that is the reason . It's tax deferred Q: Alastair, I remember a long session in the Commonwealth Writing Room ( another briefing room) when you weren't prepared to say yes to the question you said yes to to George today about whether the tax burden has gone up in the years since you came into power. Isn't it fairly obvious to us that you now think the virtues of saying yes is to cheer up the heartlands of voters? AC: Look, you've got the figures there, you've got the figures there. Q: But why have you changed the strategy? AC: I haven't changed the strategy at all. What I won't do is play their game. Or your game. Look, you've got it, this is your little heartland. Q: Save your heartlands game, we're trying to be helpful about it. AC: But it's not my game, Michael (White). It's not my game. As I said yesterday, look, this is your little prism that you've got for now, right. In a couple of weeks it'll be something else. It'll be, I don't know, coastal lands or something. It could be, you know, because of the BBC roadshow. I'd take that as given, including the Times there. So it's about, if you say to me, if George says to me, its 37.0% higher or lower than 37.4%, I mean, there's not much I can do to say that's it lower. Likewise its 37.2% higher than 36.8%, it's higher. Q: But I seem to remember that at that Commonwealth Writing Room incident you said I'll answer the question how I see fit. AC: But that's what I've done. Q: But you're answering it today. I just wondered why the change of strategy. AC: It's not a change of strategy. I mean I know you sort of, I know you, oh anyway- just write what you want .. Chair: Right, next. Q: Does the prime minister accept William Hague's basic point, which is in saying it's morally right to tax people less, or to tax people as little as you can. People have their own money to choose how they're spending it rather than giving it to the state? AC: Well, look, you know, as I say it's for him to describe it in whatever way he wants. Government have obligations. Obligation number 1 in this area is to run the economy properly and competently, to generate the competitive economy that I have described, to get proper funding into public services. And that's what we're doing. And you know he's making a speech and he wants to get the coverage for the speech and it's entirely up to him how he decides to do that. I mean, I'm not going to complain about that. But, you know, I'm not a philosopher, I'm a spokesperson. Q: You've changed, have you? AC: Does your tabloid tell you how I used to crunch it all down and ...\" Q: Five seconds, that's enough on economics. Different Q: Next year, when it starts going up again? AC: There are more people in the economy now paying tax. You know, because we have 800,000 more people working, though not all of them are paying tax and some of them have their income topped up in different ways.\" Q: Didn't Labour have a tax guarantee? AC: Yes, which we've implemented, which we've delivered. Yeah. Q: That guarantee was that there'd be no tax increase at all AC: No. The guarantee, as you know, was that there would be, er, the income tax, basic rate and top rate of tax would not go up. The idea that we went into the election saying that petrol was going to stay at the same price forever, cigarettes were going to stay at the same price forever, is absurd and was never said. You're referring to the Financial Times which I know the Conservatives are very very keen on using it, but they use it, as indeed the FT at the time, out of context. Chair: Right. Change subject Q: I have been asked by my Scottish colleagues to ask why you felt obliged to attack the Scottish press last week? AC: I don't feel obliged to do anything. Chair: That's what you normally do. AC: I was asked my views and I gave them.

I like looking at the history stuff and I find I'm learning with her. If I did switch on the telly I think it would be to watch motor racing or a bit of comedy. Goodness Gracious Me is back and I love that. The woman who can make everything herself, she never buys anything from the shop, that's my wife.\" Leonard Pugh: \"I can't watch the telly without someone shouting or the kids arguing. I can never hear a thing. I try and hide the remote control so there isn't a full-scale war. My mother lives with us at the moment and she's worse, wants to watch all the soaps. We've got a TV in the bedroom so I sometimes sneak up there. Who do I like? Parkinson - Parky, he's still excellent. I end up watching This Is Your Life and more the old programmes, thinking, 'I never knew he had 45 children!' That sort of thing.\" Keith Jacobs: \"I don't get a lot of time to watch TV to be honest. I did have a phase of watching the cookery programmes and trying to improve my skills, honest! [Laughter from others.] I'm a very good cook. I did a bit of Delia, but she does simple stuff. I did like Two Fat Ladies, because they've got a no-nonsense approach, none of this poncey stuff, no bigger than a tuppence bit on a big plate. River Cafe, those Two Posh Ladies, that was crap. My best meal? Well, I can do a mean angel's hair pasta with crab.\" Jay Imani: \"I like Frasier, EastEnders, Friends, Gimme Gimme Gimme, sometimes a bit of Coronation Street, those Greece Uncovered programmes or whatever they are - the holiday ones where everyone goes mad, real life stuff. In fact, I'll watch anything on a Friday night, because that's pizza night. All my mates, some tins and Pizza Hut or Domino's - Pizza Hut has gone downhill though I must say.\" Interviews by Sin Pattenden",

Sadly, however, all we can do is bring you the latest sorry chapter in the Richard Pryor story, wherein the erstwhile stand-up pioneer and latter-day MS victim takes out a restraining order against his own offspring, the imaginatively named Richard Pryor Jr. The litigation, filed in LA Superior Court late last week, comes in response to the younger Pryor's attempts to take control of his father's estate, claiming Dad is now unable to \"shop, prepare his own meals or bathe himself\". Perhaps unsurprisingly, said allegation failed to go over at all well with Pryor Sr, who promptly fired off an application for his son to be kept at arm's length from his property and business affairs until further notice. \"Unfortunately,\" fumed Pop's attorney Lynda Larsen, \"because of Richard Jr's unwelcome and aggressive efforts to seek audience with his father, it was necessary to prepare requests for restraining orders\".

This will be the first time in the country's turbulent history that the left has dominated the political institutions at local and national level. \"We are now the leading political force in this country,\" said Fabio Castillo, the general secretary of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), a coalition of former guerrillas' groups that fought a 12-year civil war against successive US-backed governments. With some results still to come in from Sunday's legislative and municipal vote, the electoral tribunal confirmed yesterday that the FMLN won 31 of the 84 seats in congress, three more than the rightwing Alliance of Republican Nationalists (Arena). The FMLN also secured control over town councils in eight of the 14 provincial capitals, including the capital, San Salvador, where the leftwing incumbent, Hector Silva, convincingly beat the Arena candidate to win a second three-year term of office. Former guerrillas will now run the majority of councils in the most densely populated urban centres around San Salvador. More than 75,000 people were killed before a UN brokered peace treaty paved the way for a negotiated settlement in January 1992, under which the rebels disarmed and became a political party in return for sweeping reforms. In their first post-war venture into electoral politics, the former rebels were easily beaten by Arena in the 1994 general elections. But three years later, FMLN made important gains in legislative and municipal elections, winning 27 seats in congress and capturing the municipality of San Salvador, suggesting that voters had lost their distrust of the former guerrillas However, when the former rebels looked like splitting over their choice of candidate in last year's presidential elections, Arena won easily. Yesterday Arena's leaders were trying to put a brave face on their biggest electoral set-back in the party's 20 years of existence. Arena's president, Alfredo Cristiani, said: \"The population was looking for somewhat of a balance ...we don't consider that we have lost\". A worsening economic scenario, caused by plummeting world prices for the country's main export crops, with soaring crime are also seen as having worked against Arena, in power since 1989. Arena's traditional allies in the business sector have expressed disquiet about the FMLN's intention to challenge President Francisco Flores's neo-liberal economic policies. The left's campaigning platform included proposals to reduce value added tax, exert greater control over interest rates, and stimulate credit to small and medium-size enterprises.

Investigating magistrates claim some \u00a3200m passed through Mr Sirven's hands. They allege he kept some of it, and paid the rest to a number of former Elf directors and other senior figures now embroiled in l'affaire Elf . One of those alleged to have benefited is the former foreign minister Roland Dumas, who earlier this month resigned as as the country's top legal authority and will stand trial for abuse of funds later this year. Mr Dumas is accused of persuading Elf to employ his former mistress, Christine Deviers-Joncour, and of profiting from the \u00a36.6m allegedly channelled to her by Mr Sirven as \"commissions\" for lobbying her lover to approve the 1991 sale of six frigates to Taiwan by another state-controlled French firm, Thomson.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of illegal immigrants were arrested entering Greece last night, reinforcing fears that racism would become the hottest issue of the country's campaign for parliamentary elections on April 9. As parliament was dissolved yesterday in the run-up to the polls, police said they had detained more than 350 third world migrants who had been dumped on the island of Chios after paying Turkish smugglers to take them to the west. With widespread support for the economic and foreign policies of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), fears are mounting that the campaign will be fought on a xenophobic ticket. Civil rights groups, alarmed by police sweeps and the tabling of a tough new immigration bill, have voiced concern that politicians have begun to exploit prejudice over the presence of the 700,000, mostly illegal, immigrants who have settled in Greece. \"On an almost daily basis, politicians and commentators are making the sort of xenophobic speeches and remarks that would usually be attributed to leaders like [leader of Austria's Freedom party] J\u00f6rg Haider and [ French National Front leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen,\" said Panayiote Dimitras, of the human rights pressure group Helsinki Monitor. \"Since votes cannot be won on major political issues they are clearly trying to capitalise on the government's weakness around law and order and the perception that migrants are responsible for so many of this country's problems,\" he said. Greeks blame impoverished migrants for soaring crime and unemployment. Polls have shown that 70% of the population support the \"immediate repatriation\" of immigrants. Albanians, who make up more than three-fifths of the influx into the EU's only Balkan state, are particularly vilified. Since the announcement last month of the early election by the prime minister, Costas Simitis, hostility has intensified, immigrants say. Fear among Albanians has spurred many to avoid public spaces and speaking Albanian outside their homes. In recent weeks, police have stormed buses and subway exits in search of the \"illegals\" as part of a crackdown. Since the collapse of communism, Greece has become a magnet for migration with immigrants viewing its coastline and mountainous terrain as the most accessible back door to Fortress Europe. Many third world immigrants risk their lives to cross Greece's heavily-mined land border with Turkey. However, Greece still lacks a comprehensive immigration policy. Attempts to legalise the migrants - by granting them residency and work permits - have all but failed following the refusal of Greek employers to pay social security costs. The fear and loathing of Albanians has prompted villages in far-flung border areas to set up vigilante groups. The main opposition leader, Costas Karamanlis, toured northern Greece last week, saying he would make the fight against foreigner-related crime \"a top priority\". With their eye on a third consecutive term in office, the Socialists have promised to pass what civil rights campaigners regard as draconian immigration policies.

      "bodyText": "We have been asked to point out that Torsten Friedag, despite the impression we gave in a report, Head of fresh start school quits, page 7, March 11, was never appointed the head of George Orwell school in Islington, north London. He was appointed head-designate of Islington Arts and Media school, from January 1999, at a time when John Crew was head of George Orwell school, a position he retained until the school closed on August 31 last year. The school, then relaunched as Islington Arts and Media school, was refurbished at a cost of \u00a31.3m, not \u00a38m. We were wrong to state, page 4, March 13, that Deborah Bull was among those who applied for the post of artistic director of the Royal Ballet. She did not apply. Sorry for any embarrassment caused. It was incorrect to say, as we did on page 7, yesterday, that Mark Hedley, a supermarket manager diagnosed with HIV, had been \"sacked\". Mr Hedley's solicitor has emphasised the point we correctly made in our report, that Mr Hedley is on paid \"gardening leave\". That means he is still employed by Aldi but not allowed to return to work. Richard Crossman became Dick Crossland in our interview with Lord Longford, page 4, G2, March 13; and Hugh Gaitskell became Gaitskill. In our obituary of Laurence James (Gifted novelist of many names) we accidentally called him Harris towards the end of the piece. He was born in 1942, not 1943, making him 57, not 56. The series of books written as James Axler was called Deathlands, not Darklands. It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.

Although individual senate members, such as Phil Gramm of Texas, a leading member of the senate finance committee, back British membership, the proposal has failed to attract any enthusiasm from the White House and an invitation to join is not thought to be on the cards.",

A UK government source said yesterday: \"It is clearly in BA's interests to let the government know whether Ayling's dismissal means anything for their strategy in the transatlantic market.\" </p> <p>Mr Ayling's departure comes at a particularly awkward time in the negotiations to liberalise transatlantic airline routes. </p> <p>Direct talks effectively broke down in January and the negotiations have been marked by bitter and embarrassing rows ever since. Although UK government officials in Washington have made it clear that they are acting for \"UK plc\" and not just BA, the company's demands have helped shape government policy. </p> <p>Although Mr Ayling was believed to be instrumental in the company's failure to successfully lobby politicians in Washington and Brussels, his access to UK government members was believed to be crucial in garnering political support. The company's position is now less clear. </p> <p>In the wake of Mr Ayling's departure BA has reaffirmed its commitment to its premium passenger policy and, in the US, it broadly wants to fly to more destinations in conjunction with American Airlines, its US partner. However, Simon Walker, BA's director of communications, indicated that the company had to focus on \"internal administrative changes\" during the management upheaval before turning its attention to the US. </p> <p>The company was indirectly blamed for a bill, set to be passed by the US congress yesterday, that would allow the US government to impose sanctions on UK airlines.

A UK government source said yesterday: \"It is clearly in BA's interests to let the government know whether Ayling's dismissal means anything for their strategy in the transatlantic market.\" Mr Ayling's departure comes at a particularly awkward time in the negotiations to liberalise transatlantic airline routes. Direct talks effectively broke down in January and the negotiations have been marked by bitter and embarrassing rows ever since. Although UK government officials in Washington have made it clear that they are acting for \"UK plc\" and not just BA, the company's demands have helped shape government policy. Although Mr Ayling was believed to be instrumental in the company's failure to successfully lobby politicians in Washington and Brussels, his access to UK government members was believed to be crucial in garnering political support. The company's position is now less clear. In the wake of Mr Ayling's departure BA has reaffirmed its commitment to its premium passenger policy and, in the US, it broadly wants to fly to more destinations in conjunction with American Airlines, its US partner. However, Simon Walker, BA's director of communications, indicated that the company had to focus on \"internal administrative changes\" during the management upheaval before turning its attention to the US. The company was indirectly blamed for a bill, set to be passed by the US congress yesterday, that would allow the US government to impose sanctions on UK airlines. These could include preventing Concorde from flying to New York and cutting back on other flights.",

      "body": "<p>Eug\u00e8ne Labiche's play The Threesome was supposedly written in response to a critic's claim that adultery could never be funny - at least not for a polite audience. It centres on the activities of a man called Marjavel, his wife Hermance and her lover Ernest, who is also Marjavel's best friend. </p> <p>The play was first performed at the Th\u00e9tre du Palais-Royal in Paris on January 11, 1870, under the name of Le Plus Heureux des Trois. It was written (in collaboration with playwright Edmond Gondinet) for the leading comedians of the Palais-Royal - actors whose gifts and idiosyncrasies Labiche knew intimately and who were in effect the unnamed co-creators of the piece. It was part of Labiche's extraordinarily large output, in which new comedies and vaudevilles were manufactured in almost industrial quantities. They were phenomenally popular and critically acclaimed: no less a figure than Proust's Duchesse de Guermantes boasts, \"I've even read Labiche.\" </p> <p>The first collection of Labiche's work, published in 1878, features 57 pieces - and those are just the ones he preferred, not the complete works. The sheer quantity of Labiche's writing gives it a particular quality: it is precisely the fact that this is obviously commercial theatre, churned out to satisfy the vanity and prodigious appetite for entertainment in contemporary Paris, that gives such a delicious edge to its seriousness, its ability to unsettle, to induce something like panic as well as hilarity. </p> <p>Labiche's writing is a theatrical paradox. It is apparently realistic, using real urban places, habits and language: photographs of his actors show fleshy, substantial, utterly worldly people, on sets as crammed with real furniture as the plays are with concrete topical detail. It is also radically artificial: many of his plays rise from farce into vaudeville (most famously, The Italian Straw Hat), topping the intricacies of his quickfire dialogue with elaborate sung choruses. The trick that holds the paradox together is the oldest one in theatre - he constantly acknowledges and appeals to the audience. Labiche's theatre is one in which footlights exist only to be reached across - characters confide in and reveal themselves to the audience much more readily than they do to each other. They are familiar with us, and familiar to us. This apparently relaxed mood, however, can quickly spiral into anxiety as the plot tightens. </p> <p>I began translating Le Plus Heureux des Trois shortly after translating and producing Marivaux's 1744 work La Dispute. Surprisingly enough, given that Marivaux is so often fanciful and aristocratic and Labiche invariably contemporary and vulgar, the first was a great preparation for the second. These two authors share a gift for the two essentials of comedy, which any translation clouds or elaborates at its peril: great concision (characters are too busy dealing with situations to explain themselves or their feelings) and great cruelty. </p> <p>Labiche's theatre is remarkable for its sadism. Some of the tortures presented for our entertainment are directly physical, like the boiling water that Ernest \"accidentally\" pours over Marjavel's unruly groin at the close of act one.

      "bodyText": "Eug\u00e8ne Labiche's play The Threesome was supposedly written in response to a critic's claim that adultery could never be funny - at least not for a polite audience. It centres on the activities of a man called Marjavel, his wife Hermance and her lover Ernest, who is also Marjavel's best friend. The play was first performed at the Th\u00e9tre du Palais-Royal in Paris on January 11, 1870, under the name of Le Plus Heureux des Trois. It was written (in collaboration with playwright Edmond Gondinet) for the leading comedians of the Palais-Royal - actors whose gifts and idiosyncrasies Labiche knew intimately and who were in effect the unnamed co-creators of the piece. It was part of Labiche's extraordinarily large output, in which new comedies and vaudevilles were manufactured in almost industrial quantities. They were phenomenally popular and critically acclaimed: no less a figure than Proust's Duchesse de Guermantes boasts, \"I've even read Labiche.\" The first collection of Labiche's work, published in 1878, features 57 pieces - and those are just the ones he preferred, not the complete works. The sheer quantity of Labiche's writing gives it a particular quality: it is precisely the fact that this is obviously commercial theatre, churned out to satisfy the vanity and prodigious appetite for entertainment in contemporary Paris, that gives such a delicious edge to its seriousness, its ability to unsettle, to induce something like panic as well as hilarity. Labiche's writing is a theatrical paradox. It is apparently realistic, using real urban places, habits and language: photographs of his actors show fleshy, substantial, utterly worldly people, on sets as crammed with real furniture as the plays are with concrete topical detail. It is also radically artificial: many of his plays rise from farce into vaudeville (most famously, The Italian Straw Hat), topping the intricacies of his quickfire dialogue with elaborate sung choruses. The trick that holds the paradox together is the oldest one in theatre - he constantly acknowledges and appeals to the audience. Labiche's theatre is one in which footlights exist only to be reached across - characters confide in and reveal themselves to the audience much more readily than they do to each other. They are familiar with us, and familiar to us. This apparently relaxed mood, however, can quickly spiral into anxiety as the plot tightens. I began translating Le Plus Heureux des Trois shortly after translating and producing Marivaux's 1744 work La Dispute. Surprisingly enough, given that Marivaux is so often fanciful and aristocratic and Labiche invariably contemporary and vulgar, the first was a great preparation for the second. These two authors share a gift for the two essentials of comedy, which any translation clouds or elaborates at its peril: great concision (characters are too busy dealing with situations to explain themselves or their feelings) and great cruelty. Labiche's theatre is remarkable for its sadism. Some of the tortures presented for our entertainment are directly physical, like the boiling water that Ernest \"accidentally\" pours over Marjavel's unruly groin at the close of act one. Some are more sophisticated: a claustrophobic trapped in the stuffing of a sofa, a respectable wife constantly reduced to guilty panic. Some images or sounds of violence just contribute to the general air of potential punishment: the cracking of an offstage cab-driver's whip; the mysterious Aunt Isadore, condemned to hang forever from her window. It is a truism that farce needs to be played with \"attack\"; what this means, I think, is that the audience should feel that at any minute (after the first two minutes, say) there is the possibility of a character doing violence to another character, to themselves or possibly to the audience. This particular quality of attack sometimes finds climactic expression in an actual assault; often it is sublimated in apparently incidental details (as the maid Petunia says of her dusting, it's just displacement, really). The physical world (props, furniture, costume) in farce is animated by a strange malevolence and an unexpected talent for derangement - as if the silent, inanimate trappings of comfort were exacting a surreal sort of revenge on the well-ordered opulence of 19th-century bourgeois society.

      "body": "<p>The significance of the Buena Vista Social Club project - Ry Cooder's phenomenally successful rediscovery of classic Cuban folk music - lies in its star Compay Segundo's name. That the erstwhile Francisco Repilado should be nicknamed \"Comrade Second\" - because he tends to sing second harmony - bespeaks an effortlessly, indelibly musical culture. As the music of the English-speaking world suffocates in its shrink-wrapping, is it any wonder western punters are flocking to reconnect with less commercial, more spontaneous sounds? </p> <p>Hence the slightly condescending, noble-savage tone of Wim Wenders' documentary of the album, which had Cuba's greatest musicians blinking childlike through the streets of New York. Here were unsullied, innocent musicians - a term which can hardly be applied to that wily old dog Segundo, who was greeted with real affection at the Festival Hall. How strange it must seem to the wizened, wickedly grinning 93-year-old - who, pre-Cooder, had languished in obscurity since the 60s - to be cheered by a capacity crowd of London's glitterati and accosted onstage by young women with flowers. Stranger still for his son, silver-haired himself and playing double bass in dad's band. </p> <p>Not that Segundo looks, or acts, his age. Dancing onstage in trademark panama hat, he coyly unbuttons his jacket to show off a slinky sashay that would have put Elvis the Pelvis (two decades his junior) to shame. Standing, and shimmying, throughout the gig, he plucked nimbly at his customised guitar - a seven-string armonico he invented in the 20s - and, for percussive effect, repeatedly planted sloppy kisses on its side. </p> <p>The music - Cuban son, merengue and cha cha cha of the types Segundo pioneered in the 40s - is beautiful, and performed beautifully, Se gundo's deep, gentle voice underscored distinctively by three-part clarinet harmonies. It helped that clarinettist Rafael Inciarte was a showman to rival Segundo himself, urging the crowd to clap, to dance, to sing along. One longed to be with Segundo y Sus Muchachos in a ballroom somewhere, with rum unlimited and room to dance. </p> <p>And so one almost was by the concert's end, as the audience spilled from its seats, crowding the aisle and the front of the stage in shuffling, swaying delirium. The Cuban flag unfurled to cheers that bode well for Ken Livingstone. Wild whoops greeted the opening chords of Segundo's irresistible signature tune, Chan Chan, and its chant-along \"Compay, Compay\" refrain. Introduced before the gig as being \"in the middle stage of his career\", Segundo performed with the panache of a man who senses that his best years may, remarkably, be ahead of him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The significance of the Buena Vista Social Club project - Ry Cooder's phenomenally successful rediscovery of classic Cuban folk music - lies in its star Compay Segundo's name. That the erstwhile Francisco Repilado should be nicknamed \"Comrade Second\" - because he tends to sing second harmony - bespeaks an effortlessly, indelibly musical culture. As the music of the English-speaking world suffocates in its shrink-wrapping, is it any wonder western punters are flocking to reconnect with less commercial, more spontaneous sounds? Hence the slightly condescending, noble-savage tone of Wim Wenders' documentary of the album, which had Cuba's greatest musicians blinking childlike through the streets of New York. Here were unsullied, innocent musicians - a term which can hardly be applied to that wily old dog Segundo, who was greeted with real affection at the Festival Hall. How strange it must seem to the wizened, wickedly grinning 93-year-old - who, pre-Cooder, had languished in obscurity since the 60s - to be cheered by a capacity crowd of London's glitterati and accosted onstage by young women with flowers. Stranger still for his son, silver-haired himself and playing double bass in dad's band. Not that Segundo looks, or acts, his age. Dancing onstage in trademark panama hat, he coyly unbuttons his jacket to show off a slinky sashay that would have put Elvis the Pelvis (two decades his junior) to shame. Standing, and shimmying, throughout the gig, he plucked nimbly at his customised guitar - a seven-string armonico he invented in the 20s - and, for percussive effect, repeatedly planted sloppy kisses on its side. The music - Cuban son, merengue and cha cha cha of the types Segundo pioneered in the 40s - is beautiful, and performed beautifully, Se gundo's deep, gentle voice underscored distinctively by three-part clarinet harmonies. It helped that clarinettist Rafael Inciarte was a showman to rival Segundo himself, urging the crowd to clap, to dance, to sing along. One longed to be with Segundo y Sus Muchachos in a ballroom somewhere, with rum unlimited and room to dance. And so one almost was by the concert's end, as the audience spilled from its seats, crowding the aisle and the front of the stage in shuffling, swaying delirium. The Cuban flag unfurled to cheers that bode well for Ken Livingstone. Wild whoops greeted the opening chords of Segundo's irresistible signature tune, Chan Chan, and its chant-along \"Compay, Compay\" refrain. Introduced before the gig as being \"in the middle stage of his career\", Segundo performed with the panache of a man who senses that his best years may, remarkably, be ahead of him.",

In the tribunal, you co-respond when, for example, an applicant sues both the employer and a named individual for discrimination.

An NTL spokesman said take-up had been \"tremendous\" and continues to grow at rapid rate. </p> <p>Shares in Freeserve had been battered by the rival offers and lost 40% in value last week but managed to claw some back yesterday, closing 51p higher at 631.5p. </p> <p>Analysts will be watching Freeserve's third quarter figures tomorrow to see how much revenue is being generated from e-commerce and advertising on its portal. </p> <p>In the second quarter, Freeserve made a pre-tax loss of \u00a33.6m on turnover of \u00a33.8m - some \u00a32m of which was from Freeserve's share of call revenues, a number which will now drop sharply. </p> <p>For its product via a BT line, Freeserve is paying the network operator \u00a35.99 a month while the remaining \u00a31 will be eaten up transferring the call to the ISP's servers. All voice call revenues from the Energis package will be retained by the telecoms company. </p> <p>A Freeserve spokesman said the company was unconcerned by the potential drop in revenues because of the extra time people would spend on the internet. \"We always said that we would expect e-commerce and advertising revenues to outweigh connectivity revenues, and the longer people spend online the more opportunities there are. We are not just an ISP, we are a portal which aggregates content.\" </p> <p>Analysts remained cautious about the quality of Freeserve's content and its ability to drive e-commerce and advertising revenues. Gerard van Hamel Platerink at Salomon Smith Barney said: \"The value in Freeserve is not as an ISP but as a portal so the more time people spend online the better. Freeserve now needs to do the right content deals to keep people at its site, and at the moment they haven't done enough.\" </p> <p>Freeserve, which is 80% owned by electrical goods retailer Dixons, turned the internet access market upside down when it became the first to drop monthly subscription fees in September 1998. It rapidly became the country's leading ISP and has 1.67m users. </p> <p>Internet service providers are under considerable political pressure to reduce the cost of accessing the web.</p>",

Analysts will be watching Freeserve's third quarter figures tomorrow to see how much revenue is being generated from e-commerce and advertising on its portal. In the second quarter, Freeserve made a pre-tax loss of \u00a33.6m on turnover of \u00a33.8m - some \u00a32m of which was from Freeserve's share of call revenues, a number which will now drop sharply. For its product via a BT line, Freeserve is paying the network operator \u00a35.99 a month while the remaining \u00a31 will be eaten up transferring the call to the ISP's servers. All voice call revenues from the Energis package will be retained by the telecoms company. A Freeserve spokesman said the company was unconcerned by the potential drop in revenues because of the extra time people would spend on the internet. \"We always said that we would expect e-commerce and advertising revenues to outweigh connectivity revenues, and the longer people spend online the more opportunities there are. We are not just an ISP, we are a portal which aggregates content.\" Analysts remained cautious about the quality of Freeserve's content and its ability to drive e-commerce and advertising revenues. Gerard van Hamel Platerink at Salomon Smith Barney said: \"The value in Freeserve is not as an ISP but as a portal so the more time people spend online the better. Freeserve now needs to do the right content deals to keep people at its site, and at the moment they haven't done enough.\" Freeserve, which is 80% owned by electrical goods retailer Dixons, turned the internet access market upside down when it became the first to drop monthly subscription fees in September 1998. It rapidly became the country's leading ISP and has 1.67m users. Internet service providers are under considerable political pressure to reduce the cost of accessing the web.",
