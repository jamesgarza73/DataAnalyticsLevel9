I have never had a conversation with her,\" he said. However, a spokesman for the newspaper said it was standing by its story. It follows a series of damaging allegations about Edwards' relationship with United's manager Sir Alex Ferguson. Last night a source close to the plc board said the latest round of negative publicity might severely damage Edwards' hopes of succeeding Sir Roland Smith as chairman of the plc. \"Members of the plc board are acutely aware that they have a duty to the shareholders and the supporters and they do not need telling about the average opinion on the street of Martin Edwards,\" the source said. Smith, 71, is expected to step down as chairman of the plc within six months. Privately he has made little effort to conceal his disquiet at the slow drip of allegations against Edwards, who was also heavily criticised for his role in BSkyB's abortive bid to buy the club. It is becoming clear that other board members would entertain the prospect of another big hitter mounting a challenge to Edwards, who had been expected to be shoehorned into the role as the only viable contender. His most likely rival is Roy Gardner, the chief executive of Centrica and a life-long United supporter who was appointed as an independent non-executive director this month. \"It is too early to speculate whether someone else will go for the chairmanship, but it would certainly be an option,\" said the source. Last night the pressure group Shareholders United expressed its disquiet at the prospect of Edwards succeeding Smith. \"It is our view that Martin Edwards is the wrong man to take the post,\" said its spokesman Oliver Houston. \"We are not concerned with the ups and downs of his personal life, but we are concerned with the ups and downs of the club's share price. \"His judgment has repeatedly been called into question, not least by investors in the City, who fear bad press could tarnish the club's reputation across the world.\"",

He claimed that the \"waves of hatred\" following the book had robbed him and his four children of their future financial security. </p> <p>Richard Rampton QC, for Professor Lipstadt and Penguin, savaged Mr Irving. He quoted a 1991 speech in which Mr Irving allegedly rubbished the idea that the Auschwitz camp existed to murder Jews. </p> <p>\"I don't see any reason to be tasteful about Auschwitz,\" Mr Irving said, according to Mr Rampton. \"It's baloney, it's a legend. Once we admit the fact that it was a brutal slave labour camp and large numbers of people did die, as large numbers of innocent people died elsewhere in the war, why believe the rest of the baloney? </p> <p>\"I say quite tastelessly, in fact, that more women died on the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber in Auschwitz. </p> <p>\"Oh, you think that's tasteless, how about this? There are so many Auschwitz survivors going around, in fact the number increases as the years go past, which is biologically very odd to say the least. I'm going to form an association of Auschwitz Survivors, Survivors of the Holocaust and other liars, or the ASSHOLS.\" </p> <p>In the same speech in Calgary, Canada, said Mr Rampton, Mr Irving complained about Jewish protests at his being granted a platform and is alleged to have said: \"And it's happening now. They're zeroing in on the university [saying] 'Nazism not welcome here. Self-professed moderate fascist' - I strongly object to that word 'moderate'.\" </p> <p>There was standing room only at court 37 at the high court in London. </p> <p>Mr Irving is representing himself in the trial, expected to last around three months and being heard without a jury because of the complexity of the evidence. He sat impassively as the defence detailed alleged falsehoods from his books about the second world war. </p> <p>Mr Rampton said: \"Mr Irving calls himself a historian. The truth is, however, that he is not a historian at all, but a falsifier of history. To put it bluntly, he is a liar. </p> <p>\"Lies take many forms ... but in the end all forms of lying converge into a single definition: wilful, deliberate mis-statement of the facts. </p> <p>\"Moreover, the lies which the defendants in this case will show that Mr Irving has told concern an area of history in which, perhaps, it behoves any writer or researcher to be particularly careful of the truth: the destruction of the Jews by the Nazis during world war two - the Holocaust - and Adolf Hitler's role in that human catastrophe.\" </p> <p>Mr Rampton continued: \"Mr Irving is nowadays a Holocaust denier. By this I mean that he denies that the Nazis planned and carried out the systematic murder of millions of Jews, in particular - though by no means exclusively - by the use of homicidal gas chambers, and in particular - though by no means exclusively - at Auschwitz in southern Poland.\" </p> <p>Mr Rampton said the tell tale evidence of Mr Irving's attitudes were that he addressed audiences that often consisted of \"radical right-wing, neo-fascist, neo-Nazi groups of people\". </p> <p>Mr Rampton said the case was not primarily about whether the Holocaust occurred or Hitler's complicity: \"the essence of the case is Mr Irving's honesty and integrity as a chronicler - I shy away from the word historian - of these matters. </p> <p>\"For if it be right that Mr Irving, driven by his extremist views and sympathies, has devoted his energies to the deliberate falsification of this tragic episode in history, then, by exposing that dangerous fraud in this court, the defence may properly be applauded for having performed a significant public service.\" </p> <p>Mr Irving likened the charge that he was a Holocaust denier to \"a yellow verbal star\". </p> <p>In the book Professor Lipstadt had branded Irving as one of the most prominent and dangerous Holocaust deniers. </p> <p>He said: \"The word 'Holocaust' is an artificial label commonly attached to one of the greatest and still most unexplained tragedies of this past century.\" </p> <p>He said Professor Lipstadt had used the phrase 'Holocaust denier' repeatedly and took pride in coining it. </p> <p>\"Meaningless though it is, the phrase has become a part of the English language. It is a poison to which there is virtually no antidote, less lethal than a hypodermic with nerve gas jabbed in the neck, but deadly all the same: for the chosen victim, it is like being called a wife-beater or a paedophile. </p> <p>\"It is enough for the label to be attached, for the attachee to find himself designated as a pariah.\" </p> <p>Mr Irving, 62, opened his claim for damages in a speech where at times his voice broke with emotion. Sometimes slapping the table in front of him, he said far from denying the slaughter of Jews he had unearthed documents revealing new aspects of the Holocaust. </p> <p>Mr Irving told Mr Justice Gray: \"By virtue of the activities of the defendants ... I have since 1996 seen one fearful publisher after another falling away from me, declining to reprint my works, refusing to accept new commissions and turning their backs on me when I approach. </p> <p>\"Such is the nature of the odium that has been generated by the waves of hatred recklessly propagated against me by the defendants.\" </p> <p>He told the court that the book had slashed his earnings which once reached \u00a3100,000 a year from his writing. </p> <p>Mr Irving said that for Professor Lipstadt to win the case and justify the charges of manipulation and distortion, she would have to show that \"I knew what happened; and that I perversely and deliberately portrayed it differently from how I knew it to have happened\". </p> <p>Mr Irving condemned laws in Germany aimed at protecting the memory of the Holocaust: \"Some good friends of mine are sitting at this very moment in German prisons\" after questioning the scale, system and numbers of dead. </p> <p>He said he felt no \"shame\" that he himself was fined in Germany under these laws for saying the gas chamber at Auschwitz seen by tourists \"is a fake built by the Poles after the war, just like the one established by the Americans at Dachau\". </p> <p>\"Fifty years on,\" said Mr Irving, \"it has become a criminal offence to question whether Nuremberg [war crimes trials] got it right.

Senator Pinochet was arrested in London on 16 October 1998, pursuant to a warrant issued by the 5th central magistrates' court in Madrid. He has been held since that date on bail.</p> <p>2. Following the second judgment of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords in March 1999, on 14 April 1999 I issued a second Authority to Proceed in respect of offences of torture and conspiracy to torture alleged to have been committed by Senator Pinochet after December 1988.</p> <p>3. On 16 May 1999 Senator Pinochet's solicitors applied for permission for a judicial review of that decision by me. The state of Senator Pinochet's health was not among the grounds advanced by his legal representatives. At the hearing on 27 May last year the application for permission for judicial review against me was dismissed. The extradition hearing took place between 27 and 30 September 1999 at the Bow Street Magistrate's Court. On 8 October 1999 the Bow Street magistrate committed Senator Pinochet on all charges to await my decision on surrender.</p> <p>4. Reports about Senator Pinochet's medical condition were taken into account by me in taking both of my decisions on the ATPs but at those stages I had no reason to doubt his fitness to stand trial. Since the ATP stage, Senator Pinochet has not made direct representations to me about his medical condition.</p> <p>5. However, on 14 October 1999, representations were however submitted by the Chilean Embassy, attaching recent medical reports on Senator Pinochet. They suggested that there had been a recent and significant deterioration in his medical condition.</p> <p>6. I have a clear legal duty to operate the Extradition Act in full and in the light of the information from the Chilean embassy that duty involved informing myself of the true facts about his health.</p> <p>7. I therefore asked Senator Pinochet to undergo a thorough and extensive medical examination, to be undertaken by an independent team of clinicians. Senator Pinochet gave his consent. He was entitled to the usual patient confidentiality and he has chosen to exercise that right. He did agree to disclosure of the report to me and to the UK prosecuting authorities.</p> <p>8. On the advice of this Government's Chief medical officer, I appointed a team of clinicians of outstanding national and international reputation. They were:</p> <p>\u0095 Sir John Grimley Evans, Professor of Clinical Geratology of the University of Oxford; <br>\u0095 Dr Michael Denham, Consultant Physician in Geriatric Medicine Northwick Park Hospital; <br>\u0095 Andrew Lees, Professor of Neurology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London; and <br>\u0095 Maria Wyke, a Consultant Neuropsychologist.</p> <p>9. It was established that they had no inappropriate personal interest in the case. The examination took place on 5 January 2000.</p> <p>10. My officials received the team's report late on January 6 and I considered it with advice over last weekend.</p> <p>11. The unequivocal and unanimous conclusion of the three medical practitioners and the consultant neuropsychologist was that, following recent deterioration in the state of Senator Pinochet's health, which seems to have occurred principally during September and October 1999, he is at present unfit to stand trial, and that no change to that position can be expected.</p> <p>12. I have therefore told Senator Pinochet's legal representatives that, subject to any representations I may receive, I am minded to take the view that no purpose would be served by continuing the present extradition proceedings.</p> <p>13. I have written formally to the Crown Prosecution Service as representatives of the Kingdom of Spain, and the Government of Chile, as well as to France, Belgium and Switzerland who have outstanding extradition requests. Letters have also gone to a number of human rights organisations inviting them to submit any further representations which they consider I should take into account within the next 7 days.</p> <p>Madam Speaker,</p> <p>14. Throughout these proceedings, I have not been able to make any oral statement to the House because of my quasi-judicial role in respect of extradition matters and because of the sub judice rules of this House. I have always made clear that I would make a full oral statement when the matter has finally been resolved, which of course I shall do. Meanwhile, I have to maintain an open mind on this matter and I hope the House will understand that until the matter is finally concluded, what I can say is bound heavily to be circumscribed.</p>",

Walking one day towards the warehouse in Swan Alley near London Wall he meets, in the otherwise deserted street, three or four women coming toward him wearing high-crowned hats. Reaching the warehouse he finds it broken open. Inside, half a dozen more women are trying on a consignment of the hats, meant for export, 'fitting themselves . . . as unconcerned and quiet as if they had been at a hatter's shop'. It is a dream-like scene: the fashionable looters, each looking for her size, while around them London rots and grass grows in the Strand. It is also a striking demonstration of Freya Stark's maxim that 'there are few sorrows through which a new dress or hat will not send a little gleam of pleasure however fugitive.' </p> <p>Clothes, the things that intervene between our naked selves and the world, affect our sense of both. They speak for - or against - us in complex, sometimes unpredictable ways, and they speak even when we are silent. 'Dressed in a tramp's clothes,' George Orwell, quoted by Judith Watt, observed, 'it is very difficult . . . not to feel that you are genuinely degraded.' The hope that a change of clothes will actually redress our situation is not therefore entirely vain, in either sense of the word. </p> <p>In the 20th century, of which three of these books offer surveys, the appearance of men altered relatively little while women's was transformed. An Edwardian office clerk meeting his modern counterpart in the City would know him at once, even without a hat. His wife, however, would be thunderstruck by a trip to Selfridges, for so much of female clothing has been invented since her day, including things it is hard now to believe were 'invented' at all. Among the innovations of the last hundred years are knickers with a closed crotch; separates (tops and skirts that could be worn in different combinations); trousers; and, the great couturier Paul Poiret's stroke of genius, a dress that a woman could put on without assistance. </p> <p>This discrepancy between women's experience and men's may be one reason why dress has come to be seen as a predominantly female subject, or at least one that is expressed in female terms. It is common enough to find books which purport to be about some universal aspect of human experience but turn out, on closer inspection, to be mostly about men. In the glass of fashion, however, all is reversed. Mendes and de la Haye write in their introduction that fashion is 'an indicator of individual, group and sexual identity' whose 'fluidity reflects shifts in the social matrix'; yet of the 280 illustrations that follow, nearly 250 are of women. </p> <p>High fashion, defined by Oscar Wilde as 'a form of ugliness so unbearable that we are compelled to alter it every six months', has been a predominantly female phenomenon since the late 18th century. For reasons historians tend to associate plausibly if vaguely with the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution and the ever emerging middle class, male dress has been relatively sober and static for two hundred years. What happened in the 20th century, Judith Watt suggests in her introduction to Fashion Writing, was that the whole subject of clothes came to be seen as feminine or effeminate. Hence her anthology, which includes journalism, extracts from novels and some verse, is disproportionately short on male writers. Dickens and Thackeray could use clothes to establish character in a way that was not, it seems, so readily available in the next century. </p> <p>It is hard to find instances that she has missed. She could have had Betjeman and Eliot - Prufrock after all exists largely through his clothes. But I doubt many men born since 1918 could equal the precision of 'my collar mounting firmly to the chin,/My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin'. As for descriptions of women's clothes, Watt is surely right about the decline of what Virginia Woolf called 'frock consciousness' in literature. Ted Hughes's 'A Pink Wool Knitted Dress', from Birthday Letters, which Watt includes, is an account of his and Sylvia Plath's wedding. She wore what the title suggests, but beyond repeating the phrase twice within the poem Hughes is terribly vague. Was it long? Did it have sleeves? What shade of pink? </p> <p>He is much too much of a man to notice - though he describes his own outfit well enough. What might be gained from saying more about Plath's is clear from the use of clothes in her own writing. Watt includes a passage from The Bell Jar but not the one where Plath's narrator, increasingly unable to inhabit the personality she has tried to assume, comes to resent her fashionable clothes, which take on a 'separate, mulish identity'. One night she throws them off the roof of her hotel in Manhattan, starting with 'a strapless elasticised slip which, in the course of wear, had lost its elasticity'. Waving it 'like a flag of truce' she lets it flutter off across the New York skyline, bearing with it in the precision of description, some of the false promise of Fifties push-up, long-line femininity. </p> <p>Neither Plath nor Woolf, though ambivalent about high fashion, ever seemed to worry that an interest in clothes would trivialise them. Feminism has occasionally taken that point of view but it has never prevailed. Mrs Pankhurst encouraged her supporters to dress smartly if discreetly, realising that slovenliness is next to sluttishness in the public mind and would make them and their cause more vulnerable. Women are taken more seriously if they obviously take care of their appearance. So why should men have felt obliged to profess such indifference to dress in the last century? One explanation offered by historians is the emergence of 'homosexuality' as a supposedly discrete syndrome. The trial of Oscar Wilde is cited, most recently by Christopher Breward, as a turning point after which any deviation in male clothes was seen as simply deviant. Like the French Revolution argument, this is surely only a partial truth. </p> <p>For whatever reason, however, it is true that the average heterosexual man, once he hits middle age, becomes wary of expressing an interest in clothes, his own or anyone else's. He is not unaware of them, merely inarticulate. There are certain key garments - dinner jacket, shell suit, cardigan - on which he will know at once where he stands. But when he wants to project his physical identity on the world, drop designer names and spend thousands of pounds on useless accessories, he does it with a car. His role in the insider-out world of fashion where women and homosexuals (and, since the late Fifties, the young) are in apparent charge, is oblique. </p> <p>It is sometimes suggested that fashion is either something inflicted by men on women or that it is engaged in by women for the benefit of men. Neither is usually true, nor do the proponents of such ideas fall into predictable political camps. Joan Smith, quoted by Watt, blows John Berger's famous dictum that 'men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at' smartly out of the water as just another male fantasy. If they are interested in clothes, women look at other women, because their clothes are more interesting. It might be truer to say that fashionable women's clothes were, for most of the century, the area in which certain aesthetic and social ideas concerning both sexes found their expression. </p> <p>De la Haye and Mendes offer a thorough if unadventurous account of what these have been. Baudot, who does not have to fit into a series format, goes further in making links with other art forms. Occasionally his unblushing Gallic conviction that nothing of any importance ever happened outside Paris stretches credulity. Swinging London cannot be entirely dismissed as an 'eccentricity that coincided with the loss of empire', but like de la Haye and Mendes he writes with clarity and authority about broader events. Two world wars, the disappearance of domestic staff, Constructivism, contraception and the Ballets Russes all have a part to play. However, the myth that hemlines fell in 1929 because of the Wall Street Crash is not allowed to stand. The collections, de la Haye and Mendes point out, had already been designed before it happened, fashion in this instance being more forward-thinking than finance. </p> <p>The question of what is cause and what effect, of who is influencing whom - men or women, designers or consumers, world affairs or waistlines - is a recurring theme. If historians sometimes simplify connections between fashion and other cultural trends they do at least provide an antidote to the megalomania of designers, who often think the opposite is true, that history actually follows fashion. 'Lucille', the nom de salon of the couturiere Lady Duff Gordon, was convinced that the short skirts and clean, liberated lines of interwar styles were entirely a product of the fashion houses' need to economise. 'Critics wrote learnedly of the \"modern girl's emancipation\",' she noted contemptuously. 'But neither the \"modern girl\" nor her critics knew she was a creation of . . . the rue de la Paix!' Such claims, like Poiret's, must, as de la Haye and Mendes say, be treated with caution, but not incredulity. </p> <p>Paris couture, which dominated fashion for the first half of the century, was taken seriously far beyond the salons. Both Sam Goldwyn and Adolf Hitler tried to manipulate it - Hitler tried to attract the couturiers to Berlin. Neither got what they wanted. Hitler, of course, like Mussolini, who actively set out to found an Italian fashion industry to compete with the French, was associated with some of the most stylised and stylish garments of the century. The SS uniforms were the epitome of male fear of fashion, all elements of personal expression denied and sublimated to the point of fetishism. From the Forties onwards overtly fashionable male dress was by definition anti-authoritarian or counter-cultural. In 1943 the 'zoot-suit' riots in Harlem, in which young Malcolm X took part, set a fashion for the Parisian 'zazous', men whose clothes marked them out as jazz fans and passive defiers of the German Occupation. </p> <p>It was in the interwar years that, in Europe at least, women dominated fashion as designers. Chanel, Vionnet and Schiaparelli created clothes intended (whatever Lucille thought) to liberate women and to feel as good on the body as they looked to the eye. If Watt's anthology has a fault - apart from a shocking number of transposed lines - it is the absence of E.M.Delafield, whose 'Diary of a Provincial Lady' appeared throughout the Thirties in Time and Tide, making brilliant cartoon-like use of clothes. Her description of an artistic party in Little James Street is worth a chapter of socio-historical analysis of the interwar gar\u008donne: 'Emma - in green sacque that looks exactly like demode window-curtain, sandals and varnished toe-nails . . . Am struck by presence of many pairs of horn-rimmed spectacles and marked absence of evening dress . . . Strange man enters into conversation with me . . . (Query: Who was Sappho and what was Isle of Lesbos?)' </p> <p>Watt does include part of Muriel Spark's The Girls of Slender Means set in the May of Teck, a women's club, during the Blitz. For special occasions the girls share a taffeta evening dress by Schiaparelli, its warm colours and panniered hips setting off each wearer slightly differently. Spark shows how the eroticism of clothes goes way beyond wearing a dress to attract a man, allowing the reader to observe, as the girls themselves do not, that the sharing of the dress is in itself exciting to men. </p> <p>After the war the range of garments available to women expanded hugely, while those acceptable to men who did not want to make a spectacle of themselves continued to dwindle until the Sixties. Plus-fours, spats, hats and even waistcoats largely disappeared. The tie was almost the only thing left that allowed a degree of personal expression without attracting suspicions of camp. Watt includes Alan Jenkins's touching elegy for his father, whom he conjures up through the ties he wore and which Jenkins remembers borrowing down to the last - 'a sort of crepe he bought for funerals, and hated'. </p> <p>As Breward argues was the case for the 19th century, so today the vocabulary of conventional male dress, though limited - almost covert - is precise and meaningful. A tie is still enough to mark one male out to another and provoke a clash of antlers. One of Watt's best passages is from Joe Orton's diary for 22 July 1967. </p> <p>Went to Peter Willes for dinner. When we got there he stared at Kenneth in horror. 'That's an old Etonian tie!' he screeched. </p> <p>'Yes,' Kenneth said, 'it's a joke.' </p> <p>Willes looked staggered . . . 'Well, I'm afraid it's a joke against you then. People will imagine you're passing yourself off as an old Etonian.' </p> <p>'I'm sending up Eton,' Kenneth said. </p> <p>'Oh, no!' Willes cackled . . . 'You're just pathetic! . . . People will know.' </p> <p>'Not the people I meet,' Kenneth said. 'They'll think it's funny.' </p> <p>Willes said . . . 'People dislike you enough already . . . it's permissible . . . as a foible of youth, but you - a middle-aged nonentity - it's sad.' </p> <p>'Irony', the most prized fashion accessory of the late 20th century is, as poor Kenneth Halliwell discovered, a fragile thing, entirely dependent on context. His tie was funny when he left home but all the humour evaporated when he got to Willes's. Whether a clothes joke is on the wearer or the world is another of the tricky demarcation lines in dress. De la Haye and Mendes note that after the war some French couturiers, accused of collaboration, defended themselves on the grounds that the clothes they made for German women were so obviously meant to make them look ridiculous they counted as resistance. It is an argument any number of designers might still deploy in the event of a sudden change of regime. </p> <p>By the end of the Fifties couture was virtually extinct. The catwalk shows of today come somewhere between cabaret and performance art, promoting an attitude rather than specific garments. Fashion houses make their money on scent and accessories. So far, indeed, has design come from couture that Issey Miyake's current collection takes irony to the edge of credibility by offering clothes, or rather cloths, that buyers have to cut out and make up for themselves. </p> <p>Since the Eighties, women have shown signs of following the male example, retreating into the kind of sombre dress for work and evening wear men have favoured for so long. Suits, plain fabrics and dark colours, especially black, predominate. While this can still be interesting, as Valerie Mendes's Black in Fashion shows, we may be in danger of losing frock consciousness both in life and writing, which would be a loss indeed. H.G. Wells thought it was of little literary importance, saying of Henry James that he was 'a formalist. He always thought of clothes. He was never intimate with anyone.' Yet James's was by far the subtler understanding of human personality, that phenomenon that crystallises where the self and not-self meet, as they always must in clothes.</p>",

Walking one day towards the warehouse in Swan Alley near London Wall he meets, in the otherwise deserted street, three or four women coming toward him wearing high-crowned hats. Reaching the warehouse he finds it broken open. Inside, half a dozen more women are trying on a consignment of the hats, meant for export, 'fitting themselves . . . as unconcerned and quiet as if they had been at a hatter's shop'. It is a dream-like scene: the fashionable looters, each looking for her size, while around them London rots and grass grows in the Strand. It is also a striking demonstration of Freya Stark's maxim that 'there are few sorrows through which a new dress or hat will not send a little gleam of pleasure however fugitive.' Clothes, the things that intervene between our naked selves and the world, affect our sense of both. They speak for - or against - us in complex, sometimes unpredictable ways, and they speak even when we are silent. 'Dressed in a tramp's clothes,' George Orwell, quoted by Judith Watt, observed, 'it is very difficult . . . not to feel that you are genuinely degraded.' The hope that a change of clothes will actually redress our situation is not therefore entirely vain, in either sense of the word. In the 20th century, of which three of these books offer surveys, the appearance of men altered relatively little while women's was transformed. An Edwardian office clerk meeting his modern counterpart in the City would know him at once, even without a hat. His wife, however, would be thunderstruck by a trip to Selfridges, for so much of female clothing has been invented since her day, including things it is hard now to believe were 'invented' at all. Among the innovations of the last hundred years are knickers with a closed crotch; separates (tops and skirts that could be worn in different combinations); trousers; and, the great couturier Paul Poiret's stroke of genius, a dress that a woman could put on without assistance. This discrepancy between women's experience and men's may be one reason why dress has come to be seen as a predominantly female subject, or at least one that is expressed in female terms. It is common enough to find books which purport to be about some universal aspect of human experience but turn out, on closer inspection, to be mostly about men. In the glass of fashion, however, all is reversed. Mendes and de la Haye write in their introduction that fashion is 'an indicator of individual, group and sexual identity' whose 'fluidity reflects shifts in the social matrix'; yet of the 280 illustrations that follow, nearly 250 are of women. High fashion, defined by Oscar Wilde as 'a form of ugliness so unbearable that we are compelled to alter it every six months', has been a predominantly female phenomenon since the late 18th century. For reasons historians tend to associate plausibly if vaguely with the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution and the ever emerging middle class, male dress has been relatively sober and static for two hundred years. What happened in the 20th century, Judith Watt suggests in her introduction to Fashion Writing, was that the whole subject of clothes came to be seen as feminine or effeminate. Hence her anthology, which includes journalism, extracts from novels and some verse, is disproportionately short on male writers. Dickens and Thackeray could use clothes to establish character in a way that was not, it seems, so readily available in the next century. It is hard to find instances that she has missed. She could have had Betjeman and Eliot - Prufrock after all exists largely through his clothes. But I doubt many men born since 1918 could equal the precision of 'my collar mounting firmly to the chin,/My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin'. As for descriptions of women's clothes, Watt is surely right about the decline of what Virginia Woolf called 'frock consciousness' in literature. Ted Hughes's 'A Pink Wool Knitted Dress', from Birthday Letters, which Watt includes, is an account of his and Sylvia Plath's wedding. She wore what the title suggests, but beyond repeating the phrase twice within the poem Hughes is terribly vague. Was it long? Did it have sleeves? What shade of pink? He is much too much of a man to notice - though he describes his own outfit well enough. What might be gained from saying more about Plath's is clear from the use of clothes in her own writing. Watt includes a passage from The Bell Jar but not the one where Plath's narrator, increasingly unable to inhabit the personality she has tried to assume, comes to resent her fashionable clothes, which take on a 'separate, mulish identity'. One night she throws them off the roof of her hotel in Manhattan, starting with 'a strapless elasticised slip which, in the course of wear, had lost its elasticity'. Waving it 'like a flag of truce' she lets it flutter off across the New York skyline, bearing with it in the precision of description, some of the false promise of Fifties push-up, long-line femininity. Neither Plath nor Woolf, though ambivalent about high fashion, ever seemed to worry that an interest in clothes would trivialise them. Feminism has occasionally taken that point of view but it has never prevailed. Mrs Pankhurst encouraged her supporters to dress smartly if discreetly, realising that slovenliness is next to sluttishness in the public mind and would make them and their cause more vulnerable. Women are taken more seriously if they obviously take care of their appearance. So why should men have felt obliged to profess such indifference to dress in the last century? One explanation offered by historians is the emergence of 'homosexuality' as a supposedly discrete syndrome. The trial of Oscar Wilde is cited, most recently by Christopher Breward, as a turning point after which any deviation in male clothes was seen as simply deviant. Like the French Revolution argument, this is surely only a partial truth. For whatever reason, however, it is true that the average heterosexual man, once he hits middle age, becomes wary of expressing an interest in clothes, his own or anyone else's. He is not unaware of them, merely inarticulate. There are certain key garments - dinner jacket, shell suit, cardigan - on which he will know at once where he stands. But when he wants to project his physical identity on the world, drop designer names and spend thousands of pounds on useless accessories, he does it with a car. His role in the insider-out world of fashion where women and homosexuals (and, since the late Fifties, the young) are in apparent charge, is oblique. It is sometimes suggested that fashion is either something inflicted by men on women or that it is engaged in by women for the benefit of men. Neither is usually true, nor do the proponents of such ideas fall into predictable political camps. Joan Smith, quoted by Watt, blows John Berger's famous dictum that 'men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at' smartly out of the water as just another male fantasy. If they are interested in clothes, women look at other women, because their clothes are more interesting. It might be truer to say that fashionable women's clothes were, for most of the century, the area in which certain aesthetic and social ideas concerning both sexes found their expression. De la Haye and Mendes offer a thorough if unadventurous account of what these have been. Baudot, who does not have to fit into a series format, goes further in making links with other art forms. Occasionally his unblushing Gallic conviction that nothing of any importance ever happened outside Paris stretches credulity. Swinging London cannot be entirely dismissed as an 'eccentricity that coincided with the loss of empire', but like de la Haye and Mendes he writes with clarity and authority about broader events. Two world wars, the disappearance of domestic staff, Constructivism, contraception and the Ballets Russes all have a part to play. However, the myth that hemlines fell in 1929 because of the Wall Street Crash is not allowed to stand. The collections, de la Haye and Mendes point out, had already been designed before it happened, fashion in this instance being more forward-thinking than finance. The question of what is cause and what effect, of who is influencing whom - men or women, designers or consumers, world affairs or waistlines - is a recurring theme. If historians sometimes simplify connections between fashion and other cultural trends they do at least provide an antidote to the megalomania of designers, who often think the opposite is true, that history actually follows fashion. 'Lucille', the nom de salon of the couturiere Lady Duff Gordon, was convinced that the short skirts and clean, liberated lines of interwar styles were entirely a product of the fashion houses' need to economise. 'Critics wrote learnedly of the \"modern girl's emancipation\",' she noted contemptuously. 'But neither the \"modern girl\" nor her critics knew she was a creation of . . . the rue de la Paix!' Such claims, like Poiret's, must, as de la Haye and Mendes say, be treated with caution, but not incredulity. Paris couture, which dominated fashion for the first half of the century, was taken seriously far beyond the salons. Both Sam Goldwyn and Adolf Hitler tried to manipulate it - Hitler tried to attract the couturiers to Berlin. Neither got what they wanted. Hitler, of course, like Mussolini, who actively set out to found an Italian fashion industry to compete with the French, was associated with some of the most stylised and stylish garments of the century. The SS uniforms were the epitome of male fear of fashion, all elements of personal expression denied and sublimated to the point of fetishism. From the Forties onwards overtly fashionable male dress was by definition anti-authoritarian or counter-cultural. In 1943 the 'zoot-suit' riots in Harlem, in which young Malcolm X took part, set a fashion for the Parisian 'zazous', men whose clothes marked them out as jazz fans and passive defiers of the German Occupation. It was in the interwar years that, in Europe at least, women dominated fashion as designers. Chanel, Vionnet and Schiaparelli created clothes intended (whatever Lucille thought) to liberate women and to feel as good on the body as they looked to the eye. If Watt's anthology has a fault - apart from a shocking number of transposed lines - it is the absence of E.M.Delafield, whose 'Diary of a Provincial Lady' appeared throughout the Thirties in Time and Tide, making brilliant cartoon-like use of clothes. Her description of an artistic party in Little James Street is worth a chapter of socio-historical analysis of the interwar gar\u008donne: 'Emma - in green sacque that looks exactly like demode window-curtain, sandals and varnished toe-nails . . . Am struck by presence of many pairs of horn-rimmed spectacles and marked absence of evening dress . . . Strange man enters into conversation with me . . . (Query: Who was Sappho and what was Isle of Lesbos?)' Watt does include part of Muriel Spark's The Girls of Slender Means set in the May of Teck, a women's club, during the Blitz. For special occasions the girls share a taffeta evening dress by Schiaparelli, its warm colours and panniered hips setting off each wearer slightly differently. Spark shows how the eroticism of clothes goes way beyond wearing a dress to attract a man, allowing the reader to observe, as the girls themselves do not, that the sharing of the dress is in itself exciting to men. After the war the range of garments available to women expanded hugely, while those acceptable to men who did not want to make a spectacle of themselves continued to dwindle until the Sixties. Plus-fours, spats, hats and even waistcoats largely disappeared. The tie was almost the only thing left that allowed a degree of personal expression without attracting suspicions of camp. Watt includes Alan Jenkins's touching elegy for his father, whom he conjures up through the ties he wore and which Jenkins remembers borrowing down to the last - 'a sort of crepe he bought for funerals, and hated'. As Breward argues was the case for the 19th century, so today the vocabulary of conventional male dress, though limited - almost covert - is precise and meaningful. A tie is still enough to mark one male out to another and provoke a clash of antlers. One of Watt's best passages is from Joe Orton's diary for 22 July 1967. Went to Peter Willes for dinner. When we got there he stared at Kenneth in horror. 'That's an old Etonian tie!' he screeched. 'Yes,' Kenneth said, 'it's a joke.' Willes looked staggered . . . 'Well, I'm afraid it's a joke against you then. People will imagine you're passing yourself off as an old Etonian.' 'I'm sending up Eton,' Kenneth said. 'Oh, no!' Willes cackled . . . 'You're just pathetic! . . . People will know.' 'Not the people I meet,' Kenneth said. 'They'll think it's funny.' Willes said . . . 'People dislike you enough already . . . it's permissible . . . as a foible of youth, but you - a middle-aged nonentity - it's sad.' 'Irony', the most prized fashion accessory of the late 20th century is, as poor Kenneth Halliwell discovered, a fragile thing, entirely dependent on context. His tie was funny when he left home but all the humour evaporated when he got to Willes's. Whether a clothes joke is on the wearer or the world is another of the tricky demarcation lines in dress.

      "bodyText": "General Augusto Pinochet is, according to a panel of medics, unfit to stand trial in Spain, where he faces charges of torture and murder. So the home secretary is now \"minded\" to halt extradition proceedings against the old dictator, and instead pack him off home to Chile. Jack Straw's choice of words reveals a man of few views and little principle. He does not \"intend\" or \"believe\". Instead, he is \"minded\". Ordinary people and politicians rarely use such pompous legalese, except when they are slinking away from difficult decisions. Straw has a good deal of form in the matter of retreating from awkward issues, freedom of information and the rights of asylum-seekers being the most egregious examples. Now, in his desperate campaign to assuage the Daily Mail-reading classes, he has found a way out of the Pinochet dilemma. And it is a dilemma, genuinely enough. Forget all the guff about him being a doddering old buffer, scarcely able to remember what he had for breakfast. Whatever his state of decrepitude, he deserves not a scrap of our sympathy. He was, and remains, a fascist brute with buckets of blood on his hands. The real issue is whether it was right for this country to take belated action against him. Many Chileans and others who know and admire that country are appalled that the prosecution of the old despot should take place anywhere but Santiago, where he presided over his squalid regime. That is a valid point. Against it is the narrow legal fact that his extradition was demanded by Spain, our European partner, and the much broader case that international crimes demand an international response. The last century was politically and diplomatically dominated by outmoded and inadequate theories of absolute sovereignty. We were brought up to believe that national laws and borders must be respected at almost all costs. In the past few years, that notion has belatedly begun to give way to a new sense of international interdependence, of which the arrest of Pinochet 15 months ago was a small, but sensational example. Since then, a debate has raged about double standards and hypocrisy. Siren voices, urging Pinochet's release, argued that since we could not take action against all the tyrants of the world, we should not pick on just one, and a retired one at that. To be sure, there are plenty of mass murderers in charge of world capitals, and we still receive their ambassadors and sell them guns. But the argument is double-edged: if Pinochet is held to be above prosecution, by definition we must extend the same immunity to every other jumped-up general who seizes power and kills his fellow citizens. In the end, disgracefully, the old brute is to escape justice not because any great principle is involved, but because our home secretary has found a way to wriggle out of yet another tough decision. Pinochet will be delivered to his air force jet and will no doubt be received with some pomp in his own country where, quite soon, he will die comfortably. Some will mourn him as a patriot, and others will curse him as a mass killer. What's more, he will be remembered in history a great deal longer than Jack Straw.

      "body": "<p>When it comes to Ali G there is one, and probably only one, thing on which just about everybody agrees: he is very funny. His racial identity may be unclear. Views over whom his jokes are directed at may differ. And the jury may be out on whether he is reinforcing or subverting stereotypes. But he makes you laugh. He makes you recite his lines and then laugh as though adulthood never happened and with an intensity you cannot quite explain. Ask people why they find him so funny and they will hide behind truisms. \"Ali G is what he is,\" they say. \"He speaks for himself.\" \"He is no more complicated than that.\"</p> <p>The idea that a white, Jewish man, Sacha Baron Cohen, could impersonate an ignorant, black misogynist who interrogates the rich, famous and influential, and not run into complications is an intriguing notion in itself. The most amazing thing about the litany of black comedians who branded Ali G \"racist\" and \"offensive\" earlier this week is that they took so long to come forward. Their detractors, however, have been quicker off the mark. Within 24 hours Jonathan Margolis was using Ali G as a Trojan horse to resurrect old-school racists like Bernard Manning. \"What people like Lenny Henry, Meera Syal, Sacha Baron Cohen and even Manning on a good day demonstrate, is that if comedy's racial stereotyping has a basis in accuracy, it rocks,\" he wrote in the Evening Standard yesterday.</p> <p>The debate will, hopefully, continue, and in so doing it will illustrate precisely why Ali G has been so successful. Like the racial equivalent of a gender-bender, he stands on a precipice. On the one side is the relatively steady ground of alternative comedy; on the other is the sheer drop in to racist buffoonery. It is an awkward place to be, not least because he finds himself at the epicentre of an awkward debate. But, so long as he can keep his balance, he will remain above the fray, if not beyond reproach. Move too far inland and he will be predictable and worthy; stray too close to the edge and he might topple over and land in the lap of Jim Davidson or the black and white minstrels.</p> <p>Baron Cohen does not give interviews himself and so we are left guessing - the first guess of many - which way if any he might fall. So he perches on the edge, leaving the key questions of \"What are we laughing at\" \"Whom are we laughing at\" and \"Whom are we laughing with\" either unanswered or with contradictory responses.</p> <p>For those who are already reaching for their set texts on \"political correctness\", please turn the page now. Those two words - which are used to lambast everyone from non-smokers to apartheid apologists - have stifled precisely the kind of fruitful discussion on issues such as race and humour for the best part of a decade. No one is suggesting the black experience in this country is out of bounds for comedians - be they black or white.</p> <p>But the idea that we should never draw an ethical line between what is acceptable and what is offensive when it comes to comedy is as disingenuous as it is bankrupt. We can argue about where we should draw the line on certain jokes, but there is little argument as to whether we should draw one at all. We do not broadcast jokes about paedophiles, Holocaust survivors or the mentally disabled because there is a general, popular view that those people are not fair game. Black people were once considered absolutely fair game simply because they existed. In the mid-70s, the sitcom Love Thy Neighbour fed off a regular diet of jokes about \"honkies\" and \"nig-nogs\". Such jokes would not be acceptable now. And in 20 years' time, we might watch Ali G or Goodness Gracious Me and wince. The line is blurred and it keeps on moving. That is what is so impressive about Ali G. The debate he has sparked is forcing us to consider redrawing the line.</p> <p>At its most basic level, it's not difficult to grasp what we are laughing at when we watch Ali G. Like Dennis Pennis, Mrs Merton and Dame Edna Everage before him, Ali G is the voice of spoof. He picks out members of the establishment, asks them stupid questions for which there is no sensible answer, and then watches them dissolve into a pit of their own pomposity. \"Why was Diana knobbing that Pakistani?\" he asks royal-watcher James Whittaker; \"What about marrying a Catholic girl?\" he says to George Patton, the grandmaster of the Orange Order in the north of Ireland. \"Possibly because of my faith I would not,\" replies Patton. \"But what if she was fit?\" asks Ali G. \"What if she had her own car and sound system and wasn't gonna be stealing money off you all the time?\" He is breaking taboos and ridiculing vanity. The less his interviewee gets the joke, the funnier the joke is.</p> <p>But that is not all we were laughing at. This would not be funny if Ali G was played by a black character. Part of the joke with the likes of Dennis Pennis and Mrs Merton is that they had to adopt a special persona which had nothing to do with the real-life actors. Pennis was an orange-haired geek; Mrs Merton was a nosy old lady; Dame Edna was a saucy, antipodean gossip queen. Because we knew who they were, we knew where they were coming from. The first problem with Ali G is that nobody really knows who, or rather what, he is supposed to be. The most common assumptions I have heard is that Baron Cohen is playing a black man, a white man trying to be black, or an Asian man trying to be black. Among the rank outsiders are that he is Turkish, Greek and Middle Eastern. After I wrote a piece assuming he was supposed to be white, one reader wrote an impassioned letter insisting: \"Ali G is ASIAN. That's half the joke; Asian guys trying to be cool like black guys.\"</p> <p>Those who have not read profiles of Baron Cohen are equally uncertain of the actor's own racial identity. He covers his hair with a Tommy Hilfiger head band and often hides his face behind ringed fingers. Guesses range from mixed-race and Asian to caucasian and any number of variations in between. \"He's not white, he's Jewish,\" said one acquaintance at a dinner party.</p> <p>Herein lies an understandable source of tension. We do not exactly know everything that we are laughing at. Ali G works on so many different levels that you can have two different people watching the same video and laughing at completely different things. One might be finding it funny the way this white comedian is poking fun at white people who overdo their impression of black youth culture. This is the most commonly held view, which casts Ali G as an exaggerated version of Tim Westwood, the popular, white Radio1 DJ who has feigned a black street accent for his hip hop slot.</p> <p>With black styles at the core of British youth culture, it is argued that Ali G is not poking fun at black people at all but \"wiggers\" - whites who want to be, or even think they are, black. As such, the argument goes, it reflects a sense of racial ease among younger generations of Britons, who all speak the same language, wear similar clothes and listen to similar music. It is a joke which could not exist without our lives being racially entwined. When Ali G asks Sir Rhodes Boyson whether he thinks children should be \"caned\" in school the joke is generational, not racial. Most over-40s think he is talking about corporal punishment; most under-40s know he is talking about drugs.</p> <p>But it is equally possible that somebody else might be laughing at his rendition of what stupid, sexist, drug-taking layabouts black men are. It is not as though these stereotypes are not out there and waiting to be exploited. Imagine the tables were turned and a black comedian created a white, Jewish character who made jokes about being a tightfisted, highly ambitious mummy's boy. Would it ever get screened? And if it did, would it be offensive?</p> <p>The difference between just these two interpretations - and there are many more - of what Ali G is about is crucial. Is he a white man impersonating a black man or a white man impersonating a white man impersonating a black man? One could reasonably be interpreted as a joke on the black community which conveys black male culture as misogynistic and ignorant; the other is a joke on that section of the white community who over-identify with black culture and make themselves look ridiculous in the process. One feeds a long-established prejudice against a minority; the other highlights a relatively recent phenomenon among a majority.</p> <p>The truth is that nobody knows. Baron Cohen is wise not to talk about his work, since to pontificate would be to take all the mystery from his character. His silence leaves us with many an unanswered question. But whatever his intention, he could not control how it is interpreted anyway. In some parts of the country his catchline, \"Is it because I is black?\", might be just one more surreal jingle for the playground; elsewhere it might be a line that bigots use to taunt someone who has complained about racial discrimination.</p> <p>The issue is not whether we should be laughing at Ali G or not; we are. Even the black comedians who said he was offensive admit that he makes them laugh. Nor is the question whether some people should be uneasy at Ali G; they are. In such a nebulous, subjective and sensitive area the true mark of our racial sophistication will be whether we can have an intelligent discussion about what makes us laugh and what makes us uneasy.</p> <p><b>What they make of Ali G in Staines</b></p> <p><b>Luke Thompson, 17 </b></p> <p>He's funny, the way he talks and that.

      "bodyText": "Cabinet ministers are embroiled in one of the biggest internal disputes since Labour came to power, over a proposal to lift restrictions on arms sales to Pakistan, according to leaked cabinet office papers. Minutes from a cabinet office meeting last month reveal that the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, are pressing for an end to a freeze on 80 arms exports licences imposed after last October's military coup. But the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and the international development secretary, Clare Short, are implacably opposed and still committed to the principle of an \"ethical foreign policy\". Mr Cook led the campaign to have Pakistan suspended from almost every Commonwealth body following the coup. The whole arms issue is one of the most emotive facing Labour ministers and MPs, exposing the faultline between support for the defence industry and support for democratic government and genuine aid projects. \"If we lose this, it will be Indonesia next, and Nigeria after that,\" said a junior minister opposed to arms sales to Pakistan being fully restored. \"This is the filthy end of foreign policy.\" Downing Street will have to adjudicate, though the minister said Tony Blair's track record had been poor on arms, tending to side with the powerful DTI and the ministry of defence axis. The arms issue will gain urgency with the expected arrival tomorrow of the British defence chief, Sir Charles Guthrie, in Pakistan to meet the new leader, General Pervez Musharraf, for the first high-level talks between the two countries since the coup. A US delegation arrives the same day. Although no arms embargo was formally imposed by Britain, the foreign office confirmed yesterday that no new applications for export licences had been approved since the coup. The leaked minutes disclose that senior civil servants from the DTI, MoD, foreign office, department of international development, treasury and customs and excise met at the cabinet office on December 8. The minutes, dated the following day, record that \"as part of our initial response to the October coup, the government decided to keep all current arms export applications for Pakistan under review until the situation becomes clearer. As a result, there are something like 80 pending applications and exporters are becoming increasingly impatient and suspicious.\" The minutes note: \"EU partners seem to be doing business as usual and show no signs of wanting to contemplate an arms embargo.\" Crucially, they add: \"MoD and DTI, therefore, wish to expedite the consideration of these applications in the normal way. FO and Dfid will consult their ministers and report back.\" More cabinet papers show that Mr Cook \"agreed strongly\" that there should be no return to the normal flow of military hardware until Pakistan provided firm commitments. Another said Ms Short was \"strongly opposed to the Whitehall consensus in favour of processing outstanding export licence applications to Pakistan. The secretary of state's [Ms Short's] view is that it is outrageous to consider arms exports before the International Monetary Fund programme and aid have been re-engaged.\" The IMF and World Bank suspended all transactions after the coup and said they would not resume talks until democracy was restored.

      "byline": "Janine Gibson, Media Correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The UK's first radio station devoted to sports coverage will rise from the ashes of Talk Radio next week when it relaunches as Talk Sport. </p> <p>Promising sports news, commentary and interviews, the station will signal a fresh round of bidding wars in the aggressive world of sports rights auctions and step up the competition between Talk and the BBC's Radio 5 Live. The commercial station has already poached several sporting events from the BBC, including England's current winter cricket tour. </p> <p>Talk's chief executive, Kelvin MacKenzie, was joined by the England football coach, Kevin Keegan, to announce the move yesterday. Mr Keegan, who heartily endorsed the station, has been asked to present a number of programmes for Talk Sport in the run-up to the Euro 2000 championship. </p> <p>Taking a swipe against his rival, Mr MacKenzie explained that it would be hard for him to buy sports rights and compete against \"the taxpayers' money\" that funds the BBC, but he confirmed that he would bid against 5 Live's greatest asset - its exclusive Premier League football deal, which was signed last year for \u00a35m and continues until 2001. </p> <p>He added that he was \"looking around\" for other sports rights. Talk's parent company, the Wireless Group, has received extra investment from shareholders including Rupert Murdoch. </p> <p>In the short term, Talk Sport will have to launch with a far smaller sports portfolio than its BBC rival. It shares FA Cup coverage with 5 Live and has the rights to England football internationals, Manchester United's European Champions League games and FA Cup matches. In rugby, it owns the British Lions rugby tours in 2001 and 2005 to New Zealand and Australia and the Tri-nations tournaments between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. During the afternoons, the station will cover European PGA golf matches and horse racing. </p> <p>A four-hour sports breakfast show presented by Gary Newbon will kick off the new schedule, followed by a mid-morning sports talk show. Per sonalities and commentators who will make up the presenters include the ex-footballer Alan Brazil, cricket experts Mark Nicholas and Geoff Boycott, and the racing commentator Brough Scott. The only non-sport output will be a motoring show at lunchtime and through-the-night phone-ins. </p> <p>Mr MacKenzie, who led a consortium to buy the five-year-old station last year and immediately began its transformation to a tabloid sports service, would not confirm which of Talk's existing presenters would be sacked, saying some had still not been told of the change to full-time sport. </p> <p>Industry observers said that the move to sport was no guarantee of higher ratings for the station.

      "bodyText": "The UK's first radio station devoted to sports coverage will rise from the ashes of Talk Radio next week when it relaunches as Talk Sport. Promising sports news, commentary and interviews, the station will signal a fresh round of bidding wars in the aggressive world of sports rights auctions and step up the competition between Talk and the BBC's Radio 5 Live. The commercial station has already poached several sporting events from the BBC, including England's current winter cricket tour. Talk's chief executive, Kelvin MacKenzie, was joined by the England football coach, Kevin Keegan, to announce the move yesterday. Mr Keegan, who heartily endorsed the station, has been asked to present a number of programmes for Talk Sport in the run-up to the Euro 2000 championship. Taking a swipe against his rival, Mr MacKenzie explained that it would be hard for him to buy sports rights and compete against \"the taxpayers' money\" that funds the BBC, but he confirmed that he would bid against 5 Live's greatest asset - its exclusive Premier League football deal, which was signed last year for \u00a35m and continues until 2001. He added that he was \"looking around\" for other sports rights. Talk's parent company, the Wireless Group, has received extra investment from shareholders including Rupert Murdoch. In the short term, Talk Sport will have to launch with a far smaller sports portfolio than its BBC rival. It shares FA Cup coverage with 5 Live and has the rights to England football internationals, Manchester United's European Champions League games and FA Cup matches. In rugby, it owns the British Lions rugby tours in 2001 and 2005 to New Zealand and Australia and the Tri-nations tournaments between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. During the afternoons, the station will cover European PGA golf matches and horse racing. A four-hour sports breakfast show presented by Gary Newbon will kick off the new schedule, followed by a mid-morning sports talk show. Per sonalities and commentators who will make up the presenters include the ex-footballer Alan Brazil, cricket experts Mark Nicholas and Geoff Boycott, and the racing commentator Brough Scott. The only non-sport output will be a motoring show at lunchtime and through-the-night phone-ins. Mr MacKenzie, who led a consortium to buy the five-year-old station last year and immediately began its transformation to a tabloid sports service, would not confirm which of Talk's existing presenters would be sacked, saying some had still not been told of the change to full-time sport. Industry observers said that the move to sport was no guarantee of higher ratings for the station. Audience figures released by the ratings organisation Rajar in November revealed that Talk had suffered a 17% fall in audience to 1.8m, as its listenership adjusted to the sports-based chat and older women deserted the station. Radio 5 Live has a weekly audience of around 5.5m. Radio 5 Live questioned whether Talk Radio's portfolio of sports rights would be sufficient to fill a rolling sports station.",

      "body": "<p>Aspen and Saffron Drewitt-Barlow, the twins fathered by two gay Essex millionaires, could be luckier than they know. For the first ever study of gay dads in Britain suggests that gay men are more committed to caring for their children, and get on better with their children's mothers, than many straight ones. </p> <p>Barrie Drewitt, 32, and Tony Barlow, 35, last month won the right from the US supreme court to be officially recognised as \"parent 1\" and \"parent 2\" of their five-week-old boy and girl twins. Becoming fathers cost them an estimated \u00a3200,000 over four years in expenses and legal fees before they eventually succeeded, using their own sperm, a donor egg and an American surrogate mother. Home office officials will rule early next month on whether Aspen and Saffron, who were recently granted temporary entry to Britain, will be allowed to stay. </p> <p>Before they decide, they may want to look at evidence collated by Dr Gill Dunne, senior research fellow in the gender institute of the London School of Economics. She has produced a study based on interviews with 100 gay fathers and would-be fathers, to be published shortly by the economic and social research council. It suggests not only that gay fathers may be positively choosing to have children and to look after them, but also that their family relationships could be a model for the future. </p> <p>The experiences of the fathers who contacted Dunne, mostly via email, varied enormously. Some had \"come out\" as gay, having already fathered children in a heterosexual marriage. Of these, some remained married, while others were divorced but still looked after their children. Some were fostering or adopting children: these foster fathers often had a background in social work, and had been fostering for between eight and 25 years. Younger men in particular were more likely to have children by donating sperm to lesbian couples. They found these mothers either because they were already friends, or through advertisements. </p> <p>There were also a few men who, like the Essex couple, used surrogates. Sometimes this was done commercially in US states where surrogacy is legal. Others found volunteer surrogates: one man adopted the baby granddaughter of a lesbian friend, while another's sister agreed to carry and hand over a child created with her egg and the sperm of his male partner. </p> <p>If the conception arrangements were complicated, so too were some of the family homes. Several men lived in families that included their male partner as well as their own wife or ex-wife, and the children. One father lived with two heterosexual women and all their children. One gay man and heterosexual woman with fertility problems have moved in together temporarily so they can have IVF but, once they are parents, plan to live separately, possibly with their own lovers, in the same block of flats or in the same street. </p> <p>In several cases, the homes were organised around the children - part of a consistent commitment to childcare which saw a quarter of Dunne's sample fathers working under 30 hours a week, and quite a few giving up paid work entirely to be the main carer. One gay man and his ex-wife practised \"nesting\": their child stayed in the same home all the time, while they took it in turns to spend half the week in the house with her. </p> <p>Where gay fathers donated sperm or used surrogates, they tended to spend a long time working out the arrangements for looking after their children, says Dunne. If they changed their minds, it was often because they discovered they wanted to be more involved as parents than they had expected. One Bristol man, for example, fathered a child for a lesbian couple in Brighton. He had anticipated being a \"kindly uncle\", visiting every few months. Instead, she says, \"he found he liked being a father so much that he asked one of the women to have another child for him. He will give up work and move to Brighton when the child is born, so it can be breastfed, then will take it back to Bristol to live with him.\" </p> <p>Men who came out as gay within a heterosexual marriage often faced initial anger and hostility from their families. One man had cards he had sent to his children returned: where he had signed \"Dad\", his daughter had added \"biological only\". But even then, says Dunne, the vast majority re-established good relationships. Several men said their ex-wives were their best friends. Almost none had lost contact with their children; many took part in daily childcare or looked after their children at least two days and nights a week. </p> <p>This positive picture may be because the study sample was self-selecting. It may also be partly because these men's marriages were based more on friendship than sexual attraction in the first place, suggests Dunne, and because their wives felt less undermined by their husband's \"new\" sexual orientation than they would have done if replaced with another woman. The fact remains that these gay dads contrast strongly with most British fathers, who work more hours, do less childcare, and half of whom - if they get divorced - lose all contact with their children within two years. </p> <p>That does not mean they were entirely happy. Many were lonely, finding it difficult to integrate into gay social circles - because they had children in tow - into toddler groups, where the other parents were women. Nevertheless, Dunne believes young gay men in Britain increasingly feel fatherhood is within their reach, to the extent of anticipating a \"gayby boom\". </p> <p>Fifteen men who hope soon to become fathers through sperm donation have agreed to keep diaries for her, she says. Most anticipate an active and happy fatherhood which will benefit not only their own children, but all of us: \"I think it will be lovely for children to grow up with lots of people to talk to, in families based on friendship,\" she says. \"Historically, we have grown up in extended families: the isolated nuclear family is a very short-lived phenomenon. These guys offer us some very interesting models about how men can be parents. They are men who are proud of being men, who are in the forefront of change. We can learn a lot from them.\"</p>",

Some have brilliantly imaginative printing options: you can collect postcards, print your own pictures to colour in, even write and print your own book. </p> <p>Our son's all-time favourite, which was not part of this survey, is Fireman Sam by the Productive Play Company. It's fantastically varied, it's funny and it's got fire engines in it. </p> <p>We found that to start with you need to sit with your child and help them find their way around each CD-rom's activities - otherwise you discover they've only been accessing half the options available. But it doesn't take long before they're more adept at it than you are. </p> <p>All the CD-roms tested below are available at leading/high street software retailers. </p> <p><strong> Great Adventures: Pirate Ship (Fisher-Price, \u00a319.99). Ages 3-7</strong> </p> <p>This was instantly appealing to a four-year-old boy obsessed with anything to do with pirates. Captain Stubbs has torn his treasure map into nine pieces and hidden them around his ship, but he's forgotten where he put them. Pongolo Pete the parrot, the captain's first mate, helps children search for the hidden fragments so they can find the treasure. Lots of games and activities - you can design flags, play with battle cannons, build a ship in a bottle, sing along to pirate shanties. Not massively educational, but very entertaining. Sometimes a bit hard tofind your way around. <strong> Rating: 7/10</strong> </p> <p><strong> Learning Ladder (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a319.99). Ages 3-5</strong> </p> <p>The cover looks daunting - it's described as The Complete Learning System For Your Child and supports the school curriculum. But it's good fun, very entertaining and highly educational. The activities are located in an attractive playroom which you can roam around with your guide, Woody, a talking pencil, who encourages you to click on games and exercises. Very good on nature, shapes, story sequences, numbers and letters. Some elements were disappointing (the puppet theatre could have been more imaginative, though perhaps we didn't get it working properly). But we went back to this one again and again - lots of stories and a lovely variety of voices and accents. <strong> Rating: 9/10</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Thomas and Friends: The Great Festival Adventure (Hasbro, \u00a319.99; call 0990 745745 for stockist information). Ages 2+</strong> </p> <p>With beautiful graphics, this is a lovely product altogether, although a bit limited for older children. It's festival day on the Island of Sodor, and the Fat Controller needs Thomas and his friends to get everything ready on time. Help unload packages from Bulstrode the Barge, build fairground rides, help Harold the Helicopter clear a rockfall at the quarry and clean and fix the engines. Good on basic colour matching, counting and shape sorting, this will go down fantastically well with Thomas fans. <strong> Rating: 8/10</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Getting Ready for School (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a319.99). Ages 3-5</strong> </p> <p>Again, this is a really appealing product. Lovely graphics and sounds, and it's very easy to use, with an excellent guide for parents and adjustable levels of difficulty. You're shown around six different games by a jack-in-the-box called Zak, who speaks in rhyming couplets. It's very straightforward, and good for early work on letters and counting - we particularly liked the helicopter which made letter shapes in the sky and the truck which dumped and picked up sand. Not a barrel of laughs, but useful. <strong> Rating: 7/10</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Bananas in Pyjamas: It's Party Time (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a319.99). Ages 2-6</strong> </p> <p> Spin-off from the TV show, featuring two bananas called B1 and B2, giggling teddy bears and a rat in a hat. Funny if you're under five, a bit wearing for grown-ups. Children will like the party theme and there are fun games. We enjoyed chasing teddies and making them do Hawaiian dances but it was a quick laugh, not lasting entertainment. The cover boasts \"bonus paint and print activities\" which we didn't stay to find. Not one we went back to again and again. Easy to find your way around, but not as interactive as others. It's designed for ages 2 to 6, but better suited to younger children. <strong> Rating: 6/10</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Reader Rabbit's Junior (The Learning Company, \u00a319.99). Ages 4-6</strong> </p> <p>Set in a campsite inhabited by Mattie the mouse, Charlie the chipmunk and Spike the naughty porcupine, this CD-rom went down very well indeed. There's a clear educational focus, with games such as Number Lumber, Canoe Match, Camp Clock and Counting Lake, but it's good fun, too. We particularly liked the camp library, where you can make up your own picture story and then print it out. Some of the voices were slightly difficult to understand, but on the whole it was very engaging and challenging. <strong> Rating: 8/10</strong></p>",

But Lucy and her three-year-old sister Carly nevertheless spent nine months on the child protection register: \"I still feel angry and frustrated because no one listened to what we had to say.

      "bodyText": "Any opposition to Straw's decision will be blind opposition The problem is that the doctors' report is secret. This means it is not possible, for instance, for Spanish forensic doctors to examine these findings and reach their own conclusions. It seems that the British home office realised how hard it would be [for the Spanish prosecutors] to make a representation without the details of the diagnosis. This is why the home office sought\u0085 authorisation to hand a copy of the report to the Spanish authorities. But Pinochet rejected the proposal. As such, the representations invited by the home office will be of a somewhat metaphysical nature. Any opposition to Straw's decision will be blind opposition, necessarily, and as such thoroughly unsound. El Pais, Spain A landmark in the defence of human rights The Pinochet case is a landmark in the defence of human rights. The progress made has not been simply rhetorical or notional. Even if the ex-dictator does now return to his country, some incontrovertible principles have been established. First, that treaties and conventions into which nations enter lightly are nonetheless binding; and second, that the protection of [human] rights requires a framework which is better defined than the individual actions of a Spanish magistrate. ABC, Spain 'Purely humanitarian grounds' By announcing its decision before the results of the Chilean election are known, the British government wants to give the impression that it has no political motive, and is acting on purely humanitarian grounds.

      "bodyText": "The health service is under \"serious\" pressure, Tony Blair told the Commons today, in a prime minister's question time dominated by the flu crisis. In the first question time clash of the new millennium, Mr Blair said that half of all intensive care beds were taken up by flu patients and the government acknowledged there were \"capacity constraints\". The prime minister got in a dig at the opposition, saying: \"The difference between this government and the previous government is that we recognise the constraints and we are tackling them.\" Tory leader William Hague said it was time for the government to \"wake up and recognise\" that the NHS was not coping because of ministers' failure to prepare for the crisis. \"Now you are another Labour prime minister who says: 'Crisis what crisis?'\" he told Mr Blair. Mr Hague said the number of people waiting to see a hospital consultant has risen sharply at the same time as the government had increased the number of political advisers. They were \"more interested in spin doctors than real doctors,\" he said. The prime minister accused the opposition leader of \"opportunistically\" trying to make political capital out of the problem. Tory MP Tim Loughton asked why the government's health service promises were not being felt in his constituency of East Worthing and Shoreham, an area of southern England with a higher than average number of pensioners. Mr Blair said that there were more beds this year than last and that waiting lists were 80,000 below the level they were under the last administration. However, he added that it took time to train doctors and nurses and that it would take time for the government reforms to filter through to the hospital wards. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy rounded on the government and asked whether in the light of the flu crisis Mr Blair's promises to save the NHS now looked \"very threadbare indeed\". Mr Blair said: \"We are putting in extra investment... it has to be done stage by stage, consistent with the running of a sound economy.\" In other questions, Mr Blair attacked English nationalism and told the Commons that he was sure that the thoughts of the whole house were with the families of the seven fishermen missing off the Isle of Man. \"Our profound sympathy is with them all,\" he said.",

The Times of July 7 1993 carried a feature by Gareth Williams QC, a former chairman of the bar, reviewing the report of the royal commission on criminal justice. \"The serious blemish in an otherwise admirable report,\" he wrote, \"is the proposal that in those cases where the accused can now opt for trial by jury, this right should be removed ...

It is a move that signals a radical shift in ecological thinking which argues that our existing nature reserves are failing to protect nature. </p> <p>The plan is the brainchild of Adrian Colston, manager of the trust's national nature reserve at Wicken Fen. He wants to buy 22 square miles of adjoining Cambridgeshire farmland and flood it. If it is approved, the new reserve would be nearly four times the size of the trust's recent Snowdon purchase. </p> <p>Colston argues: \"Small is no longer beautiful. Big is better. Conservationists are used to dealing with reserves of 35 acres, but they are too fragile. If a cow dungs in the wrong place or someone treads on the wrong spot, a rare animal or plant can be wiped out.\" </p> <p>Wicken is hardly small now. It is a glorious, 800-acre remnant of one of the first UK habitats to be almost completely destroyed - the great primeval fen that once extended 100 miles from Cambridge to beyond Lincoln. </p> <p>It was established a century ago and is celebrated as Britain's oldest nature reserve - and one of the best protected. Blessed with one of the largest species lists of any UK reserve - 212 different spiders, 1,000 moths and 1,700 flies - it is biodiversity writ large. Fauna and flora are so profuse that much remains unnamed, even though scientists have been studying the area since the early 19th century, when a young Charles Darwin was drawn there by a passion for beetles. </p> <p>Yet all is not well. Despite maximum legal protection and the best efforts of the trust, species are steadily disappearing. A bleak catalogue of losses includes five out of 19 dragonflies, four of Darwin's beetles, water vole, Montagu's harrier, marsh warbler, short-eared owl and 35 flowering plants. A fifth beetle is in jeopardy, and the list grows longer year by the year. </p> <p>The problem is that it is an island in a sea of hostile farmland - a difficulty faced by many other reserves. The spectacular swallowtail butterfly, for which Wicken was once famous, is a case in point. Now the only UK population survives on the Norfolk Broads, 60 miles away. With Wicken's surrounding fields producing five crops of lettuce a year and each crop typically sprayed five times with insecticide, the chances of the swallowtail re-establishing itself are remote. </p> <p>One of the paradoxes of British nature reserves is their dependence on unnatural human intervention. Centuries of farming and land drainage have left Wicken 12 feet higher than adjoining land. The reserve is only saved from drying out by a plastic membrane buried 12 feet deep, the length of a mile-long boundary. </p> <p>The membrane may be unique to Wicken, but hugely laborious tasks, such as clearing scrub and preventing sedge fen being overrun by woodland, are typical of work on other reserves. </p> <p>Colston believes that bigger reserves will make wildlife much more sustainable, and the reserves themselves much more natural. He aims to leave the control of vegetation to wild cattle and horses. The process of wildlife management will be reduced, and natural processes will be allowed to let rip. </p> <p>\"At present we manage Wicken for a very specific set of objectives,\" he says. \"But, having frozen everything in aspic, we're now being told climate change could cause all the interest to be lost. With a big area, things can change and we can be much less rigid.\" </p> <p> He is inspired by the Netherlands' Oostvardersplassen, a vast and fantastic landscape of reedbeds, marsh and open water that has drawn exceptional populations of rarities since its 22 square miles were flooded in the 1960s. \"What strikes you there is the sheer abundance of everything,\" Colston says. \"Things that were hanging on by their fingertips have become well established and sustainable.\" </p> <p>Wicken is not the only place where conservationists want to create wetlands. The World Wide Fund for Nature has funded a \u00a320,000 feasibility study to help the wildlife trusts create a second Cambridgeshire super-reserve at Whittlesey Mere, the last of the big fens. Peterborough museum keeps a sea eagle shot there in 1848. But drainage three years later left no place either for sea eagles or their once abundant prey, and is seen by one leading ecologist as one of the greatest environmental calamities ever to hit Britain. </p> <p>The wildlife trusts are also working with the Environment Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds to restore five square miles of arable desert at Longden Marsh, Worcestershire. </p> <p>\"If a country like the Netherlands, which is about the size of East Anglia, can do this, then so can we,\" says Derek Moore, the wildlife trusts' conservation director. \"You have to have a vision, and if we're really going to be serious about biodiversity and the recovery of vanishing species then we need to stop mucking around with little patches. </p> <p>\"We'll be able to bring back some of the species that have disappeared. Some, such as spoonbills and bitterns, could return naturally, but it also gives us the chance to reintroduce creatures like the beaver.\" </p> <p>Neither Colston nor Moore expects quick success: Colston is thinking in terms of 100 years; Moore reckons on 30-50 years for Whittlesey Mere. But they believe that circumstances are on their side. The value of fenland is un-likely to stay high because the peat which makes the fens so productive is vanishing, steadily destroyed by farming. </p> <p>Over the next 50 to 100 years, internationally protected nature reserves along the east coast are expected to be lost to rising seas, and government will be under pressure to find land to compensate. With increasing pressure on flood defences, which cost up to \u00a33m a mile, cost benefit analyses are unlikely to justify in perpetuity the use of taxpayers' money to protect land below sea level, such as that at Wicken and Whittlesey. </p> <p>Restoring fenland by letting water on to the land is the easy part, because wetlands develop remarkably fast.

But when economists have examined whether where people live is an important determinant of whether or not they are poor, they have failed to find any connection. Family characteristics - such as parents' income and education - are much more important in determining whether children grow up poor. </p> <p>Some policymakers suggest that concentrated deprivation cuts people off from mainstream society - in the government's jargon, they are the \"socially excluded\" - the job, health, housing and income poor.

As unemployment has fallen to 30-year lows in the US and 20-year lows in the UK, unemployment among even the most disadvantaged groups has shrunk. While unemployment rates among ethnic minorities, young people and unskilled workers remain higher, the most important determinant of whether or not they find a job is the state of the overall economy. </p> <p>Kleinman says national policies on education, employment, housing, social security and families will have far more impact on the life chances of people living in the poorest areas than local policies. The working families tax credit has already begun redistributing income to those at the bottom of the pile. </p> <p>If national policies are more important than local initiatives, is there any role at all for area-based policies?

Improving access to government services, which are worst in the most deprived areas, ought to be a priority for its own sake. </p> <p>But perhaps the most useful idea to come out of the proliferation of zones may be the importance of local particpation in decision making. It is one of the paradoxes of the poverty debate that while in the development world, a consensus is emerging among official donors and NGOs that the best anti-poverty programmes are those developed in conjunction with the poor themselves, this is not a lesson many western governments have applied at home.</p>",

It is one of the paradoxes of the poverty debate that while in the development world, a consensus is emerging among official donors and NGOs that the best anti-poverty programmes are those developed in conjunction with the poor themselves, this is not a lesson many western governments have applied at home.",

Latest customs figures show that this benefited local government to the tune of \u00a33.3bn in 1998/99.</p> <p> But when councils get involved in spending other money, such as lottery grants,they have another set of rules allowing it to reclaim VAT on these activities too, providing the total reclaimed does not go over 5% of the council's total VAT bill.

As its name suggests, the service is akin to legal aid: it offers free advice to individuals and community groups who otherwise could not afford professional help with planning applications, hearings and tribunals. </p> <p>Planning Aid assigned a volunteer, Andrew Ford, to the case.

It makes all of us, as well as our children and grandchildren, a walking experiment - one with completely unknown results.\" </p> <p>But John Peterson, director of the W. Alton Jones Foundation in the US, was not trying to frighten his audience. He was talking last month in Japan to a group of international scientists, already deeply concerned about the issue of chemical contamination of the human body. They agreed that the major danger seems to be hormone dis ruption, and that the most vulnerable group are as yet unborn children. Peterson said: \"No mother anywhere on earth does not carry some of these compounds in her body.\" </p> <p>When this first became an issue five years ago, research was concerned with what were dubbed \"gender-benders\" - chemicals capable of causing sex changes in fish and other animals exposed to them, otherwise known as endocrine disrupters. Was this the cause of low sperm counts in men, the increase in testicular cancer and male sex organ deformities? But by the time of the Japanese meeting last month, it was clear that many scientists believe that endocrine disrupters affect all aspects of human development from the embryo onwards, and in much lower concentrations than were thought possible. </p> <p>The most disturbing research is on a substance called bisphenol A, a substance worth billions of pounds to the chemical industry. It is a building block of polycarbonate plastic, which means little until you realise that it is used for lining the inside of food cans - everything from baked beans to baby food. </p> <p>Independent scientists say that, in experiments, this substance had a powerful effect on the reproductive tract of mice at levels thousands of times below what was thought possible. The chemical industry denies it, saying it has conducted the same experiments but cannot get the same results. Much is at stake for shareholders if the substance is banned. </p> <p>Peterson was preaching to the converted in Japan. The 25 scientists gathered there were so concerned about the mass of new evidence before them that they demanded steps be taken to reduce the levels of the hundreds of untested chemicals in the environment. They were particularly anxious about organochlorines, used as pesticides in Britain on fruit and vegetables, because evidence already existed that they were harming wildlife. </p> <p>At the same time as these scientists were sounding the alarm, the UK government was deciding not to ban either organochlorines or their replacements in certain applications - the equally controversial organophosphates. Although some new restrictions are being placed on organophosphate sheep dip, it is still likely to be widely used this summer. </p> <p>The restrictions are on the type of container, after evidence that sheep farmers were badly affected if the concentrated form was spilt on the skin. The government has also finally agreed to investigate the 800-plus cases of people too crippled to work who blame exposure to sheep dip. </p> <p>The ministry of agriculture's reluctance to delve too deeply into this area, following the disaster of BSE, has long held up progress, but at last the government is beginning to move. </p> <p>Not so the European Union. After intense pressure before Christmas, some substances used as softening agents in plastic toys were banned. These were toys that children might suck, thereby ingesting hormone disrupting chemicals. </p> <p>After this single action, the EU issued a strategy to deal with \"substances which disrupt human and wildlife hormone systems\". But while the EU statement looks to \"identify appropriate policy action\" and use the \"precautionary principle\", little further action is proposed - apart from more research. </p> <p>Instead of compulsory action to cut the number of chemicals contaminating human blood the EU suggests \"voluntary initiatives\" to identify substitutes in order to eliminate or find replacements for substances of concern. </p> <p>This does not satisfy Peterson, the 25 scientists or the campaigners in this field. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said in a statement: \"The commission's strategy is a limp response to a major problem - no doubt at least in part due to industries' pleas for minimal disruption to business as usual, and to the lack of resources being made available. One of the main thrusts of the commission's strategy is to list priority chemicals, but it is still not clear that exposure to these will be controlled or eliminated. There is no clear strategy to investigate the bulk of chemicals to which we are exposed for their ability to disrupt endocrine systems.\" </p> <p>Gwynne Lyons, toxics and policy adviser to the WWF, said: \"The European Commission seems content to focus only on the tip of the iceberg, but there is a need for a far more robust strategy to protect man and the environment from these gender bending and mind numbing chemicals.\" </p> <p>Peterson has no doubts about the dangers either. \"We know now that while there can be acute health impacts on adults with high exposures, the most vital are low level exposures in the womb. These have lifelong, debilitating impacts that erode the very essence of what a young baby can aspire to as he or she grows and matures and becomes a functioning - or dysfunctional - adult in society. </p> <p>\"All this is happening fast, certainly more rapidly than advances in our understanding of what we have done or what risks we have created. And because the scale is now global, we have no place to hide from our mistakes. No human baby has been born for several decades without experiencing measurable contamination in the womb. These are experiments whose results we will not know until it's too late to call them off.\" </p> <p>But he and his colleagues in Japan urged politicians at least to stop the situation getting worse. As a minimum, they said, substances that accumulate in the human body and persist should be eliminated from products and commerce. </p> <p>Peterson also suggested a shift of burden of proof for endocrine disrupting chemicals, even those that are not bio-accumulative and persistent. Currently, science has to prove them dangerous before they can be banned. If tests showed a compound carried plausible risk, commercial use exposing vulnerable populations should not be allowed until the material is proven as safe to people, he argued.</p>",

I have to be home - which is 120 miles away - by 3pm, calling en route at the probation office and the pub. (The latter being de rigeur, you understand.) I must arrive home early to allow them time to come and install the unit in my home and fit the tag to me. They arrive at 11pm! The Home Monitoring Unit (HMU) looks like a cheap 1970s alarm clock, and the tag itself is like a big watch, minus the clockface. Fitted to my ankle, it is nicely discreet.

It's the Securicor monitoring centre in Manchester, asking if I am at home. Either the bath water obscured the signal, or I was out of range. They say they will send someone round to investigate. </p> <p><strong> Day 3</strong> : No one arrived yesterday to investigate my bath. I dusted the flat during the day and knocked the HMU, which promptly rang up and grassed on me, prompting a terse call from the monitoring centre. </p> <p><strong> Day 4</strong> : Securicor came to change my tag; the old one was from a faulty batch. They obviously aren't too sophisticated. There was talk in prison that they could sense alcohol and that you could be located by satellite at any time. </p> <p><strong> Day 6</strong> : Another visit - to change the tag again. </p> <p><strong> Day 9</strong> : Telephone call in the evening to check that I am in, and they ask me a security question: \"What's your middle name?\" </p> <p><strong> Day 13</strong> : Another visit - the HMU has reported that I'm out. Reliability doesn't seem to be a key feature. </p> <p><strong> Day 16</strong> : Visited by two new officers who change the HMU and the tag. The new HMU resembles digital kitchen scales, while the tag plays a tune if you knock it. After they have gone, while talking to a friend on the telephone, I am inter rupted by the HMU's female voice telling me to hang up. </p> <p><strong> Day 28</strong> : My first day in a part-time job working 9am to 5pm. The tag didn't present any problems. </p> <p><strong> Day 31</strong> : Armed robbery at the shop opposite my flat, and I am prevented from helping for fear of the tag amputating my ankle if I set foot outside the boundary. </p> <p><strong> Day 32</strong> : My partner's grandfather died, and I am passed from pillar to post and back again between the prison, Securicor and probation to try to vary my curfew hours to attend the funeral. </p> <p><strong> Day 33</strong> : Established that the decision lies with the prison governor.

Still numb with shock from the news, she organised the games and food for her son Ashley's third birthday, thinking the worst but not really knowing what was in store. The paediatric assessment unit that broke the news had sent her away with a leaflet and told her to return after the summer holidays. </p> <p>\"At the party,\" she recalls, \"I looked at the other children and thought, 'Why are they normal and he's not?' I felt like I was grieving for a child I'd lost - the one I thought he was going to be.\" </p> <p>Zoe, who lives in Sheffield, knew Ashley had a problem when he was just over a year old. \"At first, I thought he was deaf as he didn't react to things,\" she says. \"When he had tantrums, people would say he was just going through the 'terrible twos' early. But at 12 months old? I knew something was wrong.\" </p> <p>Like most people, Zoe's knowledge of autism came mostly from Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of an autistic man with a talent for maths in the film Rain Man. But people with autism can have a wide range of disabilities. It affects their social and communication skills, which means they have difficulty understanding the world and, therefore, interacting appropriately with it. </p> <p>After the news sunk in, Zoe demanded more help. Eventually, she was put in touch with an EarlyBird programme, then being piloted by the National Autistic Society (NAS) in south Yorkshire. The programme aims to teach parents of pre-school children diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder how to communicate more effectively with their children and to help them prevent the development of inappropriate behaviour as they grow older. </p> <p>The NAS wants more parents to benefit from EarlyBird and this month is rolling out the scheme nationally and offering training courses for staff to be trained in the techniques. Next week, the society is hosting a conference on different models of early intervention. </p> <p>The scheme has been evaluated by researchers from the University of Teesside, who found that parents were less stressed after completing the programme and saw their children as \"less autistic\". The parents reported that the programme provided \"light at the end of the tunnel\". </p> <p>Once a week, for three months, parents attend group training meetings or have home visits, where they are videoed interacting with their children and taught to apply what they learn in the group. Since the pilot, two more centres - in Wandsworth, south London, and in Leicestershire - have been licensed to use the EarlyBird model. </p> <p>Provision for under-fives diagnosed as autistic is patchy, says Dr Jane Shields, manager of the EarlyBird project. Many local authorities fail to provide specific services for this age group, while other programmes aimed at parents of young children are very intensive. EarlyBird is a more manageable scheme for parents, she claims, and relatively cheap for local authorities to run, once staff have been trained. </p> <p>\"We help them understand what is different for a child with autism,\" Shield says. \"We help them analyse the underlying causes of the inappropriate behaviour.\" </p> <p>This can mean teaching simple techniques such as how to cut down on the number of words parents use when talkingto their child. \"Parents are in danger of talking too much to a child,\" Shield explains. \"Even those children who have a wide vocabulary have difficulty processing the language. Parents found the most benefit in simplifying what they say and inserting pauses in between what they say. The parents often say it is a relief to find out their child isn't just naughty and doing it on purpose to annoy them. Once you understand why they are behaving that way, you can retrain your instincts in dealing with them.\" </p> <p>Just as important for Zoe Jerome was the support of other parents: \"Ashley had a thing about chewing carpets,\" she says. \"You could tell people at the group because they would say something like, 'That's OK, mine chews curtains.'\" </p> <p>The programme taught Zoe what lay behind Ashley's behaviour and provided techniques to help her manage it because, as Shields explains, parents need to be able to predict what might upset the child in order to head off confrontations. </p> <p>For example, Ashley has an aversion to strong colours, and Zoe discovered that a regular tantrum was triggered by the colour of the front door. \"Also, he doesn't like too many patterns, so I have to be careful with his clothes,\" she says. Avoiding all the triggers, Zoe jokes, \"means that my life is like a military operation\". </p> <p>Since undertaking the EarlyBird course, Zoe says her relationship with Ashley has improved no end. He now sleeps on his own and can ask for things when he needs them. \"The change is mainly to do with me,\" she says. \"I give him a lot more understanding and leeway.\" </p> <p>Paul Cann, chief executive of the NAS, believes that early diagnosis can save later heartache, but even when autism is detected early, help for pre-school children is not widely available. EarlyBird, he argues, can plug the gap. </p> <p>Sam Mondon was aged two when he was diagnosed with autism nearly seven years ago. His father, Alan, says they were desperate for help in the pre-school years. \"There was nothing around then,\" he says. \"My wife was driven to looking up autism in old medical books. One-to-one help would have made a huge difference then.\" </p> <p>\"The earlier you get there, the more you can do,\" says Cann. \"And it's not just autism. Many special needs go undetected for many years, the consequences of which can be disastrous. EarlyBird gets parents out of despair and helplessness to understand their children. We give them back their children.\" </p> <p>According to Zoe Jerome, the EarlyBird course means she no longer grieves for Ashley, now five. \"Now I think he can become a productive member of society,\" she says. \"I think he can achieve anything.\" </p> <p><em>For more information on the EarlyBird programme visit <a href=\"http://www.oneworld.org/autism_uk\">www.oneworld.org/autism_uk</a> or call the National Autistic Society's helpline on 0870-600 8585 (calls charged at local rates).

He is under a duty to act in a judicial capacity in deciding extradition cases. Like all suspects Gen Pinochet is presumed innocent and Mr Straw is under an obligation to free him if he is likely to die before he is tried.</p> <p>Critics of the government's handling of the Pinochet case - and there are many, from Lady Thatcher to Lord Lamont and a whole host of rightwing luminaries in between - will doubtless suggest that yesterday's decision is one that should have been taken 18 months ago.</p> <p>But the medical reports that landed on Mr Straw's desk this week are not the first he has seen relating to the 84-year-old general. When Gen Pinochet was first arrested in 1998 representations were made on behalf of the Chilean senator that his age and health would render it unjust or oppressive to issue an authority to proceed. In answer to a written question in the House of Commons Mr Straw replied that he had considered these carefully, but concluded that it did not appear that Gen Pinochet was unfit to stand to trial, and for him to do so would not be unjust or oppressive.</p> <p>But according to yesterday's statement Gen Pinochet's condition has deteriorated significantly in the past few months.</p> <p>It is ironic that he was in London receiving medical care when he was first arrested in October 1988. His back had gone into spasm during the 17-hour flight from Santiago, and he was in extreme discomfort when he was led from the Lufthansa jet straight into the Hounslow suite, one of four foreign office VIP rooms at Heathrow that are reserved for visiting dignitaries.</p> <p>Little did he know that his arrival in London would set in motion what will no doubt go down as one of the most controversial episodes in British, and international, legal history.</p> <p>A few weeks after his arrival, as he convalesced after back surgery in a London clinic, rumours began circulating that the Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon was preparing to request Gen Pinochet's detention. Less than a week later, still groggy in his hospital bed, he was arrested on charges of murder, torture and terrorism carried out under his 17 year military regime.</p> <p>His arrest stunned and divided the world. The case forced the international community - and the circumstances dictated that it was largely Britain's legal and political institutions to which the task fell - to examine how it could, would and should deal with those who transgress the norms of international behaviour.</p> <p>The legal challenge by Gen Pinochet's lawyers went all the way to the House of Lords where a panel of three law lords threw it out in December 1998, prompting Mr Straw to give his consent to the action proceeding. But the initial ruling was then set aside in an unprecedented move as Gen Pinochet's lawyers argued that links between one of the law lords, Lord Hoffmann, and the human rights group Amnesty International cast doubt on his impartiality.</p> <p>The issue then had to be re-examined by a new panel of law lords. They also decided that Gen Pinochet had no immunity as a former head of state, but they did decide he could only face trial on charges relating to incidents after Britain signed up to crucial international treaties - December 1988.</p> <p>This had the effect of massively reducing the number of charges faced by the senator, offering him perhaps the first glimmer of hope that he would not be sent to Spain.</p> <p>But Mr Straw again sanctioned the extradition proceedings against Gen Pinochet, saying that despite calls to the contrary he could find no compassionate grounds to end the action. Judge Garzon, the Spanish judge leading the attempt to extradite Gen Pinochet, responded by immediately filing more charges relating to incidents after the cut-off date.</p> <p>In October last year London magistrates decided there was nothing to stop him being extradited to Spain. That decision, inevitably, attracted another appeal from Gen Pinochet's lawyers that was due to be heard later this year - but which may now prove irrelevant.</p> <p><b>Dismay</b></p> <p>No doubt last night's decision will cause dismay among those who were pinning their hopes on seeing a man regarded as a brutal dictator brought to trial on the legal action sparked by Spain.</p> <p>But if they can take one crumb of comfort from what has happened it will be that the man responsible for the deaths of more than 3,000 of his own citizens now knows how it feels to be wrenched away from his home and his country.</p> <p>Gen Pinochet may be destined to fly home, but his bruising encounter with a determined Spanish judge and the British courts have spelt out to human rights abusers around the world that international law is catching up with them.</p> <p>The case set a crucial precedent - that former heads of state cannot hide behind the concept of state immunity to avoid prosecution for crimes committed in office.</p>",

Critics of the government's handling of the Pinochet case - and there are many, from Lady Thatcher to Lord Lamont and a whole host of rightwing luminaries in between - will doubtless suggest that yesterday's decision is one that should have been taken 18 months ago. But the medical reports that landed on Mr Straw's desk this week are not the first he has seen relating to the 84-year-old general. When Gen Pinochet was first arrested in 1998 representations were made on behalf of the Chilean senator that his age and health would render it unjust or oppressive to issue an authority to proceed. In answer to a written question in the House of Commons Mr Straw replied that he had considered these carefully, but concluded that it did not appear that Gen Pinochet was unfit to stand to trial, and for him to do so would not be unjust or oppressive. But according to yesterday's statement Gen Pinochet's condition has deteriorated significantly in the past few months. It is ironic that he was in London receiving medical care when he was first arrested in October 1988. His back had gone into spasm during the 17-hour flight from Santiago, and he was in extreme discomfort when he was led from the Lufthansa jet straight into the Hounslow suite, one of four foreign office VIP rooms at Heathrow that are reserved for visiting dignitaries. Little did he know that his arrival in London would set in motion what will no doubt go down as one of the most controversial episodes in British, and international, legal history. A few weeks after his arrival, as he convalesced after back surgery in a London clinic, rumours began circulating that the Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon was preparing to request Gen Pinochet's detention. Less than a week later, still groggy in his hospital bed, he was arrested on charges of murder, torture and terrorism carried out under his 17 year military regime. His arrest stunned and divided the world. The case forced the international community - and the circumstances dictated that it was largely Britain's legal and political institutions to which the task fell - to examine how it could, would and should deal with those who transgress the norms of international behaviour. The legal challenge by Gen Pinochet's lawyers went all the way to the House of Lords where a panel of three law lords threw it out in December 1998, prompting Mr Straw to give his consent to the action proceeding. But the initial ruling was then set aside in an unprecedented move as Gen Pinochet's lawyers argued that links between one of the law lords, Lord Hoffmann, and the human rights group Amnesty International cast doubt on his impartiality. The issue then had to be re-examined by a new panel of law lords. They also decided that Gen Pinochet had no immunity as a former head of state, but they did decide he could only face trial on charges relating to incidents after Britain signed up to crucial international treaties - December 1988. This had the effect of massively reducing the number of charges faced by the senator, offering him perhaps the first glimmer of hope that he would not be sent to Spain. But Mr Straw again sanctioned the extradition proceedings against Gen Pinochet, saying that despite calls to the contrary he could find no compassionate grounds to end the action. Judge Garzon, the Spanish judge leading the attempt to extradite Gen Pinochet, responded by immediately filing more charges relating to incidents after the cut-off date. In October last year London magistrates decided there was nothing to stop him being extradited to Spain. That decision, inevitably, attracted another appeal from Gen Pinochet's lawyers that was due to be heard later this year - but which may now prove irrelevant. Dismay No doubt last night's decision will cause dismay among those who were pinning their hopes on seeing a man regarded as a brutal dictator brought to trial on the legal action sparked by Spain. But if they can take one crumb of comfort from what has happened it will be that the man responsible for the deaths of more than 3,000 of his own citizens now knows how it feels to be wrenched away from his home and his country. Gen Pinochet may be destined to fly home, but his bruising encounter with a determined Spanish judge and the British courts have spelt out to human rights abusers around the world that international law is catching up with them. The case set a crucial precedent - that former heads of state cannot hide behind the concept of state immunity to avoid prosecution for crimes committed in office.",

      "body": "<p>Jack Straw today faced growing pressure to release General Augusto Pinochet's medical records after he indicated he would block the former dictator's extradition to stand trial on charges of torture.</p> <p>Ann Clwyd MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary human rights group, said it was unfair to expect parties such as Amnesty International to make representations within seven days without access to such important information.</p> <p>She said: \"It's in the public interest for that sort of information to be given to those interested parties and it should be done. It should have been left to the Spanish courts to decide whether he was fit to stand trial. There are a number of unanswered questions here.\"</p> <p>Amnesty, which has been involved in the legal manoeuvres for extradition, indicated it wanted to see the medical report by independent experts that appears to have let Gen Pinochet off the hook as far as extradition is concerned.</p> <p>\"I think we will want to see the medical evidence. If he is being released for medical reasons, we would like to see that evidence, so that we are as confident as the home secretary that he is unable to stand trial for medical reasons,\" said Brendan Paddy of Amnesty.</p> <p>But Downing Street said Gen Pinochet and his defence team had the right to privacy, concerning the details of the medical report.</p> <p>\"The point is people having the right to privacy for their medical records - it's the simple point about medical records,\" said the prime minister's office.</p> <p>Although Gen Pinochet appears to have won his fight against extradition to Spain, human rights groups today insisted that human rights law has been strengthened by General Augusto Pinochet's detention, even if the former Chilean dictator eventually returns home.</p> <p>\"While we're sorry that Pinochet and his victims will never have that day in court, this has been a victory from start to finish for the principle of human rights and the rule of law,\" said Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>Moreover, Gen Pinochet's hopes of fading quietly away in Chile may be illusory. Pablo Cabrera, Chile's ambassador in Britain, pointed out that many changes had been made in Chilean law since the closing days of the Pinochet regime, when the dictator passed a wide-ranging law giving himself immunity from prosecution.</p> <p>Nearly 60 criminal complaints await the general in Chile and human rights lawyers are waiting to test the government's promise to strip the general of his senatorial immunity from prosecution and send him to face the courts.</p> <p>\"The law in Chile (now) allows the people and the tribunal to strip off immunity, as has been done already with another senator for other reasons,\" Mr Cabrera said. \"We have many examples that these things are happening now in Chile.\"</p> <p>The 84-year-old general is expected to return to Chile after Mr Straw last night accepted medical evidence that Gen Pinochet is unfit to stand trial in Spain. Mr Straw said he was \"minded\" to block Gen Pinochet's extradition after a team of medical experts reported a deterioration in his condition.</p> <p>Spain quickly signalled it would not take issue with Britain's decision. In a statement, the foreign ministry said: \"The Spanish government has maintained from the first moment an attitude of absolute respect for judicial decisions taken in relation to this case. It is its intention also to respect the decisions of the British government.\"</p> <p>The Spanish government, like Downing Street, had little appetite for a controversial trial that could have disrupted relations with Chile.</p> <p>There was no immediate comment from Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish judge who launched the extradition case, but lawyers working with him said they would continue their fight. Before Mr Straw makes a final ruling, he has given everyone involved in the case seven days to submit arguments for his consideration.</p> <p>Mr Straw also invited France, Switzerland and Belgium, which have extradition requests pending against Gen Pinochet, to respond. But even the general's opponents and human rights groups said there was little chance now he would be extradited.</p> <p>Police, meanwhile, stepped up security around the home near London where Pinochet has been under house arrest for the past 15 months while a debate raged about whether his health - mainly heart problems - was an excuse for him to evade justice.</p> <p>Gen Pinochet has been detained since his arrest on October 16, 1998, following an extradition request. He is accused of using torture to intimidate and silence political opponents throughout his 1973-90 dictatorship. An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared after Gen Pinochet led a coup that toppled the elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende.</p> <p>Last October, Gen Pinochet lost his case before a London magistrate, who ordered him extradited to Spain. But his lawyers appealed and a hearing was scheduled for March 20. His supporters, who include Baroness Thatcher, contend that Gen Pinochet's health has steadily deteriorated since his arrest.</p> <p>He suffers from diabetes, wears a pacemaker and has difficulty walking. His doctors have said that he suffered two minor strokes in September. The Chilean government had urged Mr Straw in October to allow an independent medical team to examine Gen Pinochet's health. Two geriatricians, a neurologist and a fourth doctor spent seven hours examining the former dictator on January 5.</p> <p>\"Following recent deterioration in the state of Senator Pinochet's health ... he is at present unfit to stand trial and no change to that position can be expected,\" the doctors concluded. Their exact medical findings remained confidential.</p> <p>Gen Pinochet was said by friends to be \"delighted\" by the latest twist in his case. But Carlos Reyes, a journalist jailed for two years under Gen Pinochet's rule, said: \"It's unbelievable that a criminal should escape justice because perhaps he is ill or in pain. The pain of my Chilean people is worse than what Pinochet is suffering.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw today faced growing pressure to release General Augusto Pinochet's medical records after he indicated he would block the former dictator's extradition to stand trial on charges of torture. Ann Clwyd MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary human rights group, said it was unfair to expect parties such as Amnesty International to make representations within seven days without access to such important information. She said: \"It's in the public interest for that sort of information to be given to those interested parties and it should be done. It should have been left to the Spanish courts to decide whether he was fit to stand trial. There are a number of unanswered questions here.\" Amnesty, which has been involved in the legal manoeuvres for extradition, indicated it wanted to see the medical report by independent experts that appears to have let Gen Pinochet off the hook as far as extradition is concerned. \"I think we will want to see the medical evidence. If he is being released for medical reasons, we would like to see that evidence, so that we are as confident as the home secretary that he is unable to stand trial for medical reasons,\" said Brendan Paddy of Amnesty. But Downing Street said Gen Pinochet and his defence team had the right to privacy, concerning the details of the medical report. \"The point is people having the right to privacy for their medical records - it's the simple point about medical records,\" said the prime minister's office. Although Gen Pinochet appears to have won his fight against extradition to Spain, human rights groups today insisted that human rights law has been strengthened by General Augusto Pinochet's detention, even if the former Chilean dictator eventually returns home. \"While we're sorry that Pinochet and his victims will never have that day in court, this has been a victory from start to finish for the principle of human rights and the rule of law,\" said Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch. Moreover, Gen Pinochet's hopes of fading quietly away in Chile may be illusory. Pablo Cabrera, Chile's ambassador in Britain, pointed out that many changes had been made in Chilean law since the closing days of the Pinochet regime, when the dictator passed a wide-ranging law giving himself immunity from prosecution. Nearly 60 criminal complaints await the general in Chile and human rights lawyers are waiting to test the government's promise to strip the general of his senatorial immunity from prosecution and send him to face the courts. \"The law in Chile (now) allows the people and the tribunal to strip off immunity, as has been done already with another senator for other reasons,\" Mr Cabrera said. \"We have many examples that these things are happening now in Chile.\" The 84-year-old general is expected to return to Chile after Mr Straw last night accepted medical evidence that Gen Pinochet is unfit to stand trial in Spain. Mr Straw said he was \"minded\" to block Gen Pinochet's extradition after a team of medical experts reported a deterioration in his condition. Spain quickly signalled it would not take issue with Britain's decision. In a statement, the foreign ministry said: \"The Spanish government has maintained from the first moment an attitude of absolute respect for judicial decisions taken in relation to this case. It is its intention also to respect the decisions of the British government.\" The Spanish government, like Downing Street, had little appetite for a controversial trial that could have disrupted relations with Chile. There was no immediate comment from Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish judge who launched the extradition case, but lawyers working with him said they would continue their fight. Before Mr Straw makes a final ruling, he has given everyone involved in the case seven days to submit arguments for his consideration. Mr Straw also invited France, Switzerland and Belgium, which have extradition requests pending against Gen Pinochet, to respond. But even the general's opponents and human rights groups said there was little chance now he would be extradited. Police, meanwhile, stepped up security around the home near London where Pinochet has been under house arrest for the past 15 months while a debate raged about whether his health - mainly heart problems - was an excuse for him to evade justice. Gen Pinochet has been detained since his arrest on October 16, 1998, following an extradition request. He is accused of using torture to intimidate and silence political opponents throughout his 1973-90 dictatorship. An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared after Gen Pinochet led a coup that toppled the elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende. Last October, Gen Pinochet lost his case before a London magistrate, who ordered him extradited to Spain. But his lawyers appealed and a hearing was scheduled for March 20. His supporters, who include Baroness Thatcher, contend that Gen Pinochet's health has steadily deteriorated since his arrest. He suffers from diabetes, wears a pacemaker and has difficulty walking. His doctors have said that he suffered two minor strokes in September. The Chilean government had urged Mr Straw in October to allow an independent medical team to examine Gen Pinochet's health. Two geriatricians, a neurologist and a fourth doctor spent seven hours examining the former dictator on January 5. \"Following recent deterioration in the state of Senator Pinochet's health ... he is at present unfit to stand trial and no change to that position can be expected,\" the doctors concluded. Their exact medical findings remained confidential. Gen Pinochet was said by friends to be \"delighted\" by the latest twist in his case. But Carlos Reyes, a journalist jailed for two years under Gen Pinochet's rule, said: \"It's unbelievable that a criminal should escape justice because perhaps he is ill or in pain. The pain of my Chilean people is worse than what Pinochet is suffering.\"",

It was a problem that could have been seen coming by ministers and they haven't seen it coming and they haven't done anything about it.\" </p> <p>Doctors responsible for collating the flu figures said the outbreak mirrored the problems of last winter. The viral strain - named after Sydney where it was first identified - was the same and, like last year, those affected were mostly elderly. Public health laboratory service statistics showed a level of 197 per 100,000 of the population visiting their GP with flu, just below the normal seasonal peak of 200. By PHLS standards, 400 per 100,000 is an epidemic. </p> <p>But this year, the Chief Medical Officer, Liam Donaldson, has pointed to the increasing numbers contacting NHS Direct with flu symptoms rather than going to their GP. Those, he said, had to be counted in, raising the total to perhaps 300 per 100,000. John Knottenbelt, an accident and emergency consultant at Northwick Park, put the blame on NHS Direct for increasing the pressures on his department. \"This NHS Direct thing is not a good thing as far as we are concerned. All they are telling patients is 'if you are feeling ill, go to A&amp;E'.\" </p> <p>Mr Milburn visited the casualty department at St Mary's hospital in Paddington, where elderly patients were lying on trolleys in the corridor waiting for beds. He insisted that the NHS was coping despite unprecedented demand. </p> <p>\"What we have seen this year is planning and better preparation for the winter pressures which have been put on the health service ... Of course the NHS is under a great deal of pressure, and staff are doing a fantastic job and we are coping with what is a very, very serious outbreak.\" </p> <p>Hospitals would not face financial penalties if they were unable to meet their waiting list reduction targets in the summer because of the backlog caused by the winter crisis. </p> <p>Peter Hawker, chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants committee, said the crisis revealed the under-funded state of the NHS. \"We are running at the limit all the time. Even at a so-called slack time, medical beds will be 95 to 100% full.\" </p> <p>Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health authorities and trusts, called for more funding. </p> <p>He told the BBC: \"Unless we have significant additional resources available for the NHS next year I fear that we could have exactly the same problem in January 2001 as we have got this January.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The flu outbreak has put a stop to one cancer patient's surgery four times. Mavis Skeet, 74, was due to have an eight-hour operation at Leeds general infirmary five weeks ago to remove her gullet and see if her cancer of the oesophagus had spread. The first operation was cancelled because her anaesthetist had flu. On the other three occasions, there has been no intensive care bed available because of the numbers of elderly people with respiratory complications due to flu. </p> <p>\"My mum has been strong up to the last time, but then she broke down and was in tears,\" said Mrs Skeet's daughter, Jane. \"We are very angry. Doctors say they can't tell whether the cancer's spread until they operate, which means it could be spreading all the time there's a lack of beds. </p> <p>\"This is due to lack of resources and bad planning. The government are trying to cover it up by saying the hospitals are coping, but they're obviously not. The operating team seem as frustrated as we are.\"</p>",

By PHLS standards, 400 per 100,000 is an epidemic. But this year, the Chief Medical Officer, Liam Donaldson, has pointed to the increasing numbers contacting NHS Direct with flu symptoms rather than going to their GP. Those, he said, had to be counted in, raising the total to perhaps 300 per 100,000. John Knottenbelt, an accident and emergency consultant at Northwick Park, put the blame on NHS Direct for increasing the pressures on his department. \"This NHS Direct thing is not a good thing as far as we are concerned. All they are telling patients is 'if you are feeling ill, go to A&amp;E'.\" Mr Milburn visited the casualty department at St Mary's hospital in Paddington, where elderly patients were lying on trolleys in the corridor waiting for beds. He insisted that the NHS was coping despite unprecedented demand. \"What we have seen this year is planning and better preparation for the winter pressures which have been put on the health service ... Of course the NHS is under a great deal of pressure, and staff are doing a fantastic job and we are coping with what is a very, very serious outbreak.\" Hospitals would not face financial penalties if they were unable to meet their waiting list reduction targets in the summer because of the backlog caused by the winter crisis. Peter Hawker, chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants committee, said the crisis revealed the under-funded state of the NHS. \"We are running at the limit all the time. Even at a so-called slack time, medical beds will be 95 to 100% full.\" Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health authorities and trusts, called for more funding. He told the BBC: \"Unless we have significant additional resources available for the NHS next year I fear that we could have exactly the same problem in January 2001 as we have got this January.\" \u0095 The flu outbreak has put a stop to one cancer patient's surgery four times. Mavis Skeet, 74, was due to have an eight-hour operation at Leeds general infirmary five weeks ago to remove her gullet and see if her cancer of the oesophagus had spread. The first operation was cancelled because her anaesthetist had flu. On the other three occasions, there has been no intensive care bed available because of the numbers of elderly people with respiratory complications due to flu. \"My mum has been strong up to the last time, but then she broke down and was in tears,\" said Mrs Skeet's daughter, Jane. \"We are very angry. Doctors say they can't tell whether the cancer's spread until they operate, which means it could be spreading all the time there's a lack of beds. \"This is due to lack of resources and bad planning. The government are trying to cover it up by saying the hospitals are coping, but they're obviously not. The operating team seem as frustrated as we are.\"",

      "body": "<p>In 1904, a Russian peasant in the back of beyond murders his brother with an axe, then hops the train to St Petersburg. Arriving in the city, he steps on to the platform and sees something he can't begin to understand - a Frenchman turning a handle on a wooden box. Our man peers closely at this marvel, and gets booted out of the way for his pains. Ninety years later, documentary makers open a can of film - a roll of 1904 Path\u00e9 cinematograph footage, showing a train arriving at St Petersburg. It's pretty much a direct remake of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers' train film of 1895, except for this inopportunely curious hick from nowhere, sticking his bearded face into the lens just when the footage was looking usable. The documentarists trim the film and toss the rejected footage, with our hero on it, into the bin, never to be seen again. </p> <p>This poignant vignette is the story of Trofim, a 1995 short by Russian film-maker Alexei Balabanov. Trofim can be taken either as a Borges-style parable of the way that history's best anecdotes - the blood-and-passion, true-crime stuff - are invariably consigned to oblivion, or as a scathing comment on practices of film preservation in the former Soviet Union. Or you might see it as an oblique comment on the current status of Russian cinema, which these days, like Trofim the peasant, might as well not exist at all. </p> <p>The last time the west really noticed Russian-language film was in the early 90s, when there was a brief buzz about the prospects for post-perestroika cinema. But hardly any new Russian films were released in Britain in the 90s, and the few exceptions were barely noted: Sergei Bodrov's critically praised Prisoner of the Mountains made not the faintest stir with audiences, Valery Todorovsky's superb Katia Ismailova - film noir in a Chekhov setting - even less. </p> <p>There's next to no chance of British exposure for Alexei Guerman's film Khroustaliov, My Car!, a Fellini-esque delirium set in the Stalin era, which provoked disgruntled walk-outs in Cannes in 1998, but went on to be acclaimed as a masterpiece when released in Paris and New York. The only film-maker who has any real western following is Aleksandr Sokurov, whose brief, enigmatic - and for my money, indigestibly mystical - Mother and Son had high-powered pundits such as Paul Schrader and Susan Sontag acclaiming it as the spiritual real deal. </p> <p>Since the western art-house circuit is still ruled by the cult of the auteur, then a cultish auteur is surely Russian cinema's best chance to re-establish itself on the map. Such a contender gets an airing in Britain this week: Trofim's director Alexei Balabanov, with his first feature Happy Days screening at the ICA. It's the least confident of the three Balabanov features I've seen - the fourth is a version of Kafka's The Castle - but it's as bizarre and distinctive as debuts come. </p> <p> Tenuously based on Beckett, it has a nameless hero who wanders through St Petersburg's eerily deserted streets, takes up with a faintly demented prostitute and tangles with an angry clock-seller. The logic is entirely dream-like, and although the romantic melancholy takes a little swallowing, Balabanov's eye for grandeur and squalor, from sweeping shots of palace rooftops to explorations of ancient corridors and stairwells, makes Happy Days seem like a film from another time and another planet. </p> <p>Also due for release this year is the fabulously perverse Of Freaks and Men (1998), a tale of early 20th-century St Petersburg in which two respectable families fall prey to a gang of pornographers: their speciality is filming young Russian maidens getting spanked with birch brooms by stout baboushkas. The silent-era pastiche, all sepia tints, is spot-on, although nostalgists would be horrified by Balabanov's scabrous picture of an art form developing in such profoundly sordid circumstances. </p> <p>But it's Balabanov's venture into hard realism that has caused most stir in Russia. The 1997 thriller Brother has an apparently clueless young man signing up as a mafia hireling and showing such a propensity for businesslike killing that he soon rises to the top of the criminal tree. A brutally streamlined piece of storytelling, Brother struck Russian audiences as a timely state-of-the-nation horror tale, although there was much debate about its seemingly amoral stance. While young audiences eagerly took to Balabanov's young hood Danila as a modern folk hero, more conservative viewers saw Brother as a shockingly amoral tale that boded ill for the nation's spiritual welfare. Its most notable opponent was the veteran director Nikita Mikhalkov, who attacked it for being \"imbued with destruction\". </p> <p>Then again, Mikhalkov himself did Russian cinema no favours with his international pudding of a historical epic, The Barber of Siberia, starring Julia Ormond. This three-hour repertoire of touristic myths of old Russia - bears, vodka and gallant waltzing cadets - proved something of a laughing stock at Cannes last year. Amoral or otherwise, the bracingly cynical Balabanov has succeeded in taking Russian cinema out into the world, and is now completing Brother 2, in which Danila takes on America. </p> <p>There are no plans yet for The Barber of Siberia 2.</p>",

But hardly any new Russian films were released in Britain in the 90s, and the few exceptions were barely noted: Sergei Bodrov's critically praised Prisoner of the Mountains made not the faintest stir with audiences, Valery Todorovsky's superb Katia Ismailova - film noir in a Chekhov setting - even less. There's next to no chance of British exposure for Alexei Guerman's film Khroustaliov, My Car!, a Fellini-esque delirium set in the Stalin era, which provoked disgruntled walk-outs in Cannes in 1998, but went on to be acclaimed as a masterpiece when released in Paris and New York. The only film-maker who has any real western following is Aleksandr Sokurov, whose brief, enigmatic - and for my money, indigestibly mystical - Mother and Son had high-powered pundits such as Paul Schrader and Susan Sontag acclaiming it as the spiritual real deal. Since the western art-house circuit is still ruled by the cult of the auteur, then a cultish auteur is surely Russian cinema's best chance to re-establish itself on the map. Such a contender gets an airing in Britain this week: Trofim's director Alexei Balabanov, with his first feature Happy Days screening at the ICA. It's the least confident of the three Balabanov features I've seen - the fourth is a version of Kafka's The Castle - but it's as bizarre and distinctive as debuts come. Tenuously based on Beckett, it has a nameless hero who wanders through St Petersburg's eerily deserted streets, takes up with a faintly demented prostitute and tangles with an angry clock-seller. The logic is entirely dream-like, and although the romantic melancholy takes a little swallowing, Balabanov's eye for grandeur and squalor, from sweeping shots of palace rooftops to explorations of ancient corridors and stairwells, makes Happy Days seem like a film from another time and another planet. Also due for release this year is the fabulously perverse Of Freaks and Men (1998), a tale of early 20th-century St Petersburg in which two respectable families fall prey to a gang of pornographers: their speciality is filming young Russian maidens getting spanked with birch brooms by stout baboushkas. The silent-era pastiche, all sepia tints, is spot-on, although nostalgists would be horrified by Balabanov's scabrous picture of an art form developing in such profoundly sordid circumstances. But it's Balabanov's venture into hard realism that has caused most stir in Russia. The 1997 thriller Brother has an apparently clueless young man signing up as a mafia hireling and showing such a propensity for businesslike killing that he soon rises to the top of the criminal tree. A brutally streamlined piece of storytelling, Brother struck Russian audiences as a timely state-of-the-nation horror tale, although there was much debate about its seemingly amoral stance. While young audiences eagerly took to Balabanov's young hood Danila as a modern folk hero, more conservative viewers saw Brother as a shockingly amoral tale that boded ill for the nation's spiritual welfare. Its most notable opponent was the veteran director Nikita Mikhalkov, who attacked it for being \"imbued with destruction\". Then again, Mikhalkov himself did Russian cinema no favours with his international pudding of a historical epic, The Barber of Siberia, starring Julia Ormond. This three-hour repertoire of touristic myths of old Russia - bears, vodka and gallant waltzing cadets - proved something of a laughing stock at Cannes last year. Amoral or otherwise, the bracingly cynical Balabanov has succeeded in taking Russian cinema out into the world, and is now completing Brother 2, in which Danila takes on America. There are no plans yet for The Barber of Siberia 2.",

      "body": "<p>The former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is to be sent home next week after Jack Straw accepted \"unequivocal and unanimous\" medical evidence that he is unfit to stand trial in Spain on charges of torture.</p> <p>In a move which was condemned by human rights groups, the home secretary said he was \"minded\" to block General Pinochet's extradition after a team of independent doctors reported a deterioration in his medical condition.</p> <p>Mr Straw is to give the Spanish authorities and human rights groups seven days to raise objections to his decision. However, home office sources indicated last night that Gen Pinochet, 84, who has been fighting extradition to Spain for more than a year, will be on his way home towards the end of next week.</p> <p>The Spanish government, which was informed of the decision in advance, said last night it would respect the home secretary's decision and would not make any move to force extradition.</p> <p>Mr Straw's move, which was announced 24 hours earlier than planned after pressure from the Chilean authorities, was immediately hailed by Margaret Thatcher, who has championed a rightwing campaign to prevent Gen Pinochet from being extradited.</p> <p>Lady Thatcher, who has criticised Mr Straw for making political capital out of Gen Pinochet, said: \"I would trust the home secretary's judgment. He is a very fair man.\"</p> <p>Gen Pinochet, who remains under 24-hour armed guard in a rented house on the Wentworth estate in Surrey, was said to be \"delighted\" by Mr Straw's decision.</p> <p>Human rights campaigners condemned the move and pledged to mount an immediate challenge in the courts. Helen Banber, director of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said: \"Any decision by Jack Straw to release Gen Pinochet on health grounds should be subject to immediate judicial review ... There is no release for the mental and physical pain which many of the foundation's Chilean clients suffer from following their torture by the Pinochet regime.\"</p> <p>Amnesty International said that Gen Pinochet could still stand trial in Britain - under the Torture Convention - because the director of public prosecutions has the power to decide whether a suspect is fit to stand trial in this country.</p> <p>The row over Gen Pinochet broke last night after Mr Straw announced he had accepted the evidence of four independent doctors, including two gerontologists and a neurologist, who examined Gen Pinochet for six hours on January 5.</p> <p>Mr Straw called for the examination after the Chilean embassy warned last October of a \"significant deterioration\" in Gen Pinochet's condition. He is believed to be suffering from renal problems, possibly brought on by diabetes, a heart condition and a neurological condition, which has led to three minor strokes. He is also said to be suffering from depression, brought on by his 16 months under house arrest.</p> <p>A statement from the home office said: \"The unequivocal and unanimous conclusion of the ... medical practitioners ... is that, following recent deterioration in the state of Senator Pinochet's health which seems to have occurred principally during September and October 1999, he is at present unfit to stand trial, and that no change to that position can be expected.\"</p> <p>The report will remain confidential and will not be shown to any of the groups who want to challenge Mr Straw's decision.</p> <p>Mr Straw will face fierce opposition in the House of Commons today, when the Tories attempt to raise the matter. The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, said: \"The government has played enormous politics over this case.

      "bodyText": "The former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is to be sent home next week after Jack Straw accepted \"unequivocal and unanimous\" medical evidence that he is unfit to stand trial in Spain on charges of torture. In a move which was condemned by human rights groups, the home secretary said he was \"minded\" to block General Pinochet's extradition after a team of independent doctors reported a deterioration in his medical condition. Mr Straw is to give the Spanish authorities and human rights groups seven days to raise objections to his decision. However, home office sources indicated last night that Gen Pinochet, 84, who has been fighting extradition to Spain for more than a year, will be on his way home towards the end of next week. The Spanish government, which was informed of the decision in advance, said last night it would respect the home secretary's decision and would not make any move to force extradition. Mr Straw's move, which was announced 24 hours earlier than planned after pressure from the Chilean authorities, was immediately hailed by Margaret Thatcher, who has championed a rightwing campaign to prevent Gen Pinochet from being extradited. Lady Thatcher, who has criticised Mr Straw for making political capital out of Gen Pinochet, said: \"I would trust the home secretary's judgment. He is a very fair man.\" Gen Pinochet, who remains under 24-hour armed guard in a rented house on the Wentworth estate in Surrey, was said to be \"delighted\" by Mr Straw's decision. Human rights campaigners condemned the move and pledged to mount an immediate challenge in the courts. Helen Banber, director of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said: \"Any decision by Jack Straw to release Gen Pinochet on health grounds should be subject to immediate judicial review ... There is no release for the mental and physical pain which many of the foundation's Chilean clients suffer from following their torture by the Pinochet regime.\" Amnesty International said that Gen Pinochet could still stand trial in Britain - under the Torture Convention - because the director of public prosecutions has the power to decide whether a suspect is fit to stand trial in this country. The row over Gen Pinochet broke last night after Mr Straw announced he had accepted the evidence of four independent doctors, including two gerontologists and a neurologist, who examined Gen Pinochet for six hours on January 5. Mr Straw called for the examination after the Chilean embassy warned last October of a \"significant deterioration\" in Gen Pinochet's condition. He is believed to be suffering from renal problems, possibly brought on by diabetes, a heart condition and a neurological condition, which has led to three minor strokes. He is also said to be suffering from depression, brought on by his 16 months under house arrest. A statement from the home office said: \"The unequivocal and unanimous conclusion of the ... medical practitioners ... is that, following recent deterioration in the state of Senator Pinochet's health which seems to have occurred principally during September and October 1999, he is at present unfit to stand trial, and that no change to that position can be expected.\" The report will remain confidential and will not be shown to any of the groups who want to challenge Mr Straw's decision. Mr Straw will face fierce opposition in the House of Commons today, when the Tories attempt to raise the matter. The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, said: \"The government has played enormous politics over this case. Why on earth has it taken so long to compile this medical report when it has been known for months that Senator Pinochet is ill?\" Leftwing Labour backbenchers will round on Mr Straw for caving into Gen Pinochet. Diane Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said: \"This is monstrous. There will be a lot of concern among the public about this.\" Mr Straw's decision to allow Gen Pinochet to return home heralds the end of one of the most controversial episodes in recent British legal history, which began when the former dictator was arrested in a London hospital as he recovered from a back operation in october 1998. The Tories accused Mr Straw of using the issue to placate Labour's left, while the government said that Lady Thatcher's enthusiastic support for a blood-soaked former dictator showed how extreme the Tories are. In Chile, where a democratically elected government has replaced Gen Pinochet's dictatorship, there were widespread fears that a trial in Spain could destabilise the country by reopening painful memories. However, the legal battles could continue if human rights groups, or the Spanish authorities, successfully challenge Mr Straw.",

They have accused Pakistan players of match-fixing, while keeping the indiscretions of Warne and Waugh junior firmly between themselves and ICC. New Zealander John Reid, a member of ICC's technical committee, and the match referee who referred Shoaib's case, is in cahoots with his Antipodean neighbours, say the conspiracy theorists.

Better this than the spectacle of an aged prisoner, feeble in mind and body, being hurried towards death by a Spanish court. The home secretary's decision brings the right end to a thoroughly satisfactory episode. The arrest brought to world prominence a shocking history that many people, including governments such as the British which were happy to treat with Pinochet as an arms-purchaser, had conveniently forgotten.

Finally, he made a deathless contribution not only to British but international law. If Pinochet had not been arraigned, the House of Lords would not have had the opportunity to rule that former heads of state can no longer claim immunity from prosecution under international conventions. This was a historic piece of law-making, underwritten by no fewer than nine law lords, which fundamentally extends the reach of international law into domestic courts and, as such, will help to reinforce that concept in courts far beyond these islands. That might have happened anyway, in some other case of a torturer who strayed into a foreign land where he thought the establishment would make him safe. God knows, there are enough of them about. But it fell to General Pinochet to cause the mark to be made. He will be the forbear of others like him, now likely to think twice before imagining they can rely on amnesty in any place with an honest legal system.</p> <p>This new legality is inextinguishable. Mr Straw does not wipe it out by sending the untried criminal home. No doubt he saves himself some trouble; and the Spanish government will be even more relieved. These are not edifying considerations. If the general had been in proper health, it would have been good to see the legal process to its end. Pinochet's last years of ruin offered only modest retribution. But since he is a wreck, let comfort be drawn from the immortal service he most unwillingly did: help, via the judges, make the civilised world better protected against people like himself.</p>",

If Pinochet had not been arraigned, the House of Lords would not have had the opportunity to rule that former heads of state can no longer claim immunity from prosecution under international conventions. This was a historic piece of law-making, underwritten by no fewer than nine law lords, which fundamentally extends the reach of international law into domestic courts and, as such, will help to reinforce that concept in courts far beyond these islands. That might have happened anyway, in some other case of a torturer who strayed into a foreign land where he thought the establishment would make him safe. God knows, there are enough of them about. But it fell to General Pinochet to cause the mark to be made. He will be the forbear of others like him, now likely to think twice before imagining they can rely on amnesty in any place with an honest legal system. This new legality is inextinguishable. Mr Straw does not wipe it out by sending the untried criminal home. No doubt he saves himself some trouble; and the Spanish government will be even more relieved. These are not edifying considerations. If the general had been in proper health, it would have been good to see the legal process to its end. Pinochet's last years of ruin offered only modest retribution. But since he is a wreck, let comfort be drawn from the immortal service he most unwillingly did: help, via the judges, make the civilised world better protected against people like himself.",

      "bodyText": "The secretary of state [Jack Straw] has over past months received a number of representations concerning Senator Pinochet's state of health. Until last October, these did not appear to suggest any material change in the position since the secretary of state's consideration of issues relating to Senator Pinochet's health at the time he gave authority to proceed in the case on 14 April 1999. Senator Pinochet has not himself since then made direct representations to the secretary of state about his state of health, nor has he at any time put his fitness to stand trial directly in issue in any legal proceedings in the case. Representations on the subject were, however, submitted by the Chilean embassy on 14 October 1999, attaching recent medical reports on Senator Pinochet. These suggestions that there had been recent and significant deterioration in Senator Pinochet's condition. When the secretary of state first received, from the Chilean Embassy, indications supported by medical evidence that the situation might have changed, he took the view that he needed to inform himself more fully before deciding whether any further action by him might be appropriate. He therefore requested Senator Pinochet to undergo a thorough and extensive medical examination, to be undertaken by an eminent team of clinicians to be appointed by the secretary of state, with a view to obtaining comprehensive advice on his condition. Senator Pinochet gave that consent, and agreed to the ensuing medical report being available in full to the secretary of state and to the prosecuting authorities. The examination was undertaken on January 5 by a team of expert clinicians established by the secretary of state as being of outstanding national and international reputation and as having no inappropriate personal interest in the case. The team consisted of Professor Sir John Grimley Evans FRCP, Professor of Clinical Geratology, University of Oxford; Dr Michael Denham MD FRCP (Lond. Edin.) FRSA, Consultant Physician in Geriatric Medicine, Northwick Park Hospital, London; Professor Andrew Lees MD FRCP, Professor of Neurology, the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London and Maria Wyke MA PhD, Consultant Neuropsychologist. Professor Lees and Dr Wyke are fluent Spanish speakers, and the examination was conducted in Spanish. Any questions put to the doctors or their places of work will be immediately referred to the home office press office. In particular they cannot make any comment whatsoever on the details of the Senator's case due to patient confidentiality. The secretary of state has now received the team's report. The detail of the report is and remains confidential to Senator Pinochet, but the unequivocal and unanimous conclusion of the three medical practitioners and the consultant neuropsychologist is that, following recent deterioration in the state of Senator Pinochet's health which seems to have occurred principally during September and October 1999, he is at present unfit to stand trial, and that no change to that position can be expected. In the circumstances, the secretary of state is minded, subject to any representations he may receive, to take the view that no purpose would be served by continuing the present extradition proceedings and that he should therefore decide not to extradite Senator Pinochet. The home office is writing to the crown prosecution service as representatives of the Kingdom of Spain and to the Government of Chile, informing them of the above matters and inviting them to make representations. Letters are also going to France, Belgium and Switzerland who have outstanding extradition requests. Amnesty International, the Caring for Victims of Torture Medical Foundation, the Redress Trust, the Association of Disappeared Persons in Chile and Human Rights Watch, have been invited, in the circumstances, to submit any further representations they consider the secretary of state should take into account in considering such a decision. All representations are sought within seven days. Senator Pinochet has been asked to agree to Spain and other countries with an outstanding extradition request being provided with a copy of the medical report. He has, however, declined to do so. The home secretary will make a statement to parliament on the case when it is finally concluded.",

      "bodyText": "British beef yesterday got its biggest boost since the EU lifted the worldwide export ban last August when a Dutch company signed a \u00a32.5m-a-year contract for meat from Welsh farmers. The deal with Ven International involves supplying hotels and restaurants in the Netherlands with 350 tonnes annually and represents the first success for Welsh branded beef. Christine Gwyther, the Welsh agriculture secretary, said: \"It is a drop in the ocean but very exciting. The Welsh beef industry has suffered severely over the last few years and this is a clear signal things are moving in the right direction.\" She said Welsh lamb was already popular with the Dutch and there would be further success for beef from grass-fed cattle that had not been reared intensively. British beef has so far had a rough ride back into Europe. The French, our biggest customers before the ban was imposed over BSE fears, face lengthy legal action over their authorities continuing refusal to accept the meat. Tony Blair was quick to congratulate the Welsh farmers. \"The measures we have taken to eradicate BSE and to ensure that our beef is as safe as any in Europe are now paying off.\"",

The problem is this: if there is to be open access to conduit and content then why is there such a pressing need for AOL and TW to merge. If there isn't, and the real motive is to restrict access in order to keep prices higher, then it is a serious matter. The markets are so smitten by an \"internet company\" (though actually AOL is a pre-web dial-up service) marrying old technology thereby justifying the inflated prices of web stocks that they haven't had time to consider the real world. Unless this is sorted out now the next giant merger and the one after will point to AOL/TW as a precedent to allow them through the regulatory hoops. It is difficult for net companies, let alone the regulators, to keep up with the dizzy pace of activity.

Third, whether there should be guidelines over what happens when media giants own both the conduit and the content sent down them. The problem is this: if there is to be open access to conduit and content then why is there such a pressing need for AOL and TW to merge. If there isn't, and the real motive is to restrict access in order to keep prices higher, then it is a serious matter. The markets are so smitten by an \"internet company\" (though actually AOL is a pre-web dial-up service) marrying old technology thereby justifying the inflated prices of web stocks that they haven't had time to consider the real world. Unless this is sorted out now the next giant merger and the one after will point to AOL/TW as a precedent to allow them through the regulatory hoops. It is difficult for net companies, let alone the regulators, to keep up with the dizzy pace of activity. Which is why we must pause in order to decide what sort of future we want and whether it should be moulded by consumers or big corporations.",

The fighters' skill at orchestrating sudden, damaging raids into Russian terroritory helped secure their victory then. Embarrassed by the series of Chechen counter-attacks, the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, Colonel General Viktor Kazantsev, acknowledged that \"mistakes\" had been made when federal troops took control of the areas before Christmas. Asked to clarify what he meant by mistakes, he said: \"They include our tender-heartedness and frequently absolutely groundless trust\" when checking the area for militants. The army has frequently claimed it is unable to distinguish between Chechen fighters and civilians or refugees, hence the decision to classify all males between 10 and 60 as rebels. Peter Bouckaert, a representative for Human Rights Watch in the region, said the ploy was not only unacceptable but counter-productive. \"One of the main reasons why many young men have not left areas of combat is that they are afraid to go through the checkpoints. This will only reinforce that fear,\" he said. But the Chechen rebels yesterday professed defiance, promising fresh assaults on Russian positions. \"This is just the beginning of a series of actions intended to free the areas occupied by the Russians,\" the rebel chief of staff, Mumadi Saidayev, said.",

      "body": "<p>Paul Whiteley and Patrick Seyd's analysis (Vote winners, January 11) flies in the face of most Labour party activists' experience in the current debate on electoral reform. Every recent test of opinion, including the 1998 Labour party conference which demonstrated overwhelming support for retaining First Past The Post, and reported results of the recent consultation exercise, prove that party members do not want PR for Westminster.</p> <p>It might interest Whiteley and Seyd that trade unions like the AEEU have democratically reached a policy of supporting FPTP. PR is the politics of defeatism and I for one, along with many colleagues of every shade of opinion in the Labour party and trade union movement, want our Labour government to create jobs, improve the NHS and provide ever better education, rather than tinker with the voting system.</p> <p>Let's face the facts: Labour party members do not want PR, have never wanted PR and will never want PR. Our loyalty is to the Labour party - not to the politics of coalition and defeatism. <br><b>Sir Ken Jackson</b><br> General secretary<br>Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union</p> <p>\u0095 The survey by Professors Whiteley and Seyd on the support for electoral reform in the Labour party is interesting but not entirely relevant to the recent consultation on the Jenkins report.</p> <p>The statement put to the panels of Labour members in the survey was whether or not Britain's electoral system should be replaced by a system of proportional representation. Unfortunately for the pro-PR lobby, Labour members have been asked to comment on the particular system of AV plus proposed by Roy Jenkins. Jenkins proposes more party lists, a weakening of the constituency link and coalition governments.

      "bodyText": "Paul Whiteley and Patrick Seyd's analysis (Vote winners, January 11) flies in the face of most Labour party activists' experience in the current debate on electoral reform. Every recent test of opinion, including the 1998 Labour party conference which demonstrated overwhelming support for retaining First Past The Post, and reported results of the recent consultation exercise, prove that party members do not want PR for Westminster. It might interest Whiteley and Seyd that trade unions like the AEEU have democratically reached a policy of supporting FPTP. PR is the politics of defeatism and I for one, along with many colleagues of every shade of opinion in the Labour party and trade union movement, want our Labour government to create jobs, improve the NHS and provide ever better education, rather than tinker with the voting system. Let's face the facts: Labour party members do not want PR, have never wanted PR and will never want PR. Our loyalty is to the Labour party - not to the politics of coalition and defeatism. Sir Ken Jackson General secretary Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union \u0095 The survey by Professors Whiteley and Seyd on the support for electoral reform in the Labour party is interesting but not entirely relevant to the recent consultation on the Jenkins report. The statement put to the panels of Labour members in the survey was whether or not Britain's electoral system should be replaced by a system of proportional representation. Unfortunately for the pro-PR lobby, Labour members have been asked to comment on the particular system of AV plus proposed by Roy Jenkins. Jenkins proposes more party lists, a weakening of the constituency link and coalition governments. Faced with the reality of this system, it is little wonder that Labour members have been less than enthusiastic in their submissions to the party's policy forum. In government, it is not enough to want to change something. You have to be clear about what you are changing to. Michael Dugher London \u0095 Jack Straw believes that \"people can see that fair votes will lead to very unfair elections\" ('Fair and effective' Straw lays down the law, January 10). What people can see is that more proportional voting systems do not allow politicians to do everything they want when they only have minority support within the electorate. They see that Labour, with little more than a third of the vote, was denied outright control of the Scottish parliament and that in the European elections, the Conservatives, with only 36% of the vote, were denied a massive majority over Labour. It is too early to know what balance of opinion will emerge from Labour's recent consultation but, as the Guardian's coverage of last week's leaks makes clear, Jack Straw's \"evidence\" of a swing against reform is not of the quality which should satisfy a former barrister. Dr Ken Ritchie Chief executive Electoral Reform Society \u0095 Roy Hattersley has blown the gaff (Fighting the soggy centre, January 10). By opposing PR old Labour \"can - and it seems we will - prevent the institutional change which would extinguish all hope of a democratic socialist government ever being elected\".

Kate Hoey has successfully lobbied Ofsted to turn its baleful inspectorial eye upon school sports. It is not just because the reading, writing and reckoning mind should be in a body that can jump high or kick a ball between two posts. Upon better performance on the playing fields that were not sold off by the Tories depends English identity: for where else does that straw man better express himself (English women do not seem to figure much in the nationalism debate) than on the football or cricket pitch. The model is simple enough. An inspector calls and a generation on, Kevin Keegan's successor, picking from an embarrassment of talent, gets to sweep the 2014 world cup. In his dreams. The fact is, there is no ready correlation between triumph in the school first XI and national sporting success. Besides, it is not clear England has a problem. Look at the success - even if temporary - of David O'Leary's largely home-grown outfit at Leeds: much talent still flows into professional football. English cricket has its problems, true, but they have as much to do with the governance of a sport where the old fart factor remains strong. On the Continent school sports - activities organised by teachers in school hours - are largely unknown but that has not stopped Les Bleus or impeded Italian skiers. There are all sorts of ways the state can and ought to encourage participation in competitive sport (ballroom dancing and skateboarding included). They do not necessarily include Chris Woodhead's pedagogical stormtroopers getting their stopwatches out to time performance in the 100 metres or measure the penalty-taking potential of England's future Gareth Southgates.",

      "bodyText": "A woman whose remains were found buried in a well 57 years after she disappeared was probably the victim of foul play, an inquest heard yesterday. Jessie McMahon vanished from her Hampshire home in April 1942, after telling her mother she was going out to collect firewood. The woman's husband and the son of a local landowner were questioned but no charges were brought. The inquest in Portsmouth heard that her skeleton had been found by workmen last year, and that Mrs McMahon, who disappeared when she was 31, had probably been pushed into the well. Recording an open verdict, the coroner, James Kenroy, said foul play seemed probable, but the skeleton had lain undiscovered for too long for the cause of death to be identified. After the inquest, Mrs McMahon's daughter, Eileen Howard, said she was convinced her mother's death had not been an accident. Workmen were turning the disused well at Liss, near Petersfield, into a garden feature when they discovered the body in June last year. As they excavated the rubble and debris they found the skeleton lying head first in the well. Detectives traced the wedding ring and shoes which were found with the skeleton. Local historians told police of a woman who had disappeared from Lyss Place farm during the war and had never been seen again. From details of the story detectives were able to contact Mrs McMahon's daughters, Eileen and Maureen, who were aged eight and four at the time of the disappearance. DNA tests eventually linked the remains with the family and she was formally identified as the mother. In a report read to the inquest, Detective Constable David Keevil said Mrs McMahon's marriage to John McMahon, a bus driver, was stormy and violent. The family had been evacuated to Liss from Portsmouth several months before the disappearance and Mr McMahon had taken on a second job, driving lorries at night. On the night of the disappearance, April 29, Mr McMahon had been asleep upstairs at the farm. Mrs McMahon said she was going out to collect firewood and her mother had warned her to be back in time to wake her husband at 9pm. When her husband woke up he went out to look for her, saying: \"I'll kill her when she gets back.\" A police and Home Guard search also failed to find any trace of the woman. Ponds and manure heaps were searched but the well, which was disused, was not. The landowner's son, Alfred Stanley, who had taken part in the search, later emerged as one of the prime suspects. He was known as a womaniser and was believed to have made advances towards Mrs McMahon. Speaking after the inquest Mrs Howard said that when she was 13 or 14 she had returned to confront Mr Stanley about the death of her mother, but was told he and his father had gone to Australia. Mr McMahon was questioned for 24 hours but later released. He died in 1992. The inquest was told that Mr Stanley had also died, although no death certificate could be found. A home office pathologist, Roger Ainsworth, said there was no evidence of any bones having been broken, and he could not ascertain the cause of death. Mr Kenroy said it was tragic that two children should have been robbed of their mother and then left ignorant about her fate for more than half a century. \"The circumstances certainly suggest foul play. \"But due to the passage of time it would seem that anyone who could have helped police with their inquiries is now deceased.\" Mrs Howard, 65, said her younger sister, who now lived in York, had always hoped her mother had simply run away. But she herself had always believed her mother had been killed.",

      "bodyText": "A violent intruder with a leather fixation who attacks women alone at home has struck for the eighth time, police said yesterday. The man is thought to select well-dressed victims, including secretaries and members of the legal profession, and keep them under surveillance before striking. All the attacks have taken place in south-east London since last September and the man has demanded \"trophies\" of leather trousers, purses and gloves from the women. One 42-year-old victim said yesterday she had become too scared to use a vacuum cleaner in case it drowned out the sound of an intruder breaking into her home. She had just got in through her front door when the man ordered her to hand over a glove and her purse. \"He was fairly calm but insistent upon what he wanted. At one point he hit me a couple of times because I couldn't give him what he was asking for - I didn't have my purse on me.\" She escaped to neighbours to raise the alarm but said she had completely changed since the attack. \"I get paranoid about every noise as if someone has come in my house. I used to be an independent person but now I can't go out or back into my house without someone coming in with me.\" Some of the victims, aged from their 20s to their 50s, are thought to have been followed as they walked home alone from railway stations after work. In the latest attack on Monday night, a 50-year-old woman was confronted at her home in Catford by a man dressed in black with a stocking mask over his face. He grabbed the woman, demanding her leather gloves and shoulder bag. Detective Chief Inspector Phil Fitzgerald, who is heading the inquiry, said: \"It's about power, control and violence which suggests there might be a more sinister motive as to why he's terrorising these women. \"He has made no sexual advances at the moment and he has made no threats to cause someone serious injury. But since the start of this series the violence has increased. We have got to find that man before someone gets seriously hurt.\"",

One witness said the police van had been travelling fast but had slowed before it hit Miss McDonald, 44, who was crossing the road.</p> <p>She suffered brain injuries and was in a coma for 72 hours, remained in intensive care for two weeks, and needed treatment for a further two months.</p> <p>Helen McCormack, prosecuting, said Whiteley found his path blocked by stationary traffic, so drove on the other side of the road, travelling in the wrong direction.</p> <p>The van's sirens and flashing lights were on, but Whiteley's colleague warned him the pedestrian was looking in the wrong direction.</p> <p>\"His fellow police officer noted that she appeared to be looking away from the direction they were coming from,\" said Miss McCormack. \"But PC Whiteley was later to tell an officer investigating the case that she had glanced in his direction and he had assumed that, because he had his sirens on, she would have seen him.\"</p> <p>Miss McCormack said although he slowed, Miss McDonald was struck by the front passenger side of the van, which braked, carried on a few yards and stopped. \"But it had to be reversed to free her from the van,\" she said.</p> <p>Paulo Canaccuti, who saw the accident, told the court: \"They were travelling really fast at around 40 to 45mph, I guess.\"</p> <p>PC Malcolm Cumberlidge, an accident reconstruction specialist, said Whiteley had been driving too close to the centre of the road.</p> <p>\"The vehicle should have been slightly further to the right of the road, which would have been a safer distance.

      "bodyText": "A police driver who knocked down the Channel 4 newsreader Sheena McDonald was on the wrong side of the road, a court heard yesterday. Glenn Whiteley, 27, a constable with the Metropolitan police, pleaded not guilty to driving without due care and attention when he appeared before Horseferry Road magistrates, London. The accident happened last February near Miss McDonald's home in Islington, north London, when Whiteley was answering an emergency call with a colleague. One witness said the police van had been travelling fast but had slowed before it hit Miss McDonald, 44, who was crossing the road. She suffered brain injuries and was in a coma for 72 hours, remained in intensive care for two weeks, and needed treatment for a further two months. Helen McCormack, prosecuting, said Whiteley found his path blocked by stationary traffic, so drove on the other side of the road, travelling in the wrong direction. The van's sirens and flashing lights were on, but Whiteley's colleague warned him the pedestrian was looking in the wrong direction. \"His fellow police officer noted that she appeared to be looking away from the direction they were coming from,\" said Miss McCormack. \"But PC Whiteley was later to tell an officer investigating the case that she had glanced in his direction and he had assumed that, because he had his sirens on, she would have seen him.\" Miss McCormack said although he slowed, Miss McDonald was struck by the front passenger side of the van, which braked, carried on a few yards and stopped. \"But it had to be reversed to free her from the van,\" she said. Paulo Canaccuti, who saw the accident, told the court: \"They were travelling really fast at around 40 to 45mph, I guess.\" PC Malcolm Cumberlidge, an accident reconstruction specialist, said Whiteley had been driving too close to the centre of the road. \"The vehicle should have been slightly further to the right of the road, which would have been a safer distance. This would have given him more time to avoid pedestrians,\" he told the court. He added that the driver was travelling at a considerable speed, but from studies of the accident it was clear he had slowed considerably at the time of the accident. Miss McDonald will not be giving evidence, but in a statement said she had been returning from a lecture in Piccadilly, where she had drunk two glasses of wine. The case continues today.",

Even more authorities would be willing to appoint somebody with a record of assault, and a majority would accept a candidate convicted of drink-driving, according to the study. Only three of 118 authorities surveyed would reject an applicant on grounds of a previous conviction for possession of cannabis, even though official guidance on recruitment says drug offences should give rise to concern. The study was carried out by Joanne Smith, senior lecturer in social work at Plymouth university. She said the findings revealed alarming inconsistency and showed a need for the government to set clearer guidelines to protect the rights of both children and ex-offenders. \"At the moment, you could tell people with certain offences to their name: 'Don't apply here, here and here, because they won't accept you. But do apply here, here and here',\" Ms Smith said yesterday. The study, reported in the January issue of Professional Social Work, the journal of the British Association of Social Workers, involved interviews with those responsible for making decisions in cases where a social work job applicant has a criminal record. Ms Smith put forward hypothetical cases ranging from two convictions for shoplifting to one for indecent assault on a child. Recruiters, who were told that the applicants were suitable in every other respect, could ask for details of the offences and the candidate's explanation for them. Of the 118 authorities in England and Wales which took part, 85% said they would be prepared to appoint somebody convicted of house burglary or of causing actual bodily harm, 74% would accept a candidate convicted of indecent exposure, and 57% would appoint somebody found to have driven under the influence of alcohol. Yet only 32% would approve an applicant with a fraud conviction. In what Ms Smith described as an \"astonishing\" finding, six authorities were prepared to offer a job to somebody convicted of indecent assault on a child - five of them because the supposed offence had occurred more than 20 years previously and one because of its nature. The offence, which the mythical candidate still denied, was said to have happened while he was playing with the eight-year-old daughter of a friend. The sixth authority decided it \"probably wouldn't happen again\". Ms Smith said the six authorities had been interviewed in the early stages of her research, before publicity surrounding the conviction of foster parent Roger Saint for indecent assault on boys placed in his care despite a previous conviction. No authority interviewed after the Saint case had said it would accept the candidate with an indecent assault record. However, Ms Smith said there was still \"nothing to stop\" an authority doing so. The fictional case which provoked the most divided views among authorities was that of a woman applicant with two shoplifting convictions: 54% of authorities said they would appoint her and 46% said they would not. A key factor for many authorities was that the woman was said to have failed to disclose one of the offences - a sign of dishonesty which, as with the fraud conviction, was widely felt to rule her out even though it bore no direct relevance to the job. Ian Johnston, BASW director, said some of the concerns raised by the research would be addressed by the regulatory body for social workers, proposed in the government's care standards bill. \"It's a complex issue because we believe that people should not necessarily be debarred from the profession for life,\" Mr Johnston said. \"On the other hand, the protection of children and vulnerable adults must be the primary concern.\"",

      "bodyText": "Two decades of Conservative rule left Britain with the worst poverty record in the developed world, according to figures produced last night by the west's leading economic think thank. Poverty affected 20% of the British population a year on average between 1991 and 1996, said the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. During the six years of the study, 38% of the population spent at least one year below the poverty line. In the US, which has the next worst record, the average proportion of the population facing poverty each year was 14%, and the proportion spending at least one year below the poverty line was 26%. The British government has vowed to abolish child poverty within a generation, but a report from the Joseph Rowntree foundation in December suggested that so far it has had little impact on widening inequality, one of the factors which drove the rise in poverty under the Tories. The OECD's findings challenge the commonly held view that the world's largest economy also suffers from the most ingrained deprivation. Britain performed worse than the US on every count - average poverty rates, long-term poverty rates and the proportion who experienced poverty at some point over the six years. \"This report shows the chal lenge of worklessness and poverty that this government inherited,\" a treasury spokesman said. \"It also supports the government's approach that the best way out of poverty is to get people off welfare into work and to make work pay.\" The OECD research found that gaining employment was the main factor in reducing the length of time spent in poverty in all the countries in the study. Poverty affected 10% of the population on average in Germany, while in Sweden and the Netherlands the figures were 7.4% and 6.1% respectively. Britain not only had the highest average poverty rates over the period of the study, it also had the worst problem with long-term poverty. Using panel data which enabled researchers to track people's incomes over time, the OECD research showed that 6.1% of people in Britain were below the poverty line for all six years, while in the US the proportion was 4.6%. Long-term poverty is virtually unknown in the rest of Europe. In the Netherlands, less than 1% of the population suffered poverty for the entire six years of the study, while in Sweden and Germany the proportion was under 2%. Unemployment has fallen by nearly a million since the OECD study was conducted, which could have significantly reduced the numbers below the poverty line in Britain. However, the shrinking jobless queues will not help lift retired people out of poverty and the OECD research shows that Britain has more elderly poor than any other country in the west. Britain's social welfare system plays a vital role in lifting families out of poverty, according to the OECD. Without the safety net of benefits, the numbers below the poverty line would have been even higher - with one in three people experiencing poverty on average and more than half the population dipping below the poverty line at some point in the six years of the study.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of guests who spent much of New Year's Eve queuing at a tube station in east London trying to reach the Millennium Dome's opening party are to receive compensation for the delay, it was announced yesterday. All 6,500 people who travelled from Stratford station will be offered a free dome visit, a souvenir brochure and vouchers worth \u00a315 to be spent on food, drink and merchandise at the attraction in Greenwich. \"We recognise that many people coming through Stratford on New Year's Eve did not arrive in time to see the zones,\" Jennie Page, the chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company, said. \"The ticket vouchers we are providing mean they will be able to come back, with their guests, and see the zones and the millennium show in happier times.\" The chaos at Stratford was the first of what has turned out be a series of public relations disasters since the dome opened. Some of the zones have experienced long queues, while others have been criticised for a lack of imagination, irritating visitors and sponsors. Three thousand people were delayed at Stratford, but the offer is open to everyone who travelled via the station, the company said. Delays in sending out invitations by post meant many guests had to pick up their tickets at Stratford, adding to the chaos created by the need for everyone to pass through a security checkpoint at the station. NMEC said the voucher scheme would cost \u00a3130,000. In a letter to all the Stratford guests, Ms Page wrote: \"On behalf of NMEC, and everyone involved in these arrangements, I would like to offer our most sincere apologies for the problems you experienced.\" Tony Blair and a number of cabinet and shadow cabinet ministers escaped the mayhem at Stratford by travelling to the dome by tube from Westminster with 50 award-winners and their guests.",

      "bodyText": "The former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet is to be sent home next week after a series of medical tests found that he was unfit to stand trial, the home office announced last night. In a move that will horrify human rights campaigners, Jack Straw, the home secretary, said he was \"minded not to extradite\" Pinochet in the light of the medical evidence. In a statement, the home office said the \"unequivocal and unanimous\" conclusion of a four-strong medical team who examined Pinochet on January 5 was that he was \"at present unfit to stand trial, and that no change to that position can be expected\". It added: \"In the circumstances, the secretary of state is minded, subject to any representations he may receive, to take the view that no purpose would be served by continuing the present extradition proceedings and that he should therefore decide not to extradite Senator Pinochet.\" Mr Straw is to give the Spanish authorities, who are seeking Pinochet's extradition, seven days to raise objections. Home office sources indicated last night that Pinochet would be sent home next week. One source said: \"Pinochet will be going back to Chile rapidly after the seven-day deadline is over.\" Last week the team of senior doctors spent more than six hours examining the former Chilean dictator, who is wanted on charges of torture, inside the Northwick Park NHS hospital in Harrow. The results of the tests were not expected to be known for three weeks. It was accepted that if the doctors found the 84-year-old was as ill as his supporters claimed it would pave the way for Mr Straw to send him back to Chile on humanitarian grounds. Pinochet was examined by a team led by two gerontologists and a neurologist. He is believed to be suffering from renal problems, possibly brought on by diabetes, a heart condition and a neurological condition, which has manifested itself in three minor strokes. He is also said to be suffering from depression, brought on by his 16 months under house arrest.",

He should also withdraw from politics if he is allowed to return to Chile, they said. The news of his impending freedom came as \"a terrible blow\" at the headquarters of an organisation of relatives of dissidents who disappeared after being arrested during Gen Pinochet's 1973-90 regime. \"We deeply lament that health, humanitarian reasons may bring Pinochet back home,\" said Mireya Garcia, the vice-president of the Organisation of Relatives of Missing Detainees. \"This is very bad news for Chile and for justice.\" \"We believe that, although Pinochet is indeed very old and has problems, he was in shape to stand trial,\" she said. \"We no longer can expect that justice can be served in any country, when it comes to this kind of crime.\" Across town, at the Pinochet Foundation, a private group of Pinochet supporters and former aides, the reaction was one of joy. \"Are you sure?\" an official asked when told the news. \"This is simply wonderful.\" Retired army General Rafael Villarroel, a former close aide to Gen Pinochet, said: \"This is going to be good for Chile, for our fatherland, because a process starts to restore its sovereignty and dignity.\" Alberto Cardemil, a congressman and close associate of Gen Pinochet, described the British decision as \"a victory for a national cause\". The British government made its announcement after receiving a report by a team of four doctors who examined gen Pinochet last week at the request of the Chilean government. The doctors unanimously agreed that Gen Pinochet was \"at present unfit to stand trial,\" the Home Office announcement said. Gen Pinochet has been in police custody in London for almost 14 months at the request of Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon, who wants to try him for the human rights abuses during his regime. The reactions to the British announcement reflected a deep division in Chile. \"Unfortunately, this may be the end of a process that had triggered hopes among us and around the world that justice could be found in any country for crimes against human rights,\" said Ms Garcia. Julia Urquieta, a prominent human rights lawyer, also expressed frustration, calling the British decision \"lamentable.\" But, she added, \"We will continue to pursue justice. If he comes back, he must face justice here.\" There are more than 50 lawsuits against Gen Pinochet pending in the Chilean courts.

In October last year London magistrates decided there was nothing to stop him being extradited to Spain. That decision, inevitably, attracted another appeal from Gen Pinochet's lawyers that was due to be heard later this year - but which may now prove irrelevant. Dismay No doubt last night's decision will cause dismay among those who were pinning their hopes on seeing a man regarded as a brutal dictator brought to trial on the legal action sparked by Spain. But if they can take one crumb of comfort from what has happened it will be that the man responsible for the deaths of more than 3,000 of his own citizens now knows how it feels to be wrenched away from his home and his country. Gen Pinochet may be destined to fly home, but his bruising encounter with a determined Spanish judge and the British courts have spelt out to human rights abusers around the world that international law is catching up with them. The case set a crucial precedent - that former heads of state cannot hide behind the concept of state immunity to avoid prosecution for crimes committed in office.

November 25 On his 83rd birthday, Law Lords overturn High Court decision and rule he is not immune. December 1 Pinochet moves to Surrey house. February 18 1999 It emerges that in November the Vatican made representations, apparently sympathetic to Pinochet, to foreign office. March 24 By a 6-1 majority, law lords again overturn high court decision giving Pinochet immunity (after his lawyer accuses Lord Hoffmann of possible bias because of link to Amnesty International) but they reduce the charges: Pinochet can be extradited only for torture and conspiracy to torture alleged to have been committed after December 8 1988, when International Torture Convention became binding on Spain, UK and Chile. April 15 Straw says there are no compassionate grounds to halt proceedings. April 16 New arrest warrant served on Pinochet. July 2 Pinochet has electro-cardiogram.

A source at Madrid's high court said that the British decision would be difficult to challenge. \"If it is a health problem, there are no legal or procedural arguments that can be made.\" Spain's centre-right government had backed an extradition request put forward by the investigating magistrate in the case, Baltazar Garzon, but ministers made it plain, in private, that they did not want to see Gen Pinochet tried in their country. State prosecutors tried to find loopholes in the judge's case while Spain's foreign min ister tried to repair relations with Chile and several other Latin American countries, strained to breaking point by what they saw as unjustified interference from the former colonial power. The issue also divided the Spanish left. The Socialist party was strongly in favour of trying the general but a former prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, said it was not appropriate for a country which had handled its own transition to democracy by blocking out the past to interfere in the Chilean process. Lawyers representing victims of Gen Pinochet's regime, who pushed to bring a case against him, said last night that they needed to study the reports from London before deciding on their next move. But Spanish legal experts said it was unlikely that Mr Garzon could prevent Gen Pinochet being sent back to Chile if the Spanish government was unwilling to press its extradition bid. Joan Garces - a lawyer and former aide to late Chilean president Salvador Allende - who worked for years to build a case against the general, has insisted that he is not involved in a vendetta and that, morally, Gen Pinochet has already been condemned. But he also stressed that with several international detention orders outstanding, Gen Pinochet would remain a fugitive from international justice even if he returned to Chile as a free man. Carlos Seploy, another lawyer who is representing Pinochet victims, denounced a possible decision to send him back to Chile as \"a very grave error\". \"History will recount that the British government allowed Pinochet to return to Chile and remain immune,\" he said. His colleague Enrique Santiago added that they would ask the national court, which brought the case against the general in Spain, to request another round of medical tests be carried out on the general in Britain. \"It is not appropriate or just for Gen Pinochet to return to Chile without appearing before the Spanish courts which should decide whether he is guilty or innocent,\" he said. An Argentinian human rights lawyer, Carlos Slepoy, who aided the Spanish investigation of Gen Pinochet, said that the reported health problems should not lead to his release. Proceedings should be suspended but the general should remain held under house arrest until his condition improves, Mr Slepoy said. \"What justice demands is that Pinochet be tried. He is accused of horrible crimes.\" Mr Garzon's request for Gen Pinochet to be extradited on charges of murder, genocide and torture dating from 1973 to 1990 received official backing from the Spanish government in November 1998. After two controversial hearings the British law lords limited the period for which he could be tried, saying he had immunity until 1998, severely weakening Mr Garzon's case. Mr Garzon was not available for comment last night. Switzerland and France have also put in extradition requests and legal moves against the general have begun in Belgium, Denmark and Sweden.",

The allegations will only add to the damage to the image of the Tories inflicted by the libel trials of the former ministers Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken and the resignation of Lord Archer from the London mayoral contest. The fresh investigation by the parliamentary authorities into Mrs Gorman's affairs is understood to be the main reason she failed to make the party's new shortlist for its mayoral candidate. The maverick MP for Billericay is also facing allegations of misleading Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner, when she was asked about any land deal in an investigation last year into other undeclared business interests. Last year she was ordered to apologise to the Commons after failing to declare two directorships and a property in south London. During that investigation she was questioned about overseas land deals by Dale Campbell Savours, Labour MP for Workington, when she appeared before the standards committee.

She was asked by Ms Filkin \"for the sake of completeness\" whether she now possessed \"any land or property other than any home used for personal residential purposes of you or your husband, which has a substantial value or from which substantial income is derived\". She was asked to declare any other shareholdings in any public or private company worth more than \u00a325,000.

      "body": "<p>In February 1963 Fleet Street crime reporters Reg Foster and Brendan Mulholland made history by being jailed. They had persisted in their refusal to disclose sources of information on their reporting of the Vassall spy case and were thus sentenced at the high court for contempt; the Daily Sketch's Foster was given three months for refusing to name one source and the Daily Mail's Mulholland got six months for refusing to reveal two.</p> <p>Reg, who has died aged 95, had come before Lord Radcliffe, chairman of the tribunal inquiring into the activities of John Vassall, the Admiralty clerk sentenced in 1962 to 18 years' imprisonment for selling secrets to the Soviet Union. During a Moscow posting, he was photographed at a homosexual party and blackmailed into spying. Reg, one of several journalists who gave evidence to Radcliffe about reports they had written on the case, was asked to say from what type of source he had obtained information about Vassall buying women's clothes in the West End. He refused.</p> <p>Reg was born in south London, and educated at Alleyn's School, Dulwich. He became a trainee on the South London Press and from 1924 to 1932 was on the Daily Mail, after which he joined the Daily Herald.</p> <p>During those years he earned the nickname \"Fireman Foster\", for his enthusiasm in reporting fires. He was aided by a relative in the fire service who tipped him off, explaining why he was the first reporter on the scene of the dramatic 1936 Crystal Palace blaze.</p> <p>This was the period when Fleet Street's circus of crime correspondents would go out of town for weeks pursuing big stories. Sometimes Reg was away for so long that he would send for his wife, Kate, whom he adored, to join him.</p> <p>He covered the big criminal cases, for the Mail, the Herald, and later for the News Chronicle, which he joined after wartime army service. His cases included the 1949 acid bath murderer John George Haigh, and the 10 Rillington Place serial killer John Christie. He also reported the 1952 Craig and Bentley case, in which a policeman was shot dead and for which Derek Bentley was hanged, despite not having committed the murder.</p> <p>Reg was the News Chronicle's \"Yard man\", spending his time in the smoke-filled press room at old Scotland Yard, or hobnobbing in nearby pubs with police and contacts. As a Chronicle reporter, I only recall seeing the tall figure of Reg, ever unassuming and quietly-spoken, once a week when he called in to collect his expenses.</p> <p>After the Chronicle closed, Reg freelanced for the Sunday Dispatch, Sunday Express and Daily Mirror; then came the Sketch and the Vassall case. The two journalists were committed to Brixton Prison. On their first night there, Reg recalled later, he heard two other prisoners talking. \"Blimey,\" said one, \"someone's gone and put sugar in this cocoa.\" Replied the other: \"It must be because of those bloody reporters!\"</p> <p>Reg served most of his sentence at Ford Open Prison in Sussex, largely tending the gardens. At the age of 58 he also played in the prison football team. \"I couldn't run very fast, so they put me in goal,\" he recalled.</p> <p>Towards the end of his career, Reg worked for the Yorkshire Evening Post in its London office, and then retired to Pevensey Bay, East Sussex. But he always attended the News Chronicle's annual reunion.</p> <p>His wife died in 1984 after 53 years of marriage. Reg is survived by a son and a grandson.</p> <p><b> Matthew Engel writes:</b> Reg Foster was probably the last survivor of a Fleet Street that now no longer exists even in memory. When he joined the Daily Mail, there was - he recalled - \"a large panelled reporters' room with a phone with a handle on the wall, and a big roaring fire and a bell you could ring for boys who'd bring you beans on toast or marmalade on toast.

      "bodyText": "In February 1963 Fleet Street crime reporters Reg Foster and Brendan Mulholland made history by being jailed. They had persisted in their refusal to disclose sources of information on their reporting of the Vassall spy case and were thus sentenced at the high court for contempt; the Daily Sketch's Foster was given three months for refusing to name one source and the Daily Mail's Mulholland got six months for refusing to reveal two. Reg, who has died aged 95, had come before Lord Radcliffe, chairman of the tribunal inquiring into the activities of John Vassall, the Admiralty clerk sentenced in 1962 to 18 years' imprisonment for selling secrets to the Soviet Union. During a Moscow posting, he was photographed at a homosexual party and blackmailed into spying. Reg, one of several journalists who gave evidence to Radcliffe about reports they had written on the case, was asked to say from what type of source he had obtained information about Vassall buying women's clothes in the West End. He refused. Reg was born in south London, and educated at Alleyn's School, Dulwich. He became a trainee on the South London Press and from 1924 to 1932 was on the Daily Mail, after which he joined the Daily Herald. During those years he earned the nickname \"Fireman Foster\", for his enthusiasm in reporting fires. He was aided by a relative in the fire service who tipped him off, explaining why he was the first reporter on the scene of the dramatic 1936 Crystal Palace blaze. This was the period when Fleet Street's circus of crime correspondents would go out of town for weeks pursuing big stories. Sometimes Reg was away for so long that he would send for his wife, Kate, whom he adored, to join him. He covered the big criminal cases, for the Mail, the Herald, and later for the News Chronicle, which he joined after wartime army service. His cases included the 1949 acid bath murderer John George Haigh, and the 10 Rillington Place serial killer John Christie. He also reported the 1952 Craig and Bentley case, in which a policeman was shot dead and for which Derek Bentley was hanged, despite not having committed the murder. Reg was the News Chronicle's \"Yard man\", spending his time in the smoke-filled press room at old Scotland Yard, or hobnobbing in nearby pubs with police and contacts. As a Chronicle reporter, I only recall seeing the tall figure of Reg, ever unassuming and quietly-spoken, once a week when he called in to collect his expenses. After the Chronicle closed, Reg freelanced for the Sunday Dispatch, Sunday Express and Daily Mirror; then came the Sketch and the Vassall case. The two journalists were committed to Brixton Prison. On their first night there, Reg recalled later, he heard two other prisoners talking. \"Blimey,\" said one, \"someone's gone and put sugar in this cocoa.\" Replied the other: \"It must be because of those bloody reporters!\" Reg served most of his sentence at Ford Open Prison in Sussex, largely tending the gardens. At the age of 58 he also played in the prison football team. \"I couldn't run very fast, so they put me in goal,\" he recalled. Towards the end of his career, Reg worked for the Yorkshire Evening Post in its London office, and then retired to Pevensey Bay, East Sussex. But he always attended the News Chronicle's annual reunion. His wife died in 1984 after 53 years of marriage. Reg is survived by a son and a grandson. Matthew Engel writes: Reg Foster was probably the last survivor of a Fleet Street that now no longer exists even in memory. When he joined the Daily Mail, there was - he recalled - \"a large panelled reporters' room with a phone with a handle on the wall, and a big roaring fire and a bell you could ring for boys who'd bring you beans on toast or marmalade on toast. If the news editor wanted you, he's either ring the phone or he'd panic down the corridor with his coat-tails flying.\" Marmalade notwithstanding, journalism between the wars was not a gentle profession. Competition for news was fiercer than in any other era of the 20th century, and it bred an approach that would give modern editors kittens. Foster's world of crime reporting was probably the fiercest and most amoral of the lot. The star Scotland Yard detectives might go out of town on a juicy murder enquiry (like the Cheltenham Torso or the Brighton Trunk Murders) for weeks, pursued by Fleet Street's finest, who would be under pressure to keep the story going at any cost. \"Someone might find a bloodstained garter in a ditch,\" reminisced Foster, \"Marvellous story, but no relevance at all to the investigation . . . There was a certain amount of freedom of expression. I think I'd better leave it like that.\" This was the background that produced his reporting of the Vassall case, when he may have had a genuine scoop, or may just have used his freedom of expression. I think we had better leave it like that. Foster was a delightful, cheery man and a rich source of journalistic lore into extreme old age. In the days of bloodstained garters, when reporters all wore hats and grey macs, he must have been a charming colleague. Reginald William Foster, reporter, born July 23 1904; died December 29 1999",

      "bodyText": "Exactly a month ago today, 60 miles from the windswept dunes and white-painted, slate-roofed holiday villas of this neat Brittany village, a 24-year-old rusty Maltese oil tanker broke her back and sank in a midwinter gale. Two weeks later, in thick, foul-smelling black slabs, the Erika's cargo began washing up on the long pristine ribbon of Les Moutiers beach. And every day since Boxing Day, Guy le Pavec has been cleaning it up. The deputy mayor of Les Moutiers, grey-haired and crinkle-faced, looked at the scene with tired eyes. Four bulldozers were at work, digging out a fresh mountain of sludge that had arrived with the morning tide. \"It's desperate\", Mr le Pavec said. \"Every day we break our backs, and every morning we come back wondering how much of yesterday's work will have been undone. But you can't let it get you down. You just have to keep going.\" It is revolting stuff, heavy fuel oil.

      "bodyText": "Women must be allowed to carry arms in the German military, the European court of justice ruled yesterday in a landmark decision that said single-sex combat forces violated European Union equality regulations. The Luxembourg-based court upheld a complaint from a German woman, Tanja Kreil, whose efforts to join the Bundeswehr had been rejected because Germany's post-war constitution specifically bans women from using weapons. \"German legislation barring women outright from army jobs involving the use of arms is contrary to the [European] community principle of equal treatment for men and women,\" the court said. Constitutional change could now follow, but women commandos and snipers are not yet heading for battle: the court said exceptions remain possible where sex constitutes \"a determining factor for access to certain special combat units\" - an easy get-out for generals and governments. Ms Kreil, 23, who trained in electronics and now works at Siemens AG, applied to join up in 1996, but her application was rejected, though she still hopes to work with tanks. \"It is a tremendous relief to me,\" she said of the decision. \"I am very proud that I accomplished this.\" Ms Kreil said she was astonished three years ago when her application was rejected solely because she was a woman. \"It made me feel like I was living in the Middle Ages,\" she told the newspaper Tageszeitung. Germany's armed forces have fewer women than any other Nato member, with 4,340 medical staff and 60 musicians - the only jobs they are allowed to do. All German men are required to serve 10 months in the armed forces after turning 18, athough conscientious objectors may do community service instead. Yesterday's ruling has sweeping implications for Germany's conscript army, long battered by complaints of discrimination against women and gay men, but buoyed by its first overseas combat deployment in Kosovo last year. Experts believe Germany may now have to change its constitution. Even during the desperate days of the second world war, when young teenagers and elderly men were pressed into service by the Nazis, women were exempted from combat duty. Verena Wohlleben, a military expert with Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats, said the government would examine whether it could integrate women in the armed forces without changing the constitution, but she believed a change was desirable.

      "bodyText": "After turning a deaf ear to domestic and international protests, the United States yesterday executed Chris Thomas, who was a juvenile when he committed the crimes for which he was put to death. Thomas was executed by lethal injection at the Greensville Correctional Centre in Virginia on Monday night after a last-minute petition for a stay of execution was rejected by the state governor, Jim Gilmore. The 26-year-old prisoner was pronounced dead at 9.03pm local time, less than an hour after Mr Gilmore had refused to commute his sentence to life imprisonment without parole. Earlier in the day, the US Supreme Court had also refused to grant a stay. Thomas, who was 17 when he killed his girlfriend's parents in November 1990, was the first of three American prisoners due to die this month for crimes committed when they were juveniles. Only a handful of other nations allow capital punishment for juvenile crime. A second man, Steve Roach, 23, is scheduled to be executed tomorrow, also in Virginia. Roach was 17 when he killed 70-year-old Mary Hughes, in her home in Stanardsville, Virginia, in December 1993. In a third case, Texan Glen McGinnis, who was 27 yesterday, is due to be executed on January 25 for the 1990 killing of a laundry attendant. McGinnis was also 17 at the time of his offence. The three executions will bring to 13 the number of juvenile criminals who have been executed in the past decade in the US, more than all other countries combined during the same period, according to Amnesty. Aside from the US, only four other countries currently allow the execution of juvenile offenders - Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Yemen, the only other nation to have carried out an execution of this type since 1990, has subsequently abolished the practice, as has China. Thomas's execution came despite official pleas for clemency from the European Union and many US groups, including the American Bar Association and the Rutherford Institute, a conservative legal foundation. The planned executions had been denounced by campaigners against capital punishment. \"To have three scheduled executions of juveniles in the first month of the new year is a morbid alert to the people of this country to re-examine the vengeful nature of our juvenile justice system,\" said Sam Jordan, who directs the death penalty abolition programme of Amnesty International USA. \"There should be a national alarm at the use of this desperate, ineffective and failed response,\" he said In an unusually long statement which appeared to reflect the sensitive nature of the case, Mr Gilmore denied Thomas's request for last-minute clemency on the grounds that the prisoner's responsibility under the law was \"not diminished because of legal protections afforded to his 14-year-old accomplice\". Mr Thomas's girlfriend, 14-year-old Jessica Wiseman, was also convicted as an accomplice in the killing of her parents, and was sentenced to imprisonment in a youth centre until she turned 21. She was released in 1997. \"Indeed, in a society where the incidence of youth violence has increased, we must continue to demand complete accountability for such terrible crimes,\" Mr Gilmore said. Roach has also submitted a petition for clemency to Mr Gilmore but, unlike Thomas, his lawyers have not attempted to get the US Supreme Court to intervene. The case involving McGinnis, who is black, will focus renewed attention on the capital punishment stance of the Texas governor George W Bush, the frontrunner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination this year. Texas currently has 28 prisoners who were juveniles at the time of their offences on death row - 12 of them are black, 12 are Latino, and four are white.",

The accident is bound to attract fresh criticism of safety procedures in South Africa's mines, which claim an average of one life every day and are considered to be among the most dangerous in the world. The 15 miners became stranded on Monday after an earth tremor caused a rock fall at the African Rainbow Minerals (ARM) gold shaft in Orkney, about 100 miles south-west of Johannesburg. Rescue teams cut tunnels to ease the flow of air to the area where the men are trapped, but it was feared that temperatures the other side of the rock fall had risen to about 40C (104F). Attempts to contact the miners failed. Andre Wilkens, the chief executive of ARM, which was recently bought by a \"black empowerment\" company, said the rescuers had dislodged 160 tons of rock but were making slow progress. \"Rescue workers have cleared the steep travelling way into the working area where the miners are trapped,\" he said. \"They are now clearing down towards the miners and have progressed some three metres, but have encountered some difficulty in getting to them.\" Another rescue team is attempting to reach the men by an alternative route beneath the rock fall. Four of the trapped miners are South African. The others are from Swaziland, Lesotho and Mozambique. Compared with other countries, safety procedures are poor in South African mines, a legacy of the apartheid era, when the loss of black lives mattered only because it hindered production. More than 70,000 miners - almost all of them black - died and 1m were injured in accidents last century. It is estimated that one life was lost for every ton of gold extracted. Five years ago, 104 miners died at Vaal Reefs mine when a locomotive used to haul coal fell down a mine shaft and crushed a cage carrying men about to start the night shift. The industry claims its safety record has improved in recent years, but that is against a backdrop of a massive shrinkage in the workforce from 400,000 men five years ago to little more than half of that now. Mine owners argue that because South Africa's gold is embedded deep in hard rock it more difficult and dangerous to extract than in other countries. Many shafts are also plagued by earth tremors brought on by mining itself. But most mining companies claim they cannot afford early warning systems for rock falls - standard equipment in Australia and the United States. The unions argue that the industry still puts profits ahead of lives, and many mines lack sufficient numbers of inspectors and training programmes. South Africa signed an international mining safety convention two months ago.",

      "bodyText": "In our brief item, Villagers break away from UK, page 12, January 8, we said The People's Republic of Ashurst Wood Nation State justified its action in declaring independence because \"King Ethelred granted the village immunity from taxation in 1164...\" The last King Ethelred of England - Ethelred II \"The Unready\" - died in 1016. King Henry II was on the throne in 1164. The author of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the book behind the film Sleepy Hollow, pages 12 and 13, G2 yesterday, was Washington Irving, not Irvine. The hill in East Lothian referred to in our report about UFO activity, page 20, January 10, is North Berwick Law (rather than just Berwick Law). It stands above the coastal village of North Berwick. The hotel mentioned in our report about Gibraltar's influx of bookmakers, page 27, January 6, is the Eliott (rather than Elliott). It is named after Lord Heathfield of Gibraltar (George Augustus Eliott) who became governor of Gibraltar in 1775 and defended it against Spain in the great siege of 1779-83. He was given his title in 1787 (Hutchinson Encyclopedia). The people of Gibraltar are known as Gibraltarians, not Gibraltans.

      "body": "<p>Christmas shoppers might have been clearing the shelves of the big retailers, as their figures showed yesterday, but they were not paying enough for their goods to make life happy for all the stores' shareholders. </p> <p>Shares in Kingfisher tumbled by more than 14% as the group, which owns Comet, B&amp;Q, Superdrug and Woolworths, said that prices were under continuing pressure. </p> <p>From one end of the price spectrum to the other - department store Selfridges, which bills itself as the \"House of Brands\" to out-of-town discount fashion specialists Matalan - yesterday's Christmas sales figures were better than had been predicted. </p> <p>Seasonal sales figures were robust for Kingfisher's outlets too, but they were accompanied by a warning that profit margins were under pressure and that costs were increasing. </p> <p>Kingfisher's chief executive, Sir Geoff Mulcahy, said that the group's like-for-like sales, which exclude the effect of new shopfloor space, were up 6% on 1998 levels in the last nine weeks of 1999. Total sales, which incorporate the impact of new selling space, were ahead by 30.8%. </p> <p>He said that, while attempts to keep down prices had put profit margins under pressure, \"we are pleased with our performance\". </p> <p>Kingfisher had incurred \"additional significant costs\" in the last few months connected with e-commerce developments, which were now expected to total \u00a321m, compared to the \u00a310 estimated previously. </p> <p>Sir Geoff said: \"Competition in the retail sector gets tougher year by year. Margins have been coming down for several years and that isn't going to change soon.\" He pinpointed Comet and Superdrug as having the toughest time on prices. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Kingfisher nevertheless insisted that the impact on margins had been small, and focused on a few products, such as mobile phones. She said: \"We are not seeing anything here that is unexpected\". </p> <p>The warning was still unexpected, analysts claimed. They immediately recalculated their profit forecasts for the company, slashing some \u00a350m off their expectations for the full year. </p> <p>Kingfisher's shares fell 95p to close at 578p, their biggest ever one-day drop. \"It came as a genuine surprise,\" said Robert Miller, retail analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. \"They have lost around half a percentage point in gross margin in the second half.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere, Matalan shares leaped after the company, which is still 60% owned by its founder, John Hargreaves, said its like-for-like sales in the five weeks to January 1 had been ahead 19.5% on last year and margins were also improving. Its shares, which came to the market only two years ago at 235p, are now changing hands at 1935, up 70p yesterday. One analyst said that despite the rapid ascent the shares remained \"exciting\". </p> <p>Selfridges, which now trades from a Manchester outlet as well as its London store in Oxford Street, similarly reported better than expected sales, up 12.9% in the six weeks to January 8; most analysts had forecast growth of less than 10%. The shares rose 6p to a new high of 295p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Christmas shoppers might have been clearing the shelves of the big retailers, as their figures showed yesterday, but they were not paying enough for their goods to make life happy for all the stores' shareholders. Shares in Kingfisher tumbled by more than 14% as the group, which owns Comet, B&amp;Q, Superdrug and Woolworths, said that prices were under continuing pressure. From one end of the price spectrum to the other - department store Selfridges, which bills itself as the \"House of Brands\" to out-of-town discount fashion specialists Matalan - yesterday's Christmas sales figures were better than had been predicted. Seasonal sales figures were robust for Kingfisher's outlets too, but they were accompanied by a warning that profit margins were under pressure and that costs were increasing. Kingfisher's chief executive, Sir Geoff Mulcahy, said that the group's like-for-like sales, which exclude the effect of new shopfloor space, were up 6% on 1998 levels in the last nine weeks of 1999. Total sales, which incorporate the impact of new selling space, were ahead by 30.8%. He said that, while attempts to keep down prices had put profit margins under pressure, \"we are pleased with our performance\". Kingfisher had incurred \"additional significant costs\" in the last few months connected with e-commerce developments, which were now expected to total \u00a321m, compared to the \u00a310 estimated previously. Sir Geoff said: \"Competition in the retail sector gets tougher year by year. Margins have been coming down for several years and that isn't going to change soon.\" He pinpointed Comet and Superdrug as having the toughest time on prices. A spokeswoman for Kingfisher nevertheless insisted that the impact on margins had been small, and focused on a few products, such as mobile phones. She said: \"We are not seeing anything here that is unexpected\". The warning was still unexpected, analysts claimed. They immediately recalculated their profit forecasts for the company, slashing some \u00a350m off their expectations for the full year. Kingfisher's shares fell 95p to close at 578p, their biggest ever one-day drop. \"It came as a genuine surprise,\" said Robert Miller, retail analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. \"They have lost around half a percentage point in gross margin in the second half.\" Elsewhere, Matalan shares leaped after the company, which is still 60% owned by its founder, John Hargreaves, said its like-for-like sales in the five weeks to January 1 had been ahead 19.5% on last year and margins were also improving. Its shares, which came to the market only two years ago at 235p, are now changing hands at 1935, up 70p yesterday. One analyst said that despite the rapid ascent the shares remained \"exciting\". Selfridges, which now trades from a Manchester outlet as well as its London store in Oxford Street, similarly reported better than expected sales, up 12.9% in the six weeks to January 8; most analysts had forecast growth of less than 10%. The shares rose 6p to a new high of 295p.",

Michelin to cut 473 jobs in Stoke French tyre-maker Michelin said yesterday it needed to cut 473 jobs to secure the long-term future of its plant at Stoke-on-Trent in Britain. Michelin said the cuts would primarily affect the car tyre and tyre component production workshops. The plant, which employs 2,700 people, will receive an \u00a311m investment to update its buildings and equipment. More firms go broke in 1999 Company insolvencies jumped nearly 7% last year, despite the strong economic upturn, with London and the south-east showing particularly large increases, figures showed yesterday. A total of 1,480 receivership and administration orders were made during the year, compared with 1,384 in 1998. The worst-hit sectors were manufacturing - where insolvencies went from 444 in 1998 to 496 last year - and so-called \"other services\" - including education, hairdressing, medical practice, sanitation and dry cleaning - where the total rose from 164 to 214. Exhausted fund manager rests The fund manager of Jupiter's top-rated Income unit trust, William Littlewood, yesterday shocked investors by stepping aside from day-to-day control of the \u00a31.5bn fund. Mr Littlewood, 32, who has managed the fund since 1991 and is believed to be in line for a \u00a310m bonus, says he is suffering from exhaustion.",

There may be delays in the re-opening of the Royal Court in London, but the Manchester Royal Exchange and Birmingham Rep continue to produce new plays. The National may have had a few unfortunate experiences, but that's no reason to under-rate the popular Battle Royal. The Royal Shakespeare Company, for which I work, is sometimes criticised for not putting its big new plays on to its biggest stages - but think about the pragmatics of planning a largely classical repertoire, and you'll understand why we mainly perform Shakespeare in our huge auditoria, while deploying living writers right across all our venues. If there is going to be a crisis in new playwriting, then it will be caused by a lack of perspective. </p> <p>As well as misreading the circumstances, I think we have a distorted view of what constituted successful new playwriting in the 90s. We tend to agree unthinkingly when we're told that the 90s was about sex and violence, shopping and fucking. When Sarah Kane's Blasted opened, it didn't matter that relatively few got to see it during its limited run at the Theatre Upstairs - its succ\u00e8s de scandale was welcomed with glee. Theatre was controversial, on the news-stands, fashionable, young - \"nihilistic urban chic\", the critic John Lahr dubbed it.

Mutilated paedophiliac fantasies, self-portraits made from greasy fried-egg breasts and rancid kebab vaginas - the Royal Academy called its retrospective of these Hackney horrors Sensation! However honest the intention of the artist, here was a commercial collection appropriated by the Establishment to shock effect. So when a play like Patrick Marber's brilliant Closer came along, it was seized upon as further evidence of solipsistic 90s nihilism. The seminal scene of viciously lonely sex-talk on the internet was crassly taken by some to epitomise a zeitgeist. At the same time, the works of other young male writers, such as Nick Grosso and Joe Penhall, were being marketed for the testosterone-fuelled lad-mags. </p> <p>The glossy print has left a nasty smear. Now we're in danger of overlooking the sensitivity of the work we praised at the time - remember Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy, remember The Herbal Bed? - and that should characterise the 90s. The most important perspective to have is of the humanity of the playwrights, the civilising force of their language, the poetic sensibility of those plays. </p> <p>Marber's first play, the painfully funny Dealer's Choice, shows a sensitive yearning for father-son relationships precisely because of its Mametesque, gambling-table machismo. There were also the life-enhancing gay plays: the emotionally uplifting Beautiful Thing; Kevin Elyot's exquisitely structured, deeply moving My Night With Reg. At the same time, British playwrights rediscovered experimental theatre: Martin Crimp's deft Attempts on Her Life; Caryl Churchill's mischievous Blue Heart.

In England, we're blessed by poetic voices arriving from abroad, such as Nigeria's Biyi Bandele (his verse reinvention of Aphra Behn's Restoration novella Oroonoko, currently at the Pit Theatre, is a marvel) and New York's Phyllis Nagy, and by other women's witty voices such as April de Angelis or Moira Buffini. </p> <p>The new wave was a fierce wave, sure, but in a vaster, calmer ocean of poetic new writing.

The woman licks the man's hand and, in turn, he tries to bite hers. Soon they are gobbling each other up, rolling fully clothed on the floor, consuming each other. You have never seen anything so erotic and so greedy - they cannot get enough of each other. Suddenly they both sit up and burp like two kids pigged out on cake. </p> <p>This is the start of Deadly, a 60-minute piece of almost wordless physical theatre played out to a range of music that moves from classical to techno, as it whizzes through the seven deadly sins within the framework of a volatile, sometimes abusive relationship. The audience witnesses the highs and lows - literally - as Deborah Pope and Rodrigo Matheus swing through the air in ecstasy, their sometimes almost naked, muscular bodies entwined. At other times they trample upon each other in utter contempt. The two dancers combine the skill of aerialists with the expressiveness of actors. </p> <p>Deadly is a rare and perfect union between circus and narrative, and after wowing audiences in Edinburgh last summer it arrives in London this week as part of the London International Mime Festival. It is perfect timing, just when the opening performance at the Dome has made audiences aware of aerial work. It is suddenly the art form of the moment. </p> <p>Deborah Pope, a New Zealander, arrived in London as a medical student 20 years ago. She enrolled in an acrobatics workshop for fun, later learning most of her circus skills from ex-vaudeville star Eugene Balla, who at 89 is still teaching circus hopefuls in his Brixton living room. Pope was responsible for training the aerialists for the Dome, and believes that audiences can't fail to fall for their performances. </p> <p>\"There is something very sexy about aerial work,\" she says. \"The air is omnipotent and anyone who can fly is powerful and dangerous. The moment you put a performance in the air you raise the stakes. Then, of course, there are all those muscled, androgynous bodies that are so fashionable at the moment.\" </p> <p> Part of the appeal of Deadly is its mixture of confidence and eroticism. The way that Pope and Matheus interact with one another, their bodies almost becoming one, is enormously sensual, as is the way that the safety of each is so entirely dependent on the strength and skill of the other. In fact, the whole piece is startlingly beautiful: at one point shafts of golden glitter fall from the air and smother Pope's body in a kind of benediction. </p> <p>But there is also something disturbing about the piece. It gets pretty near to the heart of the balance of power that exists in every relationship, and it explores how, in some relationships, particularly passionate sexual ones, love and hate can co-exist. The couple in Deadly remind you of Adam and Eve, but the apple here is rotten to the core. </p> <p>Beyond the surface eroticism, something deeply painful is taking place. There is a troubling sadism in the way these two hurt each other - particularly in the way he hurts her. Unsurprisingly, some women who have experienced abusive relationships have found Deadly almost unbearable to watch. </p> <p>Pope believes the piece \"makes a bigger statement by making no statement\", instead depicting the relationship as a never-ending circle. \"I think we were aware of the responsibility when making Deadly,\" she says. \"It tries to be honest. It is the rawness that some people find difficult to deal with.\" She also says that she wouldn't want a child to see it. </p> <p>A huge element of Deadly's success is the way that each daring physical feat has metaphorical meaning far beyond the mere fact of its skill, but the piece also works as more than a simple dissection of an affair. </p> <p>When the show played the Latin American festival at Cadiz in Spain, political refugees from South America were shocked by the undercurrent of violence in the piece, saying it reminded them strongly of the power-plays and physical and mental intimidation they had experienced in their own countries. I am not entirely surprised. When I saw Deadly in Edinburgh I was struck by similarities to Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden. </p> <p>With Deadly likely to cause something of a sensation in London, and the Dome raising the profile of aerial work, audiences may have to get used to the idea of looking upwards for their entertainment. But Pope thinks this is wishful thinking and that Britain still has a lot of catching up to do in the field of aerial entertainment. </p> <p>\"People can now get the training. But there is no funding to create work and, worse still, no circuit to perform it on. Emerging countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada are still far in advance of Britain. Progress is slow because the spoken word and literary text are so privileged here. But the profile is changing and I think what we seeing at the Dome is a response to that.\" </p> <p>It does seem likely that Deadly will prove inspirational for the next generation of aerialists. \"I don't think the kind of fusion between circus and theatre that you see in Deadly is as far as it can go. But creating pieces like that takes a lot of time,\" says Pope. She pauses. \"Earlier this year I did an installation circus. It was a cross between the big top, Damien Hirst and live art. It was brilliant. Maybe that's the future.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Deadly is at the Guildhall Arts Centre, Gloucester (01452 505089), tomorrow and the Purcell Room, London SE1 (0171-960 4242), from January 15-19 as part of the London International Mime Festival, then tours.</p>",

But the profile is changing and I think what we seeing at the Dome is a response to that.\" It does seem likely that Deadly will prove inspirational for the next generation of aerialists. \"I don't think the kind of fusion between circus and theatre that you see in Deadly is as far as it can go. But creating pieces like that takes a lot of time,\" says Pope. She pauses. \"Earlier this year I did an installation circus. It was a cross between the big top, Damien Hirst and live art. It was brilliant. Maybe that's the future.\" \u0095 Deadly is at the Guildhall Arts Centre, Gloucester (01452 505089), tomorrow and the Purcell Room, London SE1 (0171-960 4242), from January 15-19 as part of the London International Mime Festival, then tours.",

      "body": "<p>When George Carman QC walked into Manchester's Hacienda in 1991 to sort out the famous club's image problem (a small matter of drugs and gangs) his advice was simple: \"Gentlemen, shut that loudmouth up!\" </p> <p>The loudmouth was and is Tony Wilson. \"Greater Manchester police had correctly identified me as the Timothy Leary of Ecstasy,\" sighs Wilson, practising his best \"Who, me?\" shrug. For anyone in the Manchester area, Wilson is that silly-suited man who pops up on the telly as a Granada TV presenter. But for most of us he will always be the face, suit and mouth behind Factory Records. Wilson brought the world three of the 30 or so major acts in pop history. Joy Division, New Order and Happy Mondays were a pop triple-whammy once compared to \"winning the pools three times. Twice is a miracle, three times you call in the fraud squad.\" </p> <p>Now he's trying for number four. Wilson has a new arts/pop/interview series called Content; more intriguingly, he is also planning to revive his record label. His re-emergence coincides with his theory that the UK is on the brink of another major pop revolution. This, he says, happens once every 13 years and he knows the next one is around the corner because \"Top of the Pops looks like 1974 again, like it did in 1988. </p> <p>\"Sixty-three was the Beatles,\" he expands. \"Seventy-six the Sex Pistols. 1989 Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses. I never realised until recently that if you go back even further, that's 1950, the dawn of the teddy boy,\" he smiles. There's a twinkle in his eye that says, \"I am very clever.\" Then he actually says it. \"I am very clever.\" </p> <p>If Tony Wilson hadn't been such a clever so-and-so the entire course of British pop might not have been the same. A young Mancunian might never have gone up to him in 1977 and said \"You bastard! You put the Sex Pistols on the telly - what about us?\" Wilson was presenting a weekly arts programme then, So It Goes. The young man was Ian Curtis, and his band were Joy Division. Wilson used his savings to finance Joy Division's seminal debut album, Unknown Pleasures. From a tiny apartment in Didsbury, Manchester, Factory's bands changed the way pop sounded, while his label transformed the way it was sold. </p> <p>Wilson was a Cambridge-educated trade unionist and keen Situationist. His initial - then revolutionary - philosophy was that a record company could actually be geared to serve the people that recorded for it. Thus, Wilson pioneered the now indie-standard 50/50 profits split between label and artists, and the far more bold (and certainly not copied) \"non-contract contact\", which gave the workers ownership of their own products. \"That document that states 'We own nothing. The musicians own everything' in the end made Factory bankrupt, and resulted in my entire catalogue being owned by somebody else,\" says Wilson now. \"But I can't regret it, because the idea was not to own the past but to present the future.\" </p> <p>Wilson's equally crucial vision was that \"the pop record was sacred, so why not make it beautiful?\" Crafted by then unknown designer Peter Savile, Factory records boasted better-looking record sleeves than the wealthiest labels in the world. Factory refused to cheapen their immaculate products by conventional marketing, in the naive - but astonishingly successful - belief that \"If the record's good, it sells.\" </p> <p>Still, when Wilson finally used a radio plugger for New Order's 1983 Blue Monday, the result was the biggest-selling 12-inch of all time. </p> <p>For over a decade, Factory's aesthetic, sense of mischief and bands (\"lesser\" Factory groups included early OMD and James) dominated British youth culture, culminating in the Hacienda club, home of UK house music. And then it all went wrong. The UK's first Ecstasy death in Wilson's club gave his Learyesque proselytising a nasty aftertaste. Factory made millions by being pranksters, but spent it quickly: a reported \u00a3250,000 on an album by New Order bass player Peter Hook (\"It was \u00a3350,000\"); a borrowed \u00a3700,000 on a Ben Kelly-designed super-building, its value wiped out by the property crash as loan rates soared. Wilson laughs about what he calls the edifice complex - \"you make money, you build a new office, and you go bankrupt\" - but that's effectively what happened. </p> <p>\"Although Factory was always a precarious pile of shite, everything had to go wrong,\" he sighs. \"Happy Mondays had to discover crack cocaine in Barbados! New Order's album had to be two years late! Claire Leighton had to die, of a tablet bought in Stockport, but in the Hacienda! There had to be an international property collapse! Do you want me to go on?\" </p> <p>Factory went bankrupt on November 23, 1992. Since then, Wilson has been something of a lost soul. He struck a rescue deal with a major label, London Records, but the non-contract contract cut him off from his own bands. Both New Order and Happy Mondays now record for London. Wilson gets uncharacteristically emotional when talking about this - like a father who's lost his children - but insists he wouldn't change a thing. </p> <p>Wilson's Content series restores him to his favoured role as an arbiter of taste. He gets to choose all the new bands and his heroes (Malcolm McLaren, Marianne Faithfull, Irvine Welsh) appear on the shows but equally important, the new lease of life has re-ignited his sense of mischief. Now he's planning revenge. For the past few months, Wilson has been looking into MP3 (internet-based music retail) with partners based in Manchester. Like Creation's Alan McGee, Wilson is convinced that by being a trailblazer in the new technology, independents can again beat the majors at selling music, but Wilson believes he can do it more cheaply than any of them. A Factory offshoot at <a href=\"http://www.Music33.com\" target_new>www.Music33.com</a> will remove 70% of the costs of selling music. According to Wilson, online retail will triple sales of music and benefit public and artists alike. </p> <p>He says the public are tired of trawling around record shops to find albums \"like the Verve's, who have three good tracks and they're all the singles anyway,\" and plans to sell individual songs, without B-sides. He claims he will undercut other operators by as much as 30p a tune, meaning \"these shits charging 99p and then saying to the artists 'You can have so much per cent' can go screw themselves.\" </p> <p>According to Wilson, MP3 is the way people will buy music in the future, but unlike McGee, he is under no illusion that MP3 will mean the end of record companies. So, Factory will also resume operating as a record company. </p> <p>Typically, Wilson has had T-shirts printed with the words \"Alan, you're up your arse\". \"McGee has some very good ideas but he's completely wrong on this,\" says Wilson. \"It's like [Warner Brothers'] Rob Dickens said to me, 'MP3? It's just distribution. I've owned half a dozen warehouses in my life. Never visited one of them. Think they'll get rid of record companies? You know what the public wanna buy. They wanna buy songs. Guess who owns them. We do.' He's completely right.\" Unless, that is, the record company is Wilson's. But can the man who gave us those wonderful records all that time ago rediscover his Midas touch? Wilson stares me in the face and recalls a band whose tape he was particularly fond of playing in his car. They were perfect for Factory, all surly stares, damaged psyche and raging anthems. Sadly, Factory was going bankrupt and Wilson couldn't sign them. The band was Oasis. </p> <p>\"That was the summer of '92,\" he states, defiantly. \"Alan [McGee] didn't see them until spring '93.

      "body": "<p>England abandoned all pretence that they intend immediately to arrest their decline by embarking on an obsessive push for youth, when the Yorkshire all-rounder Craig White was named yesterday to replace the injured Andrew Flintoff for the one-day series against South Africa. </p> <p>White, 30, the possessor of a modest international record and ignored for two years, is the sort of tried and untrusted player that many populists demanded must be forever banished after England's plunge to the bottom of the Test rankings last summer. But the coach Duncan Fletcher and the captain Nasser Hussain have persistently indicated in the past month that they are set upon evolution not revolution. </p> <p>First there was Mark Ramprakash, called up as cover for the Cape Town Test when many wanted Worcestershire's young batsman Vikram Solanki to be rewarded for his success on the A tour in Bangladesh and New Zealand. Then Graeme Hick was asked to captain England on the conventional basis of seniority when Michael Vaughan, billed by some as a potential future England captain, might have relished the experience. </p> <p>Now England have turned to White, with Fletcher's reign as England coach showing such an affinity towards Yorkshiremen that Raymond Illingworth, observing from his Spanish villa, might wonder whether his own devotion was too discreet.

      "bodyText": "England abandoned all pretence that they intend immediately to arrest their decline by embarking on an obsessive push for youth, when the Yorkshire all-rounder Craig White was named yesterday to replace the injured Andrew Flintoff for the one-day series against South Africa. White, 30, the possessor of a modest international record and ignored for two years, is the sort of tried and untrusted player that many populists demanded must be forever banished after England's plunge to the bottom of the Test rankings last summer. But the coach Duncan Fletcher and the captain Nasser Hussain have persistently indicated in the past month that they are set upon evolution not revolution. First there was Mark Ramprakash, called up as cover for the Cape Town Test when many wanted Worcestershire's young batsman Vikram Solanki to be rewarded for his success on the A tour in Bangladesh and New Zealand. Then Graeme Hick was asked to captain England on the conventional basis of seniority when Michael Vaughan, billed by some as a potential future England captain, might have relished the experience. Now England have turned to White, with Fletcher's reign as England coach showing such an affinity towards Yorkshiremen that Raymond Illingworth, observing from his Spanish villa, might wonder whether his own devotion was too discreet. White is the fifth Yorkshire player called up by England this winter. \"We considered a number of possible alternatives, ranging from players who had performed well on the A tour to those still in South Africa,\" explained David Graveney, the chairman of selectors. \"Craig was our final choice because he had a good season for Yorkshire in one-day cricket last summer. He has been bowling well for Central Districts in New Zealand and also has experience of South African conditions.\" That experience came in a hectic series in South Africa three years ago when he played seven of his 15 England one-day matches, all overseas. His record is modest - 187 runs at 14.38 and 15 wickets at 29.67 - but his potential has never been fully realised and a new management team cannot entirely be blamed for believing they can unlock it. White's bowling will more than compensate for that of Flintoff, whose elephantine fast-medium has been overhyped and whose fractured left foot in the innings defeat in Cape Town, following quickly on his long-standing back ailment, was a predictable end to the tour for a talented batsman with a limited enthusiasm for bowling. White, selected ahead of Essex's Ronnie Irani, will fly from New Zealand to join the one-day party in Bloemfontein tomorrow prior to the opening one-day international against South Africa on Sunday week. He offers England variety, Yorkshire having employed him both as a pinch-hitting batsman and a blockhole bowler for the closing overs.

Tudor did knock the top off the innings with two early wickets to go with one for Mullally, as well as sending James Bryant to hospital by striking him on the left arm.

Ontong followed in the next over for 34 and Wendell Bossenger three overs later right on the tea interval. </p> <p>With the home side's lead only 63 at that stage, England still nursed hopes of saving face by squeezing a win. But they failed to take another wicket, the draw was conceded with Roger Telemachus's half-century - his unbroken seventh-wicket partnership with Smith worth 82 - and a match to forget was forgotten. </p> <p>\u0095 England began their Under-19 World Cup defence with an eight-wicket win over the Americas in Colombo. The Americas, composed of players from the US, Bermuda, Canada and Argentina, made 105 in 33.1 overs and England were never in trouble after an opening stand of 68 between Warwickshire's Ian Bell, first out for 41, and Surrey's Michael Carberry.

Revealing a 10-point plan, including literacy and numeracy tests, self-presentation lessons, and job coaches, she said a significant number of people were still held back by a poor education. Appalled by figures which showed that 40% of young people on the ground-breaking programme lacked basic skills, ministers have decided that every person taking part will be screened for learning problems. But they will also be told to dress more snappily. \"First impressions count and the standard dress for interviews is a suit for men and something equally smart for women,\" a spokesman at the employment department said. \"We will make funds available for people who have no smart clothes, although it might be possible to get them on loan.\" The overhaul, on the second anniversary of the scheme, follows complaints from employers that a lack of basic skills, and a negative attitude in job interviews, are holding job seekers back.

      "body": "<p> The Jazz Cafe is half full, with a yawning chasm of a dance floor. Even though soulman Geno Washington will have to work some wild alchemy to get this lot going, he jumps on stage unperturbed. A group of girls at the back start up a chant: \"Geno! Geno!\" He leans on the microphone and says in a deadpan Louisiana drawl: \"Ye-e-ah. Baby, I love you crazy people.\" </p> <p>Accompanied by young, punchy trio The Purple Aces, he launches into an anarchic, beat-driven amalgam of blues and hardcore R&amp;B. Immortalised in Dexy's Midnight Runners's 1980 hit Geno Washington has been performing his soul roadshow since the early 60s when he was a US airman based in East Anglia. His style is unique, his attitude irreverent. As he announces at regular intervals: \"It's my shit, and I'll shake it where I want it.\" Van Morrison, for instance, gets short shrift. Just before they begin a version of Gloria, Washington says with a grin, \"We're gonna play the shit sideways just to piss him off.\" He then turns the song into a funky work-out, complete with snatches of manic laughter and lines from Wild Thing. The spirit of James Brown is then resurrected in a robust, tightly played Papa's Got a Brand-new Bag. </p> <p>By now the whooping girls are on the floor, along with couples doing rock'n'roll swing and ex-Rude Boys executing Motown moves. With his earthy delivery and ribald asides, Washington keeps stoking the energy level. He banters with the band - \"What's in the damn pot, motherfucker?\" he barks at his bassist between songs. Guitarist \"Wolf Man\", drummer \"Pinocchio\" and bass player \"Catfish\" remain resolutely good-natured, their line-up augmented every so often by a harmonica and a horn player. Their forceful pace matches Washington's powerful vocal style. Tonight the focus is not on original material - Washington plays to his strengths, mixing 50s grooves with 60s soul, dropping lines from one song into another. Nothing is sacred. The high point of the show comes towards the end when he sings a raw, intensely soulful version of I Put a Spell on You. \"I fooled around and fell in love,\" he ad libs, and the crowd urges him on, ecstatic. This is one man who knows how to keep his mojo working. </p> <p> At Clare Hall, Haywards Heath (01444 455440), January 28; Stafford Gatehouse (01785 253595), January 29; then touring</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Jazz Cafe is half full, with a yawning chasm of a dance floor. Even though soulman Geno Washington will have to work some wild alchemy to get this lot going, he jumps on stage unperturbed. A group of girls at the back start up a chant: \"Geno! Geno!\" He leans on the microphone and says in a deadpan Louisiana drawl: \"Ye-e-ah. Baby, I love you crazy people.\" Accompanied by young, punchy trio The Purple Aces, he launches into an anarchic, beat-driven amalgam of blues and hardcore R&amp;B. Immortalised in Dexy's Midnight Runners's 1980 hit Geno Washington has been performing his soul roadshow since the early 60s when he was a US airman based in East Anglia. His style is unique, his attitude irreverent. As he announces at regular intervals: \"It's my shit, and I'll shake it where I want it.\" Van Morrison, for instance, gets short shrift. Just before they begin a version of Gloria, Washington says with a grin, \"We're gonna play the shit sideways just to piss him off.\" He then turns the song into a funky work-out, complete with snatches of manic laughter and lines from Wild Thing. The spirit of James Brown is then resurrected in a robust, tightly played Papa's Got a Brand-new Bag. By now the whooping girls are on the floor, along with couples doing rock'n'roll swing and ex-Rude Boys executing Motown moves. With his earthy delivery and ribald asides, Washington keeps stoking the energy level. He banters with the band - \"What's in the damn pot, motherfucker?\" he barks at his bassist between songs. Guitarist \"Wolf Man\", drummer \"Pinocchio\" and bass player \"Catfish\" remain resolutely good-natured, their line-up augmented every so often by a harmonica and a horn player. Their forceful pace matches Washington's powerful vocal style. Tonight the focus is not on original material - Washington plays to his strengths, mixing 50s grooves with 60s soul, dropping lines from one song into another. Nothing is sacred. The high point of the show comes towards the end when he sings a raw, intensely soulful version of I Put a Spell on You. \"I fooled around and fell in love,\" he ad libs, and the crowd urges him on, ecstatic. This is one man who knows how to keep his mojo working. At Clare Hall, Haywards Heath (01444 455440), January 28; Stafford Gatehouse (01785 253595), January 29; then touring",

      "byline": "Interviews by Cayte Williams",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Kate Alexander, 32</strong> Press officer </p> <p>I work for Care International UK, a charity involved in the Kosovo crisis, and last April three of our aid workers were taken prisoner in Belgrade. I provided media support for the negotiators, which was a 24-hour job; I literally slept with my mobile phone on my pillow. Rather than be a martyr I asked my manager for a back-up team, called in favours and accepted all offers of help. I didn't feel inadequate because I recognised the workload was too much for one. If you're stressed and overworked, let everyone know, so they can help. </p> <p><strong> Michael Stowe, 55</strong> Management consultant </p> <p>I used to get really stressed at work until three years ago, when a psychologist friend suggested meditation. I went to classes and now I meditate for at least an hour in the morning before I go to work. Zen Buddhism has completely changed my attitude - I don't hang on to issues or conflicts any more. I realised how effective this was when a former boss tried to discredit me. It was a personality clash rather than anything to do with my performance; in the past I would have got even with her, but now I simply didn't react. I prayed for her instead. She eventually grew to respect me because I couldn't be riled, and in the end she left me alone. </p> <p> <strong> Guy Fisher, 35</strong> Systems manager </p> <p>The only way I can deal with stress is to make sure I don't take my work problems home with me. I keep my suit in the office and if I have to work out of office hours I go to the local library. I go to work in jeans and a sweatshirt and change when I get to the office. I used to ride a bike so I had an excuse not to wear a suit to work, but my bosses soon clicked that I was wearing \"civvies\" when I came in by tube or car. I work for a very traditional company, and they used to look at me strangely, but now they've accepted that it's my way of dealing with stress. </p> <p> <strong> Ruth Ashton, 31</strong> PR executive </p> <p>I worked for an arts festival once and had to get publicity for 14 shows, all of which required different approaches. It was a nightmare. I was always sluggish after lunch and at my best first thing in the morning, so I decided to go with my own rhythms rather than fight them. I'd get into the office at 8am, work out my strategy for the day and be on the phone at 9am. I got so much more done by midday, so in the afternoon I worked at an easier pace. I was more efficient because I was working to my own peak times. </p> <p><strong> Ian Thomas, 45</strong> Company director </p> <p>I gave up smoking 10 weeks ago. Cigarettes had always been my crutch during stressful periods at work; I've recently had the environmental health officers in to inspect my business, and I've had to deal with it without the help of nicotine. In the past I found that a cigarette break would often help me to centre my thoughts, so now I'll step outside and take a few long deep breaths of fresh air instead. This has made me realise that it was that five-minute break from work rather than the cigarette itself that was helping me cope with stress. I also used smoking to help me to wind down when I got home. Now I've replaced it by taking a hot shower or having a soak in the bath, followed by half a bottle of red wine. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Kate Alexander, 32 Press officer I work for Care International UK, a charity involved in the Kosovo crisis, and last April three of our aid workers were taken prisoner in Belgrade. I provided media support for the negotiators, which was a 24-hour job; I literally slept with my mobile phone on my pillow. Rather than be a martyr I asked my manager for a back-up team, called in favours and accepted all offers of help. I didn't feel inadequate because I recognised the workload was too much for one. If you're stressed and overworked, let everyone know, so they can help. Michael Stowe, 55 Management consultant I used to get really stressed at work until three years ago, when a psychologist friend suggested meditation. I went to classes and now I meditate for at least an hour in the morning before I go to work. Zen Buddhism has completely changed my attitude - I don't hang on to issues or conflicts any more. I realised how effective this was when a former boss tried to discredit me. It was a personality clash rather than anything to do with my performance; in the past I would have got even with her, but now I simply didn't react. I prayed for her instead. She eventually grew to respect me because I couldn't be riled, and in the end she left me alone. Guy Fisher, 35 Systems manager The only way I can deal with stress is to make sure I don't take my work problems home with me. I keep my suit in the office and if I have to work out of office hours I go to the local library. I go to work in jeans and a sweatshirt and change when I get to the office. I used to ride a bike so I had an excuse not to wear a suit to work, but my bosses soon clicked that I was wearing \"civvies\" when I came in by tube or car. I work for a very traditional company, and they used to look at me strangely, but now they've accepted that it's my way of dealing with stress. Ruth Ashton, 31 PR executive I worked for an arts festival once and had to get publicity for 14 shows, all of which required different approaches. It was a nightmare. I was always sluggish after lunch and at my best first thing in the morning, so I decided to go with my own rhythms rather than fight them. I'd get into the office at 8am, work out my strategy for the day and be on the phone at 9am. I got so much more done by midday, so in the afternoon I worked at an easier pace. I was more efficient because I was working to my own peak times. Ian Thomas, 45 Company director I gave up smoking 10 weeks ago. Cigarettes had always been my crutch during stressful periods at work; I've recently had the environmental health officers in to inspect my business, and I've had to deal with it without the help of nicotine. In the past I found that a cigarette break would often help me to centre my thoughts, so now I'll step outside and take a few long deep breaths of fresh air instead. This has made me realise that it was that five-minute break from work rather than the cigarette itself that was helping me cope with stress. I also used smoking to help me to wind down when I got home. Now I've replaced it by taking a hot shower or having a soak in the bath, followed by half a bottle of red wine.",

The convergence of the two fastest growing methods of communication - mobiles and the net - have produced endless theoretical applications. </p> <p><strong> Cheque</strong><br> </p> <p>But by 3.00pm today an important step will be taken toward that much-hyped future as the deadline passes for companies to make an initial application for one of the five licences available in the next generation of mobile phones, otherwise known as UMTS. The new wave follows analogue (the first generation) and the existing digital technology. </p> <p>Advisers to some of the world's most powerful telecoms companies are expected to make the journey to the radiocommunciations agency in London's Marsh Wall with a cheque for \u00a350m a piece to reserve their places in the auction. The department of trade and industry is expected to make an announcement on participants after the close of the stock market. </p> <p>Third generation will see data transferred at rates 200 times that of existing GSM phones - up to 2 megabytes a second. As well as higher quality voice, high bandwidth multimedia internet access and audio clips, UMTS will make video phones a commercial reality. Games, e-commerce and sophisticated online banking should also be available. </p> <p>Given the extraordinary growth of mobile phone use which last week saw Britain reach four in 10 people carrying handsets, the potential for mobile e-commerce far outstrips the PC, which is why the likes of Microsoft have been working with British Telecom on software applications. </p> <p>The four existing networks, Vodafone, BT Cellnet, Orange and One2One have all made their intention clear to bid in the auction. Others who have put their hands up include Spanish telecoms group Telefonica, France T\u00e9l\u00e9com - through its interest in cable company NTL - and Virgin, which has been in talks with various institutional backers. OneTel, the Australian reseller has also been named as a possible bidder as have Energis and Telecom Italia Mobile. </p> <p>Other than the costly exercise of buying either BT or Vodafone, this will be arguably the last chance for an overseas buyer to make an inroad to the lucrative British market. There are no technical or financial pre-qualification requirements and the information memorandum issued by investment bank NM Rothschild also states that a bidder need not be a telecommunications company, opening the field to newcomers. </p> <p>The DTI hopes to raise around \u00a31.5bn from the auction - suggesting that each licence will go under the hammer for between \u00a3400m and \u00a3500m. One part of the spectrum will be reserved for a new entrant and they can also bid alongside the existing operators for the other four licences. That may be unadvisable, however, as the existing four are likely to pay whatever it takes to win.\"The potential downside for one of the four existing networks not winning a licence is too strong,\" says one insider. Analysts estimate the cost of upgrading an existing network to UMTS at about \u00a32bn apiece. To build a new network from scratch for the fifth operator will cost \u00a35bn though the new entrant will be able to roam on the existing four networks while building its own. </p> <p>The high price has been enough to deter some. United News &amp; Media, owner of the Express newspapers and online service LineOne hired former telecoms regulator Don Cruickshank to act as a consultant but yesterday ruled out any frontline investment. \"We think it's exciting technology and are keen to be involved as a content provider but will not be involved in a bidding consortium,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>Before the arrival of UMTS, stepping stone technologies - often referred to as 2.5 generation - will open the way for internet access. Wireless application protocol (WAP) phones enabling web access will become widely available in the summer while another technology called GPRS is likely to launch at the end of the year with speeds similar to existing modems. </p> <p><strong> Changing</strong><br> </p> <p> There is some debate about just how much advantage UMTS will have over GPRS. One of the biggest changes brought by GPRS is that there will be no need to log on and off to the internet every time it is used. Instead, handsets will simply sit on standby with users paying for bytes downloaded rather than time spent online. \"There will be a huge explosion of web content aimed at mobiles,\" says Greg Ellard, applications director of Lucent Technology which is developing platforms for 2.5 generation phones. </p> <p>Higher speeds and the ability to cope with TV quality video should ensure continued interest in UMTS, however. Internet access through UMTS will also be closer to the experience of PCs as the smaller screens of WAP phones means web content needs to be reconfigured. As the number of people going online via phones increases, so more websites will be available in WAP format. but in the meantime access will be limited. </p> <p>BT Cellnet already has a limited internet access product called Genie while Vodafone launched a basic service at the end of last year, offering services such as news, sports, and share prices.</p>",

Cheque But by 3.00pm today an important step will be taken toward that much-hyped future as the deadline passes for companies to make an initial application for one of the five licences available in the next generation of mobile phones, otherwise known as UMTS. The new wave follows analogue (the first generation) and the existing digital technology. Advisers to some of the world's most powerful telecoms companies are expected to make the journey to the radiocommunciations agency in London's Marsh Wall with a cheque for \u00a350m a piece to reserve their places in the auction. The department of trade and industry is expected to make an announcement on participants after the close of the stock market. Third generation will see data transferred at rates 200 times that of existing GSM phones - up to 2 megabytes a second. As well as higher quality voice, high bandwidth multimedia internet access and audio clips, UMTS will make video phones a commercial reality. Games, e-commerce and sophisticated online banking should also be available. Given the extraordinary growth of mobile phone use which last week saw Britain reach four in 10 people carrying handsets, the potential for mobile e-commerce far outstrips the PC, which is why the likes of Microsoft have been working with British Telecom on software applications. The four existing networks, Vodafone, BT Cellnet, Orange and One2One have all made their intention clear to bid in the auction. Others who have put their hands up include Spanish telecoms group Telefonica, France T\u00e9l\u00e9com - through its interest in cable company NTL - and Virgin, which has been in talks with various institutional backers. OneTel, the Australian reseller has also been named as a possible bidder as have Energis and Telecom Italia Mobile. Other than the costly exercise of buying either BT or Vodafone, this will be arguably the last chance for an overseas buyer to make an inroad to the lucrative British market. There are no technical or financial pre-qualification requirements and the information memorandum issued by investment bank NM Rothschild also states that a bidder need not be a telecommunications company, opening the field to newcomers. The DTI hopes to raise around \u00a31.5bn from the auction - suggesting that each licence will go under the hammer for between \u00a3400m and \u00a3500m. One part of the spectrum will be reserved for a new entrant and they can also bid alongside the existing operators for the other four licences. That may be unadvisable, however, as the existing four are likely to pay whatever it takes to win.\"The potential downside for one of the four existing networks not winning a licence is too strong,\" says one insider. Analysts estimate the cost of upgrading an existing network to UMTS at about \u00a32bn apiece. To build a new network from scratch for the fifth operator will cost \u00a35bn though the new entrant will be able to roam on the existing four networks while building its own. The high price has been enough to deter some. United News &amp; Media, owner of the Express newspapers and online service LineOne hired former telecoms regulator Don Cruickshank to act as a consultant but yesterday ruled out any frontline investment. \"We think it's exciting technology and are keen to be involved as a content provider but will not be involved in a bidding consortium,\" a spokesman said. Before the arrival of UMTS, stepping stone technologies - often referred to as 2.5 generation - will open the way for internet access. Wireless application protocol (WAP) phones enabling web access will become widely available in the summer while another technology called GPRS is likely to launch at the end of the year with speeds similar to existing modems. Changing There is some debate about just how much advantage UMTS will have over GPRS. One of the biggest changes brought by GPRS is that there will be no need to log on and off to the internet every time it is used. Instead, handsets will simply sit on standby with users paying for bytes downloaded rather than time spent online. \"There will be a huge explosion of web content aimed at mobiles,\" says Greg Ellard, applications director of Lucent Technology which is developing platforms for 2.5 generation phones. Higher speeds and the ability to cope with TV quality video should ensure continued interest in UMTS, however. Internet access through UMTS will also be closer to the experience of PCs as the smaller screens of WAP phones means web content needs to be reconfigured. As the number of people going online via phones increases, so more websites will be available in WAP format. but in the meantime access will be limited. BT Cellnet already has a limited internet access product called Genie while Vodafone launched a basic service at the end of last year, offering services such as news, sports, and share prices.",
