      "trailText": "<p>There's one club in the First Division promotion posse that doesn't want to get to the play-offs.  It is of course Ipswich who've been there unsuccessfully in the last three years.  Surely not again? They now lie second in the table and Jon Brodkin talks to Blues boss George Burley ahead of the derby with Norwich tomorrow.</p>",
      "byline": "Jon Brodkin",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Ipswich Town fans shudder at the thought of it. Not even the idea of employing Nicolas Anelka as director of team spirit could fill them with more dread. \"It is,\" says one supporter, \"a nightmare scenario.\" And that is putting a gloss on matters. </p> <p>The scenario, of course, is ending up in the play-offs. In the past three seasons Ipswich have collapsed there without as much as a stroll down Wembley Way. Now the doom merchants can sniff a repeat. Sure, George Burley's side are sitting pretty in second place but two points from a possible 12 do not augur well. If Manchester City win their game in hand, Ipswich - whisper it - will drop to third. </p> <p>Yet if Burley is feeling the strain he is hiding it impeccably. It seems cruel to talk to him about the play-offs, akin to to waving a bottle of wine under George Best's nose. But the Scot, perched on a sofa in his office, could hardly appear more relaxed. And that with the derby at home to Norwich tomorrow. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt there is pressure,\" the 43-year-old says. \"There is added pressure on us because people get the picture that we are dreading the play-offs. Teams like Wolves and Birmingham and Blackburn would be pleased as punch to get in the play-offs. We've got this thing over us that we've got to finish second. </p> <p>\"Of course we want to but we'll certainly not worry about it. The fans and the media feel you can't go through that again, but I've always believed you finish where you deserve after 46 games. </p> <p>\"Where you need luck is in the play-offs and I don't think we've had that against Sheffield United and Bolton. I felt we were the better team in both.\" Both ties, cruelly, were lost on away goals. </p> <p>Burley, not surprisingly, is hardly a huge fan of the play-offs in their current guise. Good for keeping things alive, he concedes, but probably in need of a tweak. \"People have said if you finish third you should go straight into the final instead of having to play two games,\" he says. \"That might be something which gives you an advantage.\" </p> <p>Certainly last year's episode was harsh on Ipswich, who had finished third, a point behind Bradford. Had Wolves scored rather than hit the post against Paul Jewell's team on the final day, Ipswich would have gone up. But it was carelessness as well as bad luck that cost them. </p> <p>Three of the last five games were lost, notably a home match against Crewe, and this month's results hint at another untimely failure to kill teams off. First an unbeaten run of 18 league games was ended at Portman Road by Portsmouth. Then Ipswich were held at home by Blackburn and defeated at Wolves, failing to capitalise on Manchester City's slip. Graduates from the Novotna school of choking? Burley says not. </p> <p>\"It's been disappointing as far as points are concerned but not in terms of performances,\" he explains. \"Some of our football has been outstanding; as well as we've played all season. </p> <p>\"We went to Birmingham and Wolves and completely outplayed them but unfortunately didn't get the wins our football deserved. That's where we've lacked. But we won't be changing our tactics or style.\" </p> <p>While Burley, a member of the great Ipswich teams of the 70s, is in charge there is more chance of cloned pigs flying. \"Football-wise we're the best in the divi sion,\" he says. \"I wouldn't swap us for anybody, even Charlton. Ipswich have got a style and the supporters want us to play in a certain manner. The chairman, the directors and I want that as well. I was brought up as a youngster by Bobby Robson at Ipswich and I won't change it. </p> <p>\"Maybe if we went route one and used long throws all the time we might win where other times we won't but I believe in the way we play and I believe we're good enough to get promotion with that.\" </p> <p>Burley is convinced this is the best squad he has had since he took over a side tumbling out of the Premiership in December 1994. After all the heartbreaks it is also the most determined. Kieron Dyer has been missed but his \u00a36.5m fee has enabled the astute manager to bring in several players, including the record signing Marcus Stewart for \u00a32.5m from Huddersfield Town. </p> <p>Among the staff and most fans there seems to be a genuine optimism. \"Football supporters tend to look on the black side of things,\" says Philip Ham, editor of the fanzine Those Were The Days. \"But everyone is looking to second and not even considering the play-offs.\" Few neutrals wish them ill. </p> <p>But much as Ipswich's stylish football is a help, it also looks their greatest hindrance. Jamie Scowcroft, the England Under-21 striker who has suffered through all three play-off defeats, explains: \"Teams literally change their system and their personnel just to stop us, and sometimes they do that quite effectively. We work in training on trying to get round it but it's a question of being patient. I think that's probably our biggest problem.\" As Burley says: \"That's what we've got to overcome to win promotion.\" </p> <p>The good news for Ipswich is that they are hardly alone in inconsistency among the leading lights. And apart from Charlton, whom they play in their penultimate match, they meet no one in the current top seven before the season ends. Not that tomorrow will be easy. Norwich's caretaker manager Bryan Hamilton is a former Ipswich player and Burley's one-time No2. The atmosphere should be better than it often has been at Portman Road. </p> <p>\"I think against some teams the fans just expect us to turn up and win,\" Scowcroft says. \"They're nervous of us finishing in the play-offs and if we do finish third some people might see that as a bit of a disaster and a failure. The expectation is high.\" </p> <p>The need to go up is also great with the club losing more than \u00a31m a year in the First Division. Their success is all the more impressive given the enforced sales of players such as Dyer and Mauricio Taricco. </p> <p>Whatever happens, Burley knows Richard Wright could be hard to hold on to. He expects Kevin Keegan to take the goalkeeper to Euro 2000 - \"I know Kevin's talked to Richard and other people and I'm almost sure he'll go\" - but for the time being all eyes are on second spot. </p> <p>\"We've only got one aim and that's to finish in the top two,\" Scowcroft says. \"We'll be bitterly disappointed if we don't. But if we get in the play-offs, so be it. Losing the last three has been a hard pill to swallow but winning at Wembley would certainly be a good way to go up.\" If it comes to it, fourth time lucky, perhaps. </p> <p><strong> 1996-97 </strong> Finished: fourth. Five wins in their last six games lifted mid-table Town to play-offs. Were leading 2-1 in the semi-final second leg with 13 minutes left when Andy Walker put Sheffield United through on away goals. <strong> Play-off</strong> Sheff Utd 1 Ipswich 1. Ipswich 2 Sheff Utd 2 aet. <strong> Promoted through play-offs</strong> Crystal Palace (sixth) </p> <p><strong> 1997-98 </strong> Finished: fifth. Having been as low as 15th in the middle of January, Town's amazing run of 16 wins in their last 20 games took them to within eight points of second-placed Middlesbrough.

      "bodyText": "Ipswich Town fans shudder at the thought of it. Not even the idea of employing Nicolas Anelka as director of team spirit could fill them with more dread. \"It is,\" says one supporter, \"a nightmare scenario.\" And that is putting a gloss on matters. The scenario, of course, is ending up in the play-offs. In the past three seasons Ipswich have collapsed there without as much as a stroll down Wembley Way. Now the doom merchants can sniff a repeat. Sure, George Burley's side are sitting pretty in second place but two points from a possible 12 do not augur well. If Manchester City win their game in hand, Ipswich - whisper it - will drop to third. Yet if Burley is feeling the strain he is hiding it impeccably. It seems cruel to talk to him about the play-offs, akin to to waving a bottle of wine under George Best's nose. But the Scot, perched on a sofa in his office, could hardly appear more relaxed. And that with the derby at home to Norwich tomorrow. \"There's no doubt there is pressure,\" the 43-year-old says. \"There is added pressure on us because people get the picture that we are dreading the play-offs. Teams like Wolves and Birmingham and Blackburn would be pleased as punch to get in the play-offs. We've got this thing over us that we've got to finish second. \"Of course we want to but we'll certainly not worry about it. The fans and the media feel you can't go through that again, but I've always believed you finish where you deserve after 46 games. \"Where you need luck is in the play-offs and I don't think we've had that against Sheffield United and Bolton. I felt we were the better team in both.\" Both ties, cruelly, were lost on away goals. Burley, not surprisingly, is hardly a huge fan of the play-offs in their current guise. Good for keeping things alive, he concedes, but probably in need of a tweak. \"People have said if you finish third you should go straight into the final instead of having to play two games,\" he says. \"That might be something which gives you an advantage.\" Certainly last year's episode was harsh on Ipswich, who had finished third, a point behind Bradford. Had Wolves scored rather than hit the post against Paul Jewell's team on the final day, Ipswich would have gone up. But it was carelessness as well as bad luck that cost them. Three of the last five games were lost, notably a home match against Crewe, and this month's results hint at another untimely failure to kill teams off. First an unbeaten run of 18 league games was ended at Portman Road by Portsmouth. Then Ipswich were held at home by Blackburn and defeated at Wolves, failing to capitalise on Manchester City's slip. Graduates from the Novotna school of choking? Burley says not. \"It's been disappointing as far as points are concerned but not in terms of performances,\" he explains. \"Some of our football has been outstanding; as well as we've played all season. \"We went to Birmingham and Wolves and completely outplayed them but unfortunately didn't get the wins our football deserved. That's where we've lacked. But we won't be changing our tactics or style.\" While Burley, a member of the great Ipswich teams of the 70s, is in charge there is more chance of cloned pigs flying. \"Football-wise we're the best in the divi sion,\" he says. \"I wouldn't swap us for anybody, even Charlton. Ipswich have got a style and the supporters want us to play in a certain manner. The chairman, the directors and I want that as well. I was brought up as a youngster by Bobby Robson at Ipswich and I won't change it. \"Maybe if we went route one and used long throws all the time we might win where other times we won't but I believe in the way we play and I believe we're good enough to get promotion with that.\" Burley is convinced this is the best squad he has had since he took over a side tumbling out of the Premiership in December 1994. After all the heartbreaks it is also the most determined. Kieron Dyer has been missed but his \u00a36.5m fee has enabled the astute manager to bring in several players, including the record signing Marcus Stewart for \u00a32.5m from Huddersfield Town. Among the staff and most fans there seems to be a genuine optimism. \"Football supporters tend to look on the black side of things,\" says Philip Ham, editor of the fanzine Those Were The Days. \"But everyone is looking to second and not even considering the play-offs.\" Few neutrals wish them ill. But much as Ipswich's stylish football is a help, it also looks their greatest hindrance. Jamie Scowcroft, the England Under-21 striker who has suffered through all three play-off defeats, explains: \"Teams literally change their system and their personnel just to stop us, and sometimes they do that quite effectively. We work in training on trying to get round it but it's a question of being patient. I think that's probably our biggest problem.\" As Burley says: \"That's what we've got to overcome to win promotion.\" The good news for Ipswich is that they are hardly alone in inconsistency among the leading lights. And apart from Charlton, whom they play in their penultimate match, they meet no one in the current top seven before the season ends. Not that tomorrow will be easy. Norwich's caretaker manager Bryan Hamilton is a former Ipswich player and Burley's one-time No2. The atmosphere should be better than it often has been at Portman Road. \"I think against some teams the fans just expect us to turn up and win,\" Scowcroft says. \"They're nervous of us finishing in the play-offs and if we do finish third some people might see that as a bit of a disaster and a failure. The expectation is high.\" The need to go up is also great with the club losing more than \u00a31m a year in the First Division. Their success is all the more impressive given the enforced sales of players such as Dyer and Mauricio Taricco. Whatever happens, Burley knows Richard Wright could be hard to hold on to. He expects Kevin Keegan to take the goalkeeper to Euro 2000 - \"I know Kevin's talked to Richard and other people and I'm almost sure he'll go\" - but for the time being all eyes are on second spot. \"We've only got one aim and that's to finish in the top two,\" Scowcroft says. \"We'll be bitterly disappointed if we don't. But if we get in the play-offs, so be it. Losing the last three has been a hard pill to swallow but winning at Wembley would certainly be a good way to go up.\" If it comes to it, fourth time lucky, perhaps. 1996-97 Finished: fourth. Five wins in their last six games lifted mid-table Town to play-offs. Were leading 2-1 in the semi-final second leg with 13 minutes left when Andy Walker put Sheffield United through on away goals. Play-off Sheff Utd 1 Ipswich 1. Ipswich 2 Sheff Utd 2 aet. Promoted through play-offs Crystal Palace (sixth) 1997-98 Finished: fifth. Having been as low as 15th in the middle of January, Town's amazing run of 16 wins in their last 20 games took them to within eight points of second-placed Middlesbrough. But they lost the winning habit after Jamie Clapham, right, conceded an own-goal early in the first leg of the play-off semi-final. Play-off Ipswich 0 Charlton 1. Charlton 1 Ipswich 0. Promoted through play-offs Charlton (fourth) 1998-99 Finished: third. In the top four by October, Town were three points clear in second place after a 3-1 win over QPR on April 5. Then three defeats in the last five games allowed Bradford to pip them to the second automatic spot by a single point. Despite a roller-coaster semi-final second leg, Ipswich were never in front on aggregate. Play-off Bolton 1 Ipswich 0. Ipswich 4 Bolton 3 aet. Promoted through play-offs Watford (fifth)",

They may have to emulate Watford a year ago; Wolves failed then with 73. </p> <p>Blackburn are the dark horses, bringing in Graeme Souness this week, a measure of their desperate hope still of getting straight back up. It is too long since Tony Parkes's caretaker magic wore off. They have probably left it three weeks too late. </p> <p>QPR, next above them, are living above their station on scant resources, a miracle of management and luck that cocks a splendid snook at Jack Walker's coffers. They are a bric-a-brac side in keeping with Gerry Francis. He keeps talking them down; they keep bobbing up. They will not bob into the top six. </p> <p>Nor will Bolton. Sam Allardyce is Bolton to his bootstraps, which is what he picked the club up by, like Parkes at Blackburn and more recently Neil Warnock at Sheffield United, after a bad start and a vacancy. But they have lost the quality they need to go on. </p> <p>Wolves have not really had it, which makes their position under Colin Lee impressive but not challenging.

      "body": "<p>Grandparents were aghast when we said we were taking our children (aged six, nine and 11) on holiday to Yemen. They recalled the deaths of the four tourists in December 1998 and pointed to the stark Foreign Office advice that this remote corner of Arabia is as dangerous as Somalia, Afghanistan or Chechnya. </p> <p>Remembering the four years we had spent in Yemen in the early 1980s, we were sure no harm awaited us. Nevertheless, in search of reassurance, I e-mailed an acquaintance in Sana'a but failed to get a reply. Eventually, the reason became apparent - she had been kidnapped. </p> <p>Fortunately, as with other \"traditional\" Yemeni kidnappings, all was speedily resolved. \"Hostages\" generally enjoy the hospitality offered them, call home on satellite phones and usually receive a parting gift. The tribesmen from the fringes of the Empty Quarter who carry out these publicity stunts get the clinic, school or whatever else they feel the central government has been remiss in supplying. </p> <p>The children's surprise at the large number of armed soldiers at Sana'a airport gave way to astonishment as we drove into the medieval old city. A lone passer-by, delayed on his way to bed after the all-night bustle of Ramadan, insisted on accompanying us to the door. </p> <p>We rang the bell and, far above us, our host pulled the cord that shot the bolt of his ancient wooden door. </p> <p>Downing rucksacks, the children raced up the narrow staircase of the eight-storey house, relishing the breathlessness induced by the rarefied air. Three pleasantly disorienting days followed as jet-lag, the 7,500ft altitude, the rhythm of Ramadan and the thrill of the unknown convinced the children that a week was passing. </p> <p>Losing ourselves in the labyrinth of the suq , we were stunned to find everything so affordable, \u00a31 buying 260 rials compared with only 10 in the 1980s. The boys were soon cheaply kitted out in colourful sarongs and curved daggers, our daughter in a skirt, leggings and headcloth. </p> <p>Passers-by were delighted to see tourists once more. Abandoning the warnings of \"stranger danger\" preached by British schools, the children soon got used to being patted. My partner marvelled at her ability to move at ease through the streets of a capital city at 2am. Our welfare seemed to concern the whole world. We could not stop to buy without strangers intervening to make doubly sure we were not being overcharged. </p> <p>The rigours of fasting seemed not to dent the geniality of the swarming crowds. After the sunset meal, their exuberance was infectious, their curiosity even more pressing. Invitations to come and chew qat , the favoured recreational drug of most highland Yemenis, were rebuffed with difficulty. Our younger son was grabbed by a man keen to teach him to dance. Within seconds, the road was blocked by a circle of swirling dancers, daggers flashing. </p> <p>In the suq, we were accosted by a stern man, whose bearing, expensive dagger and clean clothes showed him to be a tribesman of some rank. \"Would we like to be kidnapped?\" he asked. He could get his tribe to do the deed and would split the profits with us. It began the first of many discussions about the solitary fatal terrorist incident which has destroyed the tourist industry. </p> <p>Some 84,000 tourists visited Yemen in 1997; fewer than a tenth of that number came in 1999. A developed tourist infrastructure (a hundred local tourist agencies, comfortable hotels in major towns, a much-improved road and air network) stands idle. We did not meet a single tourist for the first two of our three weeks in Yemen. </p> <p>Dogs dozed in the shuttered doorway of the main tourist-information office in Sana'a. Disturbed from his own Ramadan slumbers, the man in charge rallied a smile and a prayer for better times as he opened up. </p> <p>We flew from Sana'a to Hadramawt, not risking the overland route through the ancient city of Marib and across the dunes of the Empty Quarter. Here the writ of the tribes carries more weight than that of the government, and travellers to these remote parts are advised to pay \u00a3200 for a group of Bedouins to drive ahead and alert would-be brigands that the travellers are locally vouched for. </p> <p>We descended from the plateau into the claustrophobic world of the 200km canyon of Wadi Hadramawt. In Sayyun's best hotel, air-conditioned doubles with satellite TV cost only \u00a310-\u00a315 a night. In Tarim, we stayed in an ornate former palace, built entirely of mud (except for the swimming pool). In Shibam, \"the Manhattan of Arabia\", one of three Unesco World Heritage Sites in Yemen, we wandered among the tower-houses, dodging goats and chatting to souvenir-shop owners desperate for a return to better times. </p> <p>Leaving the sealed roads, we entered the side wadi of Daw'an, fabled for its honey, the acumen of its businessmen and the grandiose mansions with which they proclaim their success. </p> <p>Then in one memorable day, we drove, perched on the roof-rack of our Landcruiser, from the Hadramawt to the Indian Ocean, crossing 300km of cold, stony steppe. The day ended in a fine hotel overlooking the sweeping bay of Mukalla and conversations with men eager to practise English and reminisce about the \"paradise\" of pre-Marxist British rule. </p> <p> T he long drive from Mukalla to Aden had its distractions: a school of dolphins leisurely cruising along the shore; climbing to the rim of an extinct volcano; chasing massive crabs along a deserted beach. Most exciting was the VIP treatment from the Yemeni army. In this area, where tourists were killed in 1998, the government takes no chances. For hundreds of kilometres, we were escorted by a succession of groups of armed men. The total premium paid to many soldiers for this additional travel insurance, negotiated in instalments at each check-point, was \u00a315. </p> <p>In the time-warp of Aden, we stayed in Crater, our hotel next to the Hurricane Cinema, from which we ventured to eat ridiculously cheap fish. Struggling to get back on its feet in the aftermath of the 1994 \"war of secession\", Aden is surely set to rival Goa and Mombasa as a winter-holiday destination. Its imposing physical presence, its perfect coves and beaches, the excitement of the balmy nights made it hard to leave. </p> <p>Christmas Day saw us chatting with the operator of a camel-driven sesame oil mill before putting the Landcruiser to its sternest test as we scaled the terraced slopes of Jabal Hufash. Sitting under a bush for a festive lunch, my daughter spotted a partridge perched in a prickly pear tree. </p> <p>The children were made much of in the mountain-top community of Manakha, poised on top of the pass linking Sana'a to the sea. The Hajjara Tourist Hotel provided riveting entertainment, waiters and cooks nightly metamorphosing into mesmeric dancers, singers and drummers. We tottered on donkeys over the mountains to a pilgrimage centre for a schismatic group of Ismailis. </p> <p>A final surprise lay in store. I looked round and my daughter had disappeared. Minutes passed before she re-emerged from a house wearing a veiled headdress. She could not be parted from it. </p> <p>I was photographing her when a bearded man berated me for my lack of respect for Islam. Did I not know that Yemeni women should not be photographed? On realising she was my daughter, he slunk away, stricken with embarrassment, to the amusement of bystanders. </p> <p>As the millennium dawned, the children braced themselves against the 3,000m chill of Yemen's highest town. New Year, as with Christmas, went blissfully unremarked by a people confident in the strength of their ancient culture and determined to overcome obstacles and build a self-reliant, and increasingly democratic, state.</p> <p>\u0095 Tim Morris is an anthropologist, development consultant and author of a book on development issues in Yemen (The Despairing Developer: Diary of an Aid Worker in the Middle East, IB Tauris, 1991, price \u00a316.95, but Amazon sells it for \u00a310.63). </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Tim Morris travelled to Sana'a with Royal Jordanian (through Bridge the World, 020 7911 0900) for \u00a3380, children half price.

A lone passer-by, delayed on his way to bed after the all-night bustle of Ramadan, insisted on accompanying us to the door. We rang the bell and, far above us, our host pulled the cord that shot the bolt of his ancient wooden door. Downing rucksacks, the children raced up the narrow staircase of the eight-storey house, relishing the breathlessness induced by the rarefied air. Three pleasantly disorienting days followed as jet-lag, the 7,500ft altitude, the rhythm of Ramadan and the thrill of the unknown convinced the children that a week was passing. Losing ourselves in the labyrinth of the suq , we were stunned to find everything so affordable, \u00a31 buying 260 rials compared with only 10 in the 1980s. The boys were soon cheaply kitted out in colourful sarongs and curved daggers, our daughter in a skirt, leggings and headcloth. Passers-by were delighted to see tourists once more. Abandoning the warnings of \"stranger danger\" preached by British schools, the children soon got used to being patted. My partner marvelled at her ability to move at ease through the streets of a capital city at 2am. Our welfare seemed to concern the whole world. We could not stop to buy without strangers intervening to make doubly sure we were not being overcharged. The rigours of fasting seemed not to dent the geniality of the swarming crowds. After the sunset meal, their exuberance was infectious, their curiosity even more pressing. Invitations to come and chew qat , the favoured recreational drug of most highland Yemenis, were rebuffed with difficulty. Our younger son was grabbed by a man keen to teach him to dance. Within seconds, the road was blocked by a circle of swirling dancers, daggers flashing. In the suq, we were accosted by a stern man, whose bearing, expensive dagger and clean clothes showed him to be a tribesman of some rank. \"Would we like to be kidnapped?\" he asked. He could get his tribe to do the deed and would split the profits with us. It began the first of many discussions about the solitary fatal terrorist incident which has destroyed the tourist industry. Some 84,000 tourists visited Yemen in 1997; fewer than a tenth of that number came in 1999. A developed tourist infrastructure (a hundred local tourist agencies, comfortable hotels in major towns, a much-improved road and air network) stands idle. We did not meet a single tourist for the first two of our three weeks in Yemen. Dogs dozed in the shuttered doorway of the main tourist-information office in Sana'a. Disturbed from his own Ramadan slumbers, the man in charge rallied a smile and a prayer for better times as he opened up. We flew from Sana'a to Hadramawt, not risking the overland route through the ancient city of Marib and across the dunes of the Empty Quarter. Here the writ of the tribes carries more weight than that of the government, and travellers to these remote parts are advised to pay \u00a3200 for a group of Bedouins to drive ahead and alert would-be brigands that the travellers are locally vouched for. We descended from the plateau into the claustrophobic world of the 200km canyon of Wadi Hadramawt. In Sayyun's best hotel, air-conditioned doubles with satellite TV cost only \u00a310-\u00a315 a night. In Tarim, we stayed in an ornate former palace, built entirely of mud (except for the swimming pool). In Shibam, \"the Manhattan of Arabia\", one of three Unesco World Heritage Sites in Yemen, we wandered among the tower-houses, dodging goats and chatting to souvenir-shop owners desperate for a return to better times. Leaving the sealed roads, we entered the side wadi of Daw'an, fabled for its honey, the acumen of its businessmen and the grandiose mansions with which they proclaim their success. Then in one memorable day, we drove, perched on the roof-rack of our Landcruiser, from the Hadramawt to the Indian Ocean, crossing 300km of cold, stony steppe. The day ended in a fine hotel overlooking the sweeping bay of Mukalla and conversations with men eager to practise English and reminisce about the \"paradise\" of pre-Marxist British rule. T he long drive from Mukalla to Aden had its distractions: a school of dolphins leisurely cruising along the shore; climbing to the rim of an extinct volcano; chasing massive crabs along a deserted beach. Most exciting was the VIP treatment from the Yemeni army. In this area, where tourists were killed in 1998, the government takes no chances. For hundreds of kilometres, we were escorted by a succession of groups of armed men. The total premium paid to many soldiers for this additional travel insurance, negotiated in instalments at each check-point, was \u00a315. In the time-warp of Aden, we stayed in Crater, our hotel next to the Hurricane Cinema, from which we ventured to eat ridiculously cheap fish. Struggling to get back on its feet in the aftermath of the 1994 \"war of secession\", Aden is surely set to rival Goa and Mombasa as a winter-holiday destination. Its imposing physical presence, its perfect coves and beaches, the excitement of the balmy nights made it hard to leave. Christmas Day saw us chatting with the operator of a camel-driven sesame oil mill before putting the Landcruiser to its sternest test as we scaled the terraced slopes of Jabal Hufash. Sitting under a bush for a festive lunch, my daughter spotted a partridge perched in a prickly pear tree. The children were made much of in the mountain-top community of Manakha, poised on top of the pass linking Sana'a to the sea. The Hajjara Tourist Hotel provided riveting entertainment, waiters and cooks nightly metamorphosing into mesmeric dancers, singers and drummers. We tottered on donkeys over the mountains to a pilgrimage centre for a schismatic group of Ismailis. A final surprise lay in store. I looked round and my daughter had disappeared. Minutes passed before she re-emerged from a house wearing a veiled headdress. She could not be parted from it. I was photographing her when a bearded man berated me for my lack of respect for Islam. Did I not know that Yemeni women should not be photographed? On realising she was my daughter, he slunk away, stricken with embarrassment, to the amusement of bystanders. As the millennium dawned, the children braced themselves against the 3,000m chill of Yemen's highest town. New Year, as with Christmas, went blissfully unremarked by a people confident in the strength of their ancient culture and determined to overcome obstacles and build a self-reliant, and increasingly democratic, state. \u0095 Tim Morris is an anthropologist, development consultant and author of a book on development issues in Yemen (The Despairing Developer: Diary of an Aid Worker in the Middle East, IB Tauris, 1991, price \u00a316.95, but Amazon sells it for \u00a310.63). The practicals Tim Morris travelled to Sana'a with Royal Jordanian (through Bridge the World, 020 7911 0900) for \u00a3380, children half price.

They were going home for good. </p> <p>Their plane crashed in Wester Ross, in a place they call the Fairy Lochs.

He loved the animals round them and thought about their future long before the green movement popped up. </p> <p>When Roland married Jane and moved to Montana to work at the Columbia Falls timber plant, he still hankered after the outdoor life his brother had shown him. After some years, he left his well-paid job and became an outfitter. Nothing to do with gentlemen's tailoring but taking parties into the wilderness during the hunting season. The elk head in Roland's study is proof of his expertise, although he says it's years since he killed one. </p> <p>They had 15 years of it, till the punishingly hard work and financial instability took its toll. By that time, Roland had begun to make a living from writing columns and doing radio broadcasts about the outdoor life. Now he and Jane travel about for several months of the year, doing signings and selling his books all over the West. They have a camper van with pink plush seats that fold down into a bed. \"You never sell as many books as you'd like, but it's enough to be independent,\" says Roland. </p> <p>We go for a walk one afternoon to a local trail near Teakettle Mountain, which you can see from the Cheeks' house. The trail leads us uphill, past clumps of creamy little pearls called snowberries and through fine woods of mountain maple, tamarack and silver birch. The tamarack is a deciduous conifer, and Roland says that when the needles drop it's like walking through a shower of golden rain. </p> <p>The following morning, we go into Kalispell. Like many American small towns, Kalispell is spread out over what seems to a European to be an unnecessarily large area. \"We're profligate with our space,\" observes Roland, a keen conservationist. </p> <p>Later, we drive up to Glacier Park, stopping on the way at the Hungry Horse Dam, which sends power down through 17 smaller dams into Nevada. It was the fourth largest dam in the world when it was built. \"It destroyed the scenery round here,\" says Roland. \"There used to be meadows and valleys. It was really pretty.\" He shakes his head. \"Just so that Las Vegas can have neon lights.\" </p> <p>At Glacier Park, we walk through the forest to the McDonald River, a forest that has been here more than 1,000 years. There are spruces, which have a little sting when you touch the needles, and Douglas firs, which are soft. When they grow to maturity, there's only a small clump of foliage at the top, which makes them look like strange forest palms. Deeper into the forest are scores of hemlock trees, with tracery dripping from them like the cobwebs on Miss Havisham's wedding cake. </p> <p>Roland points out deer tracks on the trail and lacerations on many of the tree trunks, the bark hanging off in strips. Cougars have been using the trees as scratching posts to display their sexual prowess to the females. They cover a vast amount of land, 10 miles in one direction and 10 or 15 in the other. Then, after they have finally come together with a female, they go off alone again. </p> <p>We stand in the heart of the forest, listening, but there is no padded footfall behind. Everything is still, till you look up and see the tops of the trees swaying in a breeze that does not penetrate the lower reaches of the forest. There is no silence here either, with the drilling of woodpeckers and the rush of the river a few hundred yards on. </p> <p>It's so cold that part of the highway has been closed off, white with frozen snow. We head back to the car and round to McDonald Lake. There, drinking coffee, Roland says there's something religious about writing, the responsibility you have to tell the truth.

It is not unusual in the morning to see a sea eagle catching fish and see whales, turtles, sea snakes or porpoises as well. \u0095 Bagman to Swagman: Tales of Broome, the North-West and Other Australian Adventures, by Alistair McAlpine, is published by Allen &amp; Unwin at \u00a314.99",

Five beautiful mountains crinkle out into a range of hanging valleys and semi-secret sweeps of piste through the pines: nearly 70 runs served by four cablecars plus 50 chairlifts and drags. </p> <p>The two-dozen streets among the chalets may be a foolhardy place to take a car, with the traditional Petit Train adding to a confusion of hoots, but for pottering about, the absorbent effect of the shops and caf\u00e9s is remarkable. </p> <p>The same applies to the slopes. You will not escape queues - this isn't Brigadoon in the snow - but the crushes come and go like amoebas and never affect every lift at any of the focal points at the same time. Inevitably, the main pressure comes in the morning on the two gondolas and the chairlift from the valley bottom; but you can squeeze in a couple of runs on the three nearby drags until the \u00c9cole du Ski Fran\u00e7ais mini-hordes are up at Chavannes. Les Gets is not for you if you dislike children. They were swarming - and showing their usual amazing ability to sidle through queues, even on skis. </p> <p>There is the usual mezzanine stop halfway up the hill - four good restaurants, again with the queue-absorbing trick - and the gateway to a network of ups, downs and sidewayses (six miles of well-planned cross-country ski de fond ), which take almost exactly a week to work out. </p> <p>Les Gets is primarily red-route country, with a few challenging blacks, but it also has an intricate web of blues and even - my own little world - an intriguing way of visiting all but one of the summits on greens. Or sort-of greens. You need a little ingenuity here and there, and a vin chaud to pluck up the courage to slither briefly across a red; but then the mountain restaurants of La Rosta, Ranfoilly, Pleney and Nyon are yours. </p> <p>From there, you have a breathtaking panorama of the Mont Blanc massif, deceptively near to the eye, with the whole grand jaw of Mont Maudit, the Aiguille du Midi, the Dru and the Grandes Jorasses spiking the sky. La Rosta is particularly lovely as a belvedere; heading its own quiet mountain bowl with a choice of green, blue, red and black to take you back to a gentle traverse through the woods and on to the village. </p> <p>The Scalextric world of ski de fond , with its preciously-guarded tramlines, has another eight miles on Mont Ch\u00e9ry, a single peak on the shady side of the valley facing the four other tops. From halfway up, you can also enjoy what are called \"walks\", but these are better taken on the bottom, sliding down through the pines like a human sledge. </p> <p>Exploring the whole domaine skiable would absorb all your time, especially if you ski down to the bigger, neighbouring resort of Morzine and on into the four other massifs of the Portes du Soleil. But few will have time for more than a taste, particularly if they want to sample Les Gets' non-skiing attractions, such as hang-gliding, husky-driving and - our option - a snowshoe walk to spot chamois and mouflon in a forgotten valley of huge icicles and drifts. </p> <p>Our \"garde nature\" spoke mainly into his beard but thoughtfully brought both a telescope - so the whole family can now describe a mouflon's bottom - and some invigorating Alpine gin. </p> <p><strong>The praticals</strong></p> <p>Les Gets tourist office, Maison des Gets, BP27, 74260 Les Gets, France. 0033 450 758 080.

      "body": "<p>First come the strawberries; splashes of red on fruit stalls where before all was green and yellow. Then it's the Sicilian cherries, not due till April but here already. Finally it's the tourists, pinker and softer but just as welcome, because it means spring has made it to Rome. </p> <p>Venerable signoras still strut in their furs, but they fool no one. Winter is vanquished. Warmth and light seep across the piazzas. Sunglasses resting on foreheads since October drop back to their rightful place. Azaleas bloom on the Spanish Steps. Waiters in white jackets swarm from caf\u00e9s to serve the season's first outdoor customers. </p> <p>A Roman spring is a wonderful thing, but this year is special. It is the Vatican's most ambitious holy year, or jubilee. Pope John Paul II has summoned tens of millions of Catholic pilgrims to celebrate the 2,000th birthday of Jesus Christ. Spurn the invitation and you will regret it, even in this life. The city has pulled out all the stops for the most extensive beautification in a century. A billion and a half pounds, political resolve and years of scrubbing, building and planning have transformed hundreds of churches, galleries, palaces, museums and monuments. </p> <p>Jubilee planning glitches fuelled fears that Rome's creaky infrastructure would snap. Airports, trains, subways and hotels would be overwhelmed by the invasion, gridlock and chaos would produce anarchy, the media warned. Well, not yet they haven't. The infrastructure is working. Not quite like clockwork, but working nevertheless. </p> <p>But for a spring visitor the scare stories have had the added bonus of deterring tourists, pilgrims and tour operators - they are afraid to come. So there is no invasion. A steady stream, yes, but no stampede. Museum attendance figures have plunged, and Renaissance masterpieces usually seen only after 20-minute queues reside in splendid isolation. All this may change as word spreads that a weekend in Rome is not Armageddon. Easter will attract more pilgrims. But it is a fair bet that the relative serenity will last longer than the cherries. </p> <p>To make the most of a weekend, it helps to bring several things. An indifference to imminent death is the first. The imminence is almost always illusory. The two taxis, five cars and seven scooters breaking a red light as you cross the road may indeed be racing in your specific direction, their drivers and riders may blare horns, shout and make odd gestures, but they will not hit you. Pedestrians cross streets wherever and whenever they want. The traffic's highly-strung-but-finely-tuned reflex will guarantee safe passage, more or less. It is a simple system that broke down only once, when scores were squashed by liberating but uninformed GI truck drivers. </p> <p>Also helpful is comfy footwear, as almost all the major attractions are within walking distance of each other. Doing as the Romans do and clicking over cobblestones in heels might strike a bella figura , but to avoid blisters wear runners and try to ignore the swivelled eyes of admonition. </p> <p>Even more valuable is a large, empty stomach. Don't worry if it's small to begin with. A breakfast of corniche and cappuccino, a trattoria lunch of antipasto, pasta, steak, salad and pie, an early-evening pit stop for ice cream followed by another five-course meal will soon stretch it. Spring, when cows are fed fresh forage, is an especially good time for cheese. Count the calories and feel guilty if you must, but obesity is not a problem for Romans. </p> <p>Years would not be enough to savour all of Rome's trea sures but just a few hours are enough to appreciate one jubilee glory: traffic has been banished from dozens of streets and almost 100 squares. The 1200BC Egyptian obelisk at the centre of the majestic Piazza del Popolo is circled only by pedestrians. For the first time in generations Campo dei Fiori, a vegetable market where the philosopher Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake in 1600, is a place to chat and eat, free from exhaust fumes. </p> <p>London has its dome, Rome has its facelift. Scaffolding has tumbled to reveal gleaming restorations. The Michelangelo-designed Piazza del Campidoglio literally shines. The Capitoline museums - home to works by Caravaggio, Titian and Rubens - are larger and better. </p> <p>The former papal stables at the 18th-century Quirinale have been scrubbed and opened to the public for the first time ever. It currently hosts an exhibition of French impressionist paintings from the Hermitage in St Petersburg. </p> <p>The Villa Borghese gallery was reopened three years ago after a 13-year restoration. The park's secret gardens, where the Borghese hoarded their fruit and vegetables, was re-opened in December. Smack in the centre is the gorgeous but often overlooked Doria Pamphili gallery, owned and run by an aristocratic Anglo-Italian dynasty. Open six days a week, it boasts Breughels, Berninis, Titians, Tintorettos and major works by Caravaggio. Best of all is the world-famous Velazquez depiction of Pope Innocent X. </p> <p>Squatting just across Piazza Venezia is that bombastic turn-of-the-century glorification to Italian unity, the Victor Emmanuel II monument. A huge, white wedding cake it may be, but it too has been returned to its original brightness and a visitor centre has been added. </p> <p>The list goes on. Buildings restored, museum opening hours extended, new attractions, such as the ruins of Nero's palace, opened. And, of course, there are the old reliables: the Forum, the Colosseum, Byzantine mosaics, catacombs. </p> <p>It would be easy, but a shame, to miss John Paul. It was he who persuaded the civic authorities to pay for the facelift. The jubilee is his glory and his twilight. At noon every Sunday, he speaks from a balcony overlooking St Peter's Square. Hold up a placard with your home town and you may get a mention. And St Peter's basilica is, of course, restored to its splendour. The church has held jubilees roughly every 25 years since 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII summoned pilgrims to Rome instead of the holy land, which had become too perilous. </p> <p>The only threat the modern pilgrims have to contend with are the pickpockets. The number 64 bus from Termini station to the Vatican is notorious as the pickpocket express, but don't let this put you off - surveys show Rome to be safer from theft and violence than most European capitals. Just one tip: if beggars offer a piece of paper to read, don't hold it, keep your hands in your pockets. </p> <p>Rome is a city that lends itself to raving. About the food, the drink, the sunshine, the history, the treasures. Whatever your appetite, it leaves you stuffed and wanting more. \"I now realise all the dreams of my youth,\" wrote Goethe on arriving in 1786.

      "body": "<p>At about 10:30pm every night of the year there's a shift change at the Yumbo Centre in Playa del Ingles, Gran Canaria. It's not the staff who are changing over, but the clientele. Before 10:30pm, families browse cheap leather goods and sportswear. German couples with lemon sweaters over their shoulders relax with an after-dinner drink. </p> <p>After 10:30pm - curfew time for families and yellow sweaters - the centre fills with a very different, more hedonistic crowd: higher spending, better haircuts. It may be the archetypal package-tour resort, but Playa del Ingles/Maspalomas is also the biggest gay resort in Europe. And the Yumbo Centre is its epicentre. </p> <p>Drag artiste Sandra Lumumba's map lists 47 gay venues there, mostly bars. It's more than either Soho or Canal Street in Manchester can offer, and it's also very much a male scene. </p> <p>For a while, the two worlds meet and mingle. A few straight tourists stay longer to take in a drag show, safely risqu\u00e9 and - performers aside - not particularly gay. But the two worlds are, for all their peaceful co-existence, astonishingly separate. </p> <p>For gay-tour operators, Gran Canaria represents up to 90% of their winter business. Despite new trends in gay travel, Gran Canaria and the other gay favourites - Ibiza, Sitges, Mykonos and, to a lesser extent, Torremolinos, Palma and Benidorm - show no sign of losing popularity. For these places, gay tourism is an important part of the local economy, which translates into a welcome for gay visitors rather than just grudging acceptance. </p> <p>Rob Harkavy, director of gay tour operator Respect Holidays, says, \"Hoteliers love the fact that we're a gay company because they tend not to get their hotel rooms or apartments smashed up, and they tend not to get complaints from other residents about terrible drunken revelry at four o'clock in the morning. </p> <p>\"British tourists have had a dreadful reputation over the years but this kind of British tourist doesn't.\" </p> <p>The established resorts offer facilities on a massive scale for gay visitors. Sheer size creates a safe and welcoming atmosphere, and there is little if any reported homophobia or violence against gays. It would be hard for new destinations to muscle in - the promise of two gay bars isn't enough: 22 and you might be in business. It's one reason the list of gay favourites changes so little. </p> <p>So who goes there? Harkavy says, \"My imaginary customer is a 45-year-old teacher in Droitwich - he can't go out in Soho every night of the week. Of all our destinations, Gran Canaria and its summer equivalent, Ibiza, attract the highest number of visitors flying from airports other than Gatwick or Manchester.\" </p> <p>For British gay men who don't live within commuting distance of a major city, it's cheaper and easier to fly to Gran Canaria than to spend a week clubbing in London or Manchester. There's also a beach, of course - and the weather is rather better. </p> <p>There is tremendous loyalty to both destination and tour operator. \"Our repeat business is something like eight times the travel industry average - it's extraordinary - but in return for that, expectations are high,\" says Harkavy. </p> <p>Going Places recently set up Travel Unlimited, a gay division of its telephone- sales operation Holidayline. It's the first mainstream company targeting the gay market. But there are few signs of others following their lead. First Choice says: \"Most travel operators are looking at the gay market with a view to how they can market to it in the future, but there's nothing at the moment.\" </p> <p>The gay visitor's typical day in Gran Canaria doesn't start early. Most exclusively-gay accommodation isn't in the concrete jungle of Playa del Ingles but in its bungalow suburb of Maspalomas, which is leafier, quieter and easier on the eye. But Maspalomas boasts one of the most spectacular beaches in the Canary Islands and gay visitors take full advantage. </p> <p>Gay beaches tend to be quieter, more remote and less spoilt by mass tourism. Maspalomas offers seclusion in abundance. There's a gay section of the rather windy beachfront, but there's also a substantial gay section in the vast dunes behind it. The dunes are the daytime counterpoint to the Yumbo Centre, big enough for everyone to have a dune each if they choose. </p> <p>Trees act as windbreaks and help create suntraps as well as offering privacy. It's no coincidence that the gay section is adjacent to the naturist area: both groups crave privacy and many gay men like to sunbathe naked. </p> <p>After a day on the beach, many gay men make their way to the public terrace in front of the Riu Palace Hotel in Playa del Ingles. It's a chance to see what the people from the next sand dune look like up close and to watch the sun set behind the Maspalomas lighthouse. Some go on to the Cita Centre for coffee and cakes at Caf\u00e9 Wien. It's one of the few culinary highlights of southern Gran Canaria and suggests Austrians are rather better at patisserie than they are at politics. </p> <p>After sunset, many take a disco nap to prepare for the night ahead. Dinner tends to be late, and it's often nothing special: few restaurants in Playa del Ingles rise above the steak and seafood mediocrity of the tourist menu. </p> <p>Soon it's 10:30pm again and time to go back to the Yumbo. It offers gay bars of every type - convivial places, cruisy ones and even bars for gay pensioners, who can have a waltz and a schnapps at Na Und. </p> <p>While straight visitors lap up the drag cabaret at Caf\u00e9 Labelle, gay men prefer the leather and feathers at Centre Stage, where every night is Julie Andrews night. </p> <p>But the nightlife doesn't really get going until around midnight, when the slicker, more international bars on the top floor start to fill up. Each pumps out the Euro hits on video: Ricky Martin, Aqua, maybe something with a harder edge. Tubos is the first to fill, then the crowd moves around to Mykonos before reaching the Metropole Disco. The process takes three hours. The crowd is younger than in the downstairs bars, with more evidence of time at the gym. </p> <p>Despite the absence - except at weekends - of Canarian men, this procession from one bar to another is the most Spanish feature of Gran Canaria's gay nightlife. Drinkers who linger too long in one bar will find it empties as the in-crowd moves on. At 4am, the upper level winds down and the large disco bars on the opposite side of the centre - XL and Kings - crank up the energy. Kings dances on until 6am; you haven't really done gay Gran Canaria until you've been there at the bitter end. No wonder the gay presence seems to melt away during the day. Gay men rarely have the best suntans on the plane home.</p> <p><strong>Pink spots</strong></p> <p><strong>Five to be seen in</strong></p> <p> <strong> Gran Canaria</strong>, <strong> Sitges</strong>, <strong> Ibiza</strong> and <strong> Mykonos</strong> have been established gay favourites since the 1970s. There was a hippy trail element to the original popularity of both Mykonos and Ibiza. Sitges is to Barcelona what Brighton is to London. With Spanish resorts, in particular, the price of packages is no higher now than in the 1980s. <strong> Sydney</strong> has grown as a gay destination for UK-based tourists since the arrival of charter flights and thanks to the strength of the pound. Its success came on strongly in the 1990s, and, of course, the profile of Mardi Gras - the world's biggest gay and lesbian carnival every February - just gets higher and higher. </p> <p><strong> Five to watch</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>Barcelona</strong> benefits from the same value factor as any Spanish destination. It's very close to Sitges (reachable via the local train network), so can easily combine as a two-centre break, and is a very gay-friendly city with good nightlife. </p> <p><strong>Cape Town</strong> is the newest arrival - excellent nightlife and very cheap. There are gay-friendly safaris among other things, so it appeals to more than a bar-hopping crowd. </p> <p><strong>Paris</strong> has always been a popular destination, but Eurostar has boosted its appeal since it came on stream. </p> <p><strong>New York</strong>, again popular for a long time, has been given a recent boost by the strength of the pound and cheap flights. </p> <p><strong>Bangkok</strong> dipped in popularity in the 1990s but is bouncing back. A lot of the seedier side has been eliminated. It is a stopover for Sydney, of course, and so benefits from the increased traffic to that hotspot. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Two weeks at Club Albatros, Maspalomas from June 5 costs \u00a3355 with Respect Holidays (020 7485 8855). One week at Los Juncos Il Apartmenst, Playa del Ingles in June costs \u00a3235 with Sensations Holidays (020 8900 0809). All holidays are self-catering, from Gatwick and prices are based on two sharing.</p>",

It would be hard for new destinations to muscle in - the promise of two gay bars isn't enough: 22 and you might be in business. It's one reason the list of gay favourites changes so little. So who goes there? Harkavy says, \"My imaginary customer is a 45-year-old teacher in Droitwich - he can't go out in Soho every night of the week. Of all our destinations, Gran Canaria and its summer equivalent, Ibiza, attract the highest number of visitors flying from airports other than Gatwick or Manchester.\" For British gay men who don't live within commuting distance of a major city, it's cheaper and easier to fly to Gran Canaria than to spend a week clubbing in London or Manchester. There's also a beach, of course - and the weather is rather better. There is tremendous loyalty to both destination and tour operator. \"Our repeat business is something like eight times the travel industry average - it's extraordinary - but in return for that, expectations are high,\" says Harkavy. Going Places recently set up Travel Unlimited, a gay division of its telephone- sales operation Holidayline. It's the first mainstream company targeting the gay market. But there are few signs of others following their lead. First Choice says: \"Most travel operators are looking at the gay market with a view to how they can market to it in the future, but there's nothing at the moment.\" The gay visitor's typical day in Gran Canaria doesn't start early. Most exclusively-gay accommodation isn't in the concrete jungle of Playa del Ingles but in its bungalow suburb of Maspalomas, which is leafier, quieter and easier on the eye. But Maspalomas boasts one of the most spectacular beaches in the Canary Islands and gay visitors take full advantage. Gay beaches tend to be quieter, more remote and less spoilt by mass tourism. Maspalomas offers seclusion in abundance. There's a gay section of the rather windy beachfront, but there's also a substantial gay section in the vast dunes behind it. The dunes are the daytime counterpoint to the Yumbo Centre, big enough for everyone to have a dune each if they choose. Trees act as windbreaks and help create suntraps as well as offering privacy. It's no coincidence that the gay section is adjacent to the naturist area: both groups crave privacy and many gay men like to sunbathe naked. After a day on the beach, many gay men make their way to the public terrace in front of the Riu Palace Hotel in Playa del Ingles. It's a chance to see what the people from the next sand dune look like up close and to watch the sun set behind the Maspalomas lighthouse. Some go on to the Cita Centre for coffee and cakes at Caf\u00e9 Wien. It's one of the few culinary highlights of southern Gran Canaria and suggests Austrians are rather better at patisserie than they are at politics. After sunset, many take a disco nap to prepare for the night ahead. Dinner tends to be late, and it's often nothing special: few restaurants in Playa del Ingles rise above the steak and seafood mediocrity of the tourist menu. Soon it's 10:30pm again and time to go back to the Yumbo. It offers gay bars of every type - convivial places, cruisy ones and even bars for gay pensioners, who can have a waltz and a schnapps at Na Und. While straight visitors lap up the drag cabaret at Caf\u00e9 Labelle, gay men prefer the leather and feathers at Centre Stage, where every night is Julie Andrews night. But the nightlife doesn't really get going until around midnight, when the slicker, more international bars on the top floor start to fill up. Each pumps out the Euro hits on video: Ricky Martin, Aqua, maybe something with a harder edge. Tubos is the first to fill, then the crowd moves around to Mykonos before reaching the Metropole Disco. The process takes three hours. The crowd is younger than in the downstairs bars, with more evidence of time at the gym. Despite the absence - except at weekends - of Canarian men, this procession from one bar to another is the most Spanish feature of Gran Canaria's gay nightlife. Drinkers who linger too long in one bar will find it empties as the in-crowd moves on. At 4am, the upper level winds down and the large disco bars on the opposite side of the centre - XL and Kings - crank up the energy. Kings dances on until 6am; you haven't really done gay Gran Canaria until you've been there at the bitter end. No wonder the gay presence seems to melt away during the day. Gay men rarely have the best suntans on the plane home. Pink spots Five to be seen in Gran Canaria, Sitges, Ibiza and Mykonos have been established gay favourites since the 1970s. There was a hippy trail element to the original popularity of both Mykonos and Ibiza. Sitges is to Barcelona what Brighton is to London. With Spanish resorts, in particular, the price of packages is no higher now than in the 1980s. Sydney has grown as a gay destination for UK-based tourists since the arrival of charter flights and thanks to the strength of the pound. Its success came on strongly in the 1990s, and, of course, the profile of Mardi Gras - the world's biggest gay and lesbian carnival every February - just gets higher and higher. Five to watch Barcelona benefits from the same value factor as any Spanish destination. It's very close to Sitges (reachable via the local train network), so can easily combine as a two-centre break, and is a very gay-friendly city with good nightlife. Cape Town is the newest arrival - excellent nightlife and very cheap. There are gay-friendly safaris among other things, so it appeals to more than a bar-hopping crowd. Paris has always been a popular destination, but Eurostar has boosted its appeal since it came on stream. New York, again popular for a long time, has been given a recent boost by the strength of the pound and cheap flights. Bangkok dipped in popularity in the 1990s but is bouncing back. A lot of the seedier side has been eliminated. It is a stopover for Sydney, of course, and so benefits from the increased traffic to that hotspot.

      "bodyText": "The government last night traded blows with the German car giant BMW over the Rover sell-off as it emerged that up to 6,000 workers at Britain's biggest car plant could lose their jobs under drastic proposals to slash output unveiled by its new owners. The scale of the losses prompted Tony Blair to telephone BMW's chief executive, Joachim Milberg, to express a `great deal of disappointment and anger' at the shock sale of the factory at Longbridge, in Birmingham. The plant will begin running down production from Monday, with shifts being reduced at a cost to workers of about \u00a380 per month. Dozens of BMW managers have already been pulled out. The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers , who visited Longbridge yesterday, announced \u00a3152m in state aid to regenerate the West Midlands, suggesting that the government fears the worst. A task force, which will have its first meeting today, would advise workers and businesses affected by the sale, he added, and would report to him about the impact on the local economy within six weeks. Dismayed union leaders last night predicted that nearly three-quarters of the 8,500-strong Rover workforce would be axed. BMW yesterday continued its surprise reverse out of UK motor manufacturing when it confirmed the sale of its successful Land- Rover complex in Solihull to Ford for \u00a31.85bn. Downing Street made it clear that the prime minister was furious that Britain had been kept in the dark about BMW's sell-off plans. Ministers are angry that German officials were discussing the sell-off of Rover while they were negotiating with the European commission in Brussels for a pounds 152m aid package for Longbridge. `That is not the way the prime minister believes people should do business,' a Downing Street spokesman said. The German company blamed the strong pound for its decision to shed Longbridge and refused to accept the blame for loss-making Rover 's problems. `We reached the limit that we could tolerate,' a spokesman said. Professor Milberg said the high value of sterling made `an already very difficult situation even worse', as he reopened the row over Britain's membership of the euro. Government claims that it was unaware the high pound was fuelling a BMW rethink were undermined by Michael Heseltine, who disclosed that a director had warned him over dinner last month. `The government cannot begin to suggest that BMW were not concerned about this,' said the Tory former deputy prime minister and industry secretary. `The guy I spoke to made no secret of it.' Jon Moulton, the head of Alchemy Partners, which set up the MG Car Company to take over Longbridge, made it clear that it will concentrate on sports cars in the future, with new Lotus-style models, including a sporty saloon. Production will be around 40,000 in five years and peak on the most optimistic forecasts at under 100,000, compared to the current 180,000 vehicles-a-year output. Longbridge is carrying five months stock of the Rover 25 and 45 cars and the models will not be replaced. Mr Moulton accepted selling them would be difficult. `There are two groups of workers at Longbridge. There are people who will lose their jobs, which we bitterly regret but that it is inevitable,' he said. `There is another group of workers who will have greater opportunities and they will not be staring over their shoulders fearing redundancy.' Mr Byers said Alchemy was not a `done deal' and suggested a new buyer could be found. `I think people would be more confident if someone with an established reputation took over Longbridge. We will find out more in the next few weeks,' he said. After his plant visit, Mr Byers said: `I walked on the track at Longbridge and spoke to a number of men who have worked there for decades ...

Among other things he had in mind the Crusades, the Inquisition, holy wars, the torture and burning of heretics, ethnic cleansing and genocide, forced conversions of Indians and Africans, discrimination against women including their enslavement by excessive childbirth with resulting poverty and ill-health, and the Church's role in the Holocaust. </p> <p>Not all of these matters were explicitly mentioned - the Holocaust, for example, was left out - but they were all hinted, and in explanation of why the list was unspecific a Vatican spokesman said, \"Given the number of sins committed in the course of 20 centuries, it must necessarily be rather summary.\" </p> <p>Repentance means changing one's mind. Students of art history learn how to recognise the \"pentamenti\" in a painter's work: the alterations, over-paintings, erasures and adjustments detectable most clearly by X-rays, which reveal the painting's evolution and, indirectly therefore, its maker's intentions. One needs to X-ray the papal apology to understand its evolution. </p> <p>As long ago as 1994 the Pope mooted the idea of purging the Church's conscience, but in its circumspect way the Church required that a report first be prepared, to explore the precedents and consequences of such an action, and to assess how far the apology should go - after all, as the resulting document issued by the international theological commission pointed out, many of the sins were committed \"in the service of truth\", as for example the massacre of Cathars and the burning of heretics, who were in danger of getting deeper into the sin of heresy if they were not quickly despatched, for their own good, to Purgatory. (Some definitions: heresy = disagreeing with the Pope; truth = agreeing with the Pope.) </p> <p>The commission's quest for precedents must have been heartening, for the Pope turns out to be in good company: no less a personage than God was given to repenting, as when in Genesis 6:6 he repents that he had made man, and in 1 Samuel 15 that he had made Samuel king, and even - after a lecture from Moses - in Exodus 32:14 that he had been on the point of letting his wrath wax hot against his stiffnecked people. As various humanity-destroying floods, earthquakes and immolations attest, however, he did not repent often; which might explain the Church's 2,000-year delay in its own first effort. </p> <p>That God repented at all has been a problem for theologians, for there is an embarrassing contradiction between divine perfections and divine repentings. Apologetical writings on the subject accordingly have chapter headings like \"God repents, 1 Sam 15:35, but this does not mean he was mistaken or in error, 11 Psalms 110:4\". The theological commission ought to have taken this tack in the Papal apology: a form of words which more circumloquaciously said \"we were wrong but we weren't wrong\" would have done. </p> <p>\"Sinning is the best part of repentance,\" says an Arab proverb, and one suspects that the Church, in the heyday of its power and influence, would have given not a moment's consideration to the idea of repenting en masse (and in a mass) for its \"sins of 20 centuries\". In a lecture to Roman Catholics on \"teshuva\" Rabbi David Blumenthal observed that in addition to acceptance of one's sinfulness and remorse for it, repentance involves restitution. </p> <p>This opens an interesting possibility: will the Church, which is very rich, compensate its victims or their heirs now that it has acknowledged its sins against them? Restitution is not a canonical part of Catholic doctrine on repentance, but something Melancthon says suggests it could become so: he describes repentance as consisting of \"contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin... (and) faith... from which good works, which are the fruits of repentance, are bound to follow.\" This, at least, suggests how to test the sincerity of an apology; we wait with bated breath. </p> <p>An apology can sometimes help victims, at least in being a recognition of their suffering - and a modest revenge, for \"he punishes himself who repents of his deeds\" as Publilius Syrus said. But it does not repair the damage or reverse the injustices of history. When apologies are offered too late, or only because they have become unavoidable, they are worth little. How much better it would be if they had not been necessary in the first place. </p>",

In a lecture to Roman Catholics on \"teshuva\" Rabbi David Blumenthal observed that in addition to acceptance of one's sinfulness and remorse for it, repentance involves restitution. This opens an interesting possibility: will the Church, which is very rich, compensate its victims or their heirs now that it has acknowledged its sins against them? Restitution is not a canonical part of Catholic doctrine on repentance, but something Melancthon says suggests it could become so: he describes repentance as consisting of \"contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin... (and) faith... from which good works, which are the fruits of repentance, are bound to follow.\" This, at least, suggests how to test the sincerity of an apology; we wait with bated breath. An apology can sometimes help victims, at least in being a recognition of their suffering - and a modest revenge, for \"he punishes himself who repents of his deeds\" as Publilius Syrus said. But it does not repair the damage or reverse the injustices of history. When apologies are offered too late, or only because they have become unavoidable, they are worth little. How much better it would be if they had not been necessary in the first place.",

      "body": "<p>A secret plot has been hatched by senior Conservatives to prepare the ground for British withdrawal from the European Union, raising new doubts about William Hague's ability to hold his party together over Europe. </p> <p>A group of Eurosceptic Tory frontbenchers, who are determined to undermine Britain's place in Europe, have played a leading role in persuading a powerful United States senate committee to investigate the possibility of Britain unilaterally joining the North America free trade area. Such a move would lead to instant expulsion from the EU. </p> <p>Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, last night seized on the secret plan to claim that the Conservatives' policy of \"withdrawal by stealth\" had at last been exposed. </p> <p>Mr Cook said: \"William Hague's cover has been blown. Nobody can now take seriously his protestations that he wants Britain to remain in the EU when he he is secretly working to get Britain to join Nafta.\" </p> <p>The foreign secretary hit out when it emerged that the US senate's finance committee launched an investigation into possible British membership of Nafta after intense lobbying from a group of senior Tory Eurosceptics. </p> <p>These include John Redwood, who said yesterday that he received a \"warm reception\" in Washington last year while he was a member of the shadow cabinet. The group also included Iain Duncan Smith, the shadow defence secretary, and the rightwing backbencher Eric Forth, who is a close ally of the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo. </p> <p>Mr Redwood said that a series of trips to Washington by leading Tories had played an important role in persuading the senate committee to commission its investigation into British membership. </p> <p>\"There is growing opposition to a fortress Europe in the United States,\" Mr Redwood said. \"If low tariffs make sense in Europe why can't they make sense across the Atlantic?\" </p> <p>The Conservatives last night angrily rejected Mr Cook's claims that Mr Hague was behind a plot to use Nafta membership to force Britain out of the EU. </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Hague said: \"We believe that Britain should join Nafta but this should be done through the European Union. To claim that we are pushing for Britain to join Nafta unilaterally is a Millbank lie.\" </p> <p>The row between the foreign secretary and the Tories broke out after a team of officials from the US international trade commission, which is carrying out the Nafta investigation on behalf of the senate finance committee, arrived in London this week to launch their investigation. The Americans are meeting Eurosceptic groups such as the anti-single currency group Business for Sterling. </p> <p>Pro-Europeans believe that the Eurosceptic Tories have succeeded in pushing forward their \"withdrawal agenda\" by persuading the US senate that Britain could make a unilateral decision to join Nafta. </p> <p>The US commission's terms of reference talk about British membership of the North American free trade area, without making any reference to the EU. They talk of investigating \"the impact on the US economy of including the United Kingdom in a free trade arrangement\". </p> <p>Foreign office officials will tell US commission officials, when they meet next week, that a unilateral move is impossible because Britain can only set up trade deals through the EU. </p> <p>One source said: \"Our officials will stress the constitutional impossibility of Britain joining Nafta without leaving the EU.\" </p> <p>This was reinforced by Mr Cook. \"The fact is that that the overwhelming majority of our exports [52.7%] go to countries of the EU, while only 17% of our trade is with Nafta,\" the foreign secretary said. \"This shows that William Hague is prepared to jeopardise a very large number of British jobs for the sake of satisfying his party's extreme anti-European prejudices.\" </p> <p>Despite the Tories' dismissal of Mr Cook's claims, the disclosure of the role of senior Conservatives in the Nafta investigation will once again focus attention on Mr Hague's commitment to Europe. </p> <p>At last year's Tory conference, the party leader raised the possibility of a future Conservative government renegotiating Britain's European treaties, which was seen as code for withdrawal. </p> <p>Mr Hague's lurch towards extreme Euroscepticism was largely put down to pressure from Lady Thatcher, who hijacked the conference when she declared that all Britain's problems had come from the continent. </p> <p>The former prime minister underlined her contempt for the European Union yesterday by publicly supporting the rightwing peer Lord Pearson of Rannoch when he introduced a bill that would lay the ground for British withdrawal from the EU.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A secret plot has been hatched by senior Conservatives to prepare the ground for British withdrawal from the European Union, raising new doubts about William Hague's ability to hold his party together over Europe. A group of Eurosceptic Tory frontbenchers, who are determined to undermine Britain's place in Europe, have played a leading role in persuading a powerful United States senate committee to investigate the possibility of Britain unilaterally joining the North America free trade area. Such a move would lead to instant expulsion from the EU. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, last night seized on the secret plan to claim that the Conservatives' policy of \"withdrawal by stealth\" had at last been exposed. Mr Cook said: \"William Hague's cover has been blown. Nobody can now take seriously his protestations that he wants Britain to remain in the EU when he he is secretly working to get Britain to join Nafta.\" The foreign secretary hit out when it emerged that the US senate's finance committee launched an investigation into possible British membership of Nafta after intense lobbying from a group of senior Tory Eurosceptics. These include John Redwood, who said yesterday that he received a \"warm reception\" in Washington last year while he was a member of the shadow cabinet. The group also included Iain Duncan Smith, the shadow defence secretary, and the rightwing backbencher Eric Forth, who is a close ally of the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo. Mr Redwood said that a series of trips to Washington by leading Tories had played an important role in persuading the senate committee to commission its investigation into British membership. \"There is growing opposition to a fortress Europe in the United States,\" Mr Redwood said. \"If low tariffs make sense in Europe why can't they make sense across the Atlantic?\" The Conservatives last night angrily rejected Mr Cook's claims that Mr Hague was behind a plot to use Nafta membership to force Britain out of the EU. A spokesman for Mr Hague said: \"We believe that Britain should join Nafta but this should be done through the European Union. To claim that we are pushing for Britain to join Nafta unilaterally is a Millbank lie.\" The row between the foreign secretary and the Tories broke out after a team of officials from the US international trade commission, which is carrying out the Nafta investigation on behalf of the senate finance committee, arrived in London this week to launch their investigation. The Americans are meeting Eurosceptic groups such as the anti-single currency group Business for Sterling. Pro-Europeans believe that the Eurosceptic Tories have succeeded in pushing forward their \"withdrawal agenda\" by persuading the US senate that Britain could make a unilateral decision to join Nafta. The US commission's terms of reference talk about British membership of the North American free trade area, without making any reference to the EU. They talk of investigating \"the impact on the US economy of including the United Kingdom in a free trade arrangement\". Foreign office officials will tell US commission officials, when they meet next week, that a unilateral move is impossible because Britain can only set up trade deals through the EU. One source said: \"Our officials will stress the constitutional impossibility of Britain joining Nafta without leaving the EU.\" This was reinforced by Mr Cook. \"The fact is that that the overwhelming majority of our exports [52.7%] go to countries of the EU, while only 17% of our trade is with Nafta,\" the foreign secretary said. \"This shows that William Hague is prepared to jeopardise a very large number of British jobs for the sake of satisfying his party's extreme anti-European prejudices.\" Despite the Tories' dismissal of Mr Cook's claims, the disclosure of the role of senior Conservatives in the Nafta investigation will once again focus attention on Mr Hague's commitment to Europe. At last year's Tory conference, the party leader raised the possibility of a future Conservative government renegotiating Britain's European treaties, which was seen as code for withdrawal. Mr Hague's lurch towards extreme Euroscepticism was largely put down to pressure from Lady Thatcher, who hijacked the conference when she declared that all Britain's problems had come from the continent. The former prime minister underlined her contempt for the European Union yesterday by publicly supporting the rightwing peer Lord Pearson of Rannoch when he introduced a bill that would lay the ground for British withdrawal from the EU.",

But after a low key welcome in Canberra she was given a friendly reminder that while the republicans are down they are not out. Her tour - her first in Australia for eight years - began like clockwork when a Royal Australian Air Force VIP jet landed in a warm autumn evening at the Fairbairn base after collecting the monarch and her entourage of 32 from her chartered Qantas 747 in Sydney. The Queen was met on the tarmac by the governor general, Sir William Deane, the Australian prime minister, John Howard, and their wives. There was no red carpet, no national anthem, no military guard of honour, no 21-gun salute. While a few royal well-wishers lined the route between the airport and the governor general's official residence of Yarralumla, the local branch of the Australian Republican Movement stole their thunder with a large yellow and gold banner reading \"The Republic of the ACT [Australian Capital Territory] welcomes the Queen of England\". An ARM spokesman, Robin Poke, said he wanted to remind the Queen that the struggle for a republic continued. The singing of God Save the Queen by a handful of royalists outside the gates of Yarralumla sounded a little hollow as the royal Rolls-Royce sped into the vice-regal sanctuary to give the Queen a quiet weekend to get over jet lag. Prince Philip did not fly in from London with the party but arrived later in Canberra from the United States. However, there was one bright spot for traditionalists. Janette Howard, wife of the prime minister, an avowed republican, curtseyed to the Queen. It was a small but significant sign of how things have changed at the top. The last time the Queen arrived in 1992, Annita Keating, wife of the then prime minister, Paul Keating, refused to curtsey in what some tried to make out was a calculated republican snub. Despite the divisions caused by the republic debate, which was defeated by 45% to 55%, the royal tour does not so far appear to have stirred great passions from either side.

The Queen's first official appointment of her 13th tour of Australia is a meeting with Mr Howard today at Yarralumla while her first public appearance will be at a church service tomorrow.

That is where, with some of the most elegant cars of the 20th century, the German car maker this week consigned Rover, one of the most famous names in British motoring. </p> <p>A power struggle in the BMW boardroom, faced with huge losses at their British subsidiary, had left blood on the carpet there, thousands of people facing unemployment in the West Midlands and an angry government looking powerless in the face of big business. </p> <p>And so ended, after six years, the Munich-based company's ambition of using Rover to provide the economies of scale that would allow it to compete with the emerging automotive supergroups. </p> <p>The museum stands alongside the group's landmark headquarters - a building which is a monument to BMW's importance as one of Bavaria's most famous corporate sons. </p> <p>It is one of only two skyscrapers allowed by the Munich city fathers and it was within that 21-storey tower on Thursday morning that BMW's board made its fateful decision. The English Patient was simply not responding to treatment. Ailing Rover, into which the group had poured billions since it gazumped Honda to buy it from British Aerospace in 1994 would, in large part, have to go. </p> <p>But the process had taken a long time. It was six months ago that the takeover of the Longbridge car plant by Alchemy Partners was mooted privately during secret talks in Munich behind the backs of the British government and workforce. </p> <p>It was particularly galling for the government who were pushing Brussels to clear a \u00a3152m cash injection it hoped would guarantee Longbridge's future. And all the time BMW was looking to sell. </p> <p>The plan was codenamed Project Crufts by Jon Moulton and Eric Walters, who run Alchemy and hoped their takeover could be agreed during the dog show. It was not to be made public until it was too late to stop. </p> <p>The news of the takeover leaked out on Monday night when the presses at the Suddeutsche Zeitung began to roll. </p> <p>The edition carried a story which sent shockwaves through the motor industry in general and the West Midlands in particular. According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the BMW management was recommending the sale of the Longbridge plant in Birmingham, and the Rover name to a buyer which was \"not one of the established auto groups\". </p> <p>The impact was immediate. The Suddeutsche Zeitung is regarded in Germany as an influential newspaper with a track record of scoops about BMW. </p> <p>In the event the car group responded immediately. Though it did not exactly confirm the story, it acknowledged that plans to restructure Rover were being considered and that a sale was an option. </p> <p>The following day the Suddeutsche Zeitung did it again, lifting the lid on what was going on behind the scenes at BMW. </p> <p>It reported that following Thursday's meeting of the supervisory board - German companies have two boards, one made up of the operational management and the second supervisory board including representatives from shareholders and the workforce - three top executives would go. </p> <p>Even before Thursday's meeting of the supervisory board there had been a power struggle within BMW and the hawks - those who wanted to get rid of Rover - had won. However, when he went into the supervisory board meeting the management board chief Joachim Milberg, a tall grey-haired bespectacled man with a sufficiently academic air to make his title of professor more than a courtesy one, already had an exit strategy to put on the table. </p> <p>But how and when did BMW executives, who had been adamant that Rover would stay within BMW come to such a change of mind. </p> <p>After all, the issue should have been buried when a previous boardroom bust-up saw the departure of chairman Bernd Pischetsreider and his rival Wolfgang Reitzle. </p> <p>Immediately after he took over at BMW last February Prof Milberg put in place what Dr Thomas Gauly, the spokesman for the Quandt family which effectively controls BMW through a near 48% shareholding, \"a very exact and detailed\" analysis of Rover. </p> <p>Towards the end of last year, according to BMW executives, the German group received a number of approaches - including one from Alchemy - about Rover. It took a while, apparently, to sort the serious from the frivolous. </p> <p>At the same time it was becoming clear that BMW's strategy of turning Rover round was not going according to plan. Sales of the 75 model and the 25 and 45 were not going according to plan. The company could not shrug off it's old fashioned image. And instead of weakening - as BMW had apparently hoped early in 1998 - the pound strengthened further, making the cars more and more expensive abroad. </p> <p>By the time of the Geneva motor show it was clear that matters were coming to a crunch. Even then executives were letting it be known that some UK investment decisions were under threat - though the sometimes mixed messages emerging indicated the extent to which management was divided. Even heavier losses than in 1998, the row over state aid for Longbridge and government policy towards the single currency only added to the pressure. </p> <p>At Geneva Prof Milberg was talking then of restructuring Rover. Quite when restructuring turned to division is not entirely clear though Prof Milberg says, rather enigmatically, that the build-up to the decision \"took more than one day\". </p> <p>Some reports suggest that the Quandt family pushed for an end to the Rover affair. They were certainly in a position to do so. Though Johanna Quandt, the third wife of Guenther Quandt, the man credited with building up BMW, plays little active part in running the company her two children Susanne Klatten and Stefan Quandt, both in their 30s, sit on the supervisory board. </p> <p>Prof Milberg insisted that the plan for Rover came from the managing board and the Quandts responded \"positively\". According to Dr Gauly: \"It was Professor Milberg who prepared the Rover plan, he was the man who pushed it forward.\" The Quandt's, he insists, do not get involved in operational decisions. </p> <p>Prof Milberg said he consulted industry secretary Stephen Byers \"a couple of days\" ahead of the supervisory board meeting to tell him that BMW was \"considering various alternatives\" and to warn him that the situation was critical. </p> <p>Prof Milburg insisted that he had held talks with the government several weeks before the supervisory board meeting which approved the Rover break-up in a bid to get across just how serious the situation was. </p> <p>One of those alternatives was Alchemy which, judging by the reports in the Suddeusche Zeitung had, by Monday at the latest, turned its original approach into a concept which Prof Milberg could push through the management board and then at that fateful meeting on a grey cold blustery Munich day sell to the supervisory board as a face saving - if expensive - exit strategy. </p> <p>The BMW directors who ditched Rover could yet meet the fate of workers in the West Midlands as speculation grows that the German company has left itself open to takeover. </p> <p>Volkswagen is tipped as a potential suitor in an industry where big is beautiful as manufacturers pool resources in an industry suffering 25% overcapacity. </p> <p>Germany's Daimler-Benz and the US producer Chrysler have already teamed up while Renault of France has a large stake in Nissan of Japan. </p> <p>Sweden's Volvo is now part of Ford while a fortnight ago the US-based General Motors teamed up with the Italian giant Fiat. </p> <p>Back in London yesterday, Mr Moulton made it clear that Longbridge will soon end its reign as Britain's largest car plant - employing 8,500 staff directly and thousands more in ancillary businesses. </p> <p>He admitted large job losses are on their way and that output of the Rover 25 and 45 will be slowed and ended with no replacements. The future, he said, would be in aluminium MG sports cars, including a saloon, similar to those made by Lotus, with fewer than 100,000 produced on even the most optimistic forecasts against 180,000 vehicles now. </p> <p>The political fallout could trigger a political backlash against a humiliated Tony Blair and his party in many marginal seats after the government was left in the dark and then exposed as impotent. </p> <p>Stephen Byers, the industry secretary, is expected to travel to Germany next week for talks with BMW executives. </p> <p>The past week proved a nightmare for the once rising star of New Labour as he struggled to find out what was going on and never quite caught up with BMW or Alchemy. </p> <p>Mr Byers, in the West Midlands yesterday for talks with the Longbridge management and unions, announced a task force to deal with the fallout and help workers made redundant find new jobs. </p> <p>The decision, whatever the fighting talk about finding another buyer, suggests the government are resigned to Longbridge facing big cuts. </p> <p>The industrial fallout was witnessed in the BBC's Millbank studios yesterday morning after Mr Moulton and Sir Ken Jackson, head of the AEEU engineering union, appeared on Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>Astonished BBC staff witnessed Sir Ken, a trade unionist who puts great store on partnership with managers, jabbing his finger at Mr Moulton as he protested: \"I'm bloody disgusted at what's happening.\" </p> <p>It had not been a good week for a lot of people. </p> <p><strong>Rover's glorious past</strong></p> <p><strong> 1904 </strong> Rover produced its first car, an 8hp model. </p> <p><strong> 1906</strong> The Rover Company Ltd was founded. </p> <p><strong> 1912</strong> Rover offered a bigger selection of vehicles than any other firm, with cars from 100 guineas to \u00a3600. </p> <p><strong> 1924</strong> The 14/45 hp model made its debut at the Olympia motor show.

      "body": "<p>As literary deals are struck at the London International Book Fair, the book world's major trade show which kicks off tomorrow at Kensington Olympia, where can the reading public get the best deal when buying a book? </p> <p>The price war raging among internet booksellers as they battle for market share supremacy suggests you are likely to find the best cover price discounts by shopping online. </p> <p>But as a Jobs &amp; Money snapshot survey reveals, the story is not straightforward. Prices for popular best-selling titles vary enormously from vendor to vendor and while it is usually cheaper to buy from internet bookshops, no one online vendor seems to consistently offer the cheapest deals. What's more, in some instances you can get a better discount from high street retailers. </p> <p>The conclusion is that, if you know what books you want and you've got the time, it's worth shopping around for the best price on individual titles. </p> <p>Of course, many book lovers would agree that if your aim is to browse the shelves before choosing a book to buy, there is no online substitute for visiting a real store where you can handle the books, read the blurb and sample the texts. Buying from a real bookshop also gives you the advantage of being able to get the book on the spot rather than having to wait an average two days for delivery from an online vendor. </p> <p>In this Jobs &amp; Money survey, we compared prices for the top three books from the hardback and paperback fiction and non-fiction bestseller lists compiled by Bookwatch from data supplied by BookTrack's nationwide sample of sales from 4,600 outlets over seven days ending 26 February. </p> <p>First stop was the internet where a query about how to find the best book prices addressed to the Ask Jeeves site (<a href=\"http://www.ask.co.uk\">www.ask.co.uk</a>) linked me to the hugely time-saving and useful Shopgenie site (<a href=\"http://www.shopgenie.co.uk\">www.shopgenie.co.uk</a>) which searches online stores for the best prices on various goods. </p> <p>In its book section, you simply have to type in the author and title of your chosen book and specify whether you want prices for the hardback or paperback edition. One click of the mouse and, within a minute, the screen displays three charges - the price, P&amp;P cost and price including P&amp;P - for your requested book from seven internet booksellers. One more click and it will sort them into best buy order. Shopgenie compares prices for Amazon (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\">www.amazon.co.uk</a>); Alphabetstreet (<a href=\"http://www.alphabetstreet.infront.co.uk\">www.alphabetstreet.infront.co.uk</a>); Bol (<a href=\"http://www.bol.com\">www.bol.com</a>); Countrybookstore (<a href=\"http://www.countrybookstore.co.uk\">www.countrybookstore.co.uk</a>); the Internet Bookshop, part of WH Smith Online (<a href=\"http://www.bookshop.co.uk\">www.bookshop.co.uk</a>); the Book Place (<a href=\"http://www.thebookplace.com\">www.thebookplace.com</a>); and Waterstones Online (<a href=\"http://www.waterstones.co.uk\">www.waterstones.co.uk</a>). The results for the 12 bestselling titles varied enough to show that it is impossible to predict which vendor will be offering the best price, including post and packing, on any one title. So, if you want to buy a particular bestseller online, it is worth doing a quick search first to find out where you'll get the best deal. </p> <p>But if you want to buy several books at a time, it may be cheaper to stick to one supplier because of the minimum delivery charges levied by some online vendors. Free postage and packing is on offer from Alphabetstreet and Countrybookstore. </p> <p>For book deliveries to UK addresses, Amazon and Waterstones Online charge \u00a31.95 plus 50p per book; Bol charges a flat \u00a32.95 per delivery; the Internet Bookshop charges 15% of the ordered books' full price with a minimum charges of \u00a31.95 and maximum \u00a36; and the Book Place charges \u00a32 for the first book plus \u00a31.75 for each subsequent book. </p> <p>After obtaining prices from internet vendors, we asked Waterstones and WHSmith for their instore prices for the same list of bestsellers. Neither retailer charges the same for titles in store as via their internet outlets. </p> <p>One could argue that to be scrupulously fair, when com paring the high street store prices with internet bookseller prices one should add the cost of return travel to the nearest branch. </p> <p>Taking our sample of 12 bestsellers, Alphabetstreet offered the cheapest price including delivery charges for four titles (including one joint best price with Countrybookstore), the Internet Bookshop for three, Waterstones high street stores for two, Countrybookstore for two (including one joint with Alphabetstreet) and Amazon and Waterstones Online each took credit for one best price. </p> <p>If you have an independent bookshop nearby, one final tip is to check whether they are willing to match any best price you find elsewhere, including those on offer from online booksellers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As literary deals are struck at the London International Book Fair, the book world's major trade show which kicks off tomorrow at Kensington Olympia, where can the reading public get the best deal when buying a book? The price war raging among internet booksellers as they battle for market share supremacy suggests you are likely to find the best cover price discounts by shopping online. But as a Jobs &amp; Money snapshot survey reveals, the story is not straightforward. Prices for popular best-selling titles vary enormously from vendor to vendor and while it is usually cheaper to buy from internet bookshops, no one online vendor seems to consistently offer the cheapest deals. What's more, in some instances you can get a better discount from high street retailers. The conclusion is that, if you know what books you want and you've got the time, it's worth shopping around for the best price on individual titles. Of course, many book lovers would agree that if your aim is to browse the shelves before choosing a book to buy, there is no online substitute for visiting a real store where you can handle the books, read the blurb and sample the texts. Buying from a real bookshop also gives you the advantage of being able to get the book on the spot rather than having to wait an average two days for delivery from an online vendor. In this Jobs &amp; Money survey, we compared prices for the top three books from the hardback and paperback fiction and non-fiction bestseller lists compiled by Bookwatch from data supplied by BookTrack's nationwide sample of sales from 4,600 outlets over seven days ending 26 February. First stop was the internet where a query about how to find the best book prices addressed to the Ask Jeeves site (www.ask.co.uk) linked me to the hugely time-saving and useful Shopgenie site (www.shopgenie.co.uk) which searches online stores for the best prices on various goods. In its book section, you simply have to type in the author and title of your chosen book and specify whether you want prices for the hardback or paperback edition. One click of the mouse and, within a minute, the screen displays three charges - the price, P&amp;P cost and price including P&amp;P - for your requested book from seven internet booksellers. One more click and it will sort them into best buy order. Shopgenie compares prices for Amazon (www.amazon.co.uk); Alphabetstreet (www.alphabetstreet.infront.co.uk); Bol (www.bol.com); Countrybookstore (www.countrybookstore.co.uk); the Internet Bookshop, part of WH Smith Online (www.bookshop.co.uk); the Book Place (www.thebookplace.com); and Waterstones Online (www.waterstones.co.uk). The results for the 12 bestselling titles varied enough to show that it is impossible to predict which vendor will be offering the best price, including post and packing, on any one title. So, if you want to buy a particular bestseller online, it is worth doing a quick search first to find out where you'll get the best deal. But if you want to buy several books at a time, it may be cheaper to stick to one supplier because of the minimum delivery charges levied by some online vendors. Free postage and packing is on offer from Alphabetstreet and Countrybookstore. For book deliveries to UK addresses, Amazon and Waterstones Online charge \u00a31.95 plus 50p per book; Bol charges a flat \u00a32.95 per delivery; the Internet Bookshop charges 15% of the ordered books' full price with a minimum charges of \u00a31.95 and maximum \u00a36; and the Book Place charges \u00a32 for the first book plus \u00a31.75 for each subsequent book. After obtaining prices from internet vendors, we asked Waterstones and WHSmith for their instore prices for the same list of bestsellers. Neither retailer charges the same for titles in store as via their internet outlets. One could argue that to be scrupulously fair, when com paring the high street store prices with internet bookseller prices one should add the cost of return travel to the nearest branch. Taking our sample of 12 bestsellers, Alphabetstreet offered the cheapest price including delivery charges for four titles (including one joint best price with Countrybookstore), the Internet Bookshop for three, Waterstones high street stores for two, Countrybookstore for two (including one joint with Alphabetstreet) and Amazon and Waterstones Online each took credit for one best price. If you have an independent bookshop nearby, one final tip is to check whether they are willing to match any best price you find elsewhere, including those on offer from online booksellers.",

      "body": "<p>Personal finance providers are failing to rise to the internet challenge and the market is suffering. Industry magazine Retail Finance Strategies ranked the websites of the top 100 UK financial services providers in terms of what they provide to customers and found most of them lacking. </p> <p>\"The majority of financial sites have sparse functionality and limited content, while design and branding is either over-ambitious to the detriment of site navigation or so ill-conceived that it damages the image of the company as a whole,\" says Edward Humphrey, editor of Retail Finance Strategies. \"Despite the innovations of a select few, the vast majority show an alarming lack of strategic planning.\" </p> <p>Axa, HSBC and Standard Life Bank were among the worst scorers. Out of a possible 100 points, the survey gave them only, respectively, 56 points, 47 and 62. </p> <p>Retail Finance Strategies pointed to these websites' limited functionality - customers can get online quotes but not buy over the internet - and clumsy and confusing navigation as features which let them down. </p> <p>Some companies were also accused of playing catch up to keep their investors happy. Mr Humphrey says: \"All the internet ventures announced during the AGM season seem to be more about keeping analysts and shareholders happy, not the customers.\" </p> <p>Some sites, naturally, fared better than others. Nationwide Building Society topped the list, scoring 91 out of 100. </p> <p>The ability to buy almost all Nationwide products, including mortgages, loans and credit cards through the internet was praised by the report's authors. High quality content, links to other sites, including its own football site - the building society is a major sponsor of football in the UK - and the fact that Nationwide is an internet service provider all made for extra brownie points. </p> <p>Citibank, Egg and Natwest came second, third and fourth.

      "bodyText": "Personal finance providers are failing to rise to the internet challenge and the market is suffering. Industry magazine Retail Finance Strategies ranked the websites of the top 100 UK financial services providers in terms of what they provide to customers and found most of them lacking. \"The majority of financial sites have sparse functionality and limited content, while design and branding is either over-ambitious to the detriment of site navigation or so ill-conceived that it damages the image of the company as a whole,\" says Edward Humphrey, editor of Retail Finance Strategies. \"Despite the innovations of a select few, the vast majority show an alarming lack of strategic planning.\" Axa, HSBC and Standard Life Bank were among the worst scorers. Out of a possible 100 points, the survey gave them only, respectively, 56 points, 47 and 62. Retail Finance Strategies pointed to these websites' limited functionality - customers can get online quotes but not buy over the internet - and clumsy and confusing navigation as features which let them down. Some companies were also accused of playing catch up to keep their investors happy. Mr Humphrey says: \"All the internet ventures announced during the AGM season seem to be more about keeping analysts and shareholders happy, not the customers.\" Some sites, naturally, fared better than others. Nationwide Building Society topped the list, scoring 91 out of 100. The ability to buy almost all Nationwide products, including mortgages, loans and credit cards through the internet was praised by the report's authors. High quality content, links to other sites, including its own football site - the building society is a major sponsor of football in the UK - and the fact that Nationwide is an internet service provider all made for extra brownie points. Citibank, Egg and Natwest came second, third and fourth. All were deemed to have good functionality and an easy navigation system. These results are made more pertinent by the findings of Datamonitor market analysts on what makes people use internet banking. The analysts conclude that the number of internet bankers will grow by 30% in the next five years, reaching 5.3m, and that the biggest determinant in who these people bank with will be the level of service they get. The rise of tailor-made products and increasing competition over rates means the only way internet banks can distinguish themselves is in the service they give their customers, it says. It also found that online users of financial services tend to be young and know what the internet can do and expect their banks and fund managers to know as well. Additional services such as online finance guides, homepage customisation and the ability to access accounts through internet service providers like Yahoo and AOL are ways of giving a better service through the website, says the report. Offering competitors' products on your website was also flagged up as good customer service. Datamonitor believes that if customers can access other companies' banking products through one website, they are more likely to use that website for all their internet banking. Banks were the most consistent performers in the Retail Finance Strategies study, with the top 10 banks all scoring 77 points or more. The top 10 building societies, on the other hand ranged between 91 points to 58. The top 10 fund managers received similar rankings to the building societies. In the number one spot was Fidelity Investments with 84 points out of 100. Perpetual, in 10th place, scored 58 points. The range of points for the top 10 insurers was tighter, with the number one insurer, Legal &amp; General, being awarded 83 points and the number 10 insurer, Skandia Life, getting 66.",

      "body": "<p>There ought to be two overriding objectives in next week's budget: the need to find money to finance much higher spending on health and education, and measures to bring down the value of the pound. There is now strong public support for higher public spending, as reflected in a poll in this week's Economist, showing that Britain is unique among 17 countries surveyed in having a majority of people prepared to pay tax to fund better services. An impressive 91% wanted more spent on health, and 81% more on education.</p> <p>On the strong pound, the government - after wilfully neglecting the issue - has been shamed into considering it by political repercussions from the breakup of Rover's Longbridge operations. BMW cited the overvaluation of the pound as a major factor in its decision to shed its troublesome subsidiary - a move that seems bound to cost jobs in the area. Here is a brutal reminder to Labour, already reeling from claims that it is neglecting its heartlands, that the 16 seats won from the Conservatives in the West Midlands in 1997 could be vulnerable if it is seen to abandon manufacturing to the vagaries of the markets.</p> <p>But can anything be done? As he puts the final touches to his speech, Gordon Brown could be forgiven for feeling imprisoned by his own success. A combination of fiscal restraint (or raising taxes as Mr Hague would put it) and stronger than expected economic growth has left him surfing on a tidal wave of a budget surplus - around \u00a310bn - that no previous Labour chancellor would even have dared to dream about. The trouble is he cannot easily spend it for fear that by doing so he might overheat the economy. Raising taxes would be one option - but hardly an easy one when Mr Hague is trying to turn lower taxation into a moral crusade. Nor is it an easy economic one at a time when the treasury fears that the economy is overheating. If the chancellor increases spending to improve education and the health service, unfunded by higher taxes, then the economy may expand so fast that the Bank of England will be forced to put interest rates up yet again. That could force up sterling still higher thereby turning the demise of key parts of manufacturing - and farming - into a rout.</p> <p>Truth to tell, what is really needed now is not lower but higher taxes so that fiscal policy can assume more of the job of cooling down the overheating economy. That would create the conditions that would enable the Bank of England to lower interest rates, which are now nearly twice as high as those in the rest of Europe. Most of the proceeds of higher taxes should be used to finance the improvements in education and health that the citizens of the UK clearly want. The rest can be used to take money out of the economy so that higher interest rates do not need to be used to do it. This is not an easy thing for any chancellor to do with a general election looming on the horizon next year, but if the result is that this year's expected economic growth of over 3% (way above the 2.5% regarded as sustainable) is reined back to something more realistic, then everyone will gain in the long term.</p> <p>Mr Brown has a matchless talent for raising taxes by stealth so that hardly anyone notices. He now needs to show a matching skill in precision targeting on the fiscal side, so that his tax increases hit the economy only where it needs to be hit. Far better to increase the higher rates of stamp duty, or even to introduce a modest capital gains tax on house sales - which would dampen the southern housing boom - than to take the blunderbuss of interest rates to spray bullets across the whole economy, manufacturing industry and all.</p> <p>The chancellor has been extremely astute in redistributing income from the better off to the working poor and in encouraging the unemployed back to work without, at least until recently, unduly upsetting Daily Mail readers. He has plenty of scope to make for further stealthy incursions - making the rich pay their fair share of national insurance contributions, for instance, and, maybe, raising money from increases in the value of land. And wouldn't most people be prepared to see more tax imposed on their estates when they are dead, if that brought the reward of better health facilities now that might prolong their lives?</p> <p>Budgets need to redesign not just the economy but society too. It is one year ago today that the prime minister committed Labour to eliminating child poverty within the next 20 years. By the end of this parliament, Labour will have lifted almost 1m children above the poverty line (half average income). But that still leaves 3.8m to go. A combination of welfare to work schemes, increases in child benefits and children's allowances for income support claimants, and minimum pay and new childcare allowances have all helped. But now the difficulties begin. There are no more easy redistribution options, like the married couple's allowance, left. Mr Brown has promised an integrated child credit, but so far we have had no firm figures. A special allowance for children under five, the stage in their lives in which parents are normally most stretched, would be one welcome relief. But what is really needed is a coherent strategy plan on how the chancellor aims to accomplish the goal, with an open invitation to the Tories to sign up to it.</p> <p>Labour's second most ambitious social goal - lifting health spending to the European average over the next six years - is still stuck in a statistical quagmire. There can be no backtracking now. It was Mr Blair who said British health spending was too low at the moment, and his government would bring it up to the European average. That implies annual rises above 5% for each of the next five years. The prime minister will be aware of how much damage the government's squeeze on health in its first two years eroded public confidence. From being Labour's strongest card, health has now slumped, with a startling 41% in a Guardian/ICM poll believing the NHS is getting worse - and only 14% of respondents seeing any improvement.</p> <p>Labour's first priority - education, education, education - remains desperately short of funds. More has been invested. There is good news in the primary sector, particularly the advance in literacy and numeracy standards. But even after Labour's infamous claim of a \u00a319bn increase, rightly exploded in Nick Davies's Guardian series on schools earlier this month, the government still spends less of national income on education than John Major did in his first year as prime minister. This budget gives Gordon Brown the chance to recapture the loyalty of Labour's heartlands while retaining his reputation as an iron chancellor. He should go for it.</p>",

In a race that looks close, he is the front-running candidate of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive party (DPP).</p> <p>Despite China's sabre-rattling - which included a threat that force might be used if Taiwan indefinitely avoided unification talks - unofficial soundings still suggested yesterday that Mr Chen was maintaining his narrow lead.</p> <p>His two main rivals are James Soong, an independent, and Lien Chan, the candidate for the ruling Nationalist (Kuomintang or KMT) party and the man Beijing is believed to prefer.</p> <p>The KMT's television adverts portray Mr Chen as likely to \"lead Taiwan into turmoil\" because he is resisting Chinese demands for unification talks.

      "bodyText": "China is about to discover whether its denunciations of the pro-independence candidate in today's Taiwanese presidential election have intimidated the voters or - as in 1996 when Beijing's navy fired missiles offshore before the ballot - have provoked a defiant backlash on the island. On the eve of today's vote in Taiwan, William Cohen - the US defence secretary who is currently visiting Japan - said that if China ratcheted up the pressure on Taipei to abandon its independence, that would increase demands in the US congress that more arms be supplied to Taiwan. In Washington, the state department said it was urging \"prudence and patience\" on Beijing, and reiterated that force was not the way to deal with differences over Taiwan's status. The vote count in Taiwan starts tonight, with most eyes on the tally for Chen Shui-bian, the man who has Beijing rattled. In a race that looks close, he is the front-running candidate of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive party (DPP). Despite China's sabre-rattling - which included a threat that force might be used if Taiwan indefinitely avoided unification talks - unofficial soundings still suggested yesterday that Mr Chen was maintaining his narrow lead. His two main rivals are James Soong, an independent, and Lien Chan, the candidate for the ruling Nationalist (Kuomintang or KMT) party and the man Beijing is believed to prefer. The KMT's television adverts portray Mr Chen as likely to \"lead Taiwan into turmoil\" because he is resisting Chinese demands for unification talks. He has retorted by urging the voters to \"use your ballots to ward off the KMT's missiles.\" For the second day, the government dug into a previously untouched stabilisation fund to shore up Taiwan's stock market, jittery at China's threats and the possibility of a president from outside the ruling party so familiar to investors, the KMT. At tumultuous evening rallies in the capital last night, Mr Chen's supporters hailed him as a \"real Taiwanese\" who would lead the island away from the \"black gold\" corruption of the KMT. Mr Soong, the independent, was praised by his camp as \"a man who gets things done\", while Mr Lien's supporters insisted that only he can deal with Beijing. Mr Chen sought to defuse Beijing's attacks by promising to lead a mixed delegation, including his opponents, to China if he is elected. He also pledged that as president he would \"stop taking part\" in the activities of the DPP. The current president, Lee Teng-hui, mocked Mr Chen's recent offer of talks with Beijing. \"First Number 5 (Mr Chen's position on the ballot paper) talks of independence\", he told supporters, \"then when China threatens force he says something else. Going to Beijing would just make Taiwan lose face.\" Looking for a way to stop a Chen victory, senior KMT figures have switched to Mr Soong, the independent, in the last two days as Mr Lien appeared to be losing ground. They appealed to the voters to \"dump Lien and save Soong\". The Lien campaign's tactics suggested increasing nervousness that the KMT may finally lose the presidency - though it still dominates the island's current legislature. Beijing kept silent yesterday having last raised the temperature on Wednesday when the Chinese prime minister, Zhu Rongji, warned Taiwanese voters to \"make the right choice\", saying that otherwise they \"might not have the chance to regret it.\" One Taiwanese official noted sarcastically that Beijing's denunciation of the DPP opposition gave the appearance of a new \"united front\" between the Chinese Communists and the KMT - who were allies during two periods before the civil war. Analysts say that China is deeply frustrated because all three main candidates see Taiwan as effectively a separate state, though only Mr Chen has so far dared to call it \"independent\". Mr Lien supports President Lee's current formula of \"state-to-state relations\" with China which enraged Beijing last year, while Mr Soong says that the relationship is \"quasi- international\". The popular mood is in favour of maintaining the status quo without a formal declaration.",

      "body": "<p>Here in New York, I have been put in charge of a small tropical fish. Its owner has gone to Los Angeles to organise Vanity Fair's annual Oscars party, and won't be back until the end of the month. Her parting instructions were minimal. I was asked just to sprinkle a little fish food on it from time to time. That was all. I wasn't told how much food to give it or how often (if at all) to change its water. </p> <p>I have never looked after a fish before, and everyone tells me it is a difficult task. For example, fish do not know how to stop eating: if you give them too much food, they burst. And changing a fish's water is a delicate operation: not only is the fish easily lost in the process, but the water has to be the right temperature or it may die. It may well die anyway, of course. Fish usually do. </p> <p>This fish has so far contented itself with occasionally pretending to be dead. At other times, it is quite frisky. But it has very little space to be frisky in - its home is a square glass jar on top of a desk; so small and square that it cannot even do circles. A visitor to the office the other day said he thought that its owner should be charged with fish abuse. But I don't suppose he knows any more about fish than I do, and the size of the jar is probably just right for a fish of this particular kind. </p> <p>It is not a colourful fish. In fact, it is completely black. But it is curious to look at, having several seemingly superfluous fins almost as big as its little body. It's a bit like several fishes stuck together. This appearance suggests rarity - and therefore considerable expense if it should die and have to be replaced before its owner returns from Hollywood. Maybe it is a million-dollar fish and we will have to sell the house in London. </p> <p>When I aired this anxiety to Chris Garrett, the managing editor of Vanity Fair, she told me a cautionary tale about a dog that was flown from Europe to New York to be re-united with its lady owner. It travelled in a crate in the hold, but turned out on arrival to be dead. </p> <p>The airline staff could not face the idea of presenting the owner with a corpse, so they rang her to say that her dog was now arriving on a later flight and spent the time thus gained searching the pet shops of New York for one that looked the same. Returning triumphant from their mission, they replaced the dead dog in the crate with a living one, and told the owner that her dog was now ready for collection. When she arrived and saw it, she shrieked and then fainted. Her dog had died in Europe, and she had been bringing it home for burial. </p> <p>There is little relevance in this story to my dilemma, but I was much amused to hear it. I suspect that fish anxiety is widespread. In the 80s, when President Reagan was about to hold his first meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev in Switzerland, he rented a villa from the Aga Khan on the shore of Lake Geneva. One of the Aga Khan's children had left a note in the house asking him to keep an eye on the goldfish. At the appointed time, the President's chief of staff, Donald Regan, came by to pick him up and take him to the historic summit. He found Mr Reagan standing gravely in front of the fish tank. \"Don, we've got a problem,\" he said. One of the goldfish was lying dead on the bottom. So, as the peace of the world hung in the balance, members of the President's staff were urgently dispatched to find a replacement. </p> <p> If only the fish in my care were a humble goldfish, instead of this strange, multi-finned specimen, I would have rather less to worry about. In case you are wondering how I find myself in this situation, the answer is that I am spending a month in New York working at Vanity Fair, thanks to the kindness of its editor, Graydon Carter. By the time you read this, he and all of his senior staff will have gone to Hollywood for the great Oscars extravaganza. It is the most popular party of the year, and Carter writes in the current issue of his magazine that he has been besieged by people angling for invitations. </p> <p>I haven't been one of them, though. I am perfectly happy where I am; and anyway, I have an onerous duty to perform here in New York.</p>",

On the other (right) hand, the newsprint moralists were getting themselves into a similar squirmy state alongside such Amockalypsists (my word: yes, I know it doesn't quite work) as Mrs Victoria Gillick, who chose, somewhat insanely, to view sexual generosity as a sign of the decline of the West. This was when the Daily Mail really stepped up the why-oh-why? editorials, and it hasn't stopped whining yet. </p> <p>Surveying both contingents in the gleefully despairing gal\u00e8re , I could never help but recall a line from a Sparks song: \"My parents think the world is cruel/I think that they prefer it cruel.\" The fact is that most mildly intelligent people - of which the media, the arts and entertainment are mostly composed - feel too much like peasants if they are optimistic; they want to be the cerebral equivalent of pale and interesting. (Poor Geri Halliwell, with her endless attempts at being \"deep\", is the most pitiful sufferer from this syndrome.) Therefore, they see demons everywhere, and shout about them ceaselessly; they are the Hoarse Men Of The Amockalypse, who see imminent disaster as little more than aftershave - splash it all over, feel real big. </p> <p>Since the fall of Communism, penny-a-line alarmists have been looking around for some equally horrid enemy to blame for the ills of the world - and, hopefully, the end of the world, or at least the decline of western civilisation. They periodically try women, gays and immigrants - but that makes them look like big bullies, because women, gays and immigrants are so prone to getting themselves beaten up and killed. In recent months, an enemy has been located who isn't at all weak and vulnerable, but apparently big and strong. The new middlebrow demon is Celebrity, which, like Communism before it, is apparently waiting around every corner to destroy all that is decent and good in our sceptered isle. Celebrity, they say, is the beast that will swallow liberal democracy whole: in a nightmarish Day Of The Locust-type scenario, we all trample each other underfoot trying to get nearer to the healing flame of fame. And this all started in the 80s, apparently! </p> <p>Myself, I'm not convinced. I believe that people have more contempt and less adoration for the famous now than they have ever had. Think back to the 20s: women killed themselves when Valentino died. Does anyone really believe that Brad Pitt's demise will trigger a rash of suicides? The celebrity stalker was unknown until very recently. In the 50s, Marilyn Monroe's private number was actually in the New York phone book, so trusting was she that no one wanted to harm her. The desire of stars to become literally naked in the eyes of millions of strangers - think of the sublime (J Lopez) and the ridiculous (G Halliwell) in that Versace dress - can only aggravate the contempt that familiarity breeds. </p> <p>People who rail against celebrity will feel a lot happier if they understand that it's not they who are playing us, but we who are mocking them - as we once toured through Bedlam or baited village idiots - for making such shows of themselves. Sure, they're well paid, but if one's need for attention is so great that one will go out almost naked, money's never going to fill that hole. Contrary to the why-oh-whiners, the cult of celebrity doesn't damage anyone but the celebrities themselves. The rest of us go on with our daily lives and big loves, while they become their masks, often to the destruction of their real lives and loves. </p> <p>And the more educated you are - the more \"equipped\" to do something more worthwhile - the worse the effect of celebrity is going to be on you, because you know you're punching below your weight, and you feel worthless. That's why Stephen Fry \"suffers\" so much from his celebrity, whereas Posh Spice is obviously completely in her element with hers; like Madonna, \"famous\" was all she wanted to be and all she was fit to be. It's only when you're fit to be something else (Marilyn a great actress, Judy Garland a great singer, moi a great writer) that the trouble starts. Look at Vanessa Feltz - a woman with a first in English literature from Cambridge could have lived a really fulfilling life as a plain academic, single or married to an equally plain, non-flash male academic. But so swept up by the lure of fame was Feltz that, though obviously aware that her raw material is hardly the stuff that dreams are made of, she felt the need to throw her education to the winds and make a living as a sort of ambulatory archive of all that is loud, greedy, neurotic, pushy. </p> <p> As a celebrity, Feltz is about as celebrated as leprosy; as a popular TV personality, she is about as popular as piles. The things that defined her - her fatness and her happy family life - have now melted into air. Yet she now models the thin, unhappy self as though there is a real demand for it, not realising that a thin Vanessa Feltz has about as much point as a chocolate teapot. Everywhere we turn, we hear her banging on that \"telly\" is her passion, and now the BBC is going to pour even more good licence payers money after bad in order to further her crazed dreams of populism, when it is obvious to even the blindest soul that the only truly entertaining thing about the poor wretch is not the dismal programmes she propels on to the screen, but the car-crash that is her private life. It is for this service that she is rewarded with millions: for proving, as surely as any medieval mummers play, that pride comes before a fall and that money can't buy you love. </p> <p>If any celeb-bashing columnist really wants such a job, they can always go and spill their dirtiest, deepest secrets to the Sundays and get one. But I believe they should count their blessings - and not just their wordage - when next tempted to pillory the poor Personality. There, but for a decent agent, go all of us.</p>",

But I believe they should count their blessings - and not just their wordage - when next tempted to pillory the poor Personality. There, but for a decent agent, go all of us.",

Rosemary was identified with a handful of high-profile cases that made her a hate figure for loyalists and RUC officers, but her day-to-day work involved the rights and needs of many local people, Protestant and Catholic. Her firm dealt with all the mundane things people require from a solicitor. She worked with mixed community groups and with the people who perhaps have the hardest time getting a hearing in Northern Ireland, the travellers.</p> <p>It is unlikely, however, that this work got her killed. Most of us who knew her, and to whom she spoke about the threats she received, believe that the hands of the British state are not clean in this matter. The British government and the chief constable were well aware of those threats, including a handwritten one, a copy of which was forwarded by the Committee for the Administration of Justice to minister Adam Ingram, who passed it on to the chief constable, Ronnie Flanagan. The government refused to include her in the Key Persons' Protection Scheme.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the anniversary of her death, a petition bearing 100,000 signatures, calling for an independent inquiry, was delivered to Downing Street. Sadly, the event lost the battle for coverage in the British media. Rosemary did get the odd mention, however, because a man arrested by police investigating her murder was charged with weapons offences and membership of the Loyalist Volunteer Force. This man, who may or may not face charges directly related to Rosemary's murder, was at that time a serving member of the Royal Irish Regiment. The RIR is notorious for overt loyalism and the abuse of the few Catholics in it.</p> <p>In County Armagh, the RIR work closely with the RUC. On the night when the bomb was attached to Rosemary's car, local people report that there was a remarkable level of activity by the security forces. Efforts by police to explain away helicopter activity as a routine pass over the neighbouring Kilwilkee estate, contrast with residents' reports of helicopters hovering directly over the quiet suburban close where Rosemary lived, for a period of about six hours. People also saw large numbers of soldiers in the surrounding fields, no doubt just having a lie down.</p> <p>Perhaps this doesn't ring any alarm bells with you, despite the fact that a heightened security presence in the run-up to the state murder of human rights activists is the pattern the world over. You might not even be impressed that Rosemary had received death threats from RUC officers. A young reporter, interviewing me the other day, asked: \"The fact that RUC officers threatened her doesn't mean they killed her does it?\" Well, perhaps not, but a death threat might be regarded as a lead worth following up. But I suppose it's not much use handing the RUC a suspect on a plate if the suspect is the RUC.</p> <p>This is why people all over the world, including the UN, Amnesty International and the law societies of England and Wales, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, call for an international inquiry into this murder. Even if no security service personnel were involved, which I very much doubt, the fact that the investigation is based in Lurgan RUC station makes it more or less pointless. The contempt for Rosemary from many of the officers there, observed by the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, means that the investigation is tainted at best.</p> <p>Yes, it was taken over by British police officers under Colin Port, but weeks after it had started. First we were told the chief constable of Kent, David Phillips, was running it, excitingly assisted by the FBI. Phillips's mostly-absent involvement was quietly phased out. The Feds hung around for a bit as observers and then said their work was done. The only substantive thing that appeared to happen in those crucial weeks was an advert in the local press calling for witnesses but giving the wrong date and advertising a phone line that was left unmanned. Oh, and officers called at the office of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, to ask if they had an original copy of the hand-written death threat. Somewhat late but at least they took an interest.</p> <p>Colin Port inherited an investigation designed by Lurgan RUC, including a team of RUC officers, dedicated to investigating collusion. Port has reduced but not ended RUC involvement and is still working out of the same building. With the best will in the world, he hasn't a hope of being able to conduct the investigation in a way that could uncover more than the partial truth.</p> <p>I'm sure a couple of local loyalist headbangers will go down for this, but the issue will not go away.

      "body": "<p>Deep in the Siberian permafrost, a 47-year-old male mammoth lay entombed. Like many of its brothers and sisters that roamed northern climes during the ice age 20,000 years ago, it had, in life, resembled the elephant. It possessed a trunk, tusks, and a sexy sashay as it went on its way to a career of ball balancing and tutu wearing in prehistoric circuses. Naturally, this was many years before Stalin banned capitalist circuses in Siberia for all mammals, mammoths in particular. </p> <p>The mammoth was bigger than any elephant. Its tusks were about three metres long. Neanderthal hunters rarely hung mammoth tusks over their mantlepieces for fear that they would ruin the plasterwork. Hence the tradition for fish in display cases in early domestic decoration. The mammoth smelled of urine even when the Siberian air did its best to neutralise such niffs. Unlike the elephant, it was innocent of the pleasure of eating a banana messily. </p> <p>The mammoth often cut a doleful figure as it lolloped across the tundra in search of nutritious plant life. It was so burly that it knew no enemy but man. Sometimes, the death toll that resulted from climactic changes was so severe that the mammoth suffered from depression. As it migrated and evolved, the mammoth grew thick hair all over its body and its ears shrank from large flaps to little lugs. The mammoth, then, was uncannily like Frank Dobson. </p> <p>In Raising the Mammoth (Discovery), a team of French, Russian, American and Dutch men with parkas and PhDs decided they would dig the mammoth out of the ground in a cube of permafrost and fly the thing by helicopter to a nearby city. It would then be deposited in a man-made underground cavern. </p> <p>Cynics might have suggested that to move a 6 tonne block of cold earth and long-dead hairy monster from one Siberian hole to another was the height of futility. But this wasn't a futile excavation. Oh no. Scientists, speaking with the misplaced eagerness of Richard Attenborough in Jurassic Park, believed that if they could isolate a single strand of mammoth DNA, it wouldn't be long before mammoths once more foraged in the tundra. In no time at all, they would be causing gridlock on the North Circular and placing great strain on cafe facilities in Paris. Other scientists waxed snooty about such visions. But everyone with a paleontology qualification in this programme seemed to agree that we could learn a great deal about prehistoric mammalian lifestyles from inspecting the big fellow's internal organs. </p> <p>It took a long time to dig this mammoth out of the ground. Two hours of air time and many more weeks for the PhDs. There were setbacks involving too much snow, meals involving too much reindeer meat and delightful conversations of mutual incomprehension over little jars of vodka. What precisely is the Dutch, or Russian, for \"It may well prove difficult to transport this mammoth across the tundra, paleontological colleague of mine\"? Answers on a postcard, please. </p> <p>But when the first hairs of this long-dead beast emerged from the earth before the cameras, it was a very poignant moment. A Dutch mammoth specialist (or perhaps the Dutch mammoth specialist - surely this isn't a boom trade in the Netherlands) stroked the hair between his fingers like a barber and used a hairdryer to blow debris from these precious strands. He was sitting on the back of this mammoth, and for a moment, became a tender maharajah of the tundra. </p> <p>Since the start of the 19th century, 12 mammoths have been dug up, two of them by a nonagenarian paleontologist from St Petersburg, whose name is even more difficult to say than the phrase nonagenarian paleontologist. Most of those mammoths have been male. </p> <p>It's easy to understand why. Imagine that you are a 25-year-old boy mammoth, spending about 20 hours a day foraging. In a lake you see some plants and wade in, not thinking that you will stick in the mud or drown. Males often do stupid things, but most of us only rarely suffer the consequences. This stupid male, poor lump, did suffer for his hormone-fuelled stupidity and died where he was stuck. Female mammoths rarely got into such scrapes, but were instead killed principally by Neanderthal males. Which is sad and ironic, when you think about it.</p>",

It took a long time to dig this mammoth out of the ground. Two hours of air time and many more weeks for the PhDs. There were setbacks involving too much snow, meals involving too much reindeer meat and delightful conversations of mutual incomprehension over little jars of vodka. What precisely is the Dutch, or Russian, for \"It may well prove difficult to transport this mammoth across the tundra, paleontological colleague of mine\"? Answers on a postcard, please. But when the first hairs of this long-dead beast emerged from the earth before the cameras, it was a very poignant moment. A Dutch mammoth specialist (or perhaps the Dutch mammoth specialist - surely this isn't a boom trade in the Netherlands) stroked the hair between his fingers like a barber and used a hairdryer to blow debris from these precious strands. He was sitting on the back of this mammoth, and for a moment, became a tender maharajah of the tundra. Since the start of the 19th century, 12 mammoths have been dug up, two of them by a nonagenarian paleontologist from St Petersburg, whose name is even more difficult to say than the phrase nonagenarian paleontologist. Most of those mammoths have been male. It's easy to understand why. Imagine that you are a 25-year-old boy mammoth, spending about 20 hours a day foraging. In a lake you see some plants and wade in, not thinking that you will stick in the mud or drown. Males often do stupid things, but most of us only rarely suffer the consequences. This stupid male, poor lump, did suffer for his hormone-fuelled stupidity and died where he was stuck. Female mammoths rarely got into such scrapes, but were instead killed principally by Neanderthal males. Which is sad and ironic, when you think about it.",

      "body": "<p>The cream of the UK film industry will gather in Hollywood next Sunday for the annual pageant of pomp, glamour and backslapping that is the Oscars ceremony. And some are predicting it could be a vintage night for the Brits.</p> <p>Sam Mendes leads the field with eight Oscar nominations for the widely acclaimed American Beauty, while Janet McTeer is seen as being in with a good chance of scooping best actress for her role in the American comedy Tumbleweeds.</p> <p>Michael Caine and Jude Law are up for best supporting actor, Nottingham-born Samantha Morton is in the running for best supporting actress, while Mike Leigh and Anthony Minghella are among those vying for the best screenplay award for Topsy-Turvy and The Talented Mr Ripley respectively.</p> <p>Our healthy showing in the nominations reflects the fact that the British film industry is thriving. Recent figures showed that American and other overseas studios spent \u00a3404m on shooting film and TV productions in Britain last year, up sharply on the 1998 figure of \u00a3250m. In fact, four of the half-dozen or so biggest grossing films in the world in 1999 were made here, including Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace and Notting Hill. The number of films made that meet the definition \"British\" jumped from 102 in 1998 to 160 last year.</p> <p>Last month, former Channel 4 head Michael Grade declared that the British film industry was set for a huge expansion as government initiatives such as tax breaks for film-makers and millions in Lottery money takes effect. But not everything in the garden is rosy. Many Lottery-funded Brit flicks of the last year or two have underperformed at the box office; Britain lacks an effective film distribution infrastructure, and investment in movies can be, as the department for culture, media and sport puts it, \"very volatile\".</p> <p>However, such concerns have done nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of the thousands of people pouring out of film and media courses, hungry for a slice of movie action. It's a fiercely competitive sector. \"The UK media industry employs roughly 60,000 people and there's always another 60,000 people trying to get in,\" says Skillset, the national training organisation whose website (<a href=\"http://www.skillset.org\" target=\"NEW\">www.skillset.org</a>) features a wealth of useful information on the various courses and training schemes on offer around the country.</p> <p>But there are no hard and fast rules for getting into the industry, according to Skillset's online careers guide. \"There are people who have successfully completed relevant courses who are still unable to break into a real job. And there are others who by being enthusiastic and in the right place at the right time are given that all-important first job,\" it adds.</p> <p>As always, the advice is to get as much experience under your belt as possible. That's what Andrew Mitchell did, and his efforts paid off - a year ago he landed a job as a junior camera assistant with Bristol-based Aardman Animations, the company behind Wallace and Gromit.</p> <p>Originally from north London, Andrew, 24, studied English literature and creative writing at Bath Spa University College. As part of this, he did a film studies module, which involved students making their own short films. After graduating he applied to several film schools, was shortlisted for a cinematography course at one, but did not get in.</p> <p>\"They did say to reapply. I considered it. Then I decided I wanted more experience in the industry itself.\" He fired off letters to various production companies and did short stints including a spell on BBC1's Casualty and three weeks' work experience at Aardman. \"I broke into the camera department through that. They tried me out for a couple of weeks and thought I was getting along OK, and offered me a job after that.\"</p> <p>Andrew is currently working on Aardman's upcoming animated feature Chicken Run and says his advice to those keen to follow in his footsteps is to \"get as much experience as possible, even if you are not getting paid straightaway. You are making contacts and it looks very good on your CV.\"</p> <p>You would imagine that a company as well-known as Aardman would have no difficulty filling any of the posts it advertises, but it has had no end of problems recruiting animators with expertise in the field of 3D clay animation and has had to bring in people from overseas. \"There is a huge shortage at the moment,\" says Pam Hayes, head of human resources. It has also found there are a dearth of illustrators versed in the art of 2D storyboarding (preparing the storyboard for the animator). In an attempt to raise awareness it is putting together a roadshow which will tour careers events around the country, and is running its own training school for people who have just left college.</p> <p>Around 90% of those who work in film are freelancers, and don't have access to structured training and development. Yet with new technology revolutionising the way movies are made, it is more important than ever. So the film industry last year set up the Skills Investment Fund, which will help finance new training in areas where there are shortages.</p> <p>One recent development that has given hope to film students everywhere is the global box office success of the Blair Witch Project. Hoping to ride the renewed wave of interest in horror is Nigel Wingrove, head of London-based Salvation Films. He aims to build Salvation into \"the world's largest sex and horror company, far surpassing the past glories of Hammer Films\", and the first film is Sacred Flesh, a depiction of suppressed sexuality set in a convent. The \u00a3300,000 movie was shot in 10 days at locations including London's Tower Bridge.</p> <p>Filmed on digital video, Sacred Flesh has secured a two-week run at London's ABC Piccadilly and has been sold to most of Europe, the US and Japan - not bad for a first feature that received no state or Lottery funding.</p> <p>Mr Wingrove says that more than 60% of UK-made films never get a theatrical release or make back their budget, while Sacred Flesh is on target to go into profit. Making a film is only half the battle - you've then got to get it in front of a paying audience. \"I've seen it so many times - someone has made a film and haven't thought about how to market it and get their money back.\"</p> <p>Many colleges and universities offer film-related courses. One of the most highly-regarded is the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire (<a href=\"http://www.nftsfilm-tv.ac.uk\" target=\"NEW\">www.nftsfilm-tv.ac.uk</a>), which runs full-time diploma courses in 11 subjects including directing, screenwriting and cinematography.

      "bodyText": "The cream of the UK film industry will gather in Hollywood next Sunday for the annual pageant of pomp, glamour and backslapping that is the Oscars ceremony. And some are predicting it could be a vintage night for the Brits. Sam Mendes leads the field with eight Oscar nominations for the widely acclaimed American Beauty, while Janet McTeer is seen as being in with a good chance of scooping best actress for her role in the American comedy Tumbleweeds. Michael Caine and Jude Law are up for best supporting actor, Nottingham-born Samantha Morton is in the running for best supporting actress, while Mike Leigh and Anthony Minghella are among those vying for the best screenplay award for Topsy-Turvy and The Talented Mr Ripley respectively. Our healthy showing in the nominations reflects the fact that the British film industry is thriving. Recent figures showed that American and other overseas studios spent \u00a3404m on shooting film and TV productions in Britain last year, up sharply on the 1998 figure of \u00a3250m. In fact, four of the half-dozen or so biggest grossing films in the world in 1999 were made here, including Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace and Notting Hill. The number of films made that meet the definition \"British\" jumped from 102 in 1998 to 160 last year. Last month, former Channel 4 head Michael Grade declared that the British film industry was set for a huge expansion as government initiatives such as tax breaks for film-makers and millions in Lottery money takes effect. But not everything in the garden is rosy. Many Lottery-funded Brit flicks of the last year or two have underperformed at the box office; Britain lacks an effective film distribution infrastructure, and investment in movies can be, as the department for culture, media and sport puts it, \"very volatile\". However, such concerns have done nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of the thousands of people pouring out of film and media courses, hungry for a slice of movie action. It's a fiercely competitive sector. \"The UK media industry employs roughly 60,000 people and there's always another 60,000 people trying to get in,\" says Skillset, the national training organisation whose website (www.skillset.org) features a wealth of useful information on the various courses and training schemes on offer around the country. But there are no hard and fast rules for getting into the industry, according to Skillset's online careers guide. \"There are people who have successfully completed relevant courses who are still unable to break into a real job. And there are others who by being enthusiastic and in the right place at the right time are given that all-important first job,\" it adds. As always, the advice is to get as much experience under your belt as possible. That's what Andrew Mitchell did, and his efforts paid off - a year ago he landed a job as a junior camera assistant with Bristol-based Aardman Animations, the company behind Wallace and Gromit. Originally from north London, Andrew, 24, studied English literature and creative writing at Bath Spa University College. As part of this, he did a film studies module, which involved students making their own short films. After graduating he applied to several film schools, was shortlisted for a cinematography course at one, but did not get in. \"They did say to reapply. I considered it. Then I decided I wanted more experience in the industry itself.\" He fired off letters to various production companies and did short stints including a spell on BBC1's Casualty and three weeks' work experience at Aardman. \"I broke into the camera department through that. They tried me out for a couple of weeks and thought I was getting along OK, and offered me a job after that.\" Andrew is currently working on Aardman's upcoming animated feature Chicken Run and says his advice to those keen to follow in his footsteps is to \"get as much experience as possible, even if you are not getting paid straightaway. You are making contacts and it looks very good on your CV.\" You would imagine that a company as well-known as Aardman would have no difficulty filling any of the posts it advertises, but it has had no end of problems recruiting animators with expertise in the field of 3D clay animation and has had to bring in people from overseas. \"There is a huge shortage at the moment,\" says Pam Hayes, head of human resources. It has also found there are a dearth of illustrators versed in the art of 2D storyboarding (preparing the storyboard for the animator). In an attempt to raise awareness it is putting together a roadshow which will tour careers events around the country, and is running its own training school for people who have just left college. Around 90% of those who work in film are freelancers, and don't have access to structured training and development. Yet with new technology revolutionising the way movies are made, it is more important than ever. So the film industry last year set up the Skills Investment Fund, which will help finance new training in areas where there are shortages. One recent development that has given hope to film students everywhere is the global box office success of the Blair Witch Project. Hoping to ride the renewed wave of interest in horror is Nigel Wingrove, head of London-based Salvation Films. He aims to build Salvation into \"the world's largest sex and horror company, far surpassing the past glories of Hammer Films\", and the first film is Sacred Flesh, a depiction of suppressed sexuality set in a convent. The \u00a3300,000 movie was shot in 10 days at locations including London's Tower Bridge. Filmed on digital video, Sacred Flesh has secured a two-week run at London's ABC Piccadilly and has been sold to most of Europe, the US and Japan - not bad for a first feature that received no state or Lottery funding. Mr Wingrove says that more than 60% of UK-made films never get a theatrical release or make back their budget, while Sacred Flesh is on target to go into profit. Making a film is only half the battle - you've then got to get it in front of a paying audience. \"I've seen it so many times - someone has made a film and haven't thought about how to market it and get their money back.\" Many colleges and universities offer film-related courses. One of the most highly-regarded is the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire (www.nftsfilm-tv.ac.uk), which runs full-time diploma courses in 11 subjects including directing, screenwriting and cinematography. It helps for applicants to have a degree under their belts and/or some experience.There are about 140 students at the school, and the rate of employment in the first six months after graduation is high - about 75%. Where do I start? Skillset, the national training organisation for the film industry, publishes \"Careers Pack: A Career in Broadcast, Film and Video,\" which is crammed with information and advice on jobs, training and education. The entire nine-chapter guide is available to read for free on Skillset's website (www.skillset.org). A new updated version is currently being prepared and will be in bookshops this autumn. Skillset's website also features an online guide aimed at students aged 14-17 who are thinking about a career in television. The British Film Institute (www.bfi.org.uk) publishes an online database of hundreds of short courses in film, TV, video and radio taking place around the country - everything from an introduction to lighting to digital video editing. Two useful BFI publications include Media Courses UK 2000 (\u00a312.99, edited by Lavinia Orton), which carries details of courses offered by UK colleges and universities.",

      "body": "<p>It was after we had been talking for about half an hour that I began to wonder if Kathleen Turner could be making everything up. It is partly the way that she says things, with the intensity of having just thought of them. But, more than this, her story is so self-consciously theatrical, so laden down with clich\u00e9s, that it can't easily be believed. There is a bit too much of everything and, to paraphrase Wilde, whereas one clich\u00e9 may be accounted bad luck, a whole accumulation begins to look like design. </p> <p>Then again, anyone who knows Ms Turner's work - from her debut film Body Heat in 1981 through to Serial Mom in 1994 - might say that this runs close to a definition. She is pretty over-the-top. A creature of impulse, a creator of impulse. </p> <p>There's a great line that Ken Russell gives her in his 1984 film, Crimes Of Passion, in which she plays parallel stereotypes, a frigid career woman by day and a hot-as-hell hooker by night: \"B-movies have always been my inspiration,\" declares the hooker, China Blue. Clich\u00e9s, stereotypes, stock fantasies, of course, are what we reach for when we don't know which way the plot is going and have to resort to something that we know has worked before.</p> <p>Clich\u00e9s are a loss of bottle. This is partly what the film is about. The quick fix. The lengths to which we will all go to find the illusion of safety. It's a quintessential Russell film: a black comedy, complete with nuns and masturbation, and Anthony Perkins doing a reprise of Norman Bates, now a deranged preacher at large on the streets of LA. It is also Turner's favourite of all her films. I spent a lot of time wondering why. Why not, say, Body Heat, her spectacular debut that set up her femme fatale image, the idea of woman as enchantress, purveyor of sex as death, the image she has so brilliantly parodied throughout the rest of her career? Or, for that matter, The War Of The Roses, probably her best part? </p> <p>Crimes Of Passion pushed her, she says, \"to my limit\". After completion, she was so exhausted that she slept for 22 hours. It is a clever film, a kind of maze, that leads you in all sorts of wrong directions, teases you, before finally succumbing - no, wrong word - celebrating what some may think is the biggest clich\u00e9 in the book, love.</p> <p>Not Kathleen Turner, however. The film, you might say, is a kind of thumbnail sketch of Ms Turner's life. Because it turns out that, in real life, the most provocative woman on celluloid, this fascinatingly mysterious nocturnal diabolique, has been happily married to the same man, Jay, for 18 years. Their daughter, Rachel, is 12. And, at the risk of making her sound dull or unadventurous, which she certainly isn't, I can report that she also tells me, \"Sexual fidelity is very important to me and to my husband.\" And: \"Sexuality has never been the core of my personality.\" </p> <p>First, the clich\u00e9s and melodramas. They begin with her birth in - where else? - midwest Missouri, home of American corn. Third child of four, the beauty in the family. Four years later, now living in Cuba, where her father is a diplomat, she is evacuated on the eve of the revolution. On one of the last American planes to leave Havana. \"They came for us in the middle of the night, just the women and children. We waited for the men in Florida. My father closed the American embassy.\"</p> <p>Next stop, Caracas, where her father was consul, and she was the only blonde on the block. Cuba she had loathed, and still does in her memory, but Caracas she loved, and the deep-throat huskiness of her voice can be read as a kind of tribute to the Spanish language that she spoke there as a kid. </p> <p>No sooner is she back in Washington, aged nine, than Kennedy is killed. \"The President has been shot,\" she recalls someone saying. And, always the school smart-ass, she recounts her reply: \"Don't be silly, that was Abraham Lincoln.\" As a teenager in London in the late 60s, she decides she wants to go on the stage, and when her father tells her to stop her ridiculous fantasies, she's going to university like her brothers and sister, there is a huge row of the \"It's my life\" variety.</p> <p>The irrepressible adolescent, just 17, \"runs away from home\" and fetches up in... Stratford-on-Avon. She is following her passion, the theatre. In Stratford she sees, no doubt, the production of its day, David Warner's Hamlet, casting herself, surely, not as the blighted Ophelia but as the prince, \u00e0 la Sarah Bernhardt. Drama queen. Turner arrives back in London after a weekend away, without a penny, and telephones home, reversing the charges. She expects one of her parents to come and pick her up, imagining they'd be so relieved to have her home safely that they'd forget to be too cross. </p> <p>Have you noticed how, when someone is relating something bad that has happened to them, they always have to start at the beginning and follow through to the end. No short cuts, no editing. The story slows right down; it's all or nothing. As if this is the only way that something truly terrible can be grasped. </p> <p>\"I remember my mother's voice at the end of the phone, saying, 'Get a taxi home, darling', and thinking this was odd because we never did that. And when I got there the house was filled with people I didn't know. My father had died one hour before in the backyard, from a coronary thrombosis. He had been interned by the Japanese in Shanghai for four years during the war. His health never recovered. It was a very bad time.\" With no diplomatic status to remain in Britain, the family was uprooted, lost their home, and returned to smalltown Springfield, Missouri, where the grandparents lived. \"I think it has since changed, but in those days a foreign service widow only got half her husband's pension. So we were broke.\" Missouri was pretty odd. \"I'd never lived in anywhere like the midwest. Er, so that was a first.\" </p> <p>She loved her father, she says, \"very, very much. A very strong man, a good man.\" Maybe she is like him? \"Yes,\" she says, \"I think maybe I am.\" She must miss him. \"Not really. He has been dead a long time, longer than I knew him.\" </p> <p>No theatricality here, only restraint. Which is what happens, I guess, when melodrama turns to reality, comedy to tragedy. In her career, of course, she has done both. But it is parody, irony, that is her true form. Maybe this comes from the diplomatic background. If artifice with an ulterior motive could be one definition of parody, it could stand equally well for diplomacy. </p> <p>She is hugely likeable. And immensely formidable. \"I am Kathleen Turner and you are late\" are her first words when we meet. Which is frightening and funny - just like her. And she is right. I am precisely a minute-and-a-half late, according to her watch. It's not worth making an excuse. In her book, late is late. Which is another thing about her. There's a surface baroque extravagance, but it's always undercut with a kind of purism. If she were a city, she would be not Rome, where she longs to live, but Barcelona - think Gaud\u00ed's Sagrada Familia, all vulgarity and vertigo. </p> <p>She is no pushover, clearly, and is not easily flattered - a truly uncommon trait in a film star. When people greet her in the street with, \"You are Kathleen Turner. I love you\", she corrects them roundly. \"I hope you mean you like my work, you don't know me.\" She doesn't let anyone get away with anything. So, when I say that I imagine that she likes the idea of herself as a bold denter of taboos, she replies, \"Not really. Not in my life.\" She smokes, cigarillos. Swears, not like a trooper, but enough - \"I love the theatre because, unlike film, they can't fuck with you.\" Of course, absolutely no one in Hollywood smokes or swears, which may account for why she lives in New York. But this hardly makes for a revolution. </p> <p>She has a reputation, too, for being difficult. \"In my work.\" All that means, she says, \"is that I know what I want. In a man it would be deemed admirable.\" She gives me this example: \"Say a director asks me to do another take because he wants to pan the room, and I say, 'You don't need me for a shot of the room. Get a dummy.' In my work, I am very sure, and if I run up against someone who is less sure they can be defensive. And, unfortunately, I am not the most tactful person.\" Difficult, in other words. </p> <p>She has this way, as she speaks, of leaning seductively forward, her upper torso tilted gently towards you, while raising one eyebrow into the shape of an immaculate isosceles triangle. It's hard to do and very alarming. She used it to great effect in John Water's Serial Mom, the eyebrow going up and down like a bouncing ball as she gets madder and madder, until by the end it's almost permanently raised. It's the one thing that she really likes about film, she says. \"With the camera and a 70ft wide screen, even a blink is a sentence. That kind of precision I find interesting.\" </p> <p>She thinks she'll miss it when she goes on stage in the West End later this month as Mrs Robinson in Terry Johnson's new adaptation of The Graduate. But I doubt that she'll need it. With that dome of heat that hangs over her, she will smoulder as Mrs Robinson. And, assuming Johnson doesn't turn it into some heavy-handed social satire, she definitely has the whiplash sense of humour that Anne Bancroft so conspicuously lacked in the film. Bancroft is married to Mel Brooks, I say. \"That's too bad,\" says Turner, fast as lightning and not looking remotely sad. \"Still, maybe he knows how to make her laugh.\" </p> <p>Turner is her mother's daughter, no question. She tells a story about her during their time in Cuba: apparently, towards the end, as the revolution loomed, all the telephones carried one of those eternal recordings; so, with every call, prior to connection, would be heard, \"Castro is your saviour. Castro is your future.\" \"My earliest memory is of my mum shouting down the phone: 'Castro is an asshole, Castro is a fucker.' \" After their father died it was her mother who kept the family together, made sure he got his wish that all of the children went to college. She was scrupulously loyal to him. She's now 76. \"She never married again. Never met anyone, I guess.\" The two of them are close. \"She's coming over to stay with me in May.\" </p> <p>It wasn't always the way. Her mother was furious when her daughter, aged 20, insisted on moving from Missouri, where she was in a theatre group with John Goodman, to Baltimore to join another group there. There was another big fight. \"I am not your daughter any more. I am a woman, and unless you can treat me as one we cannot go on.\" Turner packed her bags, got in her car and drove off. About 60 miles out of town, she turned around and drove back. She'd learned, not so long before with her father, that you don't part in anger from people you love. A year later, her mother wrote a letter: \"She said that she hoped one day I would understand how frightening it is for a parent not to understand their child's wants. That a parent always tries to keep a child on familiar territory, to keep the child safe. It was a lovely letter from a good woman.\" </p> <p>Once she had made up her mind that she was definitely going to go for it, success came fast. \"There wasn't anything else I wanted to do with my life except act, and there didn't seem any reason not to do it.\" After Baltimore, she moved east again, to New York, where she slept on a friend's floor, went to auditions during the day and was a hotel receptionist or sometime waitress in the evenings. After five months, she was in a play Off Off Broadway. After nine months, she had a part in a television sitcom. After 11 months, there was a Broadway play. When, in 1980, she heard that a new young director, Lawrence Kasdan, was in town auditioning for a film called Body Heat, she applied, only to be told by the casting director that Mr Kasdan was not about to waste his time seeing someone with no film experience. </p> <p>It was three months later, now in Los Angeles for something else, that another casting director asked her to read for the part of Matty Walker. The next day she was screen-tested with William Hurt, who was to play what can now be said to be his best role as the self-satisfied lawyer, Ned Racine, whom Matty hires to kill her husband. When executive producer George Lucas saw the screen test, he said simply that he didn't want to look at anyone else. \"It was Lucas who said I had to have it. So that was it.\" </p> <p>It was great, she says. \"Being treated like a goddess, it felt right. I'd never had that much attention in my life.\" The third child, of course. And then filming ended, the attention stopped, and she had to go back to waitressing in New York. \"It's a funny thing that. It was nearly a year later that the film came out. And then I was a star again.\" But maybe in this interim she learned something about the fickle nature of fame. Or maybe it was just her natural perversity. Because, when all the offers started coming in from Hollywood, \"for essentially rip-offs of Body Heat - so boring, so stupid\", she just said no.</p> <p>Then Carl Reiner rang and asked, \"Do you have a sense of humour?\" Which is how, in only her second film role, in The Man With Two Brains, opposite Steve Martin, and featuring also David Warner, her erstwhile Hamlet, she came to be playing a send-up of the part that made her famous - a femme fatale who kills men for money, and ends up weighing a few hundred pounds. </p> <p>What makes her so compelling to watch is that you can sense she is not frightened - it's what makes her such a convincing, swashbuckling adventurer, more than the equal of Michael Douglas in Jewel Of The Nile and Romancing The Stone. People such as this can make you frightened for them, viz her mother and father, though probably even they underestimated her. Like Bette Davis before her, there's a strong strain of sado-masochism in her work. Imagine Turner in a remake of Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? But, as she says, Hollywood today would never dare as much. \"It seems to me that our national taste is determined by adolescents. Our culture is based entirely now on teenagers.\" </p> <p>Sure, not everyone is a fan and not every role is a gem, but she makes her mark. It's interesting, looking back, how she never looked young. There has never been anything of the ing\u00e9nue about her. She was always too old for Hollywood. She carried this weight of experience around, all the frenetic activity of her past, and channelled it into her work with an almost clownish or burlesque quality. She never expected much of the business, she says: \"I knew that after 40 I would be less valued. Experience is not something American film values.\" </p> <p>She says that she never expected much of her personal life, either. But here she was surprised. \"I was ambitious to succeed. I didn't think I'd get married. I know men aren't well trained at having a wife who gets more attention than them. So it never seemed likely that I'd have a stable marriage and home.\" She wasn't going to settle for less. She was 29 when she met Jay, a property developer. \"Up to that point, his idea of family life was picking up the kids every other weekend.\" After four months, they were \"engaged\". After eight months, they married. That was in 1983 - either the same year she filmed Crimes Of Passion or soon after. It has been great, she says. \"Though, God knows, it hasn't been smooth.\" </p> <p>Between Prizzi's Honor in 1985, in which she was a contract killer opposite Jack Nicholson and seemed to have little lust left for anything except killing, and Serial Mom in 1994 - almost a decade, during which time she became a mother - only The War Of The Roses, a satire on marital mores opposite Michael Douglas, stands out. The actress who was upward-bound suddenly dropped from sight. Somehow, the lustre left her. She didn't seem to have the enthusiasm for making movies any more. Serial Mom was different, a return to parodic form: all that blatant, man-eater eye-rolling as she devours her victims. She's a fleshy vamp, the men are puny wimps. It's her circus, a solo performance, and a lot to carry. </p> <p>It was during Serial Mom that she noticed her feet were swelling. She couldn't get into her shoes. She didn't mention this to anyone. Then her neck locked, and she couldn't turn her head. The joints in her hands swelled so much that it got to the point where she couldn't pick up a glass, the pain was too great. Several medical diagnoses later, she was informed that she had the incurable disease, rheumatoid arthritis - a swelling of the lining of the joints.</p> <p>Most people, she explains, have a rheumatoid factor of between 40 and 60. \"Mine was 1,600.\" Immuno suppressants (ie, steroids) and anti-inflammatory drugs were the only treatment available. On the steroids, she blew up like a balloon. Because of the pain, she was a virtual cripple. Rheumatoid arthritis is what is known as an auto-immune disease, an illness where the body's immune system reacts inappropriately and actually creates the problem in seeking to cure it. The ultimate ironic illness, you might say. </p> <p>Of course, the illness fits perfectly the B-movie theory of her life. Beautiful actress succumbs to incurable progressive illness. Except she didn't succumb. So what about: beautiful actress struck down by incurable illness triumphs over adversity? Enough clich\u00e9s. She didn't have a plot, she didn't have anything to hang on to. She didn't triumph. She just carried on day-to-day as best she could against worn-out medical advice that there was nothing to reverse the illness.</p> <p>Then the rumours started. \"That I was a drunk, that's why I had put on all the weight.\" There were photos of her in the papers. Unrecognisable. \"Hollywood's a strange business. It's happy to hire people who are drunk on set or arrested for drug use, over and over again, but being ill is quite another thing. So my policy was to keep quiet and let them think what they wanted. I decided not to tell anyone in the business that I was ill. Still, I think that I was right about that.\" In 1997, at the height of the illness, she was giving interviews in which she spoke of it in the past tense. And there was a further imperative: her husband's business was going through a hard time. \"I needed to work.\" </p> <p>She kept going, she says, through eight years of chronic pain. Angry, though never sure if it was the illness or the drugs that made her lash out. Crying. \"Oh yeah. But trying not to cry in front of Jay and Rachel.\" They were wonderful, she says. Rachel was four when Turner was diagnosed. She was too weak to walk, too weak to pick up her daughter. Far too weak to pretend. Then, 18 months ago, a new drug was administered that reversed most of the effects of the illness. \"I remember being met by Rachel and Jay at the airport. When I saw them, I just started to run. Then I heard Rachel saying, 'Mummy, you ran.' She was so aware and so happy for me.\"</p> <p>When your children see you more helpless than they are themselves, she says, it changes something in the balance of your relationship. And for the better. \"You are no longer the all-powerful parent. You have to cede that position, and it brings you closer. Through pain you learn a lot. It's unfortunate, but it's true. I wish you could learn as much from being happy, but it doesn't seem to work that way.\" </p> <p>Maybe not. But it's not only through suffering that you learn. It seems she learned a great deal from her parents and from her wise mother in particular. That looks are only a part of a persona, not the core of the self. \"Beauty wasn't made much of in my family. I had an older sister who wasn't as pretty as me and I was always told: 'Don't pat yourself on the back for something you didn't earn.'\" This stood her in good stead when she began to lose her looks through the illness.</p> <p>\"Of course you feel sexually threatened. You lose confidence. I became a little timid, yes. But my whole sense of self worth wasn't bound up with my looks fortunately. So it didn't feel like losing myself so much as a part of myself.\" When she looks back, she says, \"It seems I was this almost blithe, wilfully naive person to dare to take so much for granted - health, beauty.\" But now, she says, she is once again turning heads on the street and it's wonderful. \"Once, it was a burden to me. Now, it's the icing on the cake. </p> <p>In The Graduate, as Mrs Robinson, she will be dramatising once again an inversion of family value - the mother jealous of her daughter who tries then to subvert her romantic happiness. The sexually predatory, cunning older woman. She'll need all the humour and the irony that she can muster if this is not to look like some kind of dinosaur of sexual politics. Johnson's script, she says, is far cleverer than the cutesy film script. \"In the film, Katharine Ross had nothing to say; she just had to look good, be an icon of prettiness.\" Whereas in the play, Elaine Robinson \"will be a real person.\" </p> <p>Real and unreal. \"It is the bane of every actor's life,\" she says. \"The confusion between the person and the role.\" You don't know me, is what she says to the people who greet her in the street. \"You know my work.\" But this can't be entirely right. For the actor, as for any artist, if the work is going to have any meaning at all it must demonstrate in some way what the actor has learned in life up to that point. Otherwise, it's no more than a cartoon. There are bound to be correlations. Turner is an honest actor who is also an honest woman </p> <p>\u0095 The Graduate opens at the Gielgud Theatre, London, on April 5. Previews from March 24.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was after we had been talking for about half an hour that I began to wonder if Kathleen Turner could be making everything up. It is partly the way that she says things, with the intensity of having just thought of them. But, more than this, her story is so self-consciously theatrical, so laden down with clich\u00e9s, that it can't easily be believed. There is a bit too much of everything and, to paraphrase Wilde, whereas one clich\u00e9 may be accounted bad luck, a whole accumulation begins to look like design. Then again, anyone who knows Ms Turner's work - from her debut film Body Heat in 1981 through to Serial Mom in 1994 - might say that this runs close to a definition. She is pretty over-the-top. A creature of impulse, a creator of impulse. There's a great line that Ken Russell gives her in his 1984 film, Crimes Of Passion, in which she plays parallel stereotypes, a frigid career woman by day and a hot-as-hell hooker by night: \"B-movies have always been my inspiration,\" declares the hooker, China Blue. Clich\u00e9s, stereotypes, stock fantasies, of course, are what we reach for when we don't know which way the plot is going and have to resort to something that we know has worked before. Clich\u00e9s are a loss of bottle. This is partly what the film is about. The quick fix. The lengths to which we will all go to find the illusion of safety. It's a quintessential Russell film: a black comedy, complete with nuns and masturbation, and Anthony Perkins doing a reprise of Norman Bates, now a deranged preacher at large on the streets of LA. It is also Turner's favourite of all her films. I spent a lot of time wondering why. Why not, say, Body Heat, her spectacular debut that set up her femme fatale image, the idea of woman as enchantress, purveyor of sex as death, the image she has so brilliantly parodied throughout the rest of her career? Or, for that matter, The War Of The Roses, probably her best part? Crimes Of Passion pushed her, she says, \"to my limit\". After completion, she was so exhausted that she slept for 22 hours. It is a clever film, a kind of maze, that leads you in all sorts of wrong directions, teases you, before finally succumbing - no, wrong word - celebrating what some may think is the biggest clich\u00e9 in the book, love. Not Kathleen Turner, however. The film, you might say, is a kind of thumbnail sketch of Ms Turner's life. Because it turns out that, in real life, the most provocative woman on celluloid, this fascinatingly mysterious nocturnal diabolique, has been happily married to the same man, Jay, for 18 years. Their daughter, Rachel, is 12. And, at the risk of making her sound dull or unadventurous, which she certainly isn't, I can report that she also tells me, \"Sexual fidelity is very important to me and to my husband.\" And: \"Sexuality has never been the core of my personality.\" First, the clich\u00e9s and melodramas. They begin with her birth in - where else? - midwest Missouri, home of American corn. Third child of four, the beauty in the family. Four years later, now living in Cuba, where her father is a diplomat, she is evacuated on the eve of the revolution. On one of the last American planes to leave Havana. \"They came for us in the middle of the night, just the women and children. We waited for the men in Florida. My father closed the American embassy.\" Next stop, Caracas, where her father was consul, and she was the only blonde on the block. Cuba she had loathed, and still does in her memory, but Caracas she loved, and the deep-throat huskiness of her voice can be read as a kind of tribute to the Spanish language that she spoke there as a kid. No sooner is she back in Washington, aged nine, than Kennedy is killed. \"The President has been shot,\" she recalls someone saying. And, always the school smart-ass, she recounts her reply: \"Don't be silly, that was Abraham Lincoln.\" As a teenager in London in the late 60s, she decides she wants to go on the stage, and when her father tells her to stop her ridiculous fantasies, she's going to university like her brothers and sister, there is a huge row of the \"It's my life\" variety. The irrepressible adolescent, just 17, \"runs away from home\" and fetches up in... Stratford-on-Avon. She is following her passion, the theatre. In Stratford she sees, no doubt, the production of its day, David Warner's Hamlet, casting herself, surely, not as the blighted Ophelia but as the prince, \u00e0 la Sarah Bernhardt. Drama queen. Turner arrives back in London after a weekend away, without a penny, and telephones home, reversing the charges. She expects one of her parents to come and pick her up, imagining they'd be so relieved to have her home safely that they'd forget to be too cross. Have you noticed how, when someone is relating something bad that has happened to them, they always have to start at the beginning and follow through to the end. No short cuts, no editing. The story slows right down; it's all or nothing. As if this is the only way that something truly terrible can be grasped. \"I remember my mother's voice at the end of the phone, saying, 'Get a taxi home, darling', and thinking this was odd because we never did that. And when I got there the house was filled with people I didn't know. My father had died one hour before in the backyard, from a coronary thrombosis. He had been interned by the Japanese in Shanghai for four years during the war. His health never recovered. It was a very bad time.\" With no diplomatic status to remain in Britain, the family was uprooted, lost their home, and returned to smalltown Springfield, Missouri, where the grandparents lived. \"I think it has since changed, but in those days a foreign service widow only got half her husband's pension. So we were broke.\" Missouri was pretty odd. \"I'd never lived in anywhere like the midwest. Er, so that was a first.\" She loved her father, she says, \"very, very much. A very strong man, a good man.\" Maybe she is like him? \"Yes,\" she says, \"I think maybe I am.\" She must miss him. \"Not really. He has been dead a long time, longer than I knew him.\" No theatricality here, only restraint. Which is what happens, I guess, when melodrama turns to reality, comedy to tragedy. In her career, of course, she has done both. But it is parody, irony, that is her true form. Maybe this comes from the diplomatic background. If artifice with an ulterior motive could be one definition of parody, it could stand equally well for diplomacy. She is hugely likeable. And immensely formidable. \"I am Kathleen Turner and you are late\" are her first words when we meet. Which is frightening and funny - just like her. And she is right. I am precisely a minute-and-a-half late, according to her watch. It's not worth making an excuse. In her book, late is late. Which is another thing about her. There's a surface baroque extravagance, but it's always undercut with a kind of purism. If she were a city, she would be not Rome, where she longs to live, but Barcelona - think Gaud\u00ed's Sagrada Familia, all vulgarity and vertigo. She is no pushover, clearly, and is not easily flattered - a truly uncommon trait in a film star. When people greet her in the street with, \"You are Kathleen Turner. I love you\", she corrects them roundly. \"I hope you mean you like my work, you don't know me.\" She doesn't let anyone get away with anything. So, when I say that I imagine that she likes the idea of herself as a bold denter of taboos, she replies, \"Not really. Not in my life.\" She smokes, cigarillos. Swears, not like a trooper, but enough - \"I love the theatre because, unlike film, they can't fuck with you.\" Of course, absolutely no one in Hollywood smokes or swears, which may account for why she lives in New York. But this hardly makes for a revolution. She has a reputation, too, for being difficult. \"In my work.\" All that means, she says, \"is that I know what I want. In a man it would be deemed admirable.\" She gives me this example: \"Say a director asks me to do another take because he wants to pan the room, and I say, 'You don't need me for a shot of the room. Get a dummy.' In my work, I am very sure, and if I run up against someone who is less sure they can be defensive. And, unfortunately, I am not the most tactful person.\" Difficult, in other words. She has this way, as she speaks, of leaning seductively forward, her upper torso tilted gently towards you, while raising one eyebrow into the shape of an immaculate isosceles triangle. It's hard to do and very alarming. She used it to great effect in John Water's Serial Mom, the eyebrow going up and down like a bouncing ball as she gets madder and madder, until by the end it's almost permanently raised. It's the one thing that she really likes about film, she says. \"With the camera and a 70ft wide screen, even a blink is a sentence. That kind of precision I find interesting.\" She thinks she'll miss it when she goes on stage in the West End later this month as Mrs Robinson in Terry Johnson's new adaptation of The Graduate. But I doubt that she'll need it. With that dome of heat that hangs over her, she will smoulder as Mrs Robinson. And, assuming Johnson doesn't turn it into some heavy-handed social satire, she definitely has the whiplash sense of humour that Anne Bancroft so conspicuously lacked in the film. Bancroft is married to Mel Brooks, I say. \"That's too bad,\" says Turner, fast as lightning and not looking remotely sad. \"Still, maybe he knows how to make her laugh.\" Turner is her mother's daughter, no question. She tells a story about her during their time in Cuba: apparently, towards the end, as the revolution loomed, all the telephones carried one of those eternal recordings; so, with every call, prior to connection, would be heard, \"Castro is your saviour. Castro is your future.\" \"My earliest memory is of my mum shouting down the phone: 'Castro is an asshole, Castro is a fucker.' \" After their father died it was her mother who kept the family together, made sure he got his wish that all of the children went to college. She was scrupulously loyal to him. She's now 76. \"She never married again. Never met anyone, I guess.\" The two of them are close. \"She's coming over to stay with me in May.\" It wasn't always the way. Her mother was furious when her daughter, aged 20, insisted on moving from Missouri, where she was in a theatre group with John Goodman, to Baltimore to join another group there. There was another big fight. \"I am not your daughter any more. I am a woman, and unless you can treat me as one we cannot go on.\" Turner packed her bags, got in her car and drove off. About 60 miles out of town, she turned around and drove back. She'd learned, not so long before with her father, that you don't part in anger from people you love. A year later, her mother wrote a letter: \"She said that she hoped one day I would understand how frightening it is for a parent not to understand their child's wants. That a parent always tries to keep a child on familiar territory, to keep the child safe. It was a lovely letter from a good woman.\" Once she had made up her mind that she was definitely going to go for it, success came fast. \"There wasn't anything else I wanted to do with my life except act, and there didn't seem any reason not to do it.\" After Baltimore, she moved east again, to New York, where she slept on a friend's floor, went to auditions during the day and was a hotel receptionist or sometime waitress in the evenings. After five months, she was in a play Off Off Broadway. After nine months, she had a part in a television sitcom. After 11 months, there was a Broadway play. When, in 1980, she heard that a new young director, Lawrence Kasdan, was in town auditioning for a film called Body Heat, she applied, only to be told by the casting director that Mr Kasdan was not about to waste his time seeing someone with no film experience. It was three months later, now in Los Angeles for something else, that another casting director asked her to read for the part of Matty Walker. The next day she was screen-tested with William Hurt, who was to play what can now be said to be his best role as the self-satisfied lawyer, Ned Racine, whom Matty hires to kill her husband. When executive producer George Lucas saw the screen test, he said simply that he didn't want to look at anyone else. \"It was Lucas who said I had to have it. So that was it.\" It was great, she says. \"Being treated like a goddess, it felt right. I'd never had that much attention in my life.\" The third child, of course. And then filming ended, the attention stopped, and she had to go back to waitressing in New York. \"It's a funny thing that. It was nearly a year later that the film came out. And then I was a star again.\" But maybe in this interim she learned something about the fickle nature of fame. Or maybe it was just her natural perversity. Because, when all the offers started coming in from Hollywood, \"for essentially rip-offs of Body Heat - so boring, so stupid\", she just said no. Then Carl Reiner rang and asked, \"Do you have a sense of humour?\" Which is how, in only her second film role, in The Man With Two Brains, opposite Steve Martin, and featuring also David Warner, her erstwhile Hamlet, she came to be playing a send-up of the part that made her famous - a femme fatale who kills men for money, and ends up weighing a few hundred pounds. What makes her so compelling to watch is that you can sense she is not frightened - it's what makes her such a convincing, swashbuckling adventurer, more than the equal of Michael Douglas in Jewel Of The Nile and Romancing The Stone. People such as this can make you frightened for them, viz her mother and father, though probably even they underestimated her. Like Bette Davis before her, there's a strong strain of sado-masochism in her work. Imagine Turner in a remake of Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? But, as she says, Hollywood today would never dare as much. \"It seems to me that our national taste is determined by adolescents. Our culture is based entirely now on teenagers.\" Sure, not everyone is a fan and not every role is a gem, but she makes her mark. It's interesting, looking back, how she never looked young. There has never been anything of the ing\u00e9nue about her. She was always too old for Hollywood. She carried this weight of experience around, all the frenetic activity of her past, and channelled it into her work with an almost clownish or burlesque quality. She never expected much of the business, she says: \"I knew that after 40 I would be less valued. Experience is not something American film values.\" She says that she never expected much of her personal life, either. But here she was surprised. \"I was ambitious to succeed. I didn't think I'd get married. I know men aren't well trained at having a wife who gets more attention than them. So it never seemed likely that I'd have a stable marriage and home.\" She wasn't going to settle for less. She was 29 when she met Jay, a property developer. \"Up to that point, his idea of family life was picking up the kids every other weekend.\" After four months, they were \"engaged\". After eight months, they married. That was in 1983 - either the same year she filmed Crimes Of Passion or soon after. It has been great, she says. \"Though, God knows, it hasn't been smooth.\" Between Prizzi's Honor in 1985, in which she was a contract killer opposite Jack Nicholson and seemed to have little lust left for anything except killing, and Serial Mom in 1994 - almost a decade, during which time she became a mother - only The War Of The Roses, a satire on marital mores opposite Michael Douglas, stands out. The actress who was upward-bound suddenly dropped from sight. Somehow, the lustre left her. She didn't seem to have the enthusiasm for making movies any more. Serial Mom was different, a return to parodic form: all that blatant, man-eater eye-rolling as she devours her victims. She's a fleshy vamp, the men are puny wimps. It's her circus, a solo performance, and a lot to carry. It was during Serial Mom that she noticed her feet were swelling. She couldn't get into her shoes. She didn't mention this to anyone. Then her neck locked, and she couldn't turn her head. The joints in her hands swelled so much that it got to the point where she couldn't pick up a glass, the pain was too great. Several medical diagnoses later, she was informed that she had the incurable disease, rheumatoid arthritis - a swelling of the lining of the joints. Most people, she explains, have a rheumatoid factor of between 40 and 60. \"Mine was 1,600.\" Immuno suppressants (ie, steroids) and anti-inflammatory drugs were the only treatment available. On the steroids, she blew up like a balloon. Because of the pain, she was a virtual cripple. Rheumatoid arthritis is what is known as an auto-immune disease, an illness where the body's immune system reacts inappropriately and actually creates the problem in seeking to cure it. The ultimate ironic illness, you might say. Of course, the illness fits perfectly the B-movie theory of her life. Beautiful actress succumbs to incurable progressive illness. Except she didn't succumb. So what about: beautiful actress struck down by incurable illness triumphs over adversity? Enough clich\u00e9s. She didn't have a plot, she didn't have anything to hang on to. She didn't triumph. She just carried on day-to-day as best she could against worn-out medical advice that there was nothing to reverse the illness. Then the rumours started. \"That I was a drunk, that's why I had put on all the weight.\" There were photos of her in the papers. Unrecognisable. \"Hollywood's a strange business. It's happy to hire people who are drunk on set or arrested for drug use, over and over again, but being ill is quite another thing. So my policy was to keep quiet and let them think what they wanted. I decided not to tell anyone in the business that I was ill. Still, I think that I was right about that.\" In 1997, at the height of the illness, she was giving interviews in which she spoke of it in the past tense. And there was a further imperative: her husband's business was going through a hard time. \"I needed to work.\" She kept going, she says, through eight years of chronic pain. Angry, though never sure if it was the illness or the drugs that made her lash out. Crying. \"Oh yeah. But trying not to cry in front of Jay and Rachel.\" They were wonderful, she says. Rachel was four when Turner was diagnosed. She was too weak to walk, too weak to pick up her daughter. Far too weak to pretend. Then, 18 months ago, a new drug was administered that reversed most of the effects of the illness. \"I remember being met by Rachel and Jay at the airport. When I saw them, I just started to run. Then I heard Rachel saying, 'Mummy, you ran.' She was so aware and so happy for me.\" When your children see you more helpless than they are themselves, she says, it changes something in the balance of your relationship. And for the better. \"You are no longer the all-powerful parent. You have to cede that position, and it brings you closer. Through pain you learn a lot. It's unfortunate, but it's true. I wish you could learn as much from being happy, but it doesn't seem to work that way.\" Maybe not. But it's not only through suffering that you learn. It seems she learned a great deal from her parents and from her wise mother in particular. That looks are only a part of a persona, not the core of the self. \"Beauty wasn't made much of in my family. I had an older sister who wasn't as pretty as me and I was always told: 'Don't pat yourself on the back for something you didn't earn.'\" This stood her in good stead when she began to lose her looks through the illness. \"Of course you feel sexually threatened. You lose confidence. I became a little timid, yes. But my whole sense of self worth wasn't bound up with my looks fortunately. So it didn't feel like losing myself so much as a part of myself.\" When she looks back, she says, \"It seems I was this almost blithe, wilfully naive person to dare to take so much for granted - health, beauty.\" But now, she says, she is once again turning heads on the street and it's wonderful. \"Once, it was a burden to me. Now, it's the icing on the cake. In The Graduate, as Mrs Robinson, she will be dramatising once again an inversion of family value - the mother jealous of her daughter who tries then to subvert her romantic happiness. The sexually predatory, cunning older woman. She'll need all the humour and the irony that she can muster if this is not to look like some kind of dinosaur of sexual politics. Johnson's script, she says, is far cleverer than the cutesy film script. \"In the film, Katharine Ross had nothing to say; she just had to look good, be an icon of prettiness.\" Whereas in the play, Elaine Robinson \"will be a real person.\" Real and unreal. \"It is the bane of every actor's life,\" she says. \"The confusion between the person and the role.\" You don't know me, is what she says to the people who greet her in the street. \"You know my work.\" But this can't be entirely right. For the actor, as for any artist, if the work is going to have any meaning at all it must demonstrate in some way what the actor has learned in life up to that point. Otherwise, it's no more than a cartoon. There are bound to be correlations. Turner is an honest actor who is also an honest woman \u0095 The Graduate opens at the Gielgud Theatre, London, on April 5.

      "body": "<p>First of all, there are the facts. Sylvia Plath, the American poet, committed suicide in 1963 at the age of 30, gassing herself in her London flat after leaving out bread and milk for her two children, a daughter of nearly three and a son of 13 months, who were sleeping in an upstairs bedroom. Her husband, Ted Hughes, who subsequently became poet laureate, had recently left her. The woman with whom he was having an affair, Assia Wevill, also killed herself six years later. Plath's father had died when she was eight; she suffered depression all her life, and attempted suicide, almost succeeding, at 20. </p> <p>There are her poems, some of the most brilliant of the 20th century, the finest of which - Daddy, Lady Lazarus, Edge - she wrote when in the most pain, in the last few months of her life: confessional, brutal, not-nice assessments of the viciousness of the world, her relationships with her father, mother and husband, and her belief that \"Dying is an art . . . I do it exceptionally well.\" </p> <p>There is her novel, The Bell Jar, largely autobiographical, about her breakdown, psychiatric treatment and electro-convulsive therapy. </p> <p>There are her husband's poems, also some of the most brilliant of the modern age. Birthday Letters, a book about his relationship with Plath that was published only months before his death in 1998, revealed at last Hughes's torment about his first wife's untimely death. </p> <p>There are her letters to her mother: cheery, happy-go-lucky, all-American confidence that the world was a much, much jollier place than it ever seemed in her poetry. </p> <p>And there are the attempts to claim her life story after her death, to assert a real \"truth\" - five biographies, each causing a major controversy (either they were too anti-Hughes, in which case Hughes and his sister Olwyn refused to allow the writer to quote Plath's poems in full, or they were too pro-Hughes, which Plath-lovers thought betrayed her memory), and countless memoirs: from a neighbour she knew in her village, from a woman she met at college, from the man in the downstairs flat. In fact, the most insightful book written about the Plath phenomenon is not a biography at all, but an analysis of the analyses, an interpretation of the interpretations - Janet Malcolm's electric 1994 The Silent Woman, which looked at the Plath/Hughes industry, rather than at Plath and Hughes themselves. </p> <p>In all of this, Plath has remained, in Malcolm's words, the silent woman. A few recordings exist of her poetry readings - her voice is throaty, powerful, unforgettable - but we have never heard from Sylvia Plath, in her own words, the words she wrote in private, for herself, to try to make sense of the inner life that was ultimately to destroy her. Until now, her journals have never been published in full, anywhere. A much-truncated version, about a third of the total length, was published in the US in 1982; it was co-edited by Hughes, and his omissions are illuminating about the former poet laureate. But only in Britain are we now able to read all of her words - or all that survive - in the original. </p> <p>The journals reveal, more than anything, a woman in conflict. In an early entry, she writes, \"God, is this all it is, the ricocheting down the corridor of laughter and tears? Of self-worship and self-loathing? Of glory and disgust?\" But they also expose a multi- layered identity, many elements of which were ahead of her time. Sometimes, she's the 50s housewife (\"I married a real poet, and my life is redeemed: to love, serve and create\"); sometimes, she's the sexually-liberated 60s child (\"We had a very good f'ing. Enormously good, perhaps the best yet\"); sometimes, the 70s feminist (\"I must move myself first, before I move others - a woman famous among women\"); sometimes, the 90s Bridget Jones (\"Don't drink much. Be friendly &amp; more subdued. Work on inner life - to enrich.\") If we add these elements to the fact that Plath is forever stuck in the role of victim - always the young mother abandoned with two children, always the brilliant woman destroyed by her husband's faithlessness - it becomes clear why she has been, in many ways, an icon for women. </p> <p>It is here in her diaries that Plath reveals what she really thinks - about her depression, about her sexuality and about Hughes. Hughes burned the journal from the last few months before her death (\"I destroyed it because I did not want her children to have to read it,\" he said. \"In those days, I regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival.\"), and the last diary before that disappeared (there is a belief that a female friend of Hughes's took it while on a visit to his house after Plath's death, and that it might still turn up). But the picture Plath paints of early married life with her \"demigod\", the \"big, blasting dangerous love\", is often passionate, sexy and loving - more real than any attempts to describe it by others. </p> <p>An icon who died young, Plath has come to be defined by her death, as if her life was worth nothing except as a preamble to the big event. Perhaps, in some ways, that's as she saw it herself. Certainly the poems obsessed with death fascinate us more because we know what happened to her; just as the journal entries in which she ponders what her life may be at 40 - when we know that she died at 30 - or complains about a wonky car exhaust slowly gassing her - when we know that she gassed herself to death - are almost unbearably poignant. </p> <p>The journals remind us that there was a time when Sylvia Plath was alive and living - angry, happy, distressed, bitchy, silly, right, wrong. In her own words, without the filter of biography or poetry, here, the silent woman speaks for herself.</p>",

In fact, the most insightful book written about the Plath phenomenon is not a biography at all, but an analysis of the analyses, an interpretation of the interpretations - Janet Malcolm's electric 1994 The Silent Woman, which looked at the Plath/Hughes industry, rather than at Plath and Hughes themselves. In all of this, Plath has remained, in Malcolm's words, the silent woman. A few recordings exist of her poetry readings - her voice is throaty, powerful, unforgettable - but we have never heard from Sylvia Plath, in her own words, the words she wrote in private, for herself, to try to make sense of the inner life that was ultimately to destroy her. Until now, her journals have never been published in full, anywhere. A much-truncated version, about a third of the total length, was published in the US in 1982; it was co-edited by Hughes, and his omissions are illuminating about the former poet laureate. But only in Britain are we now able to read all of her words - or all that survive - in the original. The journals reveal, more than anything, a woman in conflict. In an early entry, she writes, \"God, is this all it is, the ricocheting down the corridor of laughter and tears? Of self-worship and self-loathing? Of glory and disgust?\" But they also expose a multi- layered identity, many elements of which were ahead of her time. Sometimes, she's the 50s housewife (\"I married a real poet, and my life is redeemed: to love, serve and create\"); sometimes, she's the sexually-liberated 60s child (\"We had a very good f'ing. Enormously good, perhaps the best yet\"); sometimes, the 70s feminist (\"I must move myself first, before I move others - a woman famous among women\"); sometimes, the 90s Bridget Jones (\"Don't drink much. Be friendly &amp; more subdued. Work on inner life - to enrich.\") If we add these elements to the fact that Plath is forever stuck in the role of victim - always the young mother abandoned with two children, always the brilliant woman destroyed by her husband's faithlessness - it becomes clear why she has been, in many ways, an icon for women. It is here in her diaries that Plath reveals what she really thinks - about her depression, about her sexuality and about Hughes. Hughes burned the journal from the last few months before her death (\"I destroyed it because I did not want her children to have to read it,\" he said. \"In those days, I regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival.\"), and the last diary before that disappeared (there is a belief that a female friend of Hughes's took it while on a visit to his house after Plath's death, and that it might still turn up). But the picture Plath paints of early married life with her \"demigod\", the \"big, blasting dangerous love\", is often passionate, sexy and loving - more real than any attempts to describe it by others. An icon who died young, Plath has come to be defined by her death, as if her life was worth nothing except as a preamble to the big event. Perhaps, in some ways, that's as she saw it herself. Certainly the poems obsessed with death fascinate us more because we know what happened to her; just as the journal entries in which she ponders what her life may be at 40 - when we know that she died at 30 - or complains about a wonky car exhaust slowly gassing her - when we know that she gassed herself to death - are almost unbearably poignant. The journals remind us that there was a time when Sylvia Plath was alive and living - angry, happy, distressed, bitchy, silly, right, wrong. In her own words, without the filter of biography or poetry, here, the silent woman speaks for herself.",

      "body": "<p>A building can be big, small, imposing, even beautiful - it can also, if you're architects Ushida Findlay, be soft and hairy, too. In 1992, the Anglo-Japanese partnership was high on the success of its first project, the Echo Chamber, when a young couple phoned with an unusual request. They had seen the Echo Chamber in the Tokyo suburbs and had loved the way the house seemed to wrap itself around its courtyard, creating both privacy and a sense of space. They had also read Dal\u00ed's prediction that architecture would one day be soft and hairy, and wanted a part of this future for themselves. Would Eisaku Ushida and Kathryn Findlay oblige?</p> <p>Would they indeed. The house was built in Tsukuba New Science City, a relatively green area on the edge of the Tokyo commuter belt. As well as the soft and hairy part, says Findlay, the clients \"wanted to have some kind of message for the neighbours - not to destroy the environment\". So, the turf roof has been allowed to grow wild, as a reminder of the unkempt, scrubby wilderness that was there before. As for the building, like the Echo Chamber, it too wraps itself around a central courtyard, the outside walls gently curving to accentuate its flowing form. And, in one corner - a nod, no doubt, to the surrealist inspiration for the whole place - there is a blue, egg-shaped pod with a bathroom inside.</p> <p>Inside, the walls are hung with canvas, a door is covered in fake fur, and plants are draped from their pots. \"The form is soft, like the lining of someone's lungs,\" says Findlay. And the hairiness? \"Obvious - hairiness implies something a bit out of control. The thing is that everything in Japan is under control and it's a way of saying everything doesn't have to be like that.\"</p> <p>Findlay and Ushida met in Japan in the early 80s. Britain at the time was depressed: economically, emotionally and, at least in terms of what was being built, creatively. Architecture that got made tended towards the historical pastiche, and Prince Charles was blathering on about carbuncles.</p> <p>\"When I first moved to Japan,\" says Findlay, \"the UK architecture scene was very dull. Everything seemed to be about renovation. I was very interested in the energy that Japan had. To get started and to do interesting things is much easier in Japan.\" Those \"interesting things\" include the Truss Wall House, a dwelling that is voluptuous with humps and curves: a seemingly continuous piece of moulded concrete that is as far as you can get from the image of straight lines and cold, unforgiving surfaces. The building technique is also highly innovative, its flowing form created by a frame of bent steel reinforcing bars, overlaid with wire mesh, on to which concrete was poured. In a similar vein is Polyphony, a house that seems to spiral from a central cylinder and that has a grand piano at its core. \"It was for a couple who loved music. We designed all the rooms so you could play and hear music. There was a parallel between the structure of the building and the repetitive acoustic cycles in music, so I suppose the house is a metaphor for cyclical music.\"</p> <p>Findlay spends most of her time in Japan, where she is associate professor of architecture at Tokyo University. That a woman holds such a senior position at the country's most prestigious academic institution is impressive enough. That she is also not Japanese is unprecedented.</p> <p>Still, it was not until the completion of Polyphony in 1997 that Ushida and Findlay were confident enough to expand to London. The move has brought huge dividends, with the five-member UK practice now bigger than the Japanese arm. The firm recently completed its largest project to date: a lozenge-shaped apartment building in Glasgow, characteristically organic in form, rounded at the front and with a series of cascading terraces.</p> <p>While much of Ushida Findlay's work appears to be state of the art, the architects themselves are not easily categorised. Not for them the po-faced rigours of minimalism, or the olde-worlde with mod cons of the Prince Charles set. Their buildings look space-age, but in a retro kind of way, and they aren't frightened to exploit traditional crafts, where appropriate. A pool that they are building in the Sussex countryside, for example, has a hi-tech glass surround, but is topped by a thatched roof - not only does this blend in with the farmhouse it sits behind, but it means that, should the roof ever need fixing, expert local labour should be relatively easy to come by.</p> <p>In another current project, just south of London's Blackfriars Bridge, they have created a Japanese interior inside three loft-style flats that have been knocked into one - walk through the front door, and you're greeted by a Japanese-style platform of tatami mats concealed behind shoji screens, its aspect facing windows overlooking the Thames.</p> <p>There is, says Findlay, a \"continuity\" running through their work, however. \"I'm really interested in sustainability. When you first become interested, you're confronted with this forest of information, and it's difficult as an architect to deal with it all - how to insulate walls properly, control airflow.\" The solution, then, is \"to develop a design attitude which can embody sustainability but in a language which is more fluid. Sometimes, it can be almost not there, sometimes just part of the ground. So it's less fairly obvious.\"</p> <p>For example, Findlay (this time as the Kathryn Findlay Laboratory, with Tomoko Taguchi) has designed buildings that not only takes account of the elements, but whose form is dictated by them. At the almost finished Kasahara community meeting hall in Gifu, Japan, the eaves are designed to be low enough to protect visitors from strong sun in summer and high enough to let in light in winter. And, in a competition project for an art gallery in Aormori, the building is sloped so that drifting snow will catch on the roof, insulating the inside. \"If you have a rigorous system with no tolerance, that doesn't give you the most sustainable options,\" says Findlay of the notion of \"schools\" of architecture. Design, she adds, \"shouldn't just appeal to the intellect, but to the senses, too.\" It is synaethesia in design. \"The sound of a bell, say, makes you feel cool. A bell rings because wind passes through it, so if you hear a bell you think of wind, which makes you feel cool.\"</p> <p>It is this latter attitude that prevails in Japan, while, says Findlay, sustainability is explored more in British design. Ushida Findlay, with a finger in both pies, can take the best from the two countries, yet, culturally and intellectually, belongs to neither. All the better, says Findlay: \"You can stand on the edge of Japan and see how they do things, but you're not absorbed by it. It's the same in Britain. There is always this stateless thing that allows you to be more fluid.\" Or, in the case of one house in Tsukuba New Science City, soft and hairy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Try getting your tongue around Ktima Voyatsi. Not a smooth ride is it? Greek wine rarely is, and Ktima Voyatsi 1997 is Greek, extremely red, but very far from rough (though it's good and ready). And very proud of it, it is, too. Oddbins stocks the wine, of course (but at its Fine Wine stores only, alas, for even Oddbins couldn't get hold of enough to stretch to every branch), as it's the only place that's bonkers enough to stock it. The wine costs \u00a37.99, my life! Who in her, or even his, right mind lays out \u00a37.99 on a Greek red? Outside a restaurant, that is.</p> <p>And this is, I fancy, where Ktima Voyatsi 1997 scores (16 points, out of 20, as it happens), for what better wine than this one to go with one of those Greek lamb dishes that slow-roast for a fortnight with a thousand cloves of garlic? You just have to find a taverna that permits BYO custom. The wine has astonishingly savoury tannins and a delightfully chewy texture, and exhibits deep, black fruit of style and savour. It is an exceedingly bravura wine. It tastes as if it has been hewn out of mountains strewn with herbs, bracken and glacial boulders. </p> <p>Sainsbury's Mont Gras Carmenere Reserva 1998 is a different side of a different mountainside altogether (smooth rather than rocky, Andean rather than Olympian). Being Chilean, it is ineffably sveltely textured though, being carmenere, it has a hint of louche mystery about it, too. For years, Chileans grew carmenere - a somewhat discredited old Bordeaux variety, now vanished from there - but thought it was merlot, and were much aggrieved when a wandering ampelographer (a vine boffin, to you and me) popped up and told them what it was. We will, I suspect, be seeing it more and more as a vinified individual variety, as its delicious combination of rich tannicity and jammy fruitiness gains favour. This example rates 16 points, costs \u00a35.99, and merlot it ain't. </p> <p>Diemersdal Merlot 1998, however, very definitely is merlot, though I'm grateful that the label informed me of the fact because this Cape wine's presence on the palate offers no huge clues. It is rich, ripe, rivetingly well-packed with lush, fruity flavours, and it goes all squashy and meaty on the finish. It rates 15.5 points and costs \u00a35.69 at Tesco. Bela Fonte Baga 1998, from Portugal, is spikier; a vigorously fresh-edged and keenly tannic specimen, it has food-friendly cherry/plum fruit, and is textured and taut. It rates 15.5 points and costs \u00a34.79 at Tesco. Also at Tesco is Domaine du Soleil Syrah/Malbec Vin de Pays d'Oc, a non-vintage wine rating 14.5 points and costing \u00a33.99. It is delicious and, though something of a rustic country bumpkin, comes across daintily on the finish. </p> <p>Tesco also has some interesting special offers, ending on March 28, on four worthy reds. Trulli Primitivo del Salento 1998, from Italy (14 points, price down to \u00a33.79), is juicy yet very dry to finish. The own-label Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon (14 points, reduced to \u00a33.49) has a warm, brisk edge of no-nonsense fruitiness, is sympathetic to the tastebuds, bold to the throat, and most agreeable with roast meat and grilled, cheesy vegetables. The own-label French Grenache Prestige (14.5 points, reduced to \u00a32.99) smells a mite vegetal, but gets into terrific fruity gear on the tastebuds and is also an excellent food wine. As is African Legend Pinotage 1998, from the Cape. This 14-point wine, with the typical, burned aroma and rampantly soft fruit of this native grape, is also a specimen of the hearty quaffing variety and as such may perform best consumed from a Viking horn. Certainly, fancy glassware is inappropriate, not because the wine's price has been lopped down to \u00a33.99 but because it is so unpretentiously drinkable and lush. </p> <p>As if the scantiness of these prices were not enough, I am informed that all Tesco wines, including the ones above, will be subject to further price cuts from tomorrow until close of business on the 25th - that is, if you buy six bottles of any wine, or six of mixed wines, you get a 20% discount as well.

My idea of Gothic is more Salisbury Cathedral. But though Henry and Holly are apart, the air sizzles with recrimination. She rings up several times a day and just breathes moodily. I know it's her. I can hear her nose-rings rattling.</p> <p>Gabrielle, my new pupil, is a little more whole-some, visually. She wears trainers, jeans and loose tunics. She sinks down into her loose tunic while I am coaching her, and pulls down the sleeves to protect her fingernails from my horrible breath. I am acid rain personified. I could probably destroy Salisbury Cathedral in a weekend just by exhaling in an ecstasy of contemplation. \"The end of an essay is very important, Gabrielle,\" I urge, malodorously. \"Try and finish off with a quotation, it gives it panache.\" Gabrielle frowns, too polite to ask what panache is. \"Panache,\" I continue, \"bazazz - you know, sparkle, fizz.\" Trust none of the aforementioned are street slang for drugs.</p> <p>Nearly half-past. Get up, accept Gabrielle's envelope, smile encouragingly. \"You're doing brilliantly!\" I assure her, then trip over her bag in my urgent desire to get her out of the house. She slithers sideways along the hall wall. She wants to escape, too. We both want exactly the same out of this relationship: for it to end. With or without panache.</p> <p>Find Henry slumped in a chair, the phone in his ear, watching MTV and occasionally muttering \"yeah\" or \"nah\".

      "bodyText": "'Mum? I wish Henry hadn't finished with Holly. She was really, like, cool.\" Harriet admired Holly's Gothic style, the black buckles, the cobweb sleeves, the spiky dog-collar. My idea of Gothic is more Salisbury Cathedral. But though Henry and Holly are apart, the air sizzles with recrimination. She rings up several times a day and just breathes moodily. I know it's her. I can hear her nose-rings rattling. Gabrielle, my new pupil, is a little more whole-some, visually. She wears trainers, jeans and loose tunics. She sinks down into her loose tunic while I am coaching her, and pulls down the sleeves to protect her fingernails from my horrible breath. I am acid rain personified. I could probably destroy Salisbury Cathedral in a weekend just by exhaling in an ecstasy of contemplation. \"The end of an essay is very important, Gabrielle,\" I urge, malodorously. \"Try and finish off with a quotation, it gives it panache.\" Gabrielle frowns, too polite to ask what panache is. \"Panache,\" I continue, \"bazazz - you know, sparkle, fizz.\" Trust none of the aforementioned are street slang for drugs. Nearly half-past. Get up, accept Gabrielle's envelope, smile encouragingly. \"You're doing brilliantly!\" I assure her, then trip over her bag in my urgent desire to get her out of the house. She slithers sideways along the hall wall. She wants to escape, too. We both want exactly the same out of this relationship: for it to end. With or without panache. Find Henry slumped in a chair, the phone in his ear, watching MTV and occasionally muttering \"yeah\" or \"nah\". Harriet hovers, eavesdropping. \"Holly's trying to get him back!\" she whispers. \"Mum, can you take me to Camden Market for my birthday?\" Sudden rogue impulse tempts me to agree.

      "body": "<p><strong>Sunday, March, 5, 2000, Arthur Askey Way </strong></p> <p> I spent the day debating with myself - should I continue to fight the tracksuit-trousers ban on Glenn's behalf or should I give in, thus subjecting the lad to mental torture during cross-country runs and possible trauma in later life? I rang around and sought the opinion of others. My father reminded me that he had \"gone out on a limb\" to support me when I stood up against the tyrannical headmaster, pop-eyed Scruton, by wearing red socks to school, thereby defying the black-socks-only rule. My mother said, \"Give in, Aidy - you can't beat Jack Straw's authoritarian regime.\" </p> <p> I rang my MP, Pandora Braithwaite, who had joined me in my red-socks rebellion 20 years ago. She said, \"Can't talk now, darling, I've got Ken and Frank round for dinner, and I'm about to serve the pig's brains in goat's cheese.\" So, it is as I suspected all along! Ken Livingstone and Frank Dobson are hand-in-glove with each other. Their true enemy is Tony Blair. They have conspired to make Mr Blair look as though he can't control his party. </p> <p> After Glenn had gone to bed, I wrote to his headmaster, Roger Patience: </p> <p> Dear Mr Patience, </p> <p> My son, Glenn Bott, has abnormally thin legs, of which he is very self-conscious. In the circumstances, would you please make an exception to your PE-shorts-only rule and allow him to wear tracksuit trousers during cross-country runs. </p> <p> Yours, A A Mole </p> <p><strong> Tuesday, March 7, Shrove Tuesday </strong></p> <p> Peggy Ludlow came round at tea-time to borrow flour, a lemon, eggs, milk, a frying pan and oil. I said, sarcastically, \"Wouldn't it be simpler if I made your pancakes in my kitchen?\" She agreed, and the whole Ludlow family trooped round and sat in my living room watching Jerry Springer while I tossed in the kitchen until my wrist was aching. </p> <p> Vince Ludlow doesn't seem to do any work, though his family are always well rigged-out in designer clothes. Peggy continues to invade my thoughts. Today she was wearing a snakeskin sleeveless shift dress. It was the first time I'd seen her upper arms. She has several tattoos, the most recent being a depiction of Jeremy Paxman's head. When I said that I, too, was a fan of Newsnight, she said that she had asked for Jeremy Clarkson and was suing the tattooist. </p> <p><strong> Wednesday, March 8, Ash Wednesday </strong></p> <p> My mother invited me and the boys to a No Smoking Day party to celebrate her proposed new status as a non-smoker. We arrived slightly late, at 7.30. She answered the door looking irritable: \"You've missed the ashtray-smashing ceremony.\" At 7.45, she smoked her last cigarette in the garden, surrounded by family and friends. Tears ran down her tobacco-ravaged face. Ivan then ceremoniously applied a nicotine patch to her upper-arm. When I strolled back into the house, it didn't seem the same without its perpetual pall of smoke.

      "bodyText": "Sunday, March, 5, 2000, Arthur Askey Way I spent the day debating with myself - should I continue to fight the tracksuit-trousers ban on Glenn's behalf or should I give in, thus subjecting the lad to mental torture during cross-country runs and possible trauma in later life? I rang around and sought the opinion of others. My father reminded me that he had \"gone out on a limb\" to support me when I stood up against the tyrannical headmaster, pop-eyed Scruton, by wearing red socks to school, thereby defying the black-socks-only rule. My mother said, \"Give in, Aidy - you can't beat Jack Straw's authoritarian regime.\" I rang my MP, Pandora Braithwaite, who had joined me in my red-socks rebellion 20 years ago. She said, \"Can't talk now, darling, I've got Ken and Frank round for dinner, and I'm about to serve the pig's brains in goat's cheese.\" So, it is as I suspected all along! Ken Livingstone and Frank Dobson are hand-in-glove with each other. Their true enemy is Tony Blair. They have conspired to make Mr Blair look as though he can't control his party. After Glenn had gone to bed, I wrote to his headmaster, Roger Patience: Dear Mr Patience, My son, Glenn Bott, has abnormally thin legs, of which he is very self-conscious. In the circumstances, would you please make an exception to your PE-shorts-only rule and allow him to wear tracksuit trousers during cross-country runs. Yours, A A Mole Tuesday, March 7, Shrove Tuesday Peggy Ludlow came round at tea-time to borrow flour, a lemon, eggs, milk, a frying pan and oil. I said, sarcastically, \"Wouldn't it be simpler if I made your pancakes in my kitchen?\" She agreed, and the whole Ludlow family trooped round and sat in my living room watching Jerry Springer while I tossed in the kitchen until my wrist was aching. Vince Ludlow doesn't seem to do any work, though his family are always well rigged-out in designer clothes. Peggy continues to invade my thoughts. Today she was wearing a snakeskin sleeveless shift dress. It was the first time I'd seen her upper arms. She has several tattoos, the most recent being a depiction of Jeremy Paxman's head. When I said that I, too, was a fan of Newsnight, she said that she had asked for Jeremy Clarkson and was suing the tattooist. Wednesday, March 8, Ash Wednesday My mother invited me and the boys to a No Smoking Day party to celebrate her proposed new status as a non-smoker. We arrived slightly late, at 7.30. She answered the door looking irritable: \"You've missed the ashtray-smashing ceremony.\" At 7.45, she smoked her last cigarette in the garden, surrounded by family and friends. Tears ran down her tobacco-ravaged face. Ivan then ceremoniously applied a nicotine patch to her upper-arm. When I strolled back into the house, it didn't seem the same without its perpetual pall of smoke. No reply yet from Patience regarding the tracksuit trousers. Thursday, March 9 A telephone call from the school secretary to tell me that Roger Patience can now be reached only on the following e-mail address: patience.com@sailschool Friday, March 10 I called on my mother unexpectedly this afternoon: she was smoking a cigarette and both wearing nicotine and chewing it. She begged me not to tell Ivan. Saturday, March 11 I went to see Pandora at the ceremony to close down the community centre on this estate. She told me that her dinner guests were Ken Dodd and Frank Skinner - a grim night, then.",

The vote in Berlin came after the European commission had begun legal action against Germany in the European court of justice in Luxembourg. Moves against France continue.

The bans date to the EU decision in March 1996 prohibiting the export of all British beef after the announcement of a possible link between mad cow disease or BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The bans led to a period of confrontation between Britain and its EU partners, the slaughter of millions of cattle, curbs on the use of animal feed, and a comprehensive cattle tracing system. Last August the commission allowed British beef exports to resume provided the meat was from cattle born in the preceding three years. But France and Germany continued to balk.

He said he would not tolerate \"this kind of poor management in any NHS hospital\". </p> <p>The hospital removed the organs of 893 dead children without their parents' consent. </p> <p>Ian Cohen, a solicitor representing the families of 200 children whose organs were retained, said he believed the Stephen White case was just one example of a culture of poor management at the hospital. </p> <p>\"But the Stephen White case is probably the most severe example,\" he said. </p> <p>A support group representing the families is demanding that criminal charges be brought against hospital staff. The Pity II group has written to the chief constable of Merseyside, Norman Bettison, to ask him to take action. Joan Wheeler, the group's chairwoman, said: \"Our children's organs have been robbed, they have been stolen and we want to bring about formal charges against the hospital.\" </p> <p>Superintendent John Gilvary, of Merseyside police, said: \"We have to look at it totally objectively and have to respond carefully and professionally within the correct legislation provided.\"</p> <p><b>Arson at flat killed 19 parrots</b> </p> <p>A woman was jailed for two years yesterday for setting light to her boyfriend's flat and killing 19 of his parrots. </p> <p>Anna Seeley, 32, was told by the judge, Oliver Sells QC, at the Old Bailey, that the public had to be protected from her repeating such a dangerous act. </p> <p>Doctors told the court that Seeley was suffering from post-natal depression when she started fires in two wardrobes and a sofa at Douglas Anderson's flat in Croydon, south London, in September last year. </p> <p>Mr Anderson, 47, kept 24 parrots, valued at \u00a32,600.

      "bodyText": "The 70s children's television character Mr Benn is set for his biggest adventure yet - making it on to the cinema screen. British film makers are poised to start shooting the cult cartoon series and update the bowler hatted adventurer to appeal to a modern adult audience. The \u00a34m project will be a live action feature film and big name actors are already being lined up to play the main parts. John Hannah from Sliding Doors and Four Weddings and a Funeral will play Mr Benn, while Oscar winner Ben Kingsley, best known for his leading role in Gandhi, has signed up to play the shopkeeper. Movie makers have updated Mr Benn's lifestyle. He will have a girlfriend, played by Absolutely Fabulous star Jane Horrocks; a job in a museum; and he will speak (the cartoons were narrated by the actor Ray Brooks). Unlike the crudely animated cartoon, Mr Benn's knees will move. Some saw the cartoon's plots as drawing inspiration from hippy culture. In Mr Benn, the suited cartoon character left 52 Festive Road and wandered into a costume shop - he never went to work. The shopkeeper would invite him to try on an outfit he had never tried before, and after stepping through \"the other door\" into the supposed changing room, Mr Benn would escape the mundanity of everyday life and have an adventure. After learning a moral lesson, the shopkeeper would bring the adventure to an end and Mr Benn would return to reality. Only 13 episodes of Mr Benn were made for the BBC. The series was first broadcast in 1971, though its popularity was such it was repeated for years afterwards. The film's director, Jevon O'Neill, said: \"The plot is about a man looking for a purpose in his life. He has a series of adventures and ends up realising he's able to seize more opportunities in life than he has so far. It has a life affirming quality, looking at one man's journey to fulfil his potential.\" In the film, he will set off on his travels in pursuit of his tragic lost love, Monica McBride. The makers of Mr Benn say it will be an unusual British movie, breaking out of the usual costume and gritty urban drama. Mr O'Neill's Erinfilm company bought the movie rights from the TV series' creator David McKee. Mr O'Neill added: \"We've been working closely with the original TV show's creators and rights owners, and they are happy with the script. \"At the moment, we are in the process of finalising funding for the project, but in an ideal world we could start pre-production in a couple of months' time. \"The film will be set in England, and it will have a very quirky British feel to it, but until all the funding is in place we will not know exactly where it is going to be filmed.\" From small to big screen The Magic Roundabout Much-loved psychedelic 60s show spawned the equally trippy Dougal and the Blue Cat. The Muppets Inspired a series of films about Kermit and Miss Piggy and even saw Michael Caine taking a leading role in their most recent big screen adventure. The Flintstones Stone-age cartoon took a disastrous turn when John Goodman took the lead in a live-action feature. The Rugrats Highly successful transfer to the silver screen for this US cartoon. South Park Controversial US cartoon, featuring foul-mouthed teenagers, was also made into a movie.",

      "bodyText": "An internal police review published yesterday into last year's controversial state visit by the Chinese president was condemned as a \"whitewash\" by Free Tibet campaigners after it concluded that \"no improper influence\" was exerted on police by the foreign office. Scotland Yard took the unusual step of releasing the routine internal review following widespread public disquiet about the heavy-handed policing of President Jiang Zemin's four-day visit last October. It revealed that the British and Chinese governments had expressed concerns to the police about demonstrations ahead of the visit, although it denied that the foreign and commonwealth office had put pressure on the police to crack down on demonstrators to prevent embarrassment to the Chinese authorities. The assistant police commissioner Ian Johnston admitted there were \"inevitably lessons to be learned\" but said there was no conspiracy to suppress lawful demonstration and many noisy demonstrations by campaigners opposed to China's occupation of Tibet had been allowed to take place. He accepted that mistakes had been made but insisted: \"By and large I think we did a pretty good job in difficult circumstances.\" The report made six recommendations, including calling for minutes to be taken at all future planning meetings for state visits between police and foreign office officials, and for formalised codes of practice be introduced for ceremonial events. The review found that flags and banners were taken from pro-Tibet demonstrators at Horse Guards Parade because of the \"threat to public order and the dignity of Jiang Zemin\" and that vans were used to reinforce police lines when tensions increased, but that some were \"parked unwittingly\" in front of protesters. But Mr Johnston highlighted one incident when a group of officers arrested a cyclist, admitting: \"Five people on one chap on a bike can look heavy-handed.\" He said there was a \"fine balance\"between the right to free protest and the rights of visiting dignitories under the Vienna convention to have their \"dignity preserved\".

Six officers - previously named on the internet but never in print - are identified in MI6, Fifty Years of Special Operations, to be published by Fourth Estate later this month. The author, Stephen Dorril, says MI6 drew up plans to kill Mr Milosevic in 1992 after evidence emerged he was supplying arms to the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic. Plans included training a Serbian opposition group to carry out the assassination, training an SAS cell to do it, or killing the president in a staged road crash during one of his visits to an international conference in Geneva on the future of Yugoslavia, the book alleges. The book also identifies an MI6 officer who wrote articles for the Spectator magazine criticising journalists covering the Bosnian civil war as well as the UN's role there. Mr Dorril describes the activities of an MI6 section called I/Ops, for Information Operations, whose job is to plant favourable stories in newspapers. Mr Dorril said: \"Though it's not a 'naming names' book it gives the opportunity for the British public to see material about MI6 available throughout the rest of the world.\"",

Several of his MPs expressed amazement.</p> <p>Mr Trimble said he would consider taking a government before guns plan to his party again only if he were convinced that the IRA's war was over. He would require guarantees of decommissioning to follow, rather than the vague aspirations which accompanied his decision to go into the power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein last November.</p> <p>Mr Trimble, addressing the National Press Club, said: \"The critical thing is that if we are going to have a sequence in the future: is it going to work? We can't move unless it is quite clear it is going to work.</p> <p>\"I have made it clear that we are prepared to be involved in a fresh sequence which probably will not involve arms up front but it has to involve the issue being dealt with and the matter working. The only people who can answer that is the republican movement.\"</p> <p>Washington sources were playing down hopes of a breakthrough, but the development was in stark contrast to the gloomy atmosphere which has marked St Patrick's Day at the White House this year.

      "bodyText": "David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, provided a rare glimmer of hope for the peace process in Northern Ireland when he unexpectedly said he would be prepared to re-enter government with Sinn Fein without prior IRA arms decommissioning. His comments, made on St Patrick's Day in Washington, threw Unionists into turmoil, and suggested Mr Trimble would face a rough ride ahead of next Saturday's annual meeting of his 860-strong ruling council. Several of his MPs expressed amazement. Mr Trimble said he would consider taking a government before guns plan to his party again only if he were convinced that the IRA's war was over. He would require guarantees of decommissioning to follow, rather than the vague aspirations which accompanied his decision to go into the power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein last November. Mr Trimble, addressing the National Press Club, said: \"The critical thing is that if we are going to have a sequence in the future: is it going to work? We can't move unless it is quite clear it is going to work. \"I have made it clear that we are prepared to be involved in a fresh sequence which probably will not involve arms up front but it has to involve the issue being dealt with and the matter working. The only people who can answer that is the republican movement.\" Washington sources were playing down hopes of a breakthrough, but the development was in stark contrast to the gloomy atmosphere which has marked St Patrick's Day at the White House this year. President Clinton was meeting the parties last night. Mr Trimble's pronouncement surprised his MPs, in cluding Jeffrey Donaldson, a member of the party's steering group set up to oversee the talks. He predicted Mr Trimble would fail to persuade his party to back him again. Mr Donaldson, an opponent of the Good Friday agreement, was angry at not being consulted. He said: \"Having seen the institutions suspended because there was no decommissioning, people would find it difficult to understand why we would set them up again without decommissioning.\" Mr Trimble's comments came shortly after Jonathan Bell, the Craigavon councillor who had threatened to run as a stalking horse challenger to his leadership next week, said he was quitting the party because he believed Mr Trimble was preparing to return to government without decommissioning. The Democratic Unionist deputy leader, Peter Robinson, and the UK Unionist party chief, Robert McCartney, were scathing about Mr Trimble. Mr Robinson said he was earning the name Putty Man, \"easily shaped by presidents, prime ministers and provos\". He added: \"As someone who has been made to look a fool on many occasions, you might have expected more caution from someone like him.\" The Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, accused Mr Trimble of spinning the media. Mr Trimble's approach reflects growing doubts that decommissioning was the correct issue on which to gauge republican intentions. Both the army and the RUC believe it has no security value. The Real IRA explosives found in Hillborough, Co Down, on Wednesday were home made, with the usual ingredients including fertiliser, sugar and diesel. Security forces say it is impossible to decommission the engineering knowledge used to mix them.",

They also contain a string of intimate disclosures that shed new light on the complexity of Plath's sexuality, her depression and her hatred of her mother. </p> <p>After her first meeting with Hughes, at a Cambridge party, she wrote \"a full-page poem about the dark forces of lust: Pursuit. It is not bad. It is dedicated to Ted Hughes.\" </p> <p>Pursuit begins with the following lines: \"There is a panther stalks me down:/One day I'll have my death of him.\" </p> <p>Her diaries also reveal that, on the morning of their meeting, Plath had been to see a new psychiatrist. And straight after the party, despite their powerful mutual attraction - she bit Hughes's cheek until it bled - Plath had a sexual encounter with another man, a Canadian student, in his college rooms. </p> <p>\"I was just so damn grateful for his weight on me and his mouth which was nice, and begged that he scold me, and he just said I wasn't a whore or a slut like I said but only a very silly girl and he kind of liked me,\" she wrote. </p> <p>Plath dropped the Canadian when Hughes started turning up outside her room in the middle of the night. The diaries show how Hughes would shout her name and throw stones at what he thought was her window - although he got the wrong one. </p> <p>Hughes heavily censored the diaries 20 years ago, cutting out two-thirds of her words - much of them about himself. Only now are his omissions reinstated and the journals published in full. </p> <p>He excised Plath's comment that he was \"the biggest seducer in Cambridge\", and suggestions that he was vain. For instance he removed: \"Ted looked slovenly: his suit jacket wrinkled as if being pulled from behind, his pants hanging, unbelted, in great folds, his hair black and greasy in the light.\" Similarly cut was: \"Who knows who Ted's next book will be dedicated to? His navel. His penis.\" </p> <p>She went on to say, \"This is the vain, selfish face and voice I first saw and the Yorkshire beacon boy, a sweet and daily companion, is gone ... the dirt is too deep for Halo shampoo and Lux soap, the raggedness too far frayed for the neat nip of the trimming shears.\" </p> <p>In addition, Hughes had cut out references that Plath made to his depression, and some mentions of their sex life. </p> <p>But the diaries also show that their complicated seven-year relationship was frequently happy. She wrote often about her joy in finding \"the big, blasting, dangerous love\". </p> <p>That love began at that very first meeting. Plath described Hughes as \"that big, dark, hunky boy, the only one there huge enough for me\". He kissed her \"bang smash on the mouth\" and ripped off her headband and earrings - \"hah, I shall keep, he barked\" - before she bit him on the cheek. \"Such violence, and I can see how women lie down for artists,\" she wrote. </p> <p>Elsewhere she wrote: \"Good lovemaking today, morning and afternoon, all hot and hard and lovely.\" </p> <p>She confessed: \"All day I have to run about, a hundred times, to kiss him in his niche or in his bath, to sniff his smell of bread and grapes and kiss his delectable places\". </p> <p>Plath was determined to make her living as a writer, and worried about her dependence on Hughes. But, in entries that cast her more as a 1950s homemaker than the feminist icon she became, she wrote: \"Make him happy: cook, play, read ... never accuse or nag - let him run, reap, rip - and glory in the temporary sun of his ruthless force.\" She added: \"My God, I'd love to cook and make a house and surge force into a man's dreams.\" </p> <p>Plath had a tendency to very serious depression, and all her life she \"ricocheted\" between manic all-American smilingness and self-hating rage. </p> <p>The last journal before her suicide, when she gassed herself in her London flat while her two toddlers slept upstairs, was destroyed by Hughes, whose next partner, Assia Wevill, also killed herself. </p> <p>Another Plath diary disappeared several years after her death, assumed stolen. But the journal from 1953, leading up to Plath's first suicide attempt at the age of 20, provides shocking insight into the mind of a woman already spiralling out of control. She took an overdose of sleeping pills, was missing for two days and survived only because she took too many tablets and vomited. </p> <p>In entries that were censored in the US by Plath's mother, Aurelia, Sylvia wrote brutally about her hatred for her mother, to whom she felt inescapably attached but whom she blamed for the death of her father when she was eight.

      "body": "<p>There is a plaque on the wall of Ayr council chambers that spells out the motto of the town in gothic gold script. \"Ne'er forget the people of Ayr,\" it says.</p> <p>But many here believe Labour has wilfully ignored that message - and they have told them so in no uncertain terms, voting them into a humiliating third place in the Scottish parliament's historic first byelection, behind a victorious Conservative party and a resurgent Scottish National party.</p> <p>This weekend, as the Tories celebrate their first directly elected seat in the Scottish parliament and their first by-election win in Scotland for more than 30 years, the post-mortem for Labour begins in earnest.</p> <p>Coming second in a marginal seat could have been spun. Coming third and losing 16% of their vote is harder to explain, although the first minister, Donald Dewar, did try yesterday, blaming mid-term blues and distractions such as the row over section 28 for the failure of their candidate, Rita Miller.</p> <p>He said: \"Clearly it was from our point of view a disappointing result. No one likes being in third place. There have been distractions and it has been difficult to get through the basic issues because of these distractions. I think section 28 was certainly a factor. It was obviously difficult when all their campaign was directed against the Labour party.\"</p> <p>\"I am disappointed. I am going to look, listen and analyse and try to build on this, but there is no way I regard this as some sort of cataclysmic event.\"</p> <p>By his side, the Scottish secretary, John Reid, was characteristically blunt and less inclined to blame external forces. \"It is a poor result for us. There are no medals for losers. We will look, listen and learn from the result. There are occasions when the electorate blows a raspberry at all of us.\"</p> <p>But there are some who say the result is cataclysmic for the party, even on a UK level, and that it will raise fresh questions about Mr Dewar's leadership, the performance of the Labour-Lib Dem ruling coalition at Holyrood, and the general direction of New Labour under Tony Blair.</p> <p>John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde university, said: \"The message is that Tony Blair does not walk on air. It is all of a piece with the evidence of recent British polls, which is that Labour still has a stupendous lead, but it is narrowing. We shouldn't assume that this simply applies in Scotland.\"</p> <p>Labour's own grim assessment of its performance made clear that the lessons of a string of recent byelections have finally hit home. For all Downing Street's talk that the party's traditional supporters are delighted with Mr Blair, Labour is suffering a traditional mid-term slump in which core voters either stay at home or flock to other parties.</p> <p>Privately, senior Blairites are deeply concerned that Labour's voters are so uninspired that they may simply not bother turning out in next year's general election. Labour's strategists believe this is deeply unfair because the government has addressed the interests of core supporters across the board, from the minimum wage to the working families tax credit which tops up the pay of the less well off.</p> <p>However, traditionally-minded ministers, led by John Prescott, have admitted that there is a perception that the government is not addressing the concerns of its heartlands.</p> <p>Whatever the national picture, many in Ayr believe that one of Labour's biggest problems is that they didn't think locally.</p> <p>The successful Conservative candidate, John Scott, a well-known local farmer, has refused to treat Ayr as a proving ground for national issues like section 28. He concentrated instead on local concerns like the impending closure by the Labour-run local council of a well used and much loved day centre for the elderly. In a community with the highest proportion of over-55s in Scotland, the fate of Carrick Halls has become a defining issue of the byelection.</p> <p>Yesterday, as they enjoyed a St Patrick's day lunch, many of the centre's regular users said they had been lifelong Labour voters but had deserted the party willingly.</p> <p>\"It's a lifeline,\" said Mary Brown, 71. \"I was getting dressed this morning to come here and wondered, how much longer am I going to do this? It keeps people going. I used to vote Labour, but not this time, not after what they've done to us all. I'm pleased Mr Scott got in.\"</p> <p>So is the Tory hierarchy in Scotland. Both Labour and the SNP have tried to play down the significance of the Tory win in a seat which has been a Conservative stronghold for decades, before Labour took it in 1997. What's a 3,000 majority when your share of the vote has only risen by 1%, they say.</p> <p>Raymond Robertson, the party's Scottish chairman, said: \"It's a bloody good win for us.\" The party's Scottish leader, David McLetchie, said: \"It is a great day to be a Tory in Scotland and the UK. We have to look at the psychological boost this will give the Conservative party in Scotland as a whole.

      "bodyText": "There is a plaque on the wall of Ayr council chambers that spells out the motto of the town in gothic gold script. \"Ne'er forget the people of Ayr,\" it says. But many here believe Labour has wilfully ignored that message - and they have told them so in no uncertain terms, voting them into a humiliating third place in the Scottish parliament's historic first byelection, behind a victorious Conservative party and a resurgent Scottish National party. This weekend, as the Tories celebrate their first directly elected seat in the Scottish parliament and their first by-election win in Scotland for more than 30 years, the post-mortem for Labour begins in earnest. Coming second in a marginal seat could have been spun. Coming third and losing 16% of their vote is harder to explain, although the first minister, Donald Dewar, did try yesterday, blaming mid-term blues and distractions such as the row over section 28 for the failure of their candidate, Rita Miller. He said: \"Clearly it was from our point of view a disappointing result. No one likes being in third place. There have been distractions and it has been difficult to get through the basic issues because of these distractions. I think section 28 was certainly a factor. It was obviously difficult when all their campaign was directed against the Labour party.\" \"I am disappointed. I am going to look, listen and analyse and try to build on this, but there is no way I regard this as some sort of cataclysmic event.\" By his side, the Scottish secretary, John Reid, was characteristically blunt and less inclined to blame external forces. \"It is a poor result for us. There are no medals for losers. We will look, listen and learn from the result. There are occasions when the electorate blows a raspberry at all of us.\" But there are some who say the result is cataclysmic for the party, even on a UK level, and that it will raise fresh questions about Mr Dewar's leadership, the performance of the Labour-Lib Dem ruling coalition at Holyrood, and the general direction of New Labour under Tony Blair. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde university, said: \"The message is that Tony Blair does not walk on air. It is all of a piece with the evidence of recent British polls, which is that Labour still has a stupendous lead, but it is narrowing. We shouldn't assume that this simply applies in Scotland.\" Labour's own grim assessment of its performance made clear that the lessons of a string of recent byelections have finally hit home. For all Downing Street's talk that the party's traditional supporters are delighted with Mr Blair, Labour is suffering a traditional mid-term slump in which core voters either stay at home or flock to other parties. Privately, senior Blairites are deeply concerned that Labour's voters are so uninspired that they may simply not bother turning out in next year's general election. Labour's strategists believe this is deeply unfair because the government has addressed the interests of core supporters across the board, from the minimum wage to the working families tax credit which tops up the pay of the less well off. However, traditionally-minded ministers, led by John Prescott, have admitted that there is a perception that the government is not addressing the concerns of its heartlands. Whatever the national picture, many in Ayr believe that one of Labour's biggest problems is that they didn't think locally. The successful Conservative candidate, John Scott, a well-known local farmer, has refused to treat Ayr as a proving ground for national issues like section 28. He concentrated instead on local concerns like the impending closure by the Labour-run local council of a well used and much loved day centre for the elderly. In a community with the highest proportion of over-55s in Scotland, the fate of Carrick Halls has become a defining issue of the byelection. Yesterday, as they enjoyed a St Patrick's day lunch, many of the centre's regular users said they had been lifelong Labour voters but had deserted the party willingly. \"It's a lifeline,\" said Mary Brown, 71. \"I was getting dressed this morning to come here and wondered, how much longer am I going to do this? It keeps people going. I used to vote Labour, but not this time, not after what they've done to us all. I'm pleased Mr Scott got in.\" So is the Tory hierarchy in Scotland. Both Labour and the SNP have tried to play down the significance of the Tory win in a seat which has been a Conservative stronghold for decades, before Labour took it in 1997. What's a 3,000 majority when your share of the vote has only risen by 1%, they say. Raymond Robertson, the party's Scottish chairman, said: \"It's a bloody good win for us.\" The party's Scottish leader, David McLetchie, said: \"It is a great day to be a Tory in Scotland and the UK. We have to look at the psychological boost this will give the Conservative party in Scotland as a whole. The people of Scotland woke up this morning to see the Scottish Tories back in business.\" Analysts, meanwhile, say the Tories have the SNP to thank for their victory. The nationalists ran a slick campaign and saw their vote increase by more than 9% as disaffected Labour supporters swelled their ranks. One Carrick Halls regular, Alex Kelly, 75, said: \"There are a lot of disillusioned Labour voters in Ayr and for this election they decided to withhold their vote or go to another party. Labour have forgotten the people of Ayr and now they are living with the consequences.\" The count John Scott Conservative 12,580 Jim Mather Scottish Nationalist 9,236 Rita Miller Labour 7,054 James Stewart Scottish Socialist 1,345 Stuart Ritchie Liberal Democrat 800 Gavin Corbett Green 460 William Botcherby Ind Vet 186 Alistair McConnachie UK Ind 113 Robert Graham ProLife 111 Kevin Dillon Ind AC 15 Conservative majority: 3,344 Turnout: 56.96% 1999 Labour majority: 25 Turnout: 66.48%",

This was despite the judge's admission that the letter merely repeated allegations Mr Shayler had made about MI6 involvement in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Gadafy. Mr Shayler - in exile in Paris - wrote the letter to complain about a Guardian article suggesting that he was exaggerating the role of MI6. The judge also argued that a front-page report in the Observer last month stating Mr Shayler had named two MI6 officers involved in the plot was \"highly relevant\" to the police investigation, even though the newspaper did not identify them. The fact that Mr Shayler had already passed the information to the home secretary was not relevant, the judge ruled. Both newspapers immediately announced that they would challenge the judge's order, and would take it to the European court of human rights if necessary. Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, said last night: \"These police powers should only be used in exceptional circumstances against newspapers as they represent an interference with freedom of expression.

It's useful to remember that he was called Bird not for his dizzying flights on alto saxophone, or even for his long-standing determination to get and stay high - Parker started using the drug at the age of 15 - but for his prodigious appetite for \"yardbirds\", to say nothing of burgers, ice cream, doughnuts, Hershey bars and beer. Given the iconic status of the jazz junkie, haunted, hunted, driven by deep need, his death, in an armchair in the apartment of his patroness Nica de Koenigswater, is almost abjectly comfy. </p> <p>When producer Dave Batchelor and I set out to create the montage of reefer songs, coke highs and low-down, drag-out heroin nightmares that became BBC Radio 3's The Chant of the Weed, our aim was to be no more than cautiously debunking. In the 1990s, the prevailing archetype of the jazz musician is no longer Nelson Algren's needful junkie with a \"golden arm\" - the figure of Frankie Machine brought to chilling life on screen by Frank Sinatra - but a college-educated boy in a sweater and Timberlands. The female equivalent has also changed: from a sleepy, spangly broad with dead eyes sharing a needle with the guys at the back of the bus (or sneaking off to a truckstop john to inject into her groin so that track marks wouldn't force her to wear long gloves, like Billie Holiday), to a smart, sussed career woman with a cellphone and a gym card. </p> <p>So unfashionable has the association between drugs and jazz become, so casual the assumption that it amounts to a vast racist slur, that one leading jazz journalist, Mike Zwerin of the International Herald Tribune, actually refused to speak to us on the subject; or rather, he agreed to speak in order to say that there was nothing to talk about. </p> <p>To a degree, Zwerin, who played trombone and bass trumpet in the 50s with the likes of Miles Davis (a sometime user) and Eric Dolphy (almost puritanically clean), has a valid point. Seeing drugs - to stick for the moment to that awkwardly dismissive shorthand - as the underlying explanation for all jazz biography is nonsense. He points to the case of saxophonist Wardell Gray, murdered in what has always been assumed to be a drug-related incident, but which now seems to have been otherwise motivated. </p> <p>However, even once corrections of that sort have been registered, there is still a story to tell, and it is one that somewhat surprised us. Easy to assume that, in keeping with the public assumption, a few giggly puffs of a Thai stick at the start of the story gives way to cramped and aching horror at the end, as dope runs out on the street. Easy also to think that for most musicians use of both hallucinogens and narcotics was done - Aldous Huxley-fashion - as a way of opening up doors of expression that might otherwise have remained shut. Easy, too, to blame poor Charlie Parker for turning a whole generation on to the mantra: high is cool, straight is square. </p> <p>The bulk of our story was inevitably focused on America, but it was a British - indeed Scottish - musician who brought into focus some of the more pointed realities of narcotics use within jazz. Saxophonist Bobby Wellins used to do a tongue-in-cheek guided tour of Brighton which he called \"Bobby's Bogs\", a round-up of the public conveniences where he used to shoot up, relatively secure from prosecution in the knowledge that if not he, then his friend and drummer Phil Seamen, was a registered addict. </p> <p>In 1965, Wellins performed one of the most achingly beautiful solos ever executed on a tenor saxophone, Starless and Bible Black on Stan Tracey's Under Milk Wood suite. Full of air and light, it was played, as he now admits, under the influence of \"all sorts of narcotics\", and yet, for Wellins, there was no intrinsic connection between drug-taking and what or how he played. Diamorphine was a response not to creative agonies, but to the straitened tedium of eking out a living as a jazz player, and to the recognition that he was never going to be a world-ranking player, like Parker or Coltrane. </p> <p>Wellins was also warned off drugs by the older players, much as Charlie Parker, long assumed to be the tubby poster- boy of heroin chic, had reacted furiously when younger players like Jackie McLean and Frank Morgan had copied not just his bebop chops but also his habit. </p> <p>Jazz historian Dan Morgenstern was adamant that Parker could not be held responsible and that the saxophonist's famous collapse during the recording of Lover Man, a moment almost voyeuristically lingered over in Clint Eastwood's biopic Bird, had nothing to do with heroin; Parker had demonstrated an unflagging ability to play at the highest level while high. </p> <p>The facts about heroin use (which inevitably seems the test case in this story) are still muddied. Though there was no register of addicts in America, heroin was not illegal till 1937 and was, routinely, cheaper than brandy and often more readily available. The ironic impact of prohibition - America drank more and turned to drugs - was compounded in the war years when opiates became a basic component of field-dressing packs. When freely and safely available, heroin use seemed surprisingly non-problematic. Vibraphonist Gary Burton, not a user himself, told us that he had worked with many and that the majority managed their habits very well indeed. </p> <p>Burton also hinted at something that is perhaps even more central to the story. The real motor of drug use in jazz isn't availability or economic location. From the earliest times, drug use was a mark of separateness, a refusal to conform to white middle-class norms. Don Redman's The Chant of the Weed could be adopted by mainstream conductor Andre Kostelanetz in the unquestioning belief that it referred unproblematically to tobacco. And how the boys in the back of the bus must have laughed at the straights who thought that Mary Jane, just in from the country, was a kissing cousin. </p> <p>Louis Armstrong, who seemed to come closer to Uncle Tomming than any other great figure of the music, used \"muggles\" and \"tea\" and references to both as a way of showing his fellow-musicians that he hadn't been bought out by Whitey; Pops's entourage even included a guy whose sole duty was to find the local supplier. </p> <p>The white clarinettist Mezz Mezzrow, the nearest thing ever to Norman Mailer's \"White Negro\", inveigled his way on to the stand with infinitely better players simply because he was always holding the best dope. Later on, in the bebop era, heroin was part of the freemasonry of musical separatism; almost nobody would speak of it as an aid to expression; it was a social and then a political act. </p> <p>Making the programmes was a valuable exercise in scepticism as well as a warning against overhasty moralising. After Charlie Parker, there were to be new poster boys, most convincingly Chet Baker. Chet could have modelled for Saks or taken over from James Dean had he not played the trumpet, which he continued to do long after a gang of dealers kicked his teeth out for non-payment. He carried on, in fact, right up to the moment when he fell to his death from an Amsterdam hotel. In later years, Chet played almost every night all over Europe for one reason and one reason only: to score a fix. And yet the music he made, often with bands that scarcely passed muster, was consistently exquisite, documented on almost 175 LPs, tapes and bootlegs from the last eight years. </p> <p> And then at the opposite end of the story, there was John Coltrane, famously supposed to have taken heroin to control agonising dental pain but who then went the now-sanctioned route, got clean and got religion. Looking deeper, it's clear that Trane was subject to the same peer pressures as everyone else but that, far from throwing over drugs entirely, he continued to dabble, and, unusually for a jazz musician, experimented with LSD - an episode that says a lot about the \"spiritual\" foundation of his famous long-form improvisations. </p> <p>The story Dave and I uncovered was at worst tragicomic and often joyous. Looking in from the outside, it's easy to overemphasise the casualty figures and the exploitative dimensions of the story. Looking somewhat from within - and we spent many hours reading and re-reading the unghosted testimony of musicians themselves - it becomes clear that drugs and jazz are intertwined, but that the nature of the connection is as complex as the pharmocology. The \"chant of the weed\" is full of dissonances and codes, but it's also a celebration, of music and of life. </p> <p>\u0095 The Chant of the Weed continues on BBC Radio 3 today at 6pm, and concludes on Saturday March 25.</p>",

When he completed The Planets in 1917 the existence of the ninth planet, Pluto, hadn't been confirmed (it was eventually proved in 1930, four years before Holst's death) and so his orchestral suite consists of seven movements; he omitted Earth because it didn't fit into his astrological view of things. But on Thursday the news was announced that Pluto is going to be put into orbit. The conductor Kent Nagano and the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra have persuaded Colin Matthews to write a movement that boldly goes where no composer has gone before; his music, Pluto the Renewer, will be premiered after a performance of Holst's score is performed in Manchester in May. Apparently Nagano originally wanted Matthews to write an Earth movement too, but the composer refused, on the grounds that it wasn't a \"planet\" in the Holstian sense of the word. </p> <p>Matthews hasn't written pastiche, but a piece in his own style (very fast apparently, taking solar winds as its starting point). What he has done, then, is not a straight completion of the kind that litters musical history from Mozart's Requiem (completed by S\u00fcssmayer) through Puccini's Turandot (with its closing scene by Alfano), Mahler's 10th Symphony (fleshed out by Deryck Cooke, assisted by Colin Matthews and his brother David) and Berg's Lulu (the third act orchestrated by Friedrich Cerha) right up to the present day and Anthony Payne's deservedly acclaimed \"elaboration\" (his word) of the sketches that Elgar left for his Third Symphony, which was first performed two years ago. This Pluto is closer to the work that Busoni based upon Bach's Art of Fugue, the massive Fantasia Contrapuntistica for two pianos, which carries on from where Bach left off in the middle of the culminating fugue, or to Alexander Goehr's opera Arianna, which recycles the libretto for Monteverdi's lost opera of the same name. </p> <p>But the possibilities for other composers are endless. No doubt John Tavener would be only too pleased to add a Resurrection to Richard Strauss's symphonic poem Death and Transfiguration, James MacMillan could add a Second Coming to Mahler's Second Symphony, and Frederick Stocken could write Mendelssohn's Sixth Symphony and we'd never know the difference, while opera houses would no doubt fall over each other to commission John Adams to provide his own Nixon in China with a Watergate sequel. </p> <p>It is opera that provides the most fertile ground for that kind of fantasy. We know what happened to Cherubino after the events of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro because Massenet tells us in Ch\u00e9rubin, just as Rossini's Barber of Seville reveals how Rosina had got to marry Count Almaviva in the first place. But there are all sorts of loose ends in Cosi Fan Tutte which need to be neatly tied together - did those two nice girls really end up with those ghastly laddish men, and did Don Alfonso finally get off with Despina? (I doubt that somehow.) And wouldn't it be nice to know if Parsifal lived happily ever after as king of the grail knights, and whether Rudolfo found another girl of his dreams after Mimi's death in La Boh\u00e8me? (Probably the next day, I should think.) </p> <p>The idea that works of art are fixed in their own, self-contained worlds is obviously in need of a thorough, postmodern overhaul. Pierre Boulez may have spent his career as a composer repeatedly recomposing what he has written before, but little did he realise that he could turn someone else's music into a \"work in progress\" rather than confining himself to his own pieces. Matthews's extension to The Planets, may be a one off - he is too discriminating and self-aware a composer to treat this commission as anything other than a challenge on strictly musical grounds - but for less scrupulous composers and concert promoters short of a novelty it could be the way to gain themselves a few extra column inches.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Beshrew me if the price of pumpkins has not risen yet again!\" The speaker was a tall, gaunt figure clad in the robes of a senior prelate. His aquiline nose betrayed a certain fastidiousness which his sexual proclivities...</p> <p><strong> A doctor writes </strong> : I deprecate these observations. Over the past few months, my surgery has been inundated with patients asking to be beshrewed. I blame the media, for its ceaseless harping on the topic of dysmorphophobia. Yet medical textbooks give no hint as to how this operation can be conducted. Tales about pumpkins are hardly a practical substitute.</p> <p><strong> Smallweed accommodatingly responds </strong> : I am only too happy to help. Whatever your patients think, the word beshrewed has nothing to do with turning into a shrew, or even into a termagant (the sense in which shrew is used in that somewhat unfortunate play by Shakespeare). Its primary meaning is to make wicked, evil or depraved, though that is not what Chaucer's summoner means when he declares: \"I beshrew me but if I tell tales two or three of friars.\" Beshrew in this context means curse. The summoner is saying: may I be cursed if I fail to fulfil my promise. Likewise the line in Othello: \"Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong for the whole world.\" </p> <p><strong> A philologist writes </strong> : The answer to all these problems is to abandon the word beshrew, which is causing all these appalling problems, and readopt its ancient alternative - beshronk. </p> <p> Very well: let us start again. \"Beshronk me if the price of pumpkins has not risen yet again!\". The speaker was a tall, gaunt figure, clad in the robes of a senior prelate. His aquiline nose... </p> <p><strong> A Seeker for Truth (Crewkerne) writes </strong> : Was the prelate perchance wearing a chasuble? </p> <p><strong> Smallweed guardedly replies: </strong> Perhaps. You remind me, however, that, in the matter of chasubles, Martin Loft of Totley passes on a tale of John Buchan's about a candidate for a staunchly protestant constituency who addressed an election rally with the words: \"Men of Kilklavers, will you endure to see a chasuble erected in your market place? Will you see your daughters sold into simony? Will you see celibacy openly practised in your streets?\" To which the audience replied with a thunderous: \"Never!\" </p> <p>\u0095 I went this week to see the film version of Graham Greene's The End of the Affair, in which Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore are mercilessly pursued by God, heavy rain, and the music of Michael Nyman through 1940s London. I found the rain excessive. London is rainy from time to time, to be sure, but it's hardly Bengal in monsoon. One feels one is being exploited.

      "bodyText": "Beshrew me if the price of pumpkins has not risen yet again!\" The speaker was a tall, gaunt figure clad in the robes of a senior prelate. His aquiline nose betrayed a certain fastidiousness which his sexual proclivities... A doctor writes : I deprecate these observations. Over the past few months, my surgery has been inundated with patients asking to be beshrewed. I blame the media, for its ceaseless harping on the topic of dysmorphophobia. Yet medical textbooks give no hint as to how this operation can be conducted. Tales about pumpkins are hardly a practical substitute. Smallweed accommodatingly responds : I am only too happy to help. Whatever your patients think, the word beshrewed has nothing to do with turning into a shrew, or even into a termagant (the sense in which shrew is used in that somewhat unfortunate play by Shakespeare). Its primary meaning is to make wicked, evil or depraved, though that is not what Chaucer's summoner means when he declares: \"I beshrew me but if I tell tales two or three of friars.\" Beshrew in this context means curse. The summoner is saying: may I be cursed if I fail to fulfil my promise. Likewise the line in Othello: \"Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong for the whole world.\" A philologist writes : The answer to all these problems is to abandon the word beshrew, which is causing all these appalling problems, and readopt its ancient alternative - beshronk. Very well: let us start again. \"Beshronk me if the price of pumpkins has not risen yet again!\". The speaker was a tall, gaunt figure, clad in the robes of a senior prelate. His aquiline nose... A Seeker for Truth (Crewkerne) writes : Was the prelate perchance wearing a chasuble? Smallweed guardedly replies: Perhaps. You remind me, however, that, in the matter of chasubles, Martin Loft of Totley passes on a tale of John Buchan's about a candidate for a staunchly protestant constituency who addressed an election rally with the words: \"Men of Kilklavers, will you endure to see a chasuble erected in your market place? Will you see your daughters sold into simony? Will you see celibacy openly practised in your streets?\" To which the audience replied with a thunderous: \"Never!\" \u0095 I went this week to see the film version of Graham Greene's The End of the Affair, in which Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore are mercilessly pursued by God, heavy rain, and the music of Michael Nyman through 1940s London. I found the rain excessive. London is rainy from time to time, to be sure, but it's hardly Bengal in monsoon. One feels one is being exploited. On this charge, however, the writer-director, Neil Jordan, can claim some mandate from Greene. The opening scene in which Fiennes bumps into the husband whom he has cuckolded is specifically set on a black, wet January night in 1946. Bad weather also accompanies other encounters. \"It was very hot today and it dripped with rain\" Greene's heroine records in her diary for October 2, 1945. \"I couldn't stand the house tonight, so I walked in the rain,\" says her very next entry. \"It was a worse night than the one when I met Henry a month before,\" the hero assures us a few pages later. \"This time it was sleet instead of rain: it was halfway to snow and the edged drops seemed to slash their way in through the buttonholes of one's raincoat.\" In the matter of Nyman's music, however, Jordan has no defence.

      "body": "<p><strong> January 6, 2000</strong> <br> I always knew that Cuckoos would be different; just how different was demonstrated by a phone call I had from the well-known agent of a well-known actress. \"My client has read your play and is passing.\" (Agents love the power words of Hollywood.) \"I am sorry to hear that,\" I replied. \"And what's more, there is a message for you,\" continued the disapproving voice. \"She doesn't wish to talk about it.\" I understood. </p> <p> <strong> January 15</strong> <br> Cuckoos is very funny, but also, I hope, curiously shocking. Actresses obviously require strong nerves even to read it. Frankly, I don't know a play of such outrageous delicacy. Although it questions the barriers of taste (as theatre always must, if it is to stay alive) it remains amazingly elegant. That is what intrigued me some three years ago when I first read the play. Colin Teevan, the young dramatist, gave it to me then, and if I could have stayed at the Old Vic, I would have done it on one of the new play Sunday nights. </p> <p>The play is in a vigorous tradition. From the Greeks on, theatre has always flirted with the shocking, the fantastic, the politically inadmissible or even the plain horrible. Sex and violence are not modern inventions and the censor has always watched them with his gimlet eyes. Theatre audiences - rather like tabloid newspaper readers - have always loved to be outraged. To balance dangerously on the edge of rejection excites an audience. </p> <p> <strong> January 17</strong> <br> So is Cuckoos censorable? It certainly would have been 40 years ago. Our censor, the lord chamberlain, employed a staff of retired army and naval officers to read plays. Their chief attribute was that they had extraordinarily dirty minds: they were indeed adept at finding filth where none was intended. Well, it is intended here. They must be spinning in their graves. </p> <p>I hated the lord chamberlain during my early years. Where was the land of free speech? Not Britain, certainly. I did the first British production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Tennessee Williams's poetic anguish was banned because he was bold enough to say that homosexuality might possibly exist. In my RSC days, Samuel Beckett's line \"God, the bastard - he doesn't exist\" was removed because the lord chamberlain decreed that the theatre was not permitted to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Almighty. It is therefore with a feeling of great pleasure that I direct a highly original play that starts as a comedy about anal sex under a parachute. </p> <p> <strong> February 3</strong> <br> As I sat in the tiny auditorium of the Gate this morning I was thinking that it is a miracle such a place exists. Stephen Daldry is the most prominent character, but many other great talents have flowered there and then moved on. I also like the thought that Cuckoos has to my certain knowledge been turned down by every new-play producing stage in London. It is not that they don't like it; they daren't do it. The Gate and its director, Mick Gordon, have dared. </p> <p>Cuckoos is part of a collaboration between the Gate and the National Theatre Studio. So the actors get paid a pittance for rehearsal and nothing whatsoever for performances. This is typically British. The Gate, one of our most cutting-edge theatres, pays no wages because it hasn't any money. Indeed, people are always telling me that its lack of money gives it freedom. Rubbish. I am sure that our narrow-minded masters of culture are delighted at the existence of the Gate because the British still believe it is terribly good for artists to suffer. It isn't. Actors, alone among highly skilled professionals, are content to work for nothing if they believe in the work. </p> <p> <strong> February 15</strong> <br> After a big search and many refusals, I am thrilled to have landed Kelly Hunter to play the woman. She has developed amazingly and is able to touch comedy and tragedy with equal facility. More to the point, when she came to see me about Cuckoos, she spent 20 minutes enthusing about the play and analysing its precision. She never once asked about how we were to effect the actions under the parachute, or how \"real\" the events were going to be. She just accepted what the play required. The two men in the play have been much easier to cast. My old colleague David Yelland and the young actor Paul Ready were my first choices and accepted very quickly. </p> <p> <strong> February 18</strong> <br> Giuseppe Manfridi was born in Rome in 1956. His work has been constantly produced on the Italian stage for 15 years. Cuckoos is the first of his plays to be presented in Britain. He is an original, but very much part of the ancient commedia tradition, with De Filippo and Dario Fo as his forebears. </p> <p>Manfridi calls his theatre - with tongue in cheek - the theatre of excess. Thus the theatre of cruelty and the theatre of the absurd are sent packing. His work pushes our suspension of disbelief to the limit. There is a plain ordinariness about his incredible stories that allows the audience still to believe. One of the most tawdry phrases in the theatre is \"We can get away with it\", when applied to an inadequate piece of business, or a creaky turn of plot. Manfridi never gets away with it; he confronts it. And out of this is born riotous excess. </p> <p>Teevan translates Manfridi into English, and Manfridi translates Teevan into Italian. Both dramatists have a love of letting extreme events loose in bourgeois drawing-rooms. It is as if we set up a perfectly ordinary room so that within it Titus Andronicus can cut his hand off, Gloucester can have his eyes pressed into a vile jelly and Howard Brenton's Romans can bugger the British. Who says metaphorical images in the theatre are dead? </p> <p> <strong> February 21</strong> <br> First day's rehearsal. This is always the worst day in a director's life. It is the day when you know your cast is right or wrong; even worse, it is the day when you know if you have misjudged the play and it is no bloody good. You then face six or seven weeks of rising above it, of looking cheerful and trying to help a group of people who know only too well that disaster is slowly approaching them. </p> <p>Nothing like that today, thank heavens. The play comes up off the page with clarity and wit. And as I suspected, it is remarkably timed and structured. The story is played out with the expertise of a thriller writer. </p> <p>Manfridi told me that in the early stages of the play, the Italian audience were so amazed by the premise that they sat there with their mouths hanging open and hardly made a sound. Within 15 minutes, they had forgotten the extraordinariness of what they were watching and laughed. Audiences will believe anything providing it is credible. And they will forget anything, providing their attention is frankly engaged. I once saw a production of Don Giovanni in Paris that for some reason had two white horses tethered at the back of the stage, their bottoms towards us. They chewed hay and stamped, as horses do, and did the other necessary things that horses do. After each of these interruptions, the audience quickly forgot about them and went back to Mozart and Da Ponte. I never did discover the point of the horses. They were never referred to or touched by anybody. </p> <p> <strong> February 28</strong> <br> I had been worried about all the technical problems. Since the two actors are under the parachute for almost the entire play, how would they be visible, how would they mask their nakedness, and indeed how would they be able to move at all? Lucy Hall, my designer, bought a real parachute from an army surplus store for \u00a335. We spread it in the rehearsal room and it all worked like a dream. It is strange and beautiful - and also functional. Theatre is exactly like life in that it is always the things you worry about most that end up hurting you least. </p> <p> <strong> March 13</strong> <br> First full run-through. I did something unusual and dangerous - I asked a score of assorted friends to experience our first attempt. They were as surprised as the actors. The play requires techniques akin to acting Pinter. The actors have to control the audience, and allow them to laugh at certain points so that they can hit them with something painful at others. The learning process of provoking then denying laughter takes time. And it is time we don't possess, because there are only three previews. Hence the presence of the audience. </p> <p>They laughed immediately and well. For 20 minutes the play fizzed along. Then it died and the laughter died with it. Why? The actors relaxed a little after their first tension, and although the playing was still confident, it appeared to grow introverted and serious, and so no longer con trolled the audience. That extra 10% of energy was missing. Consequently, the audience obliged by stopping their laughter. They thought we wanted the fun to be over. In truth, the characters of this play must remain volatile - I mean Latin - and the situation is ridiculously intense, right up to the horror of the last 10 minutes. We can only go serious once. I have a week to completely refocus the play. I knew there was something wrong. I even knew what it was. But I needed it to be confirmed. Only an audience could do that. </p> <p><strong>'Have you ever - you know...' a scene from Cuckoos</strong></p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> You know, I would have thought that if you had even the slightest inkling that this might happen you could have informed me. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> Firstly, I did not think there was even the tiniest possibility of this happening. And secondly, it was you gave me the green light. </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> Amber at the most. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> It certainly wasn't red. </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> Remind me never to catch a ride with you. Again. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> From behind, you said. Not much ambiguity in that. It was almost an order. </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> That has many interpretations. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> Like what, for instance? </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> This is neither the time nor the place. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> Means only one thing in my book. </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> You should read more widely. </p> <p> He shudders and wipes the sweat from his brow. </p> <p>You're shaking. Why are you shaking? You're at it again. Stop it. Stop it, I said! </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> Ahh! </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> You've got unlimited resources. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> He might, but I don't. </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> I suppose, in a certain light, it could be seen as flattering. <br><strong> Tito:</strong> You know, it's my first time, like this, I mean. (Pause.) Have you ever - you know - before? </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> (Reluctantly.) Only the once. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> Once now or once before? </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> Once before! Once before! </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> Then you should know what to do. </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> It was a long time ago. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> How long? </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> When I was young. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> You're still young. </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> Forget it, sonny. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> Honest. (Pause.) So how was it for you? Then, I mean. </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> It was beautiful. </p> <p><strong> Tito:</strong> How did it end? </p> <p><strong> Beatrice:</strong> It ended, at least. We emerged, looking at the stars and went our separate ways. </p> <p>\u0095 Cuckoos opens on Friday at the Gate Theatre, London W11 (0171-229 5387). Cuckoos by Giuseppe Manfridi, English version by Colin Teevan, is published on Friday by Oberon Books at \u00a36.99.</p>",

'Have you ever - you know...' a scene from Cuckoos Beatrice: You know, I would have thought that if you had even the slightest inkling that this might happen you could have informed me. Tito: Firstly, I did not think there was even the tiniest possibility of this happening. And secondly, it was you gave me the green light. Beatrice: Amber at the most. Tito: It certainly wasn't red. Beatrice: Remind me never to catch a ride with you. Again. Tito: From behind, you said. Not much ambiguity in that. It was almost an order. Beatrice: That has many interpretations. Tito: Like what, for instance? Beatrice: This is neither the time nor the place. Tito: Means only one thing in my book. Beatrice: You should read more widely. He shudders and wipes the sweat from his brow. You're shaking. Why are you shaking? You're at it again. Stop it. Stop it, I said! Tito: Ahh! Beatrice: You've got unlimited resources. Tito: He might, but I don't. Beatrice: I suppose, in a certain light, it could be seen as flattering. Tito: You know, it's my first time, like this, I mean. (Pause.) Have you ever - you know - before? Beatrice: (Reluctantly.) Only the once. Tito: Once now or once before? Beatrice: Once before! Once before! Tito: Then you should know what to do. Beatrice: It was a long time ago. Tito: How long? Beatrice: When I was young. Tito: You're still young. Beatrice: Forget it, sonny. Tito: Honest. (Pause.) So how was it for you? Then, I mean. Beatrice: It was beautiful. Tito: How did it end? Beatrice: It ended, at least. We emerged, looking at the stars and went our separate ways. \u0095 Cuckoos opens on Friday at the Gate Theatre, London W11 (0171-229 5387). Cuckoos by Giuseppe Manfridi, English version by Colin Teevan, is published on Friday by Oberon Books at \u00a36.99.",

      "body": "<p> A candid confession from Britain's most successful astrologer, Jonathan Cainer. Writing in the increasingly eccentric Daily Express, he said this week: \"Wherever possible, astrologers avoid making specific predictions about particular events. We find it a lot safer to be vague. This allows us to claim credit when it suits us - and it gets us off the hook if we have misread a horoscope... Out of respect to tradition, I always make a point of speaking in riddles or of burying my very best prophecies in a set of casual, seemingly off-hand remarks.\" </p> <p>In other words, he hasn't a clue what's going to happen, and even if he did get it right, you wouldn't understand it. For instance, his advice to me and my fellow Geminis this week included: \"Time is an end in itself. Or rather, experience is.\" Amazing what the stars foretell, isn't it? Actually, I find Mr Cainer's honesty refreshing. He reminds me of the Punch cartoon captioned: \"In a major breakthrough for the science of astrology, all people born under the sign of Scorpio were yesterday run over by egg lorries.\" </p> <p>The clue to Mr Cainer's success comes below his quote: \"Calls to Jonathan's Zodiac line cost 60p a minute... for a full personal horoscope, send \u00a321.99.\" Apparently this is a huge business, earning money that would make Ken Livingstone blush. I shall make a fortune with my own personal Destiny Line at \u00a31.20 a minute. Callers will hear a recorded message saying: \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Now, get a bleeding life.\" </p> <p>\u0095 My other money-spinner comes from an idea by my friend Dr Mark Garnett. It's for non-computer nerds, and it's called: toolate.com. Log on and it will be explained to you how you now have no chance of making a penny on the internet, and will also have to go on paying full price for airline tickets, hotel rooms, books and DVDs. This is such a useful service it should hit the stock market valued at least \u00a310m, for a week at least, before it collapses to 37p. </p> <p> \u0095 I spent many happy hours of my youth on Stalybridge station, and this handsome postcard of the buffet, sent in by David Hoult, brings back memories. I don't know which is more appealing: the town crier announcing last orders as the Stockport Flier thunders through, or that tasty-looking pork pie. Several readers have written about the curious culinary practices of the north-west. Apparently my flippant tone about the closure of Poole's Pies in Wigan was resented: \"You can have no idea how delicious they were. </p> <p>The drivers of Glasgow trains would hold them in Wigan station while the guard nipped out for a stack of pies,\" one ex-Wiganite tells me. Following my item about the chip pie, Dean Hawkes, now of Cambridge but raised in Rochdale, says that during the war he had a neighbour called Rosie who once told him that for her tea she'd had a cream cracker sandwich. \"I made the obvious assumption that this would be two cream crackers with something between them, but she explained that it was two slices of bread with the cream cracker as filling. 'Grand,' she said. Wigan can't be allowed to have all the glory.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Last week I mentioned Jeffrey Archer's remarkable diary in the Spectator. Something niggled me about it, then I woke up in the middle of the night and remembered what it was. The diary continued right up to Thursday March 9, even though the Spectator's deadline is Tuesday and the last minute anything can be squeezed in is 3pm on Wednesday afternoon. Yet we find Archer discussing the US primary results on Wednesday morning (inaccurately, as it turns out), describing how he wrote 2,000 words in the course of the day, and \"in the evening [ie hours after the Spectator was printed] we join the Thatchers for dinner at the Ritz. I have no intention of repeating anything that was said on this occasion, but I suspect you can guess Denis Thatcher's views on Steve Norris's policy for gays.\" </p> <p>If you read that very carefully, you'll see that nothing in it is an outright lie. The two halves of the last sentence could be taken separately and would both be accurate. Bearded this week by a colleague, Archer admitted that he had indeed written up this event before it took place. \"But I steered the conversation round to Steve Norris and gays so as to make it true,\" he claimed. What a bizarre notion of truth he has, to be sure! But I suspect the whole thing was really there to show that the Thatchers still break bread with him, so yah-boo to the rest of us. </p> <p> \u0095 Still on Lady Thatcher, there is sad news from the University of Buckingham, the freelance college which is her favourite seat of learning. For months they have planned a massive conference entitled \"The Thatcher Years\". Any anxieties about whether the participants would come down in favour of those years can be laid to rest by the subtitle: \"The Rebirth of Liberty\". </p> <p>Speakers listed include John Redwood, Bernard Ingham, Baroness Young and visitors from various rightwing planets, such as Patrick Minford and Lord Harris of High Cross, who looks like a less rational version of Professor Branestawm. Plus a few less enthusiastic fans, such as Lord Howe and our own Hugo Young. </p> <p>At a fee of \u00a3460 per head, plus VAT, plus accommodation, for the two-day conference, tickets should be a snip for all those people made rich and prosperous by Lady Thatcher's enlightened policies. But, sadly, not enough of them, for the conference has had to be cancelled due to lack of interest. </p> <p>\u0095 More rightwingers of varying degrees of looniness, including Mr Redwood, the Hamiltons, and the ineffable Sir Alfred Sherman, attended the launch at Politico's bookshop this week of Blowing The Whistle, the book about corruption in the EU by the Dutch civil servant Paul van Buitenen. I always feel uneasy rubbing shoulders with such people, and the book itself is rather curiously written. There's a little more than is strictly necessary about the way his travails led the author to his Christian faith. </p> <p>That said, if just a quarter of what he describes is true, then the EU is wasting our money at an unimaginable rate. The cronyism, the blackmail, the sweetheart contracts, the manner in which several commissioners ran their departments as gravy trains for their friends and compatriots. People who complained that the rules were being broken were threatened with the sack. The main investigatory body was hamstrung by the fact that before it began an inquiry, it had to have not a suspicion, but proof that misconduct had occurred. And we needn't get too complacent about crooked foreigners, either; one of van Buitenen's main villains is a middle-ranking British official whose friends were for a while very fortunate indeed. </p> <p>Some years ago I was visiting the European parliament, and a group of Labour MEPs asked me to join them for dinner. We swept up to one of the finest restaurants in Strasbourg and tucked into a superlative meal, spoiled for me only by the fear that the paper would be unwilling to pay my share of such a monstrous bill. When it arrived, I pulled out my credit card, and can still remember the look of sheer, HM Bateman, \"the man who\"-style incredulity that greeted my gesture. \"My dear fellow, you are the guest of the socialist group!\" said one of the MEPs, as you might explain the use of an escargot fork to an Amazon Indian. </p> <p>\u0095 Alastair Campbell has been complaining this week about the press giving a negative image of politicians by their constant carping. It's a good point. I remember clearly how Alastair, anxious to support democracy, always wanted to put everything in the best possible light before the 1997 election. \"Look,\" he'd say, \"be fair. Crime may have doubled over the past 18 years, but it's showing a marked decrease this year, and we have to give the Tories credit for that.\" Or when we prepared another \"Tories split on Europe\" article, he'd be the first to say, \"There really are two sides to this story, and it says a lot for the Conservatives that they're prepared to give everyone a shout.\" How different from the cold, cynical, aggressive reportage we see today.</p>",

Mr Smeath, a close associate of Jeremy Fraser, Mr Dobson's campaign manager, admitted that he had persuaded the postgraduate student John Jones, \"albeit reluctantly\", to sign and send the complaint to Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, in December. Mr Smeath's admission came less than 24 hours after Mr Jones had issued a statement through Loughborough University, claiming: \"None of this is anything to do with me.\" Mr Smeath, a lawyer, is a campaign organiser for the Labour party in Southwark, south London, and has been arranging canvassing for the mayoral elections to win support for Mr Dobson and Labour candidates for the Greater London authority.

Mr Dobson's spokeswoman conceded that Mr Smeath's decision to ask someone else to sign his complaint was \"maybe a silly thing to do\" in the light of his links with Mr Fraser and the Labour party.

Later a specialist adviser to the Commons education committee, he was well known for his work on education in prisons.</p> <p>Tackling literacy skills and the poor English of many immigrants were priorities at Ilea; there were no teaching qualifications in these specialisations, yet the demand for teachers was growing steadily, and there was increasing concern about illiteracy among school-leavers and adults. With the Royal Society of Arts (RSA), Heaven developed diplomas in the teaching of literacy skills and of English as a second language to adults.</p> <p>He was also chairman of the RSA committee for English as a foreign language for 20 years, which gave him a worldwide influence on the standards of teaching English.

      "bodyText": "During lectures to adult educationists, one warm-up technique used by Sidney Heaven, who has died aged 83, was to stand on his head in silence, then comment that \"the first lesson of education is never to ask your group to do something you can't do yourself.\" Heaven had a major influence on the teaching of English as a foreign language, and was from 1963-82 inspector for further and higher education for the Inner London Education Authority. Later a specialist adviser to the Commons education committee, he was well known for his work on education in prisons. Tackling literacy skills and the poor English of many immigrants were priorities at Ilea; there were no teaching qualifications in these specialisations, yet the demand for teachers was growing steadily, and there was increasing concern about illiteracy among school-leavers and adults. With the Royal Society of Arts (RSA), Heaven developed diplomas in the teaching of literacy skills and of English as a second language to adults. He was also chairman of the RSA committee for English as a foreign language for 20 years, which gave him a worldwide influence on the standards of teaching English. He took pride in the wide range of Ilea evening courses and got enormous pleasure from inspecting classes in subjects such as pigeon fancying and \"sea cookery\". Heaven went everywhere in London on his hand-built racing cycle, usually chaining it up in the principal's car park space of the college he was visiting. Equally distinctive was his habit of hanging wet swimming trunks in his County Hall office. He was a charismatic teacher, who made full use of his striking appearance and athletic prowess.

In 1946, when he became an English lecturer at the College of St Mark and St John, Chelsea, he sported a maroon-coloured corduroy jacket, bow tie and monocle. His dog, Ahab, a boxer with something of the same cast of features, preceded him into college every day, and sat in on his tutorials. Heaven became the first director of studies for London university's diploma in the teaching of English, and in this period also researched and edited a series of early plays, including The Puritaine (1607), at one time falsely attributed to Shakespeare, and Sir Richard Steele's comedy The Funeral (1701).

At their meeting in Karlsruhe, members are expected to decide on measures that will oblige the government to set a 30-year deadline for an end to nuclear power in Germany, a move certain to prompt a showdown with the country's powerful atomic energy industry. The conference is taking place in the shadow of an arms export question which threatens to provoke a serious conflict between the Greens and their Social Democrat coalition partners. There have been leaks in the media about a request from the Turkish government to buy more than 1,000 Leopard tanks from Germany, and about discussions in Berlin over the possible sale of 40 Fuchs armoured cars to the United Arab Emirates. \"Moral values and the standards of democracy and human rights are being cast to the wind,\" Winfried Hermann, a Green MP, warned yesterday. \"The Greens will do everything to stop this.\" The party's \"realist\" wing will try to ditch some of the ideological baggage inherited from the Greens' early years as an \"alternative\" political movement, including a ban on Green party leaders becoming members of parliament or holding other senior political positions. But the reform of this rule is hotly opposed by the grassroots \"fundamentalist\" wing of the party which fears that it could expose the Greens to charges that is open to corruption, following the scandal involving Christian Democrats and their former leader, ex-chancellor Helmut Kohl. The party's preoccupation with internal Green politics, at the expense of national issues, is seen as one of the main reasons for the popularity crisis. \"The issues that will win us back voters are on the street, they are unemployment, the environment and globalisation,\" said Germany's Green environment minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin. \"But the Greens only seem to be interested in themselves,\" he added.

According to an opinion poll published this week, 67% of the electorate regard the Greens as a \"superfluous organisation.\" Particularly galling is the decline in young voters who once made up the party's bedrock of support. \"The Greens are the people who get up at five in the morning to grind up their breakfast muesli,\" was one of the responses given to the party's chief spokesman, Antje Radke, by a German high school student this week.

Now she stands on the verge of becoming one of the most influential leftwing political figures in South America as run-away leader in the polls for mayor of Sao Paulo, the continent's largest city and Brazil's economic powerhouse. Ms Suplicy, a member of the Workers' party (PT), stands out in this conservative, Catholic country with a history of campaigning on controversial issues such as gay marriage and legalising abortion. She has succeeded in keeping traditional working class support as well as reaching out to new voters. Blonde, combative and articulate from her days as a TV sexologist, Ms Suplicy is a challenge to the old political order. \"She represents a new phase for the Workers' party,\" said David Fleischer, professor of politics at Brasilia university. \"The PT is moving from being hardline and radical to a very, very light socialism, bordering on social democracy.

This will propel her nationally into the political elite and and has the potential to make her the most likely leftwing candidate for president in 2006. In the latest polls, Ms Suplicy leads the rightwing opposition - which is facing corruption scandals - by 17 percentage points. Ms Suplicy - who is married to a PT senator - believes that her gender has a lot to do with her success. \"I am a woman and people are very disillusioned with men.

A fifth member of the group, Kozo Okamoto, who is accused of participating in the 1972 killing of 24 people at the main airport in Tel Aviv, was granted asylum in Lebanon. An official statement said he was being allowed to stay for health reasons, but it appeared more likely he was being allowed to stay because he has hero's status among some in the Arab world for his role in the airport massacre. The others - three men and a woman - were put on a flight to Amman where they were handed over to Japanese diplomats at the airport and flown home. Last week, all five finished three-year prison terms for illegally entering Lebanon, but they had remained in custody until the Beirut government figured out what to do with them. Kozo Okamoto, 51, had been freed by Israel in a 1985 prisoner swap with Palestinian rebels. The Red Army was a shadowy ultra-leftist group that operating in the 1970s.

      "bodyText": "Two of the City's best known bankers quit yesterday - the casualties of the recent round of consolidation in the banking sector. Richard Delbridge, the highly respected finance director at NatWest, and Michael Dobson, a main board director of Deutsche Bank and head of its asset management business, will be leaving their jobs in the coming weeks. The departure of Mr Delbridge, who joined NatWest as finance director five years ago, was the first big announcement by the Royal Bank of Scotland since it won control of NatWest last month. His departure came as a surprise to some City bank watchers. Royal Bank had been expected to attempt to keep Mr Delbridge to ease the amalgamation of the two banks. He is to be replaced by current RBS Finance and Risk Director, 49-year-old Grahame Whitehead. At Deutsche Bank there was no official explanation for the departure of Michael Dobson, but it is understood he had opposed the bank's decision last week to merge with rival Dresdner Bank. Mr Dobson, who was educated at Eton, was previously chief executive of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, as the bank's investment banking unit was known, having been with Morgan Grenfell since before Deutsche bought the British merchant bank in 1989. He will be replaced by Sir Robert Smith, currently vice-chairman of the asset management business, who will not be on the main bank board.",

Internet firms join forces Lastminute.com and 365 Corporation yesterday signed content deals with cable group NTL and search engine Yahoo that will significantly boost their customer reach. The alliances give Lastminute.com and 365 Corporation important distribution agreements, while NTL and Yahoo benefit from the expansion of their content offerings. NTL will provide Lastminute.com with about 1.8m pay-TV customers who have internet access, while 365 Corporation will supply Yahoo with a varied offering of football, rugby, cricket, motor sport and horseracing. The rugby and football will be offered in English, French and Spanish. Qualcomm settles lawsuit Qualcomm said yesterday it had reached agreement to resolve the class-action litigation filed by former employees of the company arising from the sale of assets of its infrastructure division to Ericsson. Under the terms of the settlement, $8.9m (\u00a35.6m) will be distributed to more than 1,000 former employees covered by the lawsuit. Qualcomm, while agreeing to resolve the lawsuit, paid nothing toward the settlement, with all payments to be made by third parties. The affected employees have until April 17 to opt out of the settlement and Qualcomm has the option to cancel the settlement if more than a designated number of affected employees opt out. A final settlement approval hearing has been scheduled for April 28. Scoot boss raises stake Scoot.com, the online directory, said its chief executive, Robert Bonnier, bought 400,000 shares in the company at 268p each. The purchase increases Mr Bonnier's holding in Scoot to 46.5m shares - 8.32% of the total.",

I have eaten them at the Lindsay House cooked by Richard Corrigan, at the Blue Print Cafe cooked by Jeremy Lee, at St John's cooked by Fergus Henderson, at Moro cooked by Sam and Sam Clark, and at The Orrery cooked by Chris Galvin, to name but a few of London's most discerning chefs in porcine matters. </p> <p>There was a time when Britain was awash with pig varieties (Berkshire, Cumberland, Gloucester Old Spot, Large White, Middle White, Small White, Lincolnshire Curly Coat, Tamworth, English Lop, etc), for each of which there was a specialist purpose. The Lincolnshire Curly Coat, say, gave Lincolnshire sausages their distinctive flavour as, once, the Cumberland did to the Cumberland sausage. Gloucester Old Spot, \"the pig with the built-in apple sauce\", was a 19th-century favourite, for roasting, naturally. The Berkshire/Tamworth cross was the bacon pig of the 1800s. </p> <p>But that was all in the high days of British farmers. Today, most of British farming is in a pretty parlous state, and pig farming is in a more parlous state than the rest. Global competition, an insistence on price over quality, and higher standards of animal husbandry have spelled disaster for our pig farmers. </p> <p>All of which makes Vaughan's project to rescue the Middle White all the more interesting. Vaughans have been farming their particular patch of the sylvan Wye valley, Huntsham Court Farm, for more than 600 years. Until 15 years ago, Richard was one of our largest suppliers of beef for the supermarket trade, buying, fattening and sending calves off for slaughter, as many and as cheaply and as quickly as possible. Then the bottom fell out of the market, so, encouraged by his now ex-wife, he switched to rare breeds and, for a while, opened the farm to the public. Today, Vaughan focuses on just three traditional breeds: Long Horn cattle, a magnificent tawny animal with shy black eyes and sweeping horns the length of a sabre; Ryeland sheep, \"the sweet meat of Herefordshire\"; and the Middle White pig, with its distinctive snub nose and short, chubby body. </p> <p>Middle Whites may have originated from a cross between the now extinct Small White and an imported Chinese pig, which would explain the retrouss\u00e9 nose. It was a hugely popular porker until the last war, since when commercial tastes and the absurd demand for lean meat - absurd because 65% of flavour is carried through the intramuscular fat in meat, so no fat equals no flavour - resulted in its slide from grace. Now, there are only about 250 breeding sows in the country, and Vaughan has 40 of them. </p> <p>And very happy they look, too, snuggling and snuffling around in the clean straw in their pens, segregated by age and sex. Not being hardy creatures, they stay indoors until the weather perks up, when they are released into the fields and woods behind the farm to scavenge for natural supplements to their diet. They live this agreeable, unstressed life, growing at their natural rate on their natural food, for 18 weeks, when they are ready for the chop. The chop takes place at a small, family-run abattoir five miles away, so that they have minimum travel and minimum stress. The carcasses are returned to the farm for hanging in a chiller cabin for 10 days, and then handed over to a local butcher, who divvies them up into the neat joints demanded by chefs and the 400-plus private clients who order Vaughan's superlative pork (Pedigree Meats of Hereford at Huntsham Court Farm, 01600 890296). </p> <p>Of course, there is a trade-off on price - there always is if you demand quality. Buy half a pig from Vaughan (he deals only in halves, ready butchered into shoulders, legs, fillet chops and sausages), and it'll cost you \u00a380 plus \u00a317 delivery. As half a pig weighs in at 16-18kg (don't worry, it freezes well, and you can always share the load with a group of friends), that works out to \u00a35.40-\u00a36.10 per kilo, which is an absurdly small premium for such sweetness of flavour, such supreme succulence, such pluperfect crackling.</p>",

      "body": "<p>All recipes serve six. </p> <p><strong> Leg of pork with artichokes and onions </strong></p> <p> This feeds more than six, but the leftovers are fantastic. </p> <p><strong> 8-10 small to medium-sized onions </strong></p> <p><strong>4 bayleaves </strong></p> <p><strong>1 small sprig thyme </strong></p> <p><strong>1 leg of top-quality pork (this will weigh, and cost, a lot, so go for leg, if need be, changing cooking times accordingly) </strong></p> <p><strong>1 small sprig rosemary </strong></p> <p><strong>Olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong>Sea salt and black peppercorns </strong></p> <p><strong>10-20 baby artichokes </strong></p> <p><strong>Juice of 1 lemon</strong> </p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 230C/450F/gas mark 8. Peel the onions, taking care to leave the base root intact (cut away any threads still attached to it), then cut them into four or six pieces right through the core. Lay the onions in a roasting tray that is big enough to accommodate them all, crammed with olive oil. Bury three of the bayleaves within the onions, and lay the thyme on top. Lay on the joint, rub it with a little olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Do not score the skin. Place in the oven, cook for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 160C/325F/gas mark 3, and cook for 25 minutes per 500g of meat. Once the cooking time has elapsed, switch off the oven, and leave the meat to rest for at least 45 minutes. </p> <p>While the pork is cooking, squeeze the lemon juice into a wide bowl and add a teaspoon of sea salt. Trim the artichokes of their outer leaves, and cut them back until the greater part of the fibrous outer parts has been removed, revealing the tender stalk and head. One by one, toss each prepared artichoke briefly in lemon juice (too much lemon kills their subtle flavour), then place in a pot. Add to the pot a few tablespoons of olive oil, a bayleaf, a couple of black peppercorns and enough water to cover. If the artichokes bob to the surface, place a plate on top, to act as a weight. Place the pot over a high heat, bring to the boil, then simmer until tender. </p> <p>Fifteen minutes before serv ing, take the pork out of the pan and place on a board. Strain the artichokes, cut each in half lengthways and add to the pan. Pick the leaves from the rosemary, toss in sea salt and pepper, and scatter over the top of the vegetables in the pan. Remove as much fat from the pan as is possible without breaking up the onions, and return to the oven until the artichokes and onions have browned at the edges. </p> <p><strong> Rillettes</strong></p> <p> This is Jane Grigson's recipe for Rillettes de Paris, from her book on the glory of the pig, Charcuterie And French Pork Cookery. The point is the prolonged, gentle cooking, so that the meat is in the most melting condition possible.</p> <p><strong> 500g pork belly </strong></p> <p><strong>30g good lard </strong></p> <p><strong>12g sea salt </strong></p> <p><strong>Black pepper </strong></p> <p><strong>1 bayleaf</strong> </p> <p>Cut the meat into 2.5cm-long pieces. In a heavy pan and over a very, very low flame, fry the pork in the lard, stirring repeatedly, until the meat is pale gold all over. Pour off the fat, add the bayleaf, and cook, uncovered, for five hours on the lowest possible heat (Grigson recommends care and attention: 'Too high a flame will fry the pieces of meat and harden them', so do as she says). From time to time, pour in a little water to prevent the meat sticking. Switch off the heat, and leave the pot to cook completely. </p> <p>Next, either finely chop the meat in a blender, or chop and pound it by hand, until you have a smooth, unctuous pt\u00e9. Season with salt and pepper, and add as much of the drained fat as you want - it all depends on personal taste, but I use quite a lot of it.</p> <p><strong>Crackling</strong> </p> <p> The first point must obviously be the quality of the pork: at the very least, only free-range should be considered. There is a very old and very good tradition of soaking the joint first in a brine containing vinegar, sugar and spices, but modern problems of storage and time come into play, so I don't expect many would want even to try it. Anyway, a good butcher will be more than happy to brine the meat for you. On no account score the skin. For the best crackling, rub the joint all over with olive oil and sea salt, followed by a slow roast - long cooking renders all the excess fat, and delivers up a deeply bronzed and crisp crackling. The timing and temperature given in the recipe for leg of pork apply to all joints of pork. </p> <p><strong>Sausages</strong></p> <p> The British banger is a true duffer when put beside those of Italy, France or Spain, but there is no reason why our standards should not rival them.</p> <p><strong> 750g lean pork </strong></p> <p><strong>250g pork fat (back fat or flair) </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp black peppercorns, cracked in a mill or mortar and pestle </strong></p> <p><strong>Sea salt </strong></p> <p><strong>1 pinch freshly-grated nutmeg </strong></p> <p><strong>50g sausage casings, 2.2m in total length (from good butcher shops)</strong> </p> <p>Work the lean and the fat meat together through the coarse blade of a mincer (ask the butcher to do this for you), then add the pepper, salt and nutmeg, along with any other spices or seasonings that take your fancy (don't go overboard the first time). Work the mix to ensure an even blend, then leave covered in the fridge for 24 to 36 hours to mature. </p> <p>When ready to make the sausages, rinse the skins well - leave for at least a couple of hours under running cold water. The traditional method of filling the skins - that is, putting a wide nozzle on a piping bag and then pushing the casing up over the nozzle - is very slow, as the air has to be pushed out of the sausage as you go along. However, unless you have a sausage stuffer handy, or your butcher is of the obliging variety, then very slow it is going to have to be. At least it's easy work. Twist the ends to seal, then tie each sausage, until you have a string of sausages. Refrigerate for at least three hours before cooking, preferably overnight - they will dry slightly and so cook better. </p> <p><strong>Twice-cooked pork</strong></p> <p>Christine Yau, the proprietor of Ming, in Soho, gave me the method for this most pleasing dish.</p> <p><strong> 1 pork belly weighing 1.5kg </strong></p> <p><strong>2 stems dry and pickled vegetables (try a Chinese supermarket) or two big pieces fresh ginger and 1 bunch spring onions, roughly chopped </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp dark soy sauce </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp oyster sauce</strong> </p> <p>Fill a pot with enough water later to cover the meat and bring to a rolling boil. Plunge the pork into the water, return to the boil and leave for a minute or two, to remove any impurities. Place the pot in a sink, and run cold water into it until the water inside runs clear. </p> <p>Remove the meat, clean the pot, then return the pork to it, along with the vegetables, sauces and a litre of cold water. Simmer, covered, for an hour-and-a-half, every now and then lifting up the meat to stop it sticking to the base, then turn the pork over and cook slowly for another hour or so. Remove from the pot and leave to rest for 15 minutes. Remove the bones: first, loosen them with the point of a knife, then pull free. Slice the meat very thinly, place on a serving dish, and ladle over the sauce </p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is the chef at Blue Print Cafe, London SE1</p>",

Place the pot over a high heat, bring to the boil, then simmer until tender. Fifteen minutes before serv ing, take the pork out of the pan and place on a board. Strain the artichokes, cut each in half lengthways and add to the pan. Pick the leaves from the rosemary, toss in sea salt and pepper, and scatter over the top of the vegetables in the pan. Remove as much fat from the pan as is possible without breaking up the onions, and return to the oven until the artichokes and onions have browned at the edges. Rillettes This is Jane Grigson's recipe for Rillettes de Paris, from her book on the glory of the pig, Charcuterie And French Pork Cookery. The point is the prolonged, gentle cooking, so that the meat is in the most melting condition possible. 500g pork belly 30g good lard 12g sea salt Black pepper 1 bayleaf Cut the meat into 2.5cm-long pieces. In a heavy pan and over a very, very low flame, fry the pork in the lard, stirring repeatedly, until the meat is pale gold all over. Pour off the fat, add the bayleaf, and cook, uncovered, for five hours on the lowest possible heat (Grigson recommends care and attention: 'Too high a flame will fry the pieces of meat and harden them', so do as she says). From time to time, pour in a little water to prevent the meat sticking. Switch off the heat, and leave the pot to cook completely. Next, either finely chop the meat in a blender, or chop and pound it by hand, until you have a smooth, unctuous pt\u00e9. Season with salt and pepper, and add as much of the drained fat as you want - it all depends on personal taste, but I use quite a lot of it. Crackling The first point must obviously be the quality of the pork: at the very least, only free-range should be considered. There is a very old and very good tradition of soaking the joint first in a brine containing vinegar, sugar and spices, but modern problems of storage and time come into play, so I don't expect many would want even to try it. Anyway, a good butcher will be more than happy to brine the meat for you. On no account score the skin. For the best crackling, rub the joint all over with olive oil and sea salt, followed by a slow roast - long cooking renders all the excess fat, and delivers up a deeply bronzed and crisp crackling. The timing and temperature given in the recipe for leg of pork apply to all joints of pork. Sausages The British banger is a true duffer when put beside those of Italy, France or Spain, but there is no reason why our standards should not rival them. 750g lean pork 250g pork fat (back fat or flair) 1 tsp black peppercorns, cracked in a mill or mortar and pestle Sea salt 1 pinch freshly-grated nutmeg 50g sausage casings, 2.2m in total length (from good butcher shops) Work the lean and the fat meat together through the coarse blade of a mincer (ask the butcher to do this for you), then add the pepper, salt and nutmeg, along with any other spices or seasonings that take your fancy (don't go overboard the first time). Work the mix to ensure an even blend, then leave covered in the fridge for 24 to 36 hours to mature. When ready to make the sausages, rinse the skins well - leave for at least a couple of hours under running cold water. The traditional method of filling the skins - that is, putting a wide nozzle on a piping bag and then pushing the casing up over the nozzle - is very slow, as the air has to be pushed out of the sausage as you go along. However, unless you have a sausage stuffer handy, or your butcher is of the obliging variety, then very slow it is going to have to be. At least it's easy work. Twist the ends to seal, then tie each sausage, until you have a string of sausages. Refrigerate for at least three hours before cooking, preferably overnight - they will dry slightly and so cook better. Twice-cooked pork Christine Yau, the proprietor of Ming, in Soho, gave me the method for this most pleasing dish. 1 pork belly weighing 1.5kg 2 stems dry and pickled vegetables (try a Chinese supermarket) or two big pieces fresh ginger and 1 bunch spring onions, roughly chopped 2 tbsp dark soy sauce 2 tbsp oyster sauce Fill a pot with enough water later to cover the meat and bring to a rolling boil. Plunge the pork into the water, return to the boil and leave for a minute or two, to remove any impurities. Place the pot in a sink, and run cold water into it until the water inside runs clear. Remove the meat, clean the pot, then return the pork to it, along with the vegetables, sauces and a litre of cold water. Simmer, covered, for an hour-and-a-half, every now and then lifting up the meat to stop it sticking to the base, then turn the pork over and cook slowly for another hour or so. Remove from the pot and leave to rest for 15 minutes. Remove the bones: first, loosen them with the point of a knife, then pull free. Slice the meat very thinly, place on a serving dish, and ladle over the sauce \u0095 Jeremy Lee is the chef at Blue Print Cafe, London SE1",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is Saturday afternoon, a slow day in Ann Widdecombe's constituency surgery. There's a child support case; someone with a gripe against taxes on caravans; somebody else wants to talk about asylum-seekers. The Tory MP for Maidstone and the Weald listens, head cocked slightly, like a curious budgerigar. There are custard creams on the table. After each constituent leaves she picks up her Dictaphone and composes an instant letter, thanking them for coming to see her and outlining her response to their predicament. </p> <p>She looks almost petite in a short-sleeved, navy blue woollen dress which smooths her bulky contours, exposing arms that are surprisingly elegant. Her outfits are rarely so flattering. William Hague smiles down from the wall in a pre make-over photograph like a fond godson. </p> <p>Ann Widdecombe, 52, has a reputation built on extremes. To some she is Doris Karloff, possibly the most unpopular woman in Britain after being wrongly associated with shackling women prisoners in labour or childbirth when she was prisons minister in 1996; to others she is a national heroine after singlehandedly terminating Michael Howard's political career in a sublime moment of oratorical brilliance. </p> <p>Since the Tories' crushing 1997 defeat, she has become the most prominent politician on the shadow front bench. A staunch right-winger, Widdecombe has powerful popular appeal and talks to people in a way they understand (pandering, some say, to their baser instincts with her outbursts on asylum seekers, for example). She's unreconstructed, someone who won't give herself up to the image consultants and spindoctors; we may not like all her views, but at least she's got some. But others regard her as a weird anachronism, someone out of step with the spirit of the age; whose unshakeable faith, moralistic views and narrow perspective on life belong to a different era; a politician who shines when compared to her opposition colleagues. </p> <p>Today she's not shining. In fact, she looks a little jaded. After surgery she takes the Guardian shopping at a little country boutique called Lady Mop to choose a blouse for her mother. Then back home in her bungalow in the Kent village of Sutton Valence (her main home is now in London) she puts in a wash, takes a seat on the granny-style settee and tucks her tiny feet under her. A fire is laid in the grate, an empty scotch bottle is in the kitchen. </p> <p>She is unfailingly polite and helpful. She rarely shies away from publicity - \"a bit too showbizzy\" one colleague says. The only media show she refuses to take part in is Have I Got News For You. (\"I've never yet seen a politician beat the regulars. They always come off worst. My wit's not fast enough.\") But after years of personal and vicious attacks she is keen to get over her human side and doesn't think there's anything wrong with that. </p> <p>A few weeks ago in Good Housekeeping magazine she talked about giving up her career to look after her mother if the need arose. She even shared her \"beauty routine\" with readers: she washes her hair with Vosene every other day and likes to be \"dressed with perfume\", preferably Miss Dior or Chanel No 5. Then there's the cats' diary she's writing for the Daily Mail, looking at the daily lives of her two cats, Carruthers and Pugwash, and her bookings for Call My Bluff. All this against the backdrop of continuing murmurings about the future leadership of the Tories. </p> <p>Widdecombe dismisses any suggestion that she might one day lead the party. \"Oh yeah, I mean - come on!\" she says, mock-irritated. \"There's this myth that we always solve our problems by changing our leader. We don't. I do get rather tired of the speculation about who the next leader is going to be. For all I know it may not be for another couple of decades and I shall have long gone to prune my roses on Dartmoor.\" </p> <p>Michael Portillo's early return following his confessions about his gay past will inevitably steal some of her limelight. She is, she insists loyally, delighted he's back as shadow chancellor to add weight to the team. Many however are convinced she would - and should - throw her hat into the ring, were there a leadership contest. \"She's obviously after being leader,\" says Labour maverick Frank Field, who got to know her on the social security select committee. \"Many people think she's a conviction politician who sees everything in black and white. If you listen to her carefully she doesn't, and that's her cleverness. She's much more subtle than most people think.\" </p> <p>Peter Luff, her former private parliamentary secretary, now opposition whip for home affairs, agrees: \"She's represented as a right-wing harridan, but her views are a lot more sophisticated than that. Her speech to the party conference last year sounded very rightwing, but when you look at what she said about prison policy, she's very liberal.\" </p> <p>Perhaps that subtlety, which has largely escaped public notice, will become more apparent with the publication next month of her first novel, The Clematis Tree, for which she was paid \u00a3100,000 as part of a two-book deal. It is an ethical tale which explores euthanasia, right-to-life, and our attitudes to the disabled. No surprises there, from a woman whose pro-life, anti-abortion stance is as much part of her identity as her pudding-basin haircut and her headmistressy tones. </p> <p>What is more striking perhaps is the joylessness of this book. In the space of fewer than 300 pages, a four-year-old boy is paralysed and severely brain-damaged after being hit by a speeding sportscar; four children are killed in a coach crash; we hear of another car crash which kills three (a child who survives dies of cancer two years later); someone has a heart attack, then a stroke, then dies; and the same brain-damaged boy dies in dubious circumstances after the brake on his wheelchair fails and he falls headlong into a stream. And there's more. \"Mother thought it was quite miserable,\" Widdecombe admits. </p> <p>Mother is right. Widdecombe's vision of life in this book is cruel and unforgiving. \"None of it is autobiographical,\" she insists. \"Everybody will be trying to analyse it in great depth and detail, but it's not a tract for my views. It's a genuine attempt at a novel. I've always wanted to write a novel. I've got about seven or eight ideas in my head. This was the one I pulled out first.\" </p> <p>The Clematis Tree may not be straightforwardly autobiographical, but it focuses on issues which are at the core of Widdecombe's beliefs. One senior editor allegedly turned it down because, though reasonably well written, she found it preachy and propagandist. It is heavy on duty, responsibility and endurance, the central tenets of Widdecombe's personal philosophy. Her next subject sounds lighthearted by comparison - set in second world war France, it's about a na\u00efve young convent girl who falls in love with a married German officer. </p> <p>Ann Noreen Widdecombe was born in 1947 in Bath where her father, Murray, a Cornishman, worked in what was then called the admiralty, and his wife Rita was a full-time mother. Anne's brother, Malcolm, was older by 10 years (they were pre-war, post-war babies) and they lived with their grandmother, who had been bombed out of her home in Plymouth. When Widdecombe was five, her father was posted to Singapore. Her brother and grandmother had to be left behind: the first so as not to disrupt school, the second because the doctor ruled her unfit for the three-week crossing. </p> <p>In Singapore her parents lived in a social whirl while their daughter attended the royal navy school, became very good at swimming and played with her nanny's daughter, Moi, in a garden full of banana trees and bamboos. (It was in Moi's house that she did much of the work on her novel in the summer of 1998). </p> <p>Three years later they returned to England, and lived in a succession of homes in Bath and the south-east, moving each time her father had a new posting. He became director general of naval supplies and transport. Her mother moved 24 times in her 62-year marriage. Her most recent move has been into her daughter's new London home following the death of her husband last year. </p> <p>She is, says her daughter, unfailingly soft and gentle. \"She's still sorry for absolutely everybody,\" says Widdecombe. \"Anybody!\" she adds incredulously. \"She'll say things like 'poor Mr Blair' if he's had a rough time. I say, 'Nonsense, it's not poor Mr Blair at all'.\" Journalists rarely meet her. She doesn't like all the hurtful things that have been written about her daughter. When the Guardian photographer arrived at Widdecombe's London home, her mother was seen disappearing into the upstairs gloom on the recently installed Stannah lift, Widdecombe Jr shouting instructions after her. </p> <p>Malcolm Widdecombe believes his sister is more like their father than their mother. \"Dad was irascible. He was absolutely fair, straight and honest, and totally committed to his job. Ann is totally committed to what she does. My dad was always a just person, but he was tough. I don't think he was warm. He was not an emotional type.\" </p> <p>Writer Lucy Gannon was a contemporary at La Sainte Union, the Bath convent where Widdecombe went as a day-girl when she was 11 and later as a boarder. She was one of a minority of protestants in a Catholic school, which taught her to stand up for herself very early. \"She has turned out just as I would have imagined,\" says Gannon. \"She was very earnest and had a very clear idea of right and wrong which coincided with the nuns' views. I don't think she ever had a moment's self doubt. But I had a friend who was a boarder and whenever my friend was unhappy, the one person who would be unfailingly kind and considerate was Ann.\" </p> <p>She was house captain, senior prefect, she debated for the school and founded the classical society. She tried to get into Oxford to do law, but was turned down after interview and went instead to Birmingham, where she studied Latin (after early ambitions to be a missionary, she wanted to become a Latin teacher). She joined the university's Christian Union and became interested in the evangelist Billy Graham, whose preaching was a key influence on Widdecombe's own distinctive style of speaking. </p> <p>It was at Birmingham that her ambition to become an MP crystallised. She enjoyed debating, winning arguments - all part of the politicians' armour - and is by instinct combative, adversarial, a bare-knuckle fighter with tiny doll hands, and pearly polished nails. She lavishes an extraordinary amount of attention on her nails - they're always painted, apart from a four-week break she gives them during the summer to recover. </p> <p>Her passion for politics comes from a sense of duty, public service and concern for society, but there's an egotism about it too. She likes the sheer challenge of the thing. \"If you ask me what is most fascinating about politics,\" she says, \"it is trying to solve insoluble problems.\" </p> <p>So, while her peers at Birmingham were planning careers as social workers, teachers and probation staff, Widdecombe decided, with her 2:1 and her parents' financial support, to go to Oxford to study politics, philosophy and economics. She got a third - among her greatest achievements she claims, because she did so little work. More importantly, she threw her energies into the Oxford Union, the debating society, where she became secretary and treasurer. \"She was quite frightening even then,\" remembers the writer Libby Purves. \"She didn't have the attractive personality that gets made president of the union. She was a pretty, petite little thing but always rather dour. Even then she wasn't somebody you had a giggle with in the bar. There was that feeling even then that she knew she was right.\" </p> <p>At Oxford she found romantic love for the first and last time with Colin Maltby, now a banker. They are pictured together in one memorable snap - him in a dinner suit, her somehow shockingly glamorous with dark, tumbling hair, a hint of cleavage, and sexy, wide black choker - more Nigella Lawson than Doris Karloff. </p> <p>\"When I was younger of course I liked to look glamorous,\" she says. \"I wasn't a slave to it, but I certainly did follow fashion at Oxford. I loved my long hair - I had hair half way down my back. When you're young you have these wonderful fantasies about looking marvellous, spending fortunes on lipsticks and other such frippery and then I think you settle down to looking presentable.\" </p> <p>The love affair ended after three years. It just fizzled out, she says. Widdecombe left Oxford and embarked on an unhappy career marketing Persil and Comfort for Unilever. At some point she cut her long hair and politics began to take over. There was, some say, a new ferocity about her. Edwina Currie, a near contemporary at Oxford, is quoted saying: \"Something min eral entered her bloodstream and something animal left it. Some steel came over her. One doesn't know if there was one specific disastrous incident - something that put her off sex - or whether it's just a general distaste that grew.\" </p> <p>Widdecombe is contemptuous. Edwina couldn't possibly know, they weren't even at Oxford at the same time! She does not share the general amusement at the glorious symmetry of these two women: both office holders in the Oxford Union, both senior Tory MPs, both novelists - one writing about sex, the other about euthanasia. (There is, for the record, one very chaste sexual encounter between a married couple in Widdecombe's novel.) </p> <p>After Unilever, she spent 12 years working in finance at London University, devoting every second of her spare time to furthering her political career. In 1977 she was selected as the Tory candidate for Burnley, and in the 1979 general election halved the Labour majority. In 1983 she lost Devonport to David Owen and in 1985 was selected for Maidstone and the Weald, finally being elected to parliament two years later. </p> <p>She had achieved her goal through bloody-minded determination. (Widdecombe astonished local party workers in Burnley by travelling up to Lancashire every weekend for two years, charging fearlessly into working men's clubs and demanding their vote.) \"I don't think she's brilliant,\" says one Oxford contemporary. \"She's always been a bloody hard worker. It's the beta-plus slog. She's never had that little spark of brilliance that makes everybody in the room smile.\" </p> <p>In parliament it was her passionately held views on abortion which first put her in the public eye - in 1987 she joined supporters of David Alton's abortion bill - and it is probably the one issue which defines and upsets her more than any other. All visitors to her cramped, uncomfortable Westminster office are confronted with three fading, but still vividly bloody anti abortion posters. She can't pinpoint exactly where and how her views were shaped - she remembers being horrified by the 1967 act and debated against it at Birmingham and lost. Three years later she debated against it again at Oxford and won. She denies being out of step with general opinion. \"Every time we do an opinion poll on abortion, you actually get a consensus in favour of tightening the law.\" </p> <p>But Widdecombe's faith and moral convictions do seem to belong to a different era. She's a Joan of Arc figure - battle imagery litters her language - who stands in opposition to the modern tendency to define ourselves by our faults and uncertainties. \"I think a lot of people these days suspect certainty, are slightly nervous in the presence of strong conviction. Whereas a few centuries ago, the opposite would have been true,\" she says. She did briefly lose her faith once - \"the slow erosion of belief\". Otherwise she seems utterly unshakeable. </p> <p>She believes in capital punishment as a deterrent; opposes any reduction in the age of homosexual consent; believes in marriage as the foundation of society; thinks divorce is too easy and believes mothers should stay at home and raise their children. Particularly for modern women it's a frightening, immoveable agenda. But somehow, maybe because of her oddity and the fascination with her appearance, her personal moral and religious views are not given a great deal of serious consideration. Widdecombe herself puts them to one side saying they are the subject of free votes only. But it's interesting to consider what a world run along Widdecombe lines might be like. It's not exactly the Taliban, but it would certainly turn the clock back a few decades. </p> <p>She is a conundrum for feminists. As a strong, independent, successful woman she deserves admiration, but so much of what she represents seems to be anti-woman. She admits she prefers the company of men: women are too emotionally demanding. </p> <p>Her views have not held her back in her career. In John Major's government, she was appointed parliamentary under secretary of state in the social security department with special responsibility for pensions; she was moved to employment in 1993 where she worked with Portillo; and from there went to the home office where she was responsible for immigration and prisons. (She made a point of visiting all 131 prisons in England and Wales in her own time at weekends, sometimes four a day.) </p> <p>Her media profile was raised even further by her very public conversion from the Church of England to Catholicism over the issue of women priests. Dressed in her pious Sunday best, she was on the front of almost every newspaper the day she was accepted into the Catholic church. Some grumbled it was tacky making public what should have been a private matter of personal faith. She says she never expected such a media circus: \"But I had a statement to make. I would not have done it in a broom cupboard.\" </p> <p>There was evidently little love lost between her and Michael Howard, then home secretary and her boss. The common perception was that he allowed her to take a lot of the flak. Frank Field again: \"She was used as a fall guy.\" Then, in 1997, her fortunes changed with that single phrase describing Howard: \"something of the night about him\". His career was over, Widdecombe's had been resurrected. Howard last week said of Widdecombe: \"She was effective, she was competent, she did the right things. She obviously disagreed with me about my decision to dismiss Derek Lewis [director general of the prison service - sacked over a breakout from Parkhurst Prison]. I still think that decision was right. I did not expect her to react in the way she did.\" </p> <p>For a time Widdecombe thought her political career was over. She prepared herself for a quiet time on the backbenches and began to write her book. But a year later Hague asked her to become shadow health secretary. She brought the 1998 Tory party conference to its feet with a rousing speech in classic Widdecombe style - some jokes, no notes, and a touch of pantomime. Last year he moved her to her first love, home affairs, as shadow home secretary and she is clearly relishing being boss of her own team. </p> <p>\"She's in the top echelon of the party,\" says close friend and ally David Amess MP. \"She had huge influence on our common sense policies and much of what she believes in is now bearing fruit. The party is being drawn towards her. She's one of the four or five people who have got a big influence over the way we are developing policy. She has accepted being in opposition much more adeptly than many other conservative politicians. Do I think she's going to become leader of the conservative party? There's no vacancy. Do I think she has the qualities of a leader? Most definitely, yes.\" </p> <p>Others disagree - vehemently. \"She won't ever be leader. There's something missing in her,\" one says. \"I don't think a zealous Catholic virgin is what the party or the country want. If you look at the wider picture of where the Tories are, someone holding Widdecombe's views is part of the problem, not part of the answer.\" </p> <p>She is however extraordinarily popular with the Tory rank and file and spends her time dashing to speaking engagements around the country, rousing the troops and raising her own profile. She's famously kind-hearted: there are stories about her quietly buying cups of tea and sandwiches for the homeless away from the media spotlight; she adores babies and very young children and is a popular godmother. </p> <p>Peter Luff says she is much more sensitive than people realise. \"She's also quite vulnerable to criticism. There's a softer side to her. She appreciates reassurance. She likes to be told she's done well.\" She can also be funny and is good at telling stories at her own expense. (even if she does sometimes tell the same gags again and again). </p> <p>Gyles Brandreth, writing in Breaking The Code, an account of his time as an MP, recalls her telling his constituents about her first election campaign, in the run-up to which she had published a pamphlet called Christian Principles. She was doing an open air meeting and had set up her soap box in the market square when she remembered she had left her pamphlets in the boot of her agent's car. She was seen running down Maidstone High Street shouting: \"Stop, stop! I've lost my Christian Principles.\" </p> <p>It's a curious mixture of being kind and yet unforgiving; concerned and yet not compassionate. (She hates the word. \"Compassion has become a buzz word.\") When she talks about travelling in India, it's with distaste at the beggars. There's no apparent sympathy or imagination about their plight. She worked as a Samaritan for two years, taking calls at the dead of night from people in the depths of despair. \"It's a much abused service,\" she says. \"Some people used it as a kind of self-indulgence.\" One can imagine her telling them to pull themselves together, stop whingeing and get on with it. </p> <p>Carpe diem, seize the day, is her catchphrase which is repeated ad nauseam. Which would of course be her approach should her political career fall about her ears. She looks ahead to a retirement in the West Country, with animals, and gusty walks across bleak wide open spaces. And of course, there's always the novel writing to fall back on. </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong> Ann Noreen Widdecombe</strong> <strong> Born:</strong> Bath, October 4 1947 </p> <p><strong>Education: </strong>La Sainte Union Convent, Bath; University of Birmingham; Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford (BA Hons, MA). </p> <p><strong> Employment:</strong> Marketing at Unilever 1973-5; senior administra tor, University of London 1975-87. </p> <p><strong> Political career:</strong> Tory MP for Maidstone and The Weald1987-; parliamentary under secretary of state in the department for social security with special responsibility for employment 1993; home office minister with responsibility for the prison service and immigration 1995-97; shadow health secretary May 1998; shadow home secretary1999-. <strong> Publications:</strong> Layman's Guide To Defence 1984; Inspired &amp; Outspoken: The Collected Speeches of Ann Widdecombe 1999.

      "bodyText": "It is Saturday afternoon, a slow day in Ann Widdecombe's constituency surgery. There's a child support case; someone with a gripe against taxes on caravans; somebody else wants to talk about asylum-seekers. The Tory MP for Maidstone and the Weald listens, head cocked slightly, like a curious budgerigar. There are custard creams on the table. After each constituent leaves she picks up her Dictaphone and composes an instant letter, thanking them for coming to see her and outlining her response to their predicament. She looks almost petite in a short-sleeved, navy blue woollen dress which smooths her bulky contours, exposing arms that are surprisingly elegant. Her outfits are rarely so flattering. William Hague smiles down from the wall in a pre make-over photograph like a fond godson. Ann Widdecombe, 52, has a reputation built on extremes. To some she is Doris Karloff, possibly the most unpopular woman in Britain after being wrongly associated with shackling women prisoners in labour or childbirth when she was prisons minister in 1996; to others she is a national heroine after singlehandedly terminating Michael Howard's political career in a sublime moment of oratorical brilliance. Since the Tories' crushing 1997 defeat, she has become the most prominent politician on the shadow front bench. A staunch right-winger, Widdecombe has powerful popular appeal and talks to people in a way they understand (pandering, some say, to their baser instincts with her outbursts on asylum seekers, for example). She's unreconstructed, someone who won't give herself up to the image consultants and spindoctors; we may not like all her views, but at least she's got some. But others regard her as a weird anachronism, someone out of step with the spirit of the age; whose unshakeable faith, moralistic views and narrow perspective on life belong to a different era; a politician who shines when compared to her opposition colleagues. Today she's not shining. In fact, she looks a little jaded. After surgery she takes the Guardian shopping at a little country boutique called Lady Mop to choose a blouse for her mother. Then back home in her bungalow in the Kent village of Sutton Valence (her main home is now in London) she puts in a wash, takes a seat on the granny-style settee and tucks her tiny feet under her. A fire is laid in the grate, an empty scotch bottle is in the kitchen. She is unfailingly polite and helpful. She rarely shies away from publicity - \"a bit too showbizzy\" one colleague says. The only media show she refuses to take part in is Have I Got News For You. (\"I've never yet seen a politician beat the regulars. They always come off worst. My wit's not fast enough.\") But after years of personal and vicious attacks she is keen to get over her human side and doesn't think there's anything wrong with that. A few weeks ago in Good Housekeeping magazine she talked about giving up her career to look after her mother if the need arose. She even shared her \"beauty routine\" with readers: she washes her hair with Vosene every other day and likes to be \"dressed with perfume\", preferably Miss Dior or Chanel No 5. Then there's the cats' diary she's writing for the Daily Mail, looking at the daily lives of her two cats, Carruthers and Pugwash, and her bookings for Call My Bluff. All this against the backdrop of continuing murmurings about the future leadership of the Tories. Widdecombe dismisses any suggestion that she might one day lead the party. \"Oh yeah, I mean - come on!\" she says, mock-irritated. \"There's this myth that we always solve our problems by changing our leader. We don't. I do get rather tired of the speculation about who the next leader is going to be. For all I know it may not be for another couple of decades and I shall have long gone to prune my roses on Dartmoor.\" Michael Portillo's early return following his confessions about his gay past will inevitably steal some of her limelight. She is, she insists loyally, delighted he's back as shadow chancellor to add weight to the team. Many however are convinced she would - and should - throw her hat into the ring, were there a leadership contest. \"She's obviously after being leader,\" says Labour maverick Frank Field, who got to know her on the social security select committee. \"Many people think she's a conviction politician who sees everything in black and white. If you listen to her carefully she doesn't, and that's her cleverness. She's much more subtle than most people think.\" Peter Luff, her former private parliamentary secretary, now opposition whip for home affairs, agrees: \"She's represented as a right-wing harridan, but her views are a lot more sophisticated than that. Her speech to the party conference last year sounded very rightwing, but when you look at what she said about prison policy, she's very liberal.\" Perhaps that subtlety, which has largely escaped public notice, will become more apparent with the publication next month of her first novel, The Clematis Tree, for which she was paid \u00a3100,000 as part of a two-book deal. It is an ethical tale which explores euthanasia, right-to-life, and our attitudes to the disabled. No surprises there, from a woman whose pro-life, anti-abortion stance is as much part of her identity as her pudding-basin haircut and her headmistressy tones. What is more striking perhaps is the joylessness of this book. In the space of fewer than 300 pages, a four-year-old boy is paralysed and severely brain-damaged after being hit by a speeding sportscar; four children are killed in a coach crash; we hear of another car crash which kills three (a child who survives dies of cancer two years later); someone has a heart attack, then a stroke, then dies; and the same brain-damaged boy dies in dubious circumstances after the brake on his wheelchair fails and he falls headlong into a stream. And there's more. \"Mother thought it was quite miserable,\" Widdecombe admits. Mother is right. Widdecombe's vision of life in this book is cruel and unforgiving. \"None of it is autobiographical,\" she insists. \"Everybody will be trying to analyse it in great depth and detail, but it's not a tract for my views. It's a genuine attempt at a novel. I've always wanted to write a novel. I've got about seven or eight ideas in my head. This was the one I pulled out first.\" The Clematis Tree may not be straightforwardly autobiographical, but it focuses on issues which are at the core of Widdecombe's beliefs. One senior editor allegedly turned it down because, though reasonably well written, she found it preachy and propagandist. It is heavy on duty, responsibility and endurance, the central tenets of Widdecombe's personal philosophy. Her next subject sounds lighthearted by comparison - set in second world war France, it's about a na\u00efve young convent girl who falls in love with a married German officer. Ann Noreen Widdecombe was born in 1947 in Bath where her father, Murray, a Cornishman, worked in what was then called the admiralty, and his wife Rita was a full-time mother. Anne's brother, Malcolm, was older by 10 years (they were pre-war, post-war babies) and they lived with their grandmother, who had been bombed out of her home in Plymouth. When Widdecombe was five, her father was posted to Singapore. Her brother and grandmother had to be left behind: the first so as not to disrupt school, the second because the doctor ruled her unfit for the three-week crossing. In Singapore her parents lived in a social whirl while their daughter attended the royal navy school, became very good at swimming and played with her nanny's daughter, Moi, in a garden full of banana trees and bamboos. (It was in Moi's house that she did much of the work on her novel in the summer of 1998). Three years later they returned to England, and lived in a succession of homes in Bath and the south-east, moving each time her father had a new posting. He became director general of naval supplies and transport. Her mother moved 24 times in her 62-year marriage. Her most recent move has been into her daughter's new London home following the death of her husband last year. She is, says her daughter, unfailingly soft and gentle. \"She's still sorry for absolutely everybody,\" says Widdecombe. \"Anybody!\" she adds incredulously. \"She'll say things like 'poor Mr Blair' if he's had a rough time. I say, 'Nonsense, it's not poor Mr Blair at all'.\" Journalists rarely meet her. She doesn't like all the hurtful things that have been written about her daughter. When the Guardian photographer arrived at Widdecombe's London home, her mother was seen disappearing into the upstairs gloom on the recently installed Stannah lift, Widdecombe Jr shouting instructions after her. Malcolm Widdecombe believes his sister is more like their father than their mother. \"Dad was irascible. He was absolutely fair, straight and honest, and totally committed to his job. Ann is totally committed to what she does. My dad was always a just person, but he was tough. I don't think he was warm. He was not an emotional type.\" Writer Lucy Gannon was a contemporary at La Sainte Union, the Bath convent where Widdecombe went as a day-girl when she was 11 and later as a boarder. She was one of a minority of protestants in a Catholic school, which taught her to stand up for herself very early. \"She has turned out just as I would have imagined,\" says Gannon. \"She was very earnest and had a very clear idea of right and wrong which coincided with the nuns' views. I don't think she ever had a moment's self doubt. But I had a friend who was a boarder and whenever my friend was unhappy, the one person who would be unfailingly kind and considerate was Ann.\" She was house captain, senior prefect, she debated for the school and founded the classical society. She tried to get into Oxford to do law, but was turned down after interview and went instead to Birmingham, where she studied Latin (after early ambitions to be a missionary, she wanted to become a Latin teacher). She joined the university's Christian Union and became interested in the evangelist Billy Graham, whose preaching was a key influence on Widdecombe's own distinctive style of speaking. It was at Birmingham that her ambition to become an MP crystallised. She enjoyed debating, winning arguments - all part of the politicians' armour - and is by instinct combative, adversarial, a bare-knuckle fighter with tiny doll hands, and pearly polished nails. She lavishes an extraordinary amount of attention on her nails - they're always painted, apart from a four-week break she gives them during the summer to recover. Her passion for politics comes from a sense of duty, public service and concern for society, but there's an egotism about it too. She likes the sheer challenge of the thing. \"If you ask me what is most fascinating about politics,\" she says, \"it is trying to solve insoluble problems.\" So, while her peers at Birmingham were planning careers as social workers, teachers and probation staff, Widdecombe decided, with her 2:1 and her parents' financial support, to go to Oxford to study politics, philosophy and economics. She got a third - among her greatest achievements she claims, because she did so little work. More importantly, she threw her energies into the Oxford Union, the debating society, where she became secretary and treasurer. \"She was quite frightening even then,\" remembers the writer Libby Purves. \"She didn't have the attractive personality that gets made president of the union. She was a pretty, petite little thing but always rather dour. Even then she wasn't somebody you had a giggle with in the bar. There was that feeling even then that she knew she was right.\" At Oxford she found romantic love for the first and last time with Colin Maltby, now a banker. They are pictured together in one memorable snap - him in a dinner suit, her somehow shockingly glamorous with dark, tumbling hair, a hint of cleavage, and sexy, wide black choker - more Nigella Lawson than Doris Karloff. \"When I was younger of course I liked to look glamorous,\" she says. \"I wasn't a slave to it, but I certainly did follow fashion at Oxford. I loved my long hair - I had hair half way down my back. When you're young you have these wonderful fantasies about looking marvellous, spending fortunes on lipsticks and other such frippery and then I think you settle down to looking presentable.\" The love affair ended after three years. It just fizzled out, she says. Widdecombe left Oxford and embarked on an unhappy career marketing Persil and Comfort for Unilever. At some point she cut her long hair and politics began to take over. There was, some say, a new ferocity about her. Edwina Currie, a near contemporary at Oxford, is quoted saying: \"Something min eral entered her bloodstream and something animal left it. Some steel came over her. One doesn't know if there was one specific disastrous incident - something that put her off sex - or whether it's just a general distaste that grew.\" Widdecombe is contemptuous. Edwina couldn't possibly know, they weren't even at Oxford at the same time! She does not share the general amusement at the glorious symmetry of these two women: both office holders in the Oxford Union, both senior Tory MPs, both novelists - one writing about sex, the other about euthanasia. (There is, for the record, one very chaste sexual encounter between a married couple in Widdecombe's novel.) After Unilever, she spent 12 years working in finance at London University, devoting every second of her spare time to furthering her political career. In 1977 she was selected as the Tory candidate for Burnley, and in the 1979 general election halved the Labour majority. In 1983 she lost Devonport to David Owen and in 1985 was selected for Maidstone and the Weald, finally being elected to parliament two years later. She had achieved her goal through bloody-minded determination. (Widdecombe astonished local party workers in Burnley by travelling up to Lancashire every weekend for two years, charging fearlessly into working men's clubs and demanding their vote.) \"I don't think she's brilliant,\" says one Oxford contemporary. \"She's always been a bloody hard worker. It's the beta-plus slog.

She believes in capital punishment as a deterrent; opposes any reduction in the age of homosexual consent; believes in marriage as the foundation of society; thinks divorce is too easy and believes mothers should stay at home and raise their children.

She looks ahead to a retirement in the West Country, with animals, and gusty walks across bleak wide open spaces. And of course, there's always the novel writing to fall back on.

In today's wired-up world it is possible to imagine the \"room\" evaporating but Lloyd's marching on in cyberspace. Lloyd's is not an insurance company, nor even a market place, in the sense of a stock exchange or auction room. </p> <p>It is a name, above all. </p> <p>And while it is on trial in London, the Lloyd's brand is being promoted worldwide in the first concerted advertising campaign in the market's 400-year history.

Results will be assessed in the summer before any further campaigns are undertaken. </p> <p>Various versions of the Lloyd's logo have done the rounds, but the blue lettering with a gold line beneath is being promoted as the \"classic look\". And Lloyd's of London is, the only name of a City institution to have become a Hollywood film title, in the 1936 Tyrone Power production. </p> <p>Elsewhere in American popular culture, the satirist Tom Lehrer sang in the 1960s that, in the event of a nuclear war: \"No one will have the endurance/to collect on his insurance/Lloyd's of London will be loaded when they go.\" </p> <p>Not so much of \"of London\", nowadays, however. Since 1996, the Lloyd's logo has been just that, although the \"of London\" is still used in text. Should the court case go against the market, cynics might conclude that, as with the old circumcision joke, they threw away the wrong bit. </p> <p>What has not changed is the apostrophe, a survivor from the market's origins in Edward Lloyd's coffee house in the City in the late 17th century. Its benefit in terms of distinguishing Lloyd's from the venerable banking house at the sign of the black horse far outweighs the inability ever to use the genitive correctly, short of horrors such as \"Lloyd's's chairman\". </p> <p>In terms of brand values, Lloyd's has hitherto survived on the basis of an unmatched reputation. In contrast to the stock exchange, for example - whose leading lights will cheerfully acknowledge the roguery and backstabbing of centuries past - the Lloyd's name has rested above all else on centuries of trust. </p> <p>Technically, the principle underlying all insurance - uberrima fides - means simply that all parties to the transaction (particularly the insured) must act in \"utmost good faith\" by bringing to the table all relevant information, in contrast to the \"buyer beware\" school of thought. But at Lloyd's it has tended to mean much more. </p> <p>That is why this is a case Lloyd's cannot afford to lose.</p>",

Elsewhere in American popular culture, the satirist Tom Lehrer sang in the 1960s that, in the event of a nuclear war: \"No one will have the endurance/to collect on his insurance/Lloyd's of London will be loaded when they go.\" Not so much of \"of London\", nowadays, however. Since 1996, the Lloyd's logo has been just that, although the \"of London\" is still used in text. Should the court case go against the market, cynics might conclude that, as with the old circumcision joke, they threw away the wrong bit. What has not changed is the apostrophe, a survivor from the market's origins in Edward Lloyd's coffee house in the City in the late 17th century. Its benefit in terms of distinguishing Lloyd's from the venerable banking house at the sign of the black horse far outweighs the inability ever to use the genitive correctly, short of horrors such as \"Lloyd's's chairman\". In terms of brand values, Lloyd's has hitherto survived on the basis of an unmatched reputation. In contrast to the stock exchange, for example - whose leading lights will cheerfully acknowledge the roguery and backstabbing of centuries past - the Lloyd's name has rested above all else on centuries of trust. Technically, the principle underlying all insurance - uberrima fides - means simply that all parties to the transaction (particularly the insured) must act in \"utmost good faith\" by bringing to the table all relevant information, in contrast to the \"buyer beware\" school of thought. But at Lloyd's it has tended to mean much more. That is why this is a case Lloyd's cannot afford to lose.",

He's written his story with a journalist, telling it in the third person. It's usually better to hear such terrifying deeds from the subject who did them rather than, as here, via the polished, newscaster tones of Barry Nolan, a US telly anchorman. Brehm almost dies during his maiden mission when he is accidentally winched down into the funnel of a pitching cargo ship, and his career climaxes with the rescue of the downed pilot of the stealth bomber in Kosovo. Two shameful facts about these men stick in the memory: they are paid a pittance, and only one in a 1,000 rescued civilians contacts them afterwards to say thank you.",

      "body": "<p>In 1948, aged 14, Ernest Gaines left the Louisiana plantation where his family had lived since slavery, to follow his mother and stepfather to California. Family and friends, the only people he had ever known, waved him away from his Aunt Augustine's porch and the moment froze in his memory like a photograph, a picture of a vanished time.</p> <p>His Aunt, a cripple who could only move by crawling like a baby, but who raised him without complaint, died before seeing him again. In his absence, the exhausting manual harvesting of the plantation by its black tenants, only subtly altered in a century, was squashed by mechanisation. The buildings, the life, even the people he had known were erased, as if they had never been. But Ernest Gaines held that last, lost moment close. </p> <p>It was his fourth novel, The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1971), the \"memoirs\" of a tough-minded 110-year-old from slavery to civil rights, later filmed for American TV, that made him loved in the US. A Lesson Before Dying (1993), about bitter black school-teacher Grant Wiggins, longing to leave his Louisiana community in the 40s, held back by an aunt in order to save a Death Row man's soul, is his latest, million-selling book. </p> <p>But it is a scene in his most recent UK publication, A Gathering of Old Men (US, 1983) that defines Gaines's work best. It is set, like all his novels, in Bayonne, his fictional version of his birthplace. A group of elderly black men and women are confronting an ageing white sheriff with old sins at the end of the 70s, refusing to go quietly. They repeat an incantation, \"You don't see what we don't see\"; they stare hard at the places where companions, shacks, lives once were, until they can see them in the empty space - raised, remembered ghosts. </p> <p>Ernest Gaines, who now lives only 50 miles from his heartland, tends its cemetery and walks its grounds, can raise ghosts, too, writing books each summer away in San Francisco. Staring at a blank wall, he recalls the past. He once left for a better life as Grant Wiggins desired to do. But unlike his character, he feels no shame. \"All my writing is about that place, and people like my aunt, so I didn't betray them,\" he says in a Louisiana twang. \"Without them, I would be no writer, because I cannot imagine anything else. I've tried to write about California, but nothing has come of it. My body was there, but my soul was not. The old place is all I can write about.\" </p> <p>It is in the cemetery of often unmarked graves that Gaines's bond to the past feels most sacred. \"That's the thing that draws me, because my people's spirit is there, their dust and bones. When I was researching A Gathering of Old Men, I talked to people who had known my grandparents' grandparents, known slaves. And when I was a child, so much that I experienced was not too different from what my people had gone through then.</p> <p>\"One of the things I tell young African-American writers is that our lives did not begin in the ghettos. We were brought here to work on the plantations, in the rural South, and these things are worth writing about, too. But I had no intention of recording that past when I started writing. Because I did not know then that it would go away.\" </p> <p>Much as he loved his home, Gaines knew that if he did not leave while young, it would destroy him. Though his own community felt safe, every contact with whites was a spirit-sapping ritual of averted eyes, absent rights, humiliation. Those who stayed bent to those rules, or broke. Almost all the men he knew have died, many violently. A Gathering of Old Men imagines that generation standing tall, for one day. Like all his work, it shows how they could have lived, not how they did. </p> <p>The Californian town he went to was a disorienting dream, an integrated, migrant community. Most vital to him, though, coming from a place with no book but the Bible, was its library. \"It changed my world,\" he remembers. \"I was a lonely kid. I'd sit there for hours. At first I picked up books indiscriminately, then after a while I found I liked Russian novelists, because they wrote about peasant life, which felt akin to what I'd known. It stirred something in me. And after a while, I took the pencil and the paper, and started to write about my background.\" </p> <p>Education at Stanford, especially in Wallace Stegner's legendary course for burgeoning novelists - where his classmates included Ken Kesey and Robert Stone - added to his self-belief. There, post-Beat, he was a bohemian. But he never wavered from his theme: the Southern past. It is an uncomfortable subject for many Americans. In period films and TV now, the young are shown black people more assertive, more central than they could really have been, racism reduced. </p> <p>Gaines will not go that far. \"Even back in the 60s, I was told they were tired of being reminded about the plantations,\" he says. \"I know it can be hard for some people, black and white, they don't want to remember. Before, people had refused to discuss those times - in writing, even in their homes. I did not want to school anybody. I just felt there were stories I could tell.\"</p>",

Of walks taken, or of walks that are yet to be taken? Everything, apart from the thick layer of dust that has settled over the years, is as it was, only waiting for interpretation, for explanation. </p> <p>\"The whole world,\" as we are reminded, is, according to the Talmud, a \"mass of sealed words and hidden things\". What is Rodinsky's secret? Was he one of the 36 just men, the unknown righteous whose good works alone keep the world from being destroyed? Had he achieved the cabbalistic secret of invisibility? Was he now a golem, \"that which has been banished,\" as Sinclair puts it, \"an atavistic cartoon... the ugly shape of something that has gone and cannot be recalled\"? Or is he now something else: \"Rodinsky, the idea of Rodinsky , had become a dybbuk. The soul of a dead person who enters the body of a living human and directs their conduct.\" </p> <p>As you can see, there is plenty here for Iain Sinclair, psychogeographer and writer (not to mention a whole legion of trades, abilities, data, and confluences) to go \"woo!\" at us with. Too much, perhaps, too tempting for someone whose trademark style, or way of thinking, combines both apocalyptic mysticism and hard-boiled legwork. (There is a phonic similarity - which no-one picks up on, probably because it is, well, too phoney - between \"shamus\", Chandlerese for a detective, and shames, the caretaker of a synagogue.) </p> <p>This is \"material that operates like the shorthand summary of a Paul Auster novel,\" he says, and, in a sentence that can sum up the entire genre, \"Projected mysteries that become actual.\" </p> <p>So he doesn't really tell the story: he comments on it, frames it, but gradually drops out of it, in chapters he alternates with Rachel Lichtenstein, whose book this really is. An artist born shortly after Rodinsky died, she became obsessed by his story, the unspoken narrative. She was the living human whose soul had been taken over, if we allow for a certain metaphorical tweaking; and in discovering Rodinsky's identity and fate she learns about, and indeed influences, her own. </p> <p>This is a biography whose subject is not there; it is the real-life counterpart to Perec's La Disparition, the novel written without the letter \"e\". Like that work, this one is really about Jewish disappearances, one of which will always be the exterminations and flight from Europe; and the other, from East London to - well, take your pick - Golders Green, Hendon, those places within the 'eruv' of the M25. Lichtenstein's journey takes her further: to Israel, to Poland, particularly Krakow (where, a decade ago, I had the most haunting moment of my life to date, catching the eye of what looked like the oldest, most ghostly human beings on earth, the last orthodox inhabitants of the Jewish ghetto, survivors against surely impossible odds), to her own tangled heritage. </p> <p>As you can see, this is a rather special book, which at times seems to verge on its own disappearance. We are somewhere \"between Welfare State poverty fable and Dostoevskian myth\", the book's bathos part of its ambiguous message.</p>",

Everything, apart from the thick layer of dust that has settled over the years, is as it was, only waiting for interpretation, for explanation. \"The whole world,\" as we are reminded, is, according to the Talmud, a \"mass of sealed words and hidden things\". What is Rodinsky's secret? Was he one of the 36 just men, the unknown righteous whose good works alone keep the world from being destroyed? Had he achieved the cabbalistic secret of invisibility? Was he now a golem, \"that which has been banished,\" as Sinclair puts it, \"an atavistic cartoon... the ugly shape of something that has gone and cannot be recalled\"? Or is he now something else: \"Rodinsky, the idea of Rodinsky , had become a dybbuk. The soul of a dead person who enters the body of a living human and directs their conduct.\" As you can see, there is plenty here for Iain Sinclair, psychogeographer and writer (not to mention a whole legion of trades, abilities, data, and confluences) to go \"woo!\" at us with. Too much, perhaps, too tempting for someone whose trademark style, or way of thinking, combines both apocalyptic mysticism and hard-boiled legwork. (There is a phonic similarity - which no-one picks up on, probably because it is, well, too phoney - between \"shamus\", Chandlerese for a detective, and shames, the caretaker of a synagogue.) This is \"material that operates like the shorthand summary of a Paul Auster novel,\" he says, and, in a sentence that can sum up the entire genre, \"Projected mysteries that become actual.\" So he doesn't really tell the story: he comments on it, frames it, but gradually drops out of it, in chapters he alternates with Rachel Lichtenstein, whose book this really is. An artist born shortly after Rodinsky died, she became obsessed by his story, the unspoken narrative. She was the living human whose soul had been taken over, if we allow for a certain metaphorical tweaking; and in discovering Rodinsky's identity and fate she learns about, and indeed influences, her own. This is a biography whose subject is not there; it is the real-life counterpart to Perec's La Disparition, the novel written without the letter \"e\". Like that work, this one is really about Jewish disappearances, one of which will always be the exterminations and flight from Europe; and the other, from East London to - well, take your pick - Golders Green, Hendon, those places within the 'eruv' of the M25. Lichtenstein's journey takes her further: to Israel, to Poland, particularly Krakow (where, a decade ago, I had the most haunting moment of my life to date, catching the eye of what looked like the oldest, most ghostly human beings on earth, the last orthodox inhabitants of the Jewish ghetto, survivors against surely impossible odds), to her own tangled heritage. As you can see, this is a rather special book, which at times seems to verge on its own disappearance. We are somewhere \"between Welfare State poverty fable and Dostoevskian myth\", the book's bathos part of its ambiguous message.",

A fantastic strand of personal history that, at the merest hint of investigation, would reveal itself to be an ego-massaging piece of invention? Do you, lying in your tepid bath, project yourself into the role of explorer, adventurer, doctor, soldier? Or have you simply wished for a different identity, anything that would relieve you of the intolerable burden of having to spend another day as yourself? </p> <p>It would be an unusual - and, more to the point, unbearable - character who could truthfully answer no to any or all of these questions. Most of us have at one time or another yielded to the seductive charm of image manipulation, or have toyed with the possibility that we could, in fiction if not in fact, be someone else. </p> <p>Just as, when the latest serial killer hits the headlines, we shudder as we recognise our own murderous impulses, tales of impostors chime with our suppressed attraction to shape-shifting. But most of us don't deliberately assume another identity, just as we don't take to interring people beneath our floorboards. Impostors, an account of those lost souls who instead of embroidering their lives have radically restitched them, attempts to work out what provokes such a manic display of wholesale reinvention. </p> <p>The first stage in the process is to perform a kind of taxonomy. Thus, in these pages, we have various groups of impostors, ranging broadly from the fantasists, such as Louis de Rougemont, whose invented histories are so bizarre and incredible that they appear to invite unmasking, to those more pragmatically inclined pretenders - women, for example, passing themselves off as men in order to pursue lives as doctors, sailors and soldiers - who were simply trying to escape the constraints of the hand that life had dealt them. </p> <p>Sarah Burton uses Louis de Rougemont to open her book, for the good reason that his deception makes highly entertaining reading. It also illustrates the point that often a mere cigarette paper separates the con artist from the lunatic. In the 1890s de Rougemont wowed the readers of Wide World magazine with his tales of three decades lived, after death-defying shipwreck and a brief Crusoe-style sojourn on a deserted island, among an Australian tribe. Its members believed him to be a god - with the exception of his wife, Yamba, who knew him to be mortal but loved him all the same. </p> <p>One of de Rougemont's tactics was self-deprecation. He constantly drew attention to the strain caused by having to masquerade as a divine being, asking his readers to empathise with his frequent sleights of hand, such as furtively removing the poisonous fangs of snakes in order to \"survive\" their bites later. He describes the taxing business of having to defeat a troublesome rival chieftain (albeit with a stiletto hidden in his fist) thus: \"I would seize every opportunity of impressing the blacks by an almost intuitive instinct; and as the huge savage lay dead on the ground, I placed my foot on the wound, folded my arms, and looked round triumphantly upon the enthusiastic crowd, like a gladiator of old.\" </p> <p>As with so many of the oddballs in this book, de Rougemont was eventually a victim of his own success. His articles sparked a lively correspondence; both Wide World magazine and the Daily Chronicle, which covered the saga and published a whole slew of letters, saw a healthy boost to their circulations - even after de Rougemont was identified as Louis Grin, sometime manservant, failed entrepreneur, feckless husband and father and frequent visitor to the British Library Reading Room. The Daily Chronicle was unrepentant, arguing that de Rougemont/Grin had suffered a serious head injury falling out of a window, absolving both him and it of responsibility. Not that it did him much good: this castaway manqu\u00e9 ended his life selling matches on Shaftesbury Avenue. </p> <p>In all probability, de Rougemont knew that his unlikely impostures couldn't last for ever, and decided accordingly to really go for it. Such a strategy, as Burton points out in her account of the life or lives of Ferdinand Waldo Demara, sometimes comes up trumps. Demara rose phoenix-style from the ashes on numerous occasions to become a Trappist monk, an army doctor, a prison warder, a psychologist and a suicide (and, during the course of his careers, reportedly saved the lives of three badly injured men during the Korean war). Each time he was discovered those close to him were reluctant to censure him, and he became a favourite with the newspapers: \"Genius without Portfolio Unmasked Again\", \"Gentle Masquerader at It Again\" ran the headlines, almost fondly. His story even reached the level of celluloid commemoration, with Tony Curtis playing him in the film The Great Impostor . </p> <p>Much of the interest in a book of this nature lies purely in the detail of its case histories. Burton gives good value on this front, packing the book with examples, from well-known incidences of imposture that include Anna Anderson, James Barry and the much-married jazz musician, Billy Tipton (whose gender was only discovered after her death) to much more pedestrian attempts at pulling the wool over people's eyes. </p> <p>But Burton's theories as to the motivations behind imposture are less convincing; or, rather, they tell us what we can already guess. \"The 'real' lives impostors leave behind are almost uniformly intolerable and oppressive,\" she remarks, as if we would ever have imagined otherwise. Noting that several impostors cashed in on their notoriety by becoming actors or writing autobiographies, Burton suggests that \"it seems likely that this creative or theatrical bent was closely linked to their capacity for imposture\". Who'd have thought it? </p> <p>Despite the richness of its anecdotes, Impostors is a somewhat thin book. It appears to rely heavily on secondary sources, ending up as a superior cut-and-paste job; Demara's life, for example, has already been the subject of one biography and an extensive feature in Life. The book also tells us little of what really goes on in someone's head as they prepare, in that melodramatic phrase, \"to live a lie\"; nor, aside from the practical considerations, of what benefits such deception yields. It can't all be jam, after all. </p> <p>My favourite character in the book is a hapless chap (British, naturally) who, along with a host of others, pretended to be the \"lost Dauphin\", son of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. Augustus Meves was busy spinning his tale when he was brought face to face with another Dauphin wannabe, Karl Naundorff. At which point he \"became so confused by questions of identity that, on meeting Naundorff, he mistook him for himself, and was shortly afterwards certified as insane\".

In his 30s, he is already contracted to the New Yorker, the revered and prosperous American magazine so envied - without being much read - by foreign journalists. He shops in Manhattan boutiques, he tells us here, and spends deliciously drawn-out afternoons looking for \"good tomatoes\". And he specialises in books of a certain elegance and shallowness. </p> <p>Seabrook's method is to take a topical matter - in 1997 it was life on the internet, this time it is the triumph of the entertainment corporations - and subject it to refined and leisurely analysis. He quotes philosophers. He does a few interviews. He goes to a few symbolic places (which, quite often, happen to be in Manhattan). Most of all, in smooth, self-deprecating sentences, he writes about himself. </p> <p>Some parts of this book concern the New Yorker and Seabrook's career there. Others are simply his New Yorker articles, slightly adapted. And the linking sections in between, often as not, concern how he felt during these assignments, or how he went about doing them. You could call this narcissism or highly professional recycling, but Seabrook has a grander purpose. His recent working life, he suggests, is the embodiment of a great change in the culture around him: the arrival of \"nobrow\". </p> <p>Until the 90s, his argument goes, American culture was still firmly divided between \"highbrow\" and \"lowbrow\". Highbrow was paintings and theatre; lowbrow was movies and pop music. What kept them separate was social hierarchy: in the absence of an acknowledged class system, posh Americans defined themselves - and other Americans aspired to redefine themselves - by putting on their smartest clothes and going to Shakespeare festivals. </p> <p>Then they stopped. Or at least, Seabrook did: \"At the age of 31, the stream of culture as it flowed through me slowed, stopped, and started moving in the other direction... Pop music provided me with peaks of lyricism and transcendence that I long ago stopped feeling at the opera and the symphony.\" He began wearing Chemical Brothers T-shirts to lunch with his dad. </p> <p>What caused Seabrook to abandon his family's traditions of tailored suits, \"taste\" and no television was the sparkly lure of showbusiness. Not the old sort, which had coexisted with \"high\" culture for decades and at times had sought to imitate it - rock bands attempting cod-classical works during the 70s and the like - but a new, all-consuming sort of showbiz called \"nobrow\" that drew no distinction between novelists and nodding bass players, and was simply interested in making money from both. Rupert Murdoch's enterprises, or one of the ever-swelling American cultural conglomerates, might be the best example of this; yet Seabrook, being Seabrook, picks his own employer. </p> <p>His portrait of the New Yorker 's shift during the 90s from a fusty chronicler of provincial Americana to a trend-chasing tip sheet for urban consumers is alive with well-caught details. There is his first editor, donnishly accepting an idea for an immense article on gold mining: \"'Oh, we don't have deadlines round here,' Gottlieb said, as if a faux pas had been committed.\" And there is Seabrook's next editor, Tina Brown, simultaneously commissioning articles while courting their celebrity subjects - once with Seabrook and his potential interviewee, an owner of casinos, both sitting in her office. The interweaving of analysis and autobiography is deft, as the magazine's better pieces always are. </p> <p>But the actual arguments, after a while, begin to stall. Were American high and low culture ever as separate as he makes out? Tweedy American academics such as Greil Marcus have been enthusing about pop music for decades now, while poor black teenagers have long been borrowing bits of Ivy League style. Seabrook also makes much of the speed with which celebrities can be constructed nowadays. But is that really new? Or is it just that America, a vast spread-out country where reputations used to travel slowly, has finally caught up with more urbanised, gossipy societies? Before MTV and the internet, names could still be made in weeks or days with a few evenings' notoriety on a London stage. </p> <p>The more academic chapters here, for all Seabrook's erudition and slickness, get a little coiled-up and laboured. This is often the downside of New Yorker writing, new and old: every logical leap is clarified in plain, almost folksy language. If you disagree or get impatient, it can feel like being locked in a classroom. </p> <p>The last third of the book, thankfully, is more of a field trip. Seabrook leaves his own life and Manhattan behind, and explores the cold new territories where \"nobrow\" products are grown. At Skywalker Ranch, the Californian headquarters of the Star Wars industry, the saga's creator George Lucas works two days a week, looking out on vineyards and reproduction farm buildings - while his underlings stare at computers in a windowless basement. Seabrook meets an anonymous program-tester with Repetitive Strain Injury: one day into a two-month stretch of continuous typing, just enough of her fingers to reach the keyboard are left free of bandages. </p> <p>She does not complain, though. And as Seabrook meets other such cultural labourers, their bosses in their hilltop mansions and the apologists and evangelists for \"nobrow\" at a creepy conference held at the Disney Institute, the lack of self-analysis in this new industry chills each encounter. To the entertainment corporations, relentless effort and commercial reward are all. Interventions by outsiders, such as critical reviews or uncontrolled interviews, are old-fashioned and unwelcome. </p> <p>The author is one of those dissidents, it seems clear by the end. \"It really is appalling, when you think of it,\" he blurts out on escaping Skywalker Ranch. On the last page Seabrook stands shivering at the foot of the New Yorker 's new steel-grey office tower, like the disillusioned narrator of an allegorical novel, and declares that \"the last notions about editorial independence\" are \"entombed\" above him.

Alexandra's belief in him and her domination of her weak-willed husband meant that she and her lover became the rulers of the Russian Empire in its last chaotic days.

He became involved with the Khlysti, a sect that believed they could become closer to God through group sex; in 1903 he was denounced, but had already attracted powerful devotees who protected him from persecution.

Often the salvage work has been done by other photographers. After the death of Atget in 1927, the American photographer Berenice Abbott, then a pupil and girlfriend of Man Ray, bought thousands of his glass-plate negatives and prints. She later sold them to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, thus providing them with an archive of one of the greatest photographers. </p> <p>Thirty years later, Lee Friedlander, who would himself become one of the great American photographers, discovered the glass-plate negatives of EJ Bellocq, whose 1912 pictures of prostitutes in Storyville, the red-light district of New Orleans, are some of the most mysterious and beautiful photographic portraits ever made. Friedlander bought the plates and printed a number of them (there were no existing Bellocq prints); they were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970. Now another body of pictures, this time by a little-known American photographer, William Gedney, has found an audience with this book and an exhibition currently at the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco. </p> <p>It was not that Gedney was totally unknown or unexhibited before his death from Aids in 1989. In fact, he had what would generally be considered auspicious beginnings. He started taking photographs in the mid-50s after studying graphics at the Pratt Institute in New York. His early pictures - of his Brooklyn home and of Kentucky, where for 11 productive days in 1964 he stayed with a poor white family, the Cornetts - were praised by Szarkowski and helped him to a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1966-7.</p> <p>His intention - to travel across the country making \"Photographic Studies of American Life\" - linked him not only to Walker Evans, whose American Photographs is one of the most influential photography books of the 20th century, but also to Robert Frank, who had set out a decade earlier funded by the same fellowship and returned with the photographs that made up The Americans. </p> <p>Gedney could hardly fail to be influenced by both. His graceful black and white photographs come out of an earlier, more accepting era than today, when photography is dedicated to colour and the constructed ironies of conceptual art, but he was just as concerned with the question of art. He spent most of 1966-7 living with a group of hippies in Haight-Ashbury and planning a book of pictures tentatively called A Time of Youth.</p> <p>\"I am attempting a literary form in visual terms,\" he wrote. \"I am telling a story with characters that reappear and scenes that are repeated.\" In this sense his project had similarities with Larry Clark's Tulsa and Danny Lyon's Bikeriders - the kind of stories in which the photographer has to be both emotionally involved with his subjects and detached at the same time.</p> <p>Physical proximity wasn't a problem - the hippies were inert for a lot of the time, smoking dope, sleeping, tripping, making love - but he couldn't photograph inside their heads. \"The book is weak in the nightmare area,\" he wrote in March 1969, \"section number 5, the drug scene, the sexual escape, the freakout scene, the despair. It is understressed, but I don't have the pictures to do it properly... so much of the drug thing is interior, with very little exterior effects anyway. It is a mind thing, and hard to show visually (at least the psychedelic drugs).

      "bodyText": "What Was True: The Photographs and Notebooks of William Gedney ed Margaret Sartor and Geoff Dyer WW Norton, \u00a323, 192pp Buy it at BOL Unlike the history of painting and sculpture, the history of photography has been only fitfully assembled, with many gaps and omissions, some only now being filled. Often the salvage work has been done by other photographers. After the death of Atget in 1927, the American photographer Berenice Abbott, then a pupil and girlfriend of Man Ray, bought thousands of his glass-plate negatives and prints. She later sold them to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, thus providing them with an archive of one of the greatest photographers. Thirty years later, Lee Friedlander, who would himself become one of the great American photographers, discovered the glass-plate negatives of EJ Bellocq, whose 1912 pictures of prostitutes in Storyville, the red-light district of New Orleans, are some of the most mysterious and beautiful photographic portraits ever made. Friedlander bought the plates and printed a number of them (there were no existing Bellocq prints); they were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970. Now another body of pictures, this time by a little-known American photographer, William Gedney, has found an audience with this book and an exhibition currently at the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco. It was not that Gedney was totally unknown or unexhibited before his death from Aids in 1989. In fact, he had what would generally be considered auspicious beginnings. He started taking photographs in the mid-50s after studying graphics at the Pratt Institute in New York. His early pictures - of his Brooklyn home and of Kentucky, where for 11 productive days in 1964 he stayed with a poor white family, the Cornetts - were praised by Szarkowski and helped him to a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1966-7. His intention - to travel across the country making \"Photographic Studies of American Life\" - linked him not only to Walker Evans, whose American Photographs is one of the most influential photography books of the 20th century, but also to Robert Frank, who had set out a decade earlier funded by the same fellowship and returned with the photographs that made up The Americans. Gedney could hardly fail to be influenced by both. His graceful black and white photographs come out of an earlier, more accepting era than today, when photography is dedicated to colour and the constructed ironies of conceptual art, but he was just as concerned with the question of art. He spent most of 1966-7 living with a group of hippies in Haight-Ashbury and planning a book of pictures tentatively called A Time of Youth. \"I am attempting a literary form in visual terms,\" he wrote. \"I am telling a story with characters that reappear and scenes that are repeated.\" In this sense his project had similarities with Larry Clark's Tulsa and Danny Lyon's Bikeriders - the kind of stories in which the photographer has to be both emotionally involved with his subjects and detached at the same time. Physical proximity wasn't a problem - the hippies were inert for a lot of the time, smoking dope, sleeping, tripping, making love - but he couldn't photograph inside their heads. \"The book is weak in the nightmare area,\" he wrote in March 1969, \"section number 5, the drug scene, the sexual escape, the freakout scene, the despair. It is understressed, but I don't have the pictures to do it properly... so much of the drug thing is interior, with very little exterior effects anyway. It is a mind thing, and hard to show visually (at least the psychedelic drugs). I think with hard drugs it is easier to show.\" And then, \"But perhaps the dramatic structure of the book is close to life, the dramatic moments are brief and few in anyone's life.\" A photographer who keeps notes offers a rare opportunity to understand more about his work on a literal as well as a visual level, and possibly allows a more intimate glimpse into his life.

But this gloriously ragged first novel from John Kelly (recently voted, we are told - also rather inauspiciously - one of the \"20 hippest people in Ireland\") is less apprentice pop shocker, more the bastard progeny of Patrick McCabe and Flann O'Brien. </p> <p>There's the dark vision of the rural North of the 70s, those \"idyllic, murderous days\" in a childhood of plaster saints and Action Man, married to the time-honoured tale of the outsider artist and peppered with a fair amount of blarney, visitations and saints (\"like Marvel superheroes - each with special gifts and uniforms\"). With mother vanished, father a \"slayer of moo-moos\" and domineering grandma constantly on religious pilgrimages, the precocious violence of this new butcher boy is no surprise. And though murder (especially the pre-teen seashore dispatching of a palaeontologist with the little hammer of the title) could be called the apotheosis of plot, here it's more of a variation on a pointillist theme than a literary event. </p> <p>The narrator, a \"painter of weirdy pictures\", intersperses distant memories and present obsessions with old newspaper cuttings and encyclopaedic observations on wildlife and iconography. He is engaged in a confessional catharsis - \"like a weekend on Lough Derg or a good boke\" - and the book is full of burying and boking, as he struggles with the paranoid need to conceal the past and the exhibitionist desire to vomit it all out. </p> <p>His tale begins in the crib (\"I spent some years in this cot patiently waiting to be sprung\") and proceeds along the Catholic stations: the first visit to the \"hushing Tardis\" of the confessional box, the traditional horrors of the priest-run grammar school framed in Portrait of the Artist and burlesqued in O'Brien's The Hard Life. Kelly turns in a fine version: the freezing corridors \"with fearsome portraits of bishops constantly developing out of black nooks\", the thick country priests, the schoolroom persecution (\"How am I supposed to know how to spell abattoir - I'm not a fucking Frenchman! I'm only 12 years old for fuck's sake!\"). Immediate, passionate and shot through with descriptive brilliance, the narrative voice is both charming and convincing; it is only gradually that the artist's rages and paranoias become something more chilling than eccentricity. </p> <p>After the theft of a holy icon from Prague and the death of his beloved grandma, the novel - always impressionistic in its attitude to the real and the surreal - descends into delusion, with visits from Elvis (modest, deferential, very interested in Irish cuisine), the dead granny and St Peter himself, and fevered letter-writing campaigns to the Pope. The narrator's love/hate object has more of the nurse than the girlfriend about her; the reading of dead newspapers smacks of institutionalisation; his weirdy pictures are perhaps not an international success after all and his constant complaint that he's \"talking to the wall\" may be literally true. In his Psycho-esque finale Kelly overdoes what worked brilliantly as sinister suggestion, and we're back in the easier, shallower waters of shock-value twists and neat conclusions. </p> <p>It is a disappointing end to a strange and frustrating book: ambitious yet slapdash, thematically dense but unstructured, an easy-reading novel that nods to all the Irish greats - sometimes boldly, sometimes in their thrall. Yet similar criticisms could be made of O'Brien, whose tone of callous whimsy Kelly so effortlessly updates. And while that's a backhanded compliment, it is also pretty high praise.</p>",

He is engaged in a confessional catharsis - \"like a weekend on Lough Derg or a good boke\" - and the book is full of burying and boking, as he struggles with the paranoid need to conceal the past and the exhibitionist desire to vomit it all out. His tale begins in the crib (\"I spent some years in this cot patiently waiting to be sprung\") and proceeds along the Catholic stations: the first visit to the \"hushing Tardis\" of the confessional box, the traditional horrors of the priest-run grammar school framed in Portrait of the Artist and burlesqued in O'Brien's The Hard Life. Kelly turns in a fine version: the freezing corridors \"with fearsome portraits of bishops constantly developing out of black nooks\", the thick country priests, the schoolroom persecution (\"How am I supposed to know how to spell abattoir - I'm not a fucking Frenchman! I'm only 12 years old for fuck's sake!\"). Immediate, passionate and shot through with descriptive brilliance, the narrative voice is both charming and convincing; it is only gradually that the artist's rages and paranoias become something more chilling than eccentricity. After the theft of a holy icon from Prague and the death of his beloved grandma, the novel - always impressionistic in its attitude to the real and the surreal - descends into delusion, with visits from Elvis (modest, deferential, very interested in Irish cuisine), the dead granny and St Peter himself, and fevered letter-writing campaigns to the Pope. The narrator's love/hate object has more of the nurse than the girlfriend about her; the reading of dead newspapers smacks of institutionalisation; his weirdy pictures are perhaps not an international success after all and his constant complaint that he's \"talking to the wall\" may be literally true. In his Psycho-esque finale Kelly overdoes what worked brilliantly as sinister suggestion, and we're back in the easier, shallower waters of shock-value twists and neat conclusions. It is a disappointing end to a strange and frustrating book: ambitious yet slapdash, thematically dense but unstructured, an easy-reading novel that nods to all the Irish greats - sometimes boldly, sometimes in their thrall. Yet similar criticisms could be made of O'Brien, whose tone of callous whimsy Kelly so effortlessly updates. And while that's a backhanded compliment, it is also pretty high praise.",

And big public relations companies do offer management consultancy advice. So, there is on-going confusion in this area.\" </p> <p>There was a trend in the early nineties for big boys in management consultancy like Coopers and Lybrand and Price Waterhouse to offer a one stop shop to their clients with public relations as part of the deal.

John Birt was famously slated for spending \u00a310m of licence payers' fees on management consultants at the BBC, although Will White, in defence of his industry, points out that this saved the corporation \u00a3500m, so there was a demonstrable effect, even if it wasn't to the programme makers' taste. </p> <p>The MCA defines a management consultant as someone whose role is to give independent advice and assistance about management issues such as pinpointing problems and or opportunities, advising the client on what to do about them and helping the client see their recommendations through. </p> <p>Sounds a bit vague? There are management consultants currently in the Ukraine advising on how to privatise the oil industry. Management consultants have advised the railway corporations in African countries on organisation, manpower, equipment replacement and future development. </p> <p>Management consultants can have a vital role to play in a merger or acquisition, although it may not always be a pleasant one. Will White acknowledges the scapegoat role management consultants may unwillingly be forced to play if there is downsizing to be done. </p> <p>\"Sometimes the firm has made up its mind and pushes the consultant to a certain conclusion,\" he says. </p> <p>Company politics have to be carefully negotiated and management consultancies need to work to a very clear brief. </p> <p>But the rewards are good. Starting salaries for bright graduates are about \u00a326,000 and it is said that some big players will shell out as much as \u00a330,000 for a brisk young BA or BSc of the right calibre. </p> <p>And that's just the beginning. The very nature of the job gives management consultants unrivalled access to the highest levels in a company. </p> <p>This gives scope for cross-overs with consultants joining companies they have advised. And sometimes the traffic is the other way. </p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, management consultancy is not about bright young things descending on a company with quick-fix solutions </p> <p>\"There is a very fine line between using bright young people and people with experience and management consultancy agencies do bring in people with a background in industry or commerce,\" says White. \"And younger people go out with the more experienced to learn on the job.\" </p> <p>White says there is more travel in management consultancy than public relations and the relationship with the client is different. </p> <p>\"Management consultants go in for a short period often to deal with one issue, like, for example, installing IT systems in banks so they are EMU compliant,\" says White. \"Public relations firms have an on-going relationship with their clients perhaps on a monthly fixed contract.\" </p> <p>The macho image of management consultancy is also changing with more and more consultancies offering their female staff flexible job packages which might include part-time or home working.</p> <p><strong>Public Relations</strong></p> <p>Public relations, of course, has always been seen as a female dominated business, a people business - but that is in flux. Anne Mealor, head of marketing at the Institute of Public Relations (IPR), says it is now fifty-fifty women and men at the recruitment stage of the business and racial equality has never been an issue. </p> <p>\"In local authority public relations, for example, there is a good racial mix which reflects the the local population. And local authorities are equal opportunities employers,\" she says, citing Tower Hamlets in London as a good example. </p> <p>Mealor believes that public relations is gaining some ground from management consultancy. In an age where image can make or break a company, public relations can have a very direct effect on the bottom line. Linked with effective marketing it can turn a company around. </p> <p>\"Communications is being brought in more at the planning stage because communications is so vital to a company strategy,\" she says. </p> <p> This trend has strength ened the hand of public relations since 20 years ago when it was seen as a bit of a bolt-on luxury. The public relations section of a company was often the first to go in hard times. </p> <p>\"Before it was a luxury, but now it's essential. Public relations is needed even more when a company is struggling,\" says Mealor. \"Reputation and image are very important to turnover.\" </p> <p>The IPR says that its own industry is arguably the most powerful and effective weapon in the marketing communications armoury of public and private organisations. </p> <p> Getting your message across whether it is about a product, a service or a position people hold is vital in the multi-media communications age. It is an essential across the board - from lobby groups and residents associations through to the biggest commercial organisations and the heart of governments. Variety is obviously one of the attractions of a public relations career. It can offer work in the purely commercial sector or in local or national government, for charities, political parties, hospital trusts and any number of quangos. </p> <p>One of the disadvantages of its popularity as a career is that starting salaries can be quite low with \u00a316,000 being an average in local government. </p> <p>\"An account manager with an agency gets about \u00a324,000 and an account director about \u00a330,000. In house can be better and the highest starting salaries are in the financial sector,\" says Mealor. </p> <p>Like management consultants, public relations people have access at the highest level. It was not always the case with hired-in agencies who might have dealt mostly with middle managers. </p> <p>Yet again, the importance of a good communications strategy has upgraded public relations. </p> <p>\"A lot of public relations work is in crisis management and for that you need direct access to the top. That can create a lot of jealousy in a company,\" warns Mealor. </p> <p>An in-house director of corporate affairs will report to the chief executive and someone in that position can earn big bucks, like the rumoured \u00a3150,000-plus for the new appointee at Railtrack. </p> <p>The Institute of Public Relations is working hard on its own image and offers the full package you would expect from a professional body - a code of conduct, a diploma, career development and a raft of events. </p> <p>Entrants to public relations need to be graduates and Mealor advises students to check that a PR degree is IPR endorsed. Those who do non-vocational degrees can do a post graduate course or take an IPR course. </p> <p>Both management consultancy and public relations demand a high degree of commitment from their work force and people are expected to work long hours. </p> <p>\"In public relations you need to be creative and have a good business sense. You must also be level headed and calm and be able to take pressure,\" says Mealor.</p> <p><strong> What to do next</strong> </p> <p>The IPR is holding a careers day in Manchester on April 13. </p> <p>Websites to visit: <a href=\"http://www.ipr.org.uk\">www.ipr.org.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mca.org.uk  \">www.mca.org.uk</a></p>",

Contrary to popular belief, management consultancy is not about bright young things descending on a company with quick-fix solutions \"There is a very fine line between using bright young people and people with experience and management consultancy agencies do bring in people with a background in industry or commerce,\" says White. \"And younger people go out with the more experienced to learn on the job.\" White says there is more travel in management consultancy than public relations and the relationship with the client is different. \"Management consultants go in for a short period often to deal with one issue, like, for example, installing IT systems in banks so they are EMU compliant,\" says White. \"Public relations firms have an on-going relationship with their clients perhaps on a monthly fixed contract.\" The macho image of management consultancy is also changing with more and more consultancies offering their female staff flexible job packages which might include part-time or home working. Public Relations Public relations, of course, has always been seen as a female dominated business, a people business - but that is in flux. Anne Mealor, head of marketing at the Institute of Public Relations (IPR), says it is now fifty-fifty women and men at the recruitment stage of the business and racial equality has never been an issue. \"In local authority public relations, for example, there is a good racial mix which reflects the the local population. And local authorities are equal opportunities employers,\" she says, citing Tower Hamlets in London as a good example. Mealor believes that public relations is gaining some ground from management consultancy. In an age where image can make or break a company, public relations can have a very direct effect on the bottom line. Linked with effective marketing it can turn a company around. \"Communications is being brought in more at the planning stage because communications is so vital to a company strategy,\" she says. This trend has strength ened the hand of public relations since 20 years ago when it was seen as a bit of a bolt-on luxury. The public relations section of a company was often the first to go in hard times. \"Before it was a luxury, but now it's essential. Public relations is needed even more when a company is struggling,\" says Mealor. \"Reputation and image are very important to turnover.\" The IPR says that its own industry is arguably the most powerful and effective weapon in the marketing communications armoury of public and private organisations. Getting your message across whether it is about a product, a service or a position people hold is vital in the multi-media communications age. It is an essential across the board - from lobby groups and residents associations through to the biggest commercial organisations and the heart of governments. Variety is obviously one of the attractions of a public relations career. It can offer work in the purely commercial sector or in local or national government, for charities, political parties, hospital trusts and any number of quangos. One of the disadvantages of its popularity as a career is that starting salaries can be quite low with \u00a316,000 being an average in local government. \"An account manager with an agency gets about \u00a324,000 and an account director about \u00a330,000. In house can be better and the highest starting salaries are in the financial sector,\" says Mealor. Like management consultants, public relations people have access at the highest level. It was not always the case with hired-in agencies who might have dealt mostly with middle managers. Yet again, the importance of a good communications strategy has upgraded public relations. \"A lot of public relations work is in crisis management and for that you need direct access to the top. That can create a lot of jealousy in a company,\" warns Mealor. An in-house director of corporate affairs will report to the chief executive and someone in that position can earn big bucks, like the rumoured \u00a3150,000-plus for the new appointee at Railtrack. The Institute of Public Relations is working hard on its own image and offers the full package you would expect from a professional body - a code of conduct, a diploma, career development and a raft of events. Entrants to public relations need to be graduates and Mealor advises students to check that a PR degree is IPR endorsed. Those who do non-vocational degrees can do a post graduate course or take an IPR course. Both management consultancy and public relations demand a high degree of commitment from their work force and people are expected to work long hours. \"In public relations you need to be creative and have a good business sense. You must also be level headed and calm and be able to take pressure,\" says Mealor. What to do next The IPR is holding a careers day in Manchester on April 13.

Spokesman Mark Austin said: \"There's a lot of confusion marketing going on in the credit card field, and the headline rates you see are not always what they seem.\" </p> <p>He points to the longer introductory rate period on the Tesco card. Anyone taking out the Tesco card enjoys the 4.9% rate until January 1, 2001, five months longer than the low-rate period from Capital One.

Its analysis shows that the old stockmarket maxim, \"Sell in May and go away\" (which goes back to the days when City stockbrokers left their desks for the \"season\" of Ascot, Henley and Wimbledon) has more than a ring of truth about it. </p> <p>Figures for the FTSE All share index going back to 1965 show that the market is remarkably seasonal. April tends to be a very good month, with returns averaging 3.6%. But May is the worst, with typical returns of -0.6%. Neither do markets improve much after May.

      "bodyText": "Over the next three weeks investors will pour up to \u00a34bn into Isas to take advantage of the tax-free plans before the April 5 end of tax-year deadline, but City experts are warning that now may be about the worst time to buy. The tidal wave of cash from small investors is likely to push up the stockmarket as the money is invested in shares, but once the tap is turned off in mid-April, the process will go into reverse, with share prices dipping because of the lack of demand. The warning comes from Salomon Smith Barney, a major London investment bank. Its analysis shows that the old stockmarket maxim, \"Sell in May and go away\" (which goes back to the days when City stockbrokers left their desks for the \"season\" of Ascot, Henley and Wimbledon) has more than a ring of truth about it. Figures for the FTSE All share index going back to 1965 show that the market is remarkably seasonal. April tends to be a very good month, with returns averaging 3.6%. But May is the worst, with typical returns of -0.6%. Neither do markets improve much after May. As the graphic shows, the best months for investment tend to be in autumn and winter rather than summer. A spokesman for Saloman Smith Barney says: \"Last year we suggested a trading strategy of 'sell in April, stay away until October.'

This side of the business alone is worth $176.8bn (\u00a3110bn) to Fidelity, which has just overtaken Schwab as market leader. </p> <p>The principle of the investment supermarket is simple. Investors access a website which offers a broad range of mutual funds. These are available at a discount to the price the investor would pay if buying from an adviser or direct from the fund manager, which will usually charge the full initial charge - up to 5.25% - despite not providing advice. So far, it is hard to tell the difference between an investment or fund supermarket and a discount broker, and indeed, the two are very similar. But there are, in theory, two key points of contrast. </p> <p>The first is that where a discount broker offers no advice at all, the supermarket does offer the investor limited guidance. Egg's version has a facility called the \"investor profiler\" which asks questions about the customer's financial circumstances to build a picture of their attitude to risk and the purpose of the investment. A basket of funds is then suggested on the basis of this picture. It is important that this should not be construed as advice - since that would require more severe regulation - so the recommendations are based on quite loose criteria. </p> <p>Egg suggests a handful of funds based on fund sectors that appear to suit the investor's purposes. There is a fine line, however, between this type of service and the fund analysis service offered by many discount brokers. The only difference is that the brokers do not claim to make any recommendations, only to offer a view. </p> <p>The other differentiator is that the supermarket allows investors to buy and sell within a single account to make it easier to track the value of all the holdings. Egg also provides something it calls the personal balance sheet, into which customers can enter all their financial details, including those held outside Egg. Elements of the customer's finances that Egg can get information on are updated automatically to create a consolidated record of all the customer's financial affairs. </p> <p>Egg says the supermarket is designed to appeal to a broad church of relatively unsophisticated investors who are not comfortable with choosing investments from scratch but do not want to pay for advice. With a starting line-up of only 169 funds out of a universe of over 1,500 unit trusts and open ended-investment companies they certainly will not be bamboozled. Mike Harris, chief executive of Egg, says this is deliberate: \"To have 169 funds covering all sectors is enough for most investors,\" he says. </p> <p>Despite that, Egg does plan to add more to the range as time goes by, but there is a long way to go before it reaches the breadth of service offered by Fidelity in the US, which sells 4,100 funds. Of these 900 have no initial charge; these are known as \"no load\" funds which have not really taken off in the UK. </p> <p>Another limitation on Egg's market is that until the new tax year, which starts on April 6, only Egg's 1m customers will be able to use it. After that date, it will be open to anyone who opens an Egg savings account. </p> <p>Egg was not the only outfit to open a supermarket this week. Torquil Clark (TC), a Wolverhampton-based advisory broker, also joined the fray. TC's service offers access to 600 funds from 39 managers. TC's 35,000 personal equity plan (Pep) and Isa customers already use the site to track the \u00a3350m that is invested in their portfolios but is unlikely to be able to compete against Egg, which has a stronger brand and can draw on the deep pockets of the Pru to maintain a competitive edge. </p> <p>The introductory offers are an illustration of this. Until April 27, visitors to the Egg supermarket will be able to claim a 1% cashback on any Isa investment. Where the Isa carries no initial charge - most do not - the investor stands to make an instant profit. There are also discounts that bring the initial charges down to a maximum of 1.5% and minimum of 0% - rather than a typical 3.5% to 5.25% - on other funds sold through the market. TC's offers comprise an ongoing \u00a325 flat fee for Isa investments and discounts of up to 5.25%. These are good value, but do not have the instant appeal of the cashback offer. </p> <p>In fact, the cashback offer has forced at least one other discount broker to revise its marketing strategy - an early indication of the sort of pressure Egg is likely to exert on the current players in the market. Allenbridge, the third largest discount broker in the UK, has traditionally offered a guarantee that its discounts are the lowest to be found. This was backed up by an offer to double the difference if anyone can find a better discount elsewhere. </p> <p>Anthony Yadgaroff, managing director of Allenbridge, says since Egg made its cashback offer Allenbridge can no longer afford to maintain this guarantee. Allenbridge pays for its guarantee by giving up trail commission for sufficient time to make up the cost. To match Egg's deal would mean making no money for five years. However, the firm will fight back with its own fund supermarket, which is currently under development. It hopes to offer Sharpe ratios and other specialised risk and return measures as part of the service. </p> <p>Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK's largest discount broker, seems more perplexed than alarmed by the Egg deal. \"When I first heard about these things a while ago I thought: 'These things could be bad news for us,' but so far I just don't see it,\" he says. Fidelity and Charles Schwab, with their experience in the US market, are taking a clearer view and plan to launch their own supermarkets this summer. </p> <p>Few details are available on the Schwab project, but a spokeswoman says it will start off in a fairly modest way with a limited range of funds. Fidelity will provide a similar range of fund managers, but each will make their whole range available bringing the total funds on offer to about 300. It will also set up a site for financial advisers.</p>",

Mr Moulton accepted selling them would be difficult. </p> <p>\"There are two groups of workers at Longbridge. There are people who will lose their jobs, which we bitterly regret but that it is inevitable,\" he said. \"There is another group of workers who will have greater opportunities and they will not be staring over their shoulders fearing redundancy.\" </p> <p>Mr Byers said Alchemy was not a \"done deal\" and suggested a new buyer could be found. \"I think people would be more confident if someone with an established reputation took over Longbridge. We will find out more in the next few weeks,\" he said. </p> <p>After his plant visit, Mr Byers said: \"I walked on the track at Longbridge and spoke to a number of men who've worked there for decades ... We mustn't turn our backs on those people. They deserve the full backing at this time and they will get it. I understand the anger that they feel.\" </p> <p>Ford, the new owner of the Land Rover range, is unlikely to reduce radically the 10,000-strong Solihull workforce.</p>",

BMW yesterday continued its surprise reverse out of UK motor manufacturing when it confirmed the sale of its successful Land Rover complex in Solihull to Ford for \u00a31.85bn. Downing Street made it clear that the prime minister was furious that Britain had been kept in the dark about BMW's sell-off plans. Ministers are angry that German officials were discussing the sell-off of Rover while they were negotiating with the European Commission in Brussels for a \u00a3152m aid package for Longbridge. \"That is not the way the prime minister believes people should do business,\" a Downing Street spokesman said. The German company blamed the strong pound for its decision to shed Longbridge and refused to accept the blame for loss-making Rover's problems. \"We reached the limit that we could tolerate,\" a spokesman said. Prof Milberg said the high value of sterling made \"an already very difficult situation even worse\", as he reopened the row over Britain's membership of the euro. Government claims that it was unaware the high pound was fuelling a BMW rethink were undermined by Michael Heseltine, who disclosed that a director had warned him over dinner last month. \"The government cannot begin to suggest that BMW weren't concerned about this,\" said the Tory former deputy prime minister and industry secretary. \"The guy I spoke to made no secret of it.\" John Moulton, the head of Alchemy Partners, which set up the MG Car Company to take over Longbridge, made clear it will concentrate on sports cars in the future, with new Lotus-style models, including a sporty saloon. Production will be around 40,000 in five years and peak on the most optimistic forecasts at under 100,000, compared to the current 180,000 vehicles-a-year output. Longbridge is carrying five months stock of the Rover 25 and 45 cars and the models will not be replaced. Mr Moulton accepted selling them would be difficult. \"There are two groups of workers at Longbridge. There are people who will lose their jobs, which we bitterly regret but that it is inevitable,\" he said. \"There is another group of workers who will have greater opportunities and they will not be staring over their shoulders fearing redundancy.\" Mr Byers said Alchemy was not a \"done deal\" and suggested a new buyer could be found. \"I think people would be more confident if someone with an established reputation took over Longbridge. We will find out more in the next few weeks,\" he said. After his plant visit, Mr Byers said: \"I walked on the track at Longbridge and spoke to a number of men who've worked there for decades ... We mustn't turn our backs on those people. They deserve the full backing at this time and they will get it. I understand the anger that they feel.\" Ford, the new owner of the Land Rover range, is unlikely to reduce radically the 10,000-strong Solihull workforce.",

      "body": "<p>The Daily Mirror's Budget headline was \"Flash Gordon\", while the Daily Express shouted \"Everyone a winner\", and even the usually hostile Daily Mail hailed the chancellor as \"Moneybags\". Will the headlines this year greet an \"e-conomy\" Budget, or slam a steep rise in property taxes? </p> <p>Swingeing increases in stamp duty on property is the favourite prediction for this Tuesday. The government is in the middle of its first term, its coffers are full, but no-one expects a giveaway Budget. Gordon Brown will win plaudits from the City for not loosening the purse strings when economic growth is, if anything, too vigorous, and will win support from his party for keeping his powder dry ahead of a probable pre-election Budget next year. </p> <p>\"I don't see Gordon Brown spraying the money around. Tax revenues are healthy, there's a lot in the pipeline already, and I don't expect a further raft of major changes,\" says PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) partner John Whiting, one of the leading tax experts in the UK. </p> <p>Nonetheless, pulling a rabbit out of the hat at the end of his speech is now a Budget day tradition, and as our guide below shows, the pundits are speculating about significant reforms to property and personal taxes. What's more, staged changes announced in last year's Budget, such as removing the married couple's allowance and Miras, will hit taxpayers hard over the next tax year. </p> <p>Inside the chancellor's Red Box? </p> <p><strong>Stamp duty on houses</strong> </p> <p>A hike in stamp duty on expensive houses is seen as a neat way to take the froth out of the property market without having to increase interest rates, which hurts manufacturing. But the increase could be painful for anyone with a house in London and the south-east. Someone buying a home for \u00a3250,000 already faces a stamp duty bill of \u00a36,250 (up from \u00a35,000 last year), and if the rate rises from 2.5% to 3.5% the bill would be \u00a38,750. </p> <p>It's worse for houses worth \u00a3500,000 or more. The rate went up last year from 3% to 3.5%, taking the bill from a minimum of \u00a315,000 to \u00a317,500. This year it could hit 5%, giving the rich home buyer a bill of \u00a325,000. </p> <p>Last year the standard 1% on houses valued between \u00a360,000 and \u00a3250,000 did not move, nor was the zero rate on houses below \u00a360,000 changed. Few expect the chancellor to hit the struggling first-time buyer, but an increase in the other bands will be widely regarded as a \"tax on the south\". </p> <p>Property consultants argue that a rise could have an impact the reverse of that intended. CKD Kennedy Macpherson, a consultancy that specialises in country houses and estates, says: \"The chancellor may increase stamp duty in an attempt to cool the market in the south east. But by putting up the cost of selling, it will reduce the number of these properties for sale, and as a result, prices will rise.\" </p> <p>But the argument may fall on deaf ears. Even if the chancellor raised stamp duty to 7%, it would still be the lowest in any EU country. </p> <p><strong>Betting duty reform</strong> </p> <p>The \u00a31.5bn the government picks up from the 9% levy on betting is leaking away badly with the exodus of punters to offshore (but on-line) bookies operating from Alderney to Australia. The Inland Revenue is not happy. \"A certain amount of tightening up is almost inevitable,\" says PWC's Mr Whiting. </p> <p>The flow overseas could be staunched by a cut in the levy, but noises from the Treasury are not encouraging. </p> <p>What the government does will be a test of how it handles the huge threat to its tax base from the shift of commerce into cyberspace. Already thousands of people are importing CDs from abroad via internet sites, and evading Customs &amp; Excise in the process. </p> <p>When new MP3 technology becomes widespread, allowing net users to download music and videos directly from the web, the loss to the Revenue could become substantial. </p> <p><strong>Lower tax burden on internet start-ups</strong> </p> <p>A peculiarity of the phenomenal leap in dot.com share prices is that the balance sheets of these young start-ups are creaking under the cost of reserving for share option schemes. Mr Whiting says: \"It's becoming a major issue; some net companies are already technically insolvent because of it.\" </p> <p>At issue is the 12.2% national insurance levied on the gain on options. When a share option of \u00a31 doubles from its issue price to \u00a32, the employer has to put aside 12.2p to pay NI. But if it goes from \u00a31 to \u00a320, in the style of many dot.coms, the reserve has to be \u00a32.32. Even for small companies the bill can be enormous. Expectations are that the chancellor will don an e-commerce hat and either cap employers' NI liability or allow companies to pass the cost on to employees. </p> <p>Separately, new rules on all-employee share schemes will be included in the finance bill, effectively replacing approved profit sharing schemes. It will allow companies to give small amounts of free shares to individuals and give other shares as part of a targeted bonus scheme. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen says: \"We expect a huge great rush as companies try to implement it and we understand that the shares schemes unit does not have enough people to cope with the expected deluge in August.\" </p> <p><strong>Insurance premium tax</strong> </p> <p>This tax on car, home and medical insurance went up from 4% to 5% in the last Budget and earned the chancellor a relatively painless \u00a3290m last year. The tax adds around \u00a315 to the annual cost of a car insurance policy, but is still low in comparison with rates levied on the continent. \"IPT is a soft target. In Europe it is around 10%, so we could see another rise here,\" says Mr Whiting. </p> <p>Taxes on petrol will almost certainly increase, but with the price of unleaded petrol already up to around 80p a litre compared to 68p at last year's Budget, the chancellor's room for manoeuvre will be limited. The increase in duty last year was 3.79p a litre. </p> <p>Changes to company car taxation were unveiled in the last Budget and will be phased in after April 2002. </p> <p><strong>Capital gains tax</strong> </p> <p>The rate of capital gains tax for individuals selling business assets is going to come down to 10% after five years - originally it was 10 years. More details on \"taper relief\" will come out in the Budget, and some experts are predicting that the taper will be extended to include any shares held through an employer's scheme. Tax accountants also want a simplification of the rules. </p> <p>There is some talk of applying CGT to gains made on house sales, but this is widely regarded as political suicide. The current exemption on CGT for individuals is \u00a37,100 and this is likely to be raised by a small amount. More important to the wave of new amateur stock market investors is the 0.5% stamp duty on share purchases. The City wants the duty to be abolished, but the doubling in share dealing volumes since November last year has netted the Treasury a bumper dividend running to almost \u00a33bn. Abolition would also pave the way for a sharp increase in \"day trading\" at a time when the authorities are increasingly nervous about the bubble in net stocks. </p> <p><strong>Inheritance tax</strong> </p> <p>Widespread (and legal) avoidance of this tax by the rich has made this a levy on middle-class homeowners rather than on big estates. \"There is a realisation that it is hitting the wrong people and we are expecting a revamp. But we don't expect fundamental change.\" The current rate is 40% on everything over \u00a3231,000. Changes could come in the gifts regime which allows assets to escape death duty if they are transferred seven years before death. </p> <p><strong>Income tax</strong> </p> <p>There is already a 1p reduction in income tax in hand to 22p from 23p starting on April 5. Almost no one expects a further cut, although personal allowances, currently a basic \u00a34,335 plus extra for married couples, are likely to be uprated in line with inflation or average earnings. And he may widen the 10p tax band by more than inflation. </p> <p>However, Mr Whiting says here lies the potential for the rabbit in the hat. \"It's not inconceiveable that the chancellor will reverse the 1p tax cut and say that the money saved will be spent on the health service instead.\" Even more daring will be if the Chancellor ditches the National Insurance contributions scheme altogether and merges it with income tax. But that would result in a basic rate of income tax of around 32p. </p> <p><strong>Pensions</strong> </p> <p>The Chancellor could axe the 40% higher-rate tax relief on pension contributions, reducing it to the new 22% basic rate, but with the government keen to launch stakeholder pensions from April 2001 it is unlikely to want to upset the pension tax regime too much. Instead he may use the opportunity to announce measures to ease the strict annuity rules, or play with the 25% tax-free lump sum on personal pensions. </p> <p><strong>ISAs</strong> </p> <p>The chancellor will hail individual savings accounts, initially derided as impossibly complex, as an unalloyed success. As a \"thank you\" to its supporters, he may well extend the \u00a37,000 first-year investment limit, due to come down to \u00a35,000 in 2000/01, for a further year.</p>",

Pensions The Chancellor could axe the 40% higher-rate tax relief on pension contributions, reducing it to the new 22% basic rate, but with the government keen to launch stakeholder pensions from April 2001 it is unlikely to want to upset the pension tax regime too much. Instead he may use the opportunity to announce measures to ease the strict annuity rules, or play with the 25% tax-free lump sum on personal pensions. ISAs The chancellor will hail individual savings accounts, initially derided as impossibly complex, as an unalloyed success. As a \"thank you\" to its supporters, he may well extend the \u00a37,000 first-year investment limit, due to come down to \u00a35,000 in 2000/01, for a further year.",

There were responses from Franco Donatoni, Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g, Heinz Holliger, Pierre Boulez, Oliver Knussen, Steven Mackey and from Harrison Birtwistle, who offered a trio of settings for soprano and cello of poems by the American Lorine Niedecker. The work of this elusive poet, who died in 1970, clearly struck a chord with Birtwistle, who has gone on to expand the set; the Nine Settings of Lorine Niedecker was given a superbly accomplished premiere in the Nash Ensemble's concert on Thursday by the soprano Valdine Anderson and the cellist Paul Watkins. </p> <p>Introducing the performance, Birtwistle likened the little pieces to drawings, compared with the large canvases of his major works. The crystalline observations of the haiku-like poems inhabit tightly circumscribed worlds, and Birtwistle preserves the fragility of the images in spare, unadorned lines. The voice and the cello float around each other, often in different tempi, so that the two lines are independent of each other yet curiously symbiotic. There are no big gestures: the text is unfolded, the cello perhaps comments elliptically, perhaps supports subliminally, and the poem is over. The whole set lasts less than 10 minutes. </p> <p>The Nash also performed a group of the Carter birthday tributes in their original miniaturised forms. They included the tiniest of musical paragraphs from Donatoni; a rhapsodic cello solo from Knussen containing enough musical ideas to spawn a much more substantial work; a noble, eloquent cor anglais solo from Kurt\u00e1g; and an elegant tracery for oboe and harp from Holliger. There was also a piece by the recipient himself, the Enchanted Preludes for flute and cello, in which the two instruments take hair-raisingly demanding journeys across ever-changing musical terrain, superbly negotiated by Watkins and Philippa Davies. </p> <p>Knussen's enchanted Songs Without Voices, four lyric impulses in which every note and colour glows, began the programme. Simon Holt's Sparrow Night, an evocation of a fearsome nocturnal vision taken from a Chekhov short story, ended it. The Purcell Room is a bit small for the acerbic collisions that Holt's writing generates, but the power of the music and the excellence of the performance under Martyn Brabbins came through powerfully enough.</p>",

There were responses from Franco Donatoni, Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g, Heinz Holliger, Pierre Boulez, Oliver Knussen, Steven Mackey and from Harrison Birtwistle, who offered a trio of settings for soprano and cello of poems by the American Lorine Niedecker. The work of this elusive poet, who died in 1970, clearly struck a chord with Birtwistle, who has gone on to expand the set; the Nine Settings of Lorine Niedecker was given a superbly accomplished premiere in the Nash Ensemble's concert on Thursday by the soprano Valdine Anderson and the cellist Paul Watkins. Introducing the performance, Birtwistle likened the little pieces to drawings, compared with the large canvases of his major works. The crystalline observations of the haiku-like poems inhabit tightly circumscribed worlds, and Birtwistle preserves the fragility of the images in spare, unadorned lines. The voice and the cello float around each other, often in different tempi, so that the two lines are independent of each other yet curiously symbiotic. There are no big gestures: the text is unfolded, the cello perhaps comments elliptically, perhaps supports subliminally, and the poem is over. The whole set lasts less than 10 minutes. The Nash also performed a group of the Carter birthday tributes in their original miniaturised forms. They included the tiniest of musical paragraphs from Donatoni; a rhapsodic cello solo from Knussen containing enough musical ideas to spawn a much more substantial work; a noble, eloquent cor anglais solo from Kurt\u00e1g; and an elegant tracery for oboe and harp from Holliger. There was also a piece by the recipient himself, the Enchanted Preludes for flute and cello, in which the two instruments take hair-raisingly demanding journeys across ever-changing musical terrain, superbly negotiated by Watkins and Philippa Davies. Knussen's enchanted Songs Without Voices, four lyric impulses in which every note and colour glows, began the programme. Simon Holt's Sparrow Night, an evocation of a fearsome nocturnal vision taken from a Chekhov short story, ended it. The Purcell Room is a bit small for the acerbic collisions that Holt's writing generates, but the power of the music and the excellence of the performance under Martyn Brabbins came through powerfully enough.",
