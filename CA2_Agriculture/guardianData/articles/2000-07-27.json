      "body": "<p>Memory has always been a key feature of Arthur Miller's work: either the collective memory of a nation or the haphazard one of an individual. But in this free-floating 80-minute piece, here getting its British premiere, it becomes the entire theme. </p> <p>The action takes place in the mind of Harry Peters: an ex-Pan Am pilot and Princeton lecturer who, in a derelict New York nightclub, conjures up figures from his past and present. We get to meet, in an echo of Death of a Salesman, his globe-trotting, wise-cracking brother and a blonde, voluptuous ex-lover called Cathy-May - a name that reminds you of Marilyn Monroe, christened Norma Jean. </p> <p>We watch, bemused and disengaged, as Miller's hero ruminates on the social upheavals of the American century, and searches for \"the subject\", the single idea that will make sense of his life. At last he seems to find it, through the character of a pregnant woman called Rose, in the love of a father for his child. </p> <p>Miller undeniably captures the discontinuous nature of aged memory. He also shows his gift for distilled aphorism: \"How like sex the trumpet is,\" mutters Harry at one point, \"it always leaves you kind of sad when it's finished.\" And Miller evokes an American past in which you never locked your front door and American presidents were morally righteous, \"rather than just entertaining\". </p> <p>The problem with the play lies in its form. The characters have no objective existence: they simply become figures in Harry's dream, which rules out external conflict or internal development. A black bag lady seated in the corner may symbolise Harry's marginalisation of a whole race: we never, however, get to hear her story.

      "bodyText": "Memory has always been a key feature of Arthur Miller's work: either the collective memory of a nation or the haphazard one of an individual. But in this free-floating 80-minute piece, here getting its British premiere, it becomes the entire theme. The action takes place in the mind of Harry Peters: an ex-Pan Am pilot and Princeton lecturer who, in a derelict New York nightclub, conjures up figures from his past and present. We get to meet, in an echo of Death of a Salesman, his globe-trotting, wise-cracking brother and a blonde, voluptuous ex-lover called Cathy-May - a name that reminds you of Marilyn Monroe, christened Norma Jean. We watch, bemused and disengaged, as Miller's hero ruminates on the social upheavals of the American century, and searches for \"the subject\", the single idea that will make sense of his life. At last he seems to find it, through the character of a pregnant woman called Rose, in the love of a father for his child. Miller undeniably captures the discontinuous nature of aged memory. He also shows his gift for distilled aphorism: \"How like sex the trumpet is,\" mutters Harry at one point, \"it always leaves you kind of sad when it's finished.\" And Miller evokes an American past in which you never locked your front door and American presidents were morally righteous, \"rather than just entertaining\". The problem with the play lies in its form. The characters have no objective existence: they simply become figures in Harry's dream, which rules out external conflict or internal development. A black bag lady seated in the corner may symbolise Harry's marginalisation of a whole race: we never, however, get to hear her story. Equally, Cathy-May is simply seen as a sex-object used and abused by men. How, one wonders, does she see herself? Running throughout the play is a vein of bullish locker-room sexism which Miller may record rather than endorse - but it is none the less dramatically limiting. Miller, at his best, documented the failure of the American Dream; here he is simply charting the time-bending dreams of an individual.

This was his Proms debut, and a packed Albert Hall was buzzing with excitement before he even stepped on to the platform. Huge cheers greeted his appearance and what followed was outstanding. </p> <p>His programme consisted of Beethoven's First Piano Concerto (with Lars Vogt as soloist) and Mahler's Sixth Symphony, both works subjected to a radical re-examination, their emotional content unforgettably exposed. Classicism slides into Romanticism in Beethoven's pivotal concerto. Jarvi and Vogt cover the widest stylistic and expressive range that I've ever heard in the work, kicking off with skittish, Mozartian elegance rather than the usual militaristic stiffness, then deepening and darkening the music as they go. </p> <p>The weighty limpidity of Vogt's playing brings with it a sudden, shocking pre-echo of Chopinesque chromaticism in the slow movement. The Dionysiac elation of the finale peers forward to Beethoven's own Fourth Symphony, then further on to Brahms. </p> <p>Jarvi's Mahler (like his father's) is powerhouse stuff, his version of the Sixth not so much a noble, tragic statement as a terrifying portrait of a world floundering on the edge of a void. The whole seems to reek of decay and rot. This is the last gasp of the Romantic revolution that Beethoven instigated. The symphony's so-called \"motto theme\", all pulverising brass and drums, first sneers at the rapturous emotions that surround it, then crushes them with ferocious brutality. </p> <p>The ludicrous minuet that forms the central section of the scherzo comes over as an obscene memory of imperial Vienna in its glory days. There's no peace anywhere, not even in the slow movement; its central theme is riddled with chromatic unease and never quite follows the melodic contours you expect. An overwhelming achievement: one of the great conducting careers of the 21st century is now, unquestionably, under way.</p>",

Jarvi and Vogt cover the widest stylistic and expressive range that I've ever heard in the work, kicking off with skittish, Mozartian elegance rather than the usual militaristic stiffness, then deepening and darkening the music as they go. The weighty limpidity of Vogt's playing brings with it a sudden, shocking pre-echo of Chopinesque chromaticism in the slow movement. The Dionysiac elation of the finale peers forward to Beethoven's own Fourth Symphony, then further on to Brahms. Jarvi's Mahler (like his father's) is powerhouse stuff, his version of the Sixth not so much a noble, tragic statement as a terrifying portrait of a world floundering on the edge of a void. The whole seems to reek of decay and rot. This is the last gasp of the Romantic revolution that Beethoven instigated. The symphony's so-called \"motto theme\", all pulverising brass and drums, first sneers at the rapturous emotions that surround it, then crushes them with ferocious brutality. The ludicrous minuet that forms the central section of the scherzo comes over as an obscene memory of imperial Vienna in its glory days. There's no peace anywhere, not even in the slow movement; its central theme is riddled with chromatic unease and never quite follows the melodic contours you expect. An overwhelming achievement: one of the great conducting careers of the 21st century is now, unquestionably, under way.",

If it's advice you're after, don't miss out on Sitcom Writing http://members.aol.com/dsimon9874. It features interviews with professional comedians, tips on how to structure your sitcom and sample sketches from Smack The Pony. Another invaluable resource is Writing for Performance www.kelly.mcmail.com. This is the most comprehensive sitcom site I've seen, offering an excellent guide to sitcom basics, transcripts of interviews with television producers, and contact details for 20 comedy production companies. If you're not sure that your script is ready to be sent to a producer, the Screenwriters' Workshop at www.lsw.org.uk may be the place for you. It has links to writing groups and offers a professional, paid-for, script evaluation service. If you think you'd benefit from taking an online course, take a look at TV Comedy College. For \u00a3100 you can buy six foundation units in comedy writing, taught by three experienced sitcom writers with impressive pedigrees. (A free sample module is available on request.) Finally, when you're working on your script and the words just won't flow, pay a visit to Tom's Comedy Quotes at http://tomsquotes.amhosting.net. This has inspirational quotes by the bucketful from those greats of the sitcom world, Cheers and Seinfeld. Another good place for kick-starting your creative juice pump is the TV Comedy Database, which has cast, production and episode details for more than 600 British sitcoms. Browsing through these programmes can be both depressing and invigorating. The chances of you coming up with something even half as wonderful as Fawlty Towers on your first attempt are extremely slim. But at least you'll be able to manage something funnier than Heartburn Hotel and Up Rising (two of the direst sitcoms it has ever been my misfortune to endure) simply by persuading a city gent to fall into a manhole when distracted by an attractive young lady.

You need a degree to be able to cast a vote under porpoise-enal repres repr, that election thing. Pot Rice will often be too soggy. Peter Reid has a monkey's heed, and as for that job that basically involves throwing parties for a living, well the mere mention of it usually brings us out in spots. But today, as Newcastle United decide to take their own fans to court in order to pursue missing costs from the Save Our Seats affair, the Fiver advises them to get some good public relations going. And quickly.</p> <p>The six Newcastle fans who lost an appeal against having their seats, which were guaranteed by club bonds, moved across St James's Park to make way for executive boxes have, like most losers, been asked to pay the legal costs for both sides. This total is estimated at \u00a3198,000, a whole \u00a380,000 more than the six were insured for. They claim they took out a policy based on estimates provided by the club, estimates that now prove to have been a little bit under. So naturally the only way for the club to get their money back (money which would pay Duncan Ferguson's wages for all of, ooh, a fortnight) is to head back to court.</p> <p>\"The board believes that the most appropriate way forward is to allow the matter to proceed to a costs hearing where the costs of the action payable by the claimants can be independently assessed by the court,\" read a heartfelt club statement today. \"Subsequent to this assessment the board of Newcastle United plc will then consider the determination of the court and consider what further actions, if any, should be taken.\" Jane Duffy, leader of the six, agreed at least in part: \"We believe that the final bill will be significantly less than \u00a380,000, but to be honest it could have been written off and that would have been the end of it. But now it just drags on and on.\" Anyone got a number for Max Clifford?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I was wrong and I think the team were wrong. It is a passionate game, especially in the Premiership, but we were definitely bang out of order. The manager said that and hopefully it will never happen again.\"</p> <p>Roy Keane finally apologises for his verbal assault on Andy D'Urso (about six months late). And we're sure it won't happen again either.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE YEAR OF THE FOX</strong></p> <p>\"Money, money, money, always honey. In a rich man's world!\" And which rich man's world is the Fiver talking about? San Tropez? Old Trafford? Anfield? Try Filbert Street. Because today Leicester chairman (or should that be foxy playboy?) John Elsom splashed out a club record \u00a35m on Wolves' Ade Akinbiyi, to take his total spending this summer over the \u00a310m mark.</p> <p>It may not sound like a lot in these days of \u00a337m transfers, but it is more than the parsimonious Peter Kenyon at Manchester United or David Moores at Liverpool have given their managers this pre-season. And the good news for Foxes fans (and other first division managers) is that he's ready to offload more dosh! \"It does not necessarily mean an end to the spending. We are going seriously into this season to be a very successful team,\" Elsom said in a fit of extravagance. The spendthrift! </p> <p>Or maybe not. Because Leicester manager Peter Taylor has obviously seen something in the 25 year-old Akinbiyi that Norwich, Hereford, Brighton, Gillingham, Bristol City and Wolves fans have all missed, claiming that the Nigerian international has been his prime target since ever since he became Leicester manager. \"I had a look at the players as soon as I got here and I wanted some pace and power - somebody who would score goals,\" Taylor said, conveniently forgetting about Akinbiyi's complete lack of a first touch. \"Ade fits the bill. He was always top of my list.\"</p> <p>The Fiver has certainly noticed his pace and power, but a look at Akinbiyi's goalscoring record in lower division football (207 appearances, 74 goals) doesn't exactly mark him out as a marksman on the Steve Bull scale. So until he proves us otherwise we reckon Taylor is probably only two-thirds right - although, as Meatloaf once pointed out, two out of three ain't bad.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Barcelona coach Llorenc Serra Ferrer has admitted that \"grave problems\" are threatening Boudewijn Zenden's proposed \u00a38m transfer to Lazio - although he hasn't said what they are. And Serra Ferrer added: \"I wouldn't have a problem if the deal collapsed and Zenden stayed here. He is still an interesting player.\" </p> <p>George Weah has left AC Milan and is expected to move to AS Roma in the next few days. </p> <p>Celtic manager Martin O'Neill wants to sign Manchester United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich on loan. United have turned down a permanent deal but Celtic are still waiting to see whether Sir Alex Ferguson will allow Bosnich to sign a three-month loan agreement.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p> The FA are seeking talks with the government to try and persuade them to limit the number of non-EU players in the English game. \"We believe a quota system is the right way forward,\" said FA spokesman Steve Double. \"Our proposal is that there should be a limit of two non-European Union players in the Premier League and one in the First Division.\" The news comes after the government said it was unlikely that a quota system on all foreign players being brought into Britain would be possible under the Treaty of Rome.</p> <p>Sunderland manager Peter Reid has signed Slovakian international Stanislav Varga for \u00a3875,000.</p> <p>Good news for Manchester City fans. Striker Shaun Goater's hopes of being fit for the start of the new season have increased with the news that his knee operation has been a success.</p> <p>Chelsea have blocked a request by the Nigerian FA for Celestine Babayaro to join a pre-Olympics training camp next month, but will not attempt to prevent him competing in the tournament.</p> <p>Arsenal defender Brian McGovern, a Republic of Ireland Under-21 international, has joined First Division Norwich on a month's loan with a view to a permanent transfer.</p> <p>Yugoslavia defender Sinisa Mihajlovic has retired from international football, telling Belgrade daily Sportski: \"The time has come to say goodbye and give young players a chance.\" </p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV: World football: Get hottest CONCACAF scoops here first.

This total is estimated at \u00a3198,000, a whole \u00a380,000 more than the six were insured for. They claim they took out a policy based on estimates provided by the club, estimates that now prove to have been a little bit under. So naturally the only way for the club to get their money back (money which would pay Duncan Ferguson's wages for all of, ooh, a fortnight) is to head back to court. \"The board believes that the most appropriate way forward is to allow the matter to proceed to a costs hearing where the costs of the action payable by the claimants can be independently assessed by the court,\" read a heartfelt club statement today. \"Subsequent to this assessment the board of Newcastle United plc will then consider the determination of the court and consider what further actions, if any, should be taken.\" Jane Duffy, leader of the six, agreed at least in part: \"We believe that the final bill will be significantly less than \u00a380,000, but to be honest it could have been written off and that would have been the end of it. But now it just drags on and on.\" Anyone got a number for Max Clifford? * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I was wrong and I think the team were wrong. It is a passionate game, especially in the Premiership, but we were definitely bang out of order. The manager said that and hopefully it will never happen again.\" Roy Keane finally apologises for his verbal assault on Andy D'Urso (about six months late). And we're sure it won't happen again either. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE YEAR OF THE FOX \"Money, money, money, always honey. In a rich man's world!\" And which rich man's world is the Fiver talking about? San Tropez? Old Trafford? Anfield? Try Filbert Street. Because today Leicester chairman (or should that be foxy playboy?) John Elsom splashed out a club record \u00a35m on Wolves' Ade Akinbiyi, to take his total spending this summer over the \u00a310m mark. It may not sound like a lot in these days of \u00a337m transfers, but it is more than the parsimonious Peter Kenyon at Manchester United or David Moores at Liverpool have given their managers this pre-season. And the good news for Foxes fans (and other first division managers) is that he's ready to offload more dosh! \"It does not necessarily mean an end to the spending. We are going seriously into this season to be a very successful team,\" Elsom said in a fit of extravagance. The spendthrift! Or maybe not. Because Leicester manager Peter Taylor has obviously seen something in the 25 year-old Akinbiyi that Norwich, Hereford, Brighton, Gillingham, Bristol City and Wolves fans have all missed, claiming that the Nigerian international has been his prime target since ever since he became Leicester manager. \"I had a look at the players as soon as I got here and I wanted some pace and power - somebody who would score goals,\" Taylor said, conveniently forgetting about Akinbiyi's complete lack of a first touch. \"Ade fits the bill. He was always top of my list.\" The Fiver has certainly noticed his pace and power, but a look at Akinbiyi's goalscoring record in lower division football (207 appearances, 74 goals) doesn't exactly mark him out as a marksman on the Steve Bull scale. So until he proves us otherwise we reckon Taylor is probably only two-thirds right - although, as Meatloaf once pointed out, two out of three ain't bad. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Barcelona coach Llorenc Serra Ferrer has admitted that \"grave problems\" are threatening Boudewijn Zenden's proposed \u00a38m transfer to Lazio - although he hasn't said what they are. And Serra Ferrer added: \"I wouldn't have a problem if the deal collapsed and Zenden stayed here. He is still an interesting player.\" George Weah has left AC Milan and is expected to move to AS Roma in the next few days. Celtic manager Martin O'Neill wants to sign Manchester United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich on loan. United have turned down a permanent deal but Celtic are still waiting to see whether Sir Alex Ferguson will allow Bosnich to sign a three-month loan agreement. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF The FA are seeking talks with the government to try and persuade them to limit the number of non-EU players in the English game. \"We believe a quota system is the right way forward,\" said FA spokesman Steve Double. \"Our proposal is that there should be a limit of two non-European Union players in the Premier League and one in the First Division.\" The news comes after the government said it was unlikely that a quota system on all foreign players being brought into Britain would be possible under the Treaty of Rome. Sunderland manager Peter Reid has signed Slovakian international Stanislav Varga for \u00a3875,000. Good news for Manchester City fans. Striker Shaun Goater's hopes of being fit for the start of the new season have increased with the news that his knee operation has been a success. Chelsea have blocked a request by the Nigerian FA for Celestine Babayaro to join a pre-Olympics training camp next month, but will not attempt to prevent him competing in the tournament. Arsenal defender Brian McGovern, a Republic of Ireland Under-21 international, has joined First Division Norwich on a month's loan with a view to a permanent transfer. Yugoslavia defender Sinisa Mihajlovic has retired from international football, telling Belgrade daily Sportski: \"The time has come to say goodbye and give young players a chance.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: World football: Get hottest CONCACAF scoops here first.

Press a buzzer on the side of the red door and you are in a dark but homely house, a warren of meeting rooms and offices. There are toys out for visiting children, cake in the fridge. But the curtains of the front room are permanently drawn to deter brick throwers, death threats or irate husbands with sawn-off shotguns.</p> <p>Welcome to a unique institution in British radical life, black life, feminist life. This month, Southall Black Sisters celebrated their 21st anniversary. \"Oh yes,\" said a friend in instant recognition. \"They save women, don't they?\"</p> <p>It's easy to see what she means. Over the past two decades, Southall Black Sisters have mobilised some of the most public and poignant campaigns in defence of women jailed for killing violent or abusive men. When Kiranjit Ahluwalia was released from prison in 1992, after the court agreed she had killed her violent husband in a final act of survival, she came to SBS to say thank you. She couldn't believe her eyes, says Pragna Patel. \"When she saw that we were so few, she said, how do you do it? How does an organisation with such a big persona operate on such small reserves?\"</p> <p>One answer is commitment, sheer hard work. Southall Black Sisters have four full-time workers, three of whom are funded by Ealing Council, the fourth by a group of charities. Their small offices are cramped, the phone rings constantly. A thousand women a year come knocking on their door, many fleeing domestic violence and the problems it throws up: homelessness, benefits, racial violence, difficulties with immigration status.</p> <p>\"This is no ordinary nine to five job,\" Patel says. \"The workers are so busy dealing with women during the day, the only time they can do their paperwork and administration is in the evenings or at weekends.\"</p> <p>In addition Patel, who has recently completed the academic stage of a solicitor's qualification, reckons she and the other committee members give to Southall Black Sisters \"between 50% and 70% of our working time, mostly unpaid\". What motivates these women is \"a sense of belonging, of confidence, a sense that here we are our true selves\".</p> <p>Patel, 39, has been involved with Southall Black Sisters since 1982, but there is a younger generation coming up now, among them Anita Johal, 30. \"I came to Southall Black Sisters because I wanted to put in a wider context what had happened to me. I had done a masters in law in relation to race and immigration, yet I had been in a violent relationship myself. That was a cruel irony, to be theoretically studying the issues and yet, in reality, facing them. This job has politicised me, no doubt.\"</p> <p>Southall Black Sisters emerged from the 1979 clashes between anti-racist youth and fascists in Southall, the ferment that killed the white teacher Blair Peach. Black women's groups were springing up in many cities but according to Nira Yuval-Davis, professor in gender and ethnic studies at the University of Greenwich, SBS never drowned in what was once fashionable identity politics. \"They had enough of a grounding in their own position to be open to other feminists and to work towards shared goals and visions.\"</p> <p>As an example of this, she cites a 1984 demonstration outside the house of a young woman driven to suicide by her violent husband. Patel recalls how, after the first ever march through Southall against domestic violence, \"we adopted the methods of the Indian women's movement, by standing silently outside. A lot of the women were disguised as they had left the area already because of domestic violence. They were incredibly brave.\" A white socialist feminist academic ran the cr\u00e8che.</p> <p>Since then, Southall Black Sisters have worked with an array of groups to secure the freedom of women like Kiranjit Ahluwalia or Zoora Shah, the non-literate Muslim woman who, in 1992, murdered the man who had waged a campaign of physical and sexual terror against her. Shah remains in prison; Rahila Gupta, a member of Southall Black Sisters since 1989, is writing a play about her.</p> <p>According to Gupta: \"We have always been under attack for washing our dirty linen in public, not just from traditional conservatives but from the black left in general. We are accused of fuelling racist stereotypes.\" She pauses. \"This is the big question we are always asking ourselves - how to present a public face without being considered counterproductive.\"</p> <p>The question was particularly pertinent in both the Rushdie and Tyson affairs. Southall Black Sisters tried to find a political way, often at great personal risk, between what they saw as white racist stereotypes and a failure in the black community to examine honestly its attitudes towards women.</p> <p>But public success and a changed political climate have brought new difficulties, Patel says. \"We were used to oppositional politics under Thatcher and Major. With Blair, there's a feeling that we should seize the moment and see if we can have a positive influence on the institutions.\" One of their biggest recent successes was to get the government to drop the notorious one year rule, which left women newly arrived in this country, who had fled violent marriages, with no immigration status. Now such women are allowed to stay indefinitely.</p> <p>The group is also often asked to talk to senior police officers about race and domestic violence. At one seminar, Johal says: \"They had to sit and listen to us for a whole day. Wonderful!\"</p> <p>The price of inclusion is not always so pleasurable. Having lobbied hard to make sure the working party on forced marriages consulted a wider range of women's groups, Southall Black Sisters member Hannana Siddiqui resigned from the working party last month in protest at its support for mediation as a viable option for women in forced marriages.</p> <p>Yuval-Davis says: \"Southall Black Sisters have come to represent some kind of ideal to black feminist activists. But I don't see them as unique so much as the better expression of a wider trend, a trend of self-assertion that has taken root in both the urban centres of Britain and globally. It is the kind of politics that was evident at Beijing where often the best organised groups were not led by western white feminists.\"</p> <p>Think global, act local. In their own community, 21 years may not have brought respectability but they have finally brought a measure of acceptance to this extraordinary group of women. \"In the early stages,\" Patel says, \"the community was much more hostile. We would be hassled in the street, called prostitutes, home-wreckers and lesbians. But the community has had to acknowledge that we exist. They may or may not like us but they can no longer deny us.\"</p>",

And clearly convinced that there are plenty of like-minded customers out there with money to burn, it has launched what it claims is the \"most expensive cigarette in the world\". At \u00a318 for a packet of 20, Treasurer cigarettes are great if expense is your reason to quit. In the quest to create the \"utmost smoking pleasure\" no expense has been spared. From the aluminium/silver tip, to the watermarked paper, this is a very exclusive cigarette indeed. While the tobacco connoisseur will no doubt appreciate the \"nutty ... fulsome flavour\" achieved through a blend of Virginia tobacco with a small percentage of Burley, the doyen of good taste will be slightly less enamoured with the choice of silver packaging. To describe it as \"tacky\" would be harsh, but the ultimate in sophistication? I don't think so. Harrods, Selfridges, The Davidoff Shop, St James's. Call 01626 866 422 for stockist information.",

The Asda Wal-Mart Supercentre Patchway, to give it its fully merged name, appears to be the place to go when you have \u00a315.98 and you need a gazebo. The Wal-Mart concept, like the joke, does not translate perfectly. </p> <p>Visitors hoping to find a treasure trove of genuine American rubbish - confections of celebratory disgustingness, perhaps, or Confederate flag windscreen stickers - will be disappointed. The \"Taste of America\" range is actually rather cautious: outsize doughnuts, ribs, some chocolate muffins, a slim selection of baseball mitts (no lefties) and a few bags of Fireside marshmallows. Even the Wal-Mart name keeps a low profile, apart from the gigantic banner lashed to the side of the building. </p> <p>\"Greeters\" guard the two entrances, their attentions difficult, if not impossible, to avoid. Once inside, it's difficult to take in the expanse: 100,000 square feet of shopping prairie, with a cafe at one end, clothing (and fitting rooms) at the other, and everything else in between. The staff even use scooters to get around the site. </p> <p>One feature of the new Wal-Mart experience gets old very quickly: the PA system. Every 10 minutes or so, Neil the greeter grabs the microphone, introduces himself and welcomes you to the store.

The wine section is particularly impressive, with bottles of Australian white which might set you back \u00a35 in a late-night off licence selling for \u00a32.29, alongside reds in the \u00a320 to \u00a330 range. The expensive wines are laid out in wooden cases, which is a nice surprise, given that in my local Sainsbury they're kept under lock and key. Elsewhere there is posh balsamic vinegar and grand olive oils with price tags to match, as well as bargain vegetable oils in unfeasibly large containers. Sometimes the mix is uncomfortable: a rather cosmopolitan variety of Chinese and Indian takeaways are available in ready-packed sacks at the front of the store, but the ingredients to make such dishes are tucked away in an aisle unappetisingly marked \"foreign food\". </p> <p>The eye tends to strays to signs advertising absurd bargains - this is a Wal-Mart, after all. Basic sliced white is a mere 15p a loaf, the new Harry Potter is \u00a39.87 (list price \u00a314.99, although Amazon has it for \u00a38.99) and butter can be had for as little as 45p. </p> <p>The store aims to undercut its rivals by an average of 10% - 15%, but some of the reductions are a little stingy - organic wild rocket: was 77p, now 76p - and with the overwhelming selection before you (there are dozens of varieties of everything) it becomes impossible to recall what one normally pays for anything. </p> <p>Food is only half the story of the Asda-Wal-Mart experience. Just one aisle past the middle you suddenly find yourself surrounded by camping equipment, mobile phones, CDs, vacuum cleaners, toys, toasters, microwaves, bicycles, a pharmacy, an optician, prams, shoes, paint, video cameras and power tools. This half is where the crowds tend to form, looking at the exercise treadmills and music systems on display. This is where parents pushing \"Bobby Buggies\" - two-seater toy cars mounted on flat-bed trolleys, with the shopping basket at the back - tend to pull over and block traffic so they can shout at their children. </p> <p>There's no doubt that everything is cheaper, some of it a lot cheaper, but the quality can vary alarmingly. The half-price scooters are but a flimsy imitation of the best-selling model. The non-Black and Decker workbench, which costs \u00a39.98, is suspicious, although the real McCoy sits on a higher shelf, conspicuously unpriced (they normally go for about \u00a389). Is Wal-Mart really the place to buy golf clubs, or a swimming costume, or a circular saw? </p> <p>Cheap or not, if you're an impulse shopper, things could get very expensive very quickly. Just under \u00a3500 may be a very reasonable price for an exercise treadmill, but will it fit in the back of the Volvo? </p> <p>After an hour or so the novelty of the place begins to wear off, as one succumbs to selection fatigue. There is just too much stuff, spread over too many square feet. </p> <p>The prices are undoubtedly low, in some cases the lowest in the land. The \"colleagues\" are preposterously helpful and the Asda-Wal-Mart hybrid is nowhere near as charmless as its American cousin, but for the customer the sheer size of the place is a nuisance. </p> <p>Over the course of the afternoon I was bewitched, bothered and bewildered, not necessarily in that order, but by the end I was longing for a nice little high street.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Dome Europe, a Japanese-led consortium, has won the competition to take over the troubled Millennium Dome, it was announced today.</p> <p>Making the announcement, Cabinet Office minister Lord Falconer of Thoroton said the dome had secured its future. Lord Falconer praised the dome as a \"model for future regeneration schemes\" that had created 30,000 jobs, although the project has been pilloried ever since its opening at the end of last year.</p> <p>Dome Europe wants to retain the venue as a tourist attraction featuring virtual reality computer games, a Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\" and interactive art galleries. Dome Europe believes it could attract 6m visitors a year - the same number as is now estimated will visit the current exhibition before the end of the year.</p> <p>Dome Europe said that it planned to continue with the dome's current price structure, which means a single adult ticket will cost \u00a320 and five-person family tickets will cost \u00a357.</p> <p>But the company added that there will be a one-year season ticket, priced initially at \u00a330.

      "bodyText": "Dome Europe, a Japanese-led consortium, has won the competition to take over the troubled Millennium Dome, it was announced today. Making the announcement, Cabinet Office minister Lord Falconer of Thoroton said the dome had secured its future. Lord Falconer praised the dome as a \"model for future regeneration schemes\" that had created 30,000 jobs, although the project has been pilloried ever since its opening at the end of last year. Dome Europe wants to retain the venue as a tourist attraction featuring virtual reality computer games, a Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\" and interactive art galleries. Dome Europe believes it could attract 6m visitors a year - the same number as is now estimated will visit the current exhibition before the end of the year. Dome Europe said that it planned to continue with the dome's current price structure, which means a single adult ticket will cost \u00a320 and five-person family tickets will cost \u00a357. But the company added that there will be a one-year season ticket, priced initially at \u00a330. Dome Europe said Nomura, the Japanese financial group, had underwritten about \u00a3400m to support the plans and that Dome Europe's development partners would spend a further \u00a3400m on the site. \"This is a great day,\" said Guy Hands, managing director of Nomura International's principal finance group. The consortium is taking over a troubled venture. The dome has failed to meet projections for visitors and the \u00a3800m project has had to ask for extra government cash to keep going. It has raised only \u00a385m in commercial income so far this year - less than half a predicted income revenue of \u00a3194m - because total spending by visitors is now expected to be less than half what was originally forecast. In its third annual report, the New Millennium Experience Company, which runs the Greenwich site, blamed the financial difficulties on the strong pound and \"negative media coverage\". The report predicted that without a change in circumstances the dome was likely to need extra funding to remain open until the end of the year. The warning came despite the award of \u00a329m from the National Lottery in May, which came on top of the \u00a3496m of lottery funds already committed to the dome. The NMEC's 74-page report released earlier this month revealed that the dome's total income over this year is now estimated to be \u00a3761m, with another \u00a33m set aside to promote and market the attraction. The significant reduction in the estimates of commercial income reflect the halving of the paying visitor target from 12m to 6m. The accounts indicate that the original \u00a3399m of lottery money received by NMEC had now risen to a net figure of \u00a3525m, including the additional grants of \u00a360m in February and \u00a329m in May. The company report, which covers the last nine months of 1999, also revealed details of the pay deals of senior staff. Jennie Page, the former chief executive, received severance pay of \u00a3178,983 - more than her annual \u00a3150,000 salary - when she was forced out in February, while the operations director, Ken Robinson, who resigned his \u00a3184,000 post in the same month, received a pay-off worth \u00a3147,025.",

Kodak sponsorship has enabled PBS to build a bigger site than usual but the pictures are still too small. Other new PBS sites continue the theme of presenting the American Experience Online.

We have to be prudent in the way we go about our business.\" Murray also revealed how he agreed personal terms with Schalke forward Emile Mpenza, but the deal fell through because the German side rejected his \u00a38m offer. \"I know that Mpenza had his heart set on joining us, but there is nothing more we can do,\" Murray admitted. \"We worked hard on this and I thought we were winning, but in business you have to take the good with the bad.\" Benito Carbone looks set to rejoin former club Reggina reports Planet Football. But they say the Italian team may face late opposition from Bayern Munich, who have \"made a late entrance into the race to sign the skilful star.\" Arsenal winger Marc Overmars has denied reports that he has already signed a pre-contract agreement to join Barcelona. \"I've done no such thing and frankly I find such a hilarious lie ridiculous.\" claimed the Dutch winger. His agent Karel Jansen was quick to support him: \"It is complete rubbish to suggest Marc has signed an agreement with anybody. There has been no contact from Barcelona with us about Marc.\" Sheffield Wednesday are eyeing Blackburn winger Keith Gillespie and Grimsby right-back Danny Butterfield reports the Express",

The engine that failed was the same one which had undergone repairs before the supersonic jetliner took off, Air France has revealed. Thirty minutes of repair work was needed on the left-hand side number two engine because of a reverse thruster problem. Less than a minute after the plane took off, flames were seen coming out of the New York-bound plane. The Concorde's short flight was captured on a piece of harrowing amateur video footage taken from a vehicle moving down a nearby motorway. It shows the plane trailing a flame twice its length as it banks away from view. The nose of the airliner is raised slightly above the body but the underbelly is clearly descending towards the earth. Behind the craft, corkscrew-shaped clouds of thick black smoke emerge from the plane's trail of yellow flame. Moments after the Concorde disappears from view, a huge cloud of black smoke billows up from the ground.

Has anyone done better than this?</strong> asks Rod McGreevy </p> <p>There are quite a few instances of a bowler taking six wickets in a six-ball over, so I'm afraid it's not quite a record, although it is a remarkable performance and must have been fun. It certainly should have impressed the students! The record for all cricket is believed to be nine wickets in consecutive balls, which has been reported twice - by a P Hugo in a club match in Johannesburg in 1930-31, and Stephen Fleming in a school match in New Zealand in 1967-68 (no, not the current New Zealand captain: he wasn't born until 1973). In first-class cricket three bowlers - Derbyshire's Bill Copson (1937), WA Henderson of NE Transvaal (1937-38) and Surrey's Pat Pocock (1972) - have taken five wickets in six balls. Charlie Parker, the Gloucestershire slow left-arm bowler who won one England cap, hit the stumps with five successive deliveries during his benefit match against Yorkshire at Bristol in 1922 ... unfortunately the second one was a no-ball. </p> <p> <strong> What do you think is the greatest record - the most unbreakable one?</strong> asks Alex Roberts </p> <p>Until a few years ago I'd have said that Hanif Mohammad's innings of 499 would never be exceeded, but Brian Lara knocked that off in 1994. Equally it's hard to see anyone bettering Jim Laker's 19 for 90 in a Test, but it is possible. But two marks which surely will never be broken are the aggregate records - Jack Hobbs's 61,237 runs and Wilfred Rhodes's 4187 wickets in first-class cricket. The seasonal marks of Denis Compton (3816 runs) and Tich Freeman (304 wickets) are also safe. There just aren't enough first-class matches these days for anyone to approach any of these. In Test cricket, however, the opposite is true: so much is played these days that all the aggregate records are held by current or recently retired players.</p> <p><strong> With which county did Ian Botham start his first-class career?</strong> asks Peter Darling </p> <p>Botham joined Somerset after a spell on the MCC cricket staff at Lord's, and made his debut for them in 1974, three years before the first of his 102 Test appearances. After objecting to Somerset's decision to release Viv Richards and Joel Garner, Beefy moved to Worcestershire in 1987 then, in a move he later regretted, he played for Durham in 1992 and 1993, their first two years as a first-class county.</p> <p> <strong> I am the great-great-great-grandson of Tom Armitage, the Yorkshire cricketer who played in the first Test of all in Australia in 1876-77. What information do you have about him?</strong> asks Lindsay Toulson </p> <p>Tom Armitage was born in Walkley, Sheffield, on April 25, 1848. He was primarily a batsman, but also had some success as a bowler, often with underarm lobs - he took 13 for 46 with them in the match for Yorkshire v Surrey at Sheffield in 1876, a few months before he played in the first two Test matches, at Melbourne in March 1877. He didn't take a wicket, and had scores of 9 and 3 in the first Test (which Australia won) and 21 as England won the second game. In all first-class matches (1872-79) he scored 1122 runs at an average of 13.35, and took 119 wickets (14.27). He later moved to America, to do some cricket coaching, and died in Chicago on Sept 21, 1922.</p> <p> <strong> Is it possible to access the Laws of Cricket on the web?</strong> asks Jo Clark </p> <p>The Laws have just been redrafted by MCC, and you can access the new code on the Lord's website by <a href=\"http://www-uk5.cricket.org/link_to_database/NATIONAL/ENG/CLUBS/MCC/nws_0023537.html\">clicking here</a></p> <p><strong> Is there any record of a player named Kris Padman having played for India, or any first-class cricket in India? I can't find him, so thought I'd ask the experts, </strong> says Jason Keane </p> <p>No-one of that exact name has played in Tests or one-dayers for India. It might just be a gentleman called Karumanaseri Narayanaiyer Ananthapadmanabhan, a right-hand batsman and legspinner who plays for Kerala. I expect their scorer uses a shortened version of his name!</p> <p> <strong> What's the name of that cartoon duck which appears when a player makes 0 in Australia?</strong> asks Steve Hewitt </p> <p>The cartoon character who waddles across the bottom of the screen on Australia's Channel 9 when a batsman makes 0 is called \"Daddles the Duck\". </p> <p> <strong> I recently bought the 2000 Wisden Almanack (which I'm greatly enjoying), and in it I've come across several glowing references to the \"centenary\" Almanack of 1963. How should I go about obtaining a copy?</strong> asks John Rawlinson </p> <p>You might well be able to track down a copy on the internet, using one of the searchable book sites like amazon.co.uk or Barnes &amp; Noble. I looked just now and found one on Amazon for \u00a340 and one on bn.com for $65 (it's an American site!). Alternatively you could contact a specialist cricket-book dealer, a list of which appears in Wisden each year - in the 2000 book it's on page 1565. You should try two or three of them to find the best price.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

With which county did Ian Botham start his first-class career? asks Peter Darling Botham joined Somerset after a spell on the MCC cricket staff at Lord's, and made his debut for them in 1974, three years before the first of his 102 Test appearances. After objecting to Somerset's decision to release Viv Richards and Joel Garner, Beefy moved to Worcestershire in 1987 then, in a move he later regretted, he played for Durham in 1992 and 1993, their first two years as a first-class county. I am the great-great-great-grandson of Tom Armitage, the Yorkshire cricketer who played in the first Test of all in Australia in 1876-77. What information do you have about him? asks Lindsay Toulson Tom Armitage was born in Walkley, Sheffield, on April 25, 1848. He was primarily a batsman, but also had some success as a bowler, often with underarm lobs - he took 13 for 46 with them in the match for Yorkshire v Surrey at Sheffield in 1876, a few months before he played in the first two Test matches, at Melbourne in March 1877. He didn't take a wicket, and had scores of 9 and 3 in the first Test (which Australia won) and 21 as England won the second game. In all first-class matches (1872-79) he scored 1122 runs at an average of 13.35, and took 119 wickets (14.27). He later moved to America, to do some cricket coaching, and died in Chicago on Sept 21, 1922. Is it possible to access the Laws of Cricket on the web? asks Jo Clark The Laws have just been redrafted by MCC, and you can access the new code on the Lord's website by clicking here Is there any record of a player named Kris Padman having played for India, or any first-class cricket in India? I can't find him, so thought I'd ask the experts, says Jason Keane No-one of that exact name has played in Tests or one-dayers for India. It might just be a gentleman called Karumanaseri Narayanaiyer Ananthapadmanabhan, a right-hand batsman and legspinner who plays for Kerala. I expect their scorer uses a shortened version of his name! What's the name of that cartoon duck which appears when a player makes 0 in Australia? asks Steve Hewitt The cartoon character who waddles across the bottom of the screen on Australia's Channel 9 when a batsman makes 0 is called \"Daddles the Duck\". I recently bought the 2000 Wisden Almanack (which I'm greatly enjoying), and in it I've come across several glowing references to the \"centenary\" Almanack of 1963. How should I go about obtaining a copy? asks John Rawlinson You might well be able to track down a copy on the internet, using one of the searchable book sites like amazon.co.uk or Barnes &amp; Noble. I looked just now and found one on Amazon for \u00a340 and one on bn.com for $65 (it's an American site!). Alternatively you could contact a specialist cricket-book dealer, a list of which appears in Wisden each year - in the 2000 book it's on page 1565. You should try two or three of them to find the best price. Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

In another attempt to distance himself from Mr Hague, Lord Brittan reassured Danish pro-Europeans that many Tories favoured British membership of the euro. Lord Brittan said: \"I want to make it clear that there are many British Conservatives who favour the United Kingdom's membership of the euro and believe that it is for the people of Denmark to make up their minds on this issue.\" A spokesman for Mr Hague declined to respond to Lord Brittan's remarks.",

He said on Tuesday that one reason for the likely delay is the degree of opposition from the government and other European capitals, which means that the $60bn deployment might not be able to take place until after the target date of 2005. Tony Blair and foreign secretary Robin Cook have been pressing the US, in the words of one minister, not to indulge \"in gung-ho unilateralism\". The Foreign Office minister Peter Hain has told the US state department the British government will come under intense political pressure if deployment goes ahead. Behind the scenes, Britain has been urging the US to keep talking to the Russians, fearing that unilateral deployment by the US would breach of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty and trigger a new arms race. Foreign Office sources said Bill Clinton and Tony Blair had been impressed by first hand reports from Vladimir Putin that North Korea wants to avoid confrontation with the US.

      "body": "<p>The novelist Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite, who has died aged 74, was one of the generation that had to make their way in the dismal Spain of the post-civil war years, a country particularly hostile to independent women. In doing so, she helped change the face of Spanish literature and lay the basis for the resurgence in the 1970s of a new generation of readers.</p> <p>To the reforming realist generation of the 1950s, including such writers as her ex-husband Rafael S\u00e1nchez Ferlosio and Ignacio Aldecoa, Mart\u00edn Gaite added a particular sense of psychological depth. Included in this loose group of Madrid writers were two women, Josefina Aldecoa and Ana Mar\u00eda Matute, who became her lifelong intimate friends.</p> <p>The daughter of an affluent, liberal family, Mart\u00edn Gaite was born in Salamanca, and graduated in romance philology from Madrid University when very few women were able to do so - at her death, she was one of only two women members of the Spanish Royal Academy. She became known for her short novel, the nightmarish El balneario (The Spa), in 1954, and won the Nadal Prize in 1957 for Entre visillos (Among Anti-macassars), in which she showed a characteristic domination of colloquial language. In both 1978 and 1994 she won the National Literature Prize, and in 1988 the Prince of Asturias Prize.</p> <p>Indeed, as the young writer Bel\u00e9n Gopegui observed, she won every possible prize in Spanish literature except those which were fixed - in which she refused to participate. For Mart\u00edn Gaite was a writer of rare principle. She was not someone to shout her opinions in a literary world full of loud voices, but discreetly showed who she was in deeds - agreeing to speak at a public library threatened by closure or refusing to lend her name to establishment institutions.</p> <p>She was also a voracious reader, who never refused to help other writers. Juan Jos\u00e9 Millas, Marcos Giralt, Soledad Pu\u00e9rtolas and Bel\u00e9n Gopegui are just some of the younger novelists whose careers were pushed forward by Mart\u00edn Gaite's acute criticism and generosity. As well as a dozen novels, Mart\u00edn Gaite wrote short stories, historical essays, literary criticism, social commentary - such as a famous 1987 book on Usos amorosos de la post-guerra espa\u00f1ola (Post-war Love Customs) - and translations.</p> <p>Two novels have been published in English, Variable Cloud (1995) and The Farewell Angel (1999). The former, commonly thought the finest of her later books, added massive sales to her literary renown. Indeed, her three novels of the 1990s each sold over 300,000 copies.</p> <p>Variable Cloud is the story of two childhood friends who had lost their friendship by a divergence of paths, exacerbated by sexual rivalry, but in middle-age crisis meet by chance at a party. Both are stimulated by the reunion to write down their stories, one in letters, the other in a journal. The novel is a paean to the curative effect of explaining the present by writing down the past, and not just secretly, but for another: literature as friendship. Gradually both women find solace in writing. Their troubles are not diminished, nor swept away, but held at bay by the triumphant renewal of their friendship.</p> <p>Mart\u00edn Gaite explores meticulously the inner lives of her protagonists, making few concessions to her readers: the themes are complex and the inner monologue abundant. Yet this long novel is very readable because of the smoothness and beauty of her style - not for nothing was she translator into Spanish of Madame Bovary - and a number of vivid secondary characters who bring wit and act as a chorus on the plights of the two women.</p> <p>Mart\u00edn Gaite wrote psychological novels, but always strongly pinned by a realist social context. Friendship was not just the theme of Mart\u00edn Gaite's novels, but the passion, along with literature, of her life. Constantly active, unafraid to talk unguardedly, endowed with the gift of friendship, her open personality became a model for younger women of how to face life and take from it everything it has to give by herself giving generously.</p> <p>And, despite early success, she was not pampered by ease and privilege: her long struggles in her career under Franco - she was already 50 when he died - were added to by the failure of her marriage and the death of her only child, her daughter Marta, in 1985. She dedicated her novel Lo raro es vivir (How Strange It Is To Live) to a friend who \"always poked her head out among ruins and mistakes with her smile of light\".</p> <p>Mart\u00edn Gaite's frank stare and open smile of light - in her art and her life - taught her readers how to understand their own ruins and mistakes. She had been working right up to her death from a cancer diagnosed only in June.</p> <p>Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite, writer, born 1925; died July 23 2000</p>",

To the reforming realist generation of the 1950s, including such writers as her ex-husband Rafael S\u00e1nchez Ferlosio and Ignacio Aldecoa, Mart\u00edn Gaite added a particular sense of psychological depth. Included in this loose group of Madrid writers were two women, Josefina Aldecoa and Ana Mar\u00eda Matute, who became her lifelong intimate friends. The daughter of an affluent, liberal family, Mart\u00edn Gaite was born in Salamanca, and graduated in romance philology from Madrid University when very few women were able to do so - at her death, she was one of only two women members of the Spanish Royal Academy. She became known for her short novel, the nightmarish El balneario (The Spa), in 1954, and won the Nadal Prize in 1957 for Entre visillos (Among Anti-macassars), in which she showed a characteristic domination of colloquial language. In both 1978 and 1994 she won the National Literature Prize, and in 1988 the Prince of Asturias Prize. Indeed, as the young writer Bel\u00e9n Gopegui observed, she won every possible prize in Spanish literature except those which were fixed - in which she refused to participate. For Mart\u00edn Gaite was a writer of rare principle. She was not someone to shout her opinions in a literary world full of loud voices, but discreetly showed who she was in deeds - agreeing to speak at a public library threatened by closure or refusing to lend her name to establishment institutions. She was also a voracious reader, who never refused to help other writers. Juan Jos\u00e9 Millas, Marcos Giralt, Soledad Pu\u00e9rtolas and Bel\u00e9n Gopegui are just some of the younger novelists whose careers were pushed forward by Mart\u00edn Gaite's acute criticism and generosity. As well as a dozen novels, Mart\u00edn Gaite wrote short stories, historical essays, literary criticism, social commentary - such as a famous 1987 book on Usos amorosos de la post-guerra espa\u00f1ola (Post-war Love Customs) - and translations. Two novels have been published in English, Variable Cloud (1995) and The Farewell Angel (1999). The former, commonly thought the finest of her later books, added massive sales to her literary renown. Indeed, her three novels of the 1990s each sold over 300,000 copies. Variable Cloud is the story of two childhood friends who had lost their friendship by a divergence of paths, exacerbated by sexual rivalry, but in middle-age crisis meet by chance at a party. Both are stimulated by the reunion to write down their stories, one in letters, the other in a journal. The novel is a paean to the curative effect of explaining the present by writing down the past, and not just secretly, but for another: literature as friendship. Gradually both women find solace in writing. Their troubles are not diminished, nor swept away, but held at bay by the triumphant renewal of their friendship. Mart\u00edn Gaite explores meticulously the inner lives of her protagonists, making few concessions to her readers: the themes are complex and the inner monologue abundant. Yet this long novel is very readable because of the smoothness and beauty of her style - not for nothing was she translator into Spanish of Madame Bovary - and a number of vivid secondary characters who bring wit and act as a chorus on the plights of the two women. Mart\u00edn Gaite wrote psychological novels, but always strongly pinned by a realist social context. Friendship was not just the theme of Mart\u00edn Gaite's novels, but the passion, along with literature, of her life. Constantly active, unafraid to talk unguardedly, endowed with the gift of friendship, her open personality became a model for younger women of how to face life and take from it everything it has to give by herself giving generously. And, despite early success, she was not pampered by ease and privilege: her long struggles in her career under Franco - she was already 50 when he died - were added to by the failure of her marriage and the death of her only child, her daughter Marta, in 1985. She dedicated her novel Lo raro es vivir (How Strange It Is To Live) to a friend who \"always poked her head out among ruins and mistakes with her smile of light\". Mart\u00edn Gaite's frank stare and open smile of light - in her art and her life - taught her readers how to understand their own ruins and mistakes. She had been working right up to her death from a cancer diagnosed only in June. Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite, writer, born 1925; died July 23 2000",

      "bodyText": "Extracts of Philip Gould's memo of October 4, Strategic Choices On Europe: Great divide in Britain: The great obstacle to building a sustainable majority for the euro is the fundamental divide that runs through the country on Europe. One will never create anything like a national consensus on the euro, except perhaps after joing in the single currency. Opponents of the euro can get major traction by emphasising the threat to sovereignty and British control of its own future. Conservative opportunity: For the Conservatives, the Europe issue is a life preserver. They have fallen to 24% of the vote, and William Hague has failed to win the public's confidence. But by grasping hold of Europe, the Tories can make themselves relevant and more electable. If Labour attempts to marginalise the Tories by attacking their position as extreme - in effect, a brand of Thatcherism that is hostile to Europe - Labour loses the argument. More voters at this point are inclined to believe the opposite charge: that Labour is extreme, determined to abandon the pound and create a European superstate.",

It is the third dramatic leak direct from the prime minister's office and suggests the government is still exposed to an organised and unprecedented attempt to destroy its business. Privately, ministers admit they are prey to a form of paralysis until the source of the leaks is identified. Mr Blair's aides claimed the memo revealed nothing he had not said already in public. The memo, leaked like the others to the Sun and the Times, quoted Mr Blair as saying the government needed to be \"firmer, more certain, clearer\" on the euro, but stressed that the economic conditions had to be right first. However, Mr Blair's pollster, Philip Gould, has also warned the prime minister that if he attempts to portray William Hague and his anti-Europeanism as extremist he will lose the argument. The latest leaked memo was timed to distract attention from the government's National Plan for Health, to be unveiled today. Downing Street last night recognised the damage of the memo but claimed voters would begin to realise that leaks were part of a coordinated attempt to distract attention from major long-term policy announcements. Senior executives at News International, which owns the Sun and Times, insisted they were not complicit in a conspiracy to reveal leaks at a time designed to distract attention from the government's big spending announcements. The previous damaging leaks were published immediately before and after the government annnouncements of big spending increases for public services. The Guardian yesterday quoted reliable sources alleging that the publicist Max Clifford was the go-between in a series of leaks of memos from Mr Blair and Mr Gould. It said that he was responsible for the placing of the leaks after the documents were recovered by Benjamin Pell, nicknamed Benji the Binman because of his habit of rummaging through the waste bins of the rich and famous. The same sources also told the Guardian on Tuesday that a further leak was likely to be printed in the Sun and the Times today to deflect media attention from the announcement of the government's NHS reform plans. The health plan will be published today and is expected to include tough controls on consultant's contracts, especially new consultants. In the latest leaked memo, Mr Gould says any attempt to portray the Tories as extreme will backfire. \"If Labour attempts to marginalise the Tories by attacking their position as extreme - in effect a brand of Thatcherism - Labour loses the argument.

Instead they spend two or three weeks a year driving to airports in pursuit of their hobby and have amassed an archive of thousand of aircraft shots.</p> <p>A spokesman for Reuters said the company would not discuss how much Mr Kisgergely was paid for his photograph but the agency's usual flat-rate fee for contributors is said to be \u00a3300.</p> <p>Jean-Marc Smaja, managing director of Corbis Sigma picture agency in France said that had the student negotiated a percentage fee on the open market the image could have fetched him up to a 60% cut of $100,000-$150,000 (\u00a366,000-\u00a399,000) in takings for the first three weeks. Copyright may yet revert to Mr Kisgergely for later syndication when Reuters' week-long control of the picture expires.</p> <p>Tuesday was not the first occasion on which Mr Kisgergely had witnessed an air disaster, Mr Szalmasi said. Last year he had watched a Hawk military jet crash at an air show in Slovakia.</p> <p>\"Wherever he goes there is a crash,\" Mr Szalmasi said. \"I won't fly with him.\"</p> <p>Both men hope to find work in the aviation industry when they graduate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The amateur photograph that was splashed across yesterday's newspaper front pages and television bulletins is already being acclaimed as the news picture of the year. But to the Hungarian student who took it it is just the most famous of the many aircraft photos in his collection. Andras Kisgergely, 20, a self-confessed aviation \"anorak\", took the picture moments after the passenger jet took off from Charles de Gaulle airport on Tuesday. While the photo is focused on the foreground, it shows the full plume of flames billowing from the aircraft's left wing. Experts yesterday said the photo was probably taken using compact auto-focusing camera with a small, built-in zoom lens. Within hours Reuters news agency had had the picture developed and wired it across the globe. The image is likely to be shown thousands of times in the coming months. While most tourists in Paris on Tuesday were focusing their lenses on the Eiffel tower, Notre Dame and the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Andras Kisgergely and his fellow spotter Szabolcs Szalmasi, 22, spurned the conventional sights in favour of Charles de Gaulle airport, just one stop on their annual tour of Europe's runways. The two, who are studying engineering at the Hungarian Technical University in Budapest, cannot afford to travel by plane themselves. Instead they spend two or three weeks a year driving to airports in pursuit of their hobby and have amassed an archive of thousand of aircraft shots. A spokesman for Reuters said the company would not discuss how much Mr Kisgergely was paid for his photograph but the agency's usual flat-rate fee for contributors is said to be \u00a3300. Jean-Marc Smaja, managing director of Corbis Sigma picture agency in France said that had the student negotiated a percentage fee on the open market the image could have fetched him up to a 60% cut of $100,000-$150,000 (\u00a366,000-\u00a399,000) in takings for the first three weeks. Copyright may yet revert to Mr Kisgergely for later syndication when Reuters' week-long control of the picture expires. Tuesday was not the first occasion on which Mr Kisgergely had witnessed an air disaster, Mr Szalmasi said. Last year he had watched a Hawk military jet crash at an air show in Slovakia. \"Wherever he goes there is a crash,\" Mr Szalmasi said. \"I won't fly with him.\" Both men hope to find work in the aviation industry when they graduate.",

For example, to perform a DIY search, you would click \"Home\", then \"Do-It-Yourself\". On the page that appears, there are some excellent DIY web sites listed. Then, if you use the search box, you can scan all the pages that Google has found from these sites - and only these sites. As a result, looking for \"windows\" brings up pages related to DIY and windows, and not the Windows operating system. Google is an extremely powerful tool, but it can take a bit of work. Fortunately, you can also find prebuilt search engines devoted to specific subjects at Search Engine Guide or from the list here. \u0095 Danny Sullivan is editor of Search Engine Watch Speciality search engines Moreover www.moreover.com Ners Index www.newsindex.com Newsnow www.newsnow.co.uk Napster www.napster.com Gnutella http://gnutella.wego.com Spinfrenzy www.spinfrenzy.com Lycos MP3 http://mp3.lycos.com Cnet music centre http://mp3.lycos.com Ditto www.ditto.com AltaVista Image Search images.altavista.com FAST Wap Search http://wap.fast.no Waply www.waply.com WAPAW.com www.wapaw.com Google www.google.com Somewherenear.com http://somewherenear.com RemarQ www.remarq.com eNow www.enow.com Search Engine Guide www.searchengineguide.com Search Engine Links http://searchenginewatch.com/links",

Then it's into the action which is best described as mixing Marble Madness, skateboarding and future sport. Fans of those genres will enjoy the accurate rolling and movement, but it is the rippling landscape that impresses most. </p> <p>Caused by explosions and other seismic activity, this is a remarkable graphical effect on a machine already drawing its pension, and enables you to surf past baddies and obstacles alike. The game is split up into numerous arenas made up from one of seven basic elements - race, tag, pursuit etc - but all involve time trials or tricky challenges.</p> <p>Successful arena qualification opens up further levels and there is certainly a lot to do before your spherical-limbed convict tastes freedom.

Move quickly past the wafer-thin plot - future criminals lose legs, gain ball and become freedom-seeking gladiators - and choose from a list of curiously unlovable characters. Then it's into the action which is best described as mixing Marble Madness, skateboarding and future sport. Fans of those genres will enjoy the accurate rolling and movement, but it is the rippling landscape that impresses most. Caused by explosions and other seismic activity, this is a remarkable graphical effect on a machine already drawing its pension, and enables you to surf past baddies and obstacles alike. The game is split up into numerous arenas made up from one of seven basic elements - race, tag, pursuit etc - but all involve time trials or tricky challenges. Successful arena qualification opens up further levels and there is certainly a lot to do before your spherical-limbed convict tastes freedom. But frustration can set in with a steep learning curve for first-timers. Just getting used to the physics and control takes time and it's likely that MoHo's charms will remain hidden to all but the most committed and patient gamer. Or, perhaps, to those who fondly recall the days when games were hair-wrenchingly tough and Fifa was a little known acronym.

It's a tall order, but I urge you to hold me to it.\"</p> <p>Well Mr Prescott, I hold you to it and I assert that you have failed. You have failed now, and you will fail five years, 10 years and 15 years after your promise was made. Your transport plans, for all the fanfare with which they were launched, are a disaster.</p> <p>How can I state this with such confidence? Because your own projections show it. I refer you to one of the documents you published on Thursday - Transport 2010: the background analysis. Figure 13, chapter three shows that, even if your 10-year plan is fully implemented, between 2000 and 2010 traffic volumes will increase by 17%.</p> <p>We shouldn't be surprised to find that your promise and the others that the Labour party has made (before the election, for example, it told us that it would \"reduce and then reverse traffic growth\"), will be comprehensively broken. Studies dating back to 1938 show that road building generates traffic: new roads fill up until congestion persuades drivers to find a different way to travel. As one of your transport ministers commented in 1998, \"the fact of the matter is that we cannot tackle our traffic problems by building new roads\".</p> <p>If you don't believe him, look at what has happened in Newbury. According to a report by West Berkshire Council, following the construction of the new bypass \"there is no consistent pattern of traffic change over the Newbury network as a whole\". As the inevitable \"infill\" development between the bypass and the town generates its own traffic, the long-term impact on the town centre could turn out to be deeply negative.</p> <p>Even your 10-year plan acknowledges that \"simply building more and bigger roads is not the answer: we need a more strategic approach\". But a more strategic approach is precisely what you have failed to deliver. You have announced that 100 bypasses will be built and 360 miles of roads widened before these schemes have been identified, or the need for them has been established. In other words, you have decided to build first, ask questions later.</p> <p>You surely know better than anyone else that people will not leave their cars behind until there are both incentives to take alternative forms of transport, and disincentives to drive. Instead, you have offered both new incentives to take the train and, through new road building, new incentives to take the car.</p> <p>You promised an integrated transport system, but you have delivered instead a formula for self-destruction - one half of your scheme neatly undermines the other.</p> <p>So why are you doing this? The Confederation of British Industry has kindly provided us with a clue. Your plan, it announced, is \"a monumental victory for the business community\". The CBI's lobbyists demanded a transport package worth \u00a3180m, and this is, to the pound, what you gave them. The primary purpose of most large-scale construction is to provide contracts for developers. You have given a struggling construction industry everything it wanted.</p> <p>The only logical concomitant of a massive investment in public transport is not the \u00a321bn road building programme you have announced, but a \u00a321bn road closure programme. If you are to honour your promises, you must gradually reduce the amount of available road space, rather than increasing it. A long-term, carefully phased road closure plan would show that you genuinely want to make ours a healthier, more cohesive, more inclusive society, governed not by corporations and a handful of target voters, but by the best interests of all of its people. You could start to achieve all the things your \"integrated\" department claims it stands for: less air pollution, more peace and quiet, more space - as land is released - for playing fields, housing and conservation. And your \"public transport revolution\" would be an unquestionable and irreversible success.</p> <p>Instead, Mr Prescott, you have lost faith in your own objectives. You have already broken your promise, made before the election, not to build the Birmingham Northern Relief Road. You will break your promise not to build the Salisbury bypass. You have broken your promises to reduce the amount of traffic on our roads. Soon, young people all over Britain will take to the trees and the tunnels once more, in an effort to force you to keep the promises you made in order to attract our votes. And you will call them undemocratic.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com </a></p>",

The CBI's lobbyists demanded a transport package worth \u00a3180m, and this is, to the pound, what you gave them. The primary purpose of most large-scale construction is to provide contracts for developers. You have given a struggling construction industry everything it wanted. The only logical concomitant of a massive investment in public transport is not the \u00a321bn road building programme you have announced, but a \u00a321bn road closure programme. If you are to honour your promises, you must gradually reduce the amount of available road space, rather than increasing it. A long-term, carefully phased road closure plan would show that you genuinely want to make ours a healthier, more cohesive, more inclusive society, governed not by corporations and a handful of target voters, but by the best interests of all of its people. You could start to achieve all the things your \"integrated\" department claims it stands for: less air pollution, more peace and quiet, more space - as land is released - for playing fields, housing and conservation. And your \"public transport revolution\" would be an unquestionable and irreversible success. Instead, Mr Prescott, you have lost faith in your own objectives. You have already broken your promise, made before the election, not to build the Birmingham Northern Relief Road. You will break your promise not to build the Salisbury bypass. You have broken your promises to reduce the amount of traffic on our roads. Soon, young people all over Britain will take to the trees and the tunnels once more, in an effort to force you to keep the promises you made in order to attract our votes. And you will call them undemocratic. comment@theguardian.com",

At 2.30pm an airline spokesman handed a single sheet of paper to the media waiting at the company headquarters in Roissy, part of the Charles de Gaulle airport complex. It gave two reasons for \"the delay\" of flight AF4590. Air France said the first reason for the delay was that the 100 passengers \"on this very special flight\" had very short connection times at the Paris airport. Because of the late arrival of their luggage from Frankfurt, flight AF4590 was delayed. But the sheet of paper also revealed that during a flight from John F. Kennedy airport in New York arriving back last Monday, the captain of the aircraft had reported that the system that reverses the thrust of the engine was not working. The release said that the spare part for the reverse thrusters was not immediately available from the \"parts warehouse\" in Paris. The statement went on: \"Given the technical tolerance authorised by the manufacturer, the aircraft could take off again without being repaired ...\" This information was presented to the captain of flight AF4590, who decided to overrule the advice and have the spare part installed. The part was immediately obtained from another Concorde, Air France said, and the repairs took 30 minutes to carry out. Under aviation rules, which apply to all airlines, the captain has the ultimate responsibility for control of an aircraft. If he thinks there is a problem, he is bound to ignore any commercial pressures placed on him to take off. Speaking on Channel 4 News, Bill Tench, Britain's former chief air accident investigator, suggested last night that the mechanics would have been under great pressure to complete the work in order to meet the flight's departure slot. \"It's possible that in their hurry to change the component, a panel was not completely replaced. Consequently when the pilot opened the throttle, I'm pretty sure the suction would pull the panel out and break the compressor [in the engine] into pieces,\" he said. Sources among emergency services at the airport yesterday told the Guardian that the Concorde had developed problems as it attempted to take off. The airport's emergency services had been scrambled as the plane began to take off and problems with the number two engine became apparent. As the plane left the ground, airport staff said flames were clearly visible streaming from the affected engine. The conversation taped on the cockpit voice recorder between the pilot, Christian Marty, and air traffic controllers reveals that 56 seconds into the run the rear of the aircraft was belching flames.

Captain John Cook, 66, joined the Concorde development team in 1974 as a technical adviser representing the Pilots' Association, and went on to fly 6,300 hours in 12 years as a Concorde captain. He believes that the crew of the plane were aware that there had been a serious engine failure and were taking steps to deal with it. \"You can see from the final picture of the plane that the nose wheel is up - the main landing gear is still down - but the front wheel is up which indicates the pilot was attempting to gain as much speed as possible,\" he said. \"When you have an engine fire during takeoff that's the first thing you do, try and gain speed not height, so in case the fire spreads to another engine and you're down to two you've still got enough spit to get you off the ground.

Far from being superhumanly powerful, the Tories are at their lowest point.

Microsoft said the antitrust case would be an \"extraordinary burden on the supreme court\", given the \"morass of procedural and substantive issues that can be resolved only through a painstaking review of a lengthy and technologically complex trial record\". Microsoft asked that the court of appeals for the District of Columbia hear the case. In 1998, Microsoft won a victory in that court. Billiton gains CVRD stake The metals and mining conglomerate Billiton said yesterday it had acquired a minority stake in Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the world's largest iron ore producer. Billiton, which has been seeking a stake in CVRD for some time, agreed to acquire a 67% holding in Sweet River Investments for $327.3m. Sweet River holds just under 12% of Valepar, CVRD's controlling shareholder. This gives the former South African mining operator a 2.1% stake in the Brazilian company. Billiton paid the equivalent of $40 each for its CVRD shares which were trading at around $26 in Sao Paulo on Tuesday.",

      "bodyText": "Six hundred Eurocrats are being offered early retirement in an overhaul of the European Union's executive arm, and a much-maligned private food shop where European commission officials can buy their favourite national delicacies is to be shut. Romano Prodi, the president of the commission, and Neil Kinnock, his British deputy, announced yesterday that long-overdue internal reforms would help the 18,000-strong commission to close the widening gap between tasks and resources. Having concluded that 1,250 jobs needed to be filled, the commissioners decided to ask for 375 new recruits and make up the shortfall by a combination of efficiency gains and redeployment of staff. The measures include non-compulsory early retirements. Personnel changes are a key element of the reform process launched last year after the resignation of Jacques Santer's discredited commission following allegations of mismanagement, fraud, sleaze and cronyism at the heart of the EU. \"The commission has made major efforts to modernise and improve internal procedures,\" Mr Prodi said. \"We are going to have to squeeze a lot out of our staff.\" Personnel are to be redeployed to understaffed areas where the role of Brussels has expanded in recent years. Some 300 will go to external relations, where Britain's second EU commissioner, Chris Patten, has pledged to improve delivery of the community's \u00a35.7bn aid programme, the world's largest. Other officials are being sent to work on food safety, the environment and new areas of justice and home affairs, such as fighting crime. More financial managers, lawyers, personnel managers and IT experts are also needed. Mr Kinnock said that he could no longer justify the existence of the shop, the Economat, which was opened in the 1960s to allow homesick Italian functionaries to buy olive oil, and Britons their marmalade and breakfast tea. Although it is neither subsidised nor secret, the shop featured regularly in stories with an anti-EU agenda, often combined with details of the tax-free perks and allowances which have made Eurocrats a byword for feather-bedding. \"I couldn't justify the continued maintenance of shopkeeping as one of the roles of the European Commission,\" Mr Kinnock said. The unions are expected to react badly to the staffing reforms. They claimed earlier this week that they had not been adequately consulted. Mr Kinnock, the former Labour party leader and one of the few survivors of the Santer commission, pledged earlier this year to build the \"best multinational administration in the world\". But he acknowledged last week that the process was moving slowly. Most of the 15 EU member states want to see changes to ensure efficiency, accountability, transparency and public faith restored in the scandal-battered commission. Recent appointments have been made on merit rather than according to informal national quotas, as in the past, though the French are annoyed that several key jobs have been given to talented British candidates. One British official, Jonathan Faull, was confirmed yesterday as the commission's chief spokesman after the removal of an Italian ex-journalist and confidant of Mr Prodi who was felt to be ineffective.",

Benjamin Pell, a professional muckraker who makes a decent living going through rubbish, specialises in stealing waste.

Addresses of prominent people and firms are targeted and it is collected ritually according to precise timings, mainly at night. To avoid detection after a series of scrapes with the law, Pell even recycles old rubbish so householders and office staff are not left wondering where it all went. He believes he is a social necessity, not a social menace. Nor does he accept he is breaking the law; the culprits are individuals such as Labour pollster Philip Gould and firms carelessly disposing of confidential documents. Pell, 36, has been diagnosed as suffering from a very severe form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. As well as filling the family home with papers, his daily routine involves repeated checks of doors, locks, lights and other possessions. The illness is thought to have started in his early teens after an older brother died in a car crash. Around the age of 14 he became known as the \"bag boy\", carrying around half a dozen bags stuffed with papers and books. He started a law course at University College, London, but unexpectedly failed his law exams in 1986. Ashamed, Pell did not tell his parents and for eight months pretended he was a lawyer until they found out. After a further ill-fated stab at joining the legal profession, he started work for a cleaning company and then started his own cleaning firm. That set him off down the road that led him to being named as the source of the leaked Downing Street memos that rocked the government. His contempt for the the lawyers who refused to embrace him as one of their own and growing interest in rubbish saw him raiding the bins of solicitors and barristers. He took the waste home to sift through the dregs of everyday life in search of notes, letters, credit card details and bank statements of the rich and famous.

Another invoice, from Mirror Group Newspapers, detailed \u00a31,435 paid during July last year ranging from \u00a315 for a tale about TV presenter Clive Anderson to \u00a3400 for a story about ex-Spice Girl Geri Halliwell.

Mr Gould and Lord Levy, the millionaire Labour fund raiser who saw his low tax bill splashed across the Sunday Times last month, were on a list handed to him earlier this year by a non-News International contact. Security sources yesterday said MI5 had even \"warned off\" certain journalists and editors after Pell was accused of taking the waste of some of their own. Pell is well known to the police and was fined \u00a320 in London last November on five counts of \"stealing documentary waste\". The court was told he had been seen loading rubbish into his van outside a firm of Harley Street solicitors that represented Jonathan Aitken and James Hewitt. When he was searched in Marylebone police station officers discovered a \u00a32,500 cheque from News International. A search of his home uncovered at least 200,000 documents in his garden shed. Earlier this year, Pell was alleged to be involved in a \u00a310,000 deal to supply Mohamed Al Fayed with papers suggesting the questions he might face in his libel battle with former Tory minister Neil Hamilton. Readers of virtually every national newspaper will at some point have read a scoop inspired or informed by his rumagings.

      "body": "<p>There will be no retrial of the senior police officer who was in charge of crowd control on the day of the Hillsborough football disaster, a judge has ruled.</p> <p>For the families of the 96 Liverpool fans who died, the ruling represents the end of an 11-year campaign for what they saw as justice.</p> <p>Earlier this week, a jury at Leeds crown court was unable to agree a verdict on former chief superintendent David Duckenfield, who was accused of two specimen charges of manslaughter, to which he pleaded not guilty. The trial judge, Mr Justice Hooper, was asked by solicitors representing the families whether a second trial could take place. Yesterday he ordered a stay on proceedings against Mr Duckenfield. He will outline the reasons for his decision tomorrow.</p> <p>The Hillsborough Family Support Group, which had brought the private prosecution against the officer, and another officer who was earlier acquitted, announced that it would take no further legal action. Each day for six weeks the group's members had packed the public gallery at court number five, and had waited while the jury deliberated for more than 24 hours over five days in Mr Duckenfield's case. All wanted verdicts that would suggest that someone was to blame for the deaths. They did not get them.</p> <p>Shortly before lunch on Monday, the jury sent a note to the judge saying they were unable to reach a verdict against Mr Duckenfield.</p> <p>He had denied charges concerning two fans, John Anderson, 62, and James Aspinall, 18, crushed to death on the terraces at Sheffield Wednesday's ground during Liverpool's FA cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in April 1989.</p> <p>Former superintendent Bernard Murray, 58, of Pontefract, West Yorkshire, who was Mr Duckenfield's deputy, was cleared of the same charges last Friday. Several families wept as they left court.</p> <p>Yesterday Alun Jones QC, representing the families, told Mr Justice Hooper that he was seeking a retrial against Mr Duckenfield. William Clegg QC, counsel for Mr Duckenfield, argued that a new trial would put unfair pressure on the officer and his family.</p> <p>During the trial, the families' counsel had claimed the two officers were responsible for the fans' deaths, having ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve the crush outside the turnstiles without taking steps to block off a tunnel leading to the overcrowded Leppings Lane terraces.</p> <p>It emerged that Mr Duckenfield, 55, of Bournemouth, in Dorset, did not give evidence because he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. As he left the court yesterday, several people shouted abuse. His solicitor, Simon Eastwood, said: \"As a husband and father he has every sympathy with the victims' families.\"</p> <p>Inevitably, the families were disappointed. Trevor Hicks, chairman of the support group, said: \"The conduct of the core of the trial, we felt, was satisfactory. But what we objected strongly to was the summing-up and the directions from the judge in the last few days.\"</p> <p>Margaret Aspinall, whose son was named in the charges, said she was angry and upset: \"The police can't always be exonerated. Somebody has to be accountable.\"</p> <p>The judge ordered that the majority of the prosecution and defence costs, estimated at \u00a34m, should be paid from public funds.</p> <p>The outcome was welcomed by Peter Gammon, president of the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales, since it had been \"a travesty\" for two former senior officers to have been in the dock for a decision they had taken so many years ago.</p> <p>\"The decision to open the gate was taken because lives were endangered outside the ground,\" he said. \"They could never have predicted that death would result.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "There will be no retrial of the senior police officer who was in charge of crowd control on the day of the Hillsborough football disaster, a judge has ruled. For the families of the 96 Liverpool fans who died, the ruling represents the end of an 11-year campaign for what they saw as justice. Earlier this week, a jury at Leeds crown court was unable to agree a verdict on former chief superintendent David Duckenfield, who was accused of two specimen charges of manslaughter, to which he pleaded not guilty. The trial judge, Mr Justice Hooper, was asked by solicitors representing the families whether a second trial could take place. Yesterday he ordered a stay on proceedings against Mr Duckenfield. He will outline the reasons for his decision tomorrow. The Hillsborough Family Support Group, which had brought the private prosecution against the officer, and another officer who was earlier acquitted, announced that it would take no further legal action. Each day for six weeks the group's members had packed the public gallery at court number five, and had waited while the jury deliberated for more than 24 hours over five days in Mr Duckenfield's case. All wanted verdicts that would suggest that someone was to blame for the deaths. They did not get them. Shortly before lunch on Monday, the jury sent a note to the judge saying they were unable to reach a verdict against Mr Duckenfield. He had denied charges concerning two fans, John Anderson, 62, and James Aspinall, 18, crushed to death on the terraces at Sheffield Wednesday's ground during Liverpool's FA cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in April 1989. Former superintendent Bernard Murray, 58, of Pontefract, West Yorkshire, who was Mr Duckenfield's deputy, was cleared of the same charges last Friday. Several families wept as they left court. Yesterday Alun Jones QC, representing the families, told Mr Justice Hooper that he was seeking a retrial against Mr Duckenfield. William Clegg QC, counsel for Mr Duckenfield, argued that a new trial would put unfair pressure on the officer and his family. During the trial, the families' counsel had claimed the two officers were responsible for the fans' deaths, having ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve the crush outside the turnstiles without taking steps to block off a tunnel leading to the overcrowded Leppings Lane terraces. It emerged that Mr Duckenfield, 55, of Bournemouth, in Dorset, did not give evidence because he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. As he left the court yesterday, several people shouted abuse. His solicitor, Simon Eastwood, said: \"As a husband and father he has every sympathy with the victims' families.\" Inevitably, the families were disappointed. Trevor Hicks, chairman of the support group, said: \"The conduct of the core of the trial, we felt, was satisfactory. But what we objected strongly to was the summing-up and the directions from the judge in the last few days.\" Margaret Aspinall, whose son was named in the charges, said she was angry and upset: \"The police can't always be exonerated. Somebody has to be accountable.\" The judge ordered that the majority of the prosecution and defence costs, estimated at \u00a34m, should be paid from public funds. The outcome was welcomed by Peter Gammon, president of the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales, since it had been \"a travesty\" for two former senior officers to have been in the dock for a decision they had taken so many years ago. \"The decision to open the gate was taken because lives were endangered outside the ground,\" he said. \"They could never have predicted that death would result.\"",

Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said he wanted \"six-figure\" sums levied in serious cases and hinted he would press for punishments ranging up to 10% of annual turnover unless courts made fuller use of their powers. The environment agency, responsible for prosecuting most offenders in England and Wales said some punishments amounted to \"not even a mosquito bite\". They effectively encouraged companies to break the law rather than invest in anti-pollution measures and failed to reflect the long term damage caused in pollution incidents. The agency, which yesterday named and shamed the worst pollution offenders prosecuted during 1999, said the average level of fines was far too low - \u00a34,750 per offence, or only \u00a33,500 if the \u00a3750,000 penalty imposed on Milford Haven port authority for the 1996 Sea Empress disaster, was removed from the list. This is well under the \u00a320,000 or six months imprisonment that can be imposed by magistrates or the unlimited fine and two years imprisonment possible at crown courts.

He also said that new utilities legislation gave regulators power to fine companies up to 10% of their annual turnover for breaking competition rules. John Harmon, chairman of the agency, said: \"We are deeply concerned that it can still be cheaper for a business or individual to commit an environmental crime than it is to comply with the law. \"The fines are still derisory compared to the state of corporate finance. It is simply not enough. It is not a deterrent. It is not even a mosquito bite.\" More than 500 businesses and individuals were prosecuted last year. The agency also praised some companies including AES Drax power station, Selby, North Yorkshire, Associated Octel, Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, and BP Chemicals in Hull for big reductions in pollutant emissions. Thames Water, which has an annual turnover of nearly \u00a31.5bn, topped the prosecutions table, with eight resulting in fines totalling \u00a379.000. A Thames Water spokeswoman said: \"We regret our position in the league table but it is only one measure of our environmental performance.

Numerous farmers, it alleges, have been ordered to leave their properties immediately, though the Zanu-PF supporters have \"no legal authority\" to issue such eviction notices.</p> <p>\"Death threats are being issued with such vehemence and conviction that it would be foolhardy for anyone to ignore them,\" the CFU alleges. \"The whole situation is greatly aggravated by totally inadequate police reaction.\"</p> <p>The lawsuit also names the country's police commissioner, Augustine Chihuri, and the leader of the war veterans' group that has taken a leading role in the farm occupations, Chenjerai Hunzvi.</p> <p>The courts twice ruled that the occupations were illegal, but Mr Mugabe ordered the police to take no action to end the squatting on the farms.</p> <p>The farmers' union says it will drop the legal proceedings against the president if he takes immediate action to end the occupations and restore law and order. The production of tobacco, maize, wheat and other key crops has been disrupted. Tobacco is the country's key export commodity.</p> <p>In the northern Karoi area, 230 white-owned farms have closed in protest at the farm invasions. Most of the shops in Karoi have also shut to show solidarity with the white farmers. A Karoi farmer, David Brand, was beaten unconscious on Tuesday by war veterans and was recovering yesterday.</p> <p>The opposition Movement for Democratic Change went ahead yesterday with its legal challenge to 28 parliamentary seats won by Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party in the June 24 and 25 elections.</p> <p>Zanu-PF won 62 of the 120 elected seats, and the MDC won 57. But because Mr Mugabe can appoint 30 MPs, his party has ended up holding 92 of the 150 parliamentary seats.</p> <p>Large-scale electoral irregularities were being alleged yesterday in the Mazowe East constituency, where officials were investigating the voting papers. Lawyers for the MDC claim that many people voted twice, and in some cases the dead cast ballots.</p> <p>The MDC is hoping not only to overturn several results but to have some Zanu-PF candidates barred from office.</p> <p>\u0095The government raised the price of regular petrol by almost 26% yesterday. It also raised the price of kerosene - used by the poor for lighting and cooking - by 128%. With inflation already at 70% and unemployment at 50%, the increases are bound to raise hostility to the government.</p>",

Numerous farmers, it alleges, have been ordered to leave their properties immediately, though the Zanu-PF supporters have \"no legal authority\" to issue such eviction notices. \"Death threats are being issued with such vehemence and conviction that it would be foolhardy for anyone to ignore them,\" the CFU alleges. \"The whole situation is greatly aggravated by totally inadequate police reaction.\" The lawsuit also names the country's police commissioner, Augustine Chihuri, and the leader of the war veterans' group that has taken a leading role in the farm occupations, Chenjerai Hunzvi. The courts twice ruled that the occupations were illegal, but Mr Mugabe ordered the police to take no action to end the squatting on the farms. The farmers' union says it will drop the legal proceedings against the president if he takes immediate action to end the occupations and restore law and order. The production of tobacco, maize, wheat and other key crops has been disrupted. Tobacco is the country's key export commodity. In the northern Karoi area, 230 white-owned farms have closed in protest at the farm invasions. Most of the shops in Karoi have also shut to show solidarity with the white farmers. A Karoi farmer, David Brand, was beaten unconscious on Tuesday by war veterans and was recovering yesterday. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change went ahead yesterday with its legal challenge to 28 parliamentary seats won by Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party in the June 24 and 25 elections. Zanu-PF won 62 of the 120 elected seats, and the MDC won 57. But because Mr Mugabe can appoint 30 MPs, his party has ended up holding 92 of the 150 parliamentary seats. Large-scale electoral irregularities were being alleged yesterday in the Mazowe East constituency, where officials were investigating the voting papers. Lawyers for the MDC claim that many people voted twice, and in some cases the dead cast ballots. The MDC is hoping not only to overturn several results but to have some Zanu-PF candidates barred from office. \u0095The government raised the price of regular petrol by almost 26% yesterday. It also raised the price of kerosene - used by the poor for lighting and cooking - by 128%. With inflation already at 70% and unemployment at 50%, the increases are bound to raise hostility to the government.",

Protests erupted after the ambassadors approved a plan by Javier Solana, the union's defence and foreign policy chief, to drastically curtail the relatively open approach to official papers. The plan puts a block exemption on documents about military and crisis-management planning which are likely to be accessible under current rules. The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden voted against the plan. One official involved protested furiously that it amounted to a \"military coup\". The row highlights a sharp clash of cultures as the EU develops its own defence structures, which require close cooperation with Nato and its strict security procedures. Mr Solana, a former Nato secretary-general, is moving cautiously to avoid alarming Eurosceptics and Americans who are afraid that Nato will be weakened if the EU gets the military muscle to match its economic weight. \"He's got to find a way that denies the right of automatic access to documents that are given to him, otherwise he'd never get the information he needs from the member states,\" one national official insisted. Mr Solana wants to block not only military documents but also documents about non-military crisis management activities, such as the proposed EU police force to operate after a Kosovo-type conflict. It is feared that the ban might be extended to sensitive areas such as police and judicial cooperation. The freedom of information watchdog Statewatch said the approach undermined the commitment in the 1997 Amsterdam treaty to the public's right of access to documents. The plan infuriated MEPs, who have just started discussing a commission proposal for a code of access to meet the Amsterdam pledge. . \"Solana is trying to introduce Nato's secretive methods into the EU through the backdoor,\" Heidi Hautala, the Finnish co-president of the Green group in the EU parliament, said.",

And while giving the Palestinians formal control of outlying neighbourhoods they already largely control, the proposal sought to keep most of the city under exclusive Israeli sovereignty.</p> <p>Nevertheless, after 33 years of stubbornly repeating the mantra that Jerusalem is Israel's \"eternal and undivided capital\", some Israeli politicians are finally realising they face a choice.</p> <p>They can keep the 230,000 Arabs of Jerusalem - the largest Arab city in the West Bank - under their exclusive sovereignty, with the certainty that this will prevent Palestinian and Arab acceptance of a peace accord. Or they can give the Palestinians some form of sovereign authority in Jerusalem, and full municipal control over the Arab part of the city, and obtain a lasting peace.</p> <p>Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, presumably recoiled from the full political implications of this choice. But a shift has begun in Israel away from the mindless repetition of an unreal and unrealisable slogan, and towards accepting the need to share the Holy City.</p> <p>Less progress has been made on refugees.

      "bodyText": "The breakdown of the Camp David talks should not obscure the fact that after years of a \"peace process\" that prevented negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis on the most important issues, a rational discussion of the previously taboo topics of refugees and Jerusalem has at last begun in Israel and elsewhere. This is not to say that the Israeli proposals leaked during the talks were in any way sufficient as a basis for resolving these issues. On refugees, the proposals apparently involved a refusal to accept any Israeli responsibility for the creation of this problem, a refusal to accept the right of return (except for a mere 5,000 a year, spread over two decades), and the brazen suggestion that others pay any compensation on offer. On Jerusalem, the offer seems to have involved no Arab or shared sovereignty over the Old City or - outside the walls, the Mount of Olives, the districts of Silwan and Sheikh Jarrah, or the Saladin Street business area - the core of Arab Jerusalem. And while giving the Palestinians formal control of outlying neighbourhoods they already largely control, the proposal sought to keep most of the city under exclusive Israeli sovereignty. Nevertheless, after 33 years of stubbornly repeating the mantra that Jerusalem is Israel's \"eternal and undivided capital\", some Israeli politicians are finally realising they face a choice. They can keep the 230,000 Arabs of Jerusalem - the largest Arab city in the West Bank - under their exclusive sovereignty, with the certainty that this will prevent Palestinian and Arab acceptance of a peace accord. Or they can give the Palestinians some form of sovereign authority in Jerusalem, and full municipal control over the Arab part of the city, and obtain a lasting peace. Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, presumably recoiled from the full political implications of this choice. But a shift has begun in Israel away from the mindless repetition of an unreal and unrealisable slogan, and towards accepting the need to share the Holy City. Less progress has been made on refugees. This is in spite of all that Israeli new historians, educators, and journalists have done to replace the mythology of Israel's virgin birth in 1948 with an appreciation of the suffering and loss inflicted on the Palestinians as a precondition for creating a Jewish state in a place with a two-thirds Arab majority that owned over 90% of the land. But even here, the subject is finally on the table, and the property and residence rights of the 750,000 Palestinians who were driven out in 1948 can no longer be ignored. Israel argued that these negotiations had to result in a binding end to the conflict. This is an admirable objective. It cannot be achieved, however, without addressing the taboo issues which Israel has long succeeded in per suading its American friends to exclude from the negotiations, and indeed from rational discussion. If this conflict is to be ended, its root causes, in particular the issues of refugees and Jerusalem, must finally be faced squarely. This means that there must be a fair formula for the sharing of Jerusalem, and that Israel must accept its responsibility for the wrongs done to the refugees, and offer redress. This redress should be in the form of return for a proportion of them - certainly those with families living in the 100 Arab villages remaining in Israel - combined with restitution of, or compensation for, property lost. None of this will be easy, nor will it happen soon. But for it to happen will require a genuine public debate in Israel. This is a process which the failed Camp David talks have belatedly begun. \u0095 Professor Rashid Khalidi teaches history at the University of Chicago and is the author of Palestinian Identity.

The trial will probably begin within three weeks.</p> <p>A spokesman at the attorney general's office, Yushar Yahya, said yesterday that a letter detailing the charges would be submitted to a court early next month. Under Indonesian law a suspect is formally charged on the first day of a trial, which must begin within two weeks of the letter being submitted.</p> <p>\"The letter states that he is charged with the criminal act of corruption,\" Mr Yahya said. \"It will definitely be submitted before August 10 [the date Mr Suharto's house arrest order expires]\".</p> <p>It is widely alleged that the retired general amassed a fortune worth tens of billions of pounds during his 32-year reign until May 1998. Indonesia's current president, Abdurrahman Wahid, announced last month that he believed Mr Suharto had stolen about \u00a330bn while in office and had allowed his family and cronies to rake off billions as well.</p> <p>The announcement came shortly after Mr Suharto, 79, lost a libel suit against the American news magazine Time, which claimed that the one-time strongman was worth about \u00a327bn.</p> <p>Mr Wahid has repeatedly promised to pardon Mr Suharto if he returns at least \u00a325bn.</p> <p>The attorney general's investigation is focusing on how seven charitable foundations controlled by Mr Suharto acquired tens of millions of dollars, and to whom the money was disbursed. \"We chose to focus on the foundations first because it is easier to obtain evidence about them,\" Mr Yahya said. \"We will see how this prosecution goes before we move on to anything else.\"</p> <p>Last week, the prosecutors seized a 12-storey office building in central Jakarta owned by the foundations and confiscated a mansion belonging to a Suharto crony, Zahid Husein, the former treasurer of one of the charities.</p> <p>One of Mr Suharto's lawyers, Juan Felix Tampubolon, said yesterday that the prosecutors had no firm evidence, and that their actions were politically motivated. \"The attorney-general has violated Suharto's human rights,\" he said. \"He has pursued this case for political purposes.\"</p> <p>President Wahid and the attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, have come under intense pressure to prosecute Mr Suharto quickly. There are demonstrations about the slow pace of the investigation on most days in Jakarta.</p> <p>Mr Tampubolon reiterated that Mr Suharto was not well enough to stand trial.\"He's an old man in failing health who should be left to spend his remaining days in peace.\"</p> <p>He suffered a further public humiliation this week when the central bank announced that banknotes depicting his face would no longer be legal tender after August 21.</p>",

The trial will probably begin within three weeks. A spokesman at the attorney general's office, Yushar Yahya, said yesterday that a letter detailing the charges would be submitted to a court early next month. Under Indonesian law a suspect is formally charged on the first day of a trial, which must begin within two weeks of the letter being submitted. \"The letter states that he is charged with the criminal act of corruption,\" Mr Yahya said. \"It will definitely be submitted before August 10 [the date Mr Suharto's house arrest order expires]\". It is widely alleged that the retired general amassed a fortune worth tens of billions of pounds during his 32-year reign until May 1998. Indonesia's current president, Abdurrahman Wahid, announced last month that he believed Mr Suharto had stolen about \u00a330bn while in office and had allowed his family and cronies to rake off billions as well. The announcement came shortly after Mr Suharto, 79, lost a libel suit against the American news magazine Time, which claimed that the one-time strongman was worth about \u00a327bn. Mr Wahid has repeatedly promised to pardon Mr Suharto if he returns at least \u00a325bn. The attorney general's investigation is focusing on how seven charitable foundations controlled by Mr Suharto acquired tens of millions of dollars, and to whom the money was disbursed. \"We chose to focus on the foundations first because it is easier to obtain evidence about them,\" Mr Yahya said. \"We will see how this prosecution goes before we move on to anything else.\" Last week, the prosecutors seized a 12-storey office building in central Jakarta owned by the foundations and confiscated a mansion belonging to a Suharto crony, Zahid Husein, the former treasurer of one of the charities. One of Mr Suharto's lawyers, Juan Felix Tampubolon, said yesterday that the prosecutors had no firm evidence, and that their actions were politically motivated. \"The attorney-general has violated Suharto's human rights,\" he said. \"He has pursued this case for political purposes.\" President Wahid and the attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, have come under intense pressure to prosecute Mr Suharto quickly. There are demonstrations about the slow pace of the investigation on most days in Jakarta. Mr Tampubolon reiterated that Mr Suharto was not well enough to stand trial.\"He's an old man in failing health who should be left to spend his remaining days in peace.\" He suffered a further public humiliation this week when the central bank announced that banknotes depicting his face would no longer be legal tender after August 21.",

Mr Speight, who stormed the parliament in May and took most of the cabinet captive, was stopped at a bridge checkpoint in Kolabu, 12 miles east of Suva, where scores of his supporters have gathered. \"There's a number of allegations that were being brought to us about the carriage of arms in and around Suva by Speight and his bodyguards, and about threats to the head of state,\" a military spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Filipo Tarakinikini, said. There were no details about the alleged threats to Fiji's head of state, ailing 79-year-old President Ratu Josefa Iloilo. Col Tarakinikini said that an amnesty granted to Mr Speight as part of the deal to secure the release of the hostages would only come into effect once all his weapons had been returned. A total of 18 M-16 rifles and pistols taken from military arsenals had still not been handed back, so the amnesty did not yet apply, he said in a statement. \"We cannot have private militias operating around the country,\" Col Tarakinikini told a local radio station. The military earlier deployed troops across the racially-split country, fearing renewed civil unrest when a new government and possibly a new prime minister are named today. Mr Speight had threatened new unrest if his nationalist candidate for prime minister, a 60-year-old diplomat, Adi Samanunu Cakobau, was not accepted in place of the military-backed caretaker prime minister, Laisenia Qarase. \"The people could react,\" Mr Speight had warned. Col Tarakinikini said that five warning shots were fired before Mr Speight was arrested along with his legal adviser, Tevita Bukaru, his media adviser, Jo Nata, and a bodyguard, Ireli Cakau. He said that Mr Speight and his supporters would be held inside the Queen Elizabeth military barracks on a hilltop overlooking Suva. Mr Speight and his gunmen stormed parliament on May 19 to demand more rights for indigenous Fijians. The rebels held Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, and most of his cabinet hostage for eight weeks before releasing them on July 13. Mr Speight won widespread support among Fijian nationalists in his bid to limit the political power of Fiji's Indian community, which makes up 44% of the islands' 800,000 population and dominates the tourism and sugar-based economy which has been hit hard by the political crisis. Sporadic violence flared around Suva and other parts of the country in the wake of Mr Speight's coup, and the military declared martial law on May 29 in an attempt to restore order. There was no immediate response from President Iloilo or Mr Qarase about Mr Speight's arrest or future government plans. Local media reports said yesterday that the new government would be sworn in on Friday with Mr Qarase at its head. A presidential aide, Joe Brown, gave no indication of who would head the government.

Looking like he'd just come in from the Jerry Springer Show, and living in a mansion that wouldn't have been out of place in Costa's beach poster, Dr Rog promised to cure Christine over the phone - by having her tap two fingers against her skin, just below her right eye, while thinking about mice. </p> <p>It was meant to trigger an acupuncture point but didn't work. \"This\", said Dr Rog, as I braced myself for a complicated scientific explanation, \"is what we call... a very complex phobia.\" Next, Christine was told to drape herself in a towel, since Dr Rog, despite being 6,000 miles away, had detected that her T-shirt was toxic and interfering with the treatment. </p> <p>Jacqueline and Christine were eventually cured through some straightforward exposure therapy on the black leather sofas of the medically qualified. Within 45 minutes Jacqueline was stroking a feather and, to celebrate, went off to feed ducks with her daughter. Christine wrote the word mouse 24,720 times (previously impossible even once) and ended up giving one a big smacker on the lips. </p> <p>This gently sympathetic programme ended on an appropriately bizarre note. Christine got her back tattooed with a cartoon mouse sporting a buck-toothed grin. </p> <p> <strong> Celebrity Rehab</strong> (Channel 4) had plenty of rehab but was somewhat short on the celebrity front, unless John Reid, ex-manager of Elton John, is your idea of an A-list pin-up. Clarissa Dickson Wright, Marc Almond, Jim Davidson and Chris Difford (he was in Squeeze, a pop group) were wheeled out to offer such staggering insights on the fine art of going cold turkey as: \"It's quite tough.\" </p> <p>Featuring much clunky visual padding - an out-of-focus reconstruction of people actually drinking beer in a bar was particularly unmemorable - Celebrity Rehab was a sad reminder that stars are generally lots more fun when they're on a drug-fuelled bender than when they're trying to get off one.

The usual ingredients for a sibling pop group are Shirley Temple wholesomeness, cute falsettos and a domineering parent.

Reactions were extreme - the New York Times called it \"the best worst rock album ever made\". Most thought it was an elaborate hoax. The singing is flat, the guitars are out of tune, and only once on the whole album does the drummer hit the beat (on the intro to the tortured Why Do I Feel). Philosophy Of The World is awful by any musical definition, but is so obviously innocent and heartfelt (songs about pets and parents, titles like My Companion) that it exists and succeeds in a dimension all of its own.

Little Helen had a soft spot for Ricky Nelson. Austin Jr had always wanted music lessons as a kid and actively encouraged his daughters. Betty and Dot took guitar and voice lessons for a year, Helen was the drummer. At high school they carried on taking lessons through the mail and, by 1969, Austin Jr thought they were ready to cut a record. \"I want to get them while they're hot,\" he told the engineer. Nobody else thought they were ready, least of all the girls: \"We didn't feel we knew that much about music. [Dad] gave us a lot of support. He backed us up all the way.\" </p> <p>Austin Jr naively trusted a local entrepreneur to release the album on a label called Third World, but after receiving one box of records the label and its owner disappeared with the Wiggins' money. You could say that a father's love is unconditional or you could call Austin Wiggin a visionary. Philosophy Of The World is one of the most honest and expressive records ever made. It's completely free of pretension and self-awareness. Obviously this sets the artists up for all manner of cynical abuse, but the recent rediscovery of similarly untarnished soulmates like English folk singer Vashti Bunyan and American harmony group the Free Design (sample songtitles: Kites Are Fun, My Brother Woody) indicates that there's a substantial, non-ironic audience for the Shaggs. </p> <p>Which couldn't be said in 1980 when Philosophy Of The World got its first large-scale release.

Jonathan Richman, genuine naif if ever there was one, says: \"The Shaggs convince me that they're the real thing when they sing.\" </p> <p>With the Shaggs so easily misunderstood, you fear for what Hollywood could make of them. There was a rumour a few years back that closet 60s pop aficionado Tom Cruise had bought the rights to the Wiggin sisters' story. Suddenly the film is back on the agenda - Katherine (A Good Baby) Dieckmann is set to direct. A biopic of the group Lester Bangs once called \"the anti-power trio\" could be as risible as Oliver Stone's The Doors. Or it could be the best film about naive art since Tony Hancock's The Rebel.

A biopic of the group Lester Bangs once called \"the anti-power trio\" could be as risible as Oliver Stone's The Doors. Or it could be the best film about naive art since Tony Hancock's The Rebel. Here's hoping.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>I once saw a TV science programme in which the presenter encouraged a quietly steaming Icelandic geyser to dramatically \"blow\" a few seconds later by tipping into it a large quantity of soap bars. Can anyone explain this phenomenon?</b> <p> * I have seen this done. The geyser pool is at the top of a hole in the ground, perhaps 50m or more deep, full of water, which is continuously heated from the bottom by the adjacent mass of hot rock. Just before a natural \"blow\" the water towards the bottom will have reached a temperature well above normal boiling point, but it is prevented from boiling by pressure from the column above. Left to itself, the water will eventually become too hot for this unstable situation to persist; steam bubbles will form, and the geyser spontaneously \"blows\". To please an impatient audience, a travel guide can induce premature discharge by dropping soap into the pool. Arriving near the bottom, the soap starts to dissolve; as with any other solute, its presence depresses the boiling point of water, and steam-bubbles start to form and rise. Their arrival at the top usually causes a violent spillage of some water out of the pool. This reduces the weight of the column and its pressure, causing boiling of the whole column, as in a natural eruption. </p> <p> Tom Hering, Kegworth, Derby. </p> <p> <b> Just outside London's Liverpool Street station, between the tracks and the arches, there are a number of small \"memorial-type\" statues. What are they?</b> </p> <p> * The statues are some of the surviving decorative pieces of stone and brickwork from the old Liverpool Street station buildings that were demolished in the 1980s as part of the station redevelopment. Some of the carved stonework came from the old Hamilton House railway offices fronting Bishopsgate. Some of these show the initials GER (Great Eastern Railway), which built Liverpool Street station. There are also some examples of carved brickwork, shaped in the form of a half circle. There were originally six of these high on the wall of the building that was behind the concourse of platforms 11-18 of the old station. They depicted railway activities (signalman, porter, fireman, etc.) being undertaken by cherub-like beings. One of these has been incorporated into the new station, and at least one is in the site mentioned. The others seem to have been destroyed. The new station incorporates the carving mentioned as well as two others from the old station, one depicting a train and the other a ship. The war memorial and other memorial tablets from the old station have also survived and are on prominent display. </p> <p> Nigel Bowdidge, Brentwood, Essex. </p> <p> <b> Does the human race have a future longer than its past?</b> </p> <p> * Not according to the ancient Mayan people of South America. They claim that every cycle of life has five \"suns\", or ages, each of which is ended by a natural disaster, be it global freezing, a great meteor or a great flood. Their highly detailed calendar, which has predicted other events (such as the first world war) with great accuracy, shows us to be now living in the fifth, and last, sun of our life on earth. Furthermore, they have predicted that the present age will come to an end on December 23, 2012, in such a way that no human life will survive it. </p> <p> Hannah Rawlinson, Accra, Ghana. </p> <p>* Professor Joss Hawthorne is barking up the wrong science if he seeks support for an infinite human future from Frank Tipler (Notes &amp; Queries, July 13). Tipler envisages a finality to human evolution which negates the idea of an infinite future. Tipler's thesis is that there will come a specific point in time in the remote but finite future at which the human project will be complete. In his book, The Anthropic Cosmological Principle, Tipler and John D Barrow state that there is a logical conclusion or end-state to human progress. They state that humanity is destined to expand into the universe and gather all knowledge. When all the knowledge that it is logically possible to acquire has been gathered, the Omega Point will have been reached. This will be an omnipotent entity which will reverse time and raise the dead. The final sentence in Tipler and Barrow's book is: \"And this is the end.\" </p> <p> Peter Stockill, Berwick Hills, Middlesbrough. </p> <p> <b> Why are some countries, such as the Gambia, prefixed with \"the\", even when they are not plural (like the Netherlands)?</b> </p> <p> * There appear to be three rules: where countries are named after rivers or mountain ranges, for example, the Gambia, the Lebanon; where the final noun in the name is preceded by an adjective and/or \"of\", for example, the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Czech Republic; and for the plural names of island groups, for example, the Philippines, the Grenadines (islands or archipelagos ending in -a or -ia never take \"the\"). Of course, the rules in other European languages are completely different - for example, la France and die Schweiz . </p> <p> Alaisdair Raynham, Singapore. </p> <p>* There is a perfectly logical explanation as to why the country called Ukraine used to take a definite article. Under the Russian Empire, the part of Eastern Europe that is currently Ukraine and part of eastern Poland constituted the borderlands of the Empire - in Russian \"krai\" (\"edge\"). The Russian preposition \"u\", which is attached to the word \"krai\" as a prefix, means \"at\". This gives us the name \"Ukraina\", or \"The Edge of the Empire/Borderland\". The former use of the definite article in English (which does not exist in Russian) represented linguistic recognition of the political reality that what was then \"The Ukraine\" constituted the western limits of the Russian, and later the Soviet, empire. Since Ukraine became an independent country it has become a requirement in politically correct English to drop the article in deference to the fact that Ukraine, as an independent state, can no longer be considered a borderland territory of Russia. </p> <p> Brian Keegan, Paris. </p> <p>* To question Jim Burfield's assertion (Notes &amp; Queries, July 6) that The Hague is the only town on earth whose English name takes \"The\", a quick look in my atlas gives The Bight in the Bahamas, The Dalles in the USA, The Pas in Canada and The Rock and The Twins in Australia. </p> <p> Mike Rayner, Pity Me, Durham. </p> <p>* In Welsh we have Y Wyddfa for The Snowdon and Yr Albion for The Scotland among others. </p> <p> Bryn Gwyndaf Jones, Welwyn </p> <p>Garden City, Herts. </p> <p> <b> When a football match is televised, why is the camera always on only one side of the pitch?</b> </p> <p> * In film and television production a principle exists called the 180 degree rule: that two cameras should not face each other when filming the same subject. The reason for this is to stop the audience from becoming confused and disorientated. When you are watching from the stadium, you will sit on one side of the pitch, looking from one direction. When you watch the match on TV, you will watch the game from several angles thanks to the multi-camera set up. </p> <p>If the director was following a player with a camera on, say, the north side of the stadium then cut to another camera on the south side, the player on the screen will suddenly have appeared to change direction. If the second camera is on the same side of the pitch the player will continue in the same direction on the screen - this is called a \"match on action\". The same principle is used in most sports. </p> <p> Mike Harris, Colerne, Wilts. </p> <p> <b> Why do cigarette packets in vending machines have only 16 fags in them?</b> </p> <p> * For many years I worked in an American restaurant in London which had a machine dispensing packets containing 16 cigarettes. It was not possible to add the cost of the cigarettes to the restaurant bill, but as a courtesy the waiters would take the customers' change, get the cigarettes and return them to the table. On one occasion, an elderly American couple called me over to the table. \"I'm sorry to have to report this\", the husband said, \"but your waiter has stolen four of my cigarettes!\" No amount of explanation seemed to convince him otherwise. Needless to say, US cigarette vending machines dispense packs of 20. </p> <p> Russell Norman, London NW6. </p> <p><b> Any answers?</b></p> <p><b>I was brought up to believe that British subjects had certain freedoms - freedom of movement, assembly, speech etc, trial by jury, presumption of innocence, habeas corpus and so on.

Therefore, your interceptors really are not worth very much.\" In his evidence, reported yesterday, he said the failure of a missile interceptor in a test on July 8 \"called into question the realism\" of having a system in place by the current target of 2005, though that date should remain the goal for a limited shield. President Bill Clinton was expected to decide next month whether to start work on a radar station in Alaska next spring, Mr Cohen said. He played down cooperative overtures by Kim Jong-il of North Korea, and the Korean summit last month, saying: \"One summit doesn't change a tiger into a domestic cat.\"",

The heritage centre stands near the field where the Scottish flag was raised on the day that Robert the Bruce thrashed Edward I's English army in 1314. Next to the heritage centre is my parents' local, a pub called the 1314 Inn. It's the ugliest building I've ever seen - a concrete box squatting next to a main road. </p> <p>The 1314 Inn always worried me when I was growing up. Did Scotland's tourism bosses really think that people who had traipsed halfway around the world to see where Robert the Bruce had defeated the English army in 1314 might fancy a warm pint in a shabby concrete boozer afterwards? But it illustrates the way many people in Stirling regard their national heritage. Sometimes I think that if the Taj Mahal had been built in Bannockburn it would now be a Post Office depot. </p> <p>So I was hardly surprised at the news earlier this week that the local council in Stirling has given the go-ahead for houses to be built on another site on the battlefield. They have always been alarmingly relaxed about the national heritage under their stewardship. Their priorities are more \"progressive\" than that. You can never have too many pubs, after all. </p> <p>The present heritage centre at Bannockburn is hardly a world-beater. There's always been something tangibly desolate about the place - a windswept field on the edge of a housing estate with a concrete sculpture, a flagpole and a statue of Robert the Bruce. And we're lucky to have even that. Thirty years ago it too almost fell victim to the property developers until a benefactor saved it for the nation. But instead of a monument to the legendary warriors who gave Scotland a sense of national pride and identity, it feels vaguely tawdry. </p> <p>Perhaps it's because people are too apathetic to care. But that seems unlikely. Scottish schoolchildren have the significance of these events mercilessly drummed into them. Some of my most vivid memories from my time at Wallace High School (named after William \"Braveheart\" Wallace) are the history lessons about the 700-year-old battles for independence. Even at that age, the delicious sense of nonconformism wasn't lost on us. Here were our teachers openly imbuing us with tales of rebellion. And it only enriched the experience for me that I was sitting on the very ground where the English blood had been spilt. </p> <p>So why do these attempts to erase our past continue? Stirling is, admittedly, something of a special case. It's groaning under the weight of history. The place is littered with ancient buildings: a medieval cathedral, an ancient abbey and the best old-town walls in Scotland. The authorities must feel there's a law of diminishing returns. With so much else for tourists to see, a field doesn't seem so important. And, of course, there's always the visitor centre. Do we really need another one? </p> <p>Aside from the obvious ethical concerns, the issue also betrays a woeful complacency. The leaders of many towns would kill for Stirling's tourist business. But if tourists start to feel short-changed, there are plenty of other countries with ruins on offer. </p> <p>Ultimately, though, the current state of affairs in Stirling is unforgivable. And it seems to be part of a national malaise. When it comes to packaging ancient history, the English can be inspired in their torpor-inducing initiatives. The Stonehenge visitor centre, for one, is a national disgrace. But one could argue that the standing stones are too old to be a cultural reference point for the nation. Stirling's tourist attractions deal with the defining moments of Scotland's history. They're not only historically important but - as the country flirts with independence - symbolically significant. </p> <p>Possibly, though, I'm being too hard on Stirling. It is still a magical place, and the authorities aren't totally ignorant of the need to bring these historical events to life (although perhaps we should draw a veil over the plan to erect a William Wallace statue with Mel Gibson's face on it). One can only hope that it will stay that way in the years to come - despite the authorities' worst efforts. </p> <p>Of course, you may disagree. We need to move with the times, after all. So I'd be quite happy to talk it over. The only proviso is that we do it over a pint in the 1314 Inn. I don't expect many takers.</p>",

It was invented in 1917 by a Russian emigre called Lev Termen and was played in a strange way: the player's hands move close to the antennae but do not touch them. It has a spooky, cosmic-violin sound that must have appealed to Lenin because he asked for lessons and commissioned 600 to be made. </p> <p>The ondes martenot is even uglier: the instrument's keyboard stands free from the speaker, on top of which is a diffuser that looks like a bishop's mitre. And yet it is one of the most beautiful-sounding and, in Britain at least, unrecognised instruments invented in the last century. </p> <p>The theremin and the ondes martenot were precursors of the synthesiser, and radical musicians in the early 20th century seized on them hungrily. The French composer Edgard Var\u00e8se, for example, was a particular fan. He first used it as a substitute for sirens in a performance of his Am\u00e9riques in 1929. </p> <p>Var\u00e8se was so taken with the instrument that he re-wrote his 1933-4 choral work Ecuatorial, replacing the original two theremins with two ondes martenots - the version that will be performed tonight in a Prom given by the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group. </p> <p>\"Var\u00e8se had really been waiting for the ondes martenot to be invented so he could express himself as he had wanted,\" says Val\u00e9rie Hartmann-Claverie, one of the ondistes who will be performing Ecuatorial tonight. \"He re-scored the piece for the ondes martenot because it has the right nuances and pitches.\" </p> <p>But while the theremin became trapped in a repertoire of kitsch and cheesy effects, the ondes martenot has had a more distinguished, and very French, history. It was invented by Maurice Martenot - pianist, cellist, composer, and part-time electrician, who presented it to the public at a concert in 1928. </p> <p>The ondes martenot demands unusual dexterity from the performer. The keyboard controls the frequency of a variable oscillator and the signal is radiated as sound from a loudspeaker. The right hand plays the keyboard, and each key is capable of slight lateral movement, microtonally shifting the pitch and enabling the performer to create a vibrato. So far, so much like the theremin: composers such as Var\u00e8se thrilled to the new possibilities these instruments gave, not least the opportunity to abandon the chromatic scale and write microtonal intervals. </p> <p>But the ondes martenot can be played another way. The player attaches a finger ring to a ribbon and then sweeps the ribbon across a conducting strip that runs parallel to the keyboard. The left hand is used to control potentionmeters, which change the timbre and degree of amplification. This enables wide glissando sweeps and expressive portamentos undreamt of by Termen. </p> <p>\"It is an extremely difficult instrument to play. It's extraordinarily sensitive,\" says Hartmann-Claverie, who started playing the instrument at the age of 12. \"For me, when I studied the instrument at the conservatoire in Paris, it was very much the instrument of our days.\" </p> <p>She is typical of the many French musicians who have been captivated by the ondes martenot. Pierre Boulez briefly became a performer in the 40s and wrote an ondes martenot quartet just after the war. But arguably the greatest roles for the instruments were written by Messiaen. He wrote for six ondes martenot in F tes des Belles Eaux, and for one - to extraordinarily dramatic effect -in the Turangalla Symphony. He even put a gong in the diffuser, creating sounds that he described as \"strange, mysterious and unreal when they are soft, or cruel, lacerating and terrifying when forceful\". A wonderfully expressive instrument, then, well suited to a work about the divine action upon the cosmos, about love, life and death. </p> <p>But isn't the ondes martenot now just a museum piece that has been replaced by more sophisticated electronic instruments? \"Not at all,\" says Hartmann-Claverie. \"There is a repertoire of more than 1,200 pieces.

I am sure of it.\" </p> <p>The Birmingham Contemporary Music Group performs Var\u00e8se's Ecuatorial and Gerald Barry's Wiener Blut at the Albert Hall, London SW7 (020-7589 8212), tonight.</p>",

I suspect really she knows why we are not as glamorous as her. But in case she doesn't, I'll run through it - in a spirit more of explanation than of excuse.</p> <p>Glamour is a form of bondage. Of course, unsmudged lipstick and tidy hair are not in the same league as bound feet and faintingly tight corsets, but they have the same origin. A woman who is glamorous cannot \"do\" anything other than be glamorous. She cannot run for the bus in her four-inch heels, she cannot type her masterpiece, wash up her children's tea, carve her great work, play her fabulous sonata or her winning serve with long, long nails. She can hardly walk in the tight skirt; she can't bend over without her bosoms falling out of the low-cut blouse. She can't go out in the rain because she will be flooded with gunk off her hair, which will give her the appearance of a less than glamorous drowned rat. All this is fine if she doesn't want or have to do anything. But we do. Plenty.</p> <p>Glamour is time-consuming. Maintaining glamour is a full-time job, as Jilly Cooper pointed out in her novel Octavia: as soon as beautiful Octavia got a job, her looks went because she couldn't spend all day washing her hair, oiling her limbs, being massaged and buying lovely new clothes. Most of us have lives to live that take up our time and painting our toenails simply has to take its turn behind earning a living, running a home, having friends and/or family and/or fun and/or a lovelife ... Joan herself mentioned recently that she spent most of her time between takes on Dynasty wondering what to wear next. It's hard work, I can see that.</p> <p>Glamour is expensive, too. I am currently considering looking glamorous for the glamorous Mayfair launch party of my novel, but the expense involved in looking glamorous even for one night is startling. Massage 40 quid, leg-wax 20 quid, pedicure 15, hairdresser 100, exotic facial (with seaweed) 60, new outfit, say, 200 (and I'm not looking at huge extravagance here, I'm not planning on going to Bond Street). Sixty quid for delightful new shoes. A tenner for a pair of sleek tights. Were I to be starting from scratch on make-up and skincare, that could easily be another couple of hundred. Twenty quid handcreams, 30 quid liposome gunk, 12 quid stay-put lipstick in Joan Collins red. Then taxis everywhere and all that dry-cleaning, only champagne to drink ...</p> <p>In many ways it sounds fabulous, of course it does, but there's this thing, this real-life thing, that just gets in the way. In the old days, I suppose, we had servants and ladies' maids and dressers, and they did half the work for us. Unless of course we were servants or ladies' maids or dressers, in which case glamour - for goodness sake, girl, what are you thinking - would have been above our station. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I realise that the only suitable job for a woman who really wants to be glamorous is to be a film star.</p> <p>Glamour can be embarrassing. I don't like crossing over to my limousine looking like a million dollars and passing a woman wearing an old sleeping bag and a piece of last season's cardboard. In these scary days, plenty of people want the security of looking like each other and if that means the unglamorous lowest common denominator, so be it.</p> <p>But then there's that other glamour - glamour as Shakespeare used the word, the natural magical aura, the enchanting glamour, that some people, male or female, just have and everybody else wants either to have or, well, to have. That glamour, there is nothing you can do about. Marilyn Monroe, they say, could switch it on or off, but generally either you have it or you don't.</p> <p>Joan Collins, of course, has it in buckets.

      "body": "<p>In the early post-war era, two tenors dominated the scene where the lighter, lyrical roles were concerned. One was Ferruccio Tagliavini, he of the honeyed tone; the other was the more stylish, sober Cesare Valletti, who has died aged 77.</p> <p>His compact, slightly reedy tone and effortless technique were ideal for the tenor parts in Mozart, Rossini and Donizetti, and in those he was considered the true successor to the legendary Tito Schipa: Valletti matched his great predecessor in terms of fastidious style as exemplified in well-nigh faultless phrasing.</p> <p>His gifts were revealed to London's operatic public when he sang Fenton in Falstaff with the company of La Scala on its visit to Covent Garden in 1950. Here was the sweet, plangent tone and airy manner the role calls for, and some gift for acting. Unfortunately, he did not appear at the Royal Opera House again until 1958, when he was an impassioned Alfredo to Callas's legendary Violetta.</p> <p>By then his voice had strengthened while losing little of its old beauty of timbre, so that he was able to sing Alfredo's denunciation of Violetta in Act Two with the requisite strength; in the Act One and Act Three duets his style and tone were as appealing as ever.</p> <p>In the early 1960s, at the end of his foreshortened career, he gave a series of recitals at the Wigmore Hall of French and Italian repertory, which displayed his ease of manner and intelligence in a non-operatic context. His account of Pizzetti's I Pastori, a setting of a D'Annunzio poem about a shepherd longing for home, with its subtle inflections, still lingers in my mind, the very epitome of a certain kind of Italianate singing now seemingly lost. It is preserved on one of his RCA recital discs, which have become collectors' items. By then, unlike so many Italian tenors, he had become an accomplished recitalist.</p> <p>The main part of Valletti's international career was at New York's Metropolitan, with whom he appeared, at the home house or on tour, 113 times, from his admired debut as an elegant and much-praised Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni in 1953 through until 1959, when he left in a huff after a row with the dictatorial director, Rudolf Bing.

      "bodyText": "In the early post-war era, two tenors dominated the scene where the lighter, lyrical roles were concerned. One was Ferruccio Tagliavini, he of the honeyed tone; the other was the more stylish, sober Cesare Valletti, who has died aged 77. His compact, slightly reedy tone and effortless technique were ideal for the tenor parts in Mozart, Rossini and Donizetti, and in those he was considered the true successor to the legendary Tito Schipa: Valletti matched his great predecessor in terms of fastidious style as exemplified in well-nigh faultless phrasing. His gifts were revealed to London's operatic public when he sang Fenton in Falstaff with the company of La Scala on its visit to Covent Garden in 1950. Here was the sweet, plangent tone and airy manner the role calls for, and some gift for acting. Unfortunately, he did not appear at the Royal Opera House again until 1958, when he was an impassioned Alfredo to Callas's legendary Violetta. By then his voice had strengthened while losing little of its old beauty of timbre, so that he was able to sing Alfredo's denunciation of Violetta in Act Two with the requisite strength; in the Act One and Act Three duets his style and tone were as appealing as ever. In the early 1960s, at the end of his foreshortened career, he gave a series of recitals at the Wigmore Hall of French and Italian repertory, which displayed his ease of manner and intelligence in a non-operatic context. His account of Pizzetti's I Pastori, a setting of a D'Annunzio poem about a shepherd longing for home, with its subtle inflections, still lingers in my mind, the very epitome of a certain kind of Italianate singing now seemingly lost. It is preserved on one of his RCA recital discs, which have become collectors' items. By then, unlike so many Italian tenors, he had become an accomplished recitalist. The main part of Valletti's international career was at New York's Metropolitan, with whom he appeared, at the home house or on tour, 113 times, from his admired debut as an elegant and much-praised Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni in 1953 through until 1959, when he left in a huff after a row with the dictatorial director, Rudolf Bing. He was particularly feted for his Almaviva (The Barber of Seville) and Ernesto (Don Pasquale), but he also essayed the heavier parts of Pinkerton and Werther with appreciable success. Valletti was born in Rome and studied privately until making his debut, as Alfredo, at Bari in 1947. He came to prominence when he sang Don Narcisco in Il turco in Italia, with Callas and Mariano Stabile also in the cast, at Rome in 1950. He was soon in demand in the major houses in Italy, and began to record for the Italian company Cetra.

      "body": "<p>On August 19 1942, Lieutenant-Colonel Cecil Merritt, who has died aged 91, was commanding officer of the South Saskatchewan Regiment, part of the nearly 5,000-strong 2nd Canadian Infantry Division which, with 1,000 British commandos and 50 United States rangers, comprised the ground forces for Operation Jubilee, the disastrous attack on the French port of Dieppe. For the Canadians, in particular, few of whom had any battle experience, the Dieppe carnage was a baptism of fire which left a lasting legacy.</p> <p>Some claim Jubilee was a useless slaughter, others maintain it was a necessary, if costly, rehearsal for the Normandy landings two years later. The military purpose behind Dieppe was to gain experience of an opposed landing and capture of a continental port, and the lessons learned were closely studied by the D-Day planners.</p> <p>The attack called for assaults at five different points over a 15-mile front. Merritt's South Saskatchewan Regiment was assigned to Green Beach on the right flank and its objective was Pourville and the cliffs above.</p> <p>Landing in one wave in the early dawn, they were virtually unopposed until heavy firing broke out from German gun emplacements as they scaled the sea wall and advanced towards Pourville. Unfortunately, instead of landing astride the estuary of the river Scie, the Navy had put the battalion down too far west, on the wrong bank. This meant those companies assigned to take the high ground above the village had first to cross a bridge - which the Germans raked with heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. With the bridge covered with dead and wounded, the advance halted.</p> <p>Aware of the need to regain the initiative, Merritt stood up, took off his helmet and, waving it in his hand, walked on to the bridge shouting at his men: \"Come over! There's nothing to worry about here.\" Inspired by their CO's example, the men raced across in small groups while others swam the river making for the high ground and the enemy pillboxes. Merritt personally led survivors of at least four parties in turn across the bridge.</p> <p>With increasing casualties among his commanders, progress slowed, but Merritt led the remaining men forward and succeeded in clearing the pillboxes. Merritt himself silenced one post by throwing in grenades. Having lost most of his runners, he kept contact with his positions by moving from one to the other under heavy fire. Although twice wounded, and with his battalion reduced to fewer than 300 men, Merritt managed to hold on to the improvised perimeter.</p> <p>Just after 9am orders came through to withdraw, and the remaining troops pulled back to the beach. Here Merritt, collecting up every spare weapon he could find, set up a rearguard position in a small bandstand to cover the evacuation of the Canadian 6th Brigade. By 1.30pm, out of ammunition and with no chance of evacuation, but not willing to raise a white flag, Merritt sent a German prisoner forward to invite the enemy to take his surrender. The South Saskatchewans left 84 dead on the beach and 89 more, including Merritt and eight other officers, were taken prisoner. Of the 4,963 Canadians who embarked for the operation, only 2,210, including many wounded, returned to England. There were 3,367 casualties, including 1,946 taken prisoner; 907 Canadians were killed.</p> <p>The announcement of the award of the Victoria Cross to Merritt, published in The London Gazette of October 2, 1942, spoke of his \"matchless gallantry and inspiring leadership\" and concluded with these words: \"To this commanding officer's personal daring, the success of his unit's operations and the safe re-embarkation of a large portion of it were chiefly due.\" Merritt's VC was the first to a Canadian soldier in the second world war.</p> <p>Throughout his three years in prison camp, Merritt made life as difficult as possible for his captors, and he was eventually sent to Colditz. Following his release in 1945, he was mentioned in despatches for his leadership while in captivity.</p> <p>Merritt was born in Vancouver, British Columbia; his father, Major Cecil Merritt, was killed in the First World War at Ypres. Educated at University School, Victoria, he graduated from the Royal Military College, Ontario, in 1929 and, after studying law, was called to the British Columbian Bar in 1932. He had joined the Canadian Militia during the 1930s, being commissioned into the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. Mobilised in 1939 and promoted major, he held a number of staff appointments in England. In March, 1942, Merritt was promoted to command the South Saskatchewan Regiment.</p> <p>On his return to Canada in 1945, Merritt won the seat for the Vancouver-Burrard constituency as a Conservative. Following the re-election of the Liberals in 1949, Merritt, who had not greatly enjoyed being a back-bench MP, happily returned to his legal practice and rejoined the militia, commanding his original regiment, the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada.</p> <p>Merritt's wife predeceased him; he had two sons and a daughter. With his death, the number of living recipients of the VC is reduced to 24, of whom only one is Canadian.</p> <p>Cecil Charles Ingersoll Merritt, soldier, lawyer, politician, born November 10 1908; died July 12 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "On August 19 1942, Lieutenant-Colonel Cecil Merritt, who has died aged 91, was commanding officer of the South Saskatchewan Regiment, part of the nearly 5,000-strong 2nd Canadian Infantry Division which, with 1,000 British commandos and 50 United States rangers, comprised the ground forces for Operation Jubilee, the disastrous attack on the French port of Dieppe. For the Canadians, in particular, few of whom had any battle experience, the Dieppe carnage was a baptism of fire which left a lasting legacy. Some claim Jubilee was a useless slaughter, others maintain it was a necessary, if costly, rehearsal for the Normandy landings two years later. The military purpose behind Dieppe was to gain experience of an opposed landing and capture of a continental port, and the lessons learned were closely studied by the D-Day planners. The attack called for assaults at five different points over a 15-mile front. Merritt's South Saskatchewan Regiment was assigned to Green Beach on the right flank and its objective was Pourville and the cliffs above. Landing in one wave in the early dawn, they were virtually unopposed until heavy firing broke out from German gun emplacements as they scaled the sea wall and advanced towards Pourville. Unfortunately, instead of landing astride the estuary of the river Scie, the Navy had put the battalion down too far west, on the wrong bank. This meant those companies assigned to take the high ground above the village had first to cross a bridge - which the Germans raked with heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. With the bridge covered with dead and wounded, the advance halted. Aware of the need to regain the initiative, Merritt stood up, took off his helmet and, waving it in his hand, walked on to the bridge shouting at his men: \"Come over! There's nothing to worry about here.\" Inspired by their CO's example, the men raced across in small groups while others swam the river making for the high ground and the enemy pillboxes. Merritt personally led survivors of at least four parties in turn across the bridge. With increasing casualties among his commanders, progress slowed, but Merritt led the remaining men forward and succeeded in clearing the pillboxes. Merritt himself silenced one post by throwing in grenades. Having lost most of his runners, he kept contact with his positions by moving from one to the other under heavy fire. Although twice wounded, and with his battalion reduced to fewer than 300 men, Merritt managed to hold on to the improvised perimeter. Just after 9am orders came through to withdraw, and the remaining troops pulled back to the beach. Here Merritt, collecting up every spare weapon he could find, set up a rearguard position in a small bandstand to cover the evacuation of the Canadian 6th Brigade. By 1.30pm, out of ammunition and with no chance of evacuation, but not willing to raise a white flag, Merritt sent a German prisoner forward to invite the enemy to take his surrender. The South Saskatchewans left 84 dead on the beach and 89 more, including Merritt and eight other officers, were taken prisoner. Of the 4,963 Canadians who embarked for the operation, only 2,210, including many wounded, returned to England. There were 3,367 casualties, including 1,946 taken prisoner; 907 Canadians were killed. The announcement of the award of the Victoria Cross to Merritt, published in The London Gazette of October 2, 1942, spoke of his \"matchless gallantry and inspiring leadership\" and concluded with these words: \"To this commanding officer's personal daring, the success of his unit's operations and the safe re-embarkation of a large portion of it were chiefly due.\" Merritt's VC was the first to a Canadian soldier in the second world war. Throughout his three years in prison camp, Merritt made life as difficult as possible for his captors, and he was eventually sent to Colditz. Following his release in 1945, he was mentioned in despatches for his leadership while in captivity. Merritt was born in Vancouver, British Columbia; his father, Major Cecil Merritt, was killed in the First World War at Ypres. Educated at University School, Victoria, he graduated from the Royal Military College, Ontario, in 1929 and, after studying law, was called to the British Columbian Bar in 1932. He had joined the Canadian Militia during the 1930s, being commissioned into the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. Mobilised in 1939 and promoted major, he held a number of staff appointments in England. In March, 1942, Merritt was promoted to command the South Saskatchewan Regiment. On his return to Canada in 1945, Merritt won the seat for the Vancouver-Burrard constituency as a Conservative. Following the re-election of the Liberals in 1949, Merritt, who had not greatly enjoyed being a back-bench MP, happily returned to his legal practice and rejoined the militia, commanding his original regiment, the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. Merritt's wife predeceased him; he had two sons and a daughter. With his death, the number of living recipients of the VC is reduced to 24, of whom only one is Canadian. Cecil Charles Ingersoll Merritt, soldier, lawyer, politician, born November 10 1908; died July 12 2000",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> K V.39 has baffled Egyptologists since its discovery in 1899. The highest of all the tombs in the Valley of the Kings, it remains the most enigmatic.</p> <p> Some believe it was made to house the body of the warrior pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525-1504 BC). This would make it the first royal tomb to be built in ancient Egypt's famous necropolis. Others follow Howard Carter's original belief that the king was actually buried elsewhere. But KV.39 might be where royal mummies were rewrapped after the desecration of their original tombs further down the Valley. </p> <p> Amenhotep I's own mummy was actually discovered in a mass burial of pharaohs in the nearby cliffs of Deir el-Bahari. Like his illustrious companions he had been carefully rewrapped and placed inside a new coffin. Ancient dockets on the mummies show that they had been moved several times in an attempt to stay ahead of the ancient tomb robbers always on the look-out for the rich pickings adorning the bodies. But the mummies' final resting place had been well-chosen, and they remained hidden until their discovery in 1881.</p> <p> They were whisked away to Cairo's Egyptian Museum where today they lie in state. Some are on display in the royal mummy room while further bodies await redisplay in a second room now being prepared. All the pharaohs were unwrapped and examined shortly after their discovery, save for the ever-elusive Amenhotep I. </p> <p> Only his mummy remains as it was found, its 5ft 10in frame still hidden within its linen wrappings, the face covered with a painted burial mask and swathed in the garlands placed over him by pious hands almost 3,000 years ago. </p> <p>The king had been deified after his death alongside his mother and co-ruler Queen Ahmose-Nofertari, whose own superbly preserved mummy is that of a 70 year old woman with the family's characteristic buck teeth. The couple were especially venerated at Deir el-Medina, the village they founded to house those who built the royal tombs. </p> <p> So given the importance of KV.39 and its significance in the history of Egyptian burial practices, it seems all the more amazing that serious excavation only began in 1989, a full 90 years after its original discovery. Under the auspices of the American Pacific Western University and partly funded by ICI, John Rose and his team of British and Egyptian workers cleared the debris-filled tomb over five seasons. </p> <p>Their recently published findings have provided an accurate plan of its unusually complex design in which the standard \"corridor\" arrangement had been extended later by digging out two further passages. </p> <p>The large amounts of material discovered support the idea that the tomb once functioned as a macabre kind of restorer's workshop, the place chosen to repair the ravaged remains of great pharaohs such as Ramses II, Seti I and the \"Napoleon of ancient Egypt\" Tuthmosis III (1479-1425 BC). </p> <p> Standing only 5ft tall, Tuthmosis was the greatest of Egypt's warrior kings, expanding the Empire as far as the Euphrates River. His own wonderfully decorated tomb is the one closest to KV.39, and a popular spot with the tourists who clamber up a modern iron staircase to reach it. </p> <p> The electricity supply to Tuthmosis's tomb was harnessed to provide the light the team needed to work deep within the tomb in the hill above. Among piles of debris the archaeologists recovered painted coffin fragments, great quantities of mummy wrappings of various sorts and sizes and embalming materials such as resin.</p> <p> They even found a large golden signet ring, which after careful cleaning and conservation revealed the word \"Menkheperre\", throne name of Tuthmosis III himself. While analysing the ring, team member Stephen Buckley of Bristol University discovered what appeared to be traces of natron salts of the type used to dry the body during the mummification process.</p> <p> An analytical chemist specialising in mummification materials, Buckley believes that \"the ring may well have come from the mummy of Tuthmosis while it was being rewrapped\". </p> <p> During his analysis of the resins from the tomb Buckley also identified compounds found in myrrh, a preservative and anti-bacterial ingredient used in the preparation of bodies. His findings provide further interpretation of KV.39's history. </p> <p> \"Although we can never be 100% certain, the nature of the material we found leads me to think that the tomb could well be the place where royal mummies were restored prior to their reburial at Deir el-Bahari. In fact, much of the material we recovered still needs looking at, and would certainly repay careful study in the years to come\". </p> <p>There is more to emerge. It seems somehow appropriate that of all the tombs in the Valley of the Kings, it is KV.39 which lies closest to the summit of the natural pyramid-shaped peak of the Theban hills.</p> <p> It was thought to be home to the cobra goddess Meretseger, \"She who loves silence\". It is clear that this mysterious place has yet to give up all its secrets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "K V.39 has baffled Egyptologists since its discovery in 1899. The highest of all the tombs in the Valley of the Kings, it remains the most enigmatic. Some believe it was made to house the body of the warrior pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525-1504 BC). This would make it the first royal tomb to be built in ancient Egypt's famous necropolis. Others follow Howard Carter's original belief that the king was actually buried elsewhere. But KV.39 might be where royal mummies were rewrapped after the desecration of their original tombs further down the Valley. Amenhotep I's own mummy was actually discovered in a mass burial of pharaohs in the nearby cliffs of Deir el-Bahari. Like his illustrious companions he had been carefully rewrapped and placed inside a new coffin. Ancient dockets on the mummies show that they had been moved several times in an attempt to stay ahead of the ancient tomb robbers always on the look-out for the rich pickings adorning the bodies. But the mummies' final resting place had been well-chosen, and they remained hidden until their discovery in 1881. They were whisked away to Cairo's Egyptian Museum where today they lie in state. Some are on display in the royal mummy room while further bodies await redisplay in a second room now being prepared. All the pharaohs were unwrapped and examined shortly after their discovery, save for the ever-elusive Amenhotep I. Only his mummy remains as it was found, its 5ft 10in frame still hidden within its linen wrappings, the face covered with a painted burial mask and swathed in the garlands placed over him by pious hands almost 3,000 years ago. The king had been deified after his death alongside his mother and co-ruler Queen Ahmose-Nofertari, whose own superbly preserved mummy is that of a 70 year old woman with the family's characteristic buck teeth. The couple were especially venerated at Deir el-Medina, the village they founded to house those who built the royal tombs. So given the importance of KV.39 and its significance in the history of Egyptian burial practices, it seems all the more amazing that serious excavation only began in 1989, a full 90 years after its original discovery. Under the auspices of the American Pacific Western University and partly funded by ICI, John Rose and his team of British and Egyptian workers cleared the debris-filled tomb over five seasons. Their recently published findings have provided an accurate plan of its unusually complex design in which the standard \"corridor\" arrangement had been extended later by digging out two further passages. The large amounts of material discovered support the idea that the tomb once functioned as a macabre kind of restorer's workshop, the place chosen to repair the ravaged remains of great pharaohs such as Ramses II, Seti I and the \"Napoleon of ancient Egypt\" Tuthmosis III (1479-1425 BC). Standing only 5ft tall, Tuthmosis was the greatest of Egypt's warrior kings, expanding the Empire as far as the Euphrates River. His own wonderfully decorated tomb is the one closest to KV.39, and a popular spot with the tourists who clamber up a modern iron staircase to reach it. The electricity supply to Tuthmosis's tomb was harnessed to provide the light the team needed to work deep within the tomb in the hill above. Among piles of debris the archaeologists recovered painted coffin fragments, great quantities of mummy wrappings of various sorts and sizes and embalming materials such as resin. They even found a large golden signet ring, which after careful cleaning and conservation revealed the word \"Menkheperre\", throne name of Tuthmosis III himself. While analysing the ring, team member Stephen Buckley of Bristol University discovered what appeared to be traces of natron salts of the type used to dry the body during the mummification process. An analytical chemist specialising in mummification materials, Buckley believes that \"the ring may well have come from the mummy of Tuthmosis while it was being rewrapped\". During his analysis of the resins from the tomb Buckley also identified compounds found in myrrh, a preservative and anti-bacterial ingredient used in the preparation of bodies. His findings provide further interpretation of KV.39's history. \"Although we can never be 100% certain, the nature of the material we found leads me to think that the tomb could well be the place where royal mummies were restored prior to their reburial at Deir el-Bahari. In fact, much of the material we recovered still needs looking at, and would certainly repay careful study in the years to come\". There is more to emerge. It seems somehow appropriate that of all the tombs in the Valley of the Kings, it is KV.39 which lies closest to the summit of the natural pyramid-shaped peak of the Theban hills. It was thought to be home to the cobra goddess Meretseger, \"She who loves silence\". It is clear that this mysterious place has yet to give up all its secrets.",

But as NIAC director Dr Robert Cassanova says: \"What our active science programme will certainly do is enable us to have a much more efficient air transport system on earth, as well as providing better access to space.

In colleges and universities across the United States students are protesting about the sweatshop factory conditions that they claim are commonplace in the production of university-endorsed clothing.</p> <p>These factories are found throughout the third world in countries such as Guatemala, Nicaragua and Bangladesh.

In colleges and universities across the United States students are protesting about the sweatshop factory conditions that they claim are commonplace in the production of university-endorsed clothing. These factories are found throughout the third world in countries such as Guatemala, Nicaragua and Bangladesh. With more than 220 college and university student groups now members of the umbrella organisation that is coordinating the national campaign, United Students Against Sweatshops, the sweatshop issue is now recognised as the single biggest and fastest-growing campaign within American universities.

I recognise myself in him, and many others will find he has mirrored the blurred and mutable sense of self which comes with a life spent in transit between cultures.</p> <p>Iyer is a hybrid being or rather, to use his wry term, a mongrel. Despite being a stray, he has an impeccable pedigree. His parents were Indian intellectuals who migrated first to England and later to California. Votaries of the Raj, they sent their son to Eton.

Luckily, his family prepared him for an expatriate existence: they also called him Pico, after the Renaissance mystic Pico della Mirandola. This name carried a destiny with it, and when not on a plane, Iyer can sometimes be found in a monastery, where he goes to reflect on the absurdity of his other, airborne life.</p> <p>He quit England after graduating from Oxford, and now has an address in Santa Barbara. Nevertheless the United States classifies him as a resident alien, which is little better than an extraterrestrial. Actually, he lives in a mock-Californian suburb across the Pacific outside Osaka. His partner is a Japanese woman, with whom he shares no language - they converse in a postmodern pidgin. His employer, Time magazine, has its headquarters half a world away.</p> <p>Iyer's working life is jet-propelled. Time sends him to the Olympic Games, making him responsible for every sport on offer, so he races \"from cycling to three-day eventing to badminton arenas every day from dawn till after midnight for 16 days\". He then retreats for a while to his hermitage above the ocean - not to meditate, I suspect, but to sleep.</p> <p>Iyer's first collection of essays, Video Night In Kathmandu, took delight in the incongruity of a new, garishly Westernised Asia. Recently his tone has become more sober and philosophical. Falling Off The Map included an account of Cuba as an \"elegiac carnival\" and a haunting commentary on the loneliness of Australia, with its high, smiling, empty skies.</p> <p>The Global Soul retains the dizzy elation of his first book, but also stays true to the worried conscience, which first appeared in his memoir, The Lady And The Monk. Iyer rejoices in the gibberish of our international \"multiculture\" - on display, for instance, in his Japanese neighbourhood, where you can get your hair cut at the \"Louvre Miason de Coiffure\", the \"Mus\u00e9e Hair and Make\" or the \"Jollier Cut and Parm\" (whose name pays garbled homage to that hirsute goddess Julia Roberts). Yet he wonders whether the human soul can dilate to comprehend a world which lacks localities and the native affections they inspire. Despite Time's urgent orders to chase events, Iyer wants to be \"free, a little of the moment\" and to \"get such news as I need from the falling of the leaves\". The frequent flyer yearns to be grounded.</p> <p>He takes his mixed motives to a variety of symbolic settings, theme-parks of contemporary placelessness: the airport in Los Angeles, the chaotic marketplace of Hong Kong or the global village hurriedly constructed in Atlanta to house Olympic athletes. He touches down for an extended stay in Toronto, a \"global city\" where diversity creates \"not dissonance but a higher symphony\". Here, for once, he loses me. Toronto, flinching from the nearby US border, has always seemed to me too doughtily British for its own good.</p> <p>The book concludes in Kyoto, where Iyer falls into a \"deep, deep sleep\" and dreams, to his surprise, of England with its \"green, green hills\". The repetitive incantation reveals the poetic homesickness, which underlies all this hectic toing and froing. Jet lag deepens into a mystical reverie; like all travellers, Iyer is in search of a lost, fictional paradise.</p> <p>Supposedly about our shared future, The Global Soul ends by retreating into his personal past. Iyer several times quotes Jan Morris approvingly, his predecessor as a memorialist of Empire. More than travel writers, both are analysts of the unstable, fluctuant human state. But Morris has managed to combine a career of exhausting itineracy with a reverence for home, identified by her with the green, green hills of Wales.</p> <p>Iyer's remembered hills, by contrast, are no more than a mirage.

      "bodyText": "A federal judge in San Francisco yesterday ordered Napster, the internet service that allows the trading of MP3 sound files by linking personal computers, to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by major music labels. The preliminary injunction, which could effectively shut down Napster's service, represents a major victory for the world's five largest record companies who are suing Napster for copyright infringement. In granting the industry's request for a preliminary injunction, Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of the US district court in San Francisco ruled that the hugely popular Napster service, with an estimated 20m users, was used primarily to trade copyrighted material with the full knowledge of Napster. \"A majority of Napster users use the service to download and upload copyrighted music,\" she said. The injunction is scheduled to take effect at midnight on Friday and will continue pending trial. The case represents a landmark in the uncharted waters of internet copyright law, with policy-makers, lawyers, consumers and entrepreneurs watching closely. Legal experts have also said the implications for the case extend beyond music, to the sharing of other media like movies, and may set the tone for how intellectual property law is defined on the Internet. Napster's head lawyer David Boies said the company would appeal immediately. \"[The injunction] does not give us any fair ability to comply and still operate,\" he said.

The recording industry declared the decision a major and complete victory. Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America, said: \"This sends the message to others who are building businesses based on other people's copyrighted works without permission.\" Representatives of the rock group Metallica and the artist Dr Dre, who are taking separate action against Napster, called the decision a \"huge win.\" Although Metallica have consistently attacked Napster for stealing people's music, the company's service is championed by other artists such as Courtney Love and Public Enemy. The recording association said it would post a $5m bond requested by the judge against any financial losses Napster could suffer from being shut down pending the trial. Napster had asked for a bond of at least $800m. Napster's service makes use of MP3 - a file format that allows the storage of music files on a personal computer in small packets of data - by providing software which enables internet users to see what MP3 files other Napster users have stored in their computers. Using the software, users can search and download songs from other people's computers. Napster was created last year by a 19-year-old computer student Shawn Fanning, whilst he was toying around with the web at the University of Michigan. The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner Inc, the Sony Corp, Bertelsmann and other record companies, represented by The Recording Industry Association of America, sued the service for copyright infringement. The recording association asserts Napster is guilty of contributory copyright infringement. The industry contends that Napster has built a business by encouraging individual users to share files of music they do not own. But Napster claims that the online trading of MP3 music files falls within the parameters of the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act which permits copying music for personal use.

      "bodyText": "Britain's 850,000 health care professionals will be offered free internet-enabled mobile phones under an agreement between The Carphone Warehouse and medical information company Health-Media.Net. Doctors, nurses, dentists and care assistants will be given Wap phones if they subscribe to Health-Media.Net's news service - which provides a regular flow of stories affecting the industry. The news service, which is free of charge to medical professionals, is already available on the internet. However, Health-Media.Net believes few health workers have access to computers so it wants to connect them using phones. Tony Fitzpatrick, Health-Media.Net's chief executive, said: \"We're going to give them a very cheap deal so that on the way to work, doctors and nurses will be able to catch up with all the latest headline news about health care.\" Several medical associations have agreed to promote the offer to members, including the British Association of Dental Nurses and the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists. Mr Fitzpatrick said talks were under way with others. The Carphone Warehouse will charge users \u00a312.99 monthly line rental and will throw in a free pay-as-you-go phone for partners. Health-Media.Net is gearing up for a flotation - planned for late this year or early next year. The company is being advised by Investec Henderson Crosthwaite. Health-Media.Net has 35,000 subscribers to its on-line news service. It sells news to other media organisations. Mr Fitzpatrick, a former television producer, said several big acquisitions were in the pipeline, including purchases of medical journals.",

      "body": "<p> The Halifax has just delayed the launch of its internet bank, Intelligent Finance, for a month because it doesn't work properly. It's easy to understand why Jim Spowart, IF's chief executive, is wary: the Prudential's Egg collapsed when it was launched, and last month, Cahoot, the Abbey National's online bank, went down in less than 90 minutes, swamped by the number of would-be customers. He doesn't want to make it three in a row. </p> <p> These are merely the latest in a long series of well-publicised problems with websites including Boo, the failed fashion retailer, Microsoft's Hotmail email service, and eBay, the giant auction site. America Online, the world's largest internet service provider, once went down for 19 hours, depriving net addicts of their vital \"fix\" of email and chat. </p> <p> Computer problems stretch far beyond the internet. Last month, travellers were delayed at many British airports after air traffic control computers at West Drayton, near Heathrow, shut themselves down because data in a software upgrade did not fit the space allowed for it. In April, the London Stock Exchange was brought to a standstill on what should have been its busiest day after overnight computer processing took longer than expected, and share prices were scrambled. In both cases, minor glitches led to major problems. </p> <p> The British government has had even more trouble with computer projects, this month's possible loss of millions of tax records being a relatively minor example. Recent disasters include Pathway, the Post Office's swipe-card project, which was being developed with the Benefits Agency, problems with the national insurance recording system, the immigration and nationality directorate computer, and the Home Office's passport system. </p> <p> The parliamentary public accounts committee, looking into these problems, found more than 30 government computer projects that had gone seriously wrong. The committee's chairman reportedly observed that \"a number of the departments appear before you so often that they are almost like old friends\". </p> <p> But while a lot of big computer projects go wrong, in the sense that they come in late or over budget, so do ones that have nothing to do with computers: big projects are inherently difficult to manage. Governments may do worse than private industry because civil servants are less good at project management, or because governments attempt more big computer projects than private companies, or because government computer failures are harder to hush up. </p> <p> Whatever the case, everyday life is now so dependent on computers that their failure could conceivably lead to real disasters, and the recent century date-change problem - known as the Millennium Bug - had many people contemplating the breakdown of society. </p> <p>Actually, most computer systems work most of the time, and it is journalistic hyperbole to describe service failures as disasters. </p> <p> Arthur Lawrence, chairman of the British Computer Society's specialist group on safety-critical systems, says: \"People who don't know anything about it tend to think disasters are happening all the time, when they're not. A computer failure is an inconvenience or an embarrassment rather than a disaster. Most people in the safety-critical computing industry are working to ensure that disasters can't happen.\" </p> <p> A spokesman for National Air Traffic Services (Nats) was also quick to stress that while the failure of the air traffic control computers \"did cause some difficulties, obviously, there was no loss of safety. And, in fact, on the day in question, there were no safety-related incidents\".</p> <p> Air traffic controllers had to revert to \"a manual system, which was slower, so the number of flights was curtailed, but there wasn't actually anything dangerous\".</p> <p> The spokesman also argued that the IBM mainframe-based flight data processing system had run at 99.99% availability in 1999, which was an improvement on the 99.97% availability achieved the previous year. \"This was the first major failure in 15 years.\" </p> <p> In the computer industry, 99.99% availability - which allows downtime of 53 minutes a year - is not considered particularly noteworthy. The more challenging and much more expensive target is \"five nines\" or 99.999% - an average annual downtime of nearer five minutes - but Nats only quotes figures to two decimal places. </p> <p> So far, building computer systems that provide \"five nines\" or 24/7 (24 hours a day, seven days a week) operation has been a specialist job. Over the past 20 years, the main suppliers have been Tandem, which was taken over by Compaq, and Stratus, which provided IBM with hardware it resold as the System/88. In a fault-tolerant system, you can remove a major component - a processor chip or hard drive - and it will keep going. But such systems are expensive, because they are based on specialised software and highly-redundant hardware. </p> <p> David Chalmers, from Stratus, says things are about to change. Previously mainly banks and other financial service providers bought fault-tolerant systems because they were handling transactions that could be valued - someone taking money from a cash machine, for example. \"On the web,\" Chalmers says, \"every transaction has a value.

      "bodyText": "The Halifax has just delayed the launch of its internet bank, Intelligent Finance, for a month because it doesn't work properly. It's easy to understand why Jim Spowart, IF's chief executive, is wary: the Prudential's Egg collapsed when it was launched, and last month, Cahoot, the Abbey National's online bank, went down in less than 90 minutes, swamped by the number of would-be customers. He doesn't want to make it three in a row. These are merely the latest in a long series of well-publicised problems with websites including Boo, the failed fashion retailer, Microsoft's Hotmail email service, and eBay, the giant auction site. America Online, the world's largest internet service provider, once went down for 19 hours, depriving net addicts of their vital \"fix\" of email and chat. Computer problems stretch far beyond the internet. Last month, travellers were delayed at many British airports after air traffic control computers at West Drayton, near Heathrow, shut themselves down because data in a software upgrade did not fit the space allowed for it. In April, the London Stock Exchange was brought to a standstill on what should have been its busiest day after overnight computer processing took longer than expected, and share prices were scrambled. In both cases, minor glitches led to major problems. The British government has had even more trouble with computer projects, this month's possible loss of millions of tax records being a relatively minor example. Recent disasters include Pathway, the Post Office's swipe-card project, which was being developed with the Benefits Agency, problems with the national insurance recording system, the immigration and nationality directorate computer, and the Home Office's passport system. The parliamentary public accounts committee, looking into these problems, found more than 30 government computer projects that had gone seriously wrong. The committee's chairman reportedly observed that \"a number of the departments appear before you so often that they are almost like old friends\". But while a lot of big computer projects go wrong, in the sense that they come in late or over budget, so do ones that have nothing to do with computers: big projects are inherently difficult to manage. Governments may do worse than private industry because civil servants are less good at project management, or because governments attempt more big computer projects than private companies, or because government computer failures are harder to hush up. Whatever the case, everyday life is now so dependent on computers that their failure could conceivably lead to real disasters, and the recent century date-change problem - known as the Millennium Bug - had many people contemplating the breakdown of society. Actually, most computer systems work most of the time, and it is journalistic hyperbole to describe service failures as disasters. Arthur Lawrence, chairman of the British Computer Society's specialist group on safety-critical systems, says: \"People who don't know anything about it tend to think disasters are happening all the time, when they're not. A computer failure is an inconvenience or an embarrassment rather than a disaster. Most people in the safety-critical computing industry are working to ensure that disasters can't happen.\" A spokesman for National Air Traffic Services (Nats) was also quick to stress that while the failure of the air traffic control computers \"did cause some difficulties, obviously, there was no loss of safety. And, in fact, on the day in question, there were no safety-related incidents\". Air traffic controllers had to revert to \"a manual system, which was slower, so the number of flights was curtailed, but there wasn't actually anything dangerous\". The spokesman also argued that the IBM mainframe-based flight data processing system had run at 99.99% availability in 1999, which was an improvement on the 99.97% availability achieved the previous year. \"This was the first major failure in 15 years.\" In the computer industry, 99.99% availability - which allows downtime of 53 minutes a year - is not considered particularly noteworthy. The more challenging and much more expensive target is \"five nines\" or 99.999% - an average annual downtime of nearer five minutes - but Nats only quotes figures to two decimal places. So far, building computer systems that provide \"five nines\" or 24/7 (24 hours a day, seven days a week) operation has been a specialist job. Over the past 20 years, the main suppliers have been Tandem, which was taken over by Compaq, and Stratus, which provided IBM with hardware it resold as the System/88. In a fault-tolerant system, you can remove a major component - a processor chip or hard drive - and it will keep going. But such systems are expensive, because they are based on specialised software and highly-redundant hardware. David Chalmers, from Stratus, says things are about to change. Previously mainly banks and other financial service providers bought fault-tolerant systems because they were handling transactions that could be valued - someone taking money from a cash machine, for example. \"On the web,\" Chalmers says, \"every transaction has a value. When eBay went down, its market capitalisation shrank by $3bn.\" In effect, the web has brought many companies' \"back office\" computer systems not just in to the \"front office\", it has put them on a global stage. \"Today when your system goes down, everybody knows,\" says Chalmers. \"The online economy needs what we do.\" Naturally he has something to sell: ftServer computers that Stratus plans to launch at the end of the year. The new design will be based on Intel's next-generation 64-bit processor, codenamed McKinley, and Microsoft's forthcoming data centre version of Windows 2000.
